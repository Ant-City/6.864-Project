  i slid back
the panelled sides, got in with my light, pulled them together again, and
felt secure against the vigilance of heathcliff, and every one else.

the ledge, where i placed my candle, had a few mildewed books piled up in
one corner; and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint.  this
writing, however, was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of
characters, large and small--_catherine earnshaw_, here and there varied
to _catherine heathcliff_, and then again to _catherine linton_.

in vapid listlessness i leant my head against the window, and continued
spelling over catherine earnshaw--heathcliff--linton, till my eyes
closed; but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white
letters started from the dark, as vivid as spectres--the air swarmed with
catherines; and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name, i discovered
my candle-wick reclining on one of the antique volumes, and perfuming the
place with an odour of roasted calf-skin.  i snuffed it off, and, ve

awake, but forgotten.  'i must stop it, nevertheless!' i muttered,
knocking my knuckles through the glass, and stretching an arm out to
seize the importunate branch; instead of which, my fingers closed on the
fingers of a little, ice-cold hand!  the intense horror of nightmare came
over me: i tried to draw back my arm, but the hand clung to it, and a
most melancholy voice sobbed, 'let me in--let me in!'  'who are you?' i
asked, struggling, meanwhile, to disengage myself.  'catherine linton,'
it replied, shiveringly (why did i think of _linton_?  i had read
_earnshaw_ twenty times for linton)--'i'm come home: i'd lost my way on
the moor!'  as it spoke, i discerned, obscurely, a child's face looking
through the window.  terror made me cruel; and, finding it useless to
attempt shaking the creature off, i pulled its wrist on to the broken
pane, and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the
bedclothes: still it wailed, 'let me in!' and maintained its tenacious
grip,

 asked heathcliff, 'and what are you doing?  lie down
and finish out the night, since you _are_ here; but, for heaven's sake!
don't repeat that horrid noise: nothing could excuse it, unless you were
having your throat cut!'

'if the little fiend had got in at the window, she probably would have
strangled me!' i returned.  'i'm not going to endure the persecutions of
your hospitable ancestors again.  was not the reverend jabez branderham
akin to you on the mother's side?  and that minx, catherine linton, or
earnshaw, or however she was called--she must have been a
changeling--wicked little soul!  she told me she had been walking the
earth these twenty years: a just punishment for her mortal
transgressions, i've no doubt!'

scarcely were these words uttered when i recollected the association of
heathcliff's with catherine's name in the book, which had completely
slipped from my memory, till thus awakened.  i blushed at my
inconsideration: but, without showing further consciousness of the

to thrushcross grange, as soon as he heard of a good tenant he could not
have borne to miss the chance of getting a few hundreds more.  it is
strange people should be so greedy, when they are alone in the world!'

'he had a son, it seems?'

'yes, he had one--he is dead.'

'and that young lady, mrs. heathcliff, is his widow?'

'yes.'

'where did she come from originally?'

'why, sir, she is my late master's daughter: catherine linton was her
maiden name.  i nursed her, poor thing!  i did wish mr. heathcliff would
remove here, and then we might have been together again.'

'what!  catherine linton?' i exclaimed, astonished.  but a minute's
reflection convinced me it was not my ghostly catherine.  'then,' i
continued, 'my predecessor's name was linton?'

'it was.'

on the father's side: heathcliff married mr. linton's sister.'

'i see the house at wuthering heights has "earnshaw" carved over the
front door.  are they an old family?'

'very old, sir; and hareton is the last of them, as our miss cathy is of
us--i mean, of the lintons.  have you been to wuthering heights?  i beg
pardon for asking; but i should like to hear how she is!'

'mrs. heathcliff? she looked very well, and very handsome; yet, i think,
not very happy.'

'oh dear, i don't wonder!  and how did you like the master?'

'a rough fellow, rather, mrs. dean.  is not that his character?

'rough as a saw-edge, and hard as whinstone!  the less you meddle with
him the better.'

'he must have had some ups and downs in life to make him such a churl.  do

us did not wish to fret the master, so we humoured his partiality; and
that humouring was rich nourishment to the child's pride and black
tempers. still it became in a manner necessary; twice, or thrice,
hindley's manifestation of scorn, while his father was near, roused the
old man to a fury: he seized his stick to strike him, and shook with
rage that he could not do it.

at last, our curate (we had a curate then who made the living answer by
teaching the little lintons and earnshaws, and farming his bit of land
himself) advised that the young man should be sent to college; and mr.
earnshaw agreed, though with a heavy spirit, for he said--'hindley was
nought, and would never thrive as where he wandered.'

i hoped heartily we should have peace now.  it hurt me to think the
master should be made uncomfortable by his own good deed.  i fancied the
discontent of age and disease arose from his family disagreements; as he
would have it that it did: really, you know,

waited to put out the candle, he continued--'cathy and i escaped from
the wash-house to have a ramble at liberty, and getting a glimpse of the
grange lights, we thought we would just go and see whether the lintons
passed their sunday evenings standing shivering in corners, while their
father and mother sat eating and drinking, and singing and laughing, and
burning their eyes out before the fire. do you think they do? or reading
sermons, and being catechised by their manservant, and set to learn a
column of scripture names, if they don't answer properly?' 'probably
not,' i responded. 'they are good children, no doubt, and don't deserve

 under the drawing-room window. the light came
from thence; they had not put up the shutters, and the curtains were
only half closed. both of us were able to look in by standing on the
basement, and clinging to the ledge, and we saw--ah! it was beautiful--a
splendid place carpeted with crimson, and crimson-covered chairs and
tables, and a pure white ceiling bordered by gold, a shower of
glass-drops hanging in silver chains from the centre, and shimmering
with little soft tapers. old mr. and mrs. linton were not there; edgar
and his sisters had it entirely to themselves. shouldn't they have been
happy? we should have thought ourselves in heaven! and now, guess what
your good children were doing? isabella--i believe she is eleven, a year
younger than cathy--lay screaming at the farther end of the room,
shrieking as if witches were running red-hot needles into her. edgar
stood on the hearth weeping silently, and in the middle of the table sat
a little dog, shaking its paw and yelping; which, fro

of warm hair, and each begin to cry because both, after struggling to
get it, refused to take it. we laughed outright at the petted things; we
did despise them! when would you catch me wishing to have what catherine
wanted? or find us by ourselves, seeking entertainment in yelling, and
sobbing, and rolling on the ground, divided by the whole room? i'd not
exchange, for a thousand lives, my condition here, for edgar linton's at
thrushcross grange--not if i might have the privilege of flinging joseph
off the highest gable, and painting the house-front with hindley's
blood!'

'hush, hush!' i interrupted.  'still you have not told me, heathcliff,
how catherine is left behind?'

'i told you we laughed,' he answered. 'the lintons heard us, and with
one accord they shot like arrows to the door; there was silence, and
then a cry, "oh, mamma, mamma! oh, papa! oh, mamma, come here. oh, papa,

to cram it down his throat. a beast of a servant came
up with a lantern, at last, shouting--"keep fast, skulker, keep fast!"
he changed his note, however, when he saw skulker's game. the dog was
throttled off; his huge, purple tongue hanging half a foot out of his
mouth, and his pendent lips streaming with bloody slaver. the man took
cathy up; she was sick: not from fear, i'm certain, but from pain. he
carried her in; i followed, grumbling execrations and vengeance. "what
prey, robert?" hallooed linton from the entrance. "skulker has caught a
little girl, sir," he replied; "and there's a lad here," he added,
making a clutch at me, "who looks an out-and-outer! very like the
robbers were for putting them through the window to open the doors to
the gang after all were asleep, that they might murder us at their ease.

gallows for this. mr. linton, sir, don't lay by your gun." "no, no,

chandelier, and mrs. linton placed her spectacles on her nose and raised
her hands in horror. the cowardly children crept nearer also, isabella
lisping--"frightful thing! put him in the cellar, papa. he's exactly
like the son of the fortune-teller that stole my tame pheasant. isn't
he, edgar?"

was the curate, sir) '"that he lets her grow up in absolute heathenism.

return, i intended shattering their great glass panes to a million of
fragments, unless they let her out.  she sat on the sofa quietly.  mrs.
linton took off the grey cloak of the dairy-maid which we had borrowed
for our excursion, shaking her head and expostulating with her, i
suppose: she was a young lady, and they made a distinction between her
treatment and mine.  then the woman-servant brought a basin of warm
water, and washed her feet; and mr. linton mixed a tumbler of negus, and
isabella emptied a plateful of cakes into her lap, and edgar stood gaping
at a distance.  afterwards, they dried and combed her beautiful hair, and
gave her a pair of enormous slippers, and wheeled her to the fire; and i
left her, as merry as she could be, dividing her food between the little
dog and skulker, whose nose she pinched as he ate; and kindling a spark
of spirit in the vacant blue eyes of the lintons--a dim reflection from
her own enchanting face.  i saw

'there will more come of this business than you reckon on,' i answered,
covering him up and extinguishing the light.  'you are incurable,
heathcliff; and mr. hindley will have to proceed to extremities, see if
he won't.'  my words came truer than i desired.  the luckless adventure
made earnshaw furious.  and then mr. linton, to mend matters, paid us a
visit himself on the morrow, and read the young master such a lecture on
the road he guided his family, that he was stirred to look about him, in
earnest.  heathcliff received no flogging, but he was told that the first
word he spoke to miss catherine should ensure a dismissal; and mrs.
earnshaw undertook to keep her sister-in-law in due restraint when she
returned home; employing art, not force: with force she would have found
it impossible.

ead of a wild, hatless
little savage jumping into the house, and rushing to squeeze us all
breathless, there 'lighted from a handsome black pony a very dignified
person, with brown ringlets falling from the cover of a feathered beaver,
and a long cloth habit, which she was obliged to hold up with both hands
that she might sail in.  hindley lifted her from her horse, exclaiming
delightedly, 'why, cathy, you are quite a beauty!  i should scarcely have
known you: you look like a lady now.  isabella linton is not to be
compared with her, is she, frances?'  'isabella has not her natural
advantages,' replied his wife: 'but she must mind and not grow wild again
here.  ellen, help miss catherine off with her things--stay, dear, you
will disarrange your curls--let me untie your hat.'

i removed the habit, and there shone forth beneath a grand plaid silk
frock, white trousers, and burnished shoes; and, while her eyes sparkled
joyfully when the dogs came bounding up to welcome her, she dared hardly

cathy, catching a glimpse of her friend in his concealment, flew to
embrace him; she bestowed seven or eight kisses on his cheek within the
second, and then stopped, and drawing back, burst into a laugh,
exclaiming, 'why, how very black and cross you look! and how--how funny
and grim!  but that's because i'm used to edgar and isabella linton.
well, heathcliff, have you forgotten me?'

she had some reason to put the question, for shame and pride threw double
gloom over his countenance, and kept him immovable.

'shake hands, heathcliff,' said mr. earnshaw, condescendingly; 'once in a
way that is permitted.'

'i shall not,' replied the boy, finding his tongue at last; 'i shall not
stand to be laughed at.  i shall not bear it!'  and he would have broken
from the circle, but miss cathy seized him again.

r playing lady's-maid to the new-comer, and putting my cakes in the
oven, and making the house and kitchen cheerful with great fires,
befitting christmas-eve, i prepared to sit down and amuse myself by
singing carols, all alone; regardless of joseph's affirmations that he
considered the merry tunes i chose as next door to songs.  he had retired
to private prayer in his chamber, and mr. and mrs. earnshaw were engaging
missy's attention by sundry gay trifles bought for her to present to the
little lintons, as an acknowledgment of their kindness.  they had invited
them to spend the morrow at wuthering heights, and the invitation had
been accepted, on one condition: mrs. linton begged that her darlings
might be kept carefully apart from that 'naughty swearing boy.'

under these circumstances i remained solitary.  i smelt the rich scent of
the heating spices; and admired the shining kitchen utensils, the
polished clock, decked in holly, the silver mugs ranged on a tray ready
to be filled with mull

'yes: you had the reason of going to bed with a proud heart and an empty
stomach,' said i.  'proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves.  but,
if you be ashamed of your touchiness, you must ask pardon, mind, when she
comes in.  you must go up and offer to kiss her, and say--you know best
what to say; only do it heartily, and not as if you thought her converted
into a stranger by her grand dress.  and now, though i have dinner to get
ready, i'll steal time to arrange you so that edgar linton shall look
quite a doll beside you: and that he does.  you are younger, and yet,
i'll be bound, you are taller and twice as broad across the shoulders;
you could knock him down in a twinkling; don't you feel that you could?'

heathcliff's face brightened a moment; then it was overcast afresh, and
he sighed.

'but, nelly, if i knocked him down twenty times, that wouldn't make him
less handsome or me more so.  i wish i had light hair and a fair skin,

'in other words, i must wish for edgar linton's great blue eyes and even
forehead,' he replied.  'i do--and that won't help me to them.'

'a good heart will help you to a bonny face, my lad,' i continued, 'if
you were a regular black; and a bad one will turn the bonniest into
something worse than ugly.  and now that we've done washing, and combing,
and sulking--tell me whether you don't think yourself rather handsome?

of my birth; and the thoughts of what i was should give me courage and
dignity to support the oppressions of a little farmer!'

so i chattered on; and heathcliff gradually lost his frown and began to
look quite pleasant, when all at once our conversation was interrupted by
a rumbling sound moving up the road and entering the court.  he ran to
the window and i to the door, just in time to behold the two lintons
descend from the family carriage, smothered in cloaks and furs, and the
earnshaws dismount from their horses: they often rode to church in
winter.  catherine took a hand of each of the children, and brought them
into the house and set them before the fire, which quickly put colour
into their white faces.

i urged my companion to hasten now and show his amiable humour, and he
willingly obeyed; but ill luck would have it that, as he opened the door

they met, and the master, irritated at seeing him clean and cheerful, or,
perhaps, eager to keep his promise to mrs. linton, shoved him back with a
sudden thrust, and angrily bade joseph 'keep the fellow out of the
room--send him into the garret till dinner is over.  he'll be cramming
his fingers in the tarts and stealing the fruit, if left alone with them
a minute.'

'nay, sir,' i could not avoid answering, 'he'll touch nothing, not he:
and i suppose he must have his share of the dainties as well as we.'

'he shall have his share of my hand, if i catch him downstairs till
dark,' cried hindley.  'begone, you vagabon

doorway; 'i wonder they don't make his head ache.  it's like a colt's
mane over his eyes!'

he ventured this remark without any intention to insult; but heathcliff's
violent nature was not prepared to endure the appearance of impertinence
from one whom he seemed to hate, even then, as a rival.  he seized a
tureen of hot apple sauce (the first thing that came under his grip) and
dashed it full against the speaker's face and neck; who instantly

fit of passion, for he appeared red and breathless.  i got the dishcloth,
and rather spitefully scrubbed edgar's nose and mouth, affirming it
served him right for meddling.  his sister began weeping to go home, and
cathy stood by confounded, blushing for all.

'you should not have spoken to him!' she expostulated with master linton.
'he was in a bad temper, and now you've spoilt your visit; and he'll be
flogged: i hate him to be flogged!  i can't eat my dinner.  why did you
speak to him, edgar?'

'i didn't,' sobbed the youth, escaping from my hands, and finishing the
remainder of the purification with his cambric pocket-handkerchief.  'i
promised mamma that i wouldn't say one word to him, and i didn't.'

 over them.  she slipped her fork to the
floor, and hastily dived under the cloth to conceal her emotion.  i did
not call her unfeeling long; for i perceived she was in purgatory
throughout the day, and wearying to find an opportunity of getting by
herself, or paying a visit to heathcliff, who had been locked up by the
master: as i discovered, on endeavouring to introduce to him a private
mess of victuals.

in the evening we had a dance.  cathy begged that he might be liberated
then, as isabella linton had no partner: her entreaties were vain, and i

excitement of the exercise, and our pleasure was increased by the arrival
of the gimmerton band, mustering fifteen strong: a trumpet, a trombone,

 companions formed a pretty example for
catherine and heathcliff.  his treatment of the latter was enough to make
a fiend of a saint.  and, truly, it appeared as if the lad _were_
possessed of something diabolical at that period.  he delighted to
witness hindley degrading himself past redemption; and became daily more
notable for savage sullenness and ferocity.  i could not half tell what
an infernal house we had.  the curate dropped calling, and nobody decent
came near us, at last; unless edgar linton's visits to miss cathy might
be an exception.  at fifteen she was the queen of the country-side; she
had no peer; and she did turn out a haughty, headstrong creature!  i own
i did not like her, after infancy was past; and i vexed her frequently by
trying to bring down her arrogance: she never took an aversion to me,
though.  she had a wondrous constancy to old attachments: even heathcliff
kept his hold on her affections unalterably; and young linton, with all
his superiority, found it difficult

figure almost too graceful.  i did not marvel how catherine earnshaw
could forget her first friend for such an individual.  i marvelled much
how he, with a mind to correspond with his person, could fancy my idea of
catherine earnshaw.

'a very agreeable portrait,' i observed to the house-keeper.  'is it
like?'

'yes,' she answered; 'but he looked better when he was animated; that is
his everyday countenance: he wanted spirit in general.'

catherine had kept up her acquaintance with the lintons since her
five-weeks' residence among them; and as she had no temptation to show
her rough side in their company, and had the sense to be ashamed of
being rude where she experienced such invariable courtesy, she imposed
unwittingly on the old lady and gentleman by her ingenious cordiality;
gained the admiration of isabella, and the heart and soul of her
brother: acquisitions that flattered her from the first--for she was
full of ambition--and led her to adopt a double character without

had a terror of earnshaw's reputation, and shrunk from encountering him;
and yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility: the
master himself avoided offending him, knowing why he came; and if he
could not be gracious, kept out of the way.  i rather think his
appearance there was distasteful to catherine; she was not artful, never
played the coquette, and had evidently an objection to her two friends
meeting at all; for when heathcliff expressed contempt of linton in his
presence, she could not half coincide, as she did in his absence; and
when linton evinced disgust and antipathy to heathcliff, she dared not
treat his sentiments with indifference, as if depreciation of her
playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her.  i've had many a laugh
at her perplexities and untold troubles, which she vainly strove to hide
from my mockery.  that sounds ill-natured: but she was so proud it became
really impossible to pity her distresses, till she should be chas

'hindley does not often free us from his accursed presence,' observed the
boy.  'i'll not work any more to-day: i'll stay with you.'

'oh, but joseph will tell,' she suggested; 'you'd better go!'

'joseph is loading lime on the further side of penistone crags; it will
take him till dark, and he'll never know.'

so, saying, he lounged to the fire, and sat down.  catherine reflected an
instant, with knitted brows--she found it needful to smooth the way for
an intrusion.  'isabella and edgar linton talked of calling this
afternoon,' she said, at the conclusion of a minute's silence.  'as it
rains, i hardly expect them; but they may come, and if they do, you run
the risk of being scolded for no good.'

'order ellen to say you are engaged, cathy,' he persisted; 'don't turn me
out for those pitiful, silly friends of yours!  i'm on the point,
sometimes, of complaining that they--but i'll not--'

'that they what?' cried catherine, gazing at him with a troubled
countenance.  'oh, nelly!' she ad

ded petulantly, jerking her head away
from my hands, 'you've combed my hair quite out of curl!  that's enough;
let me alone.  what are you on the point of complaining about,
heathcliff?'

'nothing--only look at the almanack on that wall;' he pointed to a framed
sheet hanging near the window, and continued, 'the crosses are for the
evenings you have spent with the lintons, the dots for those spent with
me.  do you see?  i've marked every day.'

'yes--very foolish: as if i took notice!' replied catherine, in a peevish
tone.  'and where is the sense of that?'

'to show that i _do_ take notice,' said heathcliff.

'and should i always be sitting with you?' she demanded, growing more
irritated.  'what good do i get?  what do you talk about?  you might be
dumb, or a baby, for anything you say to amuse me, or for anything you
do, either!'

'you never told me before th

'it's no company at all, when people know nothing and say nothing,' she
muttered.

her companion rose up, but he hadn't time to express his feelings
further, for a horse's feet were heard on the flags, and having knocked
gently, young linton entered, his face brilliant with delight at the
unexpected summon she had received.  doubtless catherine marked the
difference between her friends, as one came in and the other went out.
the contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak, hilly, coal
country for a beautiful fertile valley; and his voice and greeting were
as opposite as his aspect.  he had a sweet, low manner of speaking, and
pronounced his words as you do: that's less gruff than we talk here, and
softer.

'i'm not come t

oo soon, am i?' he said, casting a look at me: i had begun
to wipe the plate, and tidy some drawers at the far end in the dresser.

'no,' answered catherine.  'what are you doing there, nelly?'

'my work, miss,' i replied.  (mr. hindley had given me directions to make
a third party in any private visits linton chose to pay.)

she stepped behind me and whispered crossly, 'take yourself and your
dusters off; when company are in the house, servants don't commence
scouring and cleaning in the room where they are!'

'it's a good opportunity, now that master is away,' i answered aloud: 'he
hates me to be fidgeting over these things in his presence.  i'm sure mr.
edgar will excuse me.'

'i hate you to be fidgeting in _my_ presence,' exclaimed the young lady
imperiously, not allowing her guest time to speak:

to repeat the act, and her ears red with rage.  she never had power to
conceal her passion, it always set her whole complexion in a blaze.

'what's that, then?' i retorted, showing a decided purple witness to
refute her.

she stamped her foot, wavered a moment, and then, irresistibly impelled
by the naughty spirit within her, slapped me on the cheek: a stinging
blow that filled both eyes with water.

'catherine, love!  catherine!' interposed linton, greatly shocked at the
double fault of falsehood and violence which his idol had committed.

'leave the room, ellen!' she repeated, trembling all over.

insulted visitor moved to the spot where he had laid his hat, pale and
with a quivering lip.

'that's right!' i said to myself.  'take warning and begone!  it's a
kindness to let you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition.'

'where are you going?' demanded catherine, advancing to the door.

he swerved aside, and attempted to pass.

'you must not go!' she exclaimed, energetically.

'i must and shall!' he replied in a subdued voice.

'no,' she persisted, grasping the handle; 'not yet, edgar linton: sit
down; you shall not leave me in that temper.  i should be miserable all
night, and i won't be miserable for you!'

'can i stay after you have struck me?' asked linton.

catherine was mute.

'you've made me afraid and ashamed of you,' he continued; 'i'll not come
here again!'

her eyes began to glisten and her lids to twinkle.

'and you told a deliberate untruth!' he said.

'i didn't!' she cried, recovering her speech; 'i did nothing
deliberately.  well, go, if you please--get away!  and no

t was: he turned
abruptly, hastened into the house again, shut the door behind him; and
when i went in a while after to inform them that earnshaw had come home
rabid drunk, ready to pull the whole place about our ears (his ordinary
frame of mind in that condition), i saw the quarrel had merely effected a
closer intimacy--had broken the outworks of youthful timidity, and
enabled them to forsake the disguise of friendship, and confess
themselves lovers.

intelligence of mr. hindley's arrival drove linton speedily to his horse,
and catherine to her chamber.  i went to hide little hareton, and to take
the shot out of the master's fowling-piece, which he was fond of playing
with in his insane excitement, to the hazard of the lives of any who
provoked, or even attracted his notice too much; and i had hit upon the
plan of removing it, that he might do less mischief if he did go the
length of firing the gun.

'a pity,' observed i.  'you're hard to please; so many friends and so few
cares, and can't make yourself content!'

'nelly, will you keep a secret for me?' she pursued, kneeling down by me,
and lifting her winsome eyes to my face with that sort of look which
turns off bad temper, even when one has all the right in the world to
indulge it.

'is it worth keeping?' i inquired, less sulkily.

'yes, and it worries me, and i must let it out!  i want to know what i
should do.  to-day, edgar linton has asked me to marry him, and i've
given him an answer.  now, before i tell you whether it was a consent or
denial, you tell me which it ought to have been.'

'really, miss catherine, how can i know?' i replied.  'to be sure,
considering the exhibition you performed in his presence this afternoon,
i might say it would be wise to refuse him: since he asked you after
that, he must either be hopelessly stupid or a venturesome fool.'

'if you talk so, i won't tell you any more,' she returned, peev

'but there are several other handsome, rich young men in the world:
handsomer, possibly, and richer than he is.  what should hinder you from
loving them?'

'if there be any, they are out of my way: i've seen none like edgar.'

'you may see some; and he won't always be handsome, and young, and may
not always be rich.'

'he is now; and i have only to do with the present.  i wish you would
speak rationally.'

'well, that settles it: if you have only to do with the present, marry
mr. linton.'

'i don't want your permission for that--i _shall_ marry him: and yet you
have not told me whether i'm right.'

'perfectly right; if people be right to marry only for the present.  and
now, let us hear what you are unhappy about.  your brother will be
pleased; the old lady and gentleman will not object, i think; you will
escape from a disorderly, comfortless home into a wealthy, respectable
one; and you love edgar, and edgar loves you.  all seems smooth and easy:
where is the obstacle?'

she laughed, and held me down; for i made a motion to leave my chair.

'this is nothing,' cried she: 'i was only going to say that heaven did
not seem to be my home; and i broke my heart with weeping to come back to
earth; and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the
middle of the heath on the top of wuthering heights; where i woke sobbing
for joy.  that will do to explain my secret, as well as the other.  i've
no more business to marry edgar linton than i have to be in heaven; and
if the wicked man in there had not brought heathcliff so low, i shouldn't
have thought of it.  it would degrade me to marry heathcliff now; so he
shall never know how i love him: and that, not because he's handsome,
nelly, but because he's more myself than i am.  whatever our souls are
made of, his and mine are the same; and linton's is as different as a
moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire.'

not know what being in love is!'

'i see no reason that he should not know, as well as you,' i returned;
'and if you are his choice, he'll be the most unfortunate creature that
ever was born!  as soon as you become mrs. linton, he loses friend, and
love, and all!  have you considered how you'll bear the separation, and
how he'll bear to be quite deserted in the world?  because, miss
catherine--'

'he quite deserted! we separated!' she exclaimed, with an accent of
indignation.  'who is to separate us, pray?  they'll meet the fate of

my true feelings towards him.  nelly, i see now you think me a selfish
wretch; but did it never strike you that if heathcliff and i married, we
should be beggars? whereas, if i marry linton i can aid heathcliff to
rise, and place him out of my brother's power.'

'with your husband's money, miss catherine?' i asked.  'you'll find him
not so pliable as you calculate upon: and, though i'm hardly a judge, i
think that's the worst motive you've given yet for being the wife of
young linton.'

'it is not,' retorted she; 'it is the best!  the others were the
satisfaction of my whims: and for edgar's sake, too, to satisfy him.  this

told him to be off: because i knew you would not like to have met him as
you were.'

'you lie, cathy, no doubt,' answered her brother, 'and you are a
confounded simpleton!  but never mind linton at present: tell me, were
you not with heathcliff last night?  speak the truth, now.  you need not
be afraid of harming him: though i hate him as much as ever, he did me a
good turn a short time since that will make my conscience tender of
breaking his neck.  to prevent it, i shall send him about his business
this very morning; and after he's gone, i'd advise you all to look sharp:
i shall only have the more humour for you.'

had a fever.  he bled her, and he told me to let her live on whey and
water-gruel, and take care she did not throw herself downstairs or out of
the window; and then he left: for he had enough to do in the parish,
where two or three miles was the ordinary distance between cottage and
cottage.

though i cannot say i made a gentle nurse, and joseph and the master were
no better, and though our patient was as wearisome and headstrong as a
patient could be, she weathered it through.  old mrs. linton paid us
several visits, to be sure, and set things to rights, and scolded and
ordered us all; and when catherine was convalescent, she insisted on
conveying her to thrushcross grange: for which deliverance we were very
grateful.  but the poor dame had reason to repent of her kindness: she
and her husband both took the fever, and died within a few days of each
other.

our young lady returned to us saucier and more passionate, and haughtier
than ever.  heathcliff had never been heard of since the

s than murder in her eyes for any
one to presume to stand up and contradict her.  from mr. earnshaw and his
companions she kept aloof; and tutored by kenneth, and serious threats of
a fit that often attended her rages, her brother allowed her whatever she
pleased to demand, and generally avoided aggravating her fiery temper.  he
was rather too indulgent in humouring her caprices; not from affection,
but from pride: he wished earnestly to see her bring honour to the family
by an alliance with the lintons, and as long as she let him alone she
might trample on us like slaves, for aught he cared!  edgar linton, as
multitudes have been before and will be after him, was infatuated: and
believed himself the happiest man alive on the day he led her to
gimmerton chapel, three years subsequent to his father's death.

much against my inclination, i was persuaded to leave wuthering heights
and accompany her here. little hareton was nearly five years old, and i
had just begun to teach him his letters.  we

'much.'

'that's good news.'

i got miss catherine and myself to thrushcross grange; and, to my
agreeable disappointment, she behaved infinitely better than i dared to
expect.  she seemed almost over-fond of mr. linton; and even to his
sister she showed plenty of affection.  they were both very attentive to
her comfort, certainly.  it was not the thorn bending to the
honeysuckles, but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn.  there were no
mutual concessions: one stood erect, and the others yielded: and who can
be ill-natured and bad-tempered when they encounter neither opposition
nor indifference?  i observed that mr. edgar had a deep-rooted fear of
ruffling her humour.  he concealed it from her; but if ever he

'how will she take it?' i exclaimed.  'what will she do?  the surprise
bewilders me--it will put her out of her head!  and you _are_ heathcliff!
but altered!  nay, there's no comprehending it.  have you been for a
soldier?'

'go and carry my message,' he interrupted, impatiently.  'i'm in hell
till you do!'

he lifted the latch, and i entered; but when i got to the parlour where
mr. and mrs. linton were, i could not persuade myself to proceed.  at
length i resolved on making an excuse to ask if they would have the
candles lighted, and i opened the door.

they sat together in a window whose lattice lay back against the wall,
and displayed, beyond the garden trees, and the wild green park, the
valley of gimmerton, with a long line of mist winding nearly to its top
(for very soon after you pass the chapel, as you may have noticed, the

uthering heights rose above this silvery vapour; but our old
house was invisible; it rather dips down on the other side.  both the
room and its occupants, and the scene they gazed on, looked wondrously
peaceful.  i shrank reluctantly from performing my errand; and was
actually going away leaving it unsaid, after having put my question about
the candles, when a sense of my folly compelled me to return, and mutter,
'a person from gimmerton wishes to see you ma'am.'

'what does he want?' asked mrs. linton.

'i did not question him,' i answered.

'well, close the curtains, nelly,' she said; 'and bring up tea.  i'll be
back again directly.'

she quitted the apartment; mr. edgar inquired, carelessly, who it was.

'some one mistress does not expect,' i replied.  'that heathcliff--you
recollect him, sir--who used to live at mr. earnshaw's.'

'what! the gipsy--the ploughboy?' he cried.  'why did you not say so to
catherine?'

'hush! you must not call him by those names, master,' i said.  'she'd be

ly grieved to hear you.  she was nearly heartbroken when he ran off.  i
guess his return will make a jubilee to her.'

mr. linton walked to a window on the other side of the room that
overlooked the court.  he unfastened it, and leant out.  i suppose they
were below, for he exclaimed quickly: 'don't stand there, love!  bring
the person in, if it be anyone particular.'  ere long, i heard the click
of the latch, and catherine flew up-stairs, breathless and wild; too
excited to show gladness: indeed, by her face, you would rather have
surmised an awful calamity.

'oh, edgar, edgar!' she panted, flinging her arms round his ne

embrace to a squeeze.

'well, well,' cried her husband, crossly, 'don't strangle me for that!  he
never struck me as such a marvellous treasure.  there is no need to be
frantic!'

'i know you didn't like him,' she answered, repressing a little the
intensity of her delight.  'yet, for my sake, you must be friends now.
shall i tell him to come up?'

'here,' he said, 'into the parlour?'

'where else?' she asked.

he looked vexed, and suggested the kitchen as a more suitable place for
him.  mrs. linton eyed him with a droll expression--half angry, half
laughing at his fastidiousness.

'no,' she added, after a while; 'i cannot sit in the kitchen.  set two
tables here, ellen: one for your master and miss isabella, being gentry;
the other for heathcliff and myself, being of the lower orders.  will
that please you, dear?  or must i have a fire lighted elsewhere?  if so,
give directions.  i'll run down and secure my guest.  i'm afraid the joy
is too great to be real!'

she was about to dart off ag

i descended, and found heathcliff waiting under the porch, evidently
anticipating an invitation to enter.  he followed my guidance without
waste of words, and i ushered him into the presence of the master and
mistress, whose flushed cheeks betrayed signs of warm talking.  but the
lady's glowed with another feeling when her friend appeared at the door:
she sprang forward, took both his hands, and led him to linton; and then
she seized linton's reluctant fingers and crushed them into his.  now,
fully revealed by the fire and candlelight, i was amazed, more than ever,
to behold the transformation of heathcliff.  he had grown a tall,
athletic, well-formed man; beside whom my master seemed quite slender and
youth-like.  his upright carriage suggested the idea of his having been
in the army.  his countenance was much older in expression and decision
of feature than mr. linton's; it looked intelligent, and ret

marks of former degradation.  a half-civilised ferocity lurked yet in the
depressed brows and eyes full of black fire, but it was subdued; and his
manner was even dignified: quite divested of roughness, though stern for
grace.  my master's surprise equalled or exceeded mine: he remained for a
minute at a loss how to address the ploughboy, as he had called him.
heathcliff dropped his slight hand, and stood looking at him coolly till
he chose to speak.

'sit down, sir,' he said, at length.  'mrs. linton, recalling old times,
would have me give you a cordial reception; and, of course, i am
gratified when anything occurs to please her.'

'and i also,' answered heathcliff, 'especially if it be anything in which
i have a part.  i shall stay an hour or two willingly.'

he took a seat opposite catherine, who kept her gaze fixed on him as if
she feared he would vanish were she to remove it.  he did not raise his
to her often: a quick glance now and then sufficed; but it flashed back,

'catherine, unless we are to have cold tea, please to come to the table,'
interrupted linton, striving to preserve his ordinary tone, and a due
measure of politeness.  'mr. heathcliff will have a long walk, wherever
he may lodge to-night; and i'm thirsty.'

she took her post before the urn; and miss isabella came, summoned by the
bell; then, having handed their chairs forward, i left the room.  the
meal hardly endured ten minutes.  catherine's cup was never filled: she
could neither eat nor drink.  edgar had made a slop in his saucer, and
scarcely swallowed a mouthful.  their guest did

i was cruel and selfish for wishing to talk when he was so sick and
sleepy.  he always contrives to be sick at the least cross!  i gave a few
sentences of commendation to heathcliff, and he, either for a headache or
a pang of envy, began to cry: so i got up and left him.'

'what use is it praising heathcliff to him?' i answered.  'as lads they
had an aversion to each other, and heathcliff would hate just as much to
hear him praised: it's human nature.  let mr. linton alone about him,
unless you would like an open quarrel between them.'

'but does it not show great weakness?' pursued she.  'i'm not envious: i
never feel hurt at the brightness of isabella's yellow hair and the
whiteness of her skin, at her dainty elegance, and the fondness all the
family exhibit for her.  even you, nelly, if we have a dispute sometimes,
you back isabella at once; and i yield like a foolish mother: i call her

see us cordial, and that pleases me.  but they are very much alike: they
are spoiled children, and fancy the world was made for their
accommodation; and though i humour both, i think a smart chastisement
might improve them all the same.'

'you're mistaken, mrs. linton,' said i.  'they humour you: i know what
there would be to do if they did not.  you can well afford to indulge
their passing whims as long as their business is to anticipate all your
desires.  you may, however, fall out, at last, over something of equal
consequence to both sides; and then those you term weak are very capable
of being as obstinate as you.'

'and then we shall fight to the death, sha'n't we, nelly?' she returned,
laughing.  'no! i tell you, i have such faith in linton's love, tha

together; and likewise a hope that i shall have more opportunities of
seeing him there than i could have if he settled in gimmerton.  he means
to offer liberal payment for permission to lodge at the heights; and
doubtless my brother's covetousness will prompt him to accept the terms:
he was always greedy; though what he grasps with one hand he flings away
with the other.'

'it's a nice place for a young man to fix his dwelling in!' said i.  'have
you no fear of the consequences, mrs. linton?'

'none for my friend,' she replied: 'his strong head will keep him from
danger; a little for hindley: but he can't be made morally worse than he
is; and i stand between him and bodily harm.  the event of this evening
has reconciled me to god and humanity!  i had risen in angry rebellion
against providence.  oh, i've endured very, very bitter misery, nelly!  if
that creature knew how bitter, he'd be ashamed to cloud its removal with
idle petulance.  it was kindness for him which induced me to

and i'll take no revenge on his folly; i can afford to suffer anything

only turn the other, but i'd ask pardon for provoking it; and, as a
proof, i'll go make my peace with edgar instantly.  good-night!  i'm an
angel!'

in this self-complacent conviction she departed; and the success of her
fulfilled resolution was obvious on the morrow: mr. linton had not only
abjured his peevishness (though his spirits seemed still subdued by
catherine's exuberance of vivacity), but he ventured no objection to her
taking isabella with her to wuthering heights in the afternoon; and she
rewarded him with such a summer of sweetness and affection in return as
made the house a paradise for several days; both master and servants
profiting from the perpetual sunshine.

ion.  catherine, also, deemed it
judicious to moderate her expressions of pleasure in receiving him; and
he gradually established his right to be expected.  he retained a great
deal of the reserve for which his boyhood was remarkable; and that served
to repress all startling demonstrations of feeling.  my master's
uneasiness experienced a lull, and further circumstances diverted it into
another channel for a space.

his new source of trouble sprang from the not anticipated misfortune of
isabella linton evincing a sudden and irresistible attraction towards the
tolerated guest.  she was at that time a charming young lady of eighteen;
infantile in manners, though possessed of keen wit, keen feelings, and a
keen temper, too, if irritated.  her brother, who loved her tenderly, was
appalled at this fantastic preference.  leaving aside the degradation of
an alliance with a nameless man, and the possible fact that his property,
in default of heirs male, might pass into such a one's power, he had
sens

 though his
exterior was altered, his mind was unchangeable and unchanged.  and he
dreaded that mind: it revolted him: he shrank forebodingly from the idea
of committing isabella to its keeping.  he would have recoiled still more
had he been aware that her attachment rose unsolicited, and was bestowed
where it awakened no reciprocation of sentiment; for the minute he
discovered its existence he laid the blame on heathcliff's deliberate
designing.

we had all remarked, during some time, that miss linton fretted and pined
over something.  she grew cross and wearisome; snapping at and teasing
catherine continually, at the imminent risk of exhausting her limited
patience.  we excused her, to a certain extent, on the plea of
ill-health: she was dwindling and fading before our eyes.  but one day,
when she had been peculiarly wayward, rejecting her breakfast,
complaining that the servants did not do what she told them; that the
mistress would allow her to be nothing in the house, and edgar neglected

her; that she had caught a cold with the doors being left open, and we
let the parlour fire go out on purpose to vex her, with a hundred yet
more frivolous accusations, mrs. linton peremptorily insisted that she
should get to bed; and, having scolded her heartily, threatened to send
for the doctor.  mention of kenneth caused her to exclaim, instantly,
that her health was perfect, and it was only catherine's harshness which
made her unhappy.

'how can you say i am harsh, you naughty fondling?' cried the mistress,
amazed at the unreasonable assertion.  'you are surely losing your
reason.  when have i been harsh, tell me?'

'yesterday,' sobbed isabella, 'and now!'

n what occasion?'

'in our walk along the moor: you told me to ramble where i pleased, while
you sauntered on with mr. heathcliff!'

'and that's your notion of harshness?' said catherine, laughing.  'it was
no hint that your company was superfluous?  we didn't care whether you
kept with us or not; i merely thought heathcliff's talk would have
nothing entertaining for your ears.'

'oh, no,' wept the young lady; 'you wished me away, because you knew i
liked to be there!'

'is she sane?' asked mrs. linton, appealing to me.  'i'll repeat our
conversation, word for word, isabella; and you point out any charm it
could have had for you.'

'i don't mind the conversation,' she answered: 'i wanted to be with--'

'well?' said catherine, perceiving her hesitate to complete the sentence.

'with him: and i won't be always sent off!' she continued, kindling up.
'you are a dog in the manger, cathy, and desire no one to be loved but
yourself!'

'you are an impertinent little monkey!' exclaimed mrs. linton, in

head.  pray, don't imagine that he conceals
depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern exterior!  he's not a
rough diamond--a pearl-containing oyster of a rustic: he's a fierce,
pitiless, wolfish man.  i never say to him, "let this or that enemy
alone, because it would be ungenerous or cruel to harm them;" i say, "let
them alone, because _i_ should hate them to be wronged:" and he'd crush
you like a sparrow's egg, isabella, if he found you a troublesome charge.
i know he couldn't love a linton; and yet he'd be quite capable of
marrying your fortune and expectations: avarice is growing with him a
besetting sin.  there's my picture: and i'm his friend--so much so, that
had he thought seriously to catch you, i should, perhaps, have held my

miss linton regarded her sister-in-law with indignation.

'for shame! for shame!' she repeated, angrily.  'you are worse than
twenty foes, you poisonous friend!'

'ah! you won't believe me, then?' said catheri

'i'm certain you do,' retorted isabella; 'and i shudder at you!'

'good!' cried the other.  'try for yourself, if that be your spirit: i
have done, and yield the argument to your saucy insolence.'--

'and i must suffer for her egotism!' she sobbed, as mrs. linton left the
room.  'all, all is against me: she has blighted my single consolation.
but she uttered falsehoods, didn't she?  mr. heathcliff is not a fiend:
he has an honourable soul, and a true one, or how could he remember her?'

'banish him from your thoughts, miss,' i said.  'he's a bird of bad omen:

her.  she is better acquainted with his heart than i, or any one besides;

'you are leagued with the rest, ellen!' she replied.  'i'll not listen to
your slanders.  what malevolence you must have to wish to convince me
that there is no happiness in the world!'

whether she would have got over this fancy if left to herself, or
persevered in nursing it perpetually, i cannot say: she had little time

the truth and not slander me, even in joke!  mr. heathcliff, be kind
enough to bid this friend of yours release me: she forgets that you and i
are not intimate acquaintances; and what amuses her is painful to me
beyond expression.'

as the guest answered nothing, but took his seat, and looked thoroughly
indifferent what sentiments she cherished concerning him, she turned and
whispered an earnest appeal for liberty to her tormentor.

'by no means!' cried mrs. linton in answer.  'i won't be named a dog in
the manger again.  you _shall_ stay: now then!  heathcliff, why don't you
evince satisfaction at my pleasant news?  isabella swears that the love
edgar has for me is nothing to that she entertains for you.  i'm sure she
made some speech of the kind; did she not, ellen?  and she has fasted
ever since the day before yesterday's walk, from sorrow and rage that i
despatched her out of your society under the idea of its being
unacceptable.'

'i think you belie

the aversion it raises.
the poor thing couldn't bear that; she grew white and red in rapid
succession, and, while tears beaded her lashes, bent the strength of her
small fingers to loosen the firm clutch of catherine; and perceiving that
as fast as she raised one finger off her arm another closed down, and she
could not remove the whole together, she began to make use of her nails;
and their sharpness presently ornamented the detainer's with crescents of
red.

'there's a tigress!' exclaimed mrs. linton, setting her free, and shaking
her hand with pain.  'begone, for god's sake, and hide your vixen face!
how foolish to reveal those talons to him.  can't you fancy the
conclusions he'll draw?  look, heathcliff! they are instruments that will
do execution--you must beware of your eyes.'

'i'd wrench them off her fingers, if they ever menaced me,' he answered,
brutally, when the door had closed after her.  'but what did you mean by
teasing the creature in that manner, cathy?  you were not speaking

gating her adoration.  but don't notice it
further: i wished to punish her sauciness, that's all.  i like her too
well, my dear heathcliff, to let you absolutely seize and devour her up.'

'and i like her too ill to attempt it,' said he, 'except in a very
ghoulish fashion.  you'd hear of odd things if i lived alone with that
mawkish, waxen face: the most ordinary would be painting on its white the
colours of the rainbow, and turning the blue eyes black, every day or
two: they detestably resemble linton's.'

'delectably!' observed catherine.  'they are dove's eyes--angel's!'

'she's her brother's heir, is she not?' he asked, after a brief silence.

'i should be sorry to think so,' returned his companion.  'half a dozen
nephews shall erase her title, please heaven!  abstract your mind from
the subject at present: you are too prone to covet your neighbour's
goods; remember _this_ neighbour's goods are mine.'

'if they were _mine_, they would be none the less that,' said heathcliff;
'but though i

from their tongues they did dismiss it; and catherine, probably, from her
thoughts.  the other, i felt certain, recalled it often in the course of
the evening.  i saw him smile to himself--grin rather--and lapse into
ominous musing whenever mrs. linton had occasion to be absent from the
apartment.

i determined to watch his movements.  my heart invariably cleaved to the
master's, in preference to catherine's side: with reason i imagined, for
he was kind, and trustful, and honourable; and she--she could not be
called _opposite_, yet she seemed to allow herself such wide latitude,
that i had little faith in her principles, and still less sympathy for
her feelings.  i wanted something to happen which might have the effect
of freeing both wutheri

ut, instead of hindley,
heathcliff appeared on the door-stones; and i turned directly and ran
down the road as hard as ever i could race, making no halt till i gained
the guide-post, and feeling as scared as if i had raised a goblin.  this
is not much connected with miss isabella's affair: except that it urged
me to resolve further on mounting vigilant guard, and doing my utmost to
check the spread of such bad influence at the grange: even though i
should wake a domestic storm, by thwarting mrs. linton's pleasure.

the next time heathcliff came my young lady chanced to be feeding some
pigeons in the court.  she had never spoken a word to her sister-in-law
for three days; but she had likewise dropped her fretful complaining, and
we found it a great comfort.  heathcliff had not the habit of bestowing a
single unnecessary civility on miss linton, i knew.  now, as soon as he
beheld her, his first precaution was to take a sweeping survey of the
house-front.  i was standing by the kitchen-window, b

impudence to embrace her.

'judas!  traitor!' i ejaculated.  'you are a hypocrite, too, are you?  a
deliberate deceiver.'

'who is, nelly?' said catherine's voice at my elbow: i had been
over-intent on watching the pair outside to mark her entrance.

'your worthless friend!' i answered, warmly: 'the sneaking rascal yonder.
ah, he has caught a glimpse of us--he is coming in!  i wonder will he
have the heart to find a plausible excuse for making love to miss, when
he told you he hated her?'

mrs. linton saw isabella tear herself free, and run into the garden; and
a minute after, heathcliff opened the door.  i couldn't withhold giving
some loose to my indignation; but catherine angrily insisted on silence,
and threatened to order me out of the kitchen, if i dared to be so
presumptuous as to put in my insolent tongue.

'to hear you, people might think you were the mistress!' she cried.  'you
want setting down in your right place!  heathcliff, what are you about,
raising this stir?  i said you mu

'god forbid that he should try!' answered the black villain.  i detested
him just then.  'god keep him meek and patient!  every day i grow madder
after sending him to heaven!'

'hush!' said catherine, shutting the inner door!  'don't vex me.  why
have you disregarded my request?  did she come across you on purpose?'

'what is it to you?' he growled.  'i have a right to kiss her, if she
chooses; and you have no right to object.  i am not _your_ husband: _you_

clear your face: you sha'n't scowl at me!  if you like isabella, you
shall marry her.  but do you like her?  tell the truth, heathcliff!
there, you won't answer.  i'm certain you don't.'

'and would mr. linton approve of his sister marrying that man?' i
inquired.

'mr. linton should approve,' returned my lady, decisively.

'he might spare himself the trouble,' said heathcliff: 'i could do as
well without his approbation. and as to you, catherine, i have a mind to
speak a few words now, while we are at it. i want you to be aware that i
_know_ you have treated me infernally--infernally! do you hear? and if
you flatter yourself that i don't perceive it, you are a fool; and if
you think i can be consoled by sweet words, you are an idiot: and if you

very little while! meantime, thank you for telling me your
sister-in-law's secret: i swear i'll make the most of it. and stand you
aside!'

'what new phase of his character is this?' exclaimed mrs. linton, in
amazement.  'i've treated you infernally--and you'll take your revenge!
how will you take it, ungrateful brute?  how have i treated you
infernally?'

'i seek no revenge on you,' replied heathcliff, less vehemently.  'that's
not the plan.  the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they don't turn
against him; they crush those beneath them.  you are welcome to torture
me to death for your amusement, only allow me to amuse myself a little in
the same style, and refrain from insult as much as you a

edgar is restored from the ill-temper he gave way to at your coming; i
begin to be secure and tranquil; and you, restless to know us at peace,
appear resolved on exciting a quarrel.  quarrel with edgar, if you
please, heathcliff, and deceive his sister: you'll hit on exactly the
most efficient method of revenging yourself on me.'

the conversation ceased.  mrs. linton sat down by the fire, flushed and
gloomy.  the spirit which served her was growing intractable: she could
neither lay nor control it.  he stood on the hearth with folded arms,
brooding on his evil thoughts; and in this position i left them to seek
the master, who was wondering what kept catherine below so long.

'ellen,' said he, when i entered, 'have you seen your mistress?'

'yes; she's in the kitchen, sir,' i answered.  'she's sadly put out by
mr. heathcliff's behaviour: and, indeed, i do th

ink it's time to arrange
his visits on another footing.  there's harm in being too soft, and now
it's come to this--.'  and i related the scene in the court, and, as near
as i dared, the whole subsequent dispute.  i fancied it could not be very
prejudicial to mrs. linton; unless she made it so afterwards, by assuming
the defensive for her guest.  edgar linton had difficulty in hearing me
to the close.  his first words revealed that he did not clear his wife of
blame.

'this is insufferable!' he exclaimed.  'it is disgraceful that she should
own him for a friend, and force his company on me!  call me two men out
of the hall, ellen.  catherine shall linger no longer to argue with the
low ruffian--i have humoured her enough.'

he descended, and bidding the servants wait in the passage, went,
followed by me, to the kitchen.  its occupants had recommence

d their
angry discussion: mrs. linton, at least, was scolding with renewed
vigour; heathcliff had moved to the window, and hung his head, somewhat
cowed by her violent rating apparently.  he saw the master first, and
made a hasty motion that she should be silent; which she obeyed,
abruptly, on discovering the reason of his intimation.

'how is this?' said linton, addressing her; 'what notion of propriety
must you have to remain here, after the language which has been held to
you by that blackguard?  i suppose, because it is his ordinary talk you
think nothing of it: you are habituated to his baseness, and, perhaps,
imagine i can get used to it too!'

'have you been listening at the door, edgar?' asked the mistress, in a
tone particularly calculated to provoke her husband, implying both
carelessness and contempt of his irritation.  heathcliff, who had r
 
 ___________________________
 
aised
his eyes at the former speech, gave a sneering laugh at the latter; on
purpose, it seemed, to draw mr. linton's attention to him.  he succeeded;
but edgar did not mean to entertain him with any high flights of passion.

'i've been so far forbearing with you, sir,' he said quietly; 'not that i
was ignorant of your miserable, degraded character, but i felt you were
only partly responsible for that; and catherine wishing to keep up your
acquaintance, i acquiesced--foolishly.  your presence is a moral poison
that would contaminate the most virtuous: for that cause, and to prevent
worse consequences, i shal

l deny you hereafter admission into this house,
and give notice now that i require your instant departure.  three
minutes' delay will render it involuntary and ignominious.

heathcliff measured the height and breadth of the speaker with an eye
full of derision.

'cathy, this lamb of yours threatens like a bull!' he said.  'it is in
danger of splitting its skull against my knuckles.  by god!  mr. linton,
i'm mortally sorry that you are not worth knocking down!'

my master glanced towards the passage, and signed me to fetch the men: he
had no intention of hazarding a personal encounter.  i obeyed the hint;
but mrs. linton, suspecting something, followed; and when i attempted to
call them, she pulled me back, slammed the door to, and locked it.

'fair means!' she said, in answer to her husband's look of angry
surprise.  'if you have not courage to attack him, make an apology, or
allow yourself t

mice.  cheer up! you sha'n't be hurt!  your type is not a lamb, it's a

'i wish you joy of the milk-blooded coward, cathy!' said her friend.  'i
compliment you on your taste.  and that is the slavering, shivering thing
you preferred to me!  i would not strike him with my fist, but i'd kick
him with my foot, and experience considerable satisfaction.  is he
weeping, or is he going to faint for fear?'

the fellow approached and gave the chair on which linton rested a push.
he'd better have kept his distance: my master quickly sprang erect, and
struck him full on the throat a blow that would have levelled a slighter
man.  it took his breath for a minute; and while he choked, mr. linton
walked out by the back door into the yard, and from thence to the front
entrance.

'there! you've done with coming here,' cried catherine.  'get away, now;
he'll return with a brace of pistols and half-a-dozen assistants.  if he
did overhear us, of course he'd never f

before i cross the threshold!  if i don't floor him now, i shall murder
him some time; so, as you value his existence, let me get at him!'

'he is not coming,' i interposed, framing a bit of a lie.  'there's the
coachman and the two gardeners; you'll surely not wait to be thrust into
the road by them!  each has a bludgeon; and master will, very likely, be
watching from the parlour-windows to see that they fulfil his orders.'

the gardeners and coachman were there: but linton was with them.  they
had already entered the court.  heathcliff, on the second thoughts,
resolved to avoid a struggle against three underlings: he seized the
poker, smashed the lock from the inner door, and made his escape as they
tramped in.

mrs. linton, who was very much excited, bade me accompany her up-stairs.
she did not know my share in contributing to the disturbance, and i was
anxious to keep her in ignorance.

'i'm nearly distracted, nelly!' she exclaimed, throwing herself on the
sofa

re after i had scolded
heathcliff till i was hoarse for him, i did not care hardly what they did
to each other; especially as i felt that, however the scene closed, we
should all be driven asunder for nobody knows how long!  well, if i
cannot keep heathcliff for my friend--if edgar will be mean and jealous,
i'll try to break their hearts by breaking my own.  that will be a prompt
way of finishing all, when i am pushed to extremity!  but it's a deed to
be reserved for a forlorn hope; i'd not take linton by surprise with it.
to this point he has been discreet in dreading to provoke me; you must
represent the peril of quitting that policy, and remind him of my
passionate temper, verging, when kindled, on frenzy.  i wish you could
dismiss that apathy out of that countenance, and look rather more anxious
about me.'

the stolidity with which i received these instructions was, no doubt,
rather exasperating: for they were delivered in perfect sincerity; but i
believed a person who could plan the turn

'oh, for mercy's sake,' interrupted the mistress, stamping her foot, 'for
mercy's sake, let us hear no more of it now!  your cold blood cannot be
worked into a fever: your veins are full of ice-water; but mine are
boiling, and the sight of such chillness makes them dance.'

'to get rid of me, answer my question,' persevered mr. linton.  'you must
answer it; and that violence does not alarm me.  i have found that you
can be as stoical as anyone, when you please.  will you give up
heathcliff hereafter, or will you give up me?  it is impossible for you
to be _my_ friend and _his_ at the same time; and i absolutely _require_
to know which you choose.'

'i require to be let alone!' exclaimed catherine, furiously.  'i demand
it!  don't you see i can scarcely stand?  edgar, you--you leave me!'

she rang the bell till it broke with

bones, at least; but she only glared about her for an instant, and then
rushed from the room. the master directed me to follow; i did, to her
chamber-door: she hindered me from going further by securing it against
me.

as she never offered to descend to breakfast next morning, i went to ask
whether she would have some carried up.  'no!' she replied, peremptorily.
the same question was repeated at dinner and tea; and again on the morrow
after, and received the same answer.  mr. linton, on his part, spent his
time in the library, and did not inquire concerning his wife's
occupations.  isabella and he had had an hour's interview, during which
he tried to elicit from her some sentiment of proper horror for
heathcliff's advances: but he could make nothing of her evasive replies,
and was obliged to close the examination unsatisfactorily; adding,
however, a solemn warning, that if she were so insane as to encourage
that worthless suitor, it would dissolve all bonds of relationship

between herself and him.




chapter xii


while miss linton moped about the park and garden, always silent, and
almost always in tears; and her brother shut himself up among books that
he never opened--wearying, i guessed, with a continual vague expectation
that catherine, repenting her conduct, would come of her own accord to
ask pardon, and seek a reconciliation--and _she_ fasted pertinaciously,
under the idea, probably, that at every meal edgar was ready to choke for
her absence, and pride alone held him from running to cast himself at her
feet; i we

 duties, convinced that the grange had but
one sensible soul in its walls, and that lodged in my body.  i wasted no
condolences on miss, nor any expostulations on my mistress; nor did i pay
much attention to the sighs of my master, who yearned to hear his lady's
name, since he might not hear her voice.  i determined they should come
about as they pleased for me; and though it was a tiresomely slow
process, i began to rejoice at length in a faint dawn of its progress: as
i thought at first.

mrs. linton, on the third day, unbarred her door, and having finished the
water in her pitcher and decanter, desired a renewed supply, and a basin
of gruel, for she believed she was dying.  that i set down as a speech
meant for edgar's ears; i believed no such thing, so i kept it to myself
and brought her some tea and dry toast.  she ate and drank eagerly, and
sank back on her pillow again, clenching her hands and groaning.  'oh, i
will die,' she exclaimed, 'since no one cares anything about me.  i wish
i

 not taken that.'  then a good while after i heard her murmur, 'no,
i'll not die--he'd be glad--he does not love me at all--he would never
miss me!'

'did you want anything, ma'am?' i inquired, still preserving my external
composure, in spite of her ghastly countenance and strange, exaggerated
manner.

'what is that apathetic being doing?' she demanded, pushing the thick
entangled locks from her wasted face.  'has he fallen into a lethargy, or
is he dead?'

'neither,' replied i; 'if you mean mr. linton.  he's tolerably well, i
think, though his studies occupy him rather more than they ought: he is
continually among his books, since he has no other society.'

i should not have spoken so if i had known her true condition, but i
could not get rid of the notion that she acted a part of her disorder.

'among his books!' she cried, confounded.  'and i dying!  i on the brink
of the grave!  my god! does he know how i'm altered?' continued she,
staring at her reflection in a mirror hanging against the

 opposite wall.
'is that catherine linton?  he imagines me in a pet--in play, perhaps.
cannot you inform him that it is frightful earnest?  nelly, if it be not
too late, as soon as i learn how he feels, i'll choose between these two:
either to starve at once--that would be no punishment unless he had a
heart--or to recover, and leave the country.  are you speaking the truth
about him now?  take care.  is he actually so utterly indifferent for my
life?'

'why, ma'am,' i answered, 'the master has no idea of your being deranged;
and of co

'you think not?  cannot you tell him i will?' she returned.  'persuade
him! speak of your own mind: say you are certain i will!'

'no, you forget, mrs. linton,' i suggested, 'that you have eaten some
food with a relish this evening, and to-morrow you will perceive its good
effects.'

'if i were only sure it would kill him,' she interrupted, 'i'd kill
myself directly!  these three awful nights i've never closed my lids--and
oh, i've been tormented!  i've been haunted, nelly!  but i begin to fancy
you don't like me.  how strange!  i thought, though everybody hated and
despised each other, they could not avoid loving me.  and they have all

pable of making her comprehend it to be
her own; so i rose and covered it with a shawl.

'it's behind there still!' she pursued, anxiously.  'and it stirred.  who
is it?  i hope it will not come out when you are gone!  oh!  nelly, the
room is haunted!  i'm afraid of being alone!'

i took her hand in mine, and bid her be composed; for a succession of
shudders convulsed her frame, and she would keep straining her gaze
towards the glass.

'there's nobody here!' i insisted.  'it was _yourself_, mrs. linton: you
knew it a while since.'

'myself!' she gasped, 'and the clock is striking twelve!  it's true,
then! that's dreadful!'

her fingers clutched the clothes, and gathered them over her eyes.  i
attempted to steal to the door with an intention of calling her husband;
but i was summoned back by a piercing shriek--the shawl had dropped from
the frame.

'why, what is the matter?' cried i.  'who is coward now?  wake up!  that
is the glass--the mirror, mrs. linton; and you see yourself in it, and

t of weeping, i lifted my hand to push the panels aside: it struck
the table-top! i swept it along the carpet, and then memory burst in: my
late anguish was swallowed in a paroxysm of despair. i cannot say why i
felt so wildly wretched: it must have been temporary derangement; for
there is scarcely cause. but, supposing at twelve years old i had been
wrenched from the heights, and every early association, and my all in
all, as heathcliff was at that time, and been converted at a stroke into
mrs. linton, the lady of thrushcross grange, and the wife of a stranger:
an exile, and outcast, thenceforth, from what had been my world. you may
fancy a glimpse of the abyss where i grovelled! shake your head as you
will, nelly, you have helped to unsettle me! you should have spoken to
edgar, indeed you should, and compelled him to leave me quiet! oh, i'm
burning! i wish i were out of doors! i wish i were a girl again, half
savage and hardy, and free; and laughing at injuries, not maddening
under them! wh

she paused, and resumed with a strange smile.  'he's considering--he'd
rather i'd come to him!  find a way, then! not through that kirkyard.  you
are slow!  be content, you always followed me!'

perceiving it vain to argue against her insanity, i was planning how i
could reach something to wrap about her, without quitting my hold of
herself (for i could not trust her alone by the gaping lattice), when, to
my consternation, i heard the rattle of the door-handle, and mr. linton
entered.  he had only then come from the library; and, in passing through
the lobby, had noticed our talking and been attracted by curiosity, or
fear, to examine what it signified, at that late hour.

'oh, sir!' i cried, checking the exclamation risen to his lips at the
sight which met him, and the bleak atmosphere of the chamber.  'my poor
mistress is ill, and she quite masters me: i cannot manage her at all;
pray, come and persuade her to go to bed.  forget your anger, for she's
hard to guide

 any way but her own.'

'catherine ill?' he said, hastening to us.  'shut the window, ellen!
catherine! why--'

he was silent.  the haggardness of mrs. linton's appearance smote him
speechless, and he could only glance from her to me in horrified
astonishment.

'she's been fretting here,' i continued, 'and eating scarcely anything,
and never complaining: she would admit none of us till this evening, and
so we couldn't inform you of her state, as we were not aware of it
ourselves; but it is nothing.'

i felt i uttered my explanations awkwardly; the master frowned.  'it is
nothing, is it, ellen dean?' he said sternly.  'you shall account more

or keeping me ignorant of this!'  and he took his wife in his
arms, and looked at her with anguish.

at first she gave him no glance of recognition: he was invisible to her
abstracted gaze.  the delirium was not fixed, however; having weaned her
eyes from contemplating the outer darkness, by degrees she centred her
attention on him, and discovered who it was that held her.

'ah! you are come, are you, edgar linton?' she said, with angry
animation.  'you are one of those things that are ever found when least
wanted, and when you are wanted, never!  i suppose we shall have plenty
of lamentations now--i see we shall--but they can't keep me from my
narrow home out yonder: my resting-place, where i'm bound before spring
is over!  there it is: not among the lintons, mind, under the
chapel-roof, but in the open air, with a head-stone; and you may please
yourself whether you go to them or come to me!'

'hush!' cried mrs. linton.  'hush, this moment!  you mention that name

wanting you.  return to your books.  i'm glad you possess a consolation,
for all you had in me is gone.'

'her mind wanders, sir,' i interposed.  'she has been talking nonsense
the whole evening; but let her have quiet, and proper attendance, and

'i desire no further advice from you,' answered mr. linton.  'you knew
your mistress's nature, and you encouraged me to harass her.  and not to
give me one hint of how she has been these three days!  it was heartless!
months of sickness could not cause such a change!'

i began to defend myself, thinking it too bad to be blamed for another's
wicked waywardness.  'i knew mrs. linton's nature to be headstrong and
domineering,' cried i: 'but i didn't know that you wished to foster her
fierce temper!  i didn't know that, to humour her, i should wink at mr.
heathcliff.  i performed the duty of a faithful servant in telling you,
and i have got a faithful servant's wages!  well, it will teach me to be
careful next time.  next time you may gather intelligence for yourself!'

'the next time you bring a tale to me you shall quit my service, ellen

confused as catherine was, her wits were alert at applying our
conversation.

'ah!  nelly has played traitor,' she exclaimed, passionately.  'nelly is
my hidden enemy.  you witch!  so you do seek elf-bolts to hurt us!  let
me go, and i'll make her rue!  i'll make her howl a recantation!'

disengage herself from linton's arms.  i felt no inclination to tarry the
event; and, resolving to seek medical aid on my own responsibility, i
quitted the chamber.

in passing the garden to reach the road, at a place where a bridle hook
is driven into the wall, i saw something white moved irregularly,
evidently by another agent than the wind.  notwithstanding my hurry, i
stayed to examine it, lest ever after i should have the conviction
impressed on my imagination that it was a creature of the other world.  my

'nelly dean,' said he, 'i can't help fancying there's an extra cause for
this.  what has there been to do at the grange?  we've odd reports up
here.  a stout, hearty lass like catherine does not fall ill for a
trifle; and that sort of people should not either.  it's hard work
bringing them through fevers, and such things.  how did it begin?'

'the master will inform you,' i answered; 'but you are acquainted with
the earnshaws' violent dispositions, and mrs. linton caps them all.  i
may say this; it commenced in a quarrel.  she was struck during a tempest
of passion with a kind of fit.  that's her account, at least: for she
flew off in the height of it, and locked herself up.  afterwards, she
refused to eat, and now she alternately raves and remains in a half
dream; knowing those about her, but having her mind filled with all sorts
of strange ideas and illusions.'

'mr. linton will be sorry?' observed kenneth, interrogatively.

consequences of neglecting my warning!  hasn't he been intimate with mr.
heathcliff lately?'

'heathcliff frequently visits at the grange,' answered i, 'though more on
the strength of the mistress having known him when a boy, than because
the master likes his company.  at present he's discharged from the
trouble of calling; owing to some presumptuous aspirations after miss
linton which he manifested.  i hardly think he'll be taken in again.'

'and does miss linton turn a cold shoulder on him?' was the doctor's next
question.

'i'm not in her confidence,' returned i, reluctant to continue the
subject.

'no, she's a sly one,' he remarked, shaking his head.  'she keeps her own
counsel!  but she's a real little fool.  i have it from good authority

of honour to be prepared on their first meeting after that: when it was

this news filled me with fresh fears; i outstripped kenneth, and ran most
of the way back.  the little dog was yelping in the garden yet.  i spared
a minute to open the gate for it, but instead of going to the house door,
it coursed up and down snuffing the grass, and would have escaped to the
road, had i not seized it and conveyed it in with me.  on ascending to

over her pillow, watching every shade and every change of her painfully

the doctor, on examining the case for himself, spoke hopefully to him of
its having a favourable termination, if we could only preserve around her
perfect and constant tranquillity.  to me, he signified the threatening
danger was not so much death, as permanent alienation of intellect.

i did not close my eyes that night, nor did mr. linton: indeed, we never
went to bed; and the servants were all up long before the usual hour,
moving through the house with stealthy tread, and exchanging whispers as
they encountered each other in their vocations.  every one was active but
miss isabella; and they began to remark how sound she slept: her brother,
too, asked if she had risen, and seemed impatient for her presence, and
hurt that she showed so little anxiety for her sister-in-law.  i trembled
lest he should send me to call her; but i wa

s spared the pain of being
the first proclaimant of her flight.  one of the maids, a thoughtless
girl, who had been on an early errand to gimmerton, came panting
up-stairs, open-mouthed, and dashed into the chamber, crying: 'oh, dear,
dear!  what mun we have next?  master, master, our young lady--'

'hold your noise!' cried, i hastily, enraged at her clamorous manner.

'speak lower, mary--what is the matter?' said mr. linton.  'what ails
your young lady?'

'she's gone, she's gone!  yon' heathcliff's run off wi' her!' gasped the
girl.

'that is not true!' exclaimed linton, rising in agitation.  'it cannot
be: how has the idea entered your head?  ellen dean, go and seek her.  it
is incredible: it cannot be.'

as he spoke he took the servant to the door, and then repeated his demand
to know her reasons for such an assertion.

'why, i met on the road a lad that fetches milk here,' she stammered,
'and he asked whether w

a cloak about her face; but having desired a sup of water, while she
drank it fell back, and she saw her very plain.  heathcliff held both
bridles as they rode on, and they set their faces from the village, and
went as fast as the rough roads would let them.  the lass said nothing to
her father, but she told it all over gimmerton this morning.'

i ran and peeped, for form's sake, into isabella's room; confirming, when
i returned, the servant's statement.  mr. linton had resumed his seat by
the bed; on my re-entrance, he raised his eyes, read the meaning of my
blank aspect, and dropped them without giving an order, or uttering a
word.

'are we to try any measures for overtaking and bringing her back,' i
inquired.  'how should we do?'

'she went of her own accord,' answered the master; 'she had a right to go
if she pleased.  trouble me no more about her.  hereafter she is only my
sister in name: not because i disown her, but because she has disowned
me.'

sacrificed to preserve a mere ruin of humanity--he knew no limits in
gratitude and joy when catherine's life was declared out of danger; and
hour after hour he would sit beside her, tracing the gradual return to
bodily health, and flattering his too sanguine hopes with the illusion
that her mind would settle back to its right balance also, and she would
soon be entirely her former self.

the first time she left her chamber was at the commencement of the
following march.  mr. linton had put on her pillow, in the morning, a
handful of golden crocuses; her eye, long stranger to any gleam of
pleasure, caught them in waking, and shone delighted as she gathered them
eagerly together.

'these are the earliest flowers at the heights,' she exclaimed.  'they
remind me of soft thaw winds, and warm sunshine, and nearly melted snow.

'the snow is quite gone down here, darling,' replied her husband; 'and i

another room could be prepared.  to obviate the fatigue of mounting and
descending the stairs, we fitted up this, where you lie at present--on
the same floor with the parlour; and she was soon strong enough to move
from one to the other, leaning on edgar's arm.  ah, i thought myself, she
might recover, so waited on as she was.  and there was double cause to
desire it, for on her existence depended that of another: we cherished
the hope that in a little while mr. linton's heart would be gladdened,
and his lands secured from a stranger's grip, by the birth of an heir.

i should mention that isabella sent to her brother, some six weeks from
her departure, a short note, announcing her marriage with heathcliff.  it
appeared dry and cold; but at the bottom was dotted in with pencil an
obscure apology, and an entreaty for kind remembrance and reconciliation,
if her proceeding had offended him: asserting that she could not help it

reply to this, i believe; and, in a fortnight more, i got a long letter,
which i considered odd, coming from the pen of a bride just out of the
honeymoon.  i'll read it: for i keep it yet.  any relic of the dead is
precious, if they were valued living.

i took the liberty of knocking, in hopes some more civil servant might
show himself.  after a short suspense, it was opened by a tall, gaunt
man, without neckerchief, and otherwise extremely slovenly; his features
were lost in masses of shaggy hair that hung on his shoulders; and _his_
eyes, too, were like a ghostly catherine's with all their beauty
annihilated.

'what's your business here?' he demanded, grimly.  'who are you?'

'my name was isabella linton,' i replied.  'you've seen me before, sir.
i'm lately married to mr. heathcliff, and he has brought me here--i
suppose, by your permission.'

'is he come back, then?' asked the hermit, glaring like a hungry wolf.

'yes--we came just now,' i said; 'but he left me by the kitchen door; and
when i would have gone in, your little boy played sentinel over the
place, and frightened me off by the help of a bull-dog.'

'it's well the hellish villain has kept his word!' growled my future
host, searching

could get hold of him.

day--don't disappoint me!--isabella.




chapter xiv


as soon as i had perused this epistle i went to the master, and informed
him that his sister had arrived at the heights, and sent me a letter
expressing her sorrow for mrs. linton's situation, and her ardent desire
to see him; with a wish that he would transmit to her, as early as
possible, some token of forgiveness by me.

'forgiveness!' said linton.  'i have nothing to forgive her, ellen.  you
may call at wuthering heights this afternoon, if you like, and say that i
am not angry, but i'm sorry to have lost her; especially as i can never
think she'll be happy.  it is out of the question my going to see her,
however: we are eternally divided; and should she really wish t

unication, as nothing could come of
keeping it up.'

mrs. heathcliff's lip quivered slightly, and she returned to her seat in
the window.  her husband took his stand on the hearthstone, near me, and
began to put questions concerning catherine.  i told him as much as i
thought proper of her illness, and he extorted from me, by
cross-examination, most of the facts connected with its origin.  i blamed
her, as she deserved, for bringing it all on herself; and ended by hoping
that he would follow mr. linton's example and avoid future interference
with his family, for good or evil.

'mrs. linton is now just recovering,' i said; 'she'll never be like she
was, but her life is spared; and if you really have a regard for her,
you'll shun crossing her way again: nay, you'll move out of this country
entirely; and that you may not regret it, i'll inform you catherine
linton is as different now from your old friend catherine earnshaw, as
that young lady is different from me.  her appearance is changed grea

have died by inches before i touched a single hair of his head!'

'and yet,' i interrupted, 'you have no scruples in completely ruining all
hopes of her perfect restoration, by thrusting yourself into her
remembrance now, when she has nearly forgotten you, and involving her in
a new tumult of discord and distress.'

'you suppose she has nearly forgotten me?' he said.  'oh, nelly! you know
she has not!  you know as well as i do, that for every thought she spends
on linton she spends a thousand on me!  at a most miserable period of my
life, i had a notion of the kind: it haunted me on my return to the
neighbourhood last summer; but only her own assurance could make me admit
the horrible idea again.  and then, linton would be nothing, nor hindley,
nor all the dreams that ever i dreamt.  two words would comprehend my
future--_death_ and _hell_: existence, after losing her, would be hell.
yet i was a fool to fancy for a moment that she valued edgar linton's

he hanging of every being belonging to her, except one:
possibly she took that exception for herself.  but no brutality disgusted
her: i suppose she has an innate admiration of it, if only her precious
person were secure from injury!  now, was it not the depth of
absurdity--of genuine idiotcy, for that pitiful, slavish, mean-minded
brach to dream that i could love her?  tell your master, nelly, that i
never, in all my life, met with such an abject thing as she is.  she even
disgraces the name of linton; and i've sometimes relented, from pure lack
of invention, in my experiments on what she could endure, and still creep
shamefully cringing back!  but tell him, also, to set his fraternal and
magisterial heart at ease: that i keep strictly within the limits of the
law.  i have avoided, up to this period, giving her the slightest right
to claim a separation; and, what's more, she'd thank nobody for dividing
us.  if she desired to go, she might: the nuisance of her presence
outweighs the gratifica

the increase of pain.'

'do you understand what the word pity means?' i said, hastening to resume
my bonnet.  'did you ever feel a touch of it in your life?'

'put that down!' he interrupted, perceiving my intention to depart.  'you
are not going yet.  come here now, nelly: i must either persuade or
compel you to aid me in fulfilling my determination to see catherine, and
that without delay.  i swear that i meditate no harm: i don't desire to
cause any disturbance, or to exasperate or insult mr. linton; i only wish
to hear from herself how she is, and why she has been ill; and to ask if
anything that i could do would be of use to her.  last night i was in the
grange garden six hours, and i'll return there to-night; and every night
i'll haunt the place, and every day, till i find an opportunity of
entering.  if edgar linton meets me, i shall not hesitate to knock him
down, and give him enough to insure his quiescence while i stay.  if his
servants oppose me, i shall threaten them off with thes

well, mr. lockwood, i argued and complained, and flatly refused him fifty
times; but in the long run he forced me to an agreement.  i engaged to
carry a letter from him to my mistress; and should she consent, i
promised to let him have intelligence of linton's next absence from home,
when he might come, and get in as he was able: i wouldn't be there, and
my fellow-servants should be equally out of the way.  was it right or
wrong?  i fear it was wrong, though expedient.  i thought i prevented
another explosion by my compliance; and i thought, too, it might create a
favourable crisis in catherine's mental illness: and then i remembered
mr. edgar's stern rebuke of my carrying tales; and i tried to smooth away
all disquietude on the subject, by affirmi

that that betrayal of trust, if it merited so harsh an appellation,

myself to put the missive into mrs. linton's hand.

morning.

doctor: and not exactly of the kind which i should have chosen to amuse
me.  but never mind!  i'll extract wholesome medicines from mrs. dean's
bitter herbs; and firstly, let me beware of the fascination that lurks in
catherine heathcliff's brilliant eyes.  i sho

were gone to church.  there was
a manservant left to keep the house with me, and we generally made a
practice of locking the doors during the hours of service; but on that
occasion the weather was so warm and pleasant that i set them wide open,
and, to fulfil my engagement, as i knew who would be coming, i told my
companion that the mistress wished very much for some oranges, and he
must run over to the village and get a few, to be paid for on the morrow.
he departed, and i went up-stairs.

mrs. linton sat in a loose white dress, with a light shawl over her
shoulders, in the recess of the open window, as usual.  her thick, long
hair had been partly removed at the beginning of her illness, and now she
wore it simply combed in its natural tresses over her temples and neck.
her appearance was altered, as i had told heathcliff; but when she was
calm, there seemed unearthly beauty in the change.  the flash of her eyes
had been succeeded by a dreamy and melancholy softness; they no longer
gave the

ts haggard aspect having
vanished as she recovered flesh--and the peculiar expression arising from
her mental state, though painfully suggestive of their causes, added to
the touching interest which she awakened; and--invariably to me, i know,
and to any person who saw her, i should think--refuted more tangible
proofs of convalescence, and stamped her as one doomed to decay.

a book lay spread on the sill before her, and the scarcely perceptible
wind fluttered its leaves at intervals.  i believe linton had laid it
there: for she never endeavoured to divert herself with reading, or
occupation of any kind, and he would spend many an hour in trying to
entice her attention to some subject which had formerly been her
amusement.  she was conscious of his aim, and in her better moods endured
his efforts placidly, only showing their uselessness by now and then
suppressing a wearied sigh, and checking him at last with the saddest of
smiles and kisses.  at other times, she would turn petulantly away, a

tute for the yet absent murmur of the summer foliage, which drowned
that music about the grange when the trees were in leaf.  at wuthering
heights it always sounded on quiet days following a great thaw or a
season of steady rain.  and of wuthering heights catherine was thinking
as she listened: that is, if she thought or listened at all; but she had
the vague, distant look i mentioned before, which expressed no
recognition of material things either by ear or eye.

'there's a letter for you, mrs. linton,' i said, gently inserting it in
one hand that rested on her knee.  'you must read it immediately, because
it wants an answer.  shall i break the seal?'  'yes,' she answered,
without altering the direction of her eyes.  i opened it--it was very
short.  'now,' i continued, 'read it.'  she drew away her hand, and let
it fall.  i replaced it in her lap, and stood waiting till it should
please her to glance down; but that movement was so long delayed that at
last i resumed--'must i read it, ma'am?

hear her reply, she merely
pointed to the name, and gazed at me with mournful and questioning
eagerness.

'well, he wishes to see you,' said i, guessing her need of an
interpreter.  'he's in the garden by this time, and impatient to know
what answer i shall bring.'

as i spoke, i observed a large dog lying on the sunny grass beneath raise
its ears as if about to bark, and then smoothing them back, announce, by
a wag of the tail, that some one approached whom it did not consider a
stranger.  mrs. linton bent forward, and listened breathlessly.  the
minute after a step traversed the hall; the open house was too tempting
for heathcliff to resist walking in: most likely he supposed that i was
inclined to shirk my promise, and so resolved to trust to his own
audacity.  with straining eagerness catherine gazed towards the entrance
of her chamber.  he did not hit the right room directly: she motioned me
to admit him, but he found it out ere i could reach the door, and in a
stride or two was at her s

her; while
he, in return, covering her with frantic caresses, said wildly--

'you teach me now how cruel you've been--cruel and false.  _why_ did you
despise me?  _why_ did you betray your own heart, cathy?  i have not one
word of comfort.  you deserve this.  you have killed yourself.  yes, you
may kiss me, and cry; and wring out my kisses and tears: they'll blight
you--they'll damn you.  you loved me--then what _right_ had you to leave
me?  what right--answer me--for the poor fancy you felt for linton?
because misery and degradation, and death, and nothing that god or satan
could inflict would have parted us, _you_, of your own will, did it.  i
have not broken your heart--_you_ have broken it; and in breaking it, you
have broken mine.  so much the worse for me that i am strong.  do i want
to live?  what kind of living will it be when you--oh, god! would _you_
like to live with your soul in the grave?'

'let me alone.  let me alone,' sobbed catherine.  'if i've done wrong,
i'm dying for it.

grew very uncomfortable, meanwhile; for the afternoon wore fast away,
the man whom i had sent off returned from his errand, and i could
distinguish, by the shine of the western sun up the valley, a concourse
thickening outside gimmerton chapel porch.

'service is over,' i announced.  'my master will be here in half an
hour.'

heathcliff groaned a curse, and strained catherine closer: she never
moved.

ere long i perceived a group of the servants passing up the road towards
the kitchen wing.  mr. linton was not far behind; he opened the gate
himself and sauntered slowly up, probably enjoying the lovely afternoon
that breathed as soft as summer.

'now he is here,' i exclaimed.  'for heaven's sake, hurry down!  you'll
not meet any one on the front stairs.  do be quick; and stay among the
trees till he is fairly in.'

'i must go, cathy,' said heathcliff, seeking to extricate himself from
his companion's arms.  'but if i live, i'll see you again before you are
asleep.  i won't stray five yards fro

 a blessing on my lips.'

and there they were fast again.  i heard my master mounting the
stairs--the cold sweat ran from my forehead: i was horrified.

'are you going to listen to her ravings?' i said, passionately.  'she
does not know what she says.  will you ruin her, because she has not wit
to help herself?  get up!  you could be free instantly.  that is the most
diabolical deed that ever you did.  we are all done for--master,
mistress, and servant.'

i wrung my hands, and cried out; and mr. linton hastened his step at the
noise.  in the midst of my agitation, i was sincerely glad to observe
that catherine's arms had fallen relaxed, and her head hung down.

'she's fainted, or dead,' i thought: 'so much the better.  far better
that she should be dead, than lingering a burden and a misery-maker to
all about her.'

edgar sprang to his unbidden guest, blanched with astonishment and rage.
what he meant to do i cannot tell; however, the other stopped all
demonstrations, at once, by placing the

lifeless-looking form in his
arms.

'look there!' he said.  'unless you be a fiend, help her first--then you
shall speak to me!'

he walked into the parlour, and sat down.  mr. linton summoned me, and
with great difficulty, and after resorting to many means, we managed to
restore her to sensation; but she was all bewildered; she sighed, and
moaned, and knew nobody.  edgar, in his anxiety for her, forgot her hated
friend.  i did not.  i went, at the earliest opportunity, and besought
him to depart; affirming that catherine was better, and he should hear
from me in the morning how she passed the night.

'i shall not refuse to go out of doors,' he answered; 'but i shall stay
in
 
 ___________________________
 
 the garden: and, nelly, mind you keep your word to-morrow.  i shall be
under those larch-trees.  mind! or i pay another visit, whether linton be
in or not.'

he sent a rapid glance through the half-open door of the chamber, and,
ascertaining that what i stated was apparently true, delivered the house
of his luckless presence.




chapter xvi


about twelve o'clock that night was born the catherine you saw at
wuthering heights: a puny, seven-months' child; and two hours after the
mother died, having never recovered sufficient consciousness to miss
heathcliff, or know edgar.  the latter's distraction at his bereavement
is a subject too

 painful to be dwelt on; its after-effects showed how
deep the sorrow sunk.  a great addition, in my eyes, was his being left
without an heir.  i bemoaned that, as i gazed on the feeble orphan; and i
mentally abused old linton for (what was only natural partiality) the
securing his estate to his own daughter, instead of his son's.  an
unwelcomed infant it was, poor thing!  it might have wailed out of life,
and nobody cared a morsel, during those first hours of existence.  we
redeemed the neglect afterwards; but its beginning was as friendless as
its end is likely to be.

pillow, and his eyes shut.  his young and fair features were almost as
deathlike as those of the form beside him, and almost as fixed: but _his_
was the hush of exhausted anguish, and _hers_ of perfect peace.  her brow
smooth, her lids closed, her lips wearing the expression of a smile; no
angel in heaven could be more beautiful than she appeared.  and i partook
of the infinite calm in which she lay: my mind was never in a holier
frame than while i gazed on that untroub

now if it be a peculiarity in me, but i am seldom otherwise than
happy while watching in the chamber of death, should no frenzied or
despairing mourner share the duty with me.  i see a repose that neither
earth nor hell can break, and i feel an assurance of the endless and
shadowless hereafter--the eternity they have entered--where life is
boundless in its duration, and love in its sympathy, and joy in its
fulness.  i noticed on that occasion how much selfishness there is even
in a love like mr. linton's, when he so regretted catherine's blessed
release!  to be sure, one might have doubted, after the wayward and
impatient existence she had led, whether she merited a haven of peace at
last.  one might doubt in seasons of cold reflection; but not then, in
the presence of her corpse.  it asserted its own tranquillity, which
seemed a pledge of equal quiet to its former inhabitant.

mrs. dean's question, which struck me as something
heterodox.  she proceeded:

retracing the course of catherine linton, i fear we have no right to
think she is; but we'll leave her with her maker.

the master looked asleep, and i ventured soon after sunrise to quit the
room and steal out to the pure refreshing air.  the servants thought me
gone to shake off the drowsiness of my protracted watch; in reality, my
chief motive was seeing mr. heathcliff.  if he had remained among the
larches all night, he would have heard nothing of the stir at the grange;
unless, perhaps, he might catch the gallop of the messenger

bark of the tree, and his hand and forehead were both stained; probably
the scene i witnessed was a repetition of others acted during the night.
it hardly moved my compassion--it appalled me: still, i felt reluctant to
quit him so.  but the moment he recollected himself enough to notice me
watching, he thundered a command for me to go, and i obeyed.  he was
beyond my skill to quiet or console!

mrs. linton's funeral was appointed to take place on the friday following
her decease; and till then her coffin remained uncovered, and strewn with
flowers and scented leaves, in the great drawing-room.  linton spent his
days and nights there, a sleepless guardian; and--a circumstance
concealed from all but me--heathcliff spent his nights, at least,
outside, equally a stranger to repose.  i held no communication with him:
still, i was conscious of his design to enter, if he could; and on the

to the grave; he sent no excuse, but he never came; so that, besides her
husband, the mourners were wholly composed of tenants and servants.
isabella was not asked.

the place of catherine's interment, to the surprise of the villagers, was
neither in the chapel under the carved monument of the lintons, nor yet
by the tombs of her own relations, outside.  it was dug on a green slope
in a corner of the kirk-yard, where the wall is so low that heath and
bilberry-plants have climbed over it from the moor; and peat-mould almost
buries it.  her husband lies in the same spot now; and they have each a
simple headstone above, and a plain grey block at their feet, to mark the
graves.

nothing: in fact, i was as reckless as some malefactors show themselves

'he shook me till my teeth rattled, and pitched me beside joseph, who
steadily concluded his supplications, and then rose, vowing he would set
off for the grange directly.  mr. linton was a magistrate, and though he
had fifty wives dead, he should inquire into this.  he was so obstinate
in his resolution, that heathcliff deemed it expedient to compel from my
lips a recapitulation of what had taken place; standing over me, heaving
with malevolence, as i reluctantly delivered the account in answer to his
questions.  it required a great deal of labour to satisfy the old man
that heathcliff was not the aggressor; especially with my hardly-wrung
replies.  however, mr. earnshaw so

pped on to a chair, kissed edgar's and catherine's portraits, bestowed
a similar salute on me, and descended to the carriage, accompanied by
fanny, who yelped wild with joy at recovering her mistress.  she was
driven away, never to revisit this neighbourhood: but a regular
correspondence was established between her and my master when things were
more settled.  i believe her new abode was in the south, near london;
there she had a son born a few months subsequent to her escape.  he was
christened linton, and, from the first, she reported him to be an ailing,
peevish creature.

mr. heathcliff, meeting me one day in the village, inquired where she
lived.  i refused to tell.  he remarked that it was not of any moment,
only she must beware of coming to her brother: she should not be with
him, if he had to keep her himself.  though i would give no information,
he discovered, through some of the other servants, both her place of
residence and the existence of the child.  still, he didn't molest her:

for which forbearance she might thank his aversion, i suppose.  he often
asked about the infant, when he saw me; and on hearing its name, smiled
grimly, and observed: 'they wish me to hate it too, do they?'

'i don't think they wish you to know anything about it,' i answered.

'but i'll have it,' he said, 'when i want it.  they may reckon on that!'

fortunately its mother died before the time arrived; some thirteen years
after the decease of catherine, when linton was twelve, or a little more.

on the day succeeding isabella's unexpected visit i had no opportunity of
speaking to my master: he shunned conversation, and was fit for
discussing nothing.  when i could get him to listen, i saw it pleased him
that his sister had left her husband; whom he abhorred with an intensity
which the mildness of his nature would scarcely seem to allow.  so deep
and sensitive was his aversion, that he refrained from going anywhere
where he was likely to see or hear of hea

similar circumstances.  they had both been fond husbands, and were both
attached to their children; and i could not see how they shouldn't both
have taken the same road, for good or evil.  but, i thought in my mind,
hindley, with apparently the stronger head, has shown himself sadly the
worse and the weaker man.  when his ship struck, the captain abandoned
his post; and the crew, instead of trying to save her, rushed into riot
and confusion, leaving no hope for their luckless vessel.  linton, on the
contrary, displayed the true courage of a loyal and faithful soul: he
trusted god; and god comforted him.  one hoped, and the other despaired:
they chose their own lots, and were righteously doomed to endure them.
but you'll not want to hear my moralising, mr. lockwood; you'll judge, as
well as i can, all these things: at least, you'll think you will, and
that's the same.  the end of earnshaw was what might have been expected;

drunk as a lord.  poor lad!  i'm sorry, too.  one can't help missing an
old companion: though he had the worst tricks with him that ever man
imagined, and has done me many a rascally turn.  he's barely
twenty-seven, it seems; that's your own age: who would have thought you
were born in one year?'

i confess this blow was greater to me than the shock of mrs. linton's
death: ancient associations lingered round my heart; i sat down in the
porch and wept as for a blood relation, desiring mr. kenneth to get
another servant to introduce him to the master.  i could not hinder
myself from pondering on the question--'had he had fair play?'  whatever
i did, that idea would bother me: it was so tiresomely pertinacious that
i resolved on requesting leave to go to wuthering heights, and assist in
the last duties to the dead.  mr. linton was extremely reluctant to

the table and muttered, with peculiar gusto, 'now, my bonny lad, you are
_mine_!  and we'll see if one tree won't grow as crooked as another, with
the same wind to twist it!'  the unsuspecting thing was pleased at this
speech: he played with heathcliff's whiskers, and stroked his cheek; but
i divined its meaning, and observed tartly, 'that boy must go back with
me to thrushcross grange, sir.  there is nothing in the world less yours
than he is!'

'does linton say so?' he demanded.

'of course--he has ordered me to take him,' i replied.

'well,' said the scoundrel, 'we'll not argue the subject now: but i have
a fancy to try my hand at rearing a young one; so intimate to your master
that i must supply the place of this with my own, if he attempt to remove
it.  i don't engage to let hareton go undisputed; but i'll be pretty sure
to make the other come!  remember to tell him.'

the guest was now the master of wuthering heights: he held firm
possession, and proved to the attorney--who, in his turn, proved it to
mr. linton--that earnshaw had mortgaged every yard of land he owned for
cash to supply his mania for gaming; and he, heathcliff, was the
mortgagee.  in that manner hareton, who should now be the first gentleman
in the neighbourhood, was reduced to a state of complete dependence on
his father's inveterate enemy; and lives in his own house as a servant,
deprived of the advantage of wages: quite unable to right himself,
because of his friendlessness, and his ignorance that he has been
wronged.

the twelve years, continued mrs. dean, following that dismal period were
the happiest of my life: my greatest troubles in their passage rose from
our little lady's trifling illnesses, which she had to experience in
common with all children, rich and poor.  for the rest, after the first
six months, she grew like a larch, and could walk and talk too, in her
own way, before the heath blossomed a second time over mrs. linton's
dust.  she was the most winning thing that ever brought sunshine into a
desolate house: a real beauty in face, with the earnshaws' handsome dark
eyes, but the lintons' fair skin and small features, and yellow curling
hair.  her spirit was high, though not rough, and qualified by a heart
sensitive and lively to excess in its affections.  that capacity for
intense attachments reminded me of her mother: still she did not resemble
her: for she could be soft and mild as a dove, and she had a gentl

er, it was
always--'i shall tell papa!'  and if he reproved her, even by a look, you
would have thought it a heart-breaking business: i don't believe he ever
did speak a harsh word to her.  he took her education entirely on
himself, and made it an amusement.  fortunately, curiosity and a quick
intellect made her an apt scholar: she learned rapidly and eagerly, and
did honour to his teaching.

till she reached the age of thirteen she had not once been beyond the
range of the park by herself.  mr. linton would take her with him a mile
or so outside, on rare occasions; but he trusted her to no one else.
gimmerton was an unsubstantial name in her ears; the chapel, the only
building she had approached or entered, except her own home.  wuthering
heights and mr. heathcliff did not exist for her: she was a perfect
recluse; and, apparently, perfectly contented.  sometimes, indeed, while
surveying the country from her nursery window, she would observe--

'ellen, how long will it be before i can walk to

,' i answered, hastily, 'that they are not
worth the trouble of visiting.  the moors, where you ramble with him, are
much nicer; and thrushcross park is the finest place in the world.'

'but i know the park, and i don't know those,' she murmured to herself.
'and i should delight to look round me from the brow of that tallest
point: my little pony minny shall take me some time.'

one of the maids mentioning the fairy cave, quite turned her head with a
desire to fulfil this project: she teased mr. linton about it; and he
promised she should have the journey when she got older.  but miss
catherine measured her age by months, and, 'now, am i old enough to go to
penistone crags?' was the constant question in her mouth.  the road
thither wound close by wuthering heights.  edgar had not the heart to
pass it; so she received as constantly the answer, 'not yet, love: not
yet.'

i said mrs. heathcliff lived above a dozen years after quitting her
husband.  her family were of a delicate constitution: she

her last illness was, i am not certain: i conjecture, they died of the
same thing, a kind of fever, slow at its commencement, but incurable, and
rapidly consuming life towards the close.  she wrote to inform her
brother of the probable conclusion of a four-months' indisposition under
which she had suffered, and entreated him to come to her, if possible;
for she had much to settle, and she wished to bid him adieu, and deliver
linton safely into his hands.  her hope was that linton might be left
with him, as he had been with her: his father, she would fain convince
herself, had no desire to assume the burden of his maintenance or
education.  my master hesitated not a moment in complying with her
request: reluctant as he was to leave home at ordinary calls, he flew to
answer this; commanding catherine to my peculiar vigilance, in his
absence, with reiterated orders that she must not wander out of the park,
even under my escort he did not calculate on her going unaccompanie

'aha, ellen!' she cried, gaily, jumping up and running to my side.  'i

have you ever been here in your life before?'

'put that hat on, and home at once,' said i.  'i'm dreadfully grieved at
you, miss cathy: you've done extremely wrong!  it's no use pouting and
crying: that won't repay the trouble i've had, scouring the country after
you.  to think how mr. linton charged me to keep you in; and you stealing
off so!  it shows you are a cunning little fox, and nobody will put faith
in you any more.'

'what have i done?' sobbed she, instantly checked.  'papa charged me
nothing: he'll not scold me, ellen--he's never cross, like you!'

'come, come!' i repeated.  'i'll tie the riband.  now, let us have no
petulance.  oh, for shame!  you thirteen years old, and such a baby!'

this exclamation was caused by her pushing the hat from her head, and
retreating to th

bare notion of relationship with such a clown.

'hush, hush!' i whispered; 'people can have many cousins and of all
sorts, miss cathy, without being any the worse for it; only they needn't
keep their company, if they be disagreeable and bad.'

'he's not--he's not my cousin, ellen!' she went on, gathering fresh grief
from reflection, and flinging herself into my arms for refuge from the
idea.

i was much vexed at her and the servant for their mutual revelations;
having no doubt of linton's approaching arrival, communicated by the
former, being reported to mr. heathcliff; and feeling as confident that
catherine's first thought on her father's return would be to seek an
explanation of the latter's assertion concerning her rude-bred kindred.
hareton, recovering from his disgust at being taken for a servant, seemed
moved by her distress; and, having fetched the pony round to the door, he
took, to propitiate her, a fine crooked-legged terrier whelp from the
kennel, and putting it in

i refused staunchly.  at length her suspense was ended: the travelling
carriage rolled in sight.  miss cathy shrieked and stretched out her arms
as soon as she caught her father's face looking from the window.  he
descended, nearly as eager as herself; and a considerable interval
elapsed ere they had a thought to spare for any but themselves.  while
they exchanged caresses i took a peep in to see after linton.  he was
asleep in a corner, wrapped in a warm, fur-lined cloak, as if it had been
winter.  a pale, delicate, effeminate boy, who might have been taken for
my master's younger brother, so strong was the resemblance: but there was
a sickly peevishness in his aspect that edgar linton never had.  the
latter saw me looking; and having shaken hands, advised me to close the
door, and leave him undisturbed; for the journey had fatigued him.  cathy
would fain have taken one glance, but her father told

her to come, and
they walked together up the park, while i hastened before to prepare the
servants.

'now, darling,' said mr. linton, addressing his daughter, as they halted
at the bottom of the front steps: 'your cousin is not so strong or so
merry as you are, and he has lost his mother, remember, a very short time
since; therefore, don't expect him to play and run about with you
directly.  and don't harass him much by talking: let him be quiet this
evening, at least, will you?'

'yes, yes, papa,' answered catherine: 'but i do want to see him; and he
hasn't once looked out.'

the carriage stopped; and the sleeper being rous

ground by his uncle.

'this is your cousin cathy, linton,' he said, putting their little hands
together.  'she's fond of you already; and mind you don't grieve her by
crying to-night.  try to be cheerful now; the travelling is at an end,
and you have nothing to do but rest and amuse yourself as you please.'

'let me go to bed, then,' answered the boy, shrinking from catherine's
salute; and he put his fingers to remove incipient tears.

'come, come, there's a good child,' i whispered, leading him in.  'you'll

i do not know whether it was sorrow for him, but his cousin put on as sad
a countenance as himself, and returned to her father.  all three entered,
and mounted to the library, where tea was laid ready.  i proceeded to
remove linton's cap and mantle, and placed him on a chair by the table;
but he was no sooner seated than he began to cry afresh.  my master
inquired what was the matter.

'i can't sit on a chair,' sobbed the boy.

uncle patiently.

s own age will instil new spirit into him soon, and by wishing for
strength he'll gain it.'

'ay, if we can keep him!' i mused to myself; and sore misgivings came
over me that there was slight hope of that.  and then, i thought, how
ever will that weakling live at wuthering heights?  between his father
and hareton, what playmates and instructors they'll be.  our doubts were
presently decided--even earlier than i expected.  i had just taken the
children up-stairs, after tea was finished, and seen linton asleep--he
would not suffer me to leave him till that was the case--i had come down,
and was standing by the table in the hall, lighting a bedroom candle for
mr. edgar, when a maid stepped out of the kitchen and informed me that
mr. heathcliff's servant joseph was at the door, and wished to speak with
the master.

'i shall ask him what he wants first,' i said, in considerable
trepidation.  'a very unlikely hour to be troubling people, and the
instant they have returned from a long journey.  i d

joseph had advanced through the kitchen as i uttered these words, and now
presented himself in the hall.  he was donned in his sunday garments,
with his most sanctimonious and sourest face, and, holding his hat in one
hand, and his stick in the other, he proceeded to clean his shoes on the
mat.

'good-evening, joseph,' i said, coldly.  'what business brings you here
to-night?'

'it's maister linton i mun spake to,' he answered, waving me disdainfully
aside.

'mr. linton is going to bed; unless you have something particular to say,
i'm sure he won't hear it now,' i continued.  'you had better sit down in
there, and entrust your message to me.'

'which is his rahm?' pursued the fellow, surveying the range of closed
doors.

i perceived he was bent on refusing my mediation, so very reluctantly i

ed till next day.  mr. linton had no time to
empower me to do so, for joseph mounted close at my heels, and, pushing
into the apartment, planted himself at the far side of the table, with
his two fists clapped on the head of his stick, and began in an elevated
tone, as if anticipating opposition--

'hathecliff has sent me for his lad, and i munn't goa back 'bout him.'

edgar linton was silent a minute; an expression of exceeding sorrow
overcast his features: he would have pitied the child on his own account;
but, recalling isabella's hopes and fears, and anxious wishes for her
son, and her commendations of him to his care, he grieved bitterly at the
prospect of yielding him up, and searched in his heart how it might be
avoided.  no plan offered itself: the very exhibition of any desire to
keep him would have rendered the claimant more peremptory: there was
nothing left bu

t to resign him.  however, he was not going to rouse him
from his sleep.

'tell mr. heathcliff,' he answered calmly, 'that his son shall come to
wuthering heights to-morrow.  he is in bed, and too tired to go the
distance now.  you may also tell him that the mother of linton desired
him to remain under my guardianship; and, at present, his health is very
precarious.'

'noa!' said joseph, giving a thud with his prop on the floor, and
assuming an authoritative air.  'noa! that means naught.  hathecliff maks
noa 'count o' t' mother, nor ye norther; but he'll heu' his lad; und i

to obviate the danger of this threat being fulfilled, mr. linton
commissioned me to take the boy home early, on catherine's pony; and,
said he--'as we shall now have no influence over his destiny, good or
bad, you must say nothing of where he is gone to my daughter: she cannot
associate with him hereafter, and it is better for her to remain in
ignorance of his proximity; lest she should be restless, and anxious to
visit the heights.  merely tell her his father sent for him suddenly, and
he has been obliged to leave us.'

linton was very reluctant to be rouse

 he should recover from his late
journey.

'my father!' he cried, in strange perplexity.  'mamma never told me i had
a father.  where does he live?  i'd rather stay with uncle.'

'he lives a little distance from the grange,' i replied; 'just beyond
those hills: not so far, but you may walk over here when you get hearty.
and you should be glad to go home, and to see him.  you must try to love
him, as you did your mother, and then he will love you.'

'but why have i not heard of him before?' asked linton.  'why didn't
mamma and he live together, as other people do?'

'he had business to keep him in the north,' i answered, 'and your
mother's health required her to reside in the south.'

'and why didn't mamma speak to me about him?' persevered the child.  'she
often talked of uncle, and i learnt to love him long ago.  how am i to
love papa?  i don't know him.'

'oh, all children love their parents,' i said.  'your mother, perhaps,
thought you would want to be with him if she mentioned him often t

you in a walk: he does, frequently,
walk out on the hills.'

'and what is my father like?' he asked.  'is he as young and handsome as
uncle?'

'he's as young,' said i; 'but he has black hair and eyes, and looks
sterner; and he is taller and bigger altogether.  he'll not seem to you
so gentle and kind at first, perhaps, because it is not his way: still,
mind you, be frank and cordial with him; and naturally he'll be fonder of
you than any uncle, for you are his own.'

'black hair and eyes!' mused linton.  'i can't fancy him.  then i am not
like him, am i?'

'not much,' i answered: not a morsel, i thought, surveying with regret
the white complexion and slim frame of my companion, and his large
languid eyes--his mother's eyes, save that, unless a morbid touchiness
kindled them a moment, they had not a vestige of her sparkling spirit.

'how strange that he should never come to see mamma and me!' he murmured.
'has he ever seen me?  if he has, i must have been a baby.  i remember
not a single thing

 about him!'

'why, master linton,' said i, 'three hundred miles is a great distance;
and ten years seem very different in length to a grown-up person compared
with what they do to you.  it is probable mr. heathcliff proposed going
from summer to summer, but never found a convenient opportunity; and now
it is too late.  don't trouble him with questions on the subject: it will
disturb him, for no good.'

the boy was fully occupied with his own cogitations for the remainder of
the ride, till we halted before the farmhouse garden-

t six;
the family had just finished breakfast: the servant was clearing and
wiping down the table.  joseph stood by his master's chair telling some
tale concerning a lame horse; and hareton was preparing for the hayfield.

'hallo, nelly!' said mr. heathcliff, when he saw me.  'i feared i should
have to come down and fetch my property myself.  you've brought it, have
you?  let us see what we can make of it.'

he got up and strode to the door: hareton and joseph followed in gaping
curiosity.  poor linton ran a frightened eye over the faces of the three.

'sure-ly,' said joseph after a grave inspection, 'he's swopped wi' ye,
maister, an' yon's his lass!'

heathcliff, having stared his son into an ague of confusion, uttered a
scornful laugh.

'god! what a beauty! what a lovely, charming thing!' he exclaimed.
'hav'n't they reared it on snails and sour milk, nelly?  oh, damn my
soul! but that's worse than i expected--and the devil knows i was not
sanguine!'

i bid the trembling and bewildered child

the meaning of his father's speech, or whether it
were intended for him: indeed, he was not yet certain that the grim,
sneering stranger was his father.  but he clung to me with growing
trepidation; and on mr. heathcliff's taking a seat and bidding him 'come
hither' he hid his face on my shoulder and wept.

'tut, tut!' said heathcliff, stretching out a hand and dragging him
roughly between his knees, and then holding up his head by the chin.
'none of that nonsense!  we're not going to hurt thee, linton--isn't that
thy name?  thou art thy mother's child, entirely!  where is my share in
thee, puling chicken?'

he took off the boy's cap and pushed back his thick flaxen curls, felt
his slender arms and his small fingers; during which examination linton
ceased crying, and lifted his great blue eyes to inspect the inspector.

'do you know me?' asked heathcliff, having satisfied himself that the
limbs were all equally frail and feeble.

'no,' said linton, with a gaze of vacant fear.

'you've heard o

ach him what he pleases to learn.  i've
ordered hareton to obey him: and in fact i've arranged everything with a
view to preserve the superior and the gentleman in him, above his
associates.  i do regret, however, that he so little deserves the
trouble: if i wished any blessing in the world, it was to find him a
worthy object of pride; and i'm bitterly disappointed with the
whey-faced, whining wretch!'

while he was speaking, joseph returned bearing a basin of milk-porridge,
and placed it before linton: who stirred round the homely mess with a
look of aversion, and affirmed he could not eat it. i saw the old
man-servant shared largely in his master's scorn of the child; though he
was compelled to retain the sentiment in his heart, because heathcliff
plainly meant his underlings to hold him in honour.

'cannot ate it?' repeated he, peering in linton's face, and subduing his
voice to a whisper, for fear of being overheard.  'but maister hareton
nivir ate naught else, when he wer a little 'un; a

'i _sha'n't_ eat it!' answered linton, snappishly.  'take it away.'

joseph snatched up the food indignantly, and brought it to us.

'is there aught ails th' victuals?' he asked, thrusting the tray under
heathcliff's nose.

'what should ail them?' he said.

'wah!' answered joseph, 'yon dainty chap says he cannut ate 'em.  but i

'don't mention his mother to me,' said the master, angrily.  'get him
something that he can eat,

that's all.  what is his usual food, nelly?'

i suggested boiled milk or tea; and the housekeeper received instructions
to prepare some.  come, i reflected, his father's selfishness may
contribute to his comfort.  he perceives his delicate constitution, and
the necessity of treating him tolerably.  i'll console mr. edgar by
acquainting him with the turn heathcliff's humour has taken.  having no
excuse for lingering longer, i slipped out, while linton was engaged in
timidly rebuffing the advances of a friendly sheep-dog.  but he was too
much on the alert to be cheated: as i closed the door, i heard a cry, and
a frantic repetition of the words--

'don't leave me!  i'll not stay here!  i'll not stay here!'

then the latch was raised and fell: they did not suffer him to come
forth.  i mounted minny, and urged her to a trot; and so my brief
guardianship ended.

to join her cousin, and such passionate tears and lamentations followed
the news of his departure that edgar himself was obliged to soothe her,
by affirming he should come back soon: he added, however, 'if i can get
him'; and there were no hopes of that.  this promise poorly pacified her;
but time was more potent; and though still at intervals she inquired of
her father when linton would return, before she did see him again his
features had waxed so dim in her memory that she did not recognise him.

when i chanced to encounter the housekeeper of wuthering heights, in
paying business visits to gimmerton, i used to ask how the young master
got on; for he lived almost as secluded as catherine herself, and was
never to be seen.  i could gather from her that he continued in weak
health, and was a tiresome inmate.  she said mr. heathcliff seemed to
dislike him ever longer and w

it: he had an antipathy to the sound of his voice, and could not do at

there seldom passed much talk between them: linton learnt his lessons and
spent his evenings in a small apartment they called the parlour: or else
lay in bed all day: for he was constantly getting coughs, and colds, and
aches, and pains of some sort.

'and i never know such a fainthearted creature,' added the woman; 'nor
one so careful of hisseln. he _will_ go on, if i leave the window open a
bit late in the evening. oh! it's killing, a breath of night air! and he
must have a fire in the middle of summer; and joseph's bacca-pipe is
poison; and

, with some toast and water or other slop on the hob to sip at; and
if hareton, for pity, comes to amuse him--hareton is not bad-natured,
though he's rough--they're sure to part, one swearing and the other
crying. i believe the master would relish earnshaw's thrashing him to a
mummy, if he were not his son; and i'm certain he would be fit to turn
him out of doors, if he knew half the nursing he gives hisseln. but then
he won't go into danger of temptation: he never enters the parlour, and
should linton show those ways in the house where he is, he sends him
up-stairs directly.'

i divined, from this account, that utter lack of sympathy had rendered
young heathcliff selfish and disagreeable, if he were not so originally;
and my interest in him, consequently, decayed: though still i was moved
with a sense of grief at his lot, and a wish that he had been left with
us.  mr. edgar encouraged me to gain information: he thought a great deal
about him, i fancy, and would have run some risk to see him;

t was also the anniversary of my late
mistress's death.  her father invariably spent that day alone in the
library; and walked, at dusk, as far as gimmerton kirkyard, where he
would frequently prolong his stay beyond midnight.  therefore catherine
was thrown on her own resources for amusement.  this twentieth of march
was a beautiful spring day, and when her father had retired, my young
lady came down dressed for going out, and said she asked to have a ramble
on the edge of the moor with me: mr. linton had given her leave, if we
went only a short distance and were back within the hour.

'so make haste, ellen!' she cried.  'i know where i wish to go; where a
colony of moor-game are settled: i want to see whether they have made
their nests yet.'

'that must be a good distance up,' i answered; 'they don't breed on the
edge of the moor.'

'no, it's not,' she said.  'i've gone very near with papa.'

i put on my bonnet and sallied out, thinking nothing more of the matter.
she bounded before me, and

of the grouse.  the heights were heathcliff's land, and he
was reproving the poacher.

'i've neither taken any nor found any,' she said, as i toiled to them,
expanding her hands in corroboration of the statement.  'i didn't mean to
take them; but papa told me there were quantities up here, and i wished
to see the eggs.'

heathcliff glanced at me with an ill-meaning smile, expressing his
acquaintance with the party, and, consequently, his malevolence towards
it, and demanded who 'papa' was?

'mr. linton of thrushcross grange,' she replied.  'i thought you did not
know me, or you wouldn't have spoken in that way.'

'you suppose papa is highly esteemed and respected, then?' he said,
sarcastically.

'and what are you?' inquired catherine, gazing curiously on the speaker.
'that man i've seen before.  is he your son?'

she pointed to hareton, the other individual, who had gained nothing but
increased bulk and strength by the addition of two years to his age: he
seemed as awkward and rough as ever.

in on us.  hareton, get forwards with the lass.  you shall walk with me,
nelly.'

'no, she's not going to any such place,' i cried, struggling to release
my arm, which he had seized: but she was almost at the door-stones
already, scampering round the brow at full speed.  her appointed
companion did not pretend to escort her: he shied off by the road-side,
and vanished.

'mr. heathcliff, it's very wrong,' i continued: 'you know you mean no
good.  and there she'll see linton, and all will be told as soon as ever
we return; and i shall have the blame.'

'i want her to see linton,' he answered; 'he's looking better these few
days; it's not often he's fit to be seen.  and we'll soon persuade her to
keep the visit secret: where is the harm of it?'

'the harm of it is, that her father would hate me if he found i suffered
her to enter your house; and i am convinced you have a bad design in
encouraging her to do so,' i replied.

'my design is as honest as possible.  i'll

inform you of its whole
scope,' he said.  'that the two cousins may fall in love, and get
married.  i'm acting generously to your master: his young chit has no
expectations, and should she second my wishes she'll be provided for at
once as joint successor with linton.'

'if linton died,' i answered, 'and his life is quite uncertain, catherine
would be the heir.'

'no, she would not,' he said.  'there is no clause in the will to secure
it so: his property would go to me; but, to prevent disputes, i desire
their union, and am resolved to bring it about.'

'and i'm resolved she shall never approach your house with me again,' i
returned, as we reached the gate, where miss cathy waited our coming.

heathcliff bade me be quiet; and, preceding us up the path, hastened to
open t

he door.  my young lady gave him several looks, as if she could not
exactly make up her mind what to think of him; but now he smiled when he
met her eye, and softened his voice in addressing her; and i was foolish
enough to imagine the memory of her mother might disarm him from desiring
her injury.  linton stood on the hearth.  he had been out walking in the
fields, for his cap was on, and he was calling to joseph to bring him dry
shoes.  he had grown tall of his age, still wanting some months of
sixteen.  his features were pretty yet, and his eye and complexion
brighter than i remembered them, though with merely temporary lustre
borrowed from the salubrious air and genial sun.

'now, who is that?' asked mr. heathcliff, turning to cathy.  'can you
tell?'

'your son?' she said, having doubtfully s

urveyed, first one and then the
other.

'yes, yes,' answered he: 'but is this the only time you have beheld him?
think!  ah! you have a short memory.  linton, don't you recall your
cousin, that you used to tease us so with wishing to see?'

'what, linton!' cried cathy, kindling into joyful surprise at the name.
'is that little linton?  he's taller than i am!  are you linton?'

the youth stepped forward, and acknowledged himself: she kissed him
fervently, and they gazed with wonder at the change time had wrought in
the appearance of each.  catherine had reached her full height; her
figure was both plump and slender, elastic as steel, and her whole aspect
sparkling with health and spirits.  linton's looks and movements were
very languid, and his form extremely slight; but there was a grace in his
manner that mitigated these defects, and rendered him not unpleasing.

after exchanging numerous marks of fondness with him, his cousin went to
mr. heathcliff, who lingered by the door, dividing his attention between
the objects inside and those that lay without: pretending, that is, to
observe the latter, and really noting the former alone.

'and you are my uncle, then!' she cried, reaching up to salute him.  'i
thought i liked you, though you were cross at first.  why don't you visit
at the grange with linton?  to live all these years such close
neighbours, and never see us, is odd: what have you done so for?'

'i visited it once or twice too often before you were born,' he answered.
'there--damn it!  if you have any kisses to spare, give them to linton:
they are thrown away on me.'

'naughty ellen!' exclaimed catherine, flying to attack me next with her
lavish caresses.  'wicked ellen! to try to hinder me from entering.  but
i'll take this walk every morning in future: may i, uncle? and sometimes
b

ring papa.  won't you be glad to see us?'

'of course,' replied the uncle, with a hardly suppressed grimace,
resulting from his deep aversion to both the proposed visitors.  'but
stay,' he continued, turning towards the young lady.  'now i think of it,
i'd better tell you.  mr. linton has a prejudice against me: we
quarrelled at one time of our lives, with unchristian ferocity; and, if
you mention coming here to him, he'll put a veto on your visits
altogether.  therefore, you must not mention it, unless you be careless
of seeing your cousin hereafter: you may come, if you will, but you must
not mention it.'

'why did you quarrel?' asked catherine, considerably crestfallen.

'he thought me too poor to wed his sister,' answered heathcliff, 'and was
grieved that i got her: his

briskly.  we calculate it will scarcely last till it is eighteen.  oh,
confound the vapid thing!  he's absorbed in drying his feet, and never
looks at her.--linton!'

'yes, father,' answered the boy.

'have you nothing to show your cousin anywhere about, not even a rabbit
or a weasel's nest?  take her into the garden, before you change your
shoes; and into the stable to see your horse.'

'wouldn't you rather sit here?' asked linton, addressing cathy in a tone
which expressed reluctance to move again.

'i don't know,' she replied, casting a longing look to the door, and
evidently eager to be active.

he kept his seat, and shrank closer to the fire.  heathcliff rose, and
went into the kitchen, and from thence to the yard, calling out for
hareton.  hareton responded, and presently the two re-entered.  the young
man had been washing himself, as was visible by the glow on his cheeks
and his wetted hair.

'oh, i'll ask _you_, u

perience the
consequence of scorning "book-larning," as you would say.  have you
noticed, catherine, his frightful yorkshire pronunciation?'

'why, where the devil is the use on't?' growled hareton, more ready in
answering his daily companion.  he was about to enlarge further, but the
two youngsters broke into a noisy fit of merriment: my giddy miss being
delighted to discover that she might turn his strange talk to matter of
amusement.

'where is the use of the devil in that sentence?' tittered linton.  'papa
told you not to say any bad words, and you can't open your mouth without
one.  do try to behave like a gentleman, now do!'

'if thou weren't more a lass than a lad, i'd fell thee this minute, i
would; pitiful lath of a crater!' retorted the angry boor, retreating,
while his face burnt with mingled rage and mortification! for he was
conscious of being insulted, and embarrassed how to resent it.

mr. heathcliff having overheard the conversation, as well as i, smiled
when he saw him go; bu
 
 ___________________________
 
 take papa's side, ellen: you are partial i know;
or else you wouldn't have cheated me so many years into the notion that
linton lived a long way from here.  i'm really extremely angry; only i'm
so pleased i can't show it!  but you must hold your tongue about _my_
uncle; he's my uncle, remember; and i'll scold papa for quarrelling with
him.'

and so she ran on, till i relinquished the endeavour to convince her of
her mistake.  she did not mention the visit that night, because she did
not see mr. linton.  next day it all came out, sadly to my chagrin; and
still i was not altogether sorry: i thought the burden of directing and
warning would be more efficiently borne by him than me.  but he was too
timid in giving satisfactory reasons for his wish that she should shun
connection with the household of the heights, and catherine liked good
reasons for every restraint that harassed her petted will.

'papa!' she exclaimed, after the morning's salutations, 'guess whom i saw
yesterday, in my walk on t

you started! you've not
done right, have you, now?  i saw--but listen, and you shall hear how i
found you out; and ellen, who is in league with you, and yet pretended to
pity me so, when i kept hoping, and was always disappointed about
linton's coming back!'

she gave a faithful account of her excursion and its consequences; and my
master, though he cast more than one reproachful look at me, said nothing
till she had concluded.  then he drew her to him, and asked if she knew
why he had concealed linton's near neighbourhood from her?  could she
think it was to deny her a pleasure that she might harmlessly enjoy?

'it was because you disliked mr. heathcliff,' she answered.

'then you believe i care more for my own feelings than yours, cathy?' he
said.  'no, it was not because i disliked mr. heathcliff, but because mr.
heathcliff dislikes me; and is a most diabolical man, delighting to wrong
and ruin those he hates, if they give him the slightest opportunity.  i
knew that you could not keep up a

n acquaintance with your cousin without
being brought into contact with him; and i knew he would detest you on my
account; so for your own good, and nothing else, i took precautions that
you should not see linton again.  i meant to explain this some time as
you grew older, and i'm sorry i delayed it.'

'but mr. heathcliff was quite cordial, papa,' observed catherine, not at
all convinced; 'and he didn't object to our seeing each other: he said i
might come to his house when i pleased; only i must not tell you, because
you had quarrelled with him, and would not forgive him for marrying aunt
isabella.  and you won't.  _you_ are the one to be blamed: he is willing
to let us be friends, at least; linton and

 i; and you are not.'

my master, perceiving that she would not take his word for her
uncle-in-law's evil disposition, gave a hasty sketch of his conduct to
isabella, and the manner in which wuthering heights became his property.
he could not bear to discourse long upon the topic; for though he spoke
little of it, he still felt the same horror and detestation of his
ancient enemy that had occupied his heart ever since mrs. linton's
death. 'she might have been living yet, if it had not been for him!' was
his constant bitter reflection; and, in his eyes, heathcliff seemed a
murderer. miss cathy--conversant with no bad deeds except her own slight
acts of disobedience, injustice, and passion, arising from hot temper
and thoughtlessness, and repented of on the day they were committed--was
amazed at the blackness of spirit that could brood on and cover revenge
for years, and deliberately prosecute its plans without a visitati

affliction as that, and be thankful for the friends you have, instead of
coveting more.'

'i'm not crying for myself, ellen,' she answered, 'it's for him.  he
expected to see me again to-morrow, and there he'll be so disappointed:
and he'll wait for me, and i sha'n't come!'

'nonsense!' said i, 'do you imagine he has thought as much of you as you
have of him?  hasn't he hareton for a companion?  not one in a hundred
would weep at losing a relation they had just seen twice, for two
afternoons.  linton will conjecture how it is, and trouble himself no
further about you.'

'but may i not write a note to tell him why i cannot come?' she asked,
rising to her feet.  'and just send those books i promised to lend him?
his books are not as nice as mine, and he wanted to have them extremely,
when i told him how interesting they were.  may i not, ellen?'

'no, indeed! no, indeed!' replied i with decision.  'then he would write
to you, and there'd never be an end of it.  no, miss catherine, the

sity and suspicions were roused; i determined to
take a peep at her mysterious treasures; so, at night, as soon as she and
my master were safe upstairs, i searched, and readily found among my
house keys one that would fit the lock.  having opened, i emptied the
whole contents into my apron, and took them with me to examine at leisure
in my own chamber.  though i could not but suspect, i was still surprised
to discover that they were a mass of correspondence--daily almost, it
must have been--from linton heathcliff: answers to documents forwarded by
her.  the earlier dated were embarrassed and short; gradually, however,
they expanded into copious love-letters, foolish, as the age of the
writer rendered natural, yet with touches here and there which i thought
were borrowed from a more experienced source.  some of them struck me as
singularly odd compounds of ardour and flatness; commencing in strong
feeling, and concluding in the affected, wordy style that a schoolboy
might use to a fancied, inc

g studies, she resorted to the solace of the drawer.  her father
sat reading at the table; and i, on purpose, had sought a bit of work in
some unripped fringes of the window-curtain, keeping my eye steadily
fixed on her proceedings.  never did any bird flying back to a plundered
nest, which it had left brimful of chirping young ones, express more
complete despair, in its anguished cries and flutterings, than she by her
single 'oh!' and the change that transfigured her late happy countenance.
mr. linton looked up.

'what is the matter, love?  have you hurt yourself?' he said.

his tone and look assured her _he_ had not been the discoverer of the
hoard.

'no, papa!' she gasped.  'ellen! ellen! come up-stairs--i'm sick!'

i obeyed her summons, and accompanied her out.

'oh, ellen! you have got them,' she commenced immediately, dropping on
her knees, when we were enclosed alone.  'oh, give them to me, and i'll
never, never do so again!  don't tell papa.  you have not told papa,
ellen? say you hav

lous secrets.  for shame! and you must have led the way in writing
such absurdities: he would not have thought of beginning, i'm certain.'

'i didn't!  i didn't!' sobbed cathy, fit to break her heart.  'i didn't
once think of loving him till--'

'_loving_!' cried i, as scornfully as i could utter the word.  '_loving_!
did anybody ever hear the like!  i might just as well talk of loving the
miller who comes once a year to buy our corn.  pretty loving, indeed! and
both times together you have seen linton hardly four hours in your life!
now here is the babyish trash.  i'm going with it to the library; and
we'll see what your father says to such _loving_.'

she sprang at her precious epistles, but i held them above my head; and
then she poured out further frantic entreaties that i would burn them--do
anything rather than show them.  and being really fully as much inclined
to laugh as scold--for i esteemed it all girlish vanity--i at length
relented in a measure, and asked,--'if i consent to burn

nor playthings?'

'we don't send playthings,' cried catherine, her pride overcoming her
shame.

'nor anything at all, then, my lady?' i said.  'unless you will, here i
go.'

'i promise, ellen!' she cried, catching my dress.  'oh, put them in the
fire, do, do!'

but when i proceeded to open a place with the poker the sacrifice was too
painful to be borne.  she earnestly supplicated that i would spare her
one or two.

'one or two, ellen, to keep for linton's sake!'

i unknotted the handkerchief, and commenced dropping them in from an
angle, and the flame curled up the chimney.

'i will have one, you cruel wretch!' she screamed, darting her hand into
the fire, and drawing forth some half-consumed fragments, at the expense
of her fingers.

'very well--and i will have some to exhibit to papa!'  i answered,
shaking back the rest into the bundle, and turning anew to the door.

she emptied her blackened pieces into the flames, and motioned me to

nder a shovelful of coals; and she mutely, and with a sense of
intense injury, retired to her private apartment.  i descended to tell my
master that the young lady's qualm of sickness was almost gone, but i
judged it best for her to lie down a while.  she wouldn't dine; but she
reappeared at tea, pale, and red about the eyes, and marvellously subdued
in outward aspect.  next morning i answered the letter by a slip of
paper, inscribed, 'master heathcliff is requested to send no more notes
to miss linton, as she will not receive them.'  and, henceforth, the
little boy came with vacant pockets.

summer drew to an end, and early autumn: it was past michaelmas, but the
harvest was late that year, and a few of our fields were still uncleared.
mr. linton and his daughter would frequently walk out among the reapers;
at the carrying of the last sheaves they stayed till dusk, and the
evening happening to be chill and damp, my master caught a bad cold, that

catherine amused herself with dancing to and fro before the door, while i
tried all the large keys in succession.  i had applied the last, and
found that none would do; so, repeating my desire that she would remain
there, i was about to hurry home as fast as i could, when an approaching
sound arrested me.  it was the trot of a horse; cathy's dance stopped
also.

'who is that?' i whispered.

'ellen, i wish you could open the door,' whispered back my companion,
anxiously.

'ho, miss linton!' cried a deep voice (the rider's), 'i'm glad to meet
you.  don't be in haste to enter, for i have an explanation to ask and
obtain.'

'i sha'n't speak to you, mr. heathcliff,' answered catherine.  'papa says
you are a wicked man, and you hate both him and me; and ellen says the
same.'

'that is nothing to the purpose,' said heathcliff.  (he it was.)  'i
don't hate my son, i suppose; and it is concerning him that i demand your
attention.  yes; you have cause to blush.  two or three months since

and less sensitive, as it turns out.  i've got your letters, and if you
give me any pertness i'll send them to your father.  i presume you grew
weary of the amusement and dropped it, didn't you?  well, you dropped
linton with it into a slough of despond.  he was in earnest: in love,
really.  as true as i live, he's dying for you; breaking his heart at
your fickleness: not figuratively, but actual

believe that vile nonsense.  you can feel in yourself it is impossible
that a person should die for love of a stranger.'

'i was not aware there were eavesdroppers,' muttered the detected
villain. 'worthy mrs. dean, i like you, but i don't like your
double-dealing,' he added aloud. 'how could _you_ lie so glaringly as to
affirm i hated the "poor child"? and invent bugbear stories to terrify
her from my door-stones? catherine linton (the very name warms me), my
bonny lass, i shall be from home all this week; go and see if have not
spoken truth: do, there's a darling! just imagine your father in my
place, and linton in yours; then think how you would value your careless
lover if he refused to stir a step to comfort you, when your father
himself entreated him; and don't, from pure stupidity, fall into the
same error. i swear, on my salvation, he's going to his grave, and none
but you can save him!'

the lock gave way and i i

'i swear linton is dying,' repeated heathcliff, looking hard at me.  'and
grief and disappointment are hastening his death.  nelly, if you won't
let her go, you can walk over yourself.  but i shall not return till this
time next week; and i think your master himself would scarcely object to
her visiting her cousin.'

'come in,' said i, taking cathy by the arm and half forcing her to
re-enter; for she lingered, viewing with troubled eyes the features of
the speaker, too stern to express his inward deceit.

ushed his horse close, and, bending down, observed--'miss catherine,
i'll own to you that i have little patience with linton; and hareton and
joseph have less.  i'll own that he's with a harsh set.  he pines for
kindness, as well as love; and a kind word from you would be his best
medicine.  don't mind mrs. dean's cruel cautions; but be generous, and
contrive to see him.  he dreams of you day and night, and cannot be
persuaded that you don't hate him, since you neither write nor call.'

i closed the door, and rolled a stone to assist the loosened lock in
holding it; and spreading my umbrella, i drew my charge underne

absorbed in my occupation, she recommenced her silent weeping: it
appeared, at present, her favourite diversion.  i suffered her to enjoy
it a while; then i expostulated: deriding and ridiculing all mr.
heathcliff's assertions about his son, as if i were certain she would
coincide.  alas!  i hadn't skill to counteract the effect his account had
produced: it was just what he intended.

'you may be right, ellen,' she answered; 'but i shall never feel at ease
till i know.  and i must tell linton it is not my fault that i don't
write, and convince him that i shall not change.'

what use were anger and protestations against her silly credulity?  we
parted that night--hostile; but next day beheld me on the road to
wuthering heights, by the side of my wilful young mistress's pony.  i
couldn't bear to witness her sorrow: to see her pale, dejected
countenance, and heavy eyes: and i yielded, in the faint hope that linton
himself might prove, by his reception of us, how little of the tale was

'na--ay!' he snarled, or rather screamed through his nose.  'na--ay! yah
muh goa back whear yah coom frough.'

'joseph!' cried a peevish voice, simultaneously with me, from the inner
room.  'how often am i to call you?  there are only a few red ashes now.
joseph! come this moment.'

vigorous puffs, and a resolute stare into the grate, declared he had no
ear for this appeal.  the housekeeper and hareton were invisible; one
gone on an errand, and the other at his work, probably.  we knew linton's
tones, and entered.

'oh, i hope you'll die in a garret, starved to death!' said the boy,
mistaking our approach for that of his negligent attendant.

he stopped on observing his error: his cousin flew to him.

'is that you, miss linton?' he said, raising his head from the arm of the
great chair, in which he reclined.  'no--don't kiss me: it takes my
breath.  dear me!  papa said you would call,' continued he, after
recovering a little from catherine's embrace; while she stood by looking

it's so cold!'

i stirred up the cinders, and fetched a scuttleful myself.  the invalid
complained of being covered with ashes; but he had a tiresome cough, and
looked feverish and ill, so i did not rebuke his temper.

'well, linton,' murmured catherine, when his corrugated brow relaxed,
'are you glad to see me?  can i do you any good?'

'why didn't you come before?' he asked.  'you should have come, instead
of writing.  it tired me dreadfully writing those long letters.  i'd far
rather have talked to you.  now, i can neither bear to talk, nor anything
else.  i wonder where zillah is!  will you' (looking at me) 'step into
the kitchen and see?'

hest, i replied--'nobody is out there but joseph.'

'i want to drink,' he exclaimed fretfully, turning away.  'zillah is
constantly gadding off to gimmerton since papa went: it's miserable!  and
i'm obliged to come down here--they resolved never to hear me up-stairs.'

'is your father attentive to you, master heathcliff?' i asked, perceiving
catherine to be checked in her friendly advances.

'attentive?  he makes them a little more attentive at least,' he cried.
'the wretches!  do you know, miss linton, that brute hareton laughs at
me!  i hate him! indeed, i hate them all: they are odious beings.'

cathy began searching for some water; she lighted on a pitcher in the
dresser, filled a tumbler, and brought it.  he bid her add a spoonful of
wine from a bottle on the table; and having swallowed a small portion,
appeared more tranquil, and said she was very kind.

'and are you glad to see me?' asked she, reiterating her former question
and pleased to detect the faint dawn of a smile.

'yes, i am.

you despised me; and if he had been in my place, he would be more the
master of the grange than your father by this time.  but you don't
despise me, do you, miss--?'

'i wish you would say catherine, or cathy,' interrupted my young lady.
'despise you?  no!  next to papa and ellen, i love you better than
anybody living.  i don't love mr. heathcliff, though; and i dare not come
when he returns: will he stay away many days?'

'not many,' answered linton; 'but he goes on to the moors frequently,
since the shooting season commenced; and you might spend an hour or two
with me in his absence.  do say you will.  i think i should not be
peevish with you: you'd not provoke me, and you'd always be ready to help
me, wouldn't you?'

'yes,' said catherine, stroking his long soft hair: 'if i could only get
papa's consent, i'd spend half my time with you.  pretty linton!  i wish
you were my brother.'

'and then you would like me as well as your father?' ob

linton denied that people ever hated their wives; but cathy affirmed they
did, and, in her wisdom, instanced his own father's aversion to her aunt.
i endeavoured to stop her thoughtless tongue.  i couldn't succeed till
everything she knew was out.  master heathcliff, much irritated, asserted
her relation was false.

'papa told me; and papa does not tell falsehoods,' she answered pertly.

'_my_ papa scorns yours!' cried linton.  'he calls him a sneaking fool.'

'yours is a wicked man,' retorted catherine; 'and you are very naughty to
dare to repeat what he says.  he must be wicked to have made aunt
isabella leave him as she did.'

'she didn't leave him,' said the boy; 'you sha'n't contradict me.'

'she did,' cried my young lady.

'well, i'll tell you something!' said linton.  'your mother hated your
father: now then.'

'oh!' exclaimed catherine, too enraged to continue.

'and she loved mine,' added he.

with passion.

'she did! she did!' sang linton, sinking into the recess of his chair,
and leaning back his head to enjoy the agitation of the other disputant,
who stood behind.

'hush, master heathcliff!' i said; 'that's your father's tale, too, i
suppose.'

'it isn't: you hold your tongue!' he answered.  'she did, she did,
catherine! she did, she did!'

cathy, beside herself, gave the chair a violent push, and caused him to
fall against one arm.  he was immediately seized by a suffocating cough
that soon ended his triumph.  it lasted so lo

'_i_ didn't strike you!' muttered cathy, chewing her lip to prevent
another burst of emotion.

he sighed and moaned like one under great suffering, and kept it up for a
quarter of an hour; on purpose to distress his cousin apparently, for
whenever he caught a stifled sob from her he put renewed pain and pathos
into the inflexions of his voice.

'i'm sorry i hurt you, linton,' she said at length, racked beyond
endurance.  'but i couldn't have been hurt by that little push, and i had
no idea that you could, either: you're not much, are you, linton?  don't
let me go home thinking i've done you harm.  answer! speak to me.'

'i can't speak to you,' he murmured; 'you've hurt me so that i shall lie
awake all night choking with this cough.  if you had it you'd know what
it was; but _you'll_ be comfortably asleep while i'm in agony, and nobody

he began to wail aloud, for very pity of himself.

'since you are in the habit of passing dreadful nights,' i said, 'it
won't be miss who spoils your ease: you'd be the same had she never come.
however, she shall not disturb you again; and perhaps you'll get quieter
when we leave you.'

'must i go?' asked catherine dolefully, bending over him.  'do you want
me to go, linton?'

'you can't alter what you've done,' he replied pettishly, shrinking from
her, 'unless you alter it for the worse by teasing me into a fever.'

'well, then, i must go?' she repeated.

'let me alone, at least,' said he; 'i can't bear your talking.'

she lingered, and resisted my persuasions to departure a tiresome while;
but as he neither looked up nor spoke, she finally made a movement to the
door, and i followed.  we were recalled by a scream.  linton had slid

 her, as she half knelt by the settle, and
converted her shoulder into a support.

'no, that won't do,' i said.  'you'll be content with the cushion, master
heathcliff.  miss has wasted too much time on you already: we cannot
remain five minutes longer.'

'yes, yes, we can!' replied cathy.  'he's good and patient now.  he's
beginning to think i shall have far greater misery than he will to-night,
if i believe he is the worse for my visit: and then i dare not come
again.  tell the truth about it, linton; for i musn't come, if i have
hurt you.'

'you must come, to cure me,' he answered.  'you ought to come, because
you have hurt me: you know you have extremely!  i was not as ill when you
entered as i am at present--was i?'

'but you've made yourself ill by crying and being in a passion.--i didn't
do it all,' said his cousin.  'however, we'll be friends now.  and you
want me: you would wish to see me sometimes, really?'

'i told you i did,' he replied impatiently.  'sit on the settle and let

you can sing; or you may say a nice long interesting ballad--one of those
you promised to teach me; or a story.  i'd rather have a ballad, though:
begin.'

catherine repeated the longest she could remember.  the employment
pleased both mightily.  linton would have another, and after that
another, notwithstanding my strenuous objections; and so they went on
until the clock struck twelve, and we heard hareton in the court,
returning for his dinner.

'and to-morrow, catherine, will you be here to-morrow?' asked young
heathcliff, holding her frock as she rose reluctantly.

'no,' i answered, 'nor next day neither.'  she, however, gave a different
response evidently, for his forehead cleared as she stooped and whispered
in his ear.

of the house.  'you are not dreaming of it, are you?'

she smiled.

'oh, i'll take good care,' i continued: 'i'll have that lock mended, and
you can escape by no way else.'

'i can get over the wall,' she said laughing.  'the grange is not a
prison, ellen, and you are not my gaoler.  and besides, i'm almost
seventeen: i'm a woman.  and i'm certain linton would recover quickly if
he had me to look after him.  i'm older than he is, you know, and wiser:
less childish, am i not?  and he'll soon do as i direct him, with some
slight coaxing.  he's a pretty little darling when he's good.  i'd make
such a pet of him, if he were mine.  we should never quarrel, should we
after we were used to each other?  don't you like him, ellen?'

'like him!' i exclaimed.  'the worst-tempered bit of a sickly slip that
ever struggled into its teens.  happily, as mr. he

i'm positive of that.  it's only a cold that ails him, the same as papa
has.  you say papa will get better, and why shouldn't he?'

'well, well,' i cried, 'after all, we needn't trouble ourselves; for
listen, miss,--and mind, i'll keep my word,--if you attempt going to
wuthering heights again, with or without me, i shall inform mr. linton,
and, unless he allow it, the intimacy with your cousin must not be
revived.'

'it has been revived,' muttered cathy, sulkily.

'must not be continued, then,' i said.

'we'll see,' was her reply, and she set off at a gallop, leaving me to
toil in the rear.

been wandering through the park, and therefore he demanded no explanation
of our absence.  as soon as i entered i hastened to change my soaked

weeks i remained incapacitated for attending to my duties: a calamity
never experienced prior to that period, and never, i am thankful to say,
since.

my little mistress behaved like an angel in coming to wait on me, and
cheer my solitude; the confinement brought me exceedingly low.  it is
wearisome, to a stirring active body: but few have slighter reasons for
complaint than i had.  the moment catherine left mr. linton's room she
appeared at my bedside.  her day was divided between us; no amusement
usurped a minute: she neglected her meals, her studies, and her play; and
she was the fondest nurse that ever watched.  she must have had a warm
heart, when she loved her father so, to give so much to me.  i said her
days were divided between us; but the master retired early, and i
generally needed nothing after six o'clock, thus the evening was her own.

and to put her back in the stable: you mustn't scold him either, mind.  i
was at the heights by half-past six, and generally stayed till half-past
eight, and then galloped home.  it was not to amuse myself that i went: i
was often wretched all the time.  now and then i was happy: once in a
week perhaps.  at first, i expected there would be sad work persuading
you to let me keep my word to linton: for i had engaged to call again
next day, when we quitted him; but, as you stayed up-stairs on the
morrow, i escaped that trouble.  while michael was refastening the lock
of the park door in the afternoon, i got possession of the key, and told
him how my cousin wished me to visit him, because he was sick, and
couldn't come to the grange; and how papa would object to my going: and
then i negotiated with him about the pony.  he is fond of reading, and he
thinks of leaving soon to get married; so

 he offered, if i would lend him
books out of the library, to do what i wished: but i preferred giving him
my own, and that satisfied him better.

'on my second visit linton seemed in lively spirits; and zillah (that is
their housekeeper) made us a clean room and a good fire, and told us
that, as joseph was out at a prayer-meeting and hareton earnshaw was off
with his dogs--robbing our woods of pheasants, as i heard afterwards--we
might do what we liked.  she brought me some warm wine and gingerbread,
and appeared exceedingly good-natured, and linton sat in the arm-chair,
and i in the little rocking chair on the hearth-stone, and we laughed and

n a glorious jubilee.  i said his heaven would be only half alive;
and he said mine would be drunk: i said i should fall asleep in his; and
he said he could not breathe in mine, and began to grow very snappish.  at
last, we agreed to try both, as soon as the right weather came; and then
we kissed each other and were friends.

'after sitting still an hour, i looked at the great room with its smooth
uncarpeted floor, and thought how nice it would be to play in, if we
removed the table; and i asked linton to call zillah in to help us, and
we'd have a game at blindman's-buff; she should try to catch us: you used
to, you know, ellen.  he wouldn't: there was no pleasure in it, he said;
but he consented to play at ball with me.  we found two in a cupboard,
among a heap of old toys, tops, and hoops, and battledores and
shuttlecocks.  one was marked c., and the other h.; i wished to have the

his name; but the bran came out of h.

him constantly: and he got cross again, and coughed, and returned to his
chair.  that night, though, he easily recovered his good humour: he was
charmed with two or three pretty songs--_your_ songs, ellen; and when i
was obliged to go, he begged and entreated me to come the following
evening; and i promised.  minny and i went flying home as light as air;
and i dreamt of wuthering heights and my sweet, darling cousin, till
morning.

i wished my father knew, and approved of my excursions: but it was
beautiful moonlight after tea; and, as i rode on, the gloom cleared.  i
shall have another happy evening, i thought to myself; and what delights
me more, my pretty linton will.  i trotted up their garden, and was
turning round to the back, when that fellow earnshaw met me, took my
bridle, and bid me go in by the front entrance.  he patted minny's neck,
and said she was a bonny beast, and appeared as if he wanted me to speak
to him.  i only told him to leave my horse alone, or else it would kick
him.  he answered in his vulgar accent, "it wouldn't do mitch hurt if it
did;" and surveyed its legs with a smile.  i was half inclined to make it

dead halt.

'"i cannot tell them yet," he answered.

'"oh, you dunce!" i said, laughing heartily at his failure.

'the fool stared, with a grin hovering about his lips, and a scowl
gathering over his eyes, as if uncertain whether he might not join in my
mirth: whether it were not pleasant familiarity, or what it really was,
contempt.  i settled his doubts, by suddenly retrieving my gravity and
desiring him to walk away, for i came to see linton, not him.  he
reddened--i saw that by the moonlight--dropped his hand from the latch,
and skulked off, a picture of mortified vanity.  he imagined himself to
be as accomplished as linton, i suppose, because he could spell his own
name; and was marvellously discomfited that i didn't think the same.'

'stop, miss catherine, dear!'--i interrupted.  'i shall not scold, but i
don't like your conduct there.  if you had remembered that hareton was
your cousin as much as master heathcliff, you would ha

ve felt how
improper it was to behave in that way.  at least, it was praiseworthy
ambition for him to desire to be as accomplished as linton; and probably
he did not learn merely to show off: you had made him ashamed of his
ignorance before, i have no doubt; and he wished to remedy it and please
you.  to sneer at his imperfect attempt was very bad breeding.  had you
been brought up in his circumstances, would you be less rude?  he was as
quick and as intelligent a child as ever you were; and i'm hurt that he
should be despised now, because that base heathcliff has treated him so
unjustly.'

'well, ellen, you won't cry about it, will

at my earnestness.  'but wait, and you shall hear if he conned his a b c

entered; linton was lying on the settle, and half got up to welcome me.

'"i'm ill to-night, catherine, love," he said; "and you must have all the
talk, and let me listen.  come, and sit by me.  i was sure you wouldn't
break your word, and i'll make you promise again, before you go."

'i knew now that i mustn't tease him, as he was ill; and i spoke softly
and put no questions, and avoided irritating him in any way.  i had
brought some of my nicest books for him: he asked me to read a little of

bout to comply, when earnshaw burst the door open: having
gathered venom with reflection.  he advanced direct to us, seized linton
by the arm, and swung him off the seat.

'"get to thy own room!" he said, in a voice almost inarticulate with
passion; and his face looked swelled and furious.  "take her there if she
comes to see thee: thou shalln't keep me out of this.  begone wi' ye
both!"

'he swore at us, and left linton no time to answer, nearly throwing him
into the kitchen; and he clenched his fist as i followed, seemingly
longing to knock me down.  i was afraid for a moment, and i let one
volume fall; he kicked it after me, and shut us out.  i heard a
malignant, crackly laugh by the fire, and turning, beheld that odious
joseph standing rubbing his bony hands, and quivering.

'"i wer sure he'd sarve ye out!  he's a grand lad!  he's getten t' raight

 expression of frantic, powerless fury.  he grasped the handle of the
door, and shook it: it was fastened inside.

'"if you don't let me in, i'll kill you!--if you don't let me in, i'll
kill you!" he rather shrieked than said.  "devil! devil!--i'll kill
you--i'll kill you!"

joseph uttered his croaking laugh again.

'"thear, that's t' father!" he cried.  "that's father!  we've allas

'feard--he cannot get at thee!"

'i took hold of linton's hands, and tried to pull him away; but he
shrieked so shockingly that i dared not proceed.  at last his cries were
choked by a dreadful fit of coughing; blood gushed from his mouth, and he
fell on the ground.  i ran into the yard, sick with terror; and called
for zillah, as loud as i could.  she soon heard me: she was milking the
cows in a shed behind the barn, and hurrying from her work, she inquired
what there was to do?  i hadn't breath to explain; dragging her in, i

issued from the shadow of the road-side, and checked minny and took hold
of me.

'"miss catherine, i'm ill grieved," he began, "but it's rayther too bad--"

'i gave him a cut with my whip, thinking perhaps he would murder me.  he
let go, thundering one of his horrid curses, and i galloped home more
than half out of my senses.

'i didn't bid you good-night that evening, and i didn't go to wuthering
heights the next: i wished to go exceedingly; but i was strangely
excited, and dreaded to hear that linton was dead, sometimes; and
sometimes shuddered at the thought of encountering hareton.  on the third
day i took courage: at least, i couldn't bear longer suspense, and stole
off once more.  i went at five o'clock, and walked; fancying i might
manage to creep into the house, and up to linton's room, unobserved.
however, the dogs gave notice of my approach.  zillah received me, and
saying "the lad was mending nicely," showed me into a small, tidy,
carpeted apartment, where, to my inexpressible joy,

me nor look at me, through a whole hour, ellen: he has such an unhappy
temper.  and what quite confounded me, when he did open his mouth, it was
to utter the falsehood that i had occasioned the uproar, and hareton was
not to blame!  unable to reply, except passionately, i got up and walked
from the room.  he sent after me a faint "catherine!"  he did not reckon
on being answered so: but i wouldn't turn back; and the

was properly formed.  it had appeared wrong to take the journey once; now
it seemed wrong to refrain.  michael came to ask if he must saddle minny;
i said "yes," and considered myself doing a duty as she bore me over the
hills.  i was forced to pass the front windows to get to the court: it
was no use trying to conceal my presence.

'"young master is in the house," said zillah, as she saw me making for
the parlour.  i went in; earnshaw was there also, but he quitted the room
directly.  linton sat in the great arm-chair half asleep; walking up to
the fire, i began in a serious tone, partly meaning it to be true--

'"as you don't like me, linton, and as you think i come on purpose to
hurt you, and pretend that i do so every time, this is our last meeting:
let us say good-bye; and tell mr. heathcliff that you have no wish to see
me, and that he mustn't invent any more falsehoods on the subject."

'"sit down and take your hat off, catherine," he answered.  "you are so
much happier than

n as happy and as healthy.  and believe that your kindness has made me
love you deeper than if i deserved your love: and though i couldn't, and
cannot help showing my nature to you, i regret it and repent it; and
shall regret and repent it till i die!"

'i felt he spoke the truth; and i felt i must forgive him: and, though we
should quarrel the next moment, i must forgive him again.  we were
reconciled; but we cried, both of us, the whole time i stayed: not
entirely for sorrow; yet i _was_ sorry linton had that distorted nature.
he'll never let his friends be at ease, and he'll never be at ease
himself!  i have always gone to his little parlour, since that night;
because his father returned the day after.

'about three times, i think, we have been merry and hopeful, as we were
the first evening; the rest of my visits were dreary and troubled: now
with his selfishness and spite, and now with his sufferings: but i've
learned to endure the former with nearly as little resentment as the
latter.

mr. heathcliff purposely avoids me: i have hardly seen him at
all.  last sunday, indeed, coming earlier than usual, i heard him abusing
poor linton cruelly for his conduct of the night before.  i can't tell
how he knew of it, unless he listened.  linton had certainly behaved
provokingly: however, it was the business of nobody but me, and i
interrupted mr. heathcliff's lecture by entering and telling him so.  he
burst into a laugh, and went away, saying he was glad i took that view of
the matter.  since then, i've told linton he must whisper his bitter
things.  now, ellen, you have heard all.  i can't be prevented from going
to wuthering heights, except by inflicting misery on two people; whereas,

'i'll make up my mind on that point by to-morrow, miss catherine,' i
replied.  'it requires some study; and so i'll leave you to your rest,
and go think it over.'

i thought it over aloud, in my master's presence; walking straight from
her room to his, and relating the whole story: with the exception of her
conversations with her cousin, and any mention of hareton.  mr. linton
was alarmed and distressed, more than he would acknowledge to me.  in the
morning, catherine learnt my betrayal of her confidence, and she learnt
also that her secret visits were to end.  in vain she wept and writhed
against the interdict, and implored her father to have pity on linton:
all she got to comfort her was a promise that he would write and give him
leave to come to the grange when he pleased; but explaining that he must
no longer expect to see catherine at wuthering heights.  perhaps

'these things happened last winter, sir,' said mrs. dean; 'hardly more
than a year ago.  last winter, i did not think, at another twelve months'
end, i should be amusing a stranger to the family with relating them!
yet, who knows how long you'll be a stranger?  you're too young to rest
always contented, living by yourself; and i some way fancy no one could
see catherine linton and not love her.  you smile; but why do you look so
lively and interested when i talk about her? and why have you asked me to
hang her picture over your fireplace? and why--?'

'stop, my good friend!' i cried.  'it may be very possible that _i_

with my little cathy: through winter nights and summer days she was a
living hope at my side.  but i've been as happy musing by myself among
those stones, under that old church: lying, through the long june
evenings, on the green mound of her mother's grave, and wishing--yearning
for the time when i might lie beneath it.  what can i do for cathy?  how
must i quit her?  i'd not care one moment for linton being heathcliff's
son; nor for his taking her from me, if he could console her for my loss.
i'd not care that heathcliff gained his ends, and triumphed in robbing me
of my last blessing!  but should linton be unworthy--only a feeble tool
to his father--i cannot abandon her to him!  and, hard though it be to
crush her buoyant spirit, i must persevere in making her sad while i
live, and leaving her solitary when i die.  darling!  i'd rather resign
her to god, and lay her in the earth before me.'

g advanced; yet my master gathered no real strength, though he
resumed his walks in the grounds with his daughter.  to her inexperienced
notions, this itself was a sign of convalescence; and then his cheek was
often flushed, and his eyes were bright; she felt sure of his recovering.
on her seventeenth birthday, he did not visit the churchyard: it was
raining, and i observed--'you'll surely not go out to-night, sir?'

he answered,--'no, i'll defer it this year a little longer.'  he wrote
again to linton, expressing his great desire to see him; and, had the
invalid been presentable, i've no doubt his father would have permitted
him to come.  as it was, being instructed, he returned an answer,
intimating that mr. heathcliff objected to his calling at the grange; but
his uncle's kind remembrance delighted him, and he hoped to meet him
sometimes in his rambles, and personally to petition that his cousin and
he might not remain long so utterly divided.

edgar, though he felt for the boy, could not consent to grant his
request; because he could not accompany catherine.  he said, in summer,
perhaps, they might meet: meantime, he wished him to continue writing at
intervals, and engaged to give him what advice and comfort he was able by
letter; being well aware of his hard position in his family.  linton
complied; and had he been unrestrained, would probably have spoiled all
by filling his epistles with complaints and lamentations: but his father
kept a sharp watch over him; and, of course, insisted on every line that
my master sent being shown; so, instead of penning his peculiar personal
sufferings and distresses, the themes constantly uppermost in his
thoughts, he harped on the cruel obligation of being held asunder from
his friend and love; and gently intimated that mr. linton must allow an

summer was already past its prime, when edgar reluctantly yielded his
assent to their entreaties, and catherine and i set out on our first ride
to join her cousin.  it was a close, sultry day: devoid of sunshine, but
with a sky too dappled and hazy to threaten rain: and our place of
meeting had been fixed at the guide-stone, by the cross-roads.  on
arriving there, however, a little herd-boy, despatched as a messenger,
told us that,--'maister linton wer just o' this side th' heights: and
he'd be mitch obleeged to us to gang on a bit further.'

'then master linton has forgot the first injunction of his uncle,' i
observed: 'he bid us keep on the grange land, and here we are off at
once.'

'well, we'll turn our horses' heads round when we reach him,' answered my
companion; 'our excursion shall lie towards home.'

but when we reached him, and that was scarcely a quarter of a mile from
his own door, we found he had no horse; and we were forced

ielded to a listless apathy; there was less of the peevish
temper of a child which frets and teases on purpose to be soothed, and
more of the self-absorbed moroseness of a confirmed invalid, repelling
consolation, and ready to regard the good-humoured mirth of others as an
insult.  catherine perceived, as well as i did, that he held it rather a
punishment, than a gratification, to endure our company; and she made no
scruple of proposing, presently, to depart.  that proposal, unexpectedly,
roused linton from his lethargy, and threw him into a strange state of
agitation.  he glanced fearfully towards the heights, begging she would
remain another half-hour, at least.

'but i think,' said cathy, 'you'd be more comfortable at home than
sitting here; and i cannot amuse you to-day, i see, by my tales, and
songs, and chatter: you have grown wiser than i, in these six months; you
have little taste for my diversions now: or else, if i could amuse you,
i'd willingly stay.'

'stay to rest yourself,' he r

eplied.  'and, catherine, don't think or say
that i'm _very_ unwell: it is the heavy weather and heat that make me
dull; and i walked about, before you came, a great deal for me.  tell
uncle i'm in tolerable health, will you?'

'i'll tell him that _you_ say so, linton.  i couldn't affirm that you
are,' observed my young lady, wondering at his pertinacious assertion of
what was evidently an untruth.

'and be here again next thursday,' continued he, shunning her puzzled
gaze.  'and give him my thanks for permitting you to come--my best
thanks, catherine.  and--and, if you _did_ meet my father, and he asked
you about me, don't lead him to suppose that i've been extremely silent
and stupid: don't look sad and downcast, as you are doing--he'll be
angry.'

pain, cathy began to seek solace in looking for bilberries, and sharing
the produce of her researches with me: she did not offer them to him, for
she saw further notice would only weary and annoy.

'is it half-an-hour now, ellen?' she whispered in my ear, at last.  'i
can't tell why we should stay.  he's asleep, and papa will be wanting us
back.'

'well, we must not leave him asleep,' i answered; 'wait till he wakes,
and be patient.  you were mighty eager to set off, but your longing to
see poor linton has soon evaporated!'

'why did _he_ wish to see me?' returned catherine.  'in his crossest
humours, formerly, i liked him better than i do in his present curious
mood.  it's just as if it were a task he was compelled to perform--this
interview--for fear his father should scold him.  but i'm hardly going to
come to give mr. heathcliff pleasure; whatever reason he may have for
ordering linton to undergo this penance.  and, though i'm glad he's
better in health, i'm sorry he's so much less pleasa

marked; 'i should conjecture
him to be far worse.'

linton here started from his slumber in bewildered terror, and asked if
any one had called his name.

'no,' said catherine; 'unless in dreams.  i cannot conceive how you
manage to doze out of doors, in the morning.'

'i thought i heard my father,' he gasped, glancing up to the frowning nab
above us.  'you are sure nobody spoke?'

'quite sure,' replied his cousin.  'only ellen and i were disputing
concerning your health.  are you truly stronger, linton, than when we
separated in winter?  if you be, i'm certain one thing is not
stronger--your regard for me: speak,--are you?'

the tears gushed from linton's eyes as he answered, 'yes, yes, i am!'
and, still under the spell of the imaginary voice, his gaze wandered up
and down to detect its owner.

cathy rose.  'for to-day we must part,' she said.  'and i won't conceal
that i have been sadly disappointed with our meeting; though i'll mention
it to nobody but you: not that i stand in awe of mr. he

athcliff.'

'hush,' murmured linton; 'for god's sake, hush!  he's coming.'  and he
clung to catherine's arm, striving to detain her; but at that
announcement she hastily disengaged herself, and whistled to minny, who
obeyed her like a dog.

'i'll be here next thursday,' she cried, springing to the saddle.
'good-bye. quick, ellen!'

and so we left him, scarcely conscious of our departure, so absorbed was
he in anticipating his father's approach.

before we reached home, catherine's displeasure softened into a perplexed
sensation o

f pity and regret, largely blended with vague, uneasy doubts
about linton's actual circumstances, physical and social: in which i
partook, though i counselled her not to say much; for a second journey

ongoings.  his nephew's offering of thanks was duly delivered, miss cathy
gently touching on the rest: i also threw little light on his inquiries,
for i hardly knew what to hide and what to reveal.

n of edgar linton's state.  the havoc that months had
previously wrought was now emulated by the inroads of hours.  catherine
we would fain have deluded yet; but her own quick spirit refused to
delude her: it divined in secret, and brooded on the dreadful
probability, gradually ripening into certainty.  she had not the heart to
mention her ride, when thursday came round; i mentioned it for her, and
obtained permission to order her out of doors: for the library, where her
father stopped a short time daily--the br

we deferred our excursion till the afternoon; a golden afternoon of
august: every breath from the hills so full of life, that it seemed
whoever respired it, though dying, might revive.  catherine's face was
just like the landscape--shadows and sunshine flitting over it in rapid
succession; but the shadows rested longer, and the sunshine was more
transient; and her poor little heart reproached itself for even that
passing forgetfulness of its cares.

we discerned linton watching at the same spot he had selected before.  my
young mistress alighted, and told me that, as she was resolved to stay a
very little while, i had better hold the pony and remain on horseback;
but i dissented: i wouldn't risk losing sight of the charge committed to
me a minute; so we climbed the slope of heath together.  master
heathcliff received us with greater animation on this occasion: not the
animation of high spirits though, nor yet of joy; it looked more like
fear.

e said, speaking short and with difficulty.  'is not your
father very ill?  i thought you wouldn't come.'

'_why_ won't you be candid?' cried catherine, swallowing her greeting.
'why cannot you say at once you don't want me?  it is strange, linton,
that for the second time you have brought me here on purpose, apparently
to distress us both, and for no reason besides!'

linton shivered, and glanced at her, half supplicating, half ashamed; but
his cousin's patience was not sufficient to endure this enigmatical
behaviour.

'my father _is_ very ill,' she said; 'and why am i called from his
bedside?  why didn't you send to absolve me from my promise, when you
wished i wouldn't keep it?  come!  i desire an explanation: playing and
trifling are

attendance on your affectations now!'

'my affectations!' he murmured; 'what are they?  for heaven's sake,
catherine, don't look so angry!  despise me as much as you please; i am a
worthless, cowardly wretch: i can't be scorned enough; but i'm too mean
for your anger.  hate my father, and spare me for contempt.'

'nonsense!' cried catherine in a passion.  'foolish, silly boy!  and
there! he trembles: as if i were really going to touch him!  you needn't
bespeak contempt, linton: anybody will have it spontaneously at your
service.  get off!  i shall return home: it is folly dragging you from
the hearth-stone, and pretending--what do we pretend?  let go my frock!
if i pitied you for crying and looking so very frightened, you should
spurn such pity.  ellen, tell him how disgraceful this conduct is.  rise,
and don't degrade yourself into an abject reptile--_don't_!'

with streaming face and an expression of agony, linton had thrown his
nerveless frame along the ground: he

die with you!'

my young lady, on witnessing his intense anguish, stooped to raise him.
the old feeling of indulgent tenderness overcame her vexation, and she
grew thoroughly moved and alarmed.

'consent to what?' she asked.  'to stay! tell me the meaning of this
strange talk, and i will.  you contradict your own words, and distract
me!  be calm and frank, and confess at once all that weighs on your
heart.  you wouldn't injure me, linton, would you?  you wouldn't let any
enemy hurt me, if you could prevent it?  i'll believe you are a coward,
for yourself, but not a cowardly betrayer of your best friend.'

'but my father threatened me,' gasped the boy, clasping his attenuated
fingers, 'and i dread him--i dread him!  i _dare_ not tell!'

'oh, well!' said catherine, with scornful compassion, 'keep your secret:
_i'm_ no coward.  save yourself: i'm not afraid!'

her magnanimity provoked his tears: he wept wildly, kissing her

ing hands, and yet could not summon courage to speak out.  i was
cogitating what the mystery might be, and determined catherine should
never suffer to benefit him or any one else, by my good will; when,
hearing a rustle among the ling, i looked up and saw mr. heathcliff
almost close upon us, descending the heights.  he didn't cast a glance
towards my companions, though they were sufficiently near for linton's
sobs to be audible; but hailing me in the almost hearty tone he assumed
to none besides, and the sincerity of which i couldn't avoid doubting, he
said--

'it is something to see you so near to my house, nelly.  how are you at
the grange?  let us hear.  the rumour goes,' he added, in a lower tone,
'that edgar linton is on his death-bed: perhaps they exaggerate his
illness?'

'no; my master is dying,' i replied: 'it is true enough.  a sad thing it
will be for us all, but a blessing for him!'

'

ast, do you think?' he asked.

'i don't know,' i said.

'because,' he continued, looking at the two young people, who were fixed
under his eye--linton appeared as if he could not venture to stir or
raise his head, and catherine could not move, on his account--'because
that lad yonder seems determined to beat me; and i'd thank his uncle to
be quick, and go before him!  hallo! has the whelp been playing that game
long?  i _did_ give him some lessons about snivelling.  is he pretty
lively with miss linton generally?'

'lively? no--he has shown the greatest distress,' i answered.  'to see
him, i should say, that instead of rambling with his sweetheart on the
hills, he ought to be in bed, under the hands of a doctor.'

'he shall be, in a day or two,' muttered heathcliff.  'but first--get up,
linton!  get up!' he shouted.  'don't grovel on the ground there up, this
moment!'

linton had sunk prostrate again in another paroxysm of helpless fear,
caused by his father's glance towards him, i suppose: t

 curbed ferocity, 'i'm getting angry and if you don't
command that paltry spirit of yours--_damn_ you! get up directly!'

'i will, father,' he panted.  'only, let me alone, or i shall faint.  i've
done as you wished, i'm sure.  catherine will tell you that i--that
i--have been cheerful.  ah! keep by me, catherine; give me your hand.'

'take mine,' said his father; 'stand on your feet.  there now--she'll
lend you her arm: that's right, look at her.  you would imagine i was the
devil himself, miss linton, to excite such horror.  be so kind as to walk
home with him, will you?  he shudders if i touch him.'

'linton dear!' whispered catherine, 'i can't go to wuthering heights:
papa has forbidden me.  he'll not harm you: why are you so afraid?'

'i can never re-enter that house,' he answered.  'i'm _not_ to re-enter
it without you!'

'stop!' cried his father.  'we'll respect catherine's filial scruples.
nelly, take him in, and i'll follow your advice concerning the doctor,
without delay.'

'you'll

do well,' replied i.  'but i must remain with my mistress: to
mind your son is not my business.'

'you are very stiff,' said heathcliff, 'i know that: but you'll force me
to pinch the baby and make it scream before it moves your charity.  come,
then, my hero.  are you willing to return, escorted by me?'

he approached once more, and made as if he would seize the fragile being;
but, shrinking back, linton clung to his cousin, and implored her to
accompany him, with a frantic importunity that admitted no denial.
however i disapproved, i couldn't hinder her: indeed, how could she have
refused him herself?  what was filling him with dread we had no means of
discerning; but there he was, powerless under its grip, and any addition
seemed capable of shocking him into idiotcy.  we reached the threshold;
catherine walked in, and i stood waiting till she had conducted the
invalid to a chair, expecting he

pushing me forward, exclaimed--'my house is not stricken with the plague,
nelly; and i have a mind to be hospitable to-day: sit down, and allow me
to shut the door.'

he shut and locked it also.  i started.

'you shall have tea before you go home,' he added.  'i am by myself.
hareton is gone with some cattle to the lees, and zillah and joseph are
off on a journey of pleasure; and, though i'm used to being alone, i'd
rather have some interesting company, if i can get it.  miss linton, take
your seat by _him_.  i give you what i have: the present is hardly worth
accepting; but i have nothing else to offer.  it is linton, i mean.  how
she does stare!  it's odd what a savage feeling i have to anything that
seems afraid of me!  had i been born where laws are less strict and
tastes less dainty, i should treat myself to a slow vivisection of those
two, as an evening's amusement.'

he drew in his breath, struck the table, and swore to himself, 'by hell!
i hate them.'

'i am not af

  'give me that key: i will have it!' she
said.  'i wouldn't eat or drink here, if i were starving.'

heathcliff had the key in his hand that remained on the table.  he looked
up, seized with a sort of surprise at her boldness; or, possibly,
reminded, by her voice and glance, of the person from whom she inherited
it.  she snatched at the instrument, and half succeeded in getting it out
of his loosened fingers: but her action recalled him to the present; he
recovered it speedily.

'now, catherine linton,' he said, 'stand off, or i shall knock you down;
and, that will make mrs. dean mad.'

regardless of this warning, she captured his closed hand and its contents
again.  'we _will_ go!' she repeated, exerting her utmost efforts to cause
the iron muscles to relax; and finding that her nails made no impression,
she applied her teeth pretty sharply.  heathcliff glanced at me a glance
that kept me from interfering a moment.  catherine was too intent on his
fingers to notice his face.  he opened them

staggered dizzily back and felt ready to suffocate, or to burst a
blood-vessel. the scene was over in two minutes; catherine, released,
put her two hands to her temples, and looked just as if she were not
sure whether her ears were off or on. she trembled like a reed, poor
thing, and leant against the table perfectly bewildered.

'i know how to chastise children, you see,' said the scoundrel, grimly,
as he stooped to repossess himself of the key, which had dropped to the
floor.  'go to linton now, as i told you; and cry at your ease!  i shall
be your father, to-morrow--all the father you'll have in a few days--and
you shall have plenty of that.  you can bear plenty; you're no weakling:
you shall have a daily taste, if i catch such a devil of a temper in your
eyes again!'

cathy ran to me instead of linton, and knelt down and put her burning
cheek on my lap, weeping aloud.  her cousin had shrunk into a corner of
the settle, as quiet as a mouse, congratulating himself, i dare say, tha

handed me a cup.

'wash away your spleen,' he said.  'and help your own naughty pet and
mine.  it is not poisoned, though i prepared it.  i'm going out to seek
your horses.'

our first thought, on his departure, was to force an exit somewhere.  we
tried the kitchen door, but that was fastened outside: we looked at the
windows--they were too narrow for even cathy's little figure.

'master linton,' i cried, seeing we were regularly imprisoned, 'you know
what your diabolical father is after, and you shall tell us, or i'll box
your ears, as he has done your cousin's.'

'yes, linton, you must tell,' said catherine.  'it was for your sake i
came; and it will be wickedly ungrateful if you refuse.'

'give me some tea, i'm thirsty, and then i'll tell you,' he answered.
'mrs. dean, go away.  i don't like you standing over me.  now, catherine,

'take you with her, pitiful changeling!' i exclaimed.  '_you_ marry?  why,
the man is mad! or he thinks us fools, every one.  and do you imagine
that beautiful young lady, that healthy, hearty girl, will tie herself to
a little perishing monkey like you?  are you cherishing the notion that
anybody, let alone miss catherine linton, would have you for a husband?
you want whipping for bringing us in here at all, with your dastardly
puling tricks: and--don't look so silly, now!  i've a very good mind to
shake you severely, for your contemptible treachery, and your imbecile
conceit.'

i did give him a slight shaking; but it brought on the cough, and he took
to his ordinary resource of moaning and weeping, and catherine rebuked
me.

'stay all night?  no,' she said, looking slowly round.  'ellen, i'll burn

you're in no danger; but if you hinder me--linton, i love papa better
than you!'  the mortal terror he felt of mr. heathcliff's anger restored
to the boy his coward's eloquence.  catherine was near distraught: still,
she persisted that she must go home, and tried entreaty in her turn,
persuading him to subdue his selfish agony.  while they were thus
occupied, our jailor re-entered.

'your beasts have trotted off,' he said, 'and--now linton! snivelling
again?  what has she been doing to you?  come, come--have done, and get
to bed.  in a month or two, my lad, you'll be able to pay her back her
present tyrannies with a vigorous hand.  you're pining for pure love, are

would have been incapable of regarding the childish act with sternness,
but he scowled on her and muttered--'oh! you are not afraid of me?  your
courage is well disguised: you seem damnably afraid!'

'i _am_ afraid now,' she replied, 'because, if i stay, papa will be
miserable: and how can i endure making him miserable--when he--when
he--mr. heathcliff, let _me_ go home!  i promise to marry linton: papa

what i'll willingly do of myself?'

'let him dare to force you,' i cried.  'there's law in the land, thank
god! there is; though we be in an out-of-the-way place.  i'd inform if he
were my own son: and it's felony without benefit of clergy!'

weeping bitterly.  'or marry me now.  poor papa!  ellen, he'll think
we're lost.  what shall we do?'

'not he!  he'll think you are tired of waiting on him, and run off for a

for morning; a deep sigh being the only answer i could obtain to my
frequent entreaties that she would try to rest.  i seated myself in a
chair, and rocked to and fro, passing harsh judgment on my many
derelictions of duty; from which, it struck me then, all the misfortunes
of my employers sprang.  it was not the case, in reality, i am aware; but
it was, in my imagination, that dismal night; and i thought heathcliff
himself less guilty than i.

at seven o'clock he came, and inquired if miss linton had risen.  she ran
to the door immediately, and answered, 'yes.'  'here, then,' he said,
opening it, and pulling her out.  i rose to follow, but he turned the
lock again.  i demanded my release.

'be patient,' he replied; 'i'll send up your breakfast in a while.'

i thumped on the panels, and rattled the latch angrily and catherine
asked why i was still shut up?  he answered, i must try to endure it
another hour, and they went away.  i endured it two or three hours; at
length, i heard a footst

instead of sitting down, i snatched my outdoor things, and hastened
below, for the way was free.  on entering the house, i looked about for
some one to give information of catherine.  the place was filled with
sunshine, and the door stood wide open; but nobody seemed at hand.  as i
hesitated whether to go off at once, or return and seek my mistress, a
slight cough drew my attention to the hearth.  linton lay on the settle,
sole tenant, sucking a stick of sugar-candy, and pursuing my movements
with apathetic eyes.  'where is miss catherine?' i demanded sternly,
supposing i could frighten him into giving intelligence, by catching him
thus, alone.  he sucked on like an innocent.

'is she gone?' i said.

'no,' he replied; 'she's upstairs: she's not to go; we won't let her.'

'you won't let her, little idiot!' i exclaimed.  'direct me to her room
immediately, or i'll make you sing out sharply.'

would be disappointed; and you felt then that she was a hundred times too
good to you: and now you believe the lies your father tells, though you
know he detests you both.  and you join him against her.  that's fine
gratitude, is it not?'

the corner of linton's mouth fell, and he took the sugar-candy from his
lips.

'did she come to wuthering heights because she hated you?' i continued.
'think for yourself!  as to your money, she does not even know that you

or he murmured her name.  i touched his hand, and spoke.

'catherine is coming, dear master!' i whispered; 'she is alive and well;
and will be here, i hope, to-night.'

i trembled at the first effects of this intelligence: he half rose up,
looked eagerly round the apartment, and then sank back in a swoon.  as
soon as he recovered, i related our compulsory visit, and detention at
the heights.  i said heathcliff forced me to go in: which was not quite
true.  i uttered as little as possible against linton; nor did i describe
all his father's brutal conduct--my intentions being to add no
bitterness, if i could help it, to his already over-flowing cup.

he divined that one of his enemy's purposes was to secure the personal
property, as well as the estate, to his son: or rather himself; yet why
he did not wait till his decease was a puzzle to my master, because
ignorant how nearly he and his nephew would quit the world together.
however, he felt that his will had better be altered: instead of leavi

should linton die.

having received his orders, i despatched a man to fetch the attorney, and
four more, provided with serviceable weapons, to demand my young lady of
her jailor.  both parties were delayed very late.  the single servant
returned first.  he said mr. green, the lawyer, was out when he arrived
at his house, and he had to wait two hours for his re-entrance; and then
mr. green told him he had a little business in the village that must be
done; but he would be at thrushcross grange before morning.

-'only
green,' and i went on, intending to send somebody else to open it; but
the knock was repeated: not loud, and still importunately.  i put the jug
on the banister and hastened to admit him myself.  the harvest moon shone
clear outside.  it was not the attorney.  my own sweet little mistress
sprang on my neck sobbing, 'ellen, ellen!  is papa alive?'

'yes,' i cried: 'yes, my angel, he is, god be thanked, you are safe with
us again!'

she wanted to run, breathless as she was, up-stairs to mr. linton's room;
but i compelled her to sit down on a chair, and made her drink, and
washed her pale face, chafing it into a faint colour with my apron.  then
i said i must go first, and tell of her arrival; imploring her to say,
she should be happy with young heathcliff.  she stared, but soon
comprehending why i counselled her to utter the falsehood, she assured me
she would not complain.

i couldn't abide to be present at their meeting.  i stood outside the
chamber-door a quarter of an hour, and hardl

mr. green took upon himself to order everything and everybody about the
place.  he gave all the servants but me, notice to quit.  he would have
carried his delegated authority to the point of insisting that edgar
linton should not be buried beside his wife, but in the chapel, with his
family.  there was the will, however, to hinder that, and my loud
protestations against any infringement of its directions.  the funeral
was hurried over; catherine, mrs. linton heathcliff now, was suffered to
stay at the grange till her father's corpse had quitted it.

she told me that her anguish had at last spurred linton to incur the risk
of liberating her.  she heard the men i sent disputing at the door, and
she gathered the sense of heathcliff's answer.  it drove her desperate.
linton who had been conveyed up to the little parlour soon after i left,
was terrified into fetching the key before his father re-ascended.  he

chapter xxix


the evening after the funeral, my young lady and i were seated in the
library; now musing mournfully--one of us despairingly--on our loss, now
venturing conjectures as to the gloomy future.

we had just agreed the best destiny which could await catherine would be
a permission to continue resident at the grange; at least during linton's
life: he being allowed to join her there, and i to remain as housekeeper.
that seemed rather too favourable an arrangement to be hoped for; and yet
i did hope, and began to cheer up under the prospect of retaining my home
and my employment, and, above all, my beloved young mistress; when a
servant--one of the discarded ones, not yet departed--rushed hastily in,
and said 'that devil heathcliff' was coming through the court: should he
fasten the door in his face?

if we had been mad enough to o

saying a word.  the sound of our informant's voice directed him to the
library; he entered and motioning him out, shut the door.

it was the same room into which he had been ushered, as a guest, eighteen
years before: the same moon shone through the window; and the same autumn
landscape lay outside.  we had not yet lighted a candle, but all the
apartment was visible, even to the portraits on the wall: the splendid
head of mrs. linton, and the graceful one of her husband.  heathcliff
advanced to the hearth.  time had little altered his person either.  there
was the same man: his dark face rather sallower and more composed, his
frame a stone or two heavier, perhaps, and no other difference.  catherine
had risen with an impulse to dash out, when she saw him.

'stop!' he said, arresting her by the arm.  'no more runnings away!  where
would you go?  i'm come to fetch you home; and i hope you'll be a dutiful
daughter and not enco

two hours, i called joseph to carry him up again; and since then my
presence is as potent on his nerves as a ghost; and i fancy he sees me
often, though i am not near.  hareton says he wakes and shrieks in the
night by the hour together, and calls you to protect him from me; and,
whether you like your precious mate, or not, you must come: he's your
concern now; i yield all my interest in him to you.'

'why not let catherine continue here,' i pleaded, 'and send master linton
to her?  as you hate them both, you'd not miss them: they can only be a
daily plague to your unnatural heart.'

'i'm seeking a tenant for the grange,' he answered; 'and i want my
children about me, to be sure.  besides, that lass owes me her services
for her bread.  i'm not going to nurture her in luxury and idleness after
linton is gone.  make haste and get ready, now; and don't oblige me to
compel you.'

'i shall,' said catherine.  'linton is all i have to love in the world,

from the griefs of her enemies.

'you shall be sorry to be yourself presently,' said her father-in-law,
'if you stand there another minute.  begone, witch, and get your things!'

she scornfully withdrew.  in her absence i began to beg for zillah's
place at the heights, offering to resign mine to her; but he would suffer
it on no account.  he bid me be silent; and then, for the first time,
allowed himself a glance round the room and a look at the pictures.
having studied mrs. linton's, he said--'i shall have that home.  not
because i need it, but--'  he turned abruptly to the fire, and continued,
with what, for lack of a better word, i must call a smile--'i'll tell you
what i did yesterday!  i got the sexton, who was digging linton's grave,
to remove the earth off her coffin lid, and i opened it.  i thought,
once, i would have stayed there: when i saw her face again--it is hers
yet!--he had hard work to stir me; but he said it would change if the air
blew on it, and so i s

truck one side of the coffin loose, and covered it
up: not linton's side, damn him!  i wish he'd been soldered in lead.  and
i bribed the sexton to pull it away when i'm laid there, and slide mine
out too; i'll have it made so: and then by the time linton gets to us
he'll not know which is which!'

'you were very wicked, mr. heathcliff!' i exclaimed; 'were you not
ashamed to disturb the dead?'

'i disturbed nobody, nelly,' he replied; 'and i gave some ease to myself.
i shall be a great deal more comfortable now; and you'll have a better
chance of keeping me underground, when i get there.  disturbed her?  no!
she has disturbed me, night and day, through eighteen
years--incessantly--remorselessly--till yesternight; and yesternight i
was tranquil.

-i could _almost_ see her, and yet i _could not_!  i ought
to have sweat blood then, from the anguish of my yearning--from the
fervour of my supplications to have but one glimpse!  i had not one.  she
showed herself, as she often was in life, a devil to me!  and, since
then, sometimes more and sometimes less, i've been the sport of that
intolerable torture!  infernal! keeping my nerves at such a stretch that,
if they had not resembled catgut, they would long ago have relaxed to the
feebleness of linton's.  when i sat in the house with hareton, it seemed
that on going out i should meet her; when i walked on the moors i should
meet her coming in.  when i went from home i hastened to return; she
_must_ be somewhere at the heights, i was certain!  and when i slept in
her chamber--i was beaten out of that.  i couldn't lie there; for the
moment i closed my eyes, she was either outside the window, or sliding
back the panels, or entering the room, or even resting her darling head
on the same pillow a

heathcliff fixed catherine's arm under his: though she disputed the act
at first evidently; and with rapid strides he hurried her into the alley,
whose trees concealed them.




chapter xxx


i have paid a visit to the heights, but i have not seen her since she
left: joseph held the door in his hand when i called to ask after her,
and wouldn't let me pass.  he said mrs. linton was 'thrang,' and the
master was not in.  zillah has told me something of the way they go on,
otherwise i should hardly know who was dead and who living.  she thinks
catherine haughty, and does not like her, i can guess by her talk.  my
young lady asked some aid of her when she first came; but mr. heathcliff
told her to follow her own business, and let his daughter-in-law look
after herself; and zillah willingly acquiesced, being a narrow-minded,
selfish woman.  catherine evinced a child's anno

repaid it with contempt, and thus enlisted my informant among her
enemies, as securely as if she had done her some great wrong.  i had a
long talk with zillah about six weeks ago, a little before you came, one
day when we foregathered on the moor; and this is what she told me.

'the first thing mrs. linton did,' she said, 'on her arrival at the
heights, was to run up-stairs, without even wishing good-evening to me
and joseph; she shut herself into linton's room, and remained till
morning.  then, while the master and earnshaw were at breakfast, she
entered the house, and asked all in a quiver if the doctor might be sent
for? her cousin was very ill.

'"we know that!" answered heathcliff; "but his life is not worth a
farthing, and i won't spend a farthing on him."

'"but i cannot tell how to do," she said; "and if nobody will help me,
he'll die!"

'"walk out of the room," cried the master, "and let me never hear a word
more about him!  none here

care what becomes of him; if you do, act the
nurse; if you do not, lock him up and leave him."

'then she began to bother me, and i said i'd had enough plague with the
tiresome thing; we each had our tasks, and hers was to wait on linton:
mr. heathcliff bid me leave that labour to her.

'how they managed together, i can't tell.  i fancy he fretted a great
deal, and moaned hisseln night and day; and she had precious little rest:
one could guess by her white face and heavy eyes.  she sometimes came
into the kitchen all wildered like, and looked as if she would fain beg
assistance; but i was not going to disobey the master: i never dare
disobey him, mrs. dean; and, though i thought it wrong that kenneth
should not be sent for, it

tinued, with a bitterness she couldn't conceal, "you have left me so
long to struggle against death alone, that i feel and see only death!  i
feel like death!"

'and she looked like it, too!  i gave her a little wine.  hareton and
joseph, who had been wakened by the ringing and the sound of feet, and
heard our talk from outside, now entered.  joseph was fain, i believe, of
the lad's removal; hareton seemed a thought bothered: though he was more
taken up with staring at catherine than thinking of linton.  but the
master bid him get off to bed again: we didn't want his help.  he
afterwards made joseph remove the body to his chamber, and told me to
return to mine, and mrs. heathcliff remained by herself.

'in the morning, he sent me to tell her she must come down to breakfast:
she had undressed, and appeared going to sleep, and said she was ill; at
which i hardly wondered.  i informed mr. heathcliff, and he
replied,--"well, let her be till after the funeral; and go up now and
then to get her wha

t is needful; and, as soon as she seems better, tell
me."'

cathy stayed upstairs a fortnight, according to zillah; who visited her
twice a day, and would have been rather more friendly, but her attempts
at increasing kindness were proudly and promptly repelled.

heathcliff went up once, to show her linton's will.  he had bequeathed
the whole of his, and what had been her, moveable property, to his
father: the poor creature was threatened, or coaxed, into that act during
her week's absence, when his uncle died.  the lands, being a minor, he
could not meddle with.  however, mr. heathcliff has claimed and kept them
in his wife's right and his also: i suppose legally; at any rate,
catherine, destitute of cash and friends, cannot disturb his possession.

'nobody,' said zillah, 'ever approached her do

and hareton,
absolutely dumb, on the other, i made a somewhat cheerless meal, and bade
adieu early.  i would have departed by the back way, to get a last
glimpse of catherine and annoy old joseph; but hareton received orders to
lead up my horse, and my host himself escorted me to the door, so i could
not fulfil my wish.

'how dreary life gets over in that house!' i reflected, while riding down
the road.  'what a realisation of something more romantic than a fairy
tale it would have been for mrs. linton heathcliff, had she and i struck
up an attachment, as her good nurse desired, and migrated together into
the stirring atmosphere of the town!'




chapter xxxii


1802.--this september i was invited to devastate the moors of a friend in
the north, and on my journey to his abode, i unexpectedly came within
fifteen miles of gimmerton.  the ostler at a roadside public-house was
holding a pail of water to refresh my horses, when a cart of very green
oats, newly reaped, passed by, and he remarked,--

ising unwillingly.

'hareton, i'll leave this book upon the chimney-piece, and i'll bring
some more to-morrow.'

'ony books that yah leave, i shall tak' into th' hahse,' said joseph,
'and it'll be mitch if yah find 'em agean; soa, yah may plase yerseln!'

cathy threatened that his library should pay for hers; and, smiling as
she passed hareton, went singing up-stairs: lighter of heart, i venture
to say, than ever she had been under that roof before; except, perhaps,
during her earliest visits to linton.

the intimacy thus commenced grew rapidly; though it encountered temporary
interruptions.  earnshaw was not to be civilized with a wish, and my
young lady was no philosopher, and no paragon of patience; but both their
minds tending to the same point--one loving and desiring to esteem, and
the other loving and desiring to be esteemed--they contrived in the end
to reach it.

you see, mr. lockwood, it was easy enough to win mrs. heathcliff's heart.
but now, i'm glad you did not try.  the crown of

my walk home was lengthened by a diversion in the direction of the kirk.
when beneath its walls, i perceived decay had made progress, even in
seven months: many a window showed black gaps deprived of glass; and
slates jutted off here and there, beyond the right line of the roof, to
be gradually worked off in coming autumn storms.

i sought, and soon discovered, the three headstones on the slope next the
moor: the middle one grey, and half buried in the heath; edgar linton's
only harmonized by the turf and moss creeping up its foot; heathcliff's
still bare.

i lingered round them, under that benign sky: watched the moths
fluttering among the heath and harebells, listened to the soft wind
breathing through the grass, and wondered how any one could ever imagine
unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.
