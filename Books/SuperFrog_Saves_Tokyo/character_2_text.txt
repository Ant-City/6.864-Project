 “the epicenter
will be close to the shinjuku ward office.”
“close to the shinjuku ward office?”
“to be precise, it will hit directly beneath the shinjuku branch of the tokyo security trust bank.”
a heavy silence followed.
“and you,” katagiri said, “are planning to stop this earthquake?”
“exactly” frog said, nodding. “that is exactly what i propose to do. you and i will go underground
beneath the shinjuku branch of the tokyo security trust bank to do mortal combat with worm.”

as a member of the trust bank lending division, katagiri had fought his way through many a battle.
he had weathered sixteen years of daily combat since the day he graduated from the university and
joined the bank’s staff. he was, in a word, a collection officer-- a post that won him little
popularity. everyone in his division preferred to make loans, especially at the time of the bubble.
they had so much money in those days that almost any likely piece of collateral--be it lan

was perfect for the job: no wife, no kids, both parents dead, a brother and sister he had put through
college married off. so what if they killed him? it wouldn’t change anything for anybody—least of
all for katagiri himself.
it was not katagiri but the thugs surrounding him who got nervous when they saw him so calm and
cool. he soon earned a kind of reputation in their world as a tough guy. now, though, the tough
katagiri was at a total loss. what the hell was this frog talking about?
“worm? who is worm?” he asked with some hesitation.
“worm lives underground. he is a gigantic worm. when he gets angry, he causes earthquakes,”
frog said. “and right now he is very, very angry.”
“what is he angry about?” katagiri asked.
“i have no idea,” frog said. “nobody knows what worm is thinking inside that murky head of his.
few have ever seen him. he is usually asleep. that’s what he really likes to do: take long, long naps.
he goes on sleeping for years—decades—in th

reverberation that comes his way, absorbing them into his body and storing them up. and then,
through some kind of chemical process, he replaces most of them with rage. why this happens i
have no idea. i could never explain it.”
frog fell silent watching katagiri and waiting until his words had sunk in. then he went on: “please
don’t misunderstand me, though. i feel no personal animosity toward worm. i don’t see him as the
embodiment of evil. not that i would want to be his friend, either: i just think that as far as the
world is concerned, it is, in a sense, all right for a being like him to exist. the world is like a great
big overcoat, and it needs pockets of various shapes and sizes. but right at the moment, worm has
reached the point where he is too dangerous to ignore. with all the different kinds of hatred he has
absorbed and stored inside himself over the years, his heart and bod

he experienced a revelation inspired by his
profound rage: it was time now for him, too, to cause a massive earthquake, and he’d do it here, in
tokyo. i know what i’m talking about, mr. katagiri: i have received reliable information on the
timing and scale of the earthquake from some of my best bug friends.”
frog snapped his mouth shut and closed his round eyes in apparent fatigue.
“so what you’re saying is,” katagiri said, “that you and i have to go underground together and fight
worm to stop the earthquake.” 
“exactly.”
katagiri reached for his cup of tea, picked it up and put it back. “i still don’t get it,” he said. “why
did you choose me to go with you?”
frog looked straight into katagiri’s eyes and said “i have always had the profoundest respect for you,
mr. katagiri. for sixteen long years, you have silently accepted the most dangerous, least glamorous
assignments—the jobs that others have avoided—and you have carried them off beautifully. i kno

. frog,” katagiri said.
“please,” frog said, raising one finger again. “call me ‘frog’.”
“tell me, frog,” katagiri said, “how do you know so much about me?”
‘well, mr. katagiri, i have not been frogging all these years for nothing. i keep my eye on the
important things in life.”
“but still, frog,” katagiri said. “i’m not particularly strong, and i don’t know anything about what’s
happening underground. i don’t have the kind of muscle it will take to fight worm in the darkness.
i’m sure you can find somebody a lot stronger than me—a man who does karate, say, or a selfdefense
forces commando.”
frog rolled his large eyes. “tell you the truth, mr. katagiri,” he said, “i’m the one who will do all
the fighting. but i can’t do it alone. this is the key thing: i need your courage and your passion for 
justice. i need you to stand behind me and say, ‘way to go, frog! you’re doing great! i know you
can win! you’re fighting the good fight!

’”
frog opened his arms wide, then slapped his webbed hands down on his knees again.
“in all honesty, mr. katagiri, the thought of fighting worm in the dark frightens me, too. for
many years i lived as a pacifist, loving art, living with nature. fighting is not something i like to do.
i do it because i have to. and this particular fight will be a fierce one; that is certain. i may not
return from it alive. i may lose a limb or two in the process. but i cannot—i will not-run away. as
nietzsche said, the highest wisdom is to have no fear. what i want from you, mr. katagiri, is for
you to share your simple courage with me, to support me

just gave them a little scare. a touch of psychological terror. as joseph conrad once wrote, true
terror is the kind that men feel toward their imagination. but never mind that, mr. . . katagiri.
tell me about the big bear case. it is working out well, i assume?”
katagiri nodded and lit a cigarette. “seems to be.”
“so, then, have i succeeded in gaining your trust with regard to the matter i broached to you last
night? will you join me to fight against worm?”
sighing, katagiri removed his glasses and wiped them. “to tell you the truth, i am not too crazy
about the idea, but i don’t suppose that’s enough to get me out of it.”
“no,” frog said. “it is a matter of responsibility and honor. you may not be ‘too crazy’ about the
idea, but we have no choice: you and i must go underground and face worm. if we should happen
to lose our lives in the process, we will gain no one’s sympathy. and even if we manage to defeat
worm, no one wi

s time. “all right, then, what do you want me to do?”
* * * * * * 
frog told katagiri his plan. they would go underground on the night of february 17 (one day
before the earthquake was scheduled to happen). their way in would be through the basement
boiler room of the shinjuku branch of the tokyo security trust bank. they would meet there late
at night (katagiri would stay in the building on the pretext of working overtime). behind a section
of wall was a vertical shaft, and they would find worm at the bottom by climbing down a 150-foot
rope ladder.
“do you have a battle plan in mind?” katagiri asked.
“of course i do. we would have no hope of defeating an enemy like worm without a battle plan.
he is a slimy creature: you can’t tell his mouth from his anus. and he is as big as a commuter
train.”
“what is your battle plan?”
after a thoughtful pause frog answered, “hmm, what is it they say—’silence is golden?”
“you mean i shouldn’t ask?”
“that’s one way of

terday, is that right?”
“right,” the nurse said. “and you had a really bad night, mr. katagiri. you must have had some
awful nightmares. i heard you yelling, ‘frog! hey, frog!’ you did it a lot. you have a friend
nicknamed frog?”
katagiri closed his eyes and listened to the slow, rhythmic beating of his heart as it ticked off the
minutes of his life. how much of what he remembered had actually happened and how much was
hallucination? did frog really exist, and had frog fought with worm to put a stop to the
earthquake? or had that just been part of a long dream? katagiri had no idea what was true
anymore.
* * * * * *
frog came to his hospital room that night. katagiri awoke to find him in the dim light, sitting on a
steel folding chair, his back against the wall. frog’s big, bulging eyelids were closed in straight slits.
“frog,” katagiri called out to him.
frog slowly opened his eyes. his big white stomach swelled and shrank with his breathing. “i

the boiler room at night the way i promised,” katagiri said, “but i had an
accident in the evening--something totally unexpected--and they brought me here.”
frog gave his head a slight shake. “i know. it’s ok. don’t worry. you were a great help to me in
my fight, mr. katagiri.”
“i was?” 
“yes, you were. you did a great job in your dreams. that’s what made it possible for me to fight
worm to the finish. i have you to thank for my victory.”
“i don’t get it,” katagiri said. “i was unconscious the whole time. they were feeding me
intravenously. i don’t remember doing anything in my dream.”
“that’s fine, mr. katagiri. it’s better that you don’t remember. the whole terrible fight occurred in
the area of imagination. that is the precise location of our battlefield. it is there that we experience
our victories and our defeats. each and every on of us is a being of

lives is decided not by how we win but by how we lose. you and i together, mr. katagiri, were able
to prevent the annihilation of tokyo. we saved 150,000 people from the jaws of death. no one
realizes it, but that is what we accomplished.”
“how did we manage to defeat worm? and what did i do?”
“we gave everything we had in a fight to the bitter end. we--” frog snapped his mouth shut and
took one great breath. “we used every weapon we could get our hands on, mr. katagiri. we used
all the courage we could muster. darkness was our enemy’s ally. you brought in a foot-powered
generator and used every ounce of your strength to fill the place with light. worm tried to frighten
you away with phantoms of the darkness, but you stood your ground. darkness vied wit

and bathed me in his horrid slime. i tore him to shreds, but still he refused to die. all he did was

frog fell silent, but soon, as if dredging up his last ounce of strength, he began to speak again.

“please,” katagiri said. “take a good, deep sleep.”
“i was finally unable to defeat worm,” frog said, closing his eyes. “i did manage to stop the
earthquake, but i was only able to carry our battle to a draw. i inflicted injury on him, and he on
me. but to tell you the truth, mr. katagiri...”
“what is it, frog?”
“i am, indeed, pure frog, but at the same time i am a thing that stands for a world of un-frog.” 
“hmm, i don’t get that at all.”

happening to frog. he stared at the spectacle, barely breathing.
then, all of a sudden, one of the boils burst with a loud pop. the skin flew off, and a sticky liquid
oozed out, sending a horrible smell across the room. the rest of the boils started popping, one after
another, twenty or thirty in all, flinging skin and fluid onto the walls. the sickening, unbearable
smell filled the hospital room. big black holes were left on frog’s body where the boils had burst,
and wriggling, maggot-like worms of all shapes and sizes came crawling out. puffy white maggots.
after them emerged some kind of small, centipede-like creatures, whose hundreds of legs made a
creepy rustling sound. an endless stream of these things came crawling out of the holes. frog’s
body--or the thing that had once been frog’s body--was totally covered by these creatures of the
night. his two big eyeballs fell from their sockets onto the floor, where they were devoured by black
bugs with strong jaws. crowds of slimy w

orms raced each other up the walls to the ceiling, where
they covered the fluorescent lights and burrowed into the smoke alarm. 
the floor, too, was covered with worms and bugs. they climbed up the lamp and blocked the light,
and, of course, they crept onto katagiri’s bed. hundreds of them came burrowing under the covers.
they crawled up his legs, under his bed gown, between his thighs. the smallest worms and maggots
crawled inside his anus and ears and nostrils. centipedes pried open his mouth and crawled inside,
one after another. filled with an intense despair, katagiri screamed.
someone snapped a switch and light filled the room.
“mr. katagiri!” called the nurse. katagiri opened his eyes to the light. his body was soaked in
sweat. the bugs were gone. all they had left behind in him was a horrible, slimy sensation.
“another bad dream, eh? poor dear.” with quick, efficient movements,
