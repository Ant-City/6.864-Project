e cigars there." babbitt did
like the cigars. he also liked the office, which was distinguished from
other offices only by the spirited change of the familiar wall-placard
to "this is the lord's busy day." chum frink came in, then william w.
eathorne.

mr. eathorne was the seventy-year-old president of the first state bank
of zenith. he still wore the delicate patches of side-whiskers which had
been the uniform of bankers in 1870. if babbitt was envious of the
smart set of the mckelveys, before william washington eathorne he was
reverent. mr. eathorne had nothing to do with the smart set. he was
above it. he was the great-grandson of one of the five men who founded
zenith, in 1792, and he was of the third generation of bankers. he could
examine credits, make loans, promote or injure a man's business. in his
presence babbitt breathed quickly and felt young.

the reverend dr. drew bounced into the room and flowered into speech:

"i've asked you gentlemen to stay so i can put a proposition before you.

"the more manly and practical a fellow is, the more he ought to lead the

there are but three or four old houses in floral heights, and in floral
heights an old house is one which was built before 1880. the largest of
these is the residence of william washington eathorne, president of the
first state bank.

the eathorne mansion preserves the memory of the "nice parts" of zenith
as they appeared from 1860 to 1900. it is a red brick immensity with
gray sandstone lintels and a roof of slate in courses of red, green, and
dyspeptic yellow. there are two anemic towers, one roofed with copper,
the other crowned with castiron ferns. the porch is like an open
tomb; it is supported by squat granite pillars above which hang frozen
cascades of brick. at one side of the hou

"oh, i am, am i! then, i won't talk at all!"

he longed, that evening, to see tanis judique, to be strengthened by
her sympathy. when all the family were up-stairs he got as far as
telephoning to her apartment-house, but he was agitated about it and
when the janitor answered he blurted, "nev' mind--i'll call later," and
hung up the receiver.

if babbitt had not been certain about vergil gunch's avoiding him, there
could be little doubt about william washington eathorne, next morning.
when babbitt was driving down to the office he overtook eathorne's car,
with the great banker sitting in anemic solemnity behind his chauffeur.
babbitt waved and cried, "mornin'!" eathorne looked at him deliberately,
hesitated, and gave him a nod more contemptuous than a direct cut.

babbitt's partner and father-in-law came in at ten:

"george, what's this i hear about some song and dance you gave colonel
snow about not wanting to join the g.c.l.? what the dickens you trying

home."

babbitt shook off the affectionate clasp--sheldy liked to hold hands for
a long time--and snarled, "well, i guess you fellows can run the show
without me. sorry, smeeth; got to beat it. g'day."

but afterward he winced, "if that white worm had the nerve to try to
drag me back to the old church home, then the holy outfit must have been
doing a lot of talking about me, too."

he heard them whispering--whispering--dr. john jennison drew,
cholmondeley frink, even william washington eathorne. the independence
seeped out of him and he walked the streets alone, afraid of men's
cynical eyes and the incessant hiss of whispering.

he tried to explain to his wife, as they prepared for bed, how
objectionable was sheldon smeeth, but all her answer was, "he has such
a beautiful voice--so spiritual. i don't think you ought to speak of him
like that just because you can't appreciate music!" he saw her then as a
stranger; he stared bleakly at this plump and fussy woman wi
