 in black. probably hired by the federal government. those suppressions were brutal." 

"couldn't it have been a rival carrier?" 

fallopian shrugged. oedipa showed him the waste symbol, and he shrugged again. 
"it was in the ladies' room, right here in the scope, mike." 
"women," he only said. "who can tell what goes on with them?" 

if she'd thought to check a couple lines back in the wharfinger play, oedipa might have made the next connection by herself. 
as it was she got an assist from one genghis cohen, who is the most eminent philatelist in the l.a. area. metzger, acting on 
instructions in the will, had retained this amiable, slightly adenoidal expert, for a percent of his valuation, to inventory and 
appraise inverarity's stamp collection. 

one rainy morning, with mist rising off the pool, metzger again away, the paranoids off somewhere to a recording session, 

oedipa got rung up by this genghis cohen, who even over the phone she could tell was disturbed. 

"there are some irregularities

r had taken the stamp albums to cohen from safe-deposit storage a week ago in oedipa's impala, and then she hadn't even 
been interested enough to look inside them. but now it came to her, as if the rain whispered it, that what fallopian had not 
known about private carriers, cohen might. 

 

when he opened the door of his apartment/office she saw him framed in a long succession or train of doorways, room 

after room receding in the general direction of santa monica, all soaked in rain-light. genghis cohen had a touch of 
summer flu, his fly was half open and he was wearing a barry goldwater sweatshirt also. oedipa felt at once motherly. in a 
room perhaps a third of the way along the suite he sat her in a rocking chair and brought real homemade dandelion wine in small 
neat glasses. 
"i picked the dandelions in a cemetery, two years ago. now the cemetery is gone. they took it out for the east san narciso 
freeway."

e irreversibly, leaving an overexposed blank when the ordinary world came back. in the space of a sip of dandelion 
wine it came to her that she would never know how many times such a seizure may already have visited, or how to grasp it 
should it visit again. perhaps even in this last second—but there was no way to tell. she glanced down the corridor of cohen's 
rooms in the rain and saw, for the very first time, how far it might be possible to get lost in this. 

"i have taken the liberty," genghis cohen was saying, "of getting in touch with an expert committee. i haven't yet 

forwarded them the stamps in question, pending your own authorization and of course mr metzger's. however, all fees, i am 
sure, can be charged to the estate." 
"i'm not sure i understand," oedipa said. 

"allow me." he rolled over to her a small table, and from a plastic folder lifted with tweezers, delicately, a u. s. 

commemorative stamp, the pony ex-

 taxis postal system in europe; its symbol was a muted post horn; 

sometime before 1853 it had appeared in america and fought the pony express and wells, fargo, either as outlaws in black, or 
disguised as indians; and it survived today, in california, serving as a channel of communication for those of unorthodox sexual 
persuasion, inventors who believed in the reality of  maxwell's  demon,  possibly her own husband, mucho maas (but she'd 
thrown mucho's letter long away, there was no way for genghis cohen to check the stamp, so if she wanted to find out for sure she'd 
have to ask mucho himself). 

either trystero did exist, in its own right, or it was being presumed, perhaps fantasied by oedipa, so hung up on and 

interpenetrated with the dead man's estate. here in san francisco, away from all tangible assets of that estate, there might still be a 
chance of getting the whole thing to go away and disintegrate quietly. she had only to drift tonight, at random, and watch nothing 
happen, to be c

nor yet the illegitimate usurpers of our rightful estate, can deter our couriers." and leaving them and their purses intact, the 
highwaymen, in a cracking of cloaks like black sails, vanished back into their twilit mountains. 

blobb inquired around about the trystero organization, running into zipped mouths nearly every way he turned. but he was able 
to collect a few fragments. so, in the days following, was oedipa. from obscure philatelic journals furnished her by genghis cohen, 
an ambiguous footnote in motley's rise of the dutch republic, an 8o-year-old pamphlet on the roots of modern anarchism, a book of 
sermons by blobb's brother augustine also among bortz's wharfingeriana, along with blobb's original clues, oedipa was able to fit 
together this account of how the organization began: 

in 1577, the northern provinces of the low countries, led by the protestant noble william of orange, had been struggling nine 
years for independence from catholic spain and a cath

them in their exile: the night. soon he had added to his iconography the muted post horn and a dead badger with its four 
feet in the air (some said that the name taxis came from the italian tasso, badger, referring to hats of badger fur the early 
bergamascan couriers wore). he began a sub rosa campaign of obstruction, terror and depredation along the thurn and taxis 
mail routes. 

oedipa spent the next several days in and out of libraries and earnest discussions with emory bortz and genghis cohen. 

she feared a little for their security in view of what was happening to everyone else she knew. the day after reading blobb's 
peregrinations she, with bortz, grace, and the graduate students, attended randolph driblette's burial, listened to a younger 
brother's helpless, stricken eulogy, watched the mother, spectral in afternoon smog, cry, and came back at night to sit on the 
grave and drink napa valley muscatel, which driblette in his time had put away barrels of. there was no moon, smog

 said, "mike, because everybody's been changing on me. but it hadn't gone as far as hating me." 
"hating you." he shook his head and laughed. 

"if you need any armbands or more weapons, do try winthrop tremaine, over by the freeway. tre-maine's swastika 

shoppe. mention my name." 

"we're already in touch, thanks." she left him, in his modified cuban ensemble, watching the floor, waiting for his broads to 

come back. 

well, what about her sources? she was avoiding the question, yes. one day genghis cohen called, sounding excited, 
and asked her to come see something he'd just got in the mail, the u. s. mail. it turned out to be an old american stamp, bearing 
the device of the muted post horn, belly-up badger, and the motto: we await silent tristero's empire. 

"so   that's  what  it  stands  for,"   said  oedipa. "where did you get this?" 
"a friend," cohen said, leafing through a battered scott catalogue, "in san francisco." as usual she did not go on to ask for 
any name or address. "odd. he

and she laughed nervously more than she spoke. waves of nausea, lasting five to ten minutes, would strike her at random, cause 
her deep misery, then vanish as if they had never been. there were headaches, nightmares, menstrual pains. one day she 
drove into l.a., picked a doctor at random from the phone book, went to her, told her she thought she was pregnant. they 
arranged for tests. oedipa gave her name as grace bortz and didn't show up for her next appointment. 

genghis cohen, once so shy, now seemed to come up with new goodies every other day—a listing in an outdated 

zumstein catalogue, a friend in the royal philatelic society's dim memory of some muted post horn spied in the catalogue of 
an auction held at dresden in 1923; one day a typescript, sent him by another friend in new york. it was supposed to be a 
translation of an article from an 1865 issue of the famous bibliotheque    des    timbrophiles    of    jean-baptiste moens.

"he decided to attend the auction in person," was all schrift would tell her. "you might run into him there." she might. 
the auction was duly held, on a sunday afternoon, in perhaps the oldest building in san narciso, dating from before 

world war ii. oedipa arrived a few minutes early, alone, and in a cold lobby of gleaming redwood floorboards and the smell 
of wax and paper, she met genghis cohen, who looked genuinely embarrassed. 

"please don't call it a conflict of interests," he drawled earnestly. "there were some lovely mozambique triangles i 

couldn't quite resist. may i ask if you've come to bid, miz maas." 
"no," said oedipa, "i'm only being a busybody." 
"we're in luck. loren passerine, the finest auctioneer in the west, will be crying today." 
"will be what?" 

"we say an auctioneer 'cries' a sale," cohen said.

she stood in a patch of sun, among brilliant rising and falling points of dust, trying to get a little warm, wondering if she'd go 
through with it. 

"it's time to start," said genghis cohen, offering his arm. the men inside the auction room wore black mohair and had 
pale, cruel faces. they watched her come in, trying each to conceal his thoughts. loren passerine, on his podium, hovered 
like a puppet-master, his eyes bright, his smile practiced and relentless. he stared at her, smiling, as if saying, i'm surprised you 
actually came. oedipa sat alone, toward the back of the room, looking at the napes of necks, trying to guess which one was 
her target, her enemy, perhaps her proo
