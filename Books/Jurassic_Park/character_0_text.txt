shore was a small island,
about two acres in size. ringed with dense vegetation, this island formed a protected sanctuary
where herds of herbivorous duckbilled dinosaurs laid their eggs in communal nests, and raised
their squeaking young.
over the millions of years that followed, the pale green alkaline lake grew shallower, and finally
vanished. the exposed land buckled and cracked under the heat. and the offshore island with its
dinosaur eggs became the eroded hillside in northern montana which alan grant was now
excavating.
"hey, alan!"
he stood, a barrel-chested, bearded man of forty. he heard the chugging of the portable
generator, and the distant clatter of the jackhammer cutting into the dense rock on the next hill.
he saw the kids working around the jackhammer, moving away the big pieces of rock after
checking them for fossils. at the foot of the hill, he saw the six tipis of his camp, the flapping mess
tent, and the trailer that served as their field laboratory. and he saw ellie waving to

 him, from the
shadow of the field laboratory.
"visitor!" she called, and pointed to the east.
grant saw the cloud of dust, and the blue ford sedan bouncing over the rutted road toward
them. he glanced at his watch: right on time. on the other hill, the kids looked up with interest.
they didn't get many visitors in snakewater, and there had been a lot of speculation about what a
lawyer from the environmental protection agency would want to see alan grant about.
but grant knew that paleontology, the study of extinct life, had in recent years taken on an
unexpected relevance to the modern world. the modem world was changing fast, and urgent
questions about the weather, deforestation, global warming, or the ozone layer often seemed
answerable, at least in part, with information from the past. information that paleontologists could
provide. he had been called as an expert witness twice in the past few years.
grant started down the hill to meet the

briefcase. "the reason i mention it," he said, "is that, according to the records, you were paid a
consultant's fee in connection with this island."
"i was?" grant said.
morris passed a sheet of paper to grant. it was the xerox of a check issued in march 1984
from ingen inc., farallon road, palo alto, california. made out to alan grant in the amount of
twelve thousand dollars. at the lower corner, the check was marked consultant
services/costa rica/juvenile hyperspace.
"ob, sure," grant said. "i remember that. it was weird as hell, but i remember it. and it didn't
have anything to do with an island." 
alan grant had found the first clutch of dinosaur eggs in montana in 1979, and many more in the
next two years, but he hadn't gotten around to publishing his findings until 1983. his paper, with

ellie sattler brushed a strand of blond hair back from her face and turned her attention to the acid
baths. she had six in a row, at molar strengths from 5 to 30 percent. she 'had to keep an eye on
the stronger solutions, because they would eat through the limestone and begin to erode the
bones. and infant-dinosaur bones were so fragile, she marveled that they had been preserved at
all, after eighty million years.
she listened idly as grant said, "miss levin? this is alan grant. what's this about a . . . you
have what? a what?" he began to laugh. "oh, i doubt that very much, miss levin. . . . no, i really 
don't have time, i'm sorry . . . . well, i'd take a look at it, but i can pretty much guarantee it's a
basilisk lizard. but . . . yes, you can do that. all right. send it now." grant hung up, and shook his
head. "these people."

division had a few
buildings, usually located in out-of-the-way corners. but the buildings were all concrete, with thick
walls. in side-view elevations they looked like concrete bunkers with small windows. like the nazi
pillboxes from old war movies.
at that moment, they heard a muffled explosion, and grant put the papers aside. "back to
work," he said.
"fire!"
there was a slight vibration, and then yellow contour lines traced across the computer screen.
this time the resolution was perfect, and alan grant had a glimpse of the skeleton, beautifully
defined, the long neck arched back. it was unquestionably an infant velociraptor, and it looked in

"i hate computers," grant said, squinting in the sun. "what happened now?"
"lost the integrator input," one of the kids said. "just a minute." the kid bent to look at the
tangle of wires going into the back of the battery-powered portable computer. they had set the
computer up on a beer carton on top of hill four, not far fro

head. tim was trying to organize his impressions, and 
was looking at the blond woman's legs, when he suddenly realized that he knew who the
bearded man was.
"your mouth is open," lex said.
tim said, "i know him."
"oh sure. you just met him."
"no," tim said. "i have his book."
the bearded man said, "what book is that, tim?" "lost
world of the dinosaurs, " tim said.
alexis snickered. "daddy says tim has dinosaurs on the brain," she said.
tim hardly heard her. he was thinking of what he knew about alan grant. alan grant was one
of the principal advocates of the theory that dinosaurs were warm-blooded. he had done lots of
digging at the place called egg hill in montana, which was famous because so many dinosaur
eggs had been found there. professor grant had found most of the dinosaur eggs that had ever
been discovered. he was also a good illustrator, and he drew the pictures for his own books.
"dinosaurs on the brain?" the bearded man said. "well, as a matter of fact, i have that same
problem."

et's have a look."
the woman got to her feet and stepped aside. tim heard nedry say, "it looks like a lizard."
the animal on the floor was about a foot and a half long, the size of a small monkey. it was
dark yellow with brown stripes, like a tiger. it had a lizard's head and long snout, but it stood
upright on strong hind legs, balanced by a thick straight tail. its smaller front legs waved in the air. it
cocked its head to one side and peered at the visitors staring down at it.
"velociraptor," alan grant said, in a low voice.
"velociraptor mongoliensis," wu said, nodding. "a predator. this one's only six weeks old."
" i just excavated a raptor," grant said, as he bent down for a closer look. immediately the little
lizard sprang up, leaping over grant's head into tim's arms.
"hey!"
"they can jump," wu said. "the babies can jump. so can the adults, as a matter of fact."
tim caught the velociraptor and held it to him. the little animal didn't weigh very much, a
pound or two. the skin was warm and
