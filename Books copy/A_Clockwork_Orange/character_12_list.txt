Mum - 
                Played by
Sheila Raynor
                Alex's mother, a well-intentioned
but weak and weepy woman. Mum's appearance is very fashionable,
and throughout the film she wears leather jumpers of various bright
colors, with her hair dyed to match. At the same time, she is old-fashioned,
with her hair set in the kind of permanent preferred by older women.
She works in a factory, an existence that contrasts with the wild
and disorderly ways of her son. Her main response to Alex's trouble
is to break into tears.
