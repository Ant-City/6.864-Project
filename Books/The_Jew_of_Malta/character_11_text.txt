     bellamira. since this town was besieg'd, my gain grows cold:
     the time has been, that but for one bare night
     a hundred ducats have been freely given;
     but now against my will i must be chaste:
     and yet i know my beauty doth not fail.
     ]from venice merchants, and from padua
     were wont to come rare-witted gentlemen,
     scholars i mean, learned and liberal;
     and now, save pilia-borza, comes there none,
     and he is very seldom from my house;
     and here he comes.

     pilia-borza.
     hold thee, wench, there's something for thee to spend.

     bellamira. 'tis silver; i disdain it.

     pilia-borza. ay, but the jew has gold,
     and i will have it, or it shall go hard.

     ithamore. o, the sweetest face that ever i beheld!  i know she
     is a courtezan by her attire:  now would i give a hundred of
     the jew's crowns that i had such a concubine.
     well, i have deliver'd the challenge in such sort,

     pilia-borza. i did.

     bellamira. and what thinkest thou? will he come?

     pilia-borza. i think so:  and yet i cannot tell; for, at the
     reading of the letter, he looked like a man of another world.

     bellamira. why so?

     pilia-borza. that such a base slave as he should be saluted by

     non-plus at the critical aspect of my terrible countenance.

     bellamira. and where didst meet him?

     gallows, conning his neck-verse, [147] i take it, looking of [148]
     a friar's execution; whom i saluted with an old hempen proverb,
     hodie tibi, cras mihi, and so i left him to the mercy of the
     hangman:  but, the exercise [149] being done, see where he comes.

     as if he had meant to make clean my boots with his lips; the
     effect was, that i should come to her house:  i wonder what the
     reason is; it may be she sees more in me than i can find in
     myself; for she writes further, that she loves me ever since she
     saw me; and who would not requite such love?  here's her house;
     and here she comes; and now would i were gone!  i am not worthy
     to look upon her.

     pilia-borza. this is the gentleman you writ to.

     handsome [aside].--pray, pardon me; i must go see a ship
     discharged.

     pilia-borza. and you can have it, sir, an if you please.

     ithamore. if 'twere above ground, i could, and would have it;
     but he hides and buries it up, as partridges do their eggs,

     freely?

     pilia-borza. at reading of the letter, he stared and stamped,
     and turned aside:  i took him by the beard, [156] and looked upon
     him thus; told him he were best to send it:  then he hugged and
