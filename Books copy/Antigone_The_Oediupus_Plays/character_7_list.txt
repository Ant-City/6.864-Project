Ismene - 
                	Oedipus's
daughter Ismene appears at the end of Oedipus the King and
to a limited extent in Oedipus at Colonus and Antigone. Ismene's
minor part underscores her sister's grandeur and courage. Ismene fears
helping Antigone bury Polynices but offers to die beside Antigone
when Creon sentences her to die. Antigone, however, refuses to allow
her sister to be martyred for something she did not have the courage
to stand up for.
