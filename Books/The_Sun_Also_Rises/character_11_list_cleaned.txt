                	a
bullfighter who fights on the same day as pedro romero. in his early
days, [CHARACTER] was a great and popular bullfighter. but when he
came out of retirement to fight again, he found he could never live
up to the legends that had grown around him. hence, he is bitter and
dejected. he seems to symbolize the entire lost generation in that
he feels out of place and purposeless in his later adult life.
