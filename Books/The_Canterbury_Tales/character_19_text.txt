in any case that mighte fall or hap;
and yet this manciple *set their aller cap*         *outwitted them all*

the reeve <49> was a slender choleric man
his beard was shav'd as nigh as ever he can.
his hair was by his eares round y-shorn;
his top was docked like a priest beforn
full longe were his legges, and full lean

47. the proverb says that every honest miller has a thumb of

notes to the prologue to the miller's tale

1. pilate, an unpopular personage in the mystery-plays of the
middle ages, was probably represented as having a gruff, harsh
voice.

2. wite: blame; in scotland, "to bear the wyte," is to bear the
blame.

whirling on ropes.  in french, "virer" means to turn; and the
explanation may, therefore, suit either reading. in modern slang
parlance, gerveis would probably have said, "on the rampage,"
or "on the swing" -- not very far from spelman's rendering.

39. he had more tow on his distaff: a proverbial saying: he was
playing a deeper game, had more serious business on hand.

the reeve's tale.

of absolon and hendy nicholas,
diverse folk diversely they said,
but for the more part they laugh'd and play'd;*           *were diverted
and at this tale i saw no man him grieve,
but it were only osewold the reeve.

when that our host had heard this sermoning,
he gan to speak as lordly as a king,
and said; "to what amounteth all this wit?
what? shall we speak all day of holy writ?
the devil made a reeve for to preach,
as of a souter* a shipman, or a leach**.                    *cobbler <8>

notes to the prologue to the reeves tale.


 1. "with blearing of a proude miller's eye": dimming his eye;
playing off a joke on him.

2. "me list not play for age": age takes away my zest for
drollery.

3. the medlar, the fruit of the mespilus tree, is only edible when
rotten.

4. yet in our ashes cold does fire reek: "ev'n in our ashes live
their wonted fires."

5. a colt's tooth; a wanton humour, a relish for pleasure.

6. chimb: the rim of a barrel where the staves project beyond
the head.

7. with olde folk, save dotage, is

lo, such it is a miller to be false.
and therefore this proverb is said full sooth,

and god that sitteth high in majesty

notes to the reeve's tale


1. the incidents of this tale were much relished in the middle
ages, and are found under various forms.  boccaccio has told
them in the ninth day of his "decameron".

2. camuse: flat; french "camuse", snub-nosed.

3. gite: gown or coat; french "jupe."

4. soler hall: the hall or college at cambridge with the gallery
or upper storey; supposed to have been clare hall.
(transcribers note: later commentators identify it with king's
hall, now merged with trinity college)

5. manciple:  stew

troth, in the west riding of yorkshire.
chaucer has given the scholars a dialect that may have belonged
to either district, although it more immediately suggests the
more northern of the two.
(transcribers note: later commentators have identified it with a
now vanished village near kirknewton in northumberland.
there was a well-known alein of strother in chaucer's
lifetime.)

8. wanges: grinders, cheek-teeth; anglo-saxon, "wang," the
cheek; german, "wange."

9. see note 1 to the prologue to the reeves tale

10. in the "cento novelle antiche," the story is told of a mule,
which pretends that his name is written on the bottom of his
hind foot. the wolf attempts to read it, the mule kills him with a
kick in the forehead; and the fox, looking on, remarks that
"every man of letters is not wise." a similar story is told in
"reynard the fox."

11. levesell: an arbour; anglo-saxon, "lefe-setl," leafy seat.

12. noth:  business; german, "noth," necessity.

13. bathe: both; scottice, "baith."

compare french "coquin," rascal.

25. unhardy is unsely: the cowardly is unlucky; "nothing
venture, nothing have;" german, "unselig," unhappy.

26. holy cross of bromeholm: a common adjuration at that
time; the cross or rood of the priory of bromholm, in norfolk,
was said to contain part of the real cross and therefore held in
high esteem.

27. in manus tuas: latin, "in your hands".



the cook's tale.


the prologue.


the cook of london, while the reeve thus spake,
for joy he laugh'd and clapp'd him on the back:
"aha!" quoth he, "for christes passion,
this miller had a sharp conclusion,
upon this argument of herbergage.*                              *lodging
well saide solomon in his language,
bring thou not every man into thine house,
for harbouring by night is perilous.
*well ought a man avised for to be*        *a man should take good heed*

though i come after him with hawebake*;                        *lout <8>

and with that word, he with a sober cheer
began his tale, and said as ye shall hear.


notes to the prologue to the man of law's tale


1. plight: pulled; the word is an obsolete past tense from
"pluck."

2. no more than will malkin's maidenhead: a proverbial saying;
which, however, had obtained fresh point from the reeve's
tale, to which the host doubtless refers.

3. de par dieux jeo asente: "by god, i agree".  it is
characteristic that the somewhat pompous sergeant of law
should couch his assent in the semi-barbarous french, then
familiar in law procedure.

4. ceyx and alcyon: chaucer treats of these in the introduction
to the poem called "the book of the duchess."  it relates to the
death of blanche, wife of john of gaunt, duke of lancaster, the
poet's patron, and afterwards his connexion by marriage.

an archdeacon, a man of high degree,
that boldely did execution,
in punishing of fornication,
of witchecraft, and eke of bawdery,
of defamation, and adultery,
of churche-reeves,* and of testaments,                    *churchwardens

they prey; the
thorn on which they do this was said to become poisonous.

8. medieval legends located hell in the north.

9. the pythoness: the witch, or woman, possesed with a
prophesying spirit; from the greek, "pythia."  chaucer of
course refers to the raising of samuel's spirit by the witch of
endor.

10. dante and virgil were both poets who had in fancy visited
hell.

11. tholed: suffered, endured; "thole" is still used in scotland in
the same sense.

12. capels: horses. see note 14 to the reeve's tale.

13. liart: grey; elsewhere applied by chaucer to the hairs of an
old man. so burns, in the "cotter's saturday night," speaks of
the gray temples of "the sire" -- "his lyart haffets wearing thin
and bare."

14. rebeck: a kind of fiddle; used like "ribibe," as a nickname
for a shrill old scold.

15. trot; a contemptuous term for an old woman who has
trotted about much, or who moves with quick short steps.

16. in his await: on the watch; french, "aux aguets."

italian, "podesta."  seneca relates the story of cornelius piso;
"de ira," i. 16.

20. placebo: an anthem of the roman church, from psalm
cxvi. 9, which in the vulgate reads, "placebo domino in regione
vivorum" -- "i will please the lord in the land of the living"

21. the gysen:  seneca calls it the gyndes; sir john mandeville
tells the story of the euphrates. "gihon," was the name of one
of the four rivers of eden (gen. ii, 13).

22. him that harrowed hell: christ. see note 14 to the reeve's
tale.

23. mr. wright says that "it was a common practice to grant
under the conventual seal to benefactors and others a brotherly
participation in the spiritual good works of the convent, and in
their expected reward after death."

24. the friar had received a master's degree.

25. the regular number of monks or friars in a convent was
fixed at twelve,  with a superior, in imitation of the apostles and
their master; and large religious houses were held to consist of
so many convents.

28. flaw: yellow; latin, "flavus," french, "fauve."

29. bass: kiss; french, "baiser;" and hence the more vulgar
"buss."

30. maximian: cornelius maximianus gallus flourished in the
time of the emperor anastasius; in one of his elegies, he
professed a preference for flaming and somewhat swelling lips,
which, when he tasted them, would give him full kisses.

31. dwale: sleeping potion, narcotic. see note 19 to the reeve's
tale.

32. environ: around; french, "a l'environ."

33. cast off thine heart: i.e.  from confidence in her.

34. nesh: soft, delicate; anglo-saxon, "nese."

35. perfection: perfectly holy life, in the performance of vows
of poverty, chastity, obedience, and other modes of mortifying
the flesh.

vows before they knew our own dispositions, or ability, to keep
them.

e such as look after beauty and worldly
pleasure. but they that honour the leaf, which abideth with the
root, notwithstanding the frosts and winter storms, are they
which follow virtue and during qualities, without regard of
worldly respects." mr bell, in his edition, has properly noticed
that there is no explanation of the emblematical import of the
medlar-tree, the goldfinch, and the nightingale. "but," he says,
"as the fruit of the medlar, to use chaucer's own expression (see
prologue to the reeve's tale), is rotten before it is ripe, it may
be the emblem of sensual pleasure, which palls before it confers
real enjoyment. the goldfinch is remarkable for the beauty of its
plumage, the sprightliness of its movements, and its gay,
tinkling song, and may be supposed to represent the showy and
unsubstantial character of frivolous pleasures. the nightingale's
sober outward appearance and impassioned song denote greater
depth of feeling." the poem throughout is marked by the purest

poem was composed, points clearly to chaucer's daily work as
comptroller of the customs -- a post which he held from 1374
to 1386.

13. this is a frank enough admission that the poet was fond of
good cheer; and the effect of his "little abstinence" on his
corporeal appearance is humorously described in the prologue
to the tale of sir thopas, where the host compliments chaucer
on being as well shapen in the waist as himself.

14. "to make the beard" means to befool or deceive. see note
15 to the reeve's tale. precisely the same idea is conveyed in
the modern slang word "shave" -- meaning a trick or fraud.

15. love-days: see note 21 to the prologue to the canterbury
tales.

16. if this reference is to any book of chaucer's in which the
house of fame was mentioned, the book has not come down to
us. it has been reasonably supposed, however, that chaucer
means by "his own book" ovid's "metamorphoses," of which he
was evidently very fond; and in the twelfth book of that poem
the temple of fame i
