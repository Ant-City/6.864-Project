time, before we could engender between us and hold intact the pattern of re-capitulant
mimic furious victory like a cloth, a shield between ourselves and reality, between us and
fact and doom. this afternoon it seemed as if we would never get it filled, wet enough,
since there had not even been dew in three weeks. but at last it was damp enough,
damp-colored enough at least, and we could begin. we were just about to begin. then
suddenly loosh was standing there, watching us. he was joby's son and ringo's uncle; he
stood there (we did not know where he had come from; we had not seen him appear,
emerge) in the fierce dull early afternoon sunlight, bareheaded, his head slanted a little,
tilted a little yet firm and not askew, like a cannonball (which it resembled) bedded
hurriedly and carelessly in concrete, his eyes a little red at the inner corners as negroes'
eyes get when they have been drinking, looking down at what ringo and i called
vicksburg. then i saw philadelphy, his w

called granny 'granny' just like i did, until maybe he wasn't a nigger anymore or maybe i
wasn't a white boy anymore, the two of us neither, not even people any longer: the two
supreme undefeated like two moths, two feathers riding above a hurricane. so we were
both at it; we didn't see louvinia, joby's wife and ringo's grandmother, at all. we were
facing one another at scarcely arms' length, to the other each invisible in the furious slow
jerking of the flung dust, yelling "kill the bastuds! kill them! kill them!" when her voice
seemed to descend upon us like an enormous hand, flattening the very dust which we
had raised, leaving us now visible to one another, dust-colored ourselves to the eyes and
still in the act of throwing:

that afternoon we built the stock pen. we built it deep in the creek bottom, where you
could not have found it unless you had known where to look, and you could not have
seen it until you came to the new sap-sweating, axe-ended rails woven through and into
the jungle growth itself. we were all there--father and joby and ringo and loosh and me--
father in the boots still but with his coat off now, so that we saw for the first time that his
trousers were not confederate ones but were yankee ones, of new strong blue cloth,
which they (he and his troop) had captured, and without the sabre now too. we worked
fast, felling the saplings--the willow and pin oak, the swamp maple and chinkapin--and,
without even waiting hardly to trim them, dragging them behind the mules and by hand
too, through the mud and the brie

rs to where father waited. and that was it too; father
was everywhere, with a sapling under each arm going through the brush and briers almost
faster than the mules; racking the rails into place while joby and loosh were still arguing
about which end of the rail went where. that was it: not that father worked faster and

doing; it was the way he did it. when he sat at his old place at the table in the diningroom
and finished the side meat and greens and the cornbread and milk which louvinia
brought him (and we watching and waiting, ringo and i at least, waiting for night and the
talking, the telling) and wiped his beard and said, "now we're going to build a new pen.
we'll have to cut the rails, too"; when he said that, ringo and i probably had exactly the
same vision. there would be all of us there--joby and loosh and ringo and me on the
edge of the bottom and drawn up into a kind of order--an order partaking not of any
lusting and sweating for assault or even victory, but rather of that passive yet dynamic
affirmation which napoleon's troops must have felt--and facing us, between us and the
bottom, between us and the waiting sap-running boles which were about to be
transposed into dead rails, father. he was on jupiter now; he wore the frogged gray field-

than most folks could hope to look) standing in the stirrups above the smoke-colored
diminishing thunderbolt, beneath the arcy and myriad glitter of the sabre from which the
chosen saplings, sheared trimmed and lopped, sprang into neat and waiting windrows,
requiring only the carrying and the placing to become a fence. the sun had gone out of
the bottom when we finished the fence, that is, left joby and loosh with the last three
panels to put up, but it was still shining up the slope of the pasture when we rode across it, i
behind father on one of the mules and ringo on the other one. but it was gone even from
the pasture by the time i had left father at the house and returned to the stable, where
ringo already had a lead rope on the cow. so we went back to the new pen, with the
calf following nuzzling and prodding at the cow every time she stopped to snatch a
mouthful of grass, and the so

 see the lamp in the kitchen and the shadow of someone moving across the
window. when ringo and i came in, louvinia was just closing one of the big trunks from the
attic, which hadn't been down stairs since the christmas four years ago which we spent at
hawkhurst, when there wasn't any war and uncle dennison was still alive. it was a big trunk
and heavy even when empty; it had not been in the kitchen when we left to build the pen
so it had been fetched down some time during the afternoon, while joby and loosh were
in the bottom and nobody there to carry it down but granny and louvinia, and then
father later, after we came back to the house on the mule, so that was a part of the need
and urgency too; maybe it was father who carried the trunk down from the attic too. and
when i went in to supper, the table was set with the kitchen knives and forks in place of the
silver ones, and the sideboard (on which the silver service had been sitting when i began
to remember and where it had been sittin

(retreating, he said).

so ringo and i squatted again and waited quietly while granny sewed beside the
lamp on the table and father sat in his old chair in its old place, his muddy boots crossed
and lifted into the old heel-marks beside the cold and empty fireplace, chewing the
tobacco which joby had loaned him. joby was a good deal older than father. he was
too old to have been caught short of tobacco just by a war. he had come to mississippi
from carolina with father and he had been father's body servant all the time that he was
raising and training simon, ringo's father, to take over when he (joby) got too old, which
was to have been some years yet except for the war. so simon went with father; he was
still in tennessee with the army. we waited for father to begin; we waited so long

watched the road by turns, to get louvinia calmed down in case it would be late before
he got back. it was late; she had followed us up to bed and we had slipped out again; we
were just passing joby's cabin when the door opened and loosh kind of surged up out of
the darkness right beside us. he was almost close enough for me to have touched him and
he did not see us at all; all of a sudden he was just kind of hanging there against the
lighted doorway like he had been cut out of tin in the act of running and was inside the
cabin and the door shut back again almost before we knew what we had seen. and
when we looked in the window he was standing in front of the fire, with his clothes torn an

the lamp with the bible open on her lap and her neck arched to look at us across her
spectacles. "they're coming here!" i said. "they're coming to set us free!" "what?" she said.

"loosh saw them! they're just down the road. it's general sherman and he's going
to make us all free!" and we watching her, waiting to see who she would send for to take
down the musket--whether it would be joby, because he was the oldest, or loosh,
because he had seen them and would know what to shoot at. then she shouted, too, and
her voice was strong and loud as louvinia's:

was like i was looking at our place and suddenly the house and stable and cabins and
trees and all were gone and i was looking at a place flat and empty as the sideboard,
and it was growing darker and darker, and then all of a sudden i wasn't looking at it; i was
there--a sort of frightened drove of little tiny figures moving on it; they were father and
granny and joby and louvinia and loosh and philadelphy and ringo and me--and then
ringo made a choked sound and i was looking at the road, and there in the middle of it,
sitting on a bright bay horse and looking at the house through a field glass, was a yankee.
for a long time we just lay there looking at him. i don't know what we had expected to
see, but we knew what he was at once; i remember thinking, "he looks just like a man,"

around the curve. we didn't hear anything else, maybe because of our own breathing or
maybe because we were not expecting to hear anything else. we didn't look again
either; we were too busy cocking the musket. we had practiced before, once or twice

joby and loosh were in the kitchen. joby was sitting behind the stove with a plate
on his knees, eating. loosh was sitting on the wood box, still, with the two shovels between
his knees, but i didn't see him at first because of ringo's shadow. the lamp was on the
table, and i could see the shadow of ringo's head bent over and his arm working back
and forth, and louvinia standing between us and the lamp, her hands on her hips and her
elbows spread and her shadow filling the room. "clean that chimney

one dimension like a bolster case, taller than a bolster case in her nightgown; silent as a
ghost on her bare feet which were the same color as the shadow in which she stood so
that she seemed to have no feet, the twin rows of her toenails lying weightless and faint
and still as two rows of faintly soiled feathers on the floor about a foot below the hem of
her nightgown as if they were not connected with her. she came and shoved joby aside
and stooped to lift the trunk. "git away, nigger," she said. joby groaned, then he shoved
louvinia aside.

loosh, who had never let his end down. "if you gonter ride on hit, pick up your feet," he
said. we carried the trunk up to granny's room, and joby was setting it down again, until
granny made him and loosh pull the bed out from the wall and slide the trunk in behind it;
ringo and i helped again. i don't believe it lacked much of weighing a thousand pounds.

"nummine about that," louvinia said. "you do like miss rosa tell you." we went out;
we left granny there beside her bed now well away from the wall and in such an ungainly
position that anyone would have known at once that something was concealed, even if
the trunk which ringo and i as well as joby believed now to weigh at least a thousand
pounds, could have been hidden. as it was, the bed merely underlined it. then granny
shut the door behind us and then ringo and i stopped dead in the hall and looked at one
another. since i could remember, there had never been a key to any door, inside or
outside, about the house. yet we had heard a key turn in the lock.

we put on our sunday clothes by lamplight, we ate breakfast by it and listened to louvinia
above stairs as she removed from granny's and my beds the linen we had slept under last
night and rolled up ringo's pallet and carried them downstairs; in the first beginning of day
we went out to where loosh and joby had already put the mules into the wagon and
where joby stood in what he called his sunday clothes too--the old frock coat, the napless
beaver hat of father's. when granny came out (still in the black silk and the bonnet as if
she had slept in them, passed the night standing rigidly erect with her hand on the key
which she had produced from we knew not where and locked her door for the first time
ringo and i knew of) with her shawl over her shoulders and carrying her parasol and the

quietly, "gawn, pappy. get on." they went on; granny and i stood at the end of the
gallery and heard them drag the trunk out, then shove the bed back where it had been
yesterday; we heard them on the stairs with the trunk--the slow, clumsy, coffinsounding
thumps. then they came out onto the gallery.

we drove away. loosh had already disappeared, but louvinia still stood at the end of the
gallery with father's old hat on top of her head rag. then i stopped looking back, though i
could feel ringo beside me on the trunk turning every few yards, even after we were

because at least once a day we stopped at houses on the road and ate with them, and

third night granny was in the wagon and joby and ringo and i were under the wagon

and took the gun away from joby and they lit a pine knot and we saw the gray.

you run with a stick of wood balanced on your palm; and the last ones came out of the

mules came out of the dust, soaring like hawks, with two men on them and two more just
falling backward over the mules' tails and the fifth man already running, too, and the two
that were on their backs in the road getting up with little scraps of cut leather sticking to
them like a kind of black shavings in a sawmill. the three of them went off across the field
after the mules, and then we heard the pistols away off like striking a handful of matches
at one time, and joby still sitting on the seat with his mouth still open and the ends of the
cut reins in his hands, and granny still standing in the wagon with the bent umbrella lifted
and hollering at ringo and me while we jumped out of the wagon and ran across the
road.

were looking at the house, it was like that day when we ran across the pasture and the
house would not seem to get any nearer at all. we never saw the wagon at all; it was
father that saw it; it was coming up the road from jefferson, with granny sitting thin and
straight on the seat with mrs. compson's rose cuttings wrapped in a new piece of paper in
her hand, and joby yelling and lashing the strange horses, and father stopping us at the
gate with his hat raised while the wagon went in first. granny didn't say a word. she just
looked at ringo and me, and went on, with us coming behind, and she didn't stop at the
house. the wagon went on into the orchard and stopped by the hole where we had dug
the trunk up, and still granny didn't say a word; it was father that got down and got into
the wagon and took up one end of the trunk and said over his shoulder, "jump

nailed by one edge to a rafter and hanging down to make two rooms. joby was waiting
with the wagon when granny came out with mrs. compson's hat on, and got into the
wagon and told ringo to open the parasol and took up the reins. then we all stopped and
watched joby stick something into the wagon beneath the quilts; it was the barrel and the

reckon she had seen him, too, because she already had her sunbonnet on. they looked at
us once, then granny went on, too, walking straight, not fast, down the path toward the
lot, with the lieutenant behind her on the horse. we could see his shoulders and his head,
and now and then his hand and arm, but we couldn't hear what he was saying. "i reckon
this does complete hit," ringo said.

standing at the fence that joby and i had just finished--granny straight and still, with her
sunbonnet on and the shawl drawn tight over her shoulders where she had her arms
folded in it so that she looked littler than anybody i could remember, like during the four
years she hadn't got any older or weaker, but just littler and littler and straighter and
straighter and more and more indomitable; and the lieutenant beside her with one hand
on his hip and waving a whole handful of letters at granny's face with the other.

like he got all we ever wrote there," ringo said. the soldiers' horses were all
tied along the fence; they were inside the pen now, and they and joby and ab snopes
had the forty-odd old mules and the nineteen new ones hemmed into the corner. the
mules were still trying to break out, only it didn't look like that. it looked like every one of
them was trying to keep the big burned smear where granny and ringo had blotted the
u. s. brand turned so that the lieutenant would have to look at it.

move. granny wasn't even looking at him; it was ringo and me that watched him fold the
letters that granny and ringo had written and put them carefully into his pocket. he still
talked quiet, like he was tired: "all right, boys. rope them together and haze them out of
there."
"the gate is a quarter of a mile from here," a soldier said.


"throw down some fence," the lieutenant said. they began to throw down the
fence that joby and i had worked two months on. the lieutenant took a pad from his
pocket, and he went to the fence and laid the pad on the rail and took out a pencil. then
he looked back at granny; he still talked quiet: "i believe you said the name now is rosa
millard?" "yes," granny said.

he still talked quiet, like when somebody is sick in a room. "we are under orders to pay for
all property damaged in the process of evacuation," he said. "this is a voucher on the
quartermaster at memphis for ten dollars.

he cursed again, not loud and not at anybody or anything. "listen. i don't say

grandmother. and if in about four months the auditor should find a warrant in the records
for a thousand dollars to mrs. rosa millard, i would have to make it good. do you see?"

"yes," granny said. "you need not worry." then they were gone. granny and ringo
and joby and i stood there and watched them drive the mules up across the pasture and
out of sight. we had forgot about ab snopes until he said, "well, hit looks like . . . that's all
they are to hit. but you still got that ere hundred-odd that are out on receipt, provided

the lieutenant wrote on the pad and tore the sheet out and came back to granny.

for that much anyway. so  i bid you, one and all, good day a

after a while granny said:


"joby, put those rails back up." i reckon ringo and i were both waiting for her to tell
us to help joby, but she didn't. she just said "come," and turned and went on, not toward
the cabin but across the pasture toward the road. we didn't know where we were going
until we reached the church. she went straight up the aisle to the chancel and stood
there until we came up. "kneel down," she said.

we knelt in the empty church. she was small between us, little; she talked quiet, not
loud, not fast and not slow; her voice sounded quiet and still, but strong and clear: "i have
sinned. i have stolen, and

no more to do with it than it had in her dealings with the yankees; she just turned and
looked at me, and then i began to cry. i would be sixteen years old before another year
was out, yet i sat there in the wagon, crying. i didn't even know when she freed her arm.
and then she was out of the wagon, standing there looking at me in the gray rain and the
gray darkening light.

"it's for all of us," she said. "for john and you and ringo and joby and louvinia. so
we will have something when john comes back home. you never cried when you knew
he was going into a battle, did you? and now i am taking no risk; i am a woman. even
yankees do not harm old women. you and ringo stay here until i call you."

now; it was like the bare trees themselves were dissolving slow and steady and cold into
the end of the december day. we rode in single file, in our wet clothes and in the wet
ammonia steam of the mules.

the pen was just like the one he and ringo and joby and i had built at home, only
smaller and better hidden; i reckon he had got the idea from ours. we stopped at the wet
rails; they were still new enough for the split sides to be still yellow with sap, and on the far
side of the pen there was something that looked like a yellow cloud in the twilight, until it
moved. and then we saw that it was a claybank stallion and three mares.

one motion, with louvinia's face hanging over us and still scolding, and joby in the
chimney corner where louvinia had made him get up out of granny's chair. and then
somebody was pulling at me, and i thought i was fighting ab snopes again, and then it
was the rain in father's beard and clothes that i smelled. but uncle buck was still hollering,
and father holding me, and ringo and i held to him, and then it was drusilla kneeling and
holding me and ringo, and we could smell the rain in her hair, too, while she was hollering
at uncle buck to hush. father's hand was hard;

"yes, by godfrey! not only tracked him down and caught him but brought back
the actual proof of it to where rosa millard could rest quiet." "the which?" joby hollered.
"fotch back the which?" "hush! hush!" drusilla said. "that's all done, all finished. you, uncle

and drusilla rode up to that old compress, the first thing we see was that murdering
scoundrel pegged out on the door to it like a coon hide, all except the right hand. 'and if
anybody wants to see that, too,' i told john sartoris, 'just let them ride into jefferson and

the third letter did not come to us at all. it came to mrs. compson. drusilla and father were
home then. it was in the spring and the war was over now, and we were busy getting the
cypress and oak out of the bottom to build the house and drusilla working with joby and
ringo and father and me like another man, with her hair shorter than it had been at
hawkhurst and her face sunburned from riding in the weather and her body thin from living
like soldiers lived. after granny died ringo and louvinia and i all slept in the cabin, but
after father came ringo and louvinia moved back to the other cabin with joby and now
father and i slept on ringo's and my pallet and drusilla slept in the bed behind the quilt

reason can you name why she should choose to conceal herself down there in the woods
all day long, lifting heavy weights like logs and--"

then i went away. i filled the bucket at the spring and went back to the log-yard
where drusilla and ringo and joby were feeding the bandsaw and the blindfolded mule
going round and round in the sawdust. and then joby kind of made a sound and we all
stopped and looked and there was mrs. habersham, with three of the others kind of
peeping out from behind her with their eyes round and bright, looking at drusilla standing
there in the sawdust and shavings, in her dirty sweated overalls and shirt and brogans, with
her face sweat-streaked with sawdust and her short hair yellow with it. "i am martha

because i was just fifteen; i still didn't know what it was all about; i just stood there and

kind of waving her hand at the mules that hadn't stopped and at joby and ringo
goggling at her and the three others still peeping around her at drusilla. "--to offer you not
only our help, but our sympathy."

"oh. oh. oh," standing there, and then she was running. she began to run like a deer, that
starts to run and then decides where it wants to go; she turned right in the air and came
toward me, running light over the logs and planks, with her mouth open, saying "john,
john" not loud; for a minute it was like she thought i was father until she waked up and

motionless yet still furious with movement. "is that what you think too?" she said. then she
was gone. every now and then i could see her footprints, spaced and fast, just inside the
woods, but when i came out of the bottom, i couldn't see her. but the surreys and buggies
were still in front of the cabin and i could see mrs. compson and the other ladies on the
porch, looking out across the pasture toward the bottom, so i did not go there. but before i
came to the other cabin, where louvinia and joby and ringo lived, i saw louvinia come
up the hill from the spring, carrying her cedar water bucket and singing. then she went into
the cabin and the singing stopped short off and so i knew where drusilla was. but i didn't
hide. i went to the window and looked in and saw drusilla just turning from where she had
been leaning her head in her arms on the mantel when louvinia came in with the water
bucket and a gum twig in her mouth and father's old hat on top of her head rag. drusilla
was crying. "t

me at the mill, and father in town; we wouldn't see him from the time he would ride away
in the morning until when he would get back, sometimes late at night. because they were
strange times then. for four years we had lived for just one thing, even the women and
children who could not fight: to get yankee troops out of the country; we thought that
when that happened, it would be all over. and now that had happened, and then before
the summer began i heard father say to drusilla,

suppose i cannot call it surprise. but it is still a shock." so father came out too and we went
down to the spring and found drusilla hiding behind the big beech, crouched down like
she was trying to hide the skirt from father even while he raised her up. "what's a dress?" he
said. "it don't matter. come. get up, soldier."

whipped; like in the dress she could neither fight back nor run away. and so she didn't
come down to the log-yard any more, and now that father and i slept in the cabin with
joby and ringo, i didn't even see drusilla except at mealtime. and we were busy getting
the timber out, and now everybody was talking about the election and how father had
told the two burdens before all the men in town that the election would never be held with
cash benbow or any other nigger in it and how the burdens had dared him to stop it. and
besides, the other cabin would be full of jefferson ladies all day; you would have thought
that drusilla was mrs. habersham's daughter and not aunt louis

and odorous old names, for though it was october no rain had come yet and hence no
frost to bring (or leave behind) the first half-warm half-chill nights of indian summer--the

anything and everything except a lawyer. then drusilla and aunt jenny rose and left us

there last to borrow money to liquidate his first private railroad bonds. then i stood again

stool though i didn't look in to see. instead i stood at the diningroom window and drank
the coffee which louvinia brought me, then i went to the stable; i saw joby watching me
