[CHARACTER]

the [CHARACTER]'s experience of love moves him from
placid youth to elation to frustrated loneliness as he explores
the threshold between childhood and adulthood. like the narrator
of "an encounter," he yearns to experience new places and things,
but he is also like eveline and other adult characters who grapple
with the conflict between everyday life and the promise of love.
he wants to see himself as an adult, so he dismisses his distracting
schoolwork as "child's play" and expresses his intense emotions
in dramatic, romantic gestures. however, his inability to actively
pursue what he desires traps him in a child's world. his dilemma
suggests the hope of youth stymied by the unavoidable realities
of dublin life. the [CHARACTER] is the last of the first-person
narrators in dubliners, all of whom are young boys.
