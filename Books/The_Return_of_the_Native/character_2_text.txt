would—and showed his imperfections, she shivered thus. but it was over in a second, and she loved on. she knew that he trifled with her; but she loved on. she scattered the half-burnt brands, went indoors immediately, and up to her bedroom without a light. amid the rustles which denoted her to be undressing in the darkness other heavy breaths frequently came; and the same kind of shudder occasionally moved through her when, ten minutes later, she lay on her bed asleep.




7—queen of night

eustacia vye was the raw material of a divinity. on olympus she would have done well with a little preparation. she had the passions and instincts which make a model goddess, that is, those which make not quite a model woman. had it been possible for the earth and mankind to be entirely in her grasp for a while, she had handled the distaff, the spindle, and the shears at her own free will, few in the world would have noticed the change of government. there would have been the same inequality of lot, the sam

across the upper part of her head she wore a thin fillet of black velvet, restraining the luxuriance of her shady hair, in a way which added much to this class of majesty by irregularly clouding her forehead. “nothing can embellish a beautiful face more than a narrow band drawn over the brow,” says richter. some of the neighbouring girls wore coloured ribbon for the same purpose, and sported metallic ornaments elsewhere; but if anyone suggested coloured ribbon and metallic ornaments to eustacia vye she laughed and went on.
why did a woman of this sort live on egdon heath? budmouth was her native place, a fashionable seaside resort at that date. she was the daughter of the bandmaster of a regiment which had been quartered there—a corfiote by birth, and a fine musician—who met his future wife during her trip thither with her father the captain, a man of good family. the marriage was scarcely in accord with the old man’s wishes, for the bandmaster’s pockets were as light as his occup

oice of the heath did not alarm him, for that was familiar. the thornbushes which arose in his path from time to time were less satisfactory, for they whistled gloomily, and had a ghastly habit after dark of putting on the shapes of jumping madmen, sprawling giants, and hideous cripples. lights were not uncommon this evening, but the nature of all of them was different from this. discretion rather than terror prompted the boy to turn back instead of passing the light, with a view of asking miss eustacia vye to let her servant accompany him home.
when the boy had reascended to the top of the valley he found the fire to be still burning on the bank, though lower than before. beside it, instead of eustacia’s solitary form, he saw two persons, the second being a man. the boy crept along under the bank to ascertain from the nature of the proceedings if it would be prudent to interrupt so splendid a creature as miss eustacia on his poor trivial account.
after listening under the bank for some minutes

 daylight; the turves, standing upon him with the heather upwards, looked precisely as if they were growing. he crept along again, and the turves upon his back crept with him. had he approached without any covering the chances are that he would not have been perceived in the dusk; approaching thus, it was as though he burrowed underground. in this manner he came quite close to where the two were standing.
“wish to consult me on the matter?” reached his ears in the rich, impetuous accents of eustacia vye. “consult me? it is an indignity to me to talk so—i won’t bear it any longer!” she began weeping. “i have loved you, and have shown you that i loved you, much to my regret; and yet you can come and say in that frigid way that you wish to consult with me whether it would not be better to marry thomasin. better—of course it would be. marry her—she is nearer to your own position in life than i am!”
“yes, yes; that’s very well,” said wildeve peremptorily. “but we must look a

“do you press me to tell?”
“yes, i must know. i see i have been too ready to believe in my own power.”
“well, the immediate reason was that the license would not do for the place, and before i could get another she ran away. up to that point you had nothing to do with it. since then her aunt has spoken to me in a tone which i don’t at all like.”
“yes, yes! i am nothing in it—i am nothing in it. you only trifle with me. heaven, what can i, eustacia vye, be made of to think so much of you!”
“nonsense; do not be so passionate.... eustacia, how we roved among these bushes last year, when the hot days had got cool, and the shades of the hills kept us almost invisible in the hollows!”
she remained in moody silence till she said, “yes; and how i used to laugh at you for daring to look up to me! but you have well made me suffer for that since.”
“yes, you served me cruelly enough until i thought i had found someone fairer than you. a bles

zes that blew around his mouth in that walk carried off upon them the accents of a commination.
he entered the van, where there was a fire in a stove. without lighting his candle he sat down at once on the three-legged stool, and pondered on what he had seen and heard touching that still-loved one of his. he uttered a sound which was neither sigh nor sob, but was even more indicative than either of a troubled mind.
“my tamsie,” he whispered heavily. “what can be done? yes, i will see that eustacia vye.”




10—a desperate attempt at persuasion

the next morning, at the time when the height of the sun appeared very insignificant from any part of the heath as compared with the altitude of rainbarrow, and when all the little hills in the lower levels were like an archipelago in a fog-formed aegean, the reddleman came from the brambled nook which he had adopted as his quarters and ascended the slopes of mistover knap.
though these shaggy hills were apparently so solitary, several keen round

and with its odours. he might be said to be its product. his eyes had first opened thereon; with its appearance all the first images of his memory were mingled, his estimate of life had been coloured by it: his toys had been the flint knives and arrow-heads which he found there, wondering why stones should “grow” to such odd shapes; his flowers, the purple bells and yellow furze: his animal kingdom, the snakes and croppers; his society, its human haunters. take all the varying hates felt by eustacia vye towards the heath, and translate them into loves, and you have the heart of clym. he gazed upon the wide prospect as he walked, and was glad.
to many persons this egdon was a place which had slipped out of its century generations ago, to intrude as an uncouth object into this. it was an obsolete thing, and few cared to study it. how could this be otherwise in the days of square fields, plashed hedges, and meadows watered on a plan so rectangular that on a fine day they looked like silver gridir

heath towards mistover.
it was an hour and a half later when he again appeared at the garden gate. the shutters of the house were closed, and christian cantle, who had been wheeling manure about the garden all day, had gone home. on entering he found that his mother, after waiting a long time for him, had finished her meal.
“where have you been, clym?” she immediately said. “why didn’t you tell me that you were going away at this time?”
“i have been on the heath.”
“you’ll meet eustacia vye if you go up there.”
clym paused a minute. “yes, i met her this evening,” he said, as though it were spoken under the sheer necessity of preserving honesty.
“i wondered if you had.”
“it was no appointment.”
“no; such meetings never are.”
“but you are not angry, mother?”
“i can hardly say that i am not. angry? no. but when i consider the usual nature of the drag which causes men of promise to disappoint the world i feel uneasy.”
“you deserve credit for the feeling, mo

ng towards him. these half-silent sittings were far from uncommon with them now. at last yeobright made a beginning of what was intended to strike at the whole root of the matter.
“five days have we sat like this at meals with scarcely a word. what’s the use of it, mother?”
“none,” said she, in a heart-swollen tone. “but there is only too good a reason.”
“not when you know all. i have been wanting to speak about this, and i am glad the subject is begun. the reason, of course, is eustacia vye. well, i confess i have seen her lately, and have seen her a good many times.”
“yes, yes; and i know what that amounts to. it troubles me, clym. you are wasting your life here; and it is solely on account of her. if it had not been for that woman you would never have entertained this teaching scheme at all.”
clym looked hard at his mother. “you know that is not it,” he said.
“well, i know you had decided to attempt it before you saw her; but that would have ended in intentions. it w

don’t press that, eustacia. will you marry me?”
“i cannot tell.”
“now—never mind paris; it is no better than other spots. promise, sweet!”
“you will never adhere to your education plan, i am quite sure; and then it will be all right for me; and so i promise to be yours for ever and ever.”
clym brought her face towards his by a gentle pressure of the hand, and kissed her.
“ah! but you don’t know what you have got in me,” she said. “sometimes i think there is not that in eustacia vye which will make a good homespun wife. well, let it go—see how our time is slipping, slipping, slipping!” she pointed towards the half-eclipsed moon.
“you are too mournful.”
“no. only i dread to think of anything beyond the present. what is, we know. we are together now, and it is unknown how long we shall be so; the unknown always fills my mind with terrible possibilities, even when i may reasonably expect it to be cheerful.... clym, the eclipsed moonlight shines upon your face with a

p words are spoken, and a crisis ensues

when yeobright was not with eustacia he was sitting slavishly over his books; when he was not reading he was meeting her. these meetings were carried on with the greatest secrecy.
one afternoon his mother came home from a morning visit to thomasin. he could see from a disturbance in the lines of her face that something had happened.
“i have been told an incomprehensible thing,” she said mournfully. “the captain has let out at the woman that you and eustacia vye are engaged to be married.”
“we are,” said yeobright. “but it may not be yet for a very long time.”
“i should hardly think it would be yet for a very long time! you will take her to paris, i suppose?” she spoke with weary hopelessness.
“i am not going back to paris.”
“what will you do with a wife, then?”
“keep a school in budmouth, as i have told you.”
“that’s incredible! the place is overrun with schoolmasters. you have no special qualifications. what possible cha

d i have not parted in anger; we have parted in a worse way. it is not a passionate quarrel that would have broken my heart; it is the steady opposition and persistence in going wrong that he has shown. o thomasin, he was so good as a little boy—so tender and kind!”
“he was, i know.”
“i did not think one whom i called mine would grow up to treat me like this. he spoke to me as if i opposed him to injure him. as though i could wish him ill!”
“there are worse women in the world than eustacia vye.”
“there are too many better that’s the agony of it. it was she, thomasin, and she only, who led your husband to act as he did—i would swear it!”
“no,” said thomasin eagerly. “it was before he knew me that he thought of her, and it was nothing but a mere flirtation.”
“very well; we will let it be so. there is little use in unravelling that now. sons must be blind if they will. why is it that a woman can see from a distance what a man cannot see close? clym must do as he will
