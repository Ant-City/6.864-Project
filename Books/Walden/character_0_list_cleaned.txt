[CHARACTER] - 
 amateur naturalist, essayist, lover of solitude,
and poet. thoreau was a student and protege of the great american
philosopher and essayist ralph waldo emerson, and his construction
of a hut on emerson's land at walden pond is a fitting symbol of the
intellectual debt that thoreau owed to emerson. strongly influenced
by transcendentalism, thoreau believed in the perfectibility of
mankind through education, self-exploration, and spiritual awareness. this
view dominates almost all of thoreau's writing, even the most mundane
and trivial, so that even woodchucks and ants take on allegorical
meaning. a former teacher, thoreau's didactic impulse transforms a
work that begins as economic reflection and nature writing to something
that ends far more like a sermon. although he values poverty theoretically,
he seems a bit of a snob when talking with actual poor people. his style
underscores this point, since his writing is full of classical references
and snippets of poetry that the educated would grasp but the underprivileged 
would not.
