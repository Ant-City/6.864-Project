the 
house 
on 
mango 
street 

we  didn't always  live  on  mango street.  before  that 
we lived on loomis on the third floor, and before that we 
lived on keeler.  before keeler it was  paulina, and before 
that i can't remember. but what i remember most is mov­
ing a lot.  each  time it seemed there'd be one more of us. 
by  the time we  got to mango street we  were six-mama, 
papa, carlos,  kiki,  my  sister nenny and me. 

the house on mango street is ours, and we don't have 
to pay rent to anybody, or share the yard with the people 
downstairs, or be careful not to make too much noise, and 
there isn't a landlord banging on the ceiling with a broom. 
but even so,  it's not the house we'd  thought we'd  get.

where do you live?  she ask.ed. 
there, i said pointing up to the third hoor. 
you live  there' 
there.  i had to look to where she pointed-the third 
hoor, the paint peeling, wooden bars papa had nailed on 
the windows  so  we  wouldn't  fall  out.  you  live there'  the 
way  she  said  it made  me  feel  like  nothing.  there.  i  lived 
there.  i nodded.
 

i knew then i had to have a house. a real house. one
 
i  could  point  to.  but  this  isn't  it.  the  house  on  mango
 
street isn't it.  for the time being,  mama says. temporary,
 
says  papa.  but i know  how  those things go.

. . . . and that's why we  moved into the house on mango 
screet. far away,  on the other side of town. 

they always told us that one day we would move into 
i. bouse, a real house that would be ours for always so we 
wouldn't  have  to  move  each  year.  and  our house  would 
have running water and pipes that worked.  and inside it 
would have real stairs,  not hallway stairs,  but stairs inside 
like the houses on t.v. and we'd have a basement and at 
1casl three washrooms

 so when we took a bath we wouldn't 
have to tell everybody. our house would be white with trees 
around it,  a  great  big  yard  and  grass  growing  without a 
fence. this was the house papa talked about when he held 
a lottery ticket and this was  the house mama dreamed up 
in  the stories she told us before we  went to  bed. 

but the  house on  mango street is  not the  way  they 
told it at all.  it's small and red with tight steps in front and 
windows  so  small  you'd  think  they  were  holding  their 
breath. bricks are crumbling in places, and the front door 
is so swollen you have to push hard to get in. there is  no 
front yard, only four little elms the city planted by

 the curb. 
out  back  is  a  small  garage  for  the  car we  don't  own  yet 
and a small yard that looks smaller between the two build­
ings  on  either  side.  there  are  stairs  in  our  house,  but 
they're ordinary hallway stairs, and the house has only one 
washroom. everybody has to share a bedroom-mama and 
papa, carlos and kiki,  me and nenny. 

once when we were living on loomis, a nun from my 
school passed by and saw  me playing out front.  the laun­
dromat  downstairs  had  been  boarded  up because  it  had

hairs 

everybody in our family has different hair. my papa's 
hair is  like a broom, all  up in  the air. and me,  my  hair is 
lazy. it never obeys barrettes or bands. carlos' hair is  thick 
and straight.  he doesn't need  to comb it.  nenny's hair is 
slippery-slides out of your  hand.  and  kiki,  who  is  the 
youngest,  has  hair like fur. 

but  my  mother's  hair,  my  mother's  hair,  like  little \

she  pinned  it  in  pincurls  all  day,  sweet  to  put your  nose

the first job 

it wasn't as if i didn't want to work.  i did.  i had even 
gone to  the  social  security office  the  month before to  get 
my social security number.  i needed money. the catholic 
high school cost a lot, and papa said nobody went to public 
school unless you wanted to turn out bad. 

i  thought  i'd  find  an  easy  job,  the  kind  other  kids 
had, working in the dime store or maybe a  hotdog stand. 
and though i hadn't started looking yet, i thought i might 
the week after next. but when i came home that afternoon, 
all  wet because tito had  pushed  me  into  the  open water 
hydrant-only i  had sort of let him-mama called me in 
the kitchen before i could even go and change, and aunt

my  papa. his thick hands and thick shoes, who wakes 
up tired in the dark, who combs his hair with water, drinks 
his coffee, and is  gone before we  wake, today is  sitting on

the water was  warm and tasted like  metal.  lucy laughed. 
rachel  too.  we  took  turns being her.  we screamed in  the 
weak voice of a parrot for totchy to come and wash those 
dishes.  it was easy. 

we didn't know. she had been dying such a long time, 

we  forgot.  maybe  she  was  ashamed.  maybe  she  was  em­
barrassed  it  took so  many  years.  the kids  who wanted  to 
be kids  instead of washing dishes and ironing their papa's 
shirts, and  the husband who wanted a  wife again. 

and then she died, my aunt who listened to my poems. 
and  then we  began  to dream the dreams.

better if we  chanred the game a little.  if we  pretended we
 
were mr.  benny, or his wife blanca, or ruthie, or anybody
 
we  knew. 

i don't know why we picked her. maybe we were bored 
that day.  maybe  we  rot  tired.  we  liked  my  aunt.  she  lis­
tened  to  our  stories.

i walked fast.  it made your blood freeze to have somebody 
look  at you  like  that. somebody looked  at me.  somebody 
looked.  but  his  kind,  his  ways.  he  is  a  punk,  papa  says,

and  then  his  girlfriend  came.  lois  i  heard  him  call

her  sometimes  running  to  the  store  for  him.  and  once 
when she was  standing next to me at mr.  benny's grocery 
she  was  barefoot, and  i saw  her barefoot baby toenails all

i want a house on a hill like the ones with the gardens 
where  papa  works.  we  go  on  sundays,  papa's  day  off.  i 
used to  go.  i don't anymore. you don't like to go out with 
us,  papa says.  getting too  old? getting too stuck-up,  says 
nenny.  i  don't tell  them i am ashamed-all of us  staring
