ality, then, or any code of ethics based on how other human beings
should be treated in song of solomon, does not grow from roots of christianity.
yet we can conclude that certain actions are right and others wrong. the
dualism develops when morrison continues to blur the line between one
person’s right and another persons wrong. she refuses to allow us to be comfortable
in our conclusions because the evidence for such evaluations keeps
shifting. the circumstances surrounding the death of ruth foster dead’s
father are a prime example of this. did she caress his corpse, as macon dead
claims? did macon kill her father, as ruth claims? who is right or wrong?
both and neither. when we consequently try to fit the actions of milkman
dead into a pattern, we arrive at the same ambiguous conclusions. should
all of his former trespasses be forgiven just because he learns to fly? was
he right in emotionally abusing and neglecting hagar? wrong in telling
macon about corinthians’s affair with porter

rd world of illicit gossip that morrison is so fond of evoking in her
fiction. in its representation of members of the dead family, morrison’s novel
not only ridicules them for their class pretensions, but also actively humiliates
them by insisting on their family pathology and by exposing the shameful
family secrets that haunt them.
intent on locating the familial and cultural sources of black male pride,
the narrative initially rejects the false pride of milkman’s maternal grandfather,
dr. foster, which is based on a mimicry of white supremacist—including
antiblack racist—attitudes and behavior. the “most respected” black man
in the city while ruth is growing up, dr. foster, for whom doctor street is
named, is “worshipped” by the black residents. but while members of the
black community take pride in the doctor, he does not “give a damn” about
them. an assimilated black who occupies a superior class position, the doctor
views those below him as objects of contempt. that

difference. the doctor’s own unacknowledged status anxiety about
being categorized as racially stigmatized becomes apparent in his response
to his grandchildren. when he delivers his granddaughters, magdalene and
first corinthians, he is interested only in their skin color, and he would have
“disowned” milkman for his darker skin, according to macon (71).
in a classic countershaming strategy, the narrative uses macon’s angry,
cynical voice to shame the middle-class, light-skinned dr. foster. “[t]he

pompous donkey found out what it was like to have to be sick and pay
another donkey to make you well,” remarks macon, who describes the dying
dr. foster as an object of contempt and disgust (72). “couldn’t move, holes
were forming in his scalp. and he just lay there in that bed where your mother
still sleeps and then he died there. helpless, fat stomach, skinny arms and
legs, looking like a white rat” (73). acting out

a classic turning-of-the-tables
script, the narrative portrays the proud, socially superior and contemptuous
dr. foster as the degenerate, stigmatized other and interprets his light skin
as a mark of his pathological difference.
just as the narrative rejects the false pride of dr. foster, so it rejects the
arrogance of macon dead. a representative of the upwardly mobile, selfmade
black capitalist class, macon, in his “drive for wealth” (28), assumes
a white-identified role as he actively exploits poor blacks in the southside
area of town where he is a slum landlord. a character readers love to hate,
macon has been described as the “most hateful” character in the novel, as
a “[c]old, objective, and calculating” man, and as an “acquisitive” individual

indeed, ruth later tells a markedly different version of this event—the “odiousness”
remains (17), and some readers may feel vicarious shame-disgust as
they are positioned as curious observers of this voyeuristic scene, which hints
at ruth’s incestuous, and necrophilic, attachment to her dead father. after
macon witnesses this scene, he becomes suspicious of ruth. while he knows
that his daughters are his own children—for dr. foster would not have been
concerned about their skin color unless they were fathered by macon—he
begins to read new meaning into the fact that dr. foster delivered ruth’s
babies. “i’m not saying that they had contact. but there’s lots of things a man
can do to please a woman, even if he can’t fuck. whether or not, the fact is
she was in that bed sucking his fingers, and if she’d do that when he was dead,
what’d she do when he was alive?” that contempt can lead to a desire to rid

the civilizing—of her community” and she should have been “a prize for a
professional man of color.” but despite her education and class privileges,
she remains unmarried, for such men prefer wives unlike the “elegant” corinthians,
who is accustomed to black middle-class life and thus lacks the
necessary “ambition,” “hunger,” and “hustle” such men look for in a wife (188).
the granddaughter of the distinguished dr. foster, the forty-four-year-old
corinthians ends up working as the maid of a white woman, the state poet
laureate, and she becomes romantically involved with the southside yardman,
porter. the narrative deliberately brings together the elegant corinthians
and porter, individuals who occupy opposing sites in the black social
hierarchy, as it examines the issue of class and shame in the construction of
african-american identities, and it also, in its initial description of porter,
reproduces the cultura

e in common with her type.
it is true that the biblical ruth is known for her loyalty and that morrison’s
ruth is loyal to the memory of her father; however, the loyalty of the biblical
ruth is of a very different nature. blood does not define it; she chooses to be
loyal to her poverty-stricken and helpless mother-in-law, naomi. by juxtaposing
the two loyal ruths, morrison uses biblical subtext to emphasize the 
174 judy pocock
dead end of misplaced loyalty. ruth’s loyalty to her father, dr. foster, chains
her to the power of patriarchy, materialism, and assimilation into the dominant
culture of racism.
however, a closer look at the biblical ruth’s narrative and her typological
role provides clues to a deeper reading of milkman’s mother’s character
and her part in morrison’s text. all the biblical naomi’s sons are dead and
she has no grandson, so her ancestral line has been destroyed. alone, without
a husband, naomi faces a future of poverty and loneliness. her widowed

his new name. the maternal body is thus imposed on the already displaced
name of the father which is correlative with the story itself. this matronymic,
as it were, contributes to the initiatory theme by pinioning milkman in a
maternal world from which he must break free, a common element in such
narratives.16 ruth even tries to appropriate the naming of her son more completely
when she suggests that he become a doctor like her father, and adopt
his name, becoming dr. macon foster. but once he learns how he acquired
his nickname, milkman begins to move away from his suffocating mother,
and starts his journey of self-discovery, which is unfortunately complicated
and forestalled by milkman’s identification with his father. milkman’s quest
for his true name is his story; it becomes a process that involves considerable
stripping away of his masculine ego and social identity, and a renunciation of
his father’s solipsism and materialism.

the relationship between names and narrative is established early in the
novel by the subversive processes that bring about the designation of “not
doctor street.” the black community had a different name for what was officially
main’s avenue. since the only black doctor in town, dr. foster, lived
there, it became doctor street; when city officials insisted that it was not doctor
street, the black population responded by calling it not doctor street. this
contest of naming and renaming is symbolic of “a conflict between two kinds
of narrative authority”17 which prevails throughout the novel. there is a corresponding
competition for narrative control between milkman’s mother and
father. as i have noted, ruth’s inappropriate intimacy with her son challenges

ystem of naming her son. her attempt to make him adopt her
father’s name and profession is a pathetic attempt to revive her dead father.
ruth’s obsession becomes the subject of her husband’s confidence to milkman,
a version that she challenges. the tension between macon and ruth is
most forcefully realized in their competing narratives regarding ruth’s relationship
with her dead father. ruth’s morbid adulation of dr. foster (after
whom not doctor street was named) extinguishes any desire macon ever felt
for her. explaining his contempt for and abuse of his wife to milkman, macon
recounts a scene of incestuous necrophilia—his naked wife sucking the fingers
of her father’s corpse. but ruth’s account of the event differs substantially;
although she admits to such a longing for her dead father that she surreptitiously
visits his grave at night, she represents her yearning in more natural
terms, and accuses macon
