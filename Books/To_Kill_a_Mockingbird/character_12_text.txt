of marriage; four years later i was born, and two
years later our mother died from a sudden heart attack. they said it ran in her
family. i did not miss her, but i think jem did. he remembered her clearly, and
sometimes in the middle of a game he would sigh at length, then go off and play
by himself behind the car-house. when he was like that, i knew better than to
bother him.
when i was almost six and jem was nearly ten, our summertime boundaries
(within calling distance of calpurnia) were mrs. henry lafayette dubose’s house
two doors to the north of us, and the radley place three doors to the south. we
were never tempted to break them. the radley place was inhabited by an
unknown entity the mere description of whom was enough to make us behave for
days on end; mrs. dubose was plain hell.
that was the summer dill came to us.
early one morning as we were beginning our day’s play in the back yard, jem and
i heard something next door in miss rachel haverford’s collard patch. we went

“cross in it tonight?” asked dill, not looking up. he was constructing a cigarette
from newspaper and string.
“no, just the lady. don’t light that thing, dill, you’ll stink up this whole end of
town.”
there was a lady in the moon in maycomb. she sat at a dresser combing her hair.
“we’re gonna miss you, boy,” i said. “reckon we better watch for mr. avery?”
mr. avery boarded across the street from mrs. henry lafayette dubose’s house.
besides making change in the collection plate every sunday, mr. avery sat on the
porch every night until nine o’clock and sneezed. one evening we were privileged
to witness a performance by him which seemed to have been his positively last,
for he never did it again so long as we watched. jem and i were leaving miss
rachel’s front steps one night when dill stopped us: “golly, looka yonder.” he
pointed across the street. at first we saw nothing but a kudzu-covered front porch,

jem picked up a rock and threw it jubilantly at the carhouse. running after it, he
called back: “atticus is a gentleman, just like me!”

chapter 11

when we were small, jem and i confined our activities to the southern
neighborhood, but when i was well into the second grade at school and
tormenting boo radley became passe, the business section of maycomb drew us
frequently up the street past the real property of mrs. henry lafayette dubose. it
was impossible to go to town without passing her house unless we wished to walk
a mile out of the way. previous minor encounters with her left me with no desire

for more, but jem said i had to grow up some time.
mrs. dubose lived alone except for a negro girl in constant attendance, two doors
up the street from us in a house with steep front steps and a dog-trot hall. she was
very old; she spent most of each day in bed and the rest of it in a wheelchair. it
was rumored that she kept a csa
