  lys. pardon my lord

i know you two are riuall enemies.

   lys. my lord, i shall reply amazedly,
halfe sleepe, halfe waking. but as yet, i sweare,
i cannot truly say how i came heere.
but as i thinke (for truly would i speake)
and now i doe bethinke me, so it is;
i came with hermia hither. our intent
was to be gone from athens, where we might be
without the perill of the athenian law

   ege. enough, enough, my lord: you haue enough;
i beg the law, the law, vpon his head:
they would have stolne away, they would demetrius,
thereby to haue defeated you and me:
you of your wife, and me of my consent;
of my consent, that she should be your wife

faire helena, in fancy followed me.
but my good lord, i wot not by what not by what power,
(but by some power it is) my loue
to hermia (melted as the snow)
seems to me now as the remembrance of an idle gaude,
which in my childehood i did doat vpon:
and all the faith, the vertue of my heart,

is onely helena. to her, my lord,
was i betroth'd, ere i see hermia,
but like a sickenesse did i loath this food,
but as in health, come to my naturall taste,
now doe i wish it, loue it, long for it,
and will for euermore be true to it

   thes. faire louers, you are fortunately met;
of this discourse we shall heare more anon.
egeus, i will ouer-beare your will;
for in the temple, by and by with vs,
these couples shall eternally be knit.
and for the morning now is something worne,
our purpos'd hunting shall be set aside.

howe easie is a bush suppos'd a beare?

and growes to something of great constancie;
but howsoeuer, strange, and admirable.

your boord, your bed

   the. come now, what maskes, what dances shall
we haue,
to weare away this long age of three houres,
between our after supper, and bed-time?
where is our vsuall manager of mirth?
what reuels are in hand? is there no play,
to ease the anguish of a torturing houre?
