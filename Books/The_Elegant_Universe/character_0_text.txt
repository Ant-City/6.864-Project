ibe  the  surfeit  of  data  being  collected  at  various  atom  smashers
around the world. nevertheless, there was a sense in which veneziano's observation was incomplete.
like memorized formulae used by a student who does not understand their meaning or justification,
euler's  beta-function  seemed  to  work,  but  no  one  knew  why.  it  was  a  formula  in  search  of  an
explanation. this changed in 1970 when the works of yoichiro nambu of the university of chicago,
holger nielsen of the niels bohr institute, and leonard susskind of stanford university revealed the
hitherto-unknown  physics  lurking  behind  euler's  formula.  these  physicists  showed  that  if  one
modeled elementary particles as little, vibrating, one-dimensional strings, their nuclear interactions
could  be  described  exactly  by  euler's  function.  if  the  pieces  of  string  were  small  enough,  they
reasoned, they would still look like point particles, and hence could be consistent with experimental
observations
