[CHARACTER] - 
      a former anarchist editor who served ten years in prison for his activities. hugo is a small, fastidiously clean man with an over-sized head, a "walrus mustache" and black eyes that peer from behind thick spectacles. a "foreign atmosphere" pervades him, hugo bearing the "stamp of an alien radical, a strong resemblance to the type anarchist as portrayed, bomb in hand, in newspaper cartoons." his pipe dream of political liberation allows him to deny his desire to rule over the masses. he is drunk for the entire play, intermittently rousing from his stupor to denounce the crowd, whine for a drink, and make odes to babylon.
