scarcely breathing silence, the absent-minded, soliloquizing hum or

very young, pink and callow, followed nervously, rather abjectly, at the 
director's heels. each of them carried a notebook, in which, whenever

meanwhile, it was a privilege. straight from the horse's mouth into the

tall and rather thin but upright, the director advanced into the room. 
he had a long chin and big rather prominent teeth, just covered, when 
he was not talking, by his full, floridly curved lips. old, young? thirty? 
fifty? fifty-five? it was hard to say. and anyhow the question didn't 
arise; in this year of stability, a. f. 632, it didn't occur to you to ask it.

were distributing largesse. "scores."

lay. 

"my good boy!" the director wheeled sharply round on him. "can't you

"that's the spirit i like!" cried the director, and clapped mr. foster on 
the shoulder. "come along with us, and give these boys the benefit of 
your expert knowledge." 

mr. foster smiled modestly. "with pleasure." they went.

and in effect the sultry darkness into which the students now followed 
him was visible and crimson, like the darkness of closed eyes on a 
summer's afternoon. the bulging flanks of row on receding row and 
tier above tier of bottles glinted with innumerable rubies, and among 
the rubies moved the dim red spectres of men and women with purple 
eyes and all the symptoms of lupus. the hum and rattle of machinery 
faintly stirred the air. 

"give them a few figures, mr. foster," said the director, who was tired 
of talking. 

mr. foster was only too happy to give them a few figures.

he rubbed his hands. for of course, they didn't content themselves 
with merely hatching out embryos: any cow could do that. 
"we also predestine and condition. we decant our babies as socialized 
human beings, as alphas or epsilons, as future sewage workers or fu- 



ture ..." he was going to say "future world controllers," but correcting 
himself, said "future directors of hatcheries," instead. 
the d.h.c. acknowledged the compliment with a smile. 
they were passing metre 320 on rack 11. a young beta-minus me-

"the surrogate goes round slower; therefore passes through the lung 
at longer intervals; therefore gives the embryo less oxygen. nothing 
like oxygen-shortage for keeping an embryo below par." again he 
rubbed his hands. 

"but why do you want to keep the embryo below par?" asked an in- 
genuous student. 

"ass!" said the director, breaking a long silence. "hasn't it occurred to 
you that an epsilon embryo must have an epsilon environment as well 
as an epsilon heredity?" 

it evidently hadn't occurred to him. he was covered with confusion. 
"the lower the caste," said mr. foster, "the shorter the oxygen." the 
first organ affected was the brain. after that the skeleton. at seventy 
per cent of normal oxygen you got dwarfs. at less than seventy eye- 
less monsters.

the embryos had a horror of cold. they were predestined to emigrate 
to the tropics, to be miner and acetate silk spinners and steel workers. 
later on their minds would be made to endorse the judgment of their 
bodies. "we condition them to thrive on heat," concluded mr. foster. 
"our colleagues upstairs will teach them to love it." 
"and that," put in the director sententiously, "that is the secret of hap- 
piness and virtue-liking what you've got to do. all conditioning aims at 
that: making people like their unescapable social destiny." 
in a gap between two tunnels, a nurse was delicately probing with a 
long fine syringe into the gelatinous contents of a passing bottle. the 
students and their guides stood watching her for a few moments in si- 
lence. 

"well, lenina," said mr. foster, when at last she withdrew the syringe 
and straightened herself u

the girl turned with a start. one could see that, for all the lupus and 
the purple eyes, she was uncommonly pretty. 



"henry!" her smile flashed redly at him-a row of coral teeth. 
"charming, charming," murmured the director and, giving her two or 
three little pats, received in exchange a rather deferential smile for 
himself. 

"what are you giving them?" asked mr. foster, making his tone very 
professional. 

"oh, the usual typhoid and sleeping sickness." 

"tropical workers start being inoculated at metre 150," mr. foster ex- 
plained to the students. "the embryos still have gills. we immunize the 
fish against the future man's diseases." then, turning back to lenina,

started to go down to the ground floor.

follow me." 

but the director had looked at his watch. "ten to three," he said. "no 
time for the intellectual embryos, i'm afraid. we must go up to the 
nurseries before the children have finished their afternoon sleep." 
mr. foster was disappointed. "at least one glance at the decanting 
room," he pleaded. 
"very well then." the director smiled indulgently. "just one glance."

the director opened a door. they were in a large bare room, very 
bright and sunny; for the whole of the southern wall was a single win-

white viscose-linen uniform, their hair aseptically hidden under white 
caps, were engaged in setting out bowls of roses in a long row across 
the floor. big bowls, packed tight with blossom. thousands of petals, 
ripe-blown and silkily smooth, like the cheeks of innumerable little

d, the babies at once fell silent, then began to crawl towards 
those clusters of sleek colours, those shapes so gay and brilliant on 
the white pages. as they approached, the sun came out of a momen- 
tary eclipse behind a cloud. the roses flamed up as though with a sud- 
den passion from within; a new and profound significance seemed to 
suffuse the shining pages of the books. from the ranks of the crawling 
babies came little squeals of excitement, gurgles and twitterings of 
pleasure. 

the director rubbed his hands. "excellent!" he said. "it might almost 
have been done on purpose." 

the swiftest crawlers were already at their goal. small hands reached 
out uncertainly, touched, grasped, unpetaling the transfigured roses, 
crumpling the illuminated pages of the books. the director waited until 
all were happily busy. then, "watch carefully," he said. and, lifting his 
hand, he gave the signal. 

the head nurse, who was standing by a switchboard at the other end 
of the room, pressed down

the children started, screamed; their faces were distorted with terror. 

"and now," the director shouted (for the noise was deafening), "now 
we proceed to rub in the lesson with a mild electric shock." 

he waved his hand again, and the head nurse pressed a second lever. 
the screaming of the babies suddenly changed its tone. there was 
something desperate, almost insane, about the sharp spasmodic yelps 
to which they now gave utterance. their little bodies twitched and 
stiffened; their limbs moved jerkily as if to the tug of unseen wires. 

"we can electrify that whole strip of floor,"

bawled the director in ex- 
planation. "but that's enough," he signalled to the nurse. 

the explosions ceased, the bells stopped ringing, the shriek of the si- 
ren died down from tone to tone into silence. the stiffly twitching bod- 
ies relaxed, and what had become the sob and yelp of infant maniacs 
broadened out once more into a normal howl of ordinary terror. 

"offer them the flowers and the books again." 

the nurses obeyed; but at the approach of the roses, at the mere sight 
of those gaily-coloured image

books and loud noises, flowers and electric shocks-already in the in- 
fant mind these couples were compromisingly linked; and after two 
hundred repetitions of the same or a similar lesson would be wedded 
indissolubly. what man has joined, nature is powerless to put asunder.

turned to his nurses. "take them away again." 

still yelling, the khaki babies were loaded on to their dumb-waiters 
and wheeled out, leaving behind them the smell of sour milk and a 
most welcome silence. 



one of the students held up his hand; and though he could see quite 
well why you couldn't have lower-cast people wasting the community's 
time over books, and that there was always the risk of their reading

actories busy. it was decided 
to abolish the love of nature, at any rate among the lower classes; to 
abolish the love of nature, but not the tendency to consume transport. 
for of course it was essential that they should keep on going to the 
country, even though they hated it. the problem was to find an eco- 
nomically sounder reason for consuming transport than a mere affec- 
tion for primroses and landscapes. it was duly found. 

"we condition the masses to hate the country," concluded the director. 
"but simultaneously we condition them to love all country sports. at 
the same time, we see to it that all country sports shall entail the use 
of elaborate apparatus. so that they consume manufactured articles as 
well as transport. hence those electric shocks." 

"i see," said the student, and was silent, lost in admiration. 

there was a silence; then, clearing his throat, "once upon a time," the 
director began, "while our ford was still on earth, there was a little 
boy called reuben rab

the director interrupted himself. "you know what polish is, i suppose?" 

"a dead language." 

"like french and german," added another student, officiously showing 
off his learning. 

"and 'parent'?" questioned the d.h.c. 

there was an uneasy silence. several of the boys blushed. they had 
not yet learned to draw the significant but often very fine distinction 
between smut and pure science. one, at last, had the courage to raise 
a hand. 

"human beings used to be ..." he hesitated; the blood rushed to h

"quite right." the director nodded approvingly. 

"and when the babies were decanted ..." 

'"born,"' came the correction. 

"well, then they were the parents-i mean, not the babies, of course; 
the other ones." the poor boy was overwhelmed with confusion. 

"in brief," the director summed up, "the parents were the father and 
the mother." the smut that was really science fell with a crash into the 
boys' eye-avoiding silence. "mother," he repeated loudly rubbing in the 
science; and, leaning back in his chair, "these," he said gravely, "are 
unpleasant facts; i know it. but then most historical facts are unpleas- 
ant."

"the principle of sleep-teaching, or hypnopaedia, had been discov- 
ered." the d.h.c. made an impressive pause. 

the principle had been discovered; but many, many years were to 
elapse before that principle was usefully applied. 

"the case of little reuben occurred only twenty-three years after our 
ford's first t-model was put on the market." (here the director made a 
sign of the t on his stomach and all the students reverently followed 
suit.) "and yet ..." 

furiously the students scribbled. "hypnopdedia, first used officially in 
a.f. 214. why not before? two reasons, (a) ..." 

"these early experimenters," the d.h.c. was saying, "were on the 
wrong track. they thought that hypnopaedia could be made an instru-

"then which river is the longest, tommy?" 

tommy burst into tears. "i don't know," he howls.) 

that howl, the director made it plain, discouraged the earliest investi- 
gators. the experiments were abandoned. no further attempt was 
made to teach children the length of the nile in their sleep. quite 
rightly. you can't learn a science unless you know what it's all about. 

"whereas, if they'd only started on moral education," said the director, 
leading the way towards the door. the students followed him, desper- 
ately scribbling as they walked and all the way up in the lift. "moral 
education, which ought nev

"silence, silence," whispered a loud speaker as they stepped out at the 
fourteenth floor, and "silence, silence," the trumpet mouths indefati-

even the director himself rose automatically to the tips of their toes. 
they were alphas, of course, but even alphas have been well condi- 
tioned. "silence, silence." all the air of the fourteenth floor was sibilant 
with the categorical imperative. 

fifty yards of tiptoeing brought them to a door which the director cau- 
tiously opened. they stepped over the threshold into the twilight of a 
shuttered dormitory. eighty cots stood in a row against the wall. there

a nurse rose as they entered and came to attention before the direc- 
tor. 

"what's the lesson this afternoon?" he asked. 

"we had elementary sex for the first forty minutes," she answered. 
"but now it's switched over to elementary class consciousness." 

the director walked slowly down the long line of cots. rosy and re- 
laxed with sleep, eighty little boys and girls lay softly breathing. there 
was a whisper under every pillow. the d.h.c. halted and, bending over 
one of the little beds, listened attentively. 

"elementary class consciousness, did you say? let's have it repeated 
a little louder by the trumpet." 

at the end of the room a loud speaker projected from the wall. the di- 
rector walked up to it and pressed a switch.

there was a pause; then the voice began again. 

"alpha children wear grey they work much harder than we do, be-

because i don't work so hard. and then we are much better than the

delta children wear khaki. oh no, i don't want to play with delta chil- 
dren. and epsilons are still worse. they're too stupid to be able ..." 

the director pushed back the switch. the voice was silent. only its 
thin ghost continued to mutter from beneath the eighty pillows.

the students took it down in their little books. straight from the

once more the director touched the switch.

saying, "i'm really awfully glad i'm a beta, because ..."

going out of tune among the lime trees. the air was drowsy with the 
murmur of bees and helicopters. 

the director and his students stood for a short time watching a game 
of centrifugal bumble-puppy. twenty children were grouped in a circle 
round a chrome steel tower. a ball thrown up so as to land on the plat- 
form at the top of the tower rolled down into the interior, fell on a rap- 
idly revolving disk, was hurled through one or other of the numerous 
apertures pierced in the cylindrical casing, and had to be caught.

"charming," the boys politely agreed. but their smile was rather pa-

to be able to watch them now without a touch of contempt. charming? 
but it was just a pair of kids fooling about; that was all. just kids. 

"i always think," the director was continuing in the same rather maud- 
lin tone, when he was interrupted by a loud boo-hooing. 

from a neighbouring shrubbery emerged a nurse, leading by the hand 
a small boy, who howled as he went. an anxious-looking little girl trot- 
ted at her heels. 

"what's the matter?" asked the director. 

the nurse shrugged her shoulders. "nothing much," she answered.

"honestly," put in the anxious-looking little girl, "i didn't mean to hurt 
him or anything. honestly." 

"of course you didn't, dear," said the nurse reassuringly. "and so," she 
went on, turning back to the director, "i'm taking him in to see the as- 
sistant superintendent of psychology. just to see if anything's at all 
abnormal." 



"quite right," said the director. "take him in. you stay here, little girl," 
he added, as the nurse moved away with her still howling charge. 
"what's your name?" 

"polly trotsky." 

"and a very good name too," said the director. "run away now and see 
if you can find some other little boy to play with." 

the child scampered off into the bushes and was lost to sight. 

"exquisite little creature!" said the director, looking after her. then, 
turning to his students, "what i'm going to tell you now," he said,

"not possible!"

"nothing?" 

"in most cases, till they were over twenty years old." 

"twenty years old?" echoed the students in a chorus of loud disbelief. 

"twenty," the director repeated. "i told you that you'd find it incredi-

"but what happened?" they asked. "what were the results?" 

"the results were terrible." a deep resonant voice broke startlingly into 
the dialogue. 

they looked around. on the fringe of the little group stood a stranger- 
a man of middle height, black-haired, with a hooked nose, full red lips, 
eyes very piercing and dark. "terrible," he repeated.

the d.h.c. looked at him nervously. there were those strange rumours 
of old forbidden books hidden in a safe in the controller's study. bibles, 
poetry-ford knew what. 

mustapha mond intercepted his anxious glance and the corners of his

"it's all right, director," he said in a tone of faint derision, "i won't cor-

the d.h.c. was overwhelmed with confusion.

lenina admitted it.

centricity. but henry, with whom, one evening when they were in bed 
together, lenina had rather anxiously discussed her new lover, henry 
had compared poor bernard to a rhinoceros. 

"you can't teach a rhinoceros tricks," he had explained in his brief and 
vigorous style. "some men are almost rhinoceroses; they don't re- 
spond properly to conditioning. poor devils! bernard's one of them. 
luckily for him, he's pretty good at his job. otherwise the director 
would never have kept him. however," he added consolingly, "i think 
he's pretty harmless." 

pretty harmless, perhaps; but also pretty disquieting. that mania, to 
start with, for doing things in private. which meant, in practice, not 
doing anything at all. for what was there that one could do in private. 
(apart, of course, from going to bed: but one couldn't do that all the 
time.) yes, what was there? precious little. the first afternoon they 
went out together was particularly fine. leni

 profoundly miserable, that lenina felt all her triumph 
suddenly evaporate. perhaps he had found her too plump, after all. 

"i told you so," was all that fanny said, when lenina came and made 
her confidences. "it's the alcohol they put in his surrogate." 

"all the same," lenina insisted. "i do like him. he has such awfully nice 
hands. and the way he moves his shoulders-that's very attractive." 
she sighed. "but i wish he weren't so odd."

halting for a moment outside the door of the director's room, ber- 
nard drew a deep breath and squared his shoulders, bracing himself to 



meet the dislike and disapproval which he was certain of finding 
within. he knocked and entered. 

"a permit for you to initial, director," he said as airily as possible, and 
laid the paper on the writing-table. 

the director glanced at him sourly. but the stamp of the world con- 
troller's office was at the head of the paper and the signature of mus- 
tapha mond, bold and black, across the bottom. everyt

small pale letters abject at the feet of mustapha mond-and was about 
to return the paper without a word of comment or genial ford-speed, 
when his eye was caught by something written in the body of the per- 
mit. 

"for the new mexican reservation?" he said, and his tone, the face he 
lifted to bernard, expressed a kind of agitated astonishment. 

surprised by his surprise, bernard nodded. there was a silence.

he said, speaking more to himself than to bernard. "twenty years, i

and shook his head. 

bernard felt extremely uncomfortable. a man so conventional, so scru- 
pulously correct as the director-and to commit so gross a solecism! it 
made him want to hide his face, to run out of the room. not that he 
himself saw anything intrinsically objectionable in people talking about 
the remote past; that was one of those hypnopaedic prejudices he had 
(so he imagined) completely got rid of. what made him feel shy was 
the knowledge that the director disapproved-disapproved and yet had 
been betrayed into doing the forbidden thing. under what inward com- 
pulsion? through his discomfort bernard

leep-taught consolation did not 
seem to be very effective. shaking his head, "i actually dream about it 
sometimes," the director went on in a low voice. "dream of being 
woken up by that peal of thunder and finding her gone; dream of 
searching and searching for her under the trees." he lapsed into the 
silence of reminiscence. 

"you must have had a terrible shock," said bernard, almost enviously. 

at the sound of his voice the director started into a guilty realization of 
where he was; shot a glance at bernard, and averting his eyes, 
blushed darkly; looked at him again with sudden suspicion and, angrily 
on his dignity, "don't imagine," he said, "that i'd had any indecorous 
relation with the girl. nothing emotional, nothing long-drawn. it was all 
perfectly healthy and normal." he handed bernard the permit. "i really 
don't know why i bored you with this trivial anecdote." furious with

outside working hours. you may say that this is not my business. but it 
is. i have the good name of the centre to think of. my workers must 
be above suspicion, particularly those of the highest castes. alphas are 
so conditioned that they do not have to be infantile in their emotional 
behaviour. but that is all the more reason for their making a special ef- 
fort to conform. it is their duty to be infantile, even against their incli- 
nation. and so, mr. marx, i give you fair warning." the director's voice 
vibrated with an indignation that had now become wholly righteous 
and impersonal-was the expression of the disapproval of society itself. 
"if ever i hear again of any lapse from a proper standard of infantile 
decorum, i shall ask for your transference to a sub-centre-preferably 
to iceland. good morning." and swivelling round in his chair, he picked 
up his pen and began to write.

back to lenina. his face was pale, his expression utterly dejected. 

"what's the matter?" she asked. 

"the matter?" he dropped heavily into a chair. "i'm going to be sent to 
iceland." 

often in the past he had wondered what it would be like to be sub- 
jected (soma-less and with nothing but his own inward resources to 
rely on) to some great trial, some pain, some persecution; he had 
even longed for affliction. as recently as a week ago, in the director's 
office, he had imagined himself courageously resisting, stoically ac- 
cepting suffering without a word. the director's threats had actually 
elated him, made him feel larger than life. but that, as he now real- 
ized, was because he had not taken the threats quite seriously, he had 
not believed that, when it came to the point, the d.h.c. would ever do 
anything. now that it looked as though the threats were really to be 
fulfilled, bernard was appalled. of that imagined stoicism, that theo

he raged against himself-what a fooll-against the director-how unfair 
not to give him that other chance, that other chance which, he now 
had no doubt at all, he had always intended to take. and iceland, ice-

lenina shook her head. "was and will make me ill," she quoted, "i take

bent and emaciated to the bone, almost fleshless. very slowly he came 
down, pausing at each rung before he ventured another step. 

"what's the matter with him?" whispered lenina. her eyes were wide 
with horror and amazement. 



"he's old, that's all," bernard answered as carelessly as he could. he 
too was startled; but he made an effort to seem unmoved. 

"old?" she repeated. "but the director's old; lots of people are old; 
they're not like that." 

"that's because we don't allow them to be like that. we preserve them 
from diseases. we keep their internal secretions artificially balanced at 
a youthful equilibrium. we don't permit their magnesium-calcium ratio 
to fall below what it was at thirty. we give them transfusion of young 
blood. we keep their metabolism permanently stimulated. so, of 
course, they don't look like that. partly," he added, "because most of

the hands of all the four thousand electric clocks in all the blooms- 
bury centre's four thousand rooms marked twenty-seven minutes past 
two. "this hive of industry," as the director was fond of calling it, was 
in the full buzz of work. every one was busy, everything in ordered 
motion. under the microscopes, their long tails furiously lashing, 
spermatozoa were burrowing head first into eggs; and, fertilized, the 
eggs were expanding, dividing, or if bokanovskified, budding and 
breaking up into whole populations of separate embryos. from the so- 
cial predestination room the escalators went rumbling down into the 
basement, and there, in the crimson darkness, stewingly w

playrooms where, the weather having turned to rain, nine hundred 
older children were amusing themselves with bricks and clay model- 
ling, hunt-the-zipper, and erotic play. 

buzz, buzz! the hive was humming, busily, joyfully. blithe was the 
singing of the young girls over their test-tubes, the predestinators 
whistled as they worked, and in the decanting room what glorious 
jokes were cracked above the empty bottles! but the director's face, 
as he entered the fertilizing room with henry foster, was grave, 
wooden with severity. 

"a public example," he was saying. "in this room, because it contains 
more high-caste workers than any other in the centre. i have told him 
to meet me here at half-past two." 

"he does his work very well," put in henry, with hypocritical generos- 
ity. 

"i know. but that's all the more reason for severity. his intellectual 
eminence carries with it corresponding moral responsibilities. the

bators. "we can make a new one with the greatest ease-as many as 
we like. unorthodoxy threatens more than the life of a mere individual; 
it strikes at society itself. yes, at society itself," he repeated. "ah, but 
here he comes." 

bernard had entered the room and was advancing between the rows of 
fertilizers towards them. a veneer of jaunty self-confidence thinly con- 
cealed his nervousness. the voice in which he said, "good-morning, 
director," was absurdly too loud; that in which, correcting his mistake, 



he said, "you asked me to come and speak to you here," ridiculously 
soft, a squeak. 

"yes, mr. marx," said the director portentously. "i did ask you to come 
to me here. you returned from your holiday last night, i understand." 

"yes," bernard answered. 

"yes-s," repeated the director, lingering, a serpent, on the "s." then, 
suddenly raising his voice, "ladies and gentlemen," he trumpeted, "la- 
dies and gentlemen."

singing of the girls over their test-tubes, the preoccupied whistling 
of the microscopists, suddenly ceased. there was a profound silence; 
every one looked round. 

"ladies and gentlemen," the director repeated once more, "excuse me 
for thus interrupting your labours. a painful duty constrains me. the 
security and stability of society are in danger. yes, in danger, ladies 
and gentlemen. this man," he pointed accusingly at bernard, "this 
man who stands before you here, this alpha-plus to whom so much

others astray by his unfordly example." the director paused; then, 
folding his arms, he turned impressively to bernard. "marx," he said,

passed upon you?" 

"yes, i can," bernard answered in a very loud voice.

director. 

"certainly. but it's in the passage. one moment." bernard hurried to 
the door and threw it open. "come in," he commanded, and the reason 
came in and showed itself. 

there was a gasp, a murmur of astonishment and horror; a young girl 
screamed; standing on a chair to get a better view some one upset 
two test-tubes full of spermatozoa. bloated, sagging, and among those 
firm youthful bodies, those undistorted faces, a strange and terrifying 
monster of middle-agedness, linda advanced into

walked, with what was meant to be a voluptuous undulation, her 
enormous haunches. bernard walked beside her. 

"there he is," he said, pointing at the director. 

"did you think i didn't recognize him?" linda asked indignantly; then, 
turning to the director, "of course i knew you; tomakin, i should have

"tomakin!" she ran forward, her blanket trailing behind her, threw her 
arms round his neck, hid her face on his chest. 

a howl of laughter went up irrepressibly.

stopped struggling and stood, his hands on her wrists, staring down at 
her, horrified. "yes, a baby-and i was its mother." she flung the ob

how awful, tomakin ... but he was a comfort to me, all the same." 
turning towards the door, "john!" she called. "john!" 

he came in at once, paused for a moment just inside the door, looked 
round, then soft on his moccasined feet strode quickly across the 
room, fell on his knees in front of the director, and said in a clear 
voice: "my father!" 

the word (for "father" was not so much obscene as-with its connota- 
tion of something at one remove from the loathsomeness and moral 
obliquity of child-bearing-merely gross, a scatological rather than a 
pornographic impropriety); the comically smutty word relieved what 
had become a quite intolerable tension. laughter broke out, enor- 
mous, almost hysterical, peal after peal, as though it would never

that was really too good. the whooping and the roaring renewed 
themselves, faces seemed on the point of disintegration, tears were 
streaming. six more test-tubes of spermatozoa were upset. my father! 

pale, wild-eyed, the director glared about him in an agony of bewil- 
dered humiliation. 

my father! the laughter, which had shown signs of dying away, broke 
out again more loudly than ever. he put his hands over his ears and 
rushed out of the room.

have whichever of them he liked. 

"bernard's asked me to meet the savage next wednesday," fanny an- 
nounced triumphantly. 

"i'm so glad," said lenina. "and now you must admit that you were 
wrong about bernard. don't you think he's really rather sweet?" 

fanny nodded. "and i must say," she said, "i was quite agreeably sur-

tant fertilizer-generals, the professor of feelies in the college of emo- 
tional engineering, the dean of the westminster community singery,

was interminable. 

"and i had six girls last week," he confided to helmholtz watson. "one

emptiness, a breathless apprehension, a nausea. her heart seemed to 
stop beating. 

"perhaps it's because he doesn't like me," she said to herself. and at 
once this possibility became an established certainty: john had refused 
to come because he didn't like her. he didn't like her. ... 

"it really is a bit too thick," the head mistress of eton was saying to 
the director of crematoria and phosphorus reclamation. "when i think 
that i actually ..." 

"yes," came the voice of fanny crowne, "it's absolutely true about the 
alcohol. some one i know knew some one who was working in the 
embryo store at the time. she said to my friend, and my friend said to 
me ..." 

"too bad, too bad," said henry foster, sympathizing with the arch-

and by opposing end them ... but you don't do either. neither suffer

he was suddenly silent, thinking of his mother. in her room on the 
thirty-seventh floor, linda had floated in a sea of singing lights and 
perfumed caresses-floated away, out of space, out of time, out of the 
prison of her memories, her habits, her aged and bloated body. and 
tomakin, ex-director of hatcheries and conditioning, tomakin was still 
on holiday-on holiday from humiliation and pain, in a world where he 
could not hear those words, that derisive laughter, could not see that 
hideous face, feel those moist and flabby arms round his neck, in a 
beautiful world ... 

"what you need," the savage went on, "is something with tears for a 
change. nothing costs enough here."

the savage told him that. "twelve and
