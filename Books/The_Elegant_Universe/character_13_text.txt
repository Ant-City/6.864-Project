thousands of years,
but the notion of an always existing, never changing universe was too ingrained for even this radical
thinker to abandon. for this reason, einstein revisited his equations and modified them by introducing
something  known  as  a cosmological  constant,  an  additional  term  that  allowed  him  to  avoid  this
prediction and once again bask in the comfort of a static universe. however, 12 years later, through
detailed measurements of distant galaxies, the american astronomer edwin hubble experimentally
established that the universe is expanding. in a now-famous story in the annals of science, einstein
then returned to the original form of his equations, citing his temporary modification of them as the
biggest  blunder  of  his  life.12  his  initial  unwillingness  to  accept  the  conclusion  notwithstanding,
einstein's theory predicted the expansion of the universe. in fact, in the early 1920s—years before
hubble's  measurements—the  russian  meteorologist  alexander  frie
