[CHARACTER] - 
      the narrator of the prologue. [CHARACTER] is based on machiavelli, but he is more of an ironic than a genuine characterization of this author. marlowe uses [CHARACTER] to set the scene for a drama filled with irreligion, intrigue, and duplicity--traits that elizabethans mistakenly identified as quintessentially machiavellian. thus, marlowe shows his gift at dramatizing contemporary beliefs in a way that may be read as serious or satirical.
