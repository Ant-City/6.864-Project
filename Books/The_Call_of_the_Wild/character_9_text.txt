s fast as he could snap, and eyes diabolically
gleaming--the incarnation of belligerent fear. so terrible was his
appearance that spitz was forced to forego disciplining him; but to
cover his own discomfiture he turned upon the inoffensive and wailing
billee and drove him to the confines of the camp.

by evening perrault secured another dog, an old husky, long and lean
and gaunt, with a battle-scarred face and a single eye which flashed a
warning of prowess that commanded respect. he was called sol-leks, which
means the angry one. like dave, he asked nothing, gave nothing, expected
nothing; and when he marched slowly and deliberately into their midst,
even spitz left him alone. he had one peculiarity which buck was unlucky
enough to discover. he did not like to be approached on his blind side.
of this offence buck was unwittingly guilty, and the first knowledge he
had of his indiscretion was when sol-leks whirled upon him and slashed
his shoulder to the bone for three inches up and down. forev

 gladdened by the possession of buck.

three more huskies were added to the team inside an hour, making a total
of nine, and before another quarter of an hour had passed they were in
harness and swinging up the trail toward the dyea canon. buck was
glad to be gone, and though the work was hard he found he did not
particularly despise it. he was surprised at the eagerness which
animated the whole team and which was communicated to him; but still
more surprising was the change wrought in dave and sol-leks. they
were new dogs, utterly transformed by the harness. all passiveness and
unconcern had dropped from them. they were alert and active, anxious
that the work should go well, and fiercely irritable with whatever, by
delay or confusion, retarded that work. the toil of the traces seemed
the supreme expression of their being, and all that they lived for and
the only thing in which they took delight.

he team was strung out ahead, single file,
to the leader, which position was filled by spitz.

buck had been purposely placed between dave and sol-leks so that he
might receive instruction. apt scholar that he was, they were equally
apt teachers, never allowing him to linger long in error, and enforcing
their teaching with their sharp teeth. dave was fair and very wise. he
never nipped buck without cause, and he never failed to nip him when he
stood in need of it. as francois’s whip backed him up, buck found it
to be cheaper to mend his ways than to retaliate. once, during a brief
halt, when he got tangled in the traces and delayed the start

 had buck seen such
dogs. it seemed as though their bones would burst through their skins.
they were mere skeletons, draped loosely in draggled hides, with blazing
eyes and slavered fangs. but the hunger-madness made them terrifying,
irresistible. there was no opposing them. the team-dogs were swept back
against the cliff at the first onset. buck was beset by three huskies,
and in a trice his head and shoulders were ripped and slashed. the din
was frightful. billee was crying as usual. dave and sol-leks, dripping
blood from a score of wounds, were fighting bravely side by side. joe
was snapping like a demon. once, his teeth closed on the fore leg of
a husky, and he crunched down through the bone. pike, the malingerer,
leaped upon the crippled animal, breaking its neck with a quick flash of
teeth and a jerk, buck got a frothing adversary by the throat, and was
sprayed with blood when his teeth sank through the jugular. the warm
taste of it in his mouth goaded him to greater fierceness. he flung

his time with a patience that was nothing less than primitive.

it was inevitable that the clash for leadership should come. buck wanted
it. he wanted it because it was his nature, because he had been
gripped tight by that nameless, incomprehensible pride of the trail and
trace--that pride which holds dogs in the toil to the last gasp, which
lures them to die joyfully in the harness, and breaks their hearts
if they are cut out of the harness. this was the pride of dave as
wheel-dog, of sol-leks as he pulled with all his strength; the pride
that laid hold of them at break of camp, transforming them from sour and
sullen brutes into straining, eager, ambitious creatures; the pride
that spurred them on all day and dropped them at pitch of camp at night,
letting them fall back into gloomy unrest and uncontent. this was the
pride that bore up spitz and made him thrash the sled-dogs who blundered
and shirked in the traces or hid away at harness-up time in the morning.
likewise it was this pr

 his prostrate rival, and the butt of the whip was brought into
play. half-stunned by the blow, buck was knocked backward and the lash
laid upon him again and again, while spitz soundly punished the many
times offending pike.

in the days that followed, as dawson grew closer and closer, buck still
continued to interfere between spitz and the culprits; but he did it
craftily, when francois was not around, with the covert mutiny of buck,
a general insubordination sprang up and increased. dave and sol-leks
were unaffected, but the rest of the team went from bad to worse.
things no longer went right. there was continual bickering and jangling.
trouble was always afoot, and at the bottom of it was buck. he kept
francois busy, for the dog-driver was in constant apprehension of the
life-and-death struggle between the two which he knew must take place
sooner or later; and on more than one night the sounds of quarrelling
and strife among the other dogs turned him out of his sleeping robe,
fearful that

, the good-natured, was less good-natured, and whined not half
so placatingly as in former days. buck never came near spitz without
snarling and bristling menacingly. in fact, his conduct approached that
of a bully, and he was given to swaggering up and down before spitz’s
very nose.

the breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs in their
relations with one another. they quarrelled and bickered more than ever
among themselves, till at times the camp was a howling bedlam. dave and
sol-leks alone were unaltered, though they were made irritable by the
unending squabbling. francois swore strange barbarous oaths, and stamped
the snow in futile rage, and tore his hair. his lash was always singing
among the dogs, but it was of small avail. directly his back was turned
they were at it again. he backed up spitz with his whip, while buck
backed up the remainder of the team. francois knew he was behind all the
trouble, and buck knew he knew; but buck was too clever ever again to be

e drew him to the fire and by its light pointed
them out.

“dat spitz fight lak hell,” said perrault, as he surveyed the gaping
rips and cuts.

“an’ dat buck fight lak two hells,” was francois’s answer. “an’ now we
make good time. no more spitz, no more trouble, sure.”

while perrault packed the camp outfit and loaded the sled, the
dog-driver proceeded to harness the dogs. buck trotted up to the place
spitz would have occupied as leader; but francois, not noticing him,
brought sol-leks to the coveted position. in his judgment, sol-leks was
the best lead-dog left. buck sprang upon sol-leks in a fury, driving him
back and standing in his place.

“eh? eh?” francois cried, slapping his thighs gleefully. “look at dat
buck. heem keel dat spitz, heem t’ink to take de job.”

“go ‘way, chook!” he cried, but buck refused to budge.

he took buck by the scruff of the neck, and though the dog growled
threateningly, dragged him to one side and replaced sol-leks. the old

 did not like it, and showed plainly that he was afraid of buck.
francois was obdurate, but when he turned his back buck again displaced
sol-leks, who was not at all unwilling to go.

francois was angry. “now, by gar, i feex you!” he cried, coming back
with a heavy club in his hand.

buck remembered the man in the red sweater, and retreated slowly; nor
did he attempt to charge in when sol-leks was once more brought
forward. but he circled just beyond the range of the club, snarling with
bitterness and rage; and while he circled he watched the club so as to
dodge it if thrown by francois, for he was become wise in the way of
clubs. the driver went about his work, and he called to buck when he was
ready to put him in his old place in front of dave. buck retreated two
or three steps. francois followed him up, whereupon he again retreated.
after some time of this, francois threw down the

their reach. he did not try to run away, but retreated around and around
the camp, advertising plainly that when his desire was met, he would
come in and be good.

francois sat down and scratched his head. perrault looked at his watch
and swore. time was flying, and they should have been on the trail an
hour gone. francois scratched his head again. he shook it and grinned
sheepishly at the courier, who shrugged his shoulders in sign that they
were beaten. then francois went up to where sol-leks stood and called
to buck. buck laughed, as dogs laugh, yet kept his distance. francois
unfastened sol-leks’s traces and put him back in his old place. the team
stood harnessed to the sled in an unbroken line, ready for the trail.
there was no place for buck save at the front. once more francois
called, and once more buck laughed and kept away.

“t’row down de club,” perrault commanded.

francois complied, whereupon buck trotted in, laughing triumphantly,
and swung around into position a

and with both men running they dashed out

highly as the dog-driver had forevalued buck, with his two devils, he
found, while the day was yet young, that he had undervalued. at a bound
buck took up the duties of leadership; and where judgment was required,
and quick thinking and quick acting, he showed himself the superior even
of spitz, of whom francois had never seen an equal.

but it was in giving the law and making his mates live up to it, that
buck excelled. dave and sol-leks did not mind the change in leadership.
it was none of their business. their business was to toil, and toil
mightily, in the traces. so long as that were not interfered with, they
did not care what happened. billee, the good-natured, could lead for all
they cared, so long as he kept order. the rest of the team, however, had
grown unruly during the last days of spitz, and their surprise was great
now that buck proceeded to lick them into shape.

of buck’s life for good.

a scotch half-breed took charge of him and his mates, and in company
with a dozen other dog-teams he started back over the weary trail to
dawson. it was no light running now, nor record time, but heavy toil
each day, with a heavy load behind; for this was the mail train,
carrying word from the world to the men who sought gold under the shadow
of the pole.

buck did not like it, but he bore up well to the work, taking pride in
it after the manner of dave and sol-leks, and seeing that his mates,
whether they prided in it or not, did their fair share. it was a
monotonous life, operating with machine-like regularity. one day was
very like another. at a certain time each morning the cooks turned out,
fires were built, and breakfast was eaten. then, while some broke camp,
others harnessed the dogs, and they were under way an hour or so before
the darkness fell which gave warning of dawn. at night, camp was made.
some pitched the flies, others cut firewood and pi

no man sought his sleeping-robe till he had seen to the feet of
the dogs he drove. still, their strength went down. since the beginning
of the winter they had travelled eighteen hundred miles, dragging sleds
the whole weary distance; and eighteen hundred miles will tell upon life
of the toughest. buck stood it, keeping his mates up to their work and
maintaining discipline, though he, too, was very tired. billee cried and
whimpered regularly in his sleep each night. joe was sourer than ever,
and sol-leks was unapproachable, blind side or other side.

but it was dave who suffered most of all. something had gone wrong with
him. he became more morose and irritable, and when camp was pitched at
once made his nest, where his driver fed him. once out of the harness
and down, he did not get on his feet again till harness-up time in the
morning. sometimes, in the traces, when jerked by a sudden stoppage of
the sled, or by straining to start it, he would cry out with pain. the
driver examined him, but c

last pipes before going to bed, and one night they held a consultation.
he was brought from his nest to the fire and was pressed and prodded
till he cried out many times. something was wrong inside, but they could
locate no broken bones, could not make it out.

by the time cassiar bar was reached, he was so weak that he was falling
repeatedly in the traces. the scotch half-breed called a halt and took
him out of the team, making the next dog, sol-leks, fast to the sled.
his intention was to rest dave, letting him run free behind the sled.
sick as he was, dave resented being taken out, grunting and growling
while the traces were unfastened, and whimpering broken-heartedly when
he saw sol-leks in the position he had held and served so long. for the
pride of trace and trail was his, and, sick unto death, he could not
bear that another dog should do his work.

when the sled started, he floundered in the soft snow alongside the
beaten trail, atta

cking sol-leks with his teeth, rushing against him and
trying to thrust him off into the soft snow on the other side, striving
to leap inside his traces and get between him and the sled, and all the
while whining and yelping and crying with grief and pain. the half-breed
tried to drive him away with the whip; but he paid no heed to the
stinging lash, and the man had not the heart to strike harder. dave
refused to run quietly on the trail behind the sled, where the going was
easy, but continued to flounder alo

ngside in the soft snow, where the
going was most difficult, till exhausted. then he fell, and lay where he
fell, howling lugubriously as the long train of sleds churned by.

with the last remnant of his strength he managed to stagger along behind
till the train made another stop, when he floundered past the sleds to
his own, where he stood alongside sol-leks. his driver lingered a moment
to get a light for his pipe from the man behind. then he returned and
started his dogs. they swung out on the trail with remarkable lack of
exertion, turned their heads uneasily, and stopped in surprise. the
driver was surprised, too; the sled had not moved. he called his
comrades to witness the sight. dave had bitten through both of
sol-leks’s traces, and was standing directly in front of the sled in his
proper place.

he pleaded with his eyes to remain there. t

er v. the toil of trace and trail


thirty days from the time it left dawson, the salt water mail, with buck
and his mates at the fore, arrived at skaguay. they were in a wretched
state, worn out and worn down. buck’s one hundred and forty pounds
had dwindled to one hundred and fifteen. the rest of his mates, though
lighter dogs, had relatively lost more weight than he. pike, the
malingerer, who, in his lifetime of deceit, had often successfully
feigned a hurt leg, was now limping in earnest. sol-leks was limping,
and dub was suffering from a wrenched shoulder-blade.

they were all terribly footsore. no spring or rebound was left in them.
their feet fell heavily on the trail, jarring their bodies and doubling
the fatigue of a day’s travel. there was nothing the matter with them
except that they were dead tired. it was not the dead-tiredness that
comes through brief and excessive effort, from which recovery is a
matter of hours; but it was the dead-tiredness that comes through the
slow and

en billee, the good-natured, fell and could not rise.
hal had traded off his revolver, so he took the axe and knocked billee
on the head as he lay in the traces, then cut the carcass out of the
harness and dragged it to one side. buck saw, and his mates saw, and
they knew that this thing was very close to them. on the next day koona
went, and but five of them remained: joe, too far gone to be malignant;
pike, crippled and limping, only half conscious and not conscious enough
longer to malinger; sol-leks, the one-eyed, still faithful to the toil
of trace and trail, and mournful in that he had so little strength with
which to pull; teek, who had not travelled so far that winter and who
was now beaten more than the others because he was fresher; and buck,
still at the head of the team, but no longer enforcing discipline or
striving to enforce it, blind with weakness half the time and keeping
the trail by the loom of it and by the dim feel of his feet.

get up there! mush on!”

thornton went on whittling. it was idle, he knew, to get between a fool
and his folly; while two or three fools more or less would not alter the
scheme of things.

but the team did not get up at the command. it had long since passed
into the stage where blows were required to rouse it. the whip flashed
out, here and there, on its merciless errands. john thornton compressed
his lips. sol-leks was the first to crawl to his feet. teek followed.
joe came next, yelping with pain. pike made painful efforts. twice he
fell over, when half up, and on the third attempt managed to rise. buck
made no effort. he lay quietly where he had fallen. the lash bit into
him again and again, but he neither whined nor struggled. several times
thornton started, as though to speak, but changed his mind. a moisture
came into his eyes, and, as the whipping continued, he arose and walked
irresolutely up and d

les with the axe-handle, knocking the knife
to the ground. he rapped his knuckles again as he tried to pick it up.
then he stooped, picked it up himself, and with two strokes cut buck’s
traces.

hal had no fight left in him. besides, his hands were full with his
sister, or his arms, rather; while buck was too near dead to be of
further use in hauling the sled. a few minutes later they pulled out
from the bank and down the river. buck heard them go and raised his head
to see, pike was leading, sol-leks was at the wheel, and between were
joe and teek. they were limping and staggering. mercedes was riding the
loaded sled. hal guided at the gee-pole, and charles stumbled along in
the rear.

as buck watched them, thornton knelt beside him and with rough, kindly
hands searched for broken bones. by the time his search had disclosed
nothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation, the
sled was a quarter of a mile away. dog and man watched it crawling along
over the ice. suddenly, t
