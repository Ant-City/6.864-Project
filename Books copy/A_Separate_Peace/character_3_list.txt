Brinker Hadley - 
                 A
charismatic class politician with an inclination for orderliness
and organization. Brinker is very straight-laced and conservative.
He has complete confidence in his own abilities and has a tendency
to carry his ideas through with startling efficiency--at times even
ruthlessness. Manifesting a mindset opposite to that of Finny, who
delights in innocent anarchy, Brinker believes in justice and order
and goes to great lengths to discover the truth when he feels that it
is being hidden from him.
