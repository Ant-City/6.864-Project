e and sweaters go to his laundry just as they had insisted on a caddy who could find golf-balls. a little later he was doing their wives' lingerie as well--and running five branches in different parts of the city. before he was twenty-seven he owned the largest string of laundries in his section of the country. it was then that he sold out and went to new york. but the part of his story that concerns us goes back to the days when he was making his first big success.

when he was twenty-three mr. hart--one of the gray-haired men who like to say "now there's a boy"--gave him a guest card to the sherry island golf club for a week-end. so he signed his name one day on the register, and that afternoon played golf in a foursome with mr. hart and mr. sandwood and mr. t. a. hedrick. he did not consider it necessary to remark that he had once carried mr. hart's bag over this same links, and that he knew every trap and gully with his eyes shut--but he found himself glancing at the four caddies who tr

"she'd play pretty good golf if she'd try," said mr. sandwood.

"she has no form," said mr. hedrick solemnly.

"she has a nice figure," said mr. sandwood.

"better thank the lord she doesn't drive a swifter ball," said mr. hart, winking at dexter.
