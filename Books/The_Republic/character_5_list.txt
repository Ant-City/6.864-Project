Empirical - 
                When
something is an empirical question, that means that the question
can only be settled by going out into the world and investigating.
The question, "What percentage of the population of the United States
likes ice cream" is an example of an empirical question, which can
only be answered through empirical investigation. The question "What
is the square root of two," on the other hand, is not an empirical
question. In order to answer this question all you have to do is think
about the mathematics involved; you do not have investigate evidence
in the world.
