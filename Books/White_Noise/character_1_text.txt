i left my office and walked down the hill and into town. there are houses in town with turrets and
two-story porches where people sit in the shade of ancient maples. there are greek revival and gothic
churches.  there  is  an  insane  asylum  with  an  elongated  portico,  ornamented  dormers  and  a  steeply
pitched roof topped by a pineapple finial. babette and i and our children by previous marriages live at the
end of a quiet street in what was once a wooded area with deep ravines. there is an expressway beyond
the backyard now, well below us, and at night as we settle into our brass bed the sparse traffic washes
past, a remote and steady murmur around our sleep, as of dead souls babbling at the edge of a dream.

know  or  care  what  she  looks  like.  not  that  she  is  a  gift-bearer  of  great  things  as  the  world  generally
reckons  them.  she  gathers  and  tends  the  children,  teaches  a  course  in  an  adult  education  program,

rewarded,  bound  up  with  a  full-souled  woman,  a  lover  of  daylight  and  dense  life,  the  miscellaneous
swarming  air  of  families.  i  watch  her  all  the  time  doing  things  in  measured  sequence,  skillfully,  with
seeming ease, unlike my former wives, who had a tendency to feel estranged from the objective world-- a
self-absorbed and high-strung bunch, with ties to the intelligence community.

all satisfied with what we'd been able to snatch from the cupboards and refrigerator or swipe from each
other and we began quietly plastering mustard or mayonnaise on our brightly colored food. the mood was
one of deadly serious anticipation, a reward hard-won. the table was crowded and babette and denise
elbowed each other twice, although neither spoke. wilder was still seated on the counter surrounded by
open cartons, crumpled tinfoil, shiny bags of potato chips, bowls of pasty substances covered with plastic
wrap, flip-top rings and twist ties, individually wrapped slices of orange cheese. heinrich came in, studied

denise was eleven, a hard-nosed kid.  she led a  more or less daily protest against those of her
mother's habits that struck her as wasteful or dangerous. i defended babette. i told her i was the one who
needed  to  show  discipline  in  matters  of  diet.  i  reminded  her  how  much  i  liked  the  way  she  looked.  i
suggested there was an honesty inherent in bulkiness if it is just the right amount. people trust a certain

she  took  taxis  to  school,  made  phone  calls  to  friends  in  seoul  and  tokyo.  abroad  she'd  wanted  to  eat
ketchup sandwiches with trix sticks. now she cooked fierce sizzling meals of scallion bushes and baby
shrimp, monopolizing tweedy's restaurant-quality range.

that  night,  a  friday,  we  ordered  chinese  food  and  watched  television  together,  the  six  of  us.
babette  had  made  it  a  rule.  she  seemed  to  think  that  if  kids  watched  television  one  night  a  week  with
parents or stepparents, the effect would be to de-glamorize the medium in their eyes, make it wholesome
domestic  sport.  its  narcotic  undertow  and  eerie  diseased  brain-sucking  power  would  be  gradually

on one such night i got into bed next to babette and told her how the chancellor had advised me,
back  in  1968,  to  do  something  about  my  name  and  appearance  if  i  wanted  to  be  taken  seriously  as  a
hitler innovator. jack gladney would not do, he said, and asked me what other names i might have at my
disposal. we  finally agreed  that i should  invent an extra initial and call  myself j. a.  k. gladney, a tag  i
wore like a borrowed suit.

the chancellor warned against what he called my tendency to make a feeble presentation of

been  in  the  effort.  the  glasses  with  thick  black  heavy  frames  and  dark  lenses  were  my  own  idea,  an
alternative to the bushy beard that my wife of the period didn't want me to grow. babette said she liked the
series  j.  a.  k.  and  didn't  think  it  was  attention-getting  in  a  cheap  sense.  to  her  it  intimated  dignity,

peaches.  there  was  a  white  package  of  bacon  without  a  plastic  window  for  viewing  a  representative
slice. a jar of roasted nuts had a white wrapper bearing the words irregular peanuts. murray kept
nodding to babette as i introduced them.

'this  is  the  new  austerity,"  he  said.  "flavorless  packaging.  it  appeals  to  me.  i  feel  i'm  not  only
saving money but contributing  to some kind of spiritual consensus.  it's like world war hi.  everything is

contributed to the history of erotic practices. there is a double fantasy at work in such letters. people write
down  imagined  episodes  and  then  see  them  published  in  a  national  magazine.  which  is  the  greater

"what does baba use?"

"don't ask me. ask denise."

"how do you know she uses anything?"

"ask denise."

"why don't i ask baba?"

"ask baba," she said.


murray came out of an aisle and walked alongside babette, just ahead of us. he took a twin roll of
paper towels out of her cart and smelled it. denise had found some friends and they went up front to look
at  the  paperback  books  in  spindly  racks,  the  books  with  shiny  metallic  print,  raised  letters,  vivid
illustrations of cult violence and windswept romance. denise was wearing a green visor. i heard babette
tell murray she'd been wearing it fourteen hours a day for three weeks now. she would not go out without

r room. she wore it in school, when there was school, wore it to the toilet, the
dentist's  chair,  the  dinner  table.  something  about  the  visor  seemed  to  speak  to  her,  to  offer  wholeness
and identity.
"it's her interface with the world," murray said.


he  helped  babette  push  her  loaded  cart.  i  heard  him  say  to  her,  "tibetans  believe  there  is  a
transitional state between death and rebirth. death is a waiting period, basically. soon a fresh womb will
receive the soul. in the meantime the soul restores to itself some of the divinity lost at birth." he studied
her profile as if to detect a reaction. "that's what i think of whenever i come in here. this place recharges
us spiritually, it prepares us, it's a gateway or pathway. look how bright. it's f

he studied her profile. she put some yogurt in her cart.


"tibetans try to see death for what it is. it is the end of attachment to things. this simple truth is
hard  to  fathom.  but  once  we  stop  denying  death,  we  can  proceed  calmly  to  die  and  then  go  on  to
experience  uterine  rebirth  or  judeo-  christian  afterlife  or  out-of-body  experience  or  a  trip  on  a  ufo  or

babette said, "where is wilder?" and turned to stare at me in a way that suggested ten minutes
had  passed  since  she'd  last  seen  him.  other  looks,  less  pensive  and  less  guilty,  indicated  greater  time
spans, deeper seas of inattention. like: "i didn't know whales were mammals." the greater the time span,
the blanker the look, the more dangerous the situation. it was as if guilt were a luxury she allowed herself
only when the danger was minimal.

the three adults each stood at the head of an aisle and peered into the traffic of carts and gliding
bodies. then we did three more aisles, heads set forward, weaving slightly as we changed our sightlines. i
kept  seeing  colored  spots  off  to  the  right  but  when  i  turned  there  was  nothing  there.  i'd  been  seeing
colored spots for years but never so many, so gaily animated. murray saw wilder in another woman's cart.
the woman waved at babette and headed toward us. she lived on our street with a teenage daughter and
an  asian  baby,  chun  duc.  everyone  referred  to  the  baby  by  name,  almost  in  a  tone  of  proud
proprietorship, but no one knew who chun belonged to or where he or she had come from.

before murray went to the express line he invited us to dinner, a week from saturday.

"you don't have to let me know till the last minute."

"we'll be there," babette said.


"i'm not preparing anything major, so just call beforehand and tell me if something else came up.
you don't even have to call. if you don't show up, i'll know that something came up and you couldn't let me

"murray, we'll be there."

"bring the kids."

"no."


"great.  but  if  you  decide  to  bring  them,  no  problem.  i  don't  want  you  to  feel  i'm  holding  you  to

"are you coming back next semester?" i said.

'they want me to teach a course in the cinema of car crashes."

steffie got off the phone. "don't chew at all," she said. "did you ever think of that?"

my  ribs.  the  digital  reading  on  the  clock-radio  was  3:  51.  always  odd  numbers  at  times  like  this.  what

menace? babette murmured in her sleep and i moved close, breathing her heat.

finally  i  slept,  to  be  awakened  by  the  smell  of  burning  toast.  that  would  be  steffie.  she  burns

"we're not supposed to talk about that. she's just a contract agent anyway."

pink  golfer's  face  had  begun  to  droop  from  his  skull.  his  flesh  seemed  generally  to  sag,  giving  him  the
hangdog look of someone under strict orders to lose weight. his hair was expensively cut and layered, a
certain amount of color combed in, a certain amount of technology brought to bear, but it seemed to need
a more dynamic head. i realized babette was looking at him carefully, trying to grasp the meaning of the
four careening years they'd spent as man and wife. the panoramic carnage. he drank, gambled, drove
his  car  down  embankments,  got  fired,  quit,  retired,  traveled  in  disguise  to  coaltown  where  he  paid  a
woman to speak swedish to him as they screwed. it was the swedish that enraged babette, either that or

wearing his camouflage cap and carrying an instamatic, to watch them drag for the bodies, and while he
was there word came that the treadwells had been found alive but shaken in an abandoned cookie shack
at  the  mid-village  mall,  a  vast  shopping  center  out  on  the  interstate.  apparently  they'd  been  wandering
through  the  mall  for  two  days,  lost,  confused  and  frightened,  before  taking

this point why they didn't ask for help. it
was probably just the vastness and strangeness of the place and their own advanced age that made them
feel  helpless  and  adrift  in  a  landscape  of  remote  and  menacing  figures.  the  treadwells  didn't  get  out
much.  in  fact  no  one  yet  knew  how  they'd  managed  to  get  to  the  mall.  possibly  their  grandniece  had
dropped  them  off  in  her  car  and  then  forgotten  to  pick  them  up.  the  grandniece  could  not  be  reached,
babette said, for comment.

the day before the happy discovery, the police had called in a psychic to help them determine the
treadwells' whereabouts and fate. it was all over the local paper. the psychic was a woman who lived in
a mobile home in a wooded area outside town. she wished to be known only as adele t. according to the
paper, she and the police chief, hollis wright, sat in the mobile home while she looked at photos of the

attentive to our duty, our friday assembly. heinrich was not sullen, i was not bored. steffie, brought close
to tears by a sitcom husband arguing with his wife, appeared totally absorbed in these documentary clips
of calamity and death. babette tried to switch to a comedy series about a group of racially mixed kids who
build  their  own  communications  satellite.  she  was  startled  by  the  force  of  our  objection.  we  were
otherwise  silent,  watching  houses  slide  into  the  ocean,  whole  villages  crackle  and  ignite  in  a  mass  of
advancing lava. every disaster made us wish for more, for something bigger, grander, more sweeping.

kitchen  floor  and  looking  through  the  oven  window,  and  we  ate  dinner  quickly,  moving  around  him  or
stepping over him to reach the stove and refrigerator. babette watched him as she ate. she had a class to
teach in sitting, standing and walking. it would start in an hour and a half. she looked at me in a drained
and supplicating way. she'd spoken soothingly to him, hefted and caressed him, checked his teeth, given
him a bath, examined him, tickled him, fed him, tried to get him to crawl into his vinyl play tunnel. her old
people would be waiting in the church basement.

steps to the basement entrance. babette looked at her son--a searching, pleading and desperate look. he
was in the sixth hour of his crying. she ran along the sidewalk and into the building.

i thought of taking him to the hospital. but if a doctor who examined the boy thoroughly in his cozy
office  with  paintings  on  the  wall  in  elaborate  gilded  frames  could  find  nothing  wrong,  then  what  could

now and then a car went by. i leaned against the door, faintly aware of his breath on my thumb. some
time later babette was knocking on the window and wilder was crawling across the seat to lift the latch for
her. she got in, adjusted his hat, picked a crumpled tissue off the floor.

we were halfway home when the crying stopped. it stopped suddenly, without a change in tone
and intensity. babette said nothing, i kept my eyes on the road. he sat between us, looking into the radio.
i waited for  babette  to glance  at me behind  his back, over his head,  to show relief, happiness,  hopeful
suspense. i didn't know

they watched him with something like awe. nearly seven straight hours of serious crying. it was
as though he'd just returned from a period of wandering in some remote and holy place, in sand barrens
or  snowy  ranges--a  place  where  things  are  said,  sights  are  seen,  distances  reached  which  we  in  our
ordinary toil can only regard with the  mingled reverence and wonder we hold in reserve  for feats of the
most sublime and difficult dimensions.

babette said to me in bed one night, "isn't it great having all these kids around?"
"there'll be one more soon."

"who?"

"bee is coming in a couple of days."

"good. who else can we get?"

the next day denise decided to confront her mother directly about the medication she was or was

not  taking,  hoping  to  trick  babette  into  a  confession,  an  admission  or  some  minimal  kind  of  flustered
response. this was not a tactic the girl and i had discussed but i couldn't help admiring the boldness

impressed. they fanned out across the area, each of them suddenly inclined to be private, shadowy, even
secretive. periodically one of them would return to register the name of an item with babette, careful not to
let the others know what it was. i myself was not to be bothered with tedious details. i was the benefactor,

heinrich stood in a corner of the room, taking up his critical-observer position. i gave murray his
coffee and was about to leave when i glanced in passing at the tv screen. i paused at the door, looked
more closely this time. it was true, it was there. i hissed at the others for silence and they swiveled their
heads in my direction, baffled and annoyed. then they followed my gaze to the sturdy tv at the end of the
bed.

the face on the screen was babette's. out of our mouths came a silence as wary and deep as an
animal  growl.  confusion,  fear,  astonishment  spilled  from  our  faces.  what  did  it  mean?  what  was  she
doing  there,  in  black  and  white,  framed  in  formal  borders?  was  she  dead,  missing,  disembodied?  was
this her spirit, her secret self, some two-dimensional facsimile released  by the  power of technology, set
free  to  glide  through  wavebands,  through  energy  levels,  pausing  to  say  good-bye  to  us  from

all  this compressed in seconds. it was only as time drew on, normalized  itself, returned to us a
sense of our surroundings, the room, the house, the reality in which the tv set stood--it was only then that
we understood what was going on.

babette was  teaching her class in  the church basement and it was being  televised by  the local
cable station. either she hadn't known there would be a camera on hand or she preferred not to tell us, out
of embarrassment, love, superstition, whatever causes a person to wish to withhold her image from those
who know her.

with the sound down low we couldn't hear what she was saying. but no one bothered to adjust
the volume. it was the picture that mattered, the face in black and white, animated but al

into  being,  endlessly  being  formed  and  reformed  as  the  muscles  in  her  face  worked  at  smiling  and
speaking, as the electronic dots swarmed.

we were being shot through with babette. her image was projected on our bodies, swam in us
and through us. babette of electrons and photons, of whatever forces produced that gray light we took to
be her face.

the kids were flushed with excitement but i felt a certain disquiet. i tried to tell myself it was only
television--  whatever  that  was,  however  it  worked--and  not  some  journey  out  of  life  or  death,  not  some

the dusty surface of the screen.

then denise crawled up to the set and turned the volume dial. nothing happened. there was no
sound, no voice, nothing. she turned to look at me, a moment of renewed confusion. heinrich advanced,

 different  from  the  ones  we've  learned  to  trust.  when  i  was  halfway  down  the  street  i  saw
heinrich crouched on a small ledge outside our attic window. he wore his camouflage jacket and cap, an
outfit with complex meaning for him, at fourteen, struggling to grow and to escape notice simultaneously,
his secrets known to us all. he looked east through binoculars.

i went around back to the kitchen. in the entranceway the washer and dryer were vibrating nicely.
i  could  tell  from  babette's  voice  that  the  person  she  was  talking  to  on  the  phone  was  her  father.  an
impatience  mixed  with  guilt  and  apprehension.  i  stood  behind  her,  put  my  cold  hands  to  her  cheeks.  a

babette's head appeared at the top of the stairway. she said a neighbor had told her the spill from
the tank car was thirty-five  thousand gallons. people  were being told to stay out of the area.  a feathery
plume hung over the site. she also said the girls were complaining of sweaty palms.

"i don't know but if it gets any bigger it'll get here with or without a wind."

"it won't get here," i said.

"how do you know?"

"because it won't."


she looked at her palms and went upstairs. the phone rang. babette walked into the kitchen and
picked it up. she looked at me as she listened. i wrote two checks, periodically glancing up to see if she
was still looking at  me.  she seemed to study my  face for the  hidden  meaning of the message she was
receiving. i puckered my lips in a way i knew she disliked.

of  the  refrigerator.  i  grabbed  her  by  the  inside  of  the  thigh  as  she  passed  the  table.  she  squirmed

i watched the girls communicate in hooded looks.

denise looked at steffie.

"is it because we want to get it out of the way?" she said.

"why do we want to get it out of the way?"

"in case something happens," steffie said.

"what could happen?" babette said.


the girls looked at each other again, a solemn and lingering exchange that indicated some dark
suspicion  was  being  confirmed.  air-raid  sirens  sounded  again,  this  time  so  close  to  us  that  we  were
negatively affected, shaken to the point of avoiding each other's eyes as a way of denying that something
unusual was going on. the sound came from our own red brick firehouse, sirens that hadn't been tested in
a  decade  or  more.  they  made  a  noise  like  some  territorial

time in minutes we looked at each other, knowing the new sound was an amplified voice but not sure what
it  was  saying.  heinrich  returned,  walking  in  an  over-deliberate  and  stylized  manner,  with  elements  of
stealth. this seemed to mean he was frozen with significance.



"they want us to evacuate," he said, not meeting our eyes.

steffie read a coupon for baby lux, crying softly. this brought denise to life. she went upstairs to
pack some things for all of us. heinrich raced two steps at a time to the attic for his binoculars, highway
map and radio. babette went to the pantry and began gathering tins and jars with familiar life enhancing
labels.
steffie helped me clear the table.


twenty minutes later we were in the car. the voice on the radio said that people in the west end
of town were to head for the abandoned boy scout camp, where red cross volunteers would dispense

i kept punching buttons, hoping to find someone with background information. a woman identified
as a consumer affairs editor began a discussion of the medical problems that could result from personal
contact  with  the  airborne  toxic  event.  babette  and  i  exchanged  a  wary  glance.  she  immediately  began
talking  to  the girls while i  turned the volume down to  keep them  from  learning what they might imagine
was in store for them.

"nothing happens to the dogs," babette said.

"because it only affects humans and rats."

"i don't believe you."

"it could be true," he said, clearly lying. "they use rats to test for things that humans can catch, so
it means we get the same diseases, rats and humans. besides, they wouldn't use dogs if they thought it
could hurt them."

it  was  heinrich  who'd  told  me  that  exposure  to  the  chemical  waste  could  cause  a  person  to
experience a sense of déjà vu.  steffie  wasn't  there when he said  it, but she could  have heard  it on the
kitchen  radio,  where  she  and  denise  had  probably  learned  about  sweaty  palms  and  vomiting  before
developing these symptoms themselves. i didn't think steffie knew what déjà vu meant, but it was possible
babette had told her. déjà vu, however, was no longer a working symptom of nyodene contamination. it
had been preempted by coma, convulsions, and miscarriage. if steffie had learned about déjà vu on the
radio but then missed the subsequent upgrading to more deadly conditions, it could mean she was in a
position  to  be  tricked  by  her  own  apparatus  of  suggestibility.  she  and  denise  had  been  lagging  all

it possible to have a false perception of an illusion? is there a true déjà vu and a false déjà vu? i wondered

she so open to suggestion that she would develop every symptom as it was announced?

i  turned  off  the  radio,  not  to  help  me  think  but  to  keep  me  from  thinking.  vehicles  lurched  and
skidded. someone threw a gum wrapper out a side window and babette made an indignant speech about
inconsiderate people littering the highways and countryside.
"i'll tell you something else that's happened before," heinrich said. "we're running out of gas."

the dial quivered on e.

"that's the way the tank is constructed. so you don't run out."

headed for the far end of the barracks, where we'd, earlier made camp.

we  were  next  to  a  black  family  of  jehovah's  witnesses.  a  man  and  woman  with  a  boy  about
twelve. father and son were handing but tracts to people nearby and seemed to have no trouble finding
willing recipients and listeners.
the woman said to babette, "isn't this something?"

"nothing surprises me anymore," babette said.

"isn't that the truth."

"what would surprise me would be if there were no surprises."

"that sounds about right."

"or if there were little bitty surprises. that would be a surprise. instead of things like this."

"god jehovah's got a bigger surprise in store than this," the woman said.

"god jehovah?"

"that's the one."

i wanted my academic gown and dark glasses.

when  i  got  back  to  the  other  end  of  the  barracks,  the  three  younger  children  were  asleep,
heinrich was making notations on a road map and babette was seated some distance away with old man
treadwell and a number of other blind people. she was reading to them from a small and brightly colored
stack of supermarket tabloids.
i needed a distraction. i found a camp chair and set it near the wall behind babette. there were

four  blind  people,  a  nurse  and  three  sighted  people  arranged  in  a  semicircle  facing  the  reader.  others
occasionally paused to listen to an item or two, then moved on. babette employed her storytelling voice,

"scientists  at  princeton's  famed  institute  for  advanced  studies  have  stunned  the  world  by
presenting absolute and undeniable proof of life after death. a researcher at the world-renowned institute
has  used  hypnosis  to  induce  hundreds  of  people  to  recall  their  previous-life  experiences  as  pyramid-
builders, exchange students and extraterrestrials."
babette changed her voice to do dialogue.


'"in the last year alone,' declares reincarnation hypnotist ling ti wan, 'i have helped hundreds to
regress to previous lives under hypnosis. one of my most amazing subjects was a woman who was able
to recall her life as a hunter-gatherer in the mesolithic era ten thousand years ago. it was remarkable to

of that era which only a trained archaeologist could know about. she even spoke several phrases in the
language of that day, a tongue remarkably similar to modern-day german.'"
babette's voice resumed its tone of straight narration.


"dr. shiv chatterjee, fitness guru and high-energy physicist, recently stunned a live tv audience
by  relating  the  well-documented  case  of  two  women,  unknown  to  each  other,  who  came  to  him  for
regression in the same week, only to discover that they had been twin sisters in the lost city of atlantis fifty
thousand years ago. both women describe the city, before its mysterious and catastrophic plunge into the

"'i  regressed  this  subject  at  least  a  dozen  times,'  says  dr.  chatterjee.  'i  used  the  toughest
professional techniques to get her to contradict herself. but her story is remarkably consistent. it is a tale
of the good that can come from evil.' says little patti, 'at the moment of my death as the viper, i saw a
glowing  circle  of  light.  it  seemed  to  welcome  me,  to  beckon.  it  was  a  warm  spiritual  experience.  i  just
walked right toward it. i was not sad at all.'"

babette did the voices of dr. chatterjee and patti weaver. her chatterjee was a warm and mellow
indian-accented english, with clipped phrasing. she did patti as a child-hero in a contemporary movie, the
only person on screen who is unawed by mysterious throbbing phenomena.

"in  a  further  startling  development  it  was  revealed  by  little  patti  that  the  three  supercelebrities

i studied the faces in the semicircle. no one seemed amazed by this account. old man treadwell

there was no interest shown in discussion.  the story occupied some recess of passive belief. there  it

we kept inventing hope.

in  the  barracks  almost  everyone  was  sleeping.  i  made  my  way  along  a  dim  wall.  the  massed
bodies  lay  in  heavy  rest,  seeming  to  emit  a  single  nasal  sigh.  figures  stirred;  a  wide-eyed  asian  child
watched  me  step  among  a  dozen  clustered  sleeping  bags.  colored  lights  skipped  past  my  right  ear.  i
heard a toilet flush.

i sat a while longer, watching denise, watching wilder, feeling selfless and spiritually large. there
was an empty air mattress on the floor but i wanted to share babette's and eased myself next to her body,
a dreaming mound. her hands, feet and face were drawn under the sheltering coat; only a burst of hair
remained.  i  fell  at  once  into  marine  oblivion,  a  deep-dwelling  crablike  consciousness,  silent  and
dreamless.

night a sense of animal fear and warning.

her who she was, to remove her disguise, grab hold of her maundering life for a time, without warning.
"i could have had things ready. you look awful. where will you sleep?"

"where did i sleep last time?"

they both looked at me, trying to remember.


as we fixed and ate breakfast, as the kids came down and warily approached vernon for kisses
and  hair-mussings,  as  the  hours  passed  and  babette  became  accustomed  to  the  sight  of  the  ambling
figure in patched jeans, i began to notice the pleasure she took in hovering nearby, doing little things for
him, being there to listen. a delight contained in routine gestures and automatic rhythms. at times she had
to remind vernon which foods were his favorites, how he liked them cooked and seasoned, which jokes
he  told  best,  which  figures  from  the  past  were  the  plain  fools,  which  the  comic  heroes.  gleanings  from

and  vernon would say to me, "her mother  made the worst french fries you could ever hope to
eat. like french fries in a state park." and then he'd turn to her and say, "jack knows the problem i have
with state parks. they don't move the heart."

we moved heinrich down to the sofa and gave vernon his room. it was unnerving to find him in
the  kitchen  at  seven  in  the  morning,  at  six,  at  whatever  grayish  hour  babette  or  i  went  down  to  make
coffee. he gave the  impression he was intent on outfoxing us, working on our guilt, showing us that no
matter how little sleep we got, he got less.

babette would watch from a window, managing to express love, worry, exasperation and despair,
hope and gloom, more or less simultaneously. vernon had only to shift his weight to arouse in her a series
of extreme emotions.
he liked to mingle with shopping mall crowds.

"let's be clear about one thing," i said like a high government official.

"your mother is not a drug addict. dylar is not that kind of medication."

"what is it then? just tell me what it is."

something in her voice or in my heart or in the absurdity of the moment allowed me to consider

the possibility of answering her question. a breakthrough. why not simply tell her? she was responsible,
able  to  gauge  the  implications  of  serious  things.  i  realized  babette  and  i  had  been  foolish  all  along,
keeping the truth from her. the girl would embrace the truth, know us better, love us more deeply in our
weakness and fear.

i went and sat at the end of the bed. she watched me carefully. i told her the basic story, leaving
out  the  tears,  the  passions,  the  terror,  the  horror,  my  exposure  to  nyodene  d.,  babette's  sexual
arrangement  with  mr.  gray,  our  argument  over  which  of  us  feared  death  more.  i  concentrated  on  the

the first thing she mentioned was the side effects. every drug has side effects. a drug that could
eliminate fear of death would have awesome side effects, especially if it is still in a trial stage. she was
right, of course. babette had spoken of outright death, brain death, left brain death, partial paralysis, other
cruel and bizarre conditions of the body and mind.
i told denise the power of suggestion could be more important than side effects.

"i'm better off without it."

"it wouldn't have been the first time they tricked me."

"you're still my friend," i said.


i  kissed  her  on  the  head  and  went  to  the  door.  i  realized  i  was  extremely  hungry.  i  went
downstairs  to  find  something  to  eat.  the  kitchen  light  was  on.  vernon  was  sitting  at  the  table,  fully
dressed, smoking and coughing. the ash on his cigarette was an inch long, beginning to lean. it was a
habit of his, letting the ash dangle. babette thought he did it to induce feelings of suspense and anxiety in
others. it was part of the reckless weather in which he moved.

"we're alone here. what is it you want to talk about?"

"they listen in their sleep," he said.


we went out the back door to keep from waking heinrich. i followed him along the pathway at the

jackhammer  and  haul  the  asphalt,  staying  close  to  them  as  they  leveled  the  smoking  pitch.  when  the
workmen left, his visit seemed to end, collapsed into its own lading momentum. we began to see a blank
space where vernon stood. he regarded us from a prudent distance, as if we were strangers with secret
resentments. an indefinable fatigue collected around our efforts to converse.

out on the sidewalk, babette held him and wept. for his departure he'd shaved, washed the car,
put a blue bandanna around his neck. she could not seem to get enough of crying. she looked into his
face and cried. she cried embracing him. she gave him a styrofoam hamper full of sandwiches, chicken
and coffee, and she cried as he set it down amid the gouged-out seat stuffing and slashed upholstery.
"she's a good girl," he told me grimly.

then he coughed a while, giving us one more episode of lashing phlegm. babette wept anew. we leaned
toward the window on the passenger's side, watching him hunch around into his driving posture, setting
himself casually between the door and the seat, his left arm hanging out the window.

"don't worry about me," he said. "the little limp means nothing. people my age limp. a limp is a
natural thing at a certain age. forget the cough. it's healthy to cough. you move the stuff around. the stuff
can't harm you as long as it doesn't settle in one spot and stay there for years.

cooked in it, drove the kids to school, wore it to the hardware store and the stationer's. i thought about it
for  a  while,  decided  there  was  nothing  excessively  odd  in  this,  nothing  to  worry  about,  no  reason  to
