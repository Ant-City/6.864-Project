[CHARACTER] - 
                 macbeth's
wife, a deeply ambitious woman who lusts for power and position.
early in the play she seems to be the stronger and more ruthless
of the two, as she urges her husband to kill duncan and seize the crown.
after the bloodshed begins, however, [CHARACTER] falls victim to
guilt and madness to an even greater degree than her husband. her
conscience affects her to such an extent that she eventually commits
suicide. interestingly, she and macbeth are presented as being deeply
in love, and many of [CHARACTER]'s speeches imply that her influence
over her husband is primarily sexual. their joint alienation from
the world, occasioned by their partnership in crime, seems to strengthen
the attachment that they feel to each another.
