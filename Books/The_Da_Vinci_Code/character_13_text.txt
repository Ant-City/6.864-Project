langdon barely heard him. his eyes were still riveted on the picture. "this symbol here, and the
way his body is so oddly..."

"positioned?" the agent offered.

langdon nodded, feeling a chill as he looked up. "i can't imagine who would do this to someone."

the agent looked grim. "you don't understand, mr. langdon. what you see in this photograph..."
he paused. "monsieur sauniere did that to himself."



chapter 2

one mile away, the hulking albino named silas limped through the front gate of the luxurious
brownstone residence on rue la bruyere. the spiked cilice belt that he wore around his thigh cut
into his flesh, and yet his soul sang with satisfaction of service to the lord.

tonight, at last, silas felt he had begun to repay his debt. hurrying to the dresser, he found the cell
phone hidden in his bottom drawer and placed a call.

"yes?" a male voice answered.

"teacher, i have returned."

"speak," the voice commanded, sounding pleased to hear from him.

"all four are gone. the three senechaux... and the grand master himself."

there was a momentary pause, as if for prayer. "then i assume you have the information?"

an excited breath. "excellent. i had feared the brotherhood's reputation for secrecy might prevail."

"the prospect of death is strong motivation."

"so, my pupil, tell me what i must know."

silas knew the information he had gleaned from his victims would come as a shock. "teacher, all
four confirmed the existence of the clef de voiite... the legendary keystone. "

he heard a quick intake of breath over the phone and could feel the teacher's excitement. "the
keystone. exactly as we suspected."

according to lore, the brotherhood had created a map of stone — a clef de voiite... or keystone — an
engraved tablet that revealed the final resting place of the brotherhood's greatest secret.

information so powerful that its protection was the reason for the brotherhood's very existence.

"when we possess the keystone," the teacher said, "we will be only one step away."

"we are closer than you think. the keystone is here in paris."

"paris? incredible. it is almost too easy."

silas relayed the earlier events of the evening... how all four of his victims, moments before death,
had desperately tried to buy back their godless lives by telling their secret. each had told silas the
exact same thing — that the keystone was ingeniously hidden at a precise location inside one of
paris's ancient churches — the eglise de saint- sulpice.

"inside a house of the lord," the teacher exclaimed. "how they mock us!"

"as they have for centuries."

the teacher fell silent, as if letting the triumph of this moment settle over him. finally, he spoke.
"you have done a great service to god. we have waited centuries for this. you must retrieve the
stone for me. immediately. tonight

. you understand the stakes."

silas knew the stakes were incalculable, and yet what the teacher was now commanding seemed
impossible. "but the church, it is a fortress. especially at night. how will i enter?"

with the confident tone of a man of enormous influence, the teacher explained what was to be
done.



when silas hung up the phone, his skin tingled with anticipation.

one hour, he told himself, grateful that the teacher had given him time to carry out the necessary
penance before entering a house of god. / must purge my soul of today's sins. the sins committed
today had been holy in purpose. acts of war against the enemies of god had been committed for
centuries. forgiveness was assured.

even so, silas knew, absolution required sacrifice.

examined the spiked cilice belt clamped around his thigh. all true followers of the way wore this
device — a leather strap, studded with sharp metal barbs that cut into the flesh as a perpetual
reminder of christ's suffering. the pain caused by the device also helped counteract the desires of
the flesh.



although silas already had worn his cilice today longer than the requisite two hours, he knew
today was no ordinary day. grasping the buckle, he cinched it one notch tighter, wincing as the
barbs dug deeper into his flesh. exhaling slowly, he savored the cleansing ritual of his pain.

teacher of all teachers. although escriva had died in 1975, his wisdom lived on, his words still

agony, silas said a quick prayer. then, gripping one end of the rope, he closed his eyes and swung

as the jet passed over the coast of portugal, the cell phone in aringarosa's cassock began vibrating
in silent ring mode. despite airline regulations prohibiting the use of cell phones during flights,
aringarosa knew this was a call he could not miss. only one man possessed this number, the man
who had mailed aringarosa the phone.

excited, the bishop answered quietly. "yes?"

"silas has located the keystone," the caller said. "it is in paris. within the church of saint-sulpice."

bishop aringarosa smiled. "then we are close."

"we can obtain it immediately. but we need your influence."

"of course. tell me what to do."

when aringarosa switched off the phone, his heart was pounding. he gazed once again into the
void of night, feeling dwarfed by the events he had put into motion.

silas was feeling an aroused anticipation that he had not felt since his previous life. it both
surprised and electrified him. for the last decade, he had been following the way, cleansing
himself of sins... rebuilding his life... erasing the violence in his past. tonight, however, it had all
come rushing back. the hatred he had fought so hard to bury had been summoned. he had been
startled how quickly his past had resurfaced. and with it, of course, had come his skills. rusty but

force. immovable and steadfast.

for two millennia, christian soldiers had defended their faith against those who tried to displace it.
tonight, silas had been called to battle.

drying his wounds, he donned his ankle-length, hooded robe. it was plain, made of dark wool,

silas sat behind the wheel of the black audi the teacher had arranged for him and gazed out at the
great church of saint-sulpice. lit from beneath by banks of floodlights, the church's two bell
towers rose like stalwart sentinels above the building's long body. on either flank, a shadowy row
of sleek buttresses jutted out like the ribs of a beautiful beast.

parking the audi on the deserted place saint-sulpice, silas exhaled, telling himself to clear his
mind for the task at hand. his broad back still ached from the corporal mortification he had



endured earlier today, and yet the pain was inconsequential compared with the anguish of his life
before opus dei had saved him.

still, the memories haunted his soul.

you must allow silas to answer only to me for several days. the two of you will not speak. i will
communicate with him through secure channels."

"you will treat him with respect?"

he felt a renewed confidence that the teacher and silas would not fail. money and faith were



powerful motivators.

the barbed cilice belt to cut painfully into his flesh.

the lust evaporated instantly. for ten years now, silas had faithfully denied himself all sexual
indulgence, even self-administered. it was the way. he knew he had sacrificed much to follow
opus dei, but he had received much more in return. a vow of celibacy and the relinquishment of
all personal assets hardly seemed a sacrifice. considering the poverty from which he had come and
the sexual horrors he had endured in prison, celibacy was a welcome change.

the measure of your faith is the measure of the pain you can endure, the teacher had told him.
silas was no stranger to pain and felt eager to prove himself to the teacher, the one who had
assured him his actions were ordained by a higher power.

"hago la obra de dios, " silas whispered, moving now toward the church entrance.

pausing in the shadow of the massive doorway, he took a deep breath. it was not until this instant
that he truly realized what he was about to do, and what awaited him inside.

tonight, the cavernous nave of saint-sulpice was as silent as a tomb, the only hint of life the faint
smell of incense from mass earlier that evening. silas sensed an uneasiness in sister sandrine's
demeanor as she led him into the sanctuary. he was not surprised by this. silas was accustomed to
people being uncomfortable with his appearance.

"you're an american," she said.

"french by birth," silas responded. "i had my calling in spain, and i now study in the united
states."

sister sandrine nodded. she was a small woman with quiet eyes. "and you have never seen saint-

"i am certain. nonetheless, i am grateful that you would provide me this opportunity tonight."

"the abbe requested it. you obviously have powerful friends."

you have no idea, silas thought.

as he followed sister sandrine down the main aisle, silas was surprised by the austerity of the
sanctuary. unlike notre dame with its colorful frescoes, gilded altar-work, and warm wood, saint-
sulpice was stark and cold, conveying an almost barren quality reminiscent of the ascetic
cathedrals of spain. the lack of decor made the interior look even more expansive, and as silas
gazed up into the soaring ribbed vault of the ceiling, he imagined he was standing beneath the hull
of an enormous overturned ship.

to get to work, silas wished sister sandrine would leave him. she was a small woman whom silas
could incapacitate easily, but he had vowed not to use force unless absolutely necessary. she is a
woman of the cloth, and it is not her fault the brotherhood chose her church as a hiding place for
their keystone. she should not be punished for the sins of others.

"i am embarrassed, sister, that you were awoken on my behalf."

"not at all. you are in paris a short time. you should not miss saint-sulpice. are your interests in
the church more architectural or historical?"



"actually, sister,

she gave a pleasant laugh. "that goes without saying. i simply wondered where to begin your
tour."

silas felt his eyes focus on the altar. "a tour is unnecessary. you have been more than kind. i can
show myself around. "

"it is no trouble," she said. "after all, i am awake."

silas stopped walking. they had reached the front pew now, and the altar was only fifteen yards
away. he turned his massive body fully toward the small woman, and he could sense her recoil as
she gazed up into his red eyes. "if it does not seem too rude, sister, i am not accustomed to simply
walking into a house of god and taking a tour. would you mind if i took some time alone to pray
before i look around?"

sister sandrine hesitated. "oh, of course. i shall wait in the rear of the church for you."

silas put a soft but heavy hand on her shoulder and peered down. "sister, i feel guilty already for
having awoken you. to ask you to stay awake is too much. please, you should return to bed. i can
enjoy your sanctuary and then let myself out."

she looked uneasy. "are you sure you won't feel abandoned?"

"not at all. prayer is a solitary joy."

"as you wish."

silas took his hand from her shoulder. "sleep well, sister. may the peace of the lord be with you."

"and also with you." sister sandrine headed for the stairs. "please be sure the door closes tightly
on your way out."

"i will be sure of it." silas watched her climb out of sight. then he turned and knelt in the front
pew, feeling the cilice cut into his leg.

he stared back in the direction from which he had come.

he knew it didn't matter.

without hesitation, langdon broke into a sprint back toward the stairs.



chapter 22

kneeling in the first pew, silas pretended to pray as he scanned the layout of the sanctuary. saint-
sulpice, like most churches, had been built in the shape of a giant roman cross. its long central
section — the nave — led directly to the main altar, where it was transversely intersected by a shorter
section, known as the transept. the intersection of nave and transept occurred directly beneath the
main cupola and was considered the heart of the church... her most sacred and mystical point.

not tonight, silas thought. sa

turning his head to the right, he gazed into the south transept, toward the open area of floor beyond
the end of the pews, to the object his victims had described.

embedded in the gray granite floor, a thin polished strip of brass glistened in the stone... a golden
line slanting across the church's floor. the line bore graduated markings, like a ruler. it was a
gnomon, silas had been told, a pagan astronomical device like a sundial. tourists, scientists,
historians, and pagans from around the world came to saint-sulpice to gaze upon this famous line.

the rose line.

slowly, silas let his eyes trace the path of the brass strip as it made its way across the floor from
his right to left, slanting in front of him at an awkward angle, entirely at odds with the symmetry of
the church. slicing across the main altar itself, the line looked to silas like a slash wound acro

church, finally reaching the corner of the north transept, where it arrived at the base of a most
unexpected structure.

here, the glistening rose line took a ninety-degree vertical turn and continued directly up the face
of the obelisk itself, ascending thirty-three feet to the very tip of the pyramidical apex, where it
finally ceased.



the rose line, silas thought. the brotherhood hid the keystone at the rose line.

earlier tonight, when silas told the teacher that the priory keystone was hidden inside saint-
sulpice, the teacher had sounded doubtful. but when silas added that the brothers had all given
him a precise location, with relation to a brass line running through saint-sulpice, the teacher had
gasped with revelation. "you speak of the rose line!"

the teacher quickly told silas of saint-sulpice's famed architectural oddity — a strip of

but it had not always been.

long before the establishment of greenwich as the prime meridian, the zero longitude of the entire
world had passed directly through paris, and through the church of saint-sulpice. the brass
marker in saint-sulpice was a memorial to the world's first prime meridian, and although
greenwich had stripped paris of the honor in 1888, the original rose line was still visible today.

"and so the legend is true," the teacher had told silas. "the priory keystone has been said to lie
'beneath the sign of the rose.' "

now, still on his knees in a pew, silas glanced around the church and listened to make sure no one
was there. for a moment, he thought he heard a rustling in the choir balcony. he turned and gazed

silas smiled. his victims had spoken the truth.

standing, he searched the sanctuary for something with which to break the floor tile.



high above silas, in the balcony, sister sandrine stifled a gasp. her darkest fears had just been
confirmed. this visitor was not who he seemed. the mysterious opus dei monk had come to saint-

felt a sting as the wool fibers stuck to the fresh wounds on his back.

naked now, except for his loin swaddle, silas wrapped his cloak over the end of the iron rod. then,
aiming at the center of the floor tile, he drove the tip into it. a muffled thud. the stone did not
break. he drove the pole into it again. again a dull thud, but this time accompanied by a crack. on

at first he felt nothing. the floor of the compartment was bare, smooth stone. then, feeling deeper,
reaching his arm in under the rose line, he touched something! a thick stone tablet. getting his
fingers around the edge, he gripped it and gently lifted the tablet out. as he stood and examined his
find, he realized he was holding a rough-hewn stone slab with engraved words. he felt for an
instant like a modern-day moses.

as silas read the words on the tablet, he felt surprise. he had expected the keystone to be a map, or
a complex series of directions, perhaps even encoded. the keystone, however, bore the simplest of
inscriptions.

the bloody monk was now quietly donning his cloak again, clutching his prize as he moved toward
the altar, toward the bible.

in breathless silence, sister sandrine left the balcony and raced down the hall to her quarters.
getting on her hands and knees, she reached beneath her wooden bed frame and retrieved the
sealed envelope she had hidden there years ago.

tearing it open, she found four paris phone numbers.

trembling, she began to dial.



downstairs, silas laid the stone tablet on the altar and turned his eager hands to the leather bible.

testament, he found the book of job. he located chapter thirty-eight. as he ran his finger down the

from now! he had thought. god help us!



now, seated in the fiat, bishop aringarosa realized his fists were clenched just thinking about that
first meeting. he released his grip and forced a slow inhalation, relaxing his muscles.

everything will be fine, he told himself as the fiat wound higher into the mountains. still, he
wished his cell phone would ring. why hasn't the teacher called me? silas should have the
keystone by now.

trying to ease his nerves, the bishop meditated on the purple amethyst in his ring. feeling the
textures of the mitre-crozier applique and the facets of the diamonds, he reminded himself that this
ring was a symbol of power far less than that which he would soon attain.

"i tried to warn you," he shouted over the sound of gnashing gears. "i drive an automatic!"

silas had been tricked. the brothers had lied, choosing death instead of revealing their true secret.
silas did not have the strength to call the teacher. not only had silas killed the only four people
who knew where the keystone was hidden, he had killed a nun inside saint-sulpice. she was
working against god! she scorned the work of opus dei!

ated matters greatly. bishop aringarosa had placed
the phone call that got silas into saint-sulpice; what would the abbe think when he discovered the
nun was dead? although silas had placed her back in her bed, the wound on her head was obvious.
silas had attempted to replace the broken tiles in the floor, but that damage too was obvious. they
would know someone had been there.

silas had planned to hide within opus dei when his task here was complete. bishop aringarosa
will protect me. silas could imagine no more blissful existence than a life of meditation and prayer
deep within the walls of opus dei's headquarters in new york city. he would never again set foot
outside. everything he needed was within that sanctuary. nobody will miss me. unfortunately,
silas knew, a prominent man like bishop aringarosa could not disappear so easily.

"my friend," aringarosa had told him, "you were born an albino. do not let others shame you for
this. do you not understand how special this makes you? were you not aware that noah himself
was an albino?"



"noah of the ark?" silas had never heard this.

aringarosa was smiling. "indeed, noah of the ark. an albino. like you, he had skin white like an
angel. consider this. noah saved all of life on the planet. you are destined for great things, silas.
the lord has freed you for a reason. you have your calling. the lord needs your help to do his

struggling with the gear shift, langdon managed to maneuver the hijacked taxi to the far side of
the bois de boulogne while stalling only twice. unfortunately, the inherent humor in the situation
was overshadowed by the taxi dispatcher repeatedly hailing their cab over the radio.

silas lay prone on the canvas mat in his room, allowing the lash wounds on his back to clot in the
air. tonight's second session with the discipline had left him dizzy and weak. he had yet to
remove the cilice belt, and he could feel the blood trickling down his inner thigh. still, he could not
justify removing the strap.

"but this is impossible!" silas had cried out. "i cannot accept it!"



"it is true," aringarosa said. "unthinkable, but true. in only six months."

the bishop's words terrified silas. he prayed for deliverance, and even in those dark days, his trust
in god and the way never wavered. it was only a month later that the clouds parted miraculously
and the light of possibility shone through.

the bishop had seemed hopeful for the first time. "silas," he whispered, "god has bestowed upon
us an opportunity to protect the way. our battle, like all battles, will take sacrifice. will you be a

said, "i am a lamb of god. shepherd me as your heart commands."

when aringarosa described the opportunity that had presented itself, silas knew it could only be
the hand of god at work. miraculous fate! aringarosa put silas in contact with the man who had
proposed the plan — a man who called himself the teacher. although the teacher and silas never
met face-to-face, each time they spoke by phone, silas was awed, both by the profundity of the
teacher's faith and by the scope of his power. the teacher seemed to be a man who knew all, a
man with eyes and ears in all places. how the teacher gathered his information, silas did not
know, but aringarosa had placed enormous trust in the teacher, and he had told silas to do the
same. "do as the teacher commands you," the bishop told silas. "and we will be victorious."

silas wished he could call bishop aringarosa and warn him, but the teacher had removed all their
lines of direct communication tonight. for our safety.

finally, overcoming enormous trepidation, silas crawled to his feet and found his robe, which lay
on the floor. he dug his cell phone from the pocket. hanging his head in shame, he dialed.

"teacher," he whispered, "all is lost." silas truthfully told the man how he had been tricked.

"you lose your faith too quickly," the teacher replied. "i have just received news. most
unexpected and welcome. the secret lives. jacques sauniere transferred information before he
died. i will call you soon. our work tonight is not yet done."

redeem his skepticism and earlier blunders. he was about to make the most high-profile arrest of
his career.

collet radioed the five cars accompanying him. "no sirens, men. langdon can't know we're
coming."



forty kilometers away, a black audi pulled off a rural road and parked in the shadows on the edge
of a field. silas got out and peered through the rungs of the wrought-iron fence that encircled the
vast compound before him. he gazed up the long moonlit slope to the chateau in the distance.

the downstairs lights were all ablaze. odd for this hour, silas thought, smiling. the information
the teacher had given him was obviously accurate. / will not leave this house without the keystone,
he vowed. / will not fail the bishop and the teacher.

checking the thirteen-round clip in his heckler koch, silas pushed it

chapter 58

teabing's "study" was like no study sophie had ever seen. six or seven times larger than even the
most luxurious of office spaces, the knight's cabinet de travail resembled an ungainly hybrid of

boundless tile floor was dotted with clustered islands of worktables buried beneath books, artwork,
artifacts, and a surprisi

the servant's jaw dropped. "sir? i must protest. these people are — "

"i'll handle this." teabing pointed to the hallway.

after a moment of stunned silence, remy skulked out like a banished dog.

in the cool night breeze coming through the open doors, teabing turned back to sophie and
langdon, his expression still wary. "this better be good. what do you know of the keystone?"



in the thick brush outside teabing's study, silas clutched his pistol and gazed through the glass
doors. only moments ago, he had circled the house and seen langdon and the woman talking in
the large study. before he could move in, a man on crutches entered, yelled at langdon, threw
open the doors, and demanded his guests leave. then the woman mentioned the keystone, and
everything changed. shouts turned to whispers. moods softened. and the glass doors were quickly
closed.

now, as he huddled in the shadows, silas peered through the glass. the

inside the house. silas could feel it.

staying in the shadows, he inched closer to the glass, eager to hear what was being said. he would
give them five minutes. if they did not reveal where they had placed the keystone, silas would
have to enter and persuade them with force.



inside the study, langdon could sense their host's bewilderment.



"grand master?" teabing choked, eyeing sophie. "jacques sauniere?"

sophie nodded, seeing the shock in his eyes.

"but you could not possibly know that!"

"jacques sauniere was my grandfather."

teabing staggered back on his crutches, shooting a glance at langdon, who nodded. teabing
turned back to sophie. "miss neveu, i am speechless. if this is true, then i am truly sorry f

"then they will be too late," sophie said. "we removed the keystone."

"what! you removed the keystone from its hiding place?"

"don't worry," langdon said. "the keystone is well hidden."

"extremely well hidden, i hope ! "

"actually," langdon said, unable to hide his grin, "that depends on how often you dust under your
couch."



the wind outside chateau villette had picked up, and silas's robe danced in the breeze as he
crouched near the window. although he had been unable to hear much of the conversation, the
word keystone had sifted through the glass on numerous occasions.

it is inside.

the teacher's words were fresh in his mind. enter chateau villette. take the keystone. hun no

now, langdon and the others had adjourned suddenly to another room, extinguishing the study
lights as they went. feeling like a panther stalking prey, silas crept to the glass doors. finding

the monk closed to within a few feet, keeping the gun aimed directly at teabing's head. sophie
watched, feeling helpless as the monk reached out to take the cylinder.

"you will not succeed," teabing said. "only the worthy can unlock this stone."



god alone judges the worthy, silas thought.

"it's quite heavy," the man on crutches said, his arm wavering now. "if you don't take it soon, i'm
afraid i shall drop it!" he swayed perilously.

silas stepped quickly forward to take the stone, and as he did, the man on crutches lost his balance.
the crutch slid out from under him, and he began to topple sideways to his right. no! silas lunged
to save the stone, lowering his weapon in the process. but the keystone was moving away from
him now. as the man fell to his right, his left

 hand swung backward, and the cylinder tumbled from
his palm onto the couch. at the same instant, the metal crutch that had been sliding out from under
the man seemed to accelerate, cutting a wide arc through the air toward silas's leg.

splinters of pain tore up silas's body as the crutch made perfect contact with his cilice, crushing the
barbs into his already raw flesh. buckling, silas crumpled to his knees, causing the belt to cut
deeper still. the pistol discharged with a deafening roar, the bullet burying itself harmlessly in the
floorboards as silas fell. before he could raise the gun and fire again, the woman's foot caught him
square beneath the jaw.

veins. with fache on the way, collet had already relinquished any hopes of claiming personal

while and felt an unexpected upwelling of contentment. despite his troubles tonight, langdon was
thankful to have landed in such good company.

after several minutes, as if suddenly sensing his eyes on her, sophie leaned forward and put her
hands on his shoulders, giving him a quick rub. "you okay?"

"yeah," langdon said. "somehow."

sophie sat back in her seat, and langdon saw a quiet smile cross her lips. he realized that he too
was now grinning.



wedged in the back of the range rover, silas could barely breathe. his arms were wrenched
backward and heavily lashed to his ankles with kitchen twine and duct tape. every bump in the
road sent pain shooting through his twisted shoulders. at least his captors had removed the cilice.
unable to inhale through the strip of tape over his mouth, he could only breathe through his
nostrils, which were slowly clogging up due to the dusty rear cargo area into which he had been
crammed. he began coughing.

"i think he's choking," the french driver

said, sounding concerned.

the british man who had struck silas with his crutch now turned and peered over the seat,
frowning coldly at silas. "fortunately for you, we british judge man's civility not by his
compassion for his friends, but by his compassion for his enemies." the brit reached down and
grabbed the duct tape on silas's mouth. in one fast motion, he tore it off.



silas felt as if his lips had just caught fire, but the air pouring into his lungs was sent from god.

"whom do you work for?" the british man demanded.

"i do the work of god," silas spat back through the pain in his jaw where the woman had kicked
him.

"you belong to opus dei," the man said. it was not a question.

"you know nothing of who i am."

"why does opus dei want the keystone?"

silas had no intention of answering. the keystone was the link to the holy grail, and the holy
grail was the key

now, in the range rover, struggling against his bonds, silas feared he had failed the teacher and
the bishop forever. he had no way even to contact them and tell them the terrible turn of events.
my captors have the keystone! they will reach the grail before we do! in the stifling darkness,
silas prayed. he let the pain of his body fuel his supplications.

"robert?" sophie was still watching him. "a funny look just crossed your face."

langdon glanced back at her, realizing his jaw was firmly set and his heart was racing. an
incredible notion had just occurred to him. could it really be that simple an explanation? "i need to
use your cell phone, sophie."

"now?"

"i think i just figured something out."

"what?"

"i'll tell you in a minute. i need your phone."

the chartered turboprop was just passing over the twinkling lights of monaco when aringarosa
hung up on fache for the second time. he reached for the airsickness bag again but felt too drained
even to be sick.

fache's newest update seemed unfathomable, and yet almost nothing tonight made sense anymore.

on shaky legs, aringarosa walked to the cockpit. "i need to change destinations."

the pilot glanced over his shoulder and laughed. "you're joking, right?"

"no. i have to get to london immediately."

"father, this is a charter flight, not a taxi."



"i will pay you extra, of course. how much? london is only one hour farther north and requires
almost no change of direction, so — "

searching the bar, remy found a standard service wine-opener and flicked open the sharp blade.
the knife was usually employed to slice the lead foil from corks on fine bottles of wine, but it
would serve a far more dramatic purpose this morning. remy turned and faced silas, holding up
the glimmering blade.

now those red eyes flashed fear.

remy smiled and moved toward the back of the limousine. the monk recoiled, struggling against
his bonds.

"be still," remy whispered, raising the blade.

silas felt the biting warmth spreading across his back and shoulders and could picture his own
blood, spilling out over his flesh. a piercing pain cut through his thighs now, and he felt the onset
of that familiar undertow of disorientation — the body's defense mechanism against the pain.

as the biting heat tore through all of his muscles now, silas clenched his eyes tighter, determined
that the final image of his life would not be of his own killer. instead he pictured a younger bishop

circulation."

silas's eyes flew open in surprise. a blurry image was leaning over him, offering a glass of liquid.
a mound of shredded duct tape lay on the floor beside the bloodless knife.

"drink this," he repeated. "the pain you feel is the blood rushing into your muscles."

silas felt the fiery throb transforming now to a prickling sting. the vodka tasted terrible, but he
drank it, feeling grateful. fate had dealt silas a healthy share of bad luck tonight, but god had
solved it all with one miraculous twist.

"i had wanted to free you earlier," the servant apologized, "but it was impossible. with the police

silas recoiled, startled. "you know my name?"

the servant smiled.

silas sat up now, rubbing his stiff muscles, his emotions a torrent of incredulity, appreciation, and
confusion. "are you... the teacher?"

remy shook his head, laughing at the proposition. "i wish i had that kind of power. no, i am not
the teacher. like you, i serve him. but the teacher speaks highly of you. my name is remy."



silas was amazed. "i don't understand. if you work for the teacher, why did langdon bring the

remy smiled, seeming to have no trouble with the apparent coincidence of langdon's chosen
refuge. "it was all utterly predictable. robert langdon was in possession of the keystone, and he
needed help. what more logical place to run than to the home of leigh teabing? that i happen to
live there is why the teacher approached me in the first place." he paused. "how do you think the
teacher knows so much about the grail?"

now it dawned, and silas was stunned. the teacher had recruited a servant who had access to all
of sir leigh teabing's research. it was brilliant.

"there is much i have to tell you," remy said, handing silas the loaded heckler koch pistol. then
he reached through the open partition and retrieved a small, palm-sized revolver from the glove
box. "but first, you and i have a job to do."

fache sat up. "i thought you were going to paris."

"i am deeply concerned. i have changed my plans."

"you should not have."

"do you have silas?"

"no. his captors eluded the local police before i landed."

aringarosa's anger rang sharply. "you assured me you would stop that plane!"

fache lowered his voice. "bishop, considering your situation, i recommend you not test my

chapter 86

like a ghost, silas drifted silently behind his target. sophie neveu sensed him too late. before she
could turn, silas pressed the gun barrel into her spine and wrapped a powerful arm across her chest,
pulling her back against his hulking body. she yelled in surprise. teabing and langdon both turned
now, their expressions astonished and fearful.

"what...?" teabing choked out. "what did you do to remy!"

"your only concern," silas said calmly, "is that i leave here with the keystone." this recovery
mission, as rem

y had described it, was to be clean and simple: enter the church, take the keystone,
and walk out; no killing, no struggle.

holding sophie firm, silas dropped his hand from her chest, down to her waist, slipping it inside
her deep sweater pockets, searching. he could smell the soft fragrance of her hair through his own
alcohol-laced breath. "where is it?" he whispered. the keystone was in her sweater pocket earlier.
so where is it now?

"it's over here," langdon's deep voice resonated from across the room.

silas turned to see langdon holding the black cryptex before him, waving it back and forth like a
matador tempting a dumb animal.

"set i

t down," silas demanded.

"let sophie and leigh leave the church," langdon replied. "you and i can settle this."



silas pushed sophie away from him and aimed the gun at langdon, moving toward him.

"not a step closer," langdon said. "not until they leave the building."

"you are in no position to make demands."

"i disagree." langdon raised the cryptex high over his head. "i will not hesitate to smash this on the
floor and break the vial inside."

although silas sneered outwardly at the threat, he felt a flash of fear. this was unexpected. he
aimed the gun at langdon's head and kept his voice as steady as his hand. "you would never break
the keystone. you want to find the grail as much as i do."



you're wrong. you want it much more. you've proven you're willing to kill for it."



forty feet away, peering out from the annex pews near the archway, remy legaludec felt a rising
alarm. the maneuver had not gone as planned, and even from here, he could se

e silas was
uncertain how to handle the situation. at the teacher's orders, remy had forbidden silas to fire his
gun.

"let them go," langdon again demanded, holding the cryptex high over his head and staring into
silas's gun.

the monk's red eyes filled with anger and frustration, and remy tightened with fear that silas
might actually shoot langdon while he was holding the cryptex. the cryptex cannot fall!

the cryptex was to be remy's ticket to freedom and wealth. a little over a year ago, he was simply
a fifty-five-year-old manservant living within the walls of chateau villette, catering to the whims
of the insufferable cripple sir leigh teabing. then he was approached with an extraordinary
proposition. remy's association with sir leigh teabing — the preeminent grail historian on
earth — was going to bri

only one who knew the teacher's identity.

"are you certain you want silas to carry out this task?" remy had asked the teacher less than half



an hour ago, upon getting orders to steal the keystone. "i myself am capable."

the teacher was resolute. "silas served us well with the four priory members. he will recover the
keystone. you must remain anonymous. if others see you, they will need to be eliminated, and there
has been enough killing already. do not reveal your face."

"understood," remy said. "i will assist silas from the shadows."

"for your own knowledge, remy," the teacher had told him, "the tomb in question is not in the
temple church. so have no fear. they are looking in the wrong place."

remy was stunned. "and you know where the tomb is?"

"of course. later, i will tell you. for the moment, you must act quickly. if the others figure out the
true location of the tomb and leave the church before you take the cryptex, we could lose the grail
forever."

remy didn't give a damn about the grail, except

"arrogant fools," remy sneered. "have you not noticed that i have been listening tonight as you

you. you are not even looking in the right place. the tomb you seek is in another location
entirely!"

teabing felt panicked. what is he saying!

"why do you want the grail?" langdon demanded. "to destroy it? before the end of days?"

remy called to the monk. "silas, take the keystone from mr. langdon."

as the monk advanced, langdon stepped back, raising the keystone high, looking fully prepared to
hurl it at the floor.

"i would rather break it," langdon said, "than see it in the wrong hands."

teabing now felt a wave of horror. he could see his life's work evaporating before his eyes. all his
dreams about to be shattered.

the gunshot echoing like thunder inside the stone chamber.

everyone froze.

"i am not playing games," remy said. "the next one is in his back. hand the keystone to silas."

langdon reluctantly held out the cryptex. silas stepped forward and took it, his red eyes gleaming
with the self-satisfaction of vengeance. slipping the keystone in the pocket of his robe, silas
backed off, still holding langdon and sophie at gunpoint.



teabing felt remy's arm clamp hard around his neck as the servant began backing out of the
building, dragging teabing with him, the gun still pressed in his back.

"let him go," langdon demanded.

"we're taking mr. teabing for a drive," remy said, still backing up. "if you call the police, he will
die. if you do anything to interfere, he will die. is that clear?"

"take me," langdon demanded, his voice cracking with emotion. "let leig

remy laughed. "i don't think so. he and i have such a nice history. besides, he still might prove
useful."

silas was backing up now, keeping langdon and sophie at gunpoint as remy pulled leigh toward
the exit, his crutches dragging behind him.

sophie's voice was unwavering. "who are you working for?"

the question brought a smirk to the departing remy's face. "you would be surprised,
mademoiselle neveu."

if langdon were to have any chance of helping leigh, or of ever seeing the keystone again, it was
essential that he find the tomb first. unfortunately, remy has a big head start.

slowing remy down had become sophie's task.

finding the right tomb had become langdon's.

sophie would make remy and silas fugitives of the london police, forcing them into hiding or,
better yet, catching them. langdon's plan was less certain — to take the tube to nearby king's
college, which was renowned for its electronic theological database. the ultimate research tool,
langdon had heard. instant answers to any religious historical question. he wondered what the
database would have to say about "a knight a pope interred."

he stood up and paced, wishing the train would hurry.

chapter 91

silas sat in the passenger seat of the parked jaguar limousine near the temple church. his hands
felt damp on the keystone as he waited for remy to finish tying and gagging teabing in back with
the rope they had found in the trunk.

finally, remy climbed out of the rear of the limo, walked around, and slid into the driver's seat
beside silas.

"secure?" silas asked.

remy chuckled, shaking off the rain and glancing over his shoulder through the open partition at
the crumpled form of leigh teabing, wh

o was barely visible in the shadows in the rear. "he's not
going anywhere."

silas could hear teabing's muffled cries and realized remy had used some of the old duct tape to
gag him.

"ferme ta gueule!" remy shouted over his shoulder at teabing. reaching to a control panel on the
elaborate dash, remy pressed a button. an opaque partition raised behind them, sealing off the
back. teabing disappeared, and his voice was silenced. remy glanced at silas. "i've been listening
to his miserable whimpering long enough."



minutes later, as the jaguar stretch limo powered through the streets, silas's cell phone rang. the
teacher. he answered excitedly. "hello?"



"silas," the teacher's familiar french accent said, "i am relieved to hear your voice. this means
you are safe."

silas was equally comforted to hear the teacher. it had been hours, and the operation had veered
wildly off course. now, at last, it seemed to be back on track. "i have the k

eystone."

"this is superb news," the teacher told him. "is remy with you?"

silas was surprised to hear the teacher use remy's name. "yes. remy freed me."

"as i ordered him to do. i am only sorry you had to endure captivity for so long."

"physical discomfort has no meaning. the important thing is that the keystone is ours."

"yes. i need it delivered to me at once. time is of the essence."

silas was eager to meet the teacher face-to-face at last. "yes, sir, i would be honored."

"silas, i would like remy to bring it to me."

remy? silas was crestfallen. after everything silas had done for the teacher, he had believed he
would be the one to hand over the prize. the teacher favors remy?

"i sense your disappointment," the teacher said, "which tells me you do not understand my
meaning." he lowered his voice to a whisper. "you must believe that i would much prefer to
receive the keystone from you — a man of god rather than a criminal — but remy must be dealt
with. he disobeye
 
 ___________________________
 
d my orders and made a grave mistake that has put our entire mission at risk. "

silas felt a chill and glanced over at remy. kidnapping teabing had not been part of the plan, and
deciding what to do with him posed a new problem.

"you and i are men of god," the teacher whispered. "we cannot be deterred from our goal." there
was an ominous pause on the line. "for this reason alone, i will ask remy to bring me the
keystone. do you understand?"

silas sensed anger in the teacher's voice and was surprised the man was not more understanding.
showing his face could not be avoided, silas thought. remy did what he had to do. he saved the
keystone. "i understand," silas managed.

"good. for your own safety, you need to get off the street immediately. the police will be looking
for the limousine soon, and i do not want you caught. opus dei has a residence in london, no?"

"of course."



"and you are welcome there?"

"as a brother."

"then go there

 and stay out of sight. i will call you the moment i am in possession of the keystone

"you are in london?"

"do as i say, and everything will be fine."

"yes, sir."

the teacher heaved a sigh, as if what he now had to do was profoundly regrettable. "it's time i
speak to remy."

silas handed remy the phone, sensing it might be the last call remy legaludec ever took.



as remy took the phone, he knew this poor, twisted monk had no idea what fate awaited him now
that he had served his purpose.

the teacher used you, silas.

remy still marveled at the teacher's powers of persuasion. bishop aringarosa had trusted
everything. he had been blinded by his own desperation. aringarosa was far too eager to believe.

london's opus dei centre is a modest brick building at 5 orme court, overlooking the north walk
at kensington gardens. silas had never been here, but he felt a rising sense of refuge and asylum as
he approached the building on foot. despite the rain, remy had dropped him off a short distance
away in order to keep the limousine off the main streets. silas didn't mind the walk. the rain was
cleansing.

at remy's suggestion, silas had wiped down his gun and disposed of it through a sewer grate. he

reater pain. he wondered, though, about teabing, whom remy had left
bound in the back of the limousine. the briton certainly had to be feeling the pain by now.

"what will you do with him?" silas had asked remy as they drove over here.

remy had shrugged. "that is a decision for the teacher." there was an odd finality in his tone.

now, as silas approached the opus dei building, the rain began to fall harder, soaking his heavy
robe, stinging the wounds of the day before. he was ready to leave behind the sins of the last
twenty-four hours and purge his soul. his work was done.

moving across a small courtyard to the front door, silas was not surprised to find the door
unlocked. he opened it and stepped into the minimalist foyer. a muted electronic chime sounded
upstairs as silas stepped onto the carpet. the bell was a common feature in

these halls where the
residents spent most of the day in their rooms in prayer. silas could hear movement above on the
creaky wood floors.

a man in a cloak came downstairs. "may i help you?" he had kind eyes that seemed not even to
register silas's startling physical appearance.

"thank you. my name is silas. i am an opus dei numerary."

"american?"

silas nodded. "i am in town only for the day. might i rest here?"

"you need not even ask. there are two empty rooms on the third floor. shall i bring you some tea
and bread?"

"thank you." silas was famished.

silas went upstairs to a modest room with a window, where he took off his wet robe and knelt
down to pray in his undergarments. he heard his host come up and lay a tray outside his door. silas



finished his prayers, ate his food, and lay down to sleep.

silas awoke with a start.

he had no idea what had awoken him or how long he had been asleep. was i dreaming? sitting up
now on his straw mat, he listened to the quiet breathing of the opus dei residence hall, the stillness
textured only by the soft murmurs of someone praying aloud in a room below him. these were



familiar sounds and should have comforted him.

and yet he felt a sudden and unexpected wariness.

standing, wearing only his undergarments, silas walked to the window. was i followed? th

why am i uneasy? long ago silas had learned to trust his intuition. intuition had kept him alive as a
child on the streets of marseilles long before prison... long before he was born again by the hand of
bishop aringarosa. peering out the window, he now saw the faint outline of a car through the
hedge. on the car's roof was a police siren. a floorboard creaked in the hallway. a door latch
moved.

silas reacted on instinct, surging across the room and sliding to a stop just behind the door as it
crashed open. the first police officer stormed through, swinging his gun left then right at what
appeared an empty room. before he realized where silas was, silas had thrown his shoulder into
the door, crushing a second officer as he came through. as the first officer wheeled to shoot, silas
dove for his legs. the gun went off, the bullet sailing above silas's head, just as he connected with

r's shins, driving his legs out from under him, and sending the man down, his head hitting
the floor. the second officer staggered to his feet in the doorway, and silas drove a knee into his
groin, then went clambering over the writhing body into the hall.

almost naked, silas hurled his pale body down the staircase. he knew he had been betrayed, but by
whom? when he reached the foyer, more officers were surging through the front door. silas turned
the other way and dashed deeper into the residence hall. the women 's entrance. every opus dei
building has one. winding down narrow hallways, silas snaked through a kitchen, past terrified
workers, who left to avoid the naked albino as he knocked over bowls and silverware, bursting into
a dark hallway near the boiler room. he now saw the door he sought, an exit light gleaming at the
end.

running full speed through the door out into the rain, silas leapt off the low landing, not seeing

officer coming the other way until it was too late. the two men collided, silas's broad, naked
shoulder grinding into the man's sternum with crushing force. he drove the officer backward onto
the pavement, landing hard on top of him. the officer's gun clattered away. silas could hear men
running down the hall shouting. rolling, he grabbed the loose gun just as the officers emerged. a
shot rang out on the stairs, and silas felt a searing pain below his ribs. filled with rage, he opened
fire at all three officers, their blood spraying.

a dark shadow loomed behind, coming out of nowhere. the angry hands that grabbed at his bare
shoulders felt as if they were infused with the power of the devil himself. the man roared in his
ear. silas, no!

silas spun and fired. their eyes met. silas was already screaming in horror as bishop aringarosa
fell.

"you would not tell me?" teabing sighed. "i am disappointed and surprised, robert, that you do
not appreciate the extent to which you are in my debt. my task would have been far simpler had
remy and i eliminated you both when you walked into chateau villette. instead i risked
everything to take the nobler course."

"this is noble?" langdon demanded, eyeing the gun.

"sauniere's fault," teabing said. "he and his senechaux lied to silas. otherwise, i would have
obtained the keystone without complication. how was i to imagine the grand master would go to
such ends to deceive me and bequeath the keystone to an estranged granddaughter?" teabing
looked at sophie with disdain. "someone so unqualified to hold this knowledge that she required a
symbologist baby-sitter." teabing glanced back at langdon. "fortunately, robert, your
involvement turned out to be my saving grace. rather than the keystone remaining locked in the

information on where to find it, i was not sure. but with the police on your heels, i had a sneaking



suspicion you might arrive on my doorstep."

langdon glared. "and if we had not?"

"i was formulating a plan to extend you a helping hand. one way or another, the keystone was
coming to chateau villette. the fact that you delivered it into my waiting hands only serves as
proof that my cause is just."

"what!" langdon was appalled.

"silas was supposed to break in and steal the keystone from you in chateau villette — thus
removing you from the equation without hurting you, and exonerating me from any suspicion of
complicity. however, when i saw the intricacy of sauniere's codes, i decided to include you both in
my quest a bit longer. i could have silas steal the keystone later, once i knew enough to carry on
alone."

"the temple church," sophie said, her tone awash with betrayal.

mple church was the perfect location to steal the
keystone from robert and sophie, and its apparent relevance to the poem made it a plausible
decoy. remy's orders had been clear — stay out of sight while silas recovers the keystone.
unfortunately, langdon's threat to smash the keystone on the chapel floor had caused remy to
panic. if only remy had not revealed himself, teabing thought ruefully, recalling his own mock
kidnapping. remy was the sole link to me, and he showed his face!

fortunately, silas remained unaware of teabing's true identity and was easily fooled into taking
him from the church and then watching naively as remy pretended to tie their hostage in the back
of the limousine. with the

every grail quest requires sacrifice. the cleanest solution had been staring teabing in the face

bottom of the can would be more than enough to trigger remy's deadly allergy. when remy

bishop manuel aringarosa's body had endured many kinds of pain, and yet the searing heat of the
bullet wound in his chest felt profoundly foreign to him. deep and grave. not a wound of the
flesh... but closer to the soul.

he opened his eyes, trying to see, but the rain on his face blurred his vision. where am i? he could
feel powerful arms holding him, carrying his limp body like a rag doll, his black cassock flapping.



lifting a weary arm, he mopped his eyes and saw the man holding him was silas. the great albino
was struggling down a misty sidewalk, shouting for a hospital, his voice a heartrending wail of
agony. his red eyes were focused dead ahead, tears streaming down his pale, blood- spattered face.

"my son," aringarosa whispered, "you're hurt."

silas glanced down, his visage contorted in anguish. "i am so very sorry, father." he seemed
almost too pained to speak.

"no, silas," aringarosa replied. "it is i who am sorry. this is my fault." the teacher promised me

reel back in time. to spain. to his modest beginnings, building a small catholic church in oviedo
with silas. and later, to new york city, where he had proclaimed the glory of god with the
towering opus dei center on lexington avenue.

five months ago, aringarosa had received devastating news. his life's work was in jeopardy. he
recalled, with vivid detail, the meeting inside castel gandolfo that had changed his life... the news
that had set this entire calamity into motion.

aringarosa had entered gandolfo's astronomy library with his head held high, fully expecting to
be lauded by throngs of welcomi

you enormous power... enough power to make the vatican bow before you. enough power to save
the faith." he paused. "not just for opus dei. but for all of us."

the lord taketh away... and the lord giveth. aringarosa felt a glorious ray of hope. "tell me your
plan."



bishop aringarosa was unconscious when the doors of st. mary's hospital hissed open. silas
lurched into the entryway delirious with exhaustion. dropping to his knees on the tile floor, he
cried out for help. everyone in the reception area gaped in wonderment at the half-naked albino
offering forth a bleeding clergyman.

the doctor who helped silas heave the delirious bishop onto a gurney looked gloomy as he felt
aringarosa's pulse. "he's lost a lot of blood. i am not hopeful."

aringarosa's eyes flickered, and he returned for a moment, his gaze locating silas. "my child..."

silas's

soul thundered with remorse and rage. "father, if it takes my lifetime, i will find the one
who deceived us, and i will kill him."

aringarosa shook his head, looking sad as they prepared to wheel him away. "silas... if you have
learned nothing from me, please... learn this." he took silas's hand and gave it a firm squeeze.
"forgiveness is god's greatest gift."

"but father..."

aringarosa closed his eyes. "silas, you must pray."

n into action on the same night langdon was scheduled
to meet jacques sauniere. listening in on the curator, teabing was certain the man's eagerness to
meet privately with langdon could mean only one thing. langdon' s mysterious manuscript has
touched a nerve with the priory.

langdon has stumbled onto a truth, and sauniere fears its release. teabing felt certain the grand
master was summoning langdon to silence him.

the truth has been silenced long enough!

teabing knew he had to act quickly. silas's attack would accomplish two goals. it would prevent
sauniere from persuading langdon to keep quiet, and it would ensure that once the keystone was
in teabing's hands, langdon would be in paris for recruitment should teabing need him.

arranging the fatal meeting between sauniere and silas had been almost too easy. / had inside
information about sauniere 's deepest fears. yesterday afternoon, silas had phoned the curator and
posed as a distraught priest. "monsieur sauniere, forgive me, i must

the road into a river. "

sauniere fell silent.

"monsieur sauniere, i would never have phoned you directly except this man made a comment
which makes me now fear for your safety." he paused. "the man also mentioned your

the mention of sophie's name had been the catalyst. the curator leapt into action. he ordered silas

"it's in langdon's pocket!" teabing was screaming like a madman. "the map to the holy grail!"

as they hoisted teabing and carried him out, he threw back his head and howled. "robert! tell me



where it's hidden!"

as teabing passed, langdon looked him in the eye. "only the worthy find the grail, leigh. you

chapter 102

the mist had settled low on kensington gardens as silas limped into a quiet hollow out of sight.
kneeling on the wet grass, he could feel a warm stream of blood flowing from the bullet wound
below his ribs. still, he stared straight ahead.

the fog made it look like heaven here.

raising his bloody hands to pray, he watched the raindrops caress his fingers, turning them white
again. as the droplets fell harder across his back and shoulders, he could feel his body disappearing
bit by bit into the mist.

prayed for his mentor... bishop aringarosa... that the lord would not take him before his time. he
has so much work left to do.

the fog was swirling around him now, and silas felt so light that he was sure the wisps would
carry him away. closing his eyes, he said a final prayer.

from somewhere in the mist, the voice of manuel aringarosa whispered to him.

our lord is a good and merciful god.

silas's pain at last began to fade, and he knew the bishop was right.

the st. mary's hospital recovery room was sunny.

"you've impressed us all," the nurse said, smiling down at him. "nothing short of miraculous."

bishop aringarosa gave a weak smile. "i have always been blessed."

the nurse finished puttering, leaving the bishop alone. the sunlight felt welcome and warm on his
face. last night had been the darkest night of his life.

despondently, he thought of silas, whose body had been found in the park.

please forgive me, my son.

aringarosa had longed for silas to be part of his glorious plan. last night, however, aringarosa had



received a call from bezu fache, questioning the bishop about his apparent connection to a nun
who had been murdered in saint-sulpice. aringarosa realized the evening had taken a horrifying
turn. news of the four additional murders transformed his horror to anguish. silas, what have you

stop the horrific chain of events he had helped put in motion was to confess everything to fache,
and from that moment on, aringarosa and fache had been racing to catch up with silas before the
teacher persuaded him to kill again.

feeling bone weary, aringarosa closed his eyes and listened to the television coverage of the arrest
of a prominent british knight, sir leigh teabing. the teacher laid bare for all to see. teabing had
caught wind of the vatican's plans to disassociate itself from opus dei. he had chosen aringarosa
as the perfect pawn in his plan. after all, who more likely to leap blindly after the holy grail than

the captain approached the bed and hoisted a familiar, heavy black briefcase onto a chair. "i
believe this belongs to you."

aringarosa looked at the briefcase filled with bonds and immediately looked away, feeling only
shame. "yes... thank you." he paused while working his fingers across the seam of his bedsheet,
then continued. "captain, i have been giving this deep thought, and i need to ask a favor of you."

"of course."

"the families of those in paris who silas..." he paused, swallowing the emotion. "i realize no sum
could possibly serve as sufficient restitution, and yet, if you could be kind enough to divide the
contents of this briefcase among them... the families of the deceased."



fache's dark eyes studied him a long moment. "a virtuous gesture, my lord. i will see to it your
wishes are carried out. "

a heavy silence fell between them.

on the television, a lean french police officer was giving a press conference in front of a sprawling
