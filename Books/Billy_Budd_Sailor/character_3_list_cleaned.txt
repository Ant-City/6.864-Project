the [CHARACTER] - 
                 billy's
acquaintance and confidante aboard the bellipotent. a
wizened old sailor with beady eyes, the [CHARACTER] listens and occasionally
issues inscrutable, oracular responses when billy seeks out his
confidence. at other times, however, the [CHARACTER] is decidedly reticent
and unhelpful.
