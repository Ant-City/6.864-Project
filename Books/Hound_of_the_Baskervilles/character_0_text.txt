the hound of the baskervilles

chapter 1. mr. sherlock holmes



mr. sherlock holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings, save
upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night, was seated
at the breakfast table. i stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the
stick which our visitor had left behind him the night before. it was a
fine, thick piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as
a â€œpenang lawyer.â€ just under the head was a broad silver band nearly
an inch across. â€œto james mortimer, m.r.c.s., from his friends of the
c.c.h.,â€ was en

 not on the staff he
could only have been a house-surgeon or a house-physician--little more
than a senior student. and he left five years ago--the date is on the
stick. so your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into
thin air, my dear watson, and there emerges a young fellow under thirty,
amiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of a favourite
dog, which i should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and
smaller than a mastiff.â€

i laughed incredulously as sherlock holmes leaned back in his settee and
blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.

â€œas to the latter part, i have no means of checking you,â€ said i, â€œbut
at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars about the
manâ€™s age and professional career.â€ from my small medical shelf i took
down the medical directory and turned up the name. there were several
mortimers, but only one who could be our visitor. i read his record
aloud.

        â€œmortimer, james, m.r.c.s., 1882, gr

 fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?â€

â€œfor the very simple reason that i see the dog himself on our very
door-step, and there is the ring of its owner. donâ€™t move, i beg you,
watson. he is a professional brother of yours, and your presence may be
of assistance to me. now is the dramatic moment of fate, watson, when
you hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life, and you
know not whether for good or ill. what does dr. james mortimer, the man
of science, ask of sherlock holmes, the specialist in crime? come in!â€

the appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since i had expected
a typical country practitioner. he was a very tall, thin man, with a
long nose like a beak, which jutted out between two keen, gray eyes,
set closely together and sparkling brightly from behind a pair of
gold-rimmed glasses. he was clad in a professional but rather slovenly
fashion, for his frock-coat was dingy and his trousers frayed. though
young, his long back was already bowed, an

ions. your marriage,
you say?â€

â€œyes, sir. i married, and so left the hospital, and with it all hopes of
a consulting practice. it was necessary to make a home of my own.â€

â€œcome, come, we are not so far wrong, after all,â€ said holmes. â€œand now,
dr. james mortimer--â€

â€œmister, sir, mister--a humble m.r.c.s.â€

â€œand a man of precise mind, evidently.â€

â€œa dabbler in science, mr. holmes, a picker up of shells on the shores
of the great unknown ocean. i presume that it is mr. sherlock holmes
whom i am addressing and not--â€

â€œno, this is my friend dr. watson.â€

â€œglad to meet you, sir. i have heard your name mentioned in connection
with that of your friend. you interest me very much, mr. holmes. i
had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or such well-marked
supra-orbital development. would you have any objection to my running my
finger along your parietal fissure? a cast of your skull, sir, until
the original is available, would be an ornament to any anthropological

eum. it is not my intention to be fulsome, but i confess that i covet
your skull.â€

sherlock holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair. â€œyou are an
enthusiast in your line of thought, i perceive, sir, as i am in
mine,â€ said he. â€œi observe from your forefinger that you make your own
cigarettes. have no hesitation in lighting one.â€

the man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the other
with surprising dexterity. he had long, quivering fingers as agile and
restless as the antennae of an insect.

holmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the interest

erstood that the next of kin is mr. henry baskerville,
        if he be still alive, the son of sir charles baskervilleâ€™s
        younger brother.  the young man when last heard of was
        in america, and inquiries are being instituted with a
        view to informing him of his good fortune.â€

dr. mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket. â€œthose
are the public facts, mr. holmes, in connection with the death of sir
charles baskerville.â€

â€œi must thank you,â€ said sherlock holmes, â€œfor calling my attention to a
case which certainly presents some features of interest. i had observed
some newspaper comment at the time, but i was exceedingly preoccupied
by that little affair of the vatican cameos, and in my anxiety to oblige
the pope i lost touch with several interesting english cases. this
article, you say, contains all the public facts?â€

â€œit does.â€

â€œthen let me have the private ones.â€ he leaned back, put his finger-tips
together, and assumed his most impass

â€œnone in particular.â€

â€œgood heaven! did no one examine?â€

â€œyes, i examined, myself.â€

â€œand found nothing?â€

â€œit was all very confused. sir charles had evidently stood there for
five or ten minutes.â€

â€œhow do you know that?â€

â€œbecause the ash had twice dropped from his cigar.â€

â€œexcellent! this is a colleague, watson, after our own heart. but the
marks?â€

â€œhe had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel. i could
discern no others.â€

sherlock holmes struck his hand against his knee with an impatient
gesture.

â€œif i had only been there!â€ he cried. â€œit is evidently a case of
extraordinary interest, and one which presented immense opportunities to
the scientific expert. that gravel page upon which i might have read so
much has been long ere this smudged by the rain and defaced by the clogs
of curious peasants. oh, dr. mortimer, dr. mortimer, to think that you
should not have called me in! you have indeed much to answer for.â€

alert, dark-eyed man about thirty years of age, very sturdily built,
with thick black eyebrows and a strong, pugnacious face. he wore a
ruddy-tinted tweed suit and had the weather-beaten appearance of one who
has spent most of his time in the open air, and yet there was something
in his steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated
the gentleman.

â€œthis is sir henry baskerville,â€ said dr. mortimer.

â€œwhy, yes,â€ said he, â€œand the strange thing is, mr. sherlock holmes,
that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to you this morning
i should have come on my own account. i understand that you think out
little puzzles, and iâ€™ve had one this morning which wants more thinking
out than i am able to give it.â€

â€œpray take a seat, sir henry. do i understand you to say that you have
yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in london?â€

â€œnothing of much importance, mr. holmes. only a joke, as like as not.

â€œwhat do you make of it, dr. mortimer? you must allow that there is
nothing supernatural about this, at any rate?â€

â€œno, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was convinced
that the business is supernatural.â€

â€œwhat business?â€ asked sir henry sharply. â€œit seems to me that all you
gentlemen know a great deal more than i do about my own affairs.â€

â€œyou shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, sir henry. i
promise you that,â€ said sherlock holmes. â€œwe will confine ourselves
for the present with your permission to this very interesting document,
which must have been put together and posted yesterday evening. have you
yesterdayâ€™s times, watson?â€

â€œit is here in the corner.â€

â€œmight i trouble you for it--the inside page, please, with the leading
articles?â€ he glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes up and down the
columns. â€œcapital article this on free trade. permit me to give you an

at once and bought a pair of boots?â€

â€œi did a good deal of shopping. dr. mortimer here went round with me.
you see, if i am to be squire down there i must dress the part, and
it may be that i have got a little careless in my ways out west. among
other things i bought these brown boots--gave six dollars for them--and
had one stolen before ever i had them on my feet.â€

â€œit seems a singularly useless thing to steal,â€ said sherlock holmes.
â€œi confess that i share dr. mortimerâ€™s belief that it will not be long
before the missing boot is found.â€

â€œand, now, gentlemen,â€ said the baronet with decision, â€œit seems to me
that i have spoken quite enough about the little that i know. it is time
that you kept your promise and gave me a full account of what we are all
driving at.â€

â€œyour request is a very reasonable one,â€ holmes answered. â€œdr. mortimer,

of the times among it. the odds are enormously against your finding
it. there are ten shillings over in case of emergencies. let me have a
report by wire at baker street before evening. and now, watson, it only
remains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman, no. 2704,
and then we will drop into one of the bond street picture galleries and
fill in the time until we are due at the hotel.â€




chapter 5. three broken threads



sherlock holmes had, in a very remarkable degree, the power of detaching
his mind at will. for two hours the strange business in which we had
been involved appeared to be forgotten, and he was entirely absorbed in
the pictures of the modern belgian masters. he would talk of nothing
but art, of which he had the crudest ideas, from our leaving the gallery
until we found ourselves at the northumberland hotel.

â€œsir henry baskerville is upstairs expecting you,â€ said the clerk. â€œhe
asked me to show you up at

ll do, i will direct how you shall act. i suppose that by
saturday all might be ready?â€

â€œwould that suit dr. watson?â€

â€œperfectly.â€

â€œthen on saturday, unless you hear to the contrary, we shall meet at the
ten-thirty train from paddington.â€

we had risen to depart when baskerville gave a cry, of triumph, and
diving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown boot from
under a cabinet.

â€œmy missing boot!â€ he cried.

â€œmay all our difficulties vanish as easily!â€ said sherlock holmes.

â€œbut it is a very singular thing,â€ dr. mortimer remarked. â€œi searched
this room carefully before lunch.â€

â€œand so did i,â€ said baskerville. â€œevery inch of it.â€

â€œthere was certainly no boot in it then.â€

â€œin that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were
lunching.â€

the german was sent for but professed to know nothing of the matter,
nor could any inquiry clear it up. another item had been added to that
constant and apparently purposeless series of small

ad against me.â€

â€œi have nothing in the world against you, my good man,â€ said holmes.
â€œon the contrary, i have half a sovereign for you if you will give me a
clear answer to my questions.â€

â€œwell, iâ€™ve had a good day and no mistake,â€ said the cabman with a grin.
â€œwhat was it you wanted to ask, sir?â€

â€œfirst of all your name and address, in case i want you again.â€

â€œjohn clayton, 3 turpey street, the borough. my cab is out of shipleyâ€™s
yard, near waterloo station.â€

sherlock holmes made a note of it.

â€œnow, clayton, tell me all about the fare who came and watched this
house at ten oâ€™clock this morning and afterwards followed the two
gentlemen down regent street.â€

the man looked surprised and a little embarrassed. â€œwhy, thereâ€™s no good
my telling you things, for you seem to know as much as i do already,â€
 said he. â€œthe truth is that the gentleman told me that he was a
detective and that i was to say nothing about him to anyone.â€

â€œmy good fellow; this is
 
 ___________________________
 
 a very serious business, and you may find
yourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide anything from me.
you say that your fare told you that he was a detective?â€

â€œyes, he did.â€

â€œwhen did he say this?â€

â€œwhen he left me.â€

â€œdid he say anything more?â€

â€œhe mentioned his name.â€

holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me. â€œoh, he mentioned his name,
did he? that was imprudent. what was the name that he mentioned?â€

â€œhis name,â€ said the cabman, â€œwas mr. sherlock holmes.â€

never have i seen my friend more completely taken aback than by the
cabmanâ€™s reply. for an instant he sat in silent amazement. then he burst
into a hearty laugh.

â€œa touch, watson--an undeniable touch!â€ said he. â€œi feel a foil as quick
and supple as my own. he got home upon me very prettily that time. so
his name was sherlock holmes, was it?â€

â€œyes, sir, that was the gentlemanâ€™s name.â€

â€œexcellent! tell me where you picked him up and all that occurred.â€

â€œhe hailed me

street and along--â€

â€œi know,â€ said holmes.

â€œuntil we got three-quarters down regent street. then my gentleman threw
up the trap, and he cried that i should drive right away to waterloo
station as hard as i could go. i whipped up the mare and we were there
under the ten minutes. then he paid up his two guineas, like a good one,
and away he went into the station. only just as he was leaving he turned
round and he said: â€˜it might interest you to know that you have been
driving mr. sherlock holmes.â€™ thatâ€™s how i come to know the name.â€

â€œi see. and you saw no more of him?â€

â€œnot after he went into the station.â€

â€œand how would you describe mr. sherlock holmes?â€

the cabman scratched his head. â€œwell, he wasnâ€™t altogether such an easy
gentleman to describe. iâ€™d put him at forty years of age, and he was
of a middle height, two or three inches shorter than you, sir. he was
dressed like a toff, and he had a black beard, cut square at the end,
and a pale face. i donâ€™t

mind about it.â€

â€œabout what?â€

â€œabout sending you. itâ€™s an ugly business, watson, an ugly dangerous
business, and the more i see of it the less i like it. yes, my dear
fellow, you may laugh, but i give you my word that i shall be very glad
to have you back safe and sound in baker street once more.â€




chapter 6. baskerville hall



sir henry baskerville and dr. mortimer were ready upon the appointed
day, and we started as arranged for devonshire. mr. sherlock holmes
drove with me to the station and gave me his last parting injunctions
and advice.

â€œi will not bias your mind by suggesting theories or suspicions,
watson,â€ said he; â€œi wish you simply to report facts in the fullest
possible manner to me, and you can leave me to do the theorizing.â€

â€œwhat sort of facts?â€ i asked.

â€œanything which may seem to have a bearing however indirect upon the
case, and especially the relations between young baskerville and his
neighbours or any fresh particu

ossible that it was barrymore, after all, whom we had
seen in the cab in regent street? the beard might well have been the
same. the cabman had described a somewhat shorter man, but such an
impression might easily have been erroneous. how could i settle the
point forever? obviously the first thing to do was to see the grimpen
postmaster and find whether the test telegram had really been placed in
barrymoreâ€™s own hands. be the answer what it might, i should at least
have something to report to sherlock holmes.

sir henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast, so that the
time was propitious for my excursion. it was a pleasant walk of four
miles along the edge of the moor, leading me at last to a small gray
hamlet, in which two larger buildings, which proved to be the inn and
the house of dr. mortimer, stood high above the rest. the postmaster,
who was also the village grocer, had a clear recollection of the
telegram.

â€œcertainly, sir,â€ said he, â€œi had the telegram delivered to mr.

ffect upon his diseased heart. i fancy that he really
did see something of the kind upon that last night in the yew alley. i
feared that some disaster might occur, for i was very fond of the old
man, and i knew that his heart was weak.â€

â€œhow did you know that?â€

â€œmy friend mortimer told me.â€

â€œyou think, then, that some dog pursued sir charles, and that he died of
fright in consequence?â€

â€œhave you any better explanation?â€

â€œi have not come to any conclusion.â€

â€œhas mr. sherlock holmes?â€

the words took away my breath for an instant but a glance at the placid
face and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that no surprise was
intended.

â€œit is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you, dr. watson,â€
 said he. â€œthe records of your detective have reached us here, and you
could not celebrate him without being known yourself. when mortimer told
me your name he could not deny your identity. if you are here, then it
follows that mr. sherlock holmes is interesting him

that i have said anything which might induce sir henry to
go away. but i have done my duty now and i will say no more. i must go
back, or he will miss me and suspect that i have seen you. good-bye!â€
 she turned and had disappeared in a few minutes among the scattered
boulders, while i, with my soul full of vague fears, pursued my way to
baskerville hall.




chapter 8. first report of dr. watson



from this point onward i will follow the course of events by
transcribing my own letters to mr. sherlock holmes which lie before me
on the table. one page is missing, but otherwise they are exactly
as written and show my feelings and suspicions of the moment more
accurately than my memory, clear as it is upon these tragic events, can
possibly do.


baskerville hall, october 13th. my dear holmes: my previous letters
and telegrams have kept you pretty well up to date as to all that has
occurred in this most god-forsaken corner of the world. the longer one
stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sin
 
 ___________________________
 
ns, and that has cleared up the situation
very much. but the moor with its mysteries and its strange inhabitants
remains as inscrutable as ever. perhaps in my next i may be able to
throw some light upon this also. best of all would it be if you could
come down to us. in any case you will hear from me again in the course
of the next few days.




chapter 10. extract from the diary of dr. watson



so far i have been able to quote from the reports which i have forwarded
during these early days to sherlock holmes. now, however, i have arrived
at a point in my narrative where i am compelled to abandon this method
and to trust once more to my recollections, aided by the diary which
i kept at the time. a few extracts from the latter will carry me on to
those scenes which are indelibly fixed in every detail upon my memory. i
proceed, then, from the morning which followed our abortive chase of the
convict and our other strange experiences upon the moor.

october 16th. a dull and foggy day with a drizzle of r

confidence. tomorrow morning i shall
find my way to coombe tracey, and if i can see this mrs. laura lyons, of
equivocal reputation, a long step will have been made towards clearing
one incident in this chain of mysteries. i am certainly developing the
wisdom of the serpent, for when mortimer pressed his questions to an
inconvenient extent i asked him casually to what type franklandâ€™s skull
belonged, and so heard nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive.
i have not lived for years with sherlock holmes for nothing.

i have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous and
melancholy day. this was my conversation with barrymore just now, which
gives me one more strong card which i can play in due time.

mortimer had stayed to dinner, and he and the baronet played ecarte
afterwards. the butler brought me my coffee into the library, and i took
the chance to ask him a few questions.

â€œwell,â€ said i, â€œhas this precious relation of yours departed, or is he
still lurking out yonder?â

dering if there were any evidence of such a sound tonight.â€

â€œwe heard nothing of the kind,â€ said i.

â€œand what is your theory of this poor fellowâ€™s death?â€

â€œi have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off his head.
he has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and eventually fallen over
here and broken his neck.â€

â€œthat seems the most reasonable theory,â€ said stapleton, and he gave a
sigh which i took to indicate his relief. â€œwhat do you think about it,
mr. sherlock holmes?â€

my friend bowed his compliments. â€œyou are quick at identification,â€ said
he.

â€œwe have been expecting you in these parts since dr. watson came down.
you are in time to see a tragedy.â€

â€œyes, indeed. i have no doubt that my friendâ€™s explanation will cover
the facts. i will take an unpleasant remembrance back to london with me
tomorrow.â€

â€œoh, you return tomorrow?â€

â€œthat is my intention.â€

â€œi hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences which have

ir henry. let him think that
seldenâ€™s death was as stapleton would have us believe. he will have a
better nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo tomorrow,
when he is engaged, if i remember your report aright, to dine with these
people.â€

â€œand so am i.â€

â€œthen you must excuse yourself and he must go alone. that will be easily
arranged. and now, if we are too late for dinner, i think that we are
both ready for our suppers.â€

sir henry was more pleased than surprised to see sherlock holmes, for he
had for some days been expecting that recent events would bring him down
from london. he did raise his eyebrows, however, when he found that my
friend had neither any luggage nor any explanations for its absence.
between us we soon supplied his wants, and then over a belated supper
we explained to the baronet as much of our experience as it seemed
desirable that he should know. but first i had the unpleasant duty of
breaking the news to barrymore and his wife. to him it may have been an

acquaintance, mrs. laura lyons.â€

his plan of campaign was beginning to be evident. he would use the
baronet in order to convince the stapletons that we were really gone,
while we should actually return at the instant when we were likely to
be needed. that telegram from london, if mentioned by sir henry to the
stapletons, must remove the last suspicions from their minds. already i
seemed to see our nets drawing closer around that leanjawed pike.

mrs. laura lyons was in her office, and sherlock holmes opened his
interview with a frankness and directness which considerably amazed her.

â€œi am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of the
late sir charles baskerville,â€ said he. â€œmy friend here, dr. watson,
has informed me of what you have communicated, and also of what you have
withheld in connection with that matter.â€

â€œwhat have i withheld?â€ she asked defiantly.

â€œyou have confessed that you asked sir charles to be at the gate at ten
oâ€™clock. we know that tha

stapleton but his wife as well.â€

the lady sprang from her chair.

â€œhis wife!â€ she cried.

â€œthe fact is no longer a secret. the person who has passed for his
sister is really his wife.â€

mrs. lyons had resumed her seat. her hands were grasping the arms of her
chair, and i saw that the pink nails had turned white with the pressure
of her grip.

â€œhis wife!â€ she said again. â€œhis wife! he is not a married man.â€

sherlock holmes shrugged his shoulders.

â€œprove it to me! prove it to me! and if you can do so--!â€

the fierce flash of her eyes said more than any words.

â€œi have come prepared to do so,â€ said holmes, drawing several papers
from his pocket. â€œhere is a photograph of the couple taken in york four
years ago. it is indorsed â€˜mr. and mrs. vandeleur,â€™ but you will have no
difficulty in recognizing him, and her also, if you know her by sight.
here are three written descriptions by trustworthy witnesses

that all was for my own sake. but now
i see that i was never anything but a tool in his hands. why should i
preserve faith with him who never kept any with me? why should i try to
shield him from the consequences of his own wicked acts? ask me what you
like, and there is nothing which i shall hold back. one thing i swear
to you, and that is that when i wrote the letter i never dreamed of any
harm to the old gentleman, who had been my kindest friend.â€

â€œi entirely believe you, madam,â€ said sherlock holmes. â€œthe recital of
these events must be very painful to you, and perhaps it will make it
easier if i tell you what occurred, and you can check me if i make any
material mistake. the sending of this letter was suggested to you by
stapleton?â€

â€œhe dictated it.â€

â€œi presume that the reason he gave was that you would receive help from
sir charles for the legal expenses connected with your divorce?â€

â€œexactly.â€

â€œand then after you had sent the letter he dissuaded you from keeping

 made you swear to say nothing about your appointment with sir
charles?â€

â€œhe did. he said that the death was a very mysterious one, and that i
should certainly be suspected if the facts came out. he frightened me
into remaining silent.â€

â€œquite so. but you had your suspicions?â€

she hesitated and looked down.

â€œi knew him,â€ she said. â€œbut if he had kept faith with me i should
always have done so with him.â€

â€œi think that on the whole you have had a fortunate escape,â€ said
sherlock holmes. â€œyou have had him in your power and he knew it, and yet
you are alive. you have been walking for some months very near to the
edge of a precipice. we must wish you good-morning now, mrs. lyons, and
it is probable that you will very shortly hear from us again.â€

â€œour case becomes rounded off, and difficulty after difficulty thins
away in front of us,â€ said holmes as we stood waiting for the arrival of
the express from town. â€œi shall soon be in the position of being able
to put into a

â€œanything good?â€ he asked.

â€œthe biggest thing for years,â€ said holmes. â€œwe have two hours before
we need think of starting. i think we might employ it in getting some
dinner and then, lestrade, we will take the london fog out of your
throat by giving you a breath of the pure night air of dartmoor. never
been there? ah, well, i donâ€™t suppose you will forget your first visit.â€




chapter 14. the hound of the baskervilles



one of sherlock holmesâ€™s defects--if, indeed, one may call it a
defect--was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full plans
to any other person until the instant of their fulfilment. partly it
came no doubt from his own masterful nature, which loved to dominate and
surprise those who were around him. partly also from his professional
caution, which urged him never to take any chances. the result, however,
was very trying for those who were acting as his agents and assistants.
i had often suffered under
