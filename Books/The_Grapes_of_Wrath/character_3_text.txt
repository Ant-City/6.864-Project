you come to jesus at once 'cause of the pigtail yankin'. baptized both of you in the 
irrigation ditch at once. fightin' an' yellin' like a couple of cats." 

joad  looked  at  him  with  drooped  eyes,  and  then  he  laughed.  "why,  you're  the 
preacher. you're the preacher. i jus' passed a recollection about you to a guy not an 
hour ago." 

"i was a preacher," said the man seriously. "reverend jim casy—was a burning 
busher. used to howl out the name of jesus to glory. and used to get an irrigation 
ditch  so  squirmin'  full  of  repented  sinners  half  of  'em  like  to  drowned.  but  not  no 
more," he sighed. "jus jim casy now. ain't got the call no more. got a lot of sinful 
idears—but they seem kinda sensible." 

joad  said,  "you're  bound  to  get  idears  if  you  go  thinkin'  about  stuff.  sure  i 
remember you. you use ta give a good meetin'. i recollect one time you give a

t forty was forty. wouldn't of had the fence if uncle john didn't come drivin' in one 
night with six spools of wire in his wagon. he give 'em to pa for a shoat. we never did 
know where he got that wire." they slowed for the rise, moving their feet in the deep 
soft dust, feeling the earth with their feet. joad's eyes were inward on his memory. he 
seemed to be laughing inside himself. "uncle john was a crazy bastard," he said. "like 
what he done with that shoat." he chuckled and walked on. 

jim casy waited impatiently. the story did not continue. casy gave it a good long 
time to come out. "well, what'd he do with that shoat?" he demanded at last, with some 
irritation. 

"huh? oh! well, he killed that shoat right there, an' he got ma to light up the stove. 
he cut out pork chops an' put 'em in the pan, an' he put ribs an' a leg in the oven. he et 
chops till the ribs was done, an' he et ribs till the leg was done. an' then he tore into 
that leg. cut off big hunks of her an' shoved 'em in

his own folks used to farm. that worries me. i can see how a fella might 
come from some other place an' not know no better, but willy belongs. worried me so 
i went up to 'im and ast 'im. right off he got mad. 'i got two little kids,' he says. 'i got a 
wife an' my wife's mother. them people got to eat.' gets madder'n hell. 'fust an' on'y 
thing i got to think about is my own folks,' he says. 'what happens to other folks is 
their look-out,' he says. seems like he's 'shamed, so he gets mad." 

jim casy had been staring at the dying fire, and his eyes had grown wider and his 
neck muscles stood higher. suddenly he cried, "i got her! if ever a man got a dose of 
the sperit, i got her. got her all of a flash!" he jumped to his feet and paced back and 
forth, his head swinging. "had a tent one time. drawed as much as five hundred people 
ever' night. that's before either you fellas seen me." he stopped and faced them. "ever

 close," said joad. "seems to me i 
remember her pretty close." 

muley said, "i've covered her with bresh. nobody couldn't find her." the bottom of 

the gulch leveled off, and the footing was sand. 

joad settled himself on the clean sand. "i ain't gonna sleep in no cave," he said. "i'm 

gonna sleep right here." he rolled his coat and put it under his head. 

muley pulled at the covering brush and crawled into his cave. "i like it in here," he 

called. "i feel like nobody can come at me." 

jim casy sat down on the sand beside joad. 
"get some sleep," said joad. "we'll start for uncle john's at daybreak." 
"i ain't sleepin," said casy. "i got too much to puzzle with." he drew up his feet and 
clasped his legs. he threw back his head and looked at the sharp stars. joad yawned 
and  brought  one  hand  back  under  his  head.  they  were  silent,  and  gradually  the 
skittering  life  of  the  ground,  of  holes  and  burrows,  of  the  brush,  began  again;  the 
gophers moved, and the rab

hone with excitement. "your ma got a bad feelin' she ain't never gonna see you no 
more. she got that quiet look like when somebody died. almost she don't want to go to 
california, fear she'll never see you no more." a stove lid clashed in the house again. 
"le's surprise 'em," old tom repeated. "le's go in like you never been away. le's jus' 
see  what  your  ma  says."  at  last  he  touched  tom,  but  touched  him  on  the  shoulder, 
timidly, and instantly took his hand away. he looked at jim casy. 

tom said, "you remember the preacher, pa. he come along with me." 
"he been in prison too?" 
"no, i met 'im on the road. he been away." 
pa shook hands gravely. "you're welcome here, sir." 
casy said, "glad to be here. it's a thing to see when a boy comes home. it's a thing 

to see."

 ain't got room to set down," 
she  said.  "jus'  get  yaself  a  plate  an'  set  down  wherever  ya  can.  out  in  the  yard  or 
someplace." 

suddenly  tom  said,  "hey!  where's  the  preacher?  he  was  right  here.  where'd  he 

go?" 

pa said, "i seen him, but he's gone." 
and granma raised a shrill voice, "preacher? you got a preacher? go git him. we'll 
have a grace." she pointed at grampa. "too late for him—he's et. go git the preacher." 
tom stepped out on the porch. "hey, jim! jim casy!" he called. he walked out in 
the  yard.  "oh,  casy!"  the  preacher  emerged  from  under  the  tank,  sat  up,  and  then 
stood up and moved toward the house. tom asked, "what was you doin', hidin'?" 

"well, no. but a fella shouldn't butt his head in where a fambly got fambly stuff. i 

was jus' settin' a-thinkin'." 

"come on in an' eat," said tom. "granma wants a grace." 
"but i ain't a preacher no more," casy protested. 
"aw, come on. give her a grace. don't do you no harm, an' she lik

gimme  his  shoes  for  a  gallon.  an'  if  i  was  that  kinda  fella  i  bet  i  could  git—"  he 
glanced at ma and stopped. 

jim casy had wet his head, and the drops still coursed down his high forehead, and 
his muscled neck was wet, and his shirt was wet. he moved over beside tom. "it ain't 
the people's fault," he said. "how'd you like to sell the bed you sleep on for a tankful a 
gas?" 

"i know it ain't their fault. ever' person i talked to is on the move for a damn good 
reason. but what's the country comin' to? that's what i wanta know. what's it comin' 
to? fella can't make a livin' no more. folks can't make a livin'
