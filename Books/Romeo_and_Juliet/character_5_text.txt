come you this afternoon,
    to know our farther pleasure in this case,
    to old freetown, our common judgment place.
    once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
              exeunt [all but montague, his wife, and benvolio].

  mon. who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
    speak, nephew, were you by when it began?

  ben. here were the servants of your adversary
    and yours, close fighting ere i did approach.
    i drew to part them. in the instant came
    the fiery tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;
    which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,
    he swung about his head and cut the winds,
    who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.
    while we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
    came more and more, and fought on part and part,
    till the prince came, who parted either part.

  m. wife. o, where is romeo? saw you him to-day?
    right glad i am he was not at this fray.

    thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
    killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
    thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
    misshapen in the conduct of them both,
    like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,
    is get afire by thine own ignorance,
    and thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.
    what, rouse thee, man! thy juliet is alive,
    for whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.
    there art thou happy. tybalt would kill thee,
    but thou slewest tybalt. there art thou happy too.
    the law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friend
    and turns it to exile. there art thou happy.
    a pack of blessings light upon thy back;
    happiness courts thee in her best array;
    but, like a misbhav'd and sullen wench,
    thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.
    take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.

  cap. things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily
    that we have had no time to move our daughter.
    look you, she lov'd her kinsman tybalt dearly,
    and so did i. well, we were born to die.
    'tis very late; she'll not come down to-night.
    i promise you, but for your company,
    i would have been abed an hour ago.

  par. these times of woe afford no tune to woo.
    madam, good night. commend me to your daughter.

  lady. i will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
    to-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.

  cap. sir paris, i will make a desperate tender
    of my child's love. i think she will be rul'd

    wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
    acquaint her here of my son paris' love
    and bid her (mark you me?) on wednesday next-
    but, soft! what day is this?

  par. monday, my lord.

  cap. monday! ha, ha! well, wednesday is too soon.
    thursday let it be- a thursday, tell her
    she shall be married to this noble earl.
    will you be ready? do you like this haste?
    we'll keep no great ado- a friend or two;
    for hark you, tybalt being slain so late,
    it may be thought we held him carelessly,
    being our kinsman, if we revel much.
    therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
    and there an end. but what say you to thursday?

  par. my lord, i would that thursday were to-morrow.

  cap. well, get you gone. a thursday be it then.
    go you to juliet ere you go to bed;
    prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.

    would none but i might venge my cousin's death!

  lady. we will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.
    then weep no more. i'll send to one in mantua,
    where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
    shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram
    that he shall soon keep tybalt company;
    and then i hope thou wilt be satisfied.

  jul. indeed i never shall be satisfied
    with romeo till i behold him- dead-
    is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd.
    madam, if you could find out but a man
    to bear a poison, i would temper it;
    that romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
    soon sleep in quiet. o, how my heart abhors
    to hear him nam'd and cannot come to him,
    to wreak the love i bore my cousin tybalt

  friar. on thursday, sir? the time is very short.

  par. my father capulet will have it so,
    and i am nothing slow to slack his haste.

  friar. you say you do not know the lady's mind.
    uneven is the course; i like it not.

  par. immoderately she weeps for tybalt's death,
    and therefore have i little talk'd of love;
    for venus smiles not in a house of tears.
    now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
    that she do give her sorrow so much sway,
    and in his wisdom hastes our marriage
    to stop the inundation of her tears,
    which, too much minded by herself alone,
    may be put from her by society.
    now do you know the reason of this haste.

  friar. [aside] i would i knew not why it should be slow'd.-

time that romeo

    shall i not then be stifled in the vault,
    to whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
    and there die strangled ere my romeo comes?
    or, if i live, is it not very like
    the horrible conceit of death and night,
    together with the terror of the place-
    as in a vault, an ancient receptacle
    where for this many hundred years the bones
    of all my buried ancestors are pack'd;
    where bloody tybalt, yet but green in earth,
    lies fest'ring in his shroud; where, as they say,
    at some hours in the night spirits resort-
    alack, alack, is it not like that i,
    so early waking- what with loathsome smells,
    and shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
    that living mortals, hearing them, run mad-
    o, if i wake, shall i not be distraught,
    environed with all these hideous fears,
    and madly play with my forefathers' joints,
    and pluck the mangled tybalt f

suspected, as the time and place

    and here i stand, both to impeach and purge
    myself condemned and myself excus'd.

  prince. then say it once what thou dost know in this.

  friar. i will be brief, for my short date of breath
    is not so long as is a tedious tale.
    romeo, there dead, was husband to that juliet;
    and she, there dead, that romeo's faithful wife.
    i married them; and their stol'n marriage day
    was tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death
    banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;
    for whom, and not for tybalt, juliet pin'd.
    you, to remove that siege of grief from her,
    betroth'd and would have married her perforce
    to county paris. then comes she to me
    and with wild looks bid me devise some mean
    to rid her from this second marriage,
    or in my cell there would she kill herself.
    then gave i her (so tutored by my art)
    a sleeping potion; which so t
