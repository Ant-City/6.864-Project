[CHARACTER] - 
                 an
alpha male who fails to fit in because of his inferior physical
stature. he holds unorthodox beliefs about sexual relationships,
sports, and community events. his insecurity about his size and
status makes him discontented with the world state. bernard's surname
recalls karl marx, the nineteenth-century german author best known
for writing capital, a monumental critique of capitalist society.
unlike his famous namesake, bernard's discontent stems from his frustrated
desire to fit into his own society, rather than from a systematic
or philosophical criticism of it. when threatened, bernard can be
petty and cruel.
