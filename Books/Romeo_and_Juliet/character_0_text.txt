vants of your adversary
    and yours, close fighting ere i did approach.
    i drew to part them. in the instant came
    the fiery tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;
    which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,
    he swung about his head and cut the winds,
    who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.
    while we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
    came more and more, and fought on part and part,
    till the prince came, who parted either part.

  m. wife. o, where is romeo? saw you him to-day?
    right glad i am he was not at this fray.

  ben. madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
    peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
    a troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
    where, underneath the grove of sycamore
    that westward rooteth from the city's side,
    so early walking did i see your son.
    towards him i made; but he was ware of me
    and stole into the covert of the wood.
    i- measuring his affections by my own,
    which then

  mon. both by myself and many other friend;
    but he, his own affections' counsellor,
    is to himself- i will not say how true-
    but to himself so secret and so close,
    so far from sounding and discovery,
    as is the bud bit with an envious worm
    ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
    or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
    could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
    we would as willingly give cure as know.

                       enter romeo.


  ben. see, where he comes. so please you step aside,
    i'll know his grievance, or be much denied.

  mon. i would thou wert so happy by thy stay
    to hear true shrift. come, madam, let's away,

this love that thou hast shown
    doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
    love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;
    being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
    being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.
    what is it else? a madness most discreet,
    a choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
    farewell, my coz.

  ben. soft! i will go along.
    an if you leave me so, you do me wrong.

  rom. tut! i have lost myself; i am not here:
    this is not romeo, he's some other where.

  ben. tell me in sadness, who is that you love?

  rom. what, shall i groan and tell thee?

  ben. groan? why, no;
    but sadly tell me who.

  rom. bid a sick man in sadness make his will.
    ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!
    in sadness, cousin, i do love a woman.

  chor. now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
    and young affection gapes to be his heir;
    that fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
    with tender juliet match'd, is now not fair.
    now romeo is belov'd, and loves again,
    alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
    but to his foe suppos'd he must complain,
    and she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
    being held a foe, he may not have access
    to breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,
    and she as much in love, her means much less
    to meet her new beloved anywhere;
    but passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
    temp'ring extremities with extreme sweet.

    what i have spoke; but farewell compliment!

    thou mayst prove false. at lovers' perjuries,
    they say jove laughs. o gentle romeo,
    if thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
    or if thou thinkest i am too quickly won,
    i'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
    so thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
    in truth, fair montague, i am too fond,
    and therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;

  rom. father, what news? what is the prince's doom
    what sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand
    that i yet know not?

  friar. too familiar
    is my dear son with such sour company.
    i bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.

  rom. what less than doomsday is the prince's doom?

  friar. a gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips-
    not body's death, but body's banishment.

  rom. ha, banishment? be merciful, say 'death';
    for exile hath more terror in his lo

 smilest upon the stroke that murders me.

  friar. o deadly sin! o rude unthankfulness!
    thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
    taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
    and turn'd that black word death to banishment.
    this is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.

  rom. 'tis torture, and not mercy. heaven is here,
    where juliet lives; and every cat and dog
    and little mouse, every unworthy thing,
    live here in heaven and may look on her;
    but romeo may not. more validity,
    more honourable state, more courtship lives
    in carrion flies than romeo. they may seize
    on the white wonder of dear juliet's hand
    and steal immortal blessing from her lips,
    who, even in pure and vestal modesty,
    still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
    but romeo may not- he is banished.
    this may flies do, when i from this must fly;
    they are free men, but i am banished.
    and sayest thou yet that exile is not death?

    and fall upon the ground, as i do now,
    taking the measure of an unmade grave.

    if i did stay to look on his intents.

  friar. stay then; i'll go alone. fear comes upon me.
    o, much i fear some ill unthrifty thing.

    alack, alack, what blood is this which stains
    the stony entrance of this sepulchre?
    what mean these masterless and gory swords

    romeo! o, pale! who else? what, paris too?
    and steep'd in blood? ah, what an unkind hour
    is guilty of this lamentable chance! the lady stirs.

    poison, i see, hath been his timeless end.
    o churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
    to help me after? i will kiss thy lips.

  friar. i am the greatest, able to do least,
    yet most suspected, as the time and place
    doth make against me, of this direful murther;
    and here i stand, both to impeach and purge
    myself condemned and myself excus'd.

  prince. then say it once what thou dost know in this.

  friar. i will be brief, for my short date of breath
    is not so long as is a tedious tale.
    romeo, there dead, was husband to that juliet;
    and she, there dead, that romeo's faithful wife.
    i married them; and their stol'n marriage day
    was tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death
    banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;
    for whom, and not for tybalt, juliet pin'd.
    you, to remove that siege of grief from her,
    betroth'd and would have married her perforce
    to county paris. then comes she to me
    and with wild looks bid me devise some mean

rid her from this second marriage,
    or in my cell there would she kill herself.
    then gave i her (so tutored by my art)
    a sleeping potion; which so took effect
    as i intended, for it wrought on her
    the form of death. meantime i writ to romeo
    that he should hither come as this dire night
    to help to take her from her borrowed grave,
    being the time the potion's force should cease.
    but he which bore my letter, friar john,
    was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
    return'd my letter back. then all alone
    at the prefixed hour of her waking
    came i to take her from her kindred's vault;
    meaning to keep her closely at my cell
    till i conveniently could send to romeo.
    but when i came, some mi

nute ere the time
    of her awaking, here untimely lay
    the noble paris and true romeo dead.
    she wakes; and i entreated her come forth
    and bear this work of heaven with patience;
    but then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
    and she, too desperate, would not go with me,
    but, as it seems, did violence on herself.
    all this i know, and to the marriage
    her nurse is privy; and if aught in this
    miscarried by my fault, let my old life
    be sacrific'd, some hour before his time,
    unto the rigour of severest law.

    and then in post he came from mantua
    to this same place, to this same monument.
    this letter he early bid me give his father,
    and threat'ned me with death, going in the vault,
