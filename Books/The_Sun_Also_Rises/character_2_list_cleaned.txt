[CHARACTER] - 
                 a
wealthy american writer living in paris. though he is an expatriate
like many of his acquaintances, cohn stands apart because he had
no direct experience of world war i and because he is jewish. he
holds on to the romantic prewar ideals of love and fair play, yet, against
the backdrop of the devastating legacy of world war i, these values
seem tragically absurd. as a jew and a nonveteran, cohn is a convenient
target for the cruel and petty antagonism of jake and his friends.
