  rom. tush, thou art deceiv'd.
    leave me and do the thing i bid thee do.
    hast thou no letters to me from the friar?

  man. no, my good lord.

  rom. no matter. get thee gone
    and hire those horses. i'll be with thee straight.
                                               exit [balthasar].
    well, juliet, i will lie with thee to-night.
    let's see for means. o mischief, thou art swift
    to enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
    i do remember an apothecary,
    and hereabouts 'a dwells, which late i noted
    in tatt'red weeds, with overwhelming brows,
    culling of simples. meagre were his looks,
    sharp misery had worn him to the bones;
    and in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
    an alligator stuff'd, and other skins
    of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
    a beggarly account of empty boxes,
    green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
    remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses
    were thinly scattered

, to make up a show.
    noting this penury, to myself i said,
    'an if a man did need a poison now
    whose sale is present death in mantua,
    here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
    o, this same thought did but forerun my need,
    and this same needy man must sell it me.
    as i remember, this should be the house.
    being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. what, ho! apothecary!

                        enter apothecary.


  apoth. who calls so loud?

  rom. come hither, man. i see that thou art poor.
    hold, there is forty ducats. let me have
    a dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
    as will disperse itself through all the veins
    that the life-weary taker mall fall dead,
    and that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath
    as violently as hasty powder fir'd
    doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.

  apoth. such mortal drugs i have; but mantua's law
    is death to any he tha

 chambermaids. o, here
    will i set up my everlasting rest
    and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
    from this world-wearied flesh. eyes, look your last!
    arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, o you
    the doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
    a dateless bargain to engrossing death!
    come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!
    thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
    the dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!
    here's to my love! [drinks.] o true apothecary!
    thy drugs are quick. thus with a kiss i die.          falls.

  friar. bliss be upon you! tell me, good my friend,
    what torch is yond that vainly lends his light
    to grubs and eyeless skulls? as i discern,
    it burneth in the capels' monument
