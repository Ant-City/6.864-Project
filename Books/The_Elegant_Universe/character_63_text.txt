d to the earth through the

sudden change in the gravitational force governing its motion.

this  conclusion  is  in  direct  conflict  with  special  relativity,  since  the  latter  ensures  that  no
information can be transmitted faster than the speed of lightâ€”instantaneous transmission violates this
precept maximally.

in  the  early  part  of  the  twentieth  century,  therefore,  einstein  realized  that  the  tremendously
successful newtonian theory of gravity was in conflict with his special theory of relativity. confident
in  the  veracity  of  special  relativity  and  notwithstanding  the  mountain  of  experimental  support  for
newton's  theory,  einstein  sought  a  new  theory  of  gravity  compatible  with  special  relativity.  this
ultimately led him to the discovery of general relativity, in which the character of space and time
again went through a remarkable transformation.

einstein's happiest thought

even  before  the  discovery  of  special  relativity,  newton's  theory  of  gravity
