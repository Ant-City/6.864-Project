Dr. Branom - 
                Played
by Madge Ryan
                Dr. Brodsky's assistant and
the doctor in charge of instructing Alex during his treatment. Like
Dr. Brodsky, Dr. Branom tries to maintain a cool scientific detachment.
However, her zealousness for reforming the prisoner shows through during
some of her speeches about the need to cure him.
