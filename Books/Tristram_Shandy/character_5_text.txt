but mark me the polygon, with its exact lines and angles--that i could
do very well, quoth my uncle.--i would begin with the fosse, and if your
honour could tell me the proper depth and breadth--i can to a hair's
breadth, trim, replied my uncle.--i would throw out the earth upon
this hand towards the town for the scarp,--and on that hand towards
the campaign for the counterscarp.--very right, trim, quoth my uncle
toby:--and when i had sloped them to your mind,--an' please your honour,
i would face the glacis, as the finest fortifications are done in
flanders, with sods,--and as your honour knows they should be,--and i
would make the walls and parapets with sods too.--the best engineers
call them gazons, trim, said my uncle toby.--whether they are gazons or
sods, is not much matter, replied trim; your honour knows they are ten
times beyond a facing either of brick or stone.--i know they are,
trim in some respects,--quoth my uncle

pray, what's all that racket over our heads, obadiah?--quoth my
father;--my brother and i can scarce hear ourselves speak.

sir, answered obadiah, making a bow towards his left shoulder,--my
mistress is taken very badly.--and where's susannah running down the
garden there, as if they were going to ravish her?--sir, she is running
the shortest cut into the town, replied obadiah, to fetch the old
midwife.--then saddle a horse, quoth my father, and do you go directly
for dr. slop, the man-midwife, with all our services,--and let him know
your mistress is fallen into labour--and that i desire he will return
with you with all speed.

it is very strange, says my father, addressing himself to my uncle toby,
as obadiah shut the door,--as there is so expert an operator as dr. slop
so near,--that my wife should persist to the very last in this obstinate
humour of hers, in trusting the life of my child, who has had one
misfortune already, to the ignorance of an old woman;--and

afely delivered of it:--and, at
this hour, it is a thing full as problematical as the subject of the
dissertation itself,--(considering the confusion and distresses of our
domestick misadventures, which are now coming thick one upon the back
of another) whether i shall be able to find a place for it in the third
volume or not.



chapter 1.xxxiii.

it is about an hour and a half's tolerable good reading since my uncle
toby rung the bell, when obadiah was ordered to saddle a horse, and go
for dr. slop, the man-midwife;--so that no one can say, with reason,
that i have not allowed obadiah time enough, poetically speaking, and
considering the emergency too, both to go and come;--though, morally and
truly speaking, the man perhaps has scarce had time to get on his boots.

if the hypercritick will go upon this; and is resolved after all to take
a pendulum, and measure the true distance betwixt the ringing of the
bell, and the rap at the door;--and, after finding it to be no more than
two minutes

ould take upon him
to insult over me for such a breach in the unity, or rather probability
of time;--i would remind him, that the idea of duration, and of its
simple modes, is got merely from the train and succession of our
ideas--and is the true scholastic pendulum,--and by which, as a scholar,
i will be tried in this matter,--abjuring and detesting the jurisdiction
of all other pendulums whatever.

i would therefore desire him to consider that it is but poor eight miles
from shandy-hall to dr. slop, the man-midwife's house:--and that whilst
obadiah has been going those said miles and back, i have brought my
uncle toby from namur, quite across all flanders, into england:--that
i have had him ill upon my hands near four years;--and have since
travelled him and corporal trim in a chariot-and-four, a journey of near
two hundred miles down into yorkshire.--all which put together, must
have prepared the reader's imagination for the entrance of dr. slop upon
the stage,--as much, at least (i hope

seconds,--when i have said all i can about them; and that this plea,
though it might save me dramatically, will damn me biographically,
rendering my book from this very moment, a professed romance, which,
before, was a book apocryphal:--if i am thus pressed--i then put an
end to the whole objection and controversy about it all at once,--by
acquainting him, that obadiah had not got above threescore yards from
the stable-yard, before he met with dr. slop;--and indeed he gave a
dirty proof that he had met with him, and was within an ace of giving a
tragical one too.

imagine to yourself;--but this had better begin a new chapter.



chapter 1.xxxiv.

imagine to yourself a little squat, uncourtly figure of a doctor slop,
of about four feet and a half perpendicular height, with a breadth of
back, and a sesquipedality of belly, which might have done honour to a
serjeant in the horse-guards.

such were the out-lines of dr. slop's figure, which--if yo

read hogarth's analysis of beauty, and if you have not, i wish you
would;--you must know, may as certainly be caricatured, and conveyed to
the mind by three strokes as three hundred.

imagine such a one,--for such, i say, were the outlines of dr. slop's
figure, coming slowly along, foot by foot, waddling thro' the dirt upon
the vertebrae of a little diminutive pony, of a pretty colour--but of
strength,--alack!--scarce able to have made an amble of it, under such
a fardel, had the roads been in an ambling condition.--they were
not.--imagine to yourself, obadiah mounted upon a strong monster of
a coach-horse, pricked into a full gallop, and making all practicable
speed the adverse way.

pray, sir, let me interest you a moment in this descripti

on.

had dr. slop beheld obadiah a mile off, posting in a narrow lane
directly towards him, at that monstrous rate,--splashing and plunging
like a devil thro' thick and thin, as he approached, would not such a
phaenomenon, with such a vortex of mud and water moving along with it,
round its axis,--have been a subject of juster apprehension to dr. slop
in his situation, than the worst of whiston's comets?--to say nothing of
the nucleus; that is, of obadiah and the coach-horse.--in my idea, the
vortex alone of 'em was enough to have involved and carried, if not the
doctor, at least the doctor's pony, quite away with it. what then do you
think must the terror and hydrophobia of dr. slop have been, when you
read (which you are just going to do) that he was advancing thus warily
along towards shandy-hall, and had approached to within sixty yards

of
it, and within five yards of a sudden turn, made by an acute angle
of the garden-wall,--and in the dirtiest part of a dirty
lane,--when obadiah and his coach-horse turned the corner, rapid,
furious,--pop,--full upon him!--nothing, i think, in nature, can be
supposed more terrible than such a rencounter,--so imprompt! so ill
prepared to stand the shock of it as dr. slop was.

what could dr. slop do?--he crossed himself + --pugh!--but the doctor,
sir, was a papist.--no matter; he had better have kept hold of the
pummel.--he had so;--nay, as it happened, he had better have done
nothing at all; for in crossing himself he let go his whip,--and in
attempting to save his whip betwixt his knee and his saddle's skirt, as
it slipped, he lost his stirrup,--in losing which he lost his seat;--and
in the multitude of all these losses (which, by the bye, shews what
little advantage there is in cross

ing) the unfortunate doctor lost his
presence of mind. so that without waiting for obadiah's onset, he left
his pony to its destiny, tumbling off it diagonally, something in the
stile and manner of a pack of wool, and without any other consequence
from the fall, save that of being left (as it would have been) with the
broadest part of him sunk about twelve inches deep in the mire.

obadiah pull'd off his cap twice to dr. slop;--once as he was
falling,--and then again when he saw him seated.--ill-timed
complaisance;--had not the fellow better have stopped his horse, and
got off and help'd him?--sir, he did all that his situation would
allow;--but the momentum of the coach-horse was so great, that obadiah
could not do it all at once; he rode in a circle three times round dr.
slop, before he could fully accomplish it any how;--and at the last,
when he did stop his beast, 'twas done with such an explosion of mud,

badiah had better have been a league off. in short, never was a
dr. slop so beluted, and so transubstantiated, since that affair came
into fashion.



chapter 1.xxxv.

when dr. slop entered the back parlour, where my father and my uncle
toby were discoursing upon the nature of women,--it was hard to
determine whether dr. slop's figure, or dr. slop's presence, occasioned
more surprize to them; for as the accident happened so near the house,
as not to make it worth while for obadiah to remount him,--obadiah had
led him in as he was, unwiped, unappointed, unannealed, with all his
stains and blotches on him.--he stood like hamlet's ghost, motionless
and speechless, for a full minute and a half at the parlour-door
(obadiah still holding his hand) with all the majesty of mud. his hinder
parts, upon which he had received his fall, totally besme

ared,--and in
every other part of him, blotched over in such a manner with obadiah's
explosion, that you would have sworn (without mental reservation) that
every grain of it had taken effect.

here was a fair opportunity for my uncle toby to have triumphed over
my father in his turn;--for no mortal, who had beheld dr. slop in that
pickle, could have dissented from so much, at least, of my uncle toby's
opinion, 'that mayhap his sister might not care to let such a dr. slop
come so near her....' but it was the argumentum ad hominem; and if my
uncle toby was not very expert at it, you may think, he might not care
to use it.--no; the reason was,--'twas not his nature to insult.

dr. slop's presence at that time, was no less problematical than the
mode of it; tho' it is certain, one moment's reflexion in my father
might have solved it; for he had apprized dr. slop but the week before,
that my mother was at her full reckoning; and as the doctor had heard
nothing since

o talk all;--so no author, who
understands the just boundaries of decorum and good-breeding, would
presume to think all: the truest respect which you can pay to the
reader's understanding, is to halve this matter amicably, and leave him
something to imagine, in his turn, as well as yourself.

for my own part, i am eternally paying him compliments of this kind, and
do all that lies in my power to keep his imagination as busy as my own.

'tis his turn now;--i have given an ample description of dr. slop's
sad overthrow, and of his sad appearance in the back-parlour;--his
imagination must now go on with it for a while.

let the reader imagine then, that dr. slop has told his tale--and in
what words, and with what aggravations, his fancy chooses;--let him
suppose, that obadiah has told his tale also, and with such rueful looks
of affected concern, as he thinks best will contrast the two figures as
they stand by each other.--let him imagine, that my father has
stepped up stairs to see my mother.-

-and, to conclude this work of
imagination,--let him imagine the doctor washed,--rubbed down, and
condoled,--felicitated,--got into a pair of obadiah's pumps, stepping
forwards towards the door, upon the very point of entering upon action.

truce!--truce, good dr. slop!--stay thy obstetrick hand;--return it
safe into thy bosom to keep it warm;--little dost thou know what
obstacles,--little dost thou think what hidden causes, retard its
operation!--hast thou, dr. slop,--hast thou been entrusted with the
secret articles of the solemn treaty which has brought thee into this
place?--art thou aware that at this instant, a daughter of lucina is put
obstetrically over thy head? alas!--'tis too true.--besides, great son
of pilumnus! what canst thou do?--thou hast come forth unarm'd;--thou
hast left thy tire-tete,--thy new-invented forceps,--thy crotchet,--thy
squirt, and all thy instruments of salvation and deliverance, behind
thee,--by heaven! at this moment they

crown! and quoth my uncle toby, i'll give him another.

your sudden and unexpected arrival, quoth my uncle toby, addressing
himself to dr. slop, (all three of them sitting down to the fire
together, as my uncle toby began to speak)--instantly brought the great
stevinus into my head, who, you must know, is a favourite author with
me.--then, added my father, making use of the argument ad crumenam,--i
will lay twenty guineas to a single crown-piece (which will serve to
give away to obadiah when he gets back) that this same stevinus was some
engineer or other--or has wrote something or other, either directly or
indirectly, upon the science

 of fortification.

he has so,--replied my uncle toby.--i knew it, said my father, though,
for the soul of me, i cannot see what kind of connection there can
be betwixt dr. slop's sudden coming, and a discourse upon
fortification;--yet i fear'd it.--talk of what we will, brother,--or let
the occasion be never so foreign or unfit for the subject,--you are
sure to bring it in. i would not, brother toby, continued my
father,--i declare i would not have my head so full of curtins and
horn-works.--that i dare say you would not, quoth dr. slop, interrupting
him, and laughing most immoderately at his pun.

dennis the critic could not detest and abhor a pun, or the insinuation
 
 ___________________________
 

of a pun, more cordially than my father;--he would grow testy upon it at
any time;--but to be broke in upon by one, in a serious discourse, was
as bad, he would say, as a fillip upon the nose;--he saw no difference.

sir, quoth my uncle toby, addressing himself to dr. slop,--the
curtins my brother shandy mentions here, have nothing to do with
beadsteads;--tho', i know du cange says, 'that bed-curtains, in all
probability, have taken their name from them;'--nor have the horn-works
he speaks of, any thing in the world to do with the horn-works of
cuckoldom: but the curtin, sir, is the word we use in fortification, for
that part of the wall or rampart which lies between the two bastions and
joins them--besiegers seldom offer to carry on their attacks directly

('tis the case of other curtains, quoth dr. slop, laughing.) however,
continued my uncle toby, to make them sure, we generally choose to place
ravelins before them, taking care only to extend them beyond the fosse
or ditch:--the common men, who know very little of fortification,
confound the ravelin and the half-moon together,--tho' they are very
different things;--not in their figure or construction, for we make
them exactly alike, in all points; for they always consist of two faces,
making a salient angle, with the gorges, not straight, but

affair
which arose about stevinus.

i need not tell the reader, if he keeps a hobby-horse,--that a man's
hobby-horse is as tender a part as he has about him; and that
these unprovoked strokes at my uncle toby's could not be unfelt by
him.--no:--as i said above, my uncle toby did feel them, and very
sensibly too.

pray, sir, what said he?--how did he behave?--o, sir!--it was great: for
as soon as my father had done insulting his hobby-horse,--he turned his
head without the least emotion, from dr. slop, to whom he was addressing
his discourse, and looking up into my father's face, with a countenance
spread over with so much good-nature;--so placid;--so fraternal;--so
inexpressibly tender towards him:--it penetrated my father to his heart:
he rose up hastily from his chair, and seizing hold of both my
uncle toby's hands as he spoke:--brother toby, said he:--i beg thy
pardon;--forgive, i pray thee, this rash humour which my mother gave
me.--my dear, dear brother, answered my uncle toby, rising

lcome, brother, quoth my uncle
toby,--had it been fifty times as much.--besides, what have i to do,
my dear toby, cried my father, either with your amusements or your
pleasures, unless it was in my power (which it is not) to increase their
measure?

--brother shandy, answered my uncle toby, looking wistfully in his
face,--you are much mistaken in this point:--for you do increase my
pleasure very much, in begetting children for the shandy family at your
time of life.--but, by that, sir, quoth dr. slop, mr. shandy increases
his own.--not a jot, quoth my father.



chapter 1.xxxviii.

my brother does it, quoth my uncle toby, out of principle.--in a family
way, i suppose, quoth dr. slop.--pshaw!--said my father,--'tis not worth
talking of.



chapter 1.xxxix.

at the end of the last chapter, my father and my uncle toby were left
both standing, like brutus and cassius, at the close of the scene,
making up their accounts.

as my father spoke the three last words,--he sat down;--my uncle toby
exac

tly followed his example, only, that before he took his chair, he
rung the bell, to order corporal trim, who was in waiting, to step
home for stevinus:--my uncle toby's house being no farther off than the
opposite side of the way.

some men would have dropped the subject of stevinus;--but my uncle toby
had no resentment in his heart, and he went on with the subject, to shew
my father that he had none.

your sudden appearance, dr. slop, quoth my uncle, resuming the
discourse, instantly brought stevinus into my head. (my father, you
may be sure, did not offer to lay any more wagers upon stevinus's
head.)--because, continued my uncle toby, the celebrated sailing
chariot, which belonged to prince maurice, and was of such wonderful
contrivance and velocity, as to carry half a dozen people thirty german
miles, in i don't know how few minutes,--was invented by stevinus, that
great mathematician and engineer.

you might have spared

your servant the trouble, quoth dr. slop (as the
fellow is lame) of going for stevinus's account of it, because in my
return from leyden thro' the hague, i walked as far as schevling, which
is two long miles, on purpose to take a view of it.

that's nothing, replied my uncle toby, to what the learned peireskius
did, who walked a matter of five hundred miles, reckoning from paris to
schevling, and from schevling to paris back again, in order to see it,
and nothing else.

some men cannot bear to be out-gone.

the more fool peireskius, r

eplied dr. slop. but mark, 'twas out of no
contempt of peireskius at all;--but that peireskius's indefatigable
labour in trudging so far on foot, out of love for the sciences, reduced
the exploit of dr. slop, in that affair, to nothing:--the more fool
peireskius, said he again.--why so?--replied my father, taking his
brother's part, not only to make reparation as fast as he could for the
insult he had given him, which sat still upon my father's mind;--but
partly, that my father began really to interest himself in the
discourse.--why so?--said he. why is peireskius, or any man else, to be
abused for an appetite for that, or any other morsel of sound knowledge:
for notwithstanding i know nothing of t

i cannot guess upon what principles of philosophy he has atchieved
it;--yet certainly his machine has been constructed upon solid ones,
be they what they will, or it could not have answered at the rate my
brother mentions.

it answered, replied my uncle toby, as well, if not better; for, as
peireskius elegantly expresses it, speaking of the velocity of its
motion, tam citus erat, quam erat ventus; which, unless i have forgot my
latin, is, that it was as swift as the wind itself.

but pray, dr. slop, quoth my father, interrupting my uncle (tho' not
without begging pardon for it at the same time) upon what principles was
this self-same chariot set a-going?--upon very pretty principles to
be sure, replied dr. slop:--and i have often wondered, continued he,
evading the question, why none of our gentry, who live upon large
plains like this of ours,--(especially they whose wives are not past
child-bearing) attempt nothing of this kind; for it would not only
be infinitely expeditious upon sudden

e toby, for such a
thing as a sermon to have got into my stevinus.

i think 'tis a sermon, replied trim:--but if it please your honours,
as it is a fair hand, i will read you a page;--for trim, you must know,
loved to hear himself read almost as well as talk.

i have ever a strong propensity, said my father, to look into things
which cross my way, by such strange fatalities as these;--and as we
have nothing better to do, at least till obadiah gets back, i shall be
obliged to you, brother, if dr. slop has no objection to it, to order
the corporal to give us a page or two of it,--if he is as able to do it,
as he seems willing. an' please your honour, quoth trim, i officiated
two whole campaigns, in flanders, as clerk to the chaplain of the
regiment.--he can read it, quoth my uncle toby, as well as i can.--trim,
i assure you, was the best scholar in my company, and should have had
the next halberd, but for the poor fellow's misfortune. corporal trim
laid his hand upon his heart, and made an hu

mble bow to his master; then
laying down his hat upon the floor, and taking up the sermon in his
left hand, in order to have his right at liberty,--he advanced, nothing
doubting, into the middle of the room, where he could best see, and be
best seen by his audience.



chapter 1.xli.

--if you have any objection,--said my father, addressing himself to dr.
slop. not in the least, replied dr. slop;--for it does not appear on
which side of the question it is wrote,--it may be a composition of
a divine of our church, as well as yours,--so that we run equal
risques.--'tis wrote upon neither side, quoth trim, for 'tis only upon
conscience, an' please your honours.

trim's reason put his audience into good humour,--all but dr. slop, who
turning his head about towards trim, looked a little angry.

begin, trim,--and read distinctly, quoth my father.--i will, an'
please your honour, replied the 
 
 ___________________________
 
the laws of gravity ordered
it,--but with the palm of it open and turned towards his audience, ready
to aid the sentiment in case it stood in need.

corporal trim's eyes and the muscles of his face were in full harmony
with the other parts of him;--he looked frank,--unconstrained,--
something assured,--but not bordering upon assurance.

let not the critic ask how corporal trim could come by all this.--i've
told him it should be explained;--but so he stood before my father, my
uncle toby, and dr. slop,--so swayed his body, so contrasted his limbs,
and with such an oratorical sweep throughout the whole figure,--a
statuary might have modelled from it;--nay, i doubt whether the oldest
fellow of a college,--or the hebrew professor himself, could have much
mended it.

trim made a bow, and read as follows:

--for we trust we have a good conscience.

'trust!--trust we have a good conscience!'

(certainly, trim, quoth my father, interrupting him, you give that

e a very improper accent; for you curl up your nose, man, and
read it with such a sneering tone, as if the parson was going to abuse
the apostle.

he is, an' please your honour, replied trim. pugh! said my father,
smiling.

sir, quoth dr. slop, trim is certainly in the right; for the writer (who
i perceive is a protestant) by the snappish manner in which he takes up
the apostle, is certainly going to abuse him;--if this treatment of him
has not done it already. but from whence, replied my father, have you
concluded so soon, dr. slop, that the writer is of our church?--for
aught i can see yet,--he may be of any church.--because, answered dr.
slop, if he was of ours,--he durst no more take such a licence,--than
a bear by his beard:--if

, in our communion, sir, a man was to insult an
apostle,--a saint,--or even the paring of a saint's nail,--he would have
his eyes scratched out.--what, by the saint? quoth my uncle toby. no,
replied dr. slop, he would have an old house over his head. pray is
the inquisition an ancient building, answered my uncle toby, or is it
a modern one?--i know nothing of architecture, replied dr. slop.--an'
please your honours, quoth trim, the inquisition is the vilest--prithee
spare thy description, trim, i hate the very name of it, said my
father.--no matter for that, answered dr. slop,--it has its uses; for
tho' i'm no great advocate for it, yet, in such a case as this, he would
soon be taught better manners; and i can tell him, if he went on at that
rate, would be flung into the inquisition for his pains. god help him

the sermon.

hebrews xiii. 18.

--for we trust we have a good conscience.--

'trust! trust we have a good conscience! surely if there is any thing in
this life which a man may depend upon, and to the knowledge of which he
is capable of arriving upon the most indisputable evidence, it must be
this very thing,--whether he has a good conscience or no.'

(i am positive i am right, quoth dr. slop.)

'if a man thinks at all, he cannot well be a stranger to the true state
of this account:--he must be privy to his own thoughts and desires;--he
must remember his past pursuits, and know certainly the true springs and
motives, which, in general, have governed the actions of his life.'

(i defy him, without an assistant, quoth dr. slop.)

'in other matters we may be deceived by false appearances; and, as the
wise man complains, hardly do we guess aright at the things that are
upon the earth, a

will say, from the very terms of the
proposition,--whenever this inward testimony goes against a man, and he
stands self-accused, that he must necessarily be a guilty man.--and, on
the contrary, when the report is favourable on his side, and his heart
condemns him not:--that it is not a matter of trust, as the apostle
intimates, but a matter of certainty and fact, that the conscience is
good, and that the man must be good also.'

(then the apostle is altogether in the wrong, i suppose, quoth dr. slop,
and the protestant divine is in the right. sir, have patience, replied
my father, for i think it will presently appear that st. paul and the
protestant divine are both of an opinion.--as nearly so, quoth dr. slop,
as east is to west;--but this, continued he, lifting both hands, comes
from the liberty of the press.

it is no more at the worst, replied my uncle toby, than the liberty of
the pulpit; for it does not appear that the sermon is printed, or ever
likely to be.

'perhaps he was gone out in company with honour to fight a duel: to
pay off some debt at play;--or dirty annuity, the bargain of his lust;
perhaps conscience all this time was engaged at home, talking aloud
against petty larceny, and executing vengeance upon some such puny
crimes as his fortune and rank of life secured him against all
temptation of committing; so that he lives as merrily;'--(if he was of
our church, tho', quoth dr. slop, he could not)--'sleeps as soundly in
his bed;--and at last meets death unconcernedly;--perhaps much more so,
than a much better man.'

(all this is impossible with us, quoth dr. slop, turning to my
father,--the case could not happen in our church.--it happens in ours,
however, replied my father, but too often.--i own, quoth dr. slop,
(struck a little with my father's frank acknowledgment)--that a man
in the romish church may live as badly;--but then he cannot easily
die so.--'tis little matter

indifference,--how a rascal dies.--i mean, answered dr. slop, he would
be denied the benefits of the last sacraments.--pray how many have you

dr. slop.--humph!--said my uncle toby; tho' not accented as a note of
acquiescence,--but as an interjection of that particular species of
surprize, when a man in looking into a drawer, finds more of a thing

ear, understood my uncle toby as well as if he had wrote a whole volume

(here corporal trim and my uncle toby exchanged looks with each
other.--aye, aye, trim! quoth my uncle toby, shaking his head,--these
are but sorry fortifications, trim.--o! very poor work, answered trim,
to what your honour and i make of it.--the character of this last man,
said dr. slop, interrupting trim, is more detestable than all the rest;
and seems to have been taken from some pettifogging lawyer amongst
you:--amongst us, a man's conscience could not possibly continue so long
blinded,--three times in a year, at least, he must go to confession.
will that restore it to sight? quoth my uncle toby,--go on, trim, quoth
my father, or obadiah will have got back before thou has got to the
end of thy sermon.--'tis a very short one, replied trim.--i wish it was
longer, quoth my unc

subject to your king, or a good servant to your god,--call in religion
and morality.--look, what is written in the law of god?--how readest
thou?--consult calm reason and the unchangeable obligations of justice
and truth;--what say they?

'let conscience determine the matter upon these reports;--and then
if thy heart condemns thee not, which is the case the apostle
supposes,--the rule will be infallible;'--(here dr. slop fell
asleep)--'thou wilt have confidence towards god;--that is, have just
grounds to believe the judgment thou hast past upon thyself, is the
judgment of god; and nothing else but an anticipation of that righteous
sentence which will be pronounced upon thee hereafter by that being, to
whom thou art finally to give an account of thy actions.

ecclesiasticus expresses it, who is not pricked with the multitude of

the many provisions made,--that in all such corrupt and misguided
cases, where principles and the checks of conscience will not make
us upright,--to supply their force, and, by the terrors of gaols and
halters, oblige us to it.'

(i see plainly, said my father, that this sermon has been composed to be
preached at the temple,--or at some assize.--i like the reasoning,--and
am sorry that dr. slop has fallen asleep before the time of his
conviction:--for it is now clear, that the parson, as i thought at
first, never insulted st. paul in the least;--nor has there been,
brother, the least difference between them.--a great matter, if they
had differed, replied my uncle toby,--the best friends in the world may
differ sometimes.--true,--brother toby quoth my father, shaking hands
with him,--we'll fill our pipes, brother, and then trim shall go on.

'let him declaim as pompously as he chooses upon the subject, it will
be found to rest upon no better foundation than either his interest, his
pride, his ease, or some such little and changeable passion as will give
us but small dependence upon his actions in matters of great distress.

'i will illustrate this by an example.

'i know the banker i deal with, or the physician i usually call
in,'--(there is no need, cried dr. slop, (waking) to call in any
physician in this case)--'to be neither of them men of much religion: i
hear them make a jest of it every day, and treat all its sanctions with
so much scorn, as to put the matter past doubt. well;--notwithstanding
this, i put my fortune into the hands of the one:--and what is dearer
still to me, i trust my life to the honest skill of the other.

'now let me examine what is my reason for this great confidence. why, in

man, through force of this delusion, generally looks down with spiritual
pride upon every other man who has less affectation of piety,--though,
perhaps, ten times more real honesty than himself.

'this likewise is a sore evil under the sun; and i believe, there is no
one mistaken principle, which, for its time, has wrought more serious
mischiefs.--for a general proof of this,--examine the history of the
romish church;'--(well what can you make of that? cried dr. slop)--'see
what scenes of cruelty, murder, rapine, bloodshed,'--(they may thank
their own obstinacy, cried dr. slop)--have all been sanctified by a
religion not strictly governed by morality.

'in how many kingdoms of the world'--(here trim kept waving his
right-hand from the sermon to the extent of his arm, returning it
backwards and forwards to the conclusion of the paragraph.)

'in how many kingdoms of the world has the crusading sword of this

trim, his colour returning into his face as red as blood.)--'behold this
helpless victim delivered up to his tormentors,--his body so wasted with
sorrow and confinement.'--(oh! 'tis my brother, cried poor trim in a
most passionate exclamation, dropping the sermon upon the ground, and
clapping his hands together--i fear 'tis poor tom. my father's and my
uncle toby's heart yearned with sympathy for the poor fellow's distress;
even slop himself acknowledged pity for him.--why, trim, said my father,
this is not a history,--'tis a sermon thou art reading; prithee begin
the sentence again.)--'behold this helpless victim delivered up to his
tormentors,--his body so wasted with sorrow and confinement, you will
see every nerve and muscle as it suffers.

concern,--'tis cruelty to force him to go on with it.--give me hold of
the sermon, trim,--i'll finish it for thee, and thou may'st go. i must
stay and hear it too, replied trim, if your honour will allow me;--tho'
i would not read it myself for a colonel's pay.--poor trim! quoth my

without mercy, has prepared for him.'--(then, thank god,--he is dead,
quoth trim,--he is out of his pain,--and they have done their worst at
him.--o sirs!--hold your peace, trim, said my father, going on with the
sermon, lest trim should incense dr. slop,--we shall never have done at
this rate.)

'the surest way to try the merit of any disputed notion is, to trace
down the consequences such a notion has produced, and compare them with
the spirit of christianity;--'tis the short and decisive rule which our
saviour hath left us, for these and such like cases, and it is worth a
thousand arguments--by their fruits ye shall know them.

thou hast read the sermon extremely well, trim, quoth my father.--if he
had spared his comments, replied dr. slop,--he would have read it much
better. i should have read it ten times better, sir, answered trim, but
that my heart was so full.--that was the very reason, trim, replied my
father, which has made thee read the sermon as well as thou hast done;
and if the clergy of our church, continued my father, addressing himself
to dr. slop, would take part in what they deliver as deeply as this poor
fellow has done,--as their compositions are fine;--(i deny it, quoth
dr. slop)--i maintain it,--that the eloqu

continued my father, and i own it, sir, with sorrow, that, like french
politicians in this respect, what they gain in the cabinet they lose in
the field.--'twere a pity, quoth my uncle, that this should be lost. i
like the sermon well, replied my father,--'tis dramatick,--and there is
something in that way of writing, when skilfully managed, which catches
the attention.--we preach much in that way with us, said dr. slop.--i
know that very well, said my father,--but in a tone and manner which
disgusted dr. slop, full as much as his assent, simply, could have
pleased him.--but in this, added dr. slop, a little piqued,--our sermons
have greatly the advantage, that we never introduce any character
into them below a patriarch or a patriarch's wife, or a martyr or a
saint.--there are some very bad characters in this, however, said my
father, and i do not think the sermon a jot the worse for 'em.--but

obadiah gained the two crowns without dispute;--for he came in jingling,
with all the instruments in the green baize bag we spoke of, flung
across his body, just as corporal trim went out of the room.

we are in a condition to be of some service to mrs. shandy, to send up
stairs to know how she goes on.

i have ordered, answered my father, the old midwife to come down to us
upon the least difficulty;--for you must know, dr. slop, continued my
father, with a perplexed kind of a smile upon his countenance, that by
express treaty, solemnly ratified between me and my wife, you are no
more than an auxiliary in this affair,--and not so much as that,--unless

this prerogative with them, and give up some other rights in lieu of

quite dispassionate in what he said,--i know not, quoth he, what we have
left to give up, in lieu of who shall bring our children into the world,
unless that,--of who shall beget them.--one would almost give up
any thing, replied dr. slop.--i beg your pardon,--answered my uncle
toby.--sir, replied dr. slop, it would astonish you to know what
improvements we have made of late years in all branches of obstetrical
knowledge, but particularly in that one single point of the safe and
expeditious extraction of the foetus,--which has received such lights,
that, for my part (holding up his hand) i declare i wonder how the world

remind you
of one thing,--and to inform you of another.

what i have to inform you, comes, i own, a little out of its due
course;--for it should have been told a hundred and fifty pages ago,
but that i foresaw then 'twould come in pat hereafter, and be of more
advantage here than elsewhere.--writers had need look before them, to
keep up the spirit and connection of what they have in hand.

when these two things are done,--the curtain shall be drawn up again,
and my uncle toby, my father, and dr. slop, shall go on with their
discourse, without any more interruption.

first, then, the matter which i have to remind you of, is this;--that
from the specimens of singularity in my father's notions in the point of
christian-names, and that other previous point thereto,--you was led, i
think, into an opinion,--(and i am sure i said as much) that my father
was a gentleman altogether as odd and whimsical in fifty other opinions.
in truth, there was not a stage in the life of man, from the very first

error--(he would add, looking earnestly at my mother)--error, sir,
creeps in thro' the minute holes and small crevices which human nature
leaves unguarded.

this turn of thinking in my father, is what i had to remind you of:--the
point you are to be informed of, and which i have reserved for this
place, is as follows.

amongst the many and excellent reasons, with which my father had urged
my mother to accept of dr. slop's assistance preferably to that of the
old woman,--there was one of a very singular nature; which, when he had
done arguing the matter with her as a christian, and came to argue it
over again with her as a philosopher, he had put his whole strength to,
depending indeed upon it as his sheet-anchor.--it failed him, tho' from
no defect in the argument itself; but that, do what he could, he was
not able for his soul to make her comprehend the drift of it.--cursed
luck!--said he to himself, one afte

mother's first child,--coming
into the world with his head foremost,--and turning out afterwards a lad
of wonderful slow parts,--my father spelt all these together into his
opinion: and as he had failed at one end,--he was determined to try the
other.

this was not to be expected from one of the sisterhood, who are not
easily to be put out of their way,--and was therefore one of my father's
great reasons in favour of a man of science, whom he could better deal
with.

of all men in the world, dr. slop was the fittest for my father's
purpose;--for though this new-invented forceps was the armour he
had proved, and what he maintained to be the safest instrument of
deliverance, yet, it seems, he had scattered a word or two in his book,
in favour of the very thing which ran in my father's fancy;--tho' not
with a view to the soul's good in extracting by the feet, as was my
father's system,--but for reasons merely obstetrical.

this will account for the coalition betwixt my father and dr. slop,

not the sage alquise, the magician in don belianis of greece, nor the
no less famous urganda, the sorceress his wife, (were they alive) could
pretend to come within a league of the truth.

the reader will be content to wait for a full explanation of these
matters till the next year,--when a series of things will be laid open
which he little expects.



chapter 1.xlv.

--'i wish, dr. slop,' quoth my uncle toby, (repeating his wish for dr.
slop a second time, and with a degree of more zeal and earnestness in
his manner of wishing, than he had wished at first (vide.))--'i wish,
dr. slop,' quoth my uncle toby, 'you had seen what prodigious armies we
had in flanders.'

my uncle toby's wish did dr. slop a disservice which his heart never
intended any man,--sir, it confounded him--and thereby putting his ideas
first into confusion, and then to flight, he could not rally them again
for

n the case;--nothing is more
dangerous, madam, than a wish coming sideways in this unexpected manner
upon a man: the safest way in general to take off the force of the wish,
is for the party wish'd at, instantly to get upon his legs--and wish the
wisher something in return, of pretty near the same value,--so balancing
the account upon the spot, you stand as you were--nay sometimes gain the
advantage of the attack by it.

this will be fully illustrated to the world in my chapter of wishes.--

dr. slop did not understand the nature of this defence;--he was puzzled
with it, and it put an entire stop to the dispute for four minutes and a
half;--five had been fatal to it:--my father saw the danger--the dispute
was one of the most interesting disputes in the world, 'whether the
child of his prayers and endeavours should be born without a head or
with one:'--he waited to the last moment, to allow dr. slop, in whose
behalf the wish was made, his right of returning it; but perceiving, i
say, that he

ive, and healthy, and the mother did well after
it,--our forefathers never looked farther.--my uncle toby instantly
withdrew his hand from off my father's knee, reclined his body gently
back in his chair, raised his head till he could just see the cornice of
the room, and then directing the buccinatory muscles along his cheeks,
and the orbicular muscles around his lips to do their duty--he whistled
lillabullero.



chapter 1.li.

whilst my uncle toby was whistling lillabullero to my father,--dr. slop
was stamping, and cursing and damning at obadiah at a most dreadful
rate,--it would have done your heart good, and cured you, sir, for
ever of the vile sin of swearing, to have heard him, i am determined
therefore to relate the whole affair to you.

when dr. slop's maid delivered the green baize bag with her master's
instruments in it, to obadiah, she very sensibly exhorted him to put his
head and one arm through the strings, and ride with it slung across his
body: so undoing the bow-knot, to l

which offered; so taking hold of the bag and instruments, and
griping them hard together with one hand, and with the finger and thumb
of the other putting the end of the hat-band betwixt his teeth, and then
slipping his hand down to the middle of it,--he tied and cross-tied them
all fast together from one end to the other (as you would cord a trunk)
with such a multiplicity of round-abouts and intricate cross turns, with
a hard knot at every intersection or point where the strings met,--that
dr. slop must have had three fifths of job's patience at least to have
unloosed them.--i think in my conscience, that had nature been in one of
her nimble moods, and in humour for such a contest--and she and dr. slop
both fairly started together--there is no man living which had seen the
bag with all that obadiah had done to it,--and known likewise the great
speed the goddess can make when she thinks proper, who would have had
the least doubt remaining in his mind--which of the two would have

(which he had not done till the dispute with my uncle toby about
mid-wifery put him in mind of it)--the very same thought occurred.--'tis
god's mercy, quoth he (to himself) that mrs. shandy has had so bad a
time of it,--else she might have been brought to bed seven times told,
before one half of these knots could have got untied.--but here you must
distinguish--the thought floated only in dr. slop's mind, without sail
or ballast to it, as a simple proposition; million

a sudden trampling in the room above, near my mother's bed, did
the proposition the very service i am speaking of. by all that's
unfortunate, quoth dr. slop, unless i make haste, the thing will
actually befall me as it is.

in the case of knots,--by which, in the first place, i would not be
understood to mean slip-knots--because in the course of my life and
opinions--my opinions concerning them will come in more properly when i
mention the catastrophe of my great uncle mr. hammond shandy,--a
little man,--but of high fancy:--he rushed into the duke of monmouth's
affair:--nor, secondly, in this place, do i mean that particular specie

in the case of these knots then, and of the several obstructions, which,
may it please your reverences, such knots cast in our way in getting
through life--every hasty man can whip out his pen-knife and cut through
them.--'tis wrong. believe me, sirs, the most virtuous way, and which
both reason and conscience dictate--is to take our teeth or our fingers
to them.--dr. slop had lost his teeth--his favourite instrument, by
extracting in a wrong direction, or by some misapplication of it,
unfortunately slipping, he had formerly, in a hard labour, knock'd
out three of the best of them with the handle of it:--he tried his
fingers--alas; the nails of his fingers and thumbs were cut close.--the
duce take it! i can make nothing of it either way, cried dr. slop.--the
trampling over head near my mother's bed-side increased.--pox take the
fellow! i shall never get the knots

my father had a great respect for obadiah, and could not bear to hear
him disposed of in such a manner--he had moreover some little respect
for himself--and could as ill bear with the indignity offered to himself
in it.

had dr. slop cut any part about him, but his thumb--my father had pass'd
it by--his prudence had triumphed: as it was, he was determined to have
his revenge.

small curses, dr. slop, upon great occasions, quoth my father (condoling
with him first upon the accident) are but so much waste of our strength
and soul's health to no manner of purpose.--i own it, replied dr.

whistling) fired against a bastion.--they serve, continued my father,

considered by him, and such moreover as he could stand to, he kept them
ever by him on the chimney-piece, within his reach, ready for use.--i
never apprehended, replied dr. slop, that such a thing was ever thought
of--much less executed. i beg your pardon, answered my father; i was

morning, whilst he pour'd out the tea--'tis here upon the shelf over
my head;--but if i remember right, 'tis too violent for a cut of the

ernulphus himself--he put it into dr. slop's hands.--dr. slop wrapt his
thumb up in the corner of his handkerchief, and with a wry face, though
without any suspicion, read aloud, as follows--my uncle toby whistling
lillabullero as loud as he could all the time.

(as the geniuneness of the consultation of the sorbonne upon the
question of baptism, was doubted by some, and denied by others--'twas

father--as you have read it over, sir, so lately, to read it aloud--and
as captain shandy seems to have no great inclination to hear it--i
may as well read it to myself. that's contrary to treaty, replied my
father:--besides, there is something so whimsical, especially in the
latter part of it, i should grieve to lose the pleasure of a second
reading. dr. slop did not altogether like it,--but my uncle toby
offering at that instant to give over whistling, and read it himself to
them;--dr. slop thought he might as well read it under the cover of my
uncle toby's whistling--as suffer my uncle toby to read it alone;--so
raising up the paper to his face, and holding it quite parallel to it,
in order to hide his chagrin--he read it aloud as follows--my uncle toby
whistling lillabullero, though not quite so loud as before.

him, like a running bass all the way.) 'may he be cursed in eating and

might have become of the garrison of ghent, in the mutiny for bread,
in the year ten.--nor, replied dr. slop, (parodying my uncle toby's
hobby-horsical reflection; though full as hobby-horsical himself)--do
i know, captain shandy, what might have become of the garrison above
stairs, in the mutiny and confusion i find all things are in at present,
but for the subordination of fingers and thumbs to...--the application
of which, sir, under this accident of mine, comes in so a propos, that
without it, the cut upon my thumb might have been felt by the shandy
family, as long as the shandy family had a name.

chapter 2.viii.

dr. slop was within an ace of being an exception to all this
argumentation: for happening to have his green baize bag upon his knees,
when he began to parody my uncle toby--'twas as good as the best mantle
in the world to him: for which purpose, when he foresaw the sentence
would end in his new-invented forceps, he thrust his hand into the bag
in order to have them ready to clap in, when your reverences took so
much notice of the..., which had he managed--my uncle toby had certainly
been overthrown: the
 
 ___________________________
 
 sentence and the argument in that case jumping
closely in one point, so like the two lines which form the salient angle
of a ravelin,--dr. slop would never have given them up;--and my uncle
toby would as soon have thought of flying, as taking them by force: but
dr. slop fumbled so vilely in pulling them out, it took off the whole
effect, and what was a ten times worse evil (for they seldom come alone
in this life) in pulling out his forceps, his forceps unfortunately drew
out the squirt along with it.

when a proposition can be taken in two senses--'tis a law in
disputation, that the respondent may reply to which of the two he
pleases, or finds most convenient for him.--this threw the advantage of
the argument quite on my uncle toby's side.--'good god!' cried

toby, 'are children brought into the world with a squirt?'



chapter 2.ix.

--upon my honour, sir, you have tore every bit of skin quite off the
back of both my hands with your forceps, cried my uncle toby--and you
have crush'd all my knuckles into the bargain with them to a jelly. 'tis
your own fault, said dr. slop--you should have clinch'd your two fists
together into the form of a child's head as i told you, and sat firm.--i
did so, answered my uncle toby.--then the points of my forceps have not
been sufficiently arm'd, or the rivet wants closing--or else the cut on
my thumb has made me a little aukward--or possibly--'tis well, quoth my
father, interrupting the detail of possibilities--that the experiment
was not first made upon my child's head-piece.--it would not have been a
cherry-stone the worse, an

swered dr. slop.--i maintain it, said my uncle
toby, it would have broke the cerebellum (unless indeed the skull
had been as hard as a granado) and turn'd it all into a perfect
posset.--pshaw! replied dr. slop, a child's head is naturally as soft
as the pap of an apple;--the sutures give way--and besides, i could
have extracted by the feet after.--not you, said she.--i rather wish you
would begin that way, quoth my father.

pray do, added my uncle toby.



chapter 2.x.

--and pray, good woman, after all, will you take upon you to say, it
may not be the child's hip, as well as the child's head?--'tis most
certainly the head, replied the midwife. because, continued dr. slop
(turning to my father) as po

sitive as these old ladies generally
are--'tis a point very difficult to know--and yet of the greatest
consequence to be known;--because, sir, if the hip is mistaken for the
head--there is a possibility (if it is a boy) that the forceps....

--what the possibility was, dr. slop whispered very low to my father,
and then to my uncle toby.--there is no such danger, continued he, with
the head.--no, in truth quoth my father--but when your possibility has
taken place at the hip--you may as well take off the head too.

--it is morally impossible the reader should understand this--'tis
enough dr. slop understood it;--so taking the green baize bag in his
hand, with the help of obadiah's pumps, he tripp'd pretty nimbly, for
a man of his size, across the room to the door--and f

it is two hours, and ten minutes--and no more--cried my father, looking
at his watch, since dr. slop and obadiah arrived--and i know not how it
happens, brother toby--but to my imagination it seems almost an age.

--here--pray, sir, take hold of my cap--nay, take the bell along with
it, and my pantoufles too.

now, sir, they are all at your service; and i freely make you a present
of 'em, on condition you give me all your attention to this chapter.

though my father said, 'he knew not how it happen'd,'--yet he knew
very well how it happen'd;--and at the instant he spoke it, was
pre-determined

in his mind to give my uncle toby a clear account of the
matter by a metaphysical dissertation upon the subject of duration and
its simple modes, in order to shew my uncle toby by what mechanism and
mensurations in the brain it came to pass, that the rapid succession of
their ideas, and the eternal scampering of the discourse from one thing
to another, since dr. slop had come into the room, had lengthened out
so short a period to so inconceivable an extent.--'i know not how it
happens--cried my father,--but it seems an age.'

--'tis owing entirely, quoth my uncle toby, to the succession of our
ideas.

my father, who had an itch, in common with all philosophers, of
reasoning upon every thing which happened, and accounting for it
too--proposed infinite pleasure to himself in this, of the succession of
ideas, and had not the least apprehension of having it sna

himself, and philosophize about it: but his spirits being wore out with
the fatigues of investigating new tracts, and the constant exertion of
his faculties upon that variety of subjects which had taken their turn
in the discourse--the idea of the smoke jack soon turned all his ideas
upside down--so that he fell asleep almost before he knew what he was
about.

as for my uncle toby, his smoke-jack had not made a dozen revolutions,
before he fell asleep also.--peace be with them both!--dr. slop is
engaged with the midwife and my mother above stairs.--trim is busy
in turning an old pair of jack-boots into a couple of mortars, to be
employed in the siege of messina next summer--and is this instant boring
the touch-holes with the point of a hot poker.--all my heroes are off my
hands;--'tis the first time i have had a moment to spare--and i'll make
use of it, and write my preface.

declared, of the whole sweets of it.

'when things move upon bad hinges, an' please your lordships, how can it

moment the door began to creak.--i wish the smith would give a peep at
that confounded hinge.--'tis nothing, an please your honour, said trim,
but two mortars i am bringing in.--they shan't make a clatter with them
here, cried my father hastily.--if dr. slop has any drugs to pound, let
him do it in the kitchen.--may it please your honour, cried trim, they
are two mortar-pieces for a siege next summer, which i have been making
out of a pair of jack-boots, which obadiah told me your honour had left
off wearing.--by heaven! cried my father, springing out of his chair,
as he swore--i have not one appointment belonging to me, which i set
so much store by as i do by these jack-boots--they were our great
grandfather's brother toby--they were hereditary. t

the generous (though hobby-horsical) gallantry of my uncle toby, brought

my father to himself.



chapter 2.xvi.

all is quiet and hush, cried my father, at least above stairs--i hear
not one foot stirring.--prithee trim, who's in the kitchen? there is no
one soul in the kitchen, answered trim, making a low bow as he spoke,
except dr. slop.--confusion! cried my father (getting upon his legs a
second time)--not one single thing has gone right this day! had i faith
in astrology, brother, (which, by the bye, my father had) i would have
sworn some retrograde planet was hanging over this unfortunate house of
mine, and turning every individual thing in it out of its place.--why,
i thought dr. slop had been above stairs with my wife, and so said
you.--what can the fellow be puzzling about in the kitchen!--he is busy,

mistook the mortars:--but to understand how my uncle toby could mistake
the bridge--i fear i must give you an exact account of the road which
led to it;--or to drop my metaphor (for there is nothing more dishonest
in an historian than the use of one)--in order to conceive the
probability of this error in my uncle toby aright, i must give you some

inasmuch as the construction of them was a curve line approximating to a

my uncle toby understood the nature of a parabola as well as any man
in england--but was not quite such a master of the cycloid;--he talked
however about it every day--the bridge went not forwards.--we'll ask
somebody about it, cried my uncle toby to trim.



chapter 2.xix.

when trim came in and told my father, that dr. slop was in the kitchen,
and busy in making a bridge--my uncle toby--the affair of the jack-boots
having just then raised a train of military ideas in his brain--took it
instantly for granted that dr. slop was making a model of the marquis
d'hopital's bridge.--'tis very obliging in him, quoth my uncle
toby;--pray give my humble service to dr. slop, trim, and tell him i
thank him heartily.

thirty-five seconds about it in the present case.

by all that's good! said my father, swearing, as he came to himself, and
taking the oath out of ernulphus's digest of curses--(though to do my
father justice it was a fault (as he told dr. slop in the affair of
ernulphus) which he as seldom committed as any man upon earth)--by all
that's good and great! brother toby, said my father, if it was not for
the aids of philosophy, which befriend one so much as they do--you would
put a man beside all temper.--why, by the solutions of noses, of which
i was telling you, i meant, as you might have known, had you favoured me

father, and it will turn out a million to one, that of all the parts of
the body, the edge of the forceps should have the ill luck just to fall
upon and break down that one part, which should break down the fortunes
of our house with it.

it might have been worse, replied my uncle toby.--i don't comprehend,
said my father.--suppose the hip had presented, replied my uncle toby,
as dr. slop foreboded.

my father reflected half a minute--looked down--touched the middle of
his forehead slightly with his finger--

--true, said he.



chapter 2.xlv.

is it not a shame to make two chapters of what passed in going down one
pair of stairs? for we are got no farther yet than to the first landing,
and there are fifteen more steps down to the bottom; and for aught i
know, as my father and my uncle toby are in a talking humour, there may
be as many chapters as steps:--let that be as it will,

-and how does your mistress? cried my father, taking the same step over
again from the landing, and calling to susannah, whom he saw passing
by the foot of the stairs with a huge pin-cushion in her hand--how does
your mistress? as well, said susannah, tripping by, but without looking
up, as can be expected.--what a fool am i! said my father, drawing his
leg back again--let things be as they will, brother toby, 'tis ever the
precise answer--and how is the child, pray?--no answer. and where is
dr. slop? added my father, raising his voice aloud, and looking over the
ballusters--susannah was out of hearing.

of all the riddles of a married life, said my father, crossing the
landing in order to set his back against the wall, whilst he propounded
it to my uncle toby--of all the puzzling riddles, said he, in a marriage

loads than all job's stock of asses could have carried--there is not one

a postillion who drove them from stilton to stamford, the thought had

three miles and a half--we scarce touched the ground--the motion was

hanging great weights upon small wires,--and i am this day (august

examine us altogether.--

interrupting him, what herbs?--for that, replied my father, you must

my mother went down, and my father went on, reading the section as
follows,

...--very well,--said my father,...--nay, if it has that
convenience--and so without stopping a moment to settle it first in his
mind, whether the jews had it from the egyptians, or the egyptians

into his mouth.--then let the corporal go on, said my father, with his
medical lecture.--the corporal made a bow to his old friend, dr. slop,
and then delivered his opinion concerning radical heat and radical
moisture, in the following words.

there was such a quantity of rain fell during the siege, the whole

nothing but ditch-water--and a dram of geneva--and give us but enough
of it, with a pipe of tobacco, to give us spirits, and drive away the
vapours--we know not what it is to fear death.

i am at a loss, captain shandy, quoth doctor slop, to determine in which
branch of learning your servant shines most, whether in physiology or
divinity.--slop had not forgot trim's comment upon the sermon.--

it is but an hour ago, replied yorick, since the corporal was examined
in the latter, and passed muster with great honour.--

the radical heat and moisture, quoth doctor slop, turning to my father,
you must know, is the basis and foundation of our being--as the root of

discourse upon this nice point.--that he has,--said my father.--very

when the cataplasm was ready, a scruple of decorum had unseasonably rose
up in susannah's conscience, about holding the candle, whilst slop tied
it on; slop had not treated susannah's distemper with anodynes,--and so
a quarrel had ensued betwixt them.

--oh! oh!--said slop, casting a glance of undue freedom in susannah's
face, as she declined the office;--then, i think i know you, madam--you
know me, sir! cried susannah fastidiously, and with a toss of her
head, levelled evidently, not at his profession, but at the doctor
himself,--you know me! cried susannah again.--doctor slop clapped his

it was almost impossible for two persons to assist each other in a
surgical case with a more splenetic cordiality.

slop snatched up the cataplasm--susannah snatched up the candle;--a

returning the compliment with what was left in the pan.

doctor slop and susannah filed cross-bills against each other in the

by means of a large role of packthread, and a number of small piquets
driven into the ground, at the several angles and redans, he transferred
the lines from his paper; then taking the profile of the place, with its
works, to determine the depths and slopes of the ditches,--the talus of
the glacis, and the precise height of the several banquets, parapets,

mother was brought to bed of me--i beseech you, quoth my uncle toby, to
tell me which is the blind gut; for, old as i am, i vow i do not know to
this day where it lies.

the blind gut, answered doctor slop, lies betwixt the ilion and colon--

in a man? said my father.

--'tis precisely the same, cried doctor slop, in a woman.--

that's more than i know; quoth my father.

! dear brother toby, said my father, upon his first seeing him after
he fell in love--and how goes it with your asse?

now my uncle toby thinking more of the part where he had had the
blister, than of hilarion's metaphor--and our preconceptions having (you
know) as great a power over the sounds of words as the shapes of things,
he had imagined, that my father, who was not very ceremonious in his
choice of words, had enquired after the part by its proper name: so
notwithstanding my mother, doctor slop, and mr. yorick, were sitting in
the parlour, he thought it rather civil to conform to the term my father
had made use of than not. when a man is hemm'd in by two indecorums, and
must commit one of 'em--i always observe--let him chuse which he will,
the world will blame him--so i should not be astonished if it blames my
uncle toby.

my a..e, quoth my uncle toby, is much better--brother shandy--my father
had formed great expectations from his asse in this onset; and would
have brought him on aga

in; but doctor slop setting up an intemperate
laugh--and my mother crying out l... bless us!--it drove my father's
asse off the field--and the laugh then becoming general--there was no
bringing him back to the charge, for some time--

and so the discourse went on without him.

every body, said my mother, says you are in love, brother toby,--and we
hope it is true.

i am as much in love, sister, i believe, replied my uncle toby, as any
man usually is--humph! said my father--and when did you know it? quoth

let down from heaven, excites
to love heroic, which comprehends in it, and excites to the desire of
philosophy and truth--the second, excites to desire, simply--

--i think the procreation of children as beneficial to the world, said
yorick, as the finding out the longitude--

--to be sure, said my mother, love keeps peace in the world--

--in the house--my dear, i own--

--it replenishes the earth; said my mother--

but it keeps heaven empty--my dear; replied my father.

--'tis virginity, cried slop, triumphantly, which fills paradise.

well push'd nun! quoth my father.



chapter 4.lviii.

my father had such a skirmishing, cutting kind of a slashing way with
him in his disputations, thrusting and ripping, and giving every one a
stroke to remember him by in his turn--that if there were twenty people
in company--in less than half an hour he was sure to have every one of
'em against him.

what did not a little contribute to leave him thus without an ally, was,
that if there was any one post

more untenable than the rest, he would be
sure to throw himself into it; and to do him justice, when he was
once there, he would defend it so gallantly, that 'twould have been a
concern, either to a brave man or a good-natured one, to have seen him
driven out.

yorick, for this reason, though he would often attack him--yet could
never bear to do it with all his force.

doctor slop's virginity, in the close of the last chapter, had got him
for once on the right side of the rampart; and he was beginning to blow
up all the convents in christendom about slop's ears, when corporal trim
came into the parlour to inform my uncle toby, that his thin scarlet
breeches, in which the attack was to be made upon mrs. wadman, would not
do; for that the taylor, in ripping them up, in order to turn them, had
found they had been turn'd before--then turn them again, brother, said
my father,

he odds look more
considerable--i would lay, an' please your honour, my montero-cap to a
shilling--was it proper, continued trim (making a bow), to offer a wager
before your honours--

--there is nothing improper in it, said my father--'tis a mode of
expression; for in saying thou would'st lay thy montero-cap to a
shilling--all thou meanest is this--that thou believest--

--now, what do'st thou believe?

that widow wadman, an' please your worship, cannot hold it out ten
days--

and whence, cried slop, jeeringly, hast thou all this knowledge of
woman, friend?

by falling in love with a popish clergy-woman; said trim.

'twas a beguine, said my uncle toby.

doctor slop was too much in wrath to listen to the distinction; and my
father taking that very crisis to fall in helter-skelter upon the whole
order of nuns and beguines, a set of silly, fusty, baggages--slop could
not stand it--and my uncle toby having some measures to take about his
breeches--and yorick about his fourth general division--

s, in the one case than in the other.

she had accordingly read drake's anatomy from one end to the other. she
had peeped into wharton upon the brain, and borrowed graaf (this must be
a mistake in mr. shandy; for graaf wrote upon the pancreatick juice,
and the parts of generation.) upon the bones and muscles; but could make
nothing of it.

she had reason'd likewise from her own powers--laid down theorems--drawn
consequences, and come to no conclusion.

to clear up all, she had twice asked doctor slop, 'if poor captain
shandy was ever likely to recover of his wound--?'

--he is recovered, doctor slop would say--

what! quite?

quite: madam--

but what do you mean by a recovery? mrs. wadman would say.

doctor slop was the worst man alive at definitions; and so mrs. wadman
could get no knowledge: in short, there was no way to extract it, but
from my uncle toby himself.

there is an accent of humanity in an enquiry of this kind which lulls
suspicion to rest--and i am half persuaded the serpent

on the bull.

now the parish being very large, my father's bull, to speak the truth of
him, was no way equal to the department; he had, however, got himself,
somehow or other, thrust into employment--and as he went through the
business with a grave face, my father had a high opinion of him.

--most of the townsmen, an' please your worship, quoth obadiah, believe
that 'tis all the bull's fault--

--but may not a cow be barren? replied my father, turning to doctor
slop.

it never happens: said dr. slop, but the man's wife may have come
before her time naturally enough--prithee has the child hair upon his
head?--added dr. slop--

--it is as hairy as i am; said obadiah.--obadiah had not been shaved for
three weeks--wheu...u...u...cried my father; beginning the sentence with
an exclamatory whistle--and so, brother toby, this poor bull of mine,
who is as good a bull as ever p..ss'd, and might have done for europa
herself in purer times--had he but two legs less, might have been driven
into doctor
