        the heavenly father had been most merciful to me in leading me to this place. mrs. bruce was a kind and gentle lady, and proved a true and sympathizing friend. before the stipulated month expired, the necessity of

passing up and down stairs frequently, caused my limbs to swell so painfully, that i became unable to perform my duties. many ladies would have thoughtlessly discharged me; but mrs. bruce made arrangements to save me steps, and employed a physician to attend upon me. i had not yet told her that i was a fugitive slave. she noticed that i was often sad, and kindly

y children, and from relatives who were dear to me; but i did not mention the constant feeling of insecurity which oppressed my spirits. i longed for some one to confide in; but i had been so deceived by white people, that i had lost all confidence in them. if they spoke kind words to me, i thought it was for some selfish purpose. i had entered this family with the distrustful feelings i had brought with me out of slavery; but ere six months had passed, i found that the gentle deportment of mrs. bruce and the smiles of her lovely babe were thawing my chilled heart. my narrow mind also began to expand under the influences of her intelligent conversation, and the opportunities for reading, which were gladly allowed me whenever i had leisure from my duties. i gradually became more energetic and more cheerful.

        the old feeling of insecurity, especially with regard to my children, often threw its dark shadow across my sunshine. mrs. bruce offered me a home for ellen; but pleasant as it wou

ars of my earnings were expended to keep my child comfortably clothed. that, however, was a slight trouble, compared with the fear that their pecuniary embarrassments might induce them to sell my precious young daughter. i knew they were in constant communication with southerners, and had frequent opportunities to do it. i have stated that when dr. flint put ellen in jail, at two years old, she had an inflammation of the eyes, occasioned by measles. this disease still troubled her; and kind mrs. bruce proposed that she should come to new york for a while, to be under the care of dr. elliott, a well known oculist. it did not occur to me that there was any thing improper in a mother's making such a request; but mrs. hobbs was very angry, and refused to let her go. situated as i was, it was not politic to insist upon it. i made no complaint, but i longed to be entirely free to act a mother's part towards my children. the next time i went over to brooklyn, mrs. hobbs, as if to apologize for her a

        not long afterwards i received a letter from one of my friends at the south, informing me that dr. flint was about to visit the north. the letter had been delayed, and i supposed he might be already on the

prejudice against color.

        it was a relief to my mind to see preparations for leaving the city. we went to albany in the steamboat knickerbocker. when the gong sounded for tea, mrs. bruce said, "linda, it is late, and you and baby had better come to the table with me." i replied, "i know it is time baby had her supper, but i had rather not go with you, if you please. i am afraid of being insulted." "o no, not if you are with me," she said. i saw several white nurses go with their ladies, and i ventured to do the same. we were at the extreme end of the table. i was no sooner seated, than a gruff voice said, "get up! you know you are not allowed to sit here." i looked up, and, to m

        next morning, when we stopped at troy for breakfast, every body was making a rush for the table. mrs. bruce said, "take my arm, linda, and we'll go in together." the landlord heard her, and said, "madam, will you allow your nurse and baby to take

        at saratoga we found the united states hotel crowded, and mr. bruce took one of the cottages belonging to the hotel. i had thought, with gladness, of going to the quiet of the country, where i should meet few people, but here i found myself in the midst of a swarm of southerners. i looked round me with fear and trembling, dreading to see some one who would recognize me. i was rejoiced to find that we were to stay but a short time.

        we soon returned to new york, to make arrangements for spending the remainder of the summer at rockaway. while the laundress

 was putting the clothes in order, i took an opportunity to go over to brooklyn to see ellen. i met her going to a grocery store, and the first words she said, were, "o, mother, don't go to mrs. hobbs's. her brother, mr. thorne, has come from the south, and may be he'll tell where you are." i accepted the warning. i told her i was going away with mrs. bruce the next day, and would try to see her when i came back.

        being in servitude to the anglo-saxon race, i was not put into a "jim crow car," on our way to rockaway, neither was i invited to ride through the streets on the top of trunks in a truck; but every where i found the same manifestations of that cruel prejudice, which so discourages the feelings, and represses the energies of the colored people. we reached rockaway before dark, and put up at the pavilion—a large hotel, beautifully

        this was the climax! i found it hard to preserve my self-control, when i looked round, and saw women who were nurses, as i was, and only one shade lighter in complexion, eyeing me with a defiant look, as if my presence were a contamination. however, i said nothing. i quietly took the child in my arms, went to our room, and refused to go to the table again. mr. bruce ordered meals to be sent to the room for little mary and i. this answered for a few days; but the waiters of the establishment were white, and they soon began to complain, saying they were not hired to wait on negroes. the landlord requested mr. bruce to send me down to my meals, because his servants rebelled against bringing them up, and the colored servants of other boarders were dissatisfied because all were not treated alike.

        my answer was that the colored servants ought to be

when he returned, his sister accused him of it, and he did not deny the charge. he went immediately to his room, and the next morning he was missing. he had gone over to new york, before any of the family were astir.

        it was evident that i had no time to lose; and i hastened back to the city with a heavy heart. again i was to be torn from a comfortable home, and all my plans for the welfare of my children were to be frustrated by that demon slavery! i now regretted that i never told mrs. bruce my story. i had not concealed it merely on account of being a fugitive; that would have made her anxious, but it would have excited sympathy in her kind heart. i valued her good opinion, and i was afraid of losing it, if i told her all the particulars of my sad story. but now i felt that it was necessary for her to know how i was situated. i had once left her abruptly, without explaining the reason, and it would not be proper to do it again. i went home resolved to tell her in the morning. but t

if the case came to trial. mrs. bruce took me in a carriage to the house of one of her friends, where she assured me i should be safe until my brother could arrive, which would be in a few days. in the interval my thoughts were much occupied with ellen. she was mine by birth, and she was also mine by southern law, since my grandmother held the bill of sale that made her so. i did not feel that she was safe unless i had her with me. mrs. hobbs, who felt badly about her brother's treachery, yielded to my entreaties, on condition that

she should return in ten days. i avoided making any promise. she came to me clad in very thin garments, all outgrown, and with a school satchel on her arm, containing a few articles. it was late in october, and i knew the child must suffer; and not daring to go out in the streets to purchase any thing, i took off my own flannel skirt and converted it into one for her. kind mrs. bruce came to bid me good by, and when she saw that i had taken off my clothing for my child, the tears came to her eyes. she said, "wait for me, linda," and went out. she soon returned with a nice warm shawl and hood for ellen. truly, of such souls as hers are the kingdom of heaven.

a visit to england.

        in the spring, sad news came to me. mrs. bruce was dead. never again, in this world, should i see her gentle face, or hear her sympathizing voice. i had lost an excellent friend, and little mary had lost a tender mother. mr. bruce wished the child to visit some of her mother's relatives in england, and he was desirous that i should take charge of her. the little motherless one was accustomed to me, and attached to me, and i thought she would be happier in my care than in that of a stranger. i could also earn more in this way than i could by

        as i had constant care of the child, i had little opportunity to see the wonders of that great city; but i watched the tide of life that flowed through the streets, and found it a strange contrast to the stagnation in our southern towns. mr. bruce took his little daughter to spend some days with friends in oxford crescent, and of course it was necessary for me to accompany her. i had heard much of the systematic method of english education, and i was very desirous that my dear mary should steer straight in the midst of so much propriety. i closely observed her little playmates and their nurses, being ready to take any lessons in the science of good management. the children were more rosy than american children, but i did not see that they

and as for the system of slavery, she had a most hearty dislike of it. no sophistry of southerners could blind her to its enormity. she was a person of excellent principles and a noble heart. to me, from that hour to the present, she has been a true and sympathizing friend. blessings be with her and hers!

        about the time that i reëntered the bruce family, an event occurred of disastrous import to the colored people. the slave hamlin, the first fugitive that came under the new law, was given up by the bloodhounds of the north to the bloodhounds of the south. it was the beginning of a reign of terror to the colored population. the great city rushed on in its whirl of excitement, taking no note of the "short and simple annals of the poor." but while fashionables were listening to the thrilling voice of jenny lind in metropolitan hall, the th

        i immediately informed mrs. bruce of my danger, and she took prompt measures for my safety. my place as nurse could not be supplied immediately, and this generous, sympathizing lady proposed that i should carry her baby away. it was a comfort to me to have the child with me; for the heart is reluctant to be torn away from every object it loves. but how few mothers would have consented to have one of their own babes become a fugitive, for the sake of a poor, hunted nurse, on whom the legislators of the country had let loose the b

le we were sleeping. he might at that moment be waiting to pounce upon me if i ventured out of doors. i had never seen the husband of my young mistress, and therefore i could not distinguish him from any other stranger. a carriage was hastily ordered; and, closely veiled, i followed mrs. bruce, taking the baby again with me into exile. after various turnings and crossings

and returnings, the carriage stopped at the house of one of mrs. bruce's friends, where i was kindly received. mrs. bruce returned immediately, to instruct the domestics what to say if any one came to inquire for me.

        it was lucky for me that the evening paper was not burned up before i had a chance to examine the list of arrivals. it was not long after mrs. bruce's return to her house, before several people came to inquire for me. one inquired for me, another asked for my daughter ellen, and another said he had a letter from my grandmother, which he was requested to deliver in person.

        this made mr. dodge very angry, and some high words passed between them. my friend was afraid to

slavery; that such a great obligation could not be easily cancelled; and that i preferred to go to my brother in california.

        without my knowledge, mrs. bruce employed a gentleman in new york to enter into negotiations with mr. dodge. he proposed to pay three hundred dollars down, if mr. dodge would sell me, and enter into obligations to relinquish all claim to me or my children forever after. he who called himself my master said he scorned so small an offer for such a valuable servant. the gentleman replied, "you can do as you choose, sir. if you reject this offer you will never get any thing; for the woman has friends who will convey her and her chi
