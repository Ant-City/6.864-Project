[CHARACTER] - 
                 the
nonfictional taxi driver who takes vonnegut and o'hare back to their
dresden slaughterhouse. muller later sends o'hare a christmas card
bearing tidings of peace, and vonnegut dedicates the novel in part
to muller--two simple gestures of sympathy that stand out amid the
novel's pervasive cruelty and violence.
