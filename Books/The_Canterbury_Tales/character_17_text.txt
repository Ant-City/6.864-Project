notes to the prologue to the doctor's tale


1. the authenticity of the prologue is questionable. it is found in
one manuscript only; other manuscripts give other prologues,
more plainly not chaucer's than this; and some manuscripts
have merely a colophon to the effect that "here endeth the
franklin's tale and beginneth the physician's tale without a
prologue." the tale itself is the well-known story of virginia,
with several departures from the text of livy. chaucer probably
followed the "romance of the rose" and gower's "confessio
amantis," in both of which the story is found.

 profitable, but truly mine heart is troubled with this
sorrow so grievously, that i know not what to do."  "let call,"
quoth prudence, "thy true friends all, and thy lineage, which be
wise, and tell to them your case, and hearken what they say in
counselling, and govern you after their sentence [opinion].
solomon saith, 'work all things by counsel, and thou shall never
repent.'" then, by counsel of his wife prudence, this meliboeus
let call [sent for] a great congregation of folk, as surgeons,
physicians, old folk and young, and some of his old enemies
reconciled (as by their semblance) to his love and to his grace;
and therewithal there come some of his neighbours, that did him
reverence more for dread than for love, as happeneth oft. there
come also full many subtle flatterers, and wise advocates
learned in the law. and when these folk together assembled
were, this meliboeus in sorrowful wise showed them his case,
and by the manner of his speech it seemed that in heart he bare

two men have wounded each other, one same surgeon healeth
them both; wherefore unto our art it is not pertinent to nurse
war, nor parties to support [take sides].  but certes, as to the
warishing [healing] of your daughter, albeit so that perilously
she be wounded, we shall do so attentive business from day to
night, that, with the grace of god, she shall be whole and
sound, as soon as is possible." almost right in the same wise the
physicians answered, save that they said a few words more: that
right as maladies be cured by their contraries, right so shall man
warish war (by peace). his neighbours full of envy, his feigned
friends that seemed reconciled, and his flatterers, made
semblance of weeping, and impaired and agregged [aggravated]
much of this matter, in praising greatly meliboeus of might, of
power, of riches, and of friends, despising the power of his
adversaries: and said utterly, that he anon should wreak him on

movement of folly; and points out that he has erred in sundry
wise against the rules which he had just laid down. granting
that he has erred, meliboeus says that he is all ready to change
his counsel right as she will devise; for, as the proverb runs, to
do sin is human, but to persevere long in sin is work of the
devil. prudence then minutely recites, analyses, and criticises
the counsel given to her husband in the assembly of his friends.
she commends the advice of the physicians and surgeons, and
urges that they should be well rewarded for their noble speech
and their services in healing sophia; and she asks meliboeus
how he understands their proposition that one contrary must be
cured by another contrary. meliboeus answers, that he should
do vengeance on his enemies, who had done him wrong.
prudence, however, insists that vengeance is not the contrary of
vengeance, nor wrong of wrong, but the like; and that
wickedness should be healed by goodness, discord by accord,

ream to his sister cassandra, who
told him that the boar betokened diomede, and that,
wheresoever his lady was, diornede certainly had her heart, and
she was his: "weep if thou wilt, or leave, for, out of doubt, this
diomede is in, and thou art out." troilus, enraged, refused to
believe cassandra's interpretation; as well, he cried, might such
a story be credited of alcestis, who devoted her life for her
husband; and in his wrath he started from bed, "as though all
whole had him y-made a leach [physician]," resolving to find
out the truth at all hazards. the death of hector meanwhile
enhanced the sorrow which he endured; but he found time to
write often to cressida, beseeching her to come again and hold
her truth; till one day his false mistress, out of pity, wrote him
again, in these terms:
