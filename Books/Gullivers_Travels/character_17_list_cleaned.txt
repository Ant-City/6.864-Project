[CHARACTER] - 
                the
commander of the ship on which gulliver first
sails, the swallow. traveling to the levant, or
the eastern mediterranean, and beyond, gulliver spends three and
a half years on pannell's ship. virtually nothing is mentioned about
pannell, which heightens our sense that gulliver's fascination with
exotic types is not matched by any interest in his fellow countrymen.
