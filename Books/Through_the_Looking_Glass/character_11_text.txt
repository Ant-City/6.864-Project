e cried in a triumphant tone. ‘now you
shall see me pin it on again, all by myself!’

‘then i hope your finger is better now?’ alice said very politely, as
she crossed the little brook after the queen.

    *    *    *    *    *    *

‘oh, much better!’ cried the queen, her voice rising to a squeak as she
went on. ‘much be-etter! be-etter! be-e-e-etter! be-e-ehh!’ the last
word ended in a long bleat, so like a sheep that alice quite started.

she looked at the queen, who seemed to have suddenly wrapped herself up
in wool. alice rubbed her eyes, and looked again. she couldn’t make out
what had happened at all. was she in a shop? and was that really--was it
really a sheep that was sitting on the other side of the counter? rub as
she could, she could make nothing more of it: she was in a little dark
shop, leaning with her elbows on the counter, and opposite to her was
an old sheep, sitting in an arm-chair k

nitting, and every now and then
leaving off to look at her through a great pair of spectacles.

‘what is it you want to buy?’ the sheep said at last, looking up for a
moment from her knitting.

‘i don’t quite know yet,’ alice said, very gently. ‘i should like to
look all round me first, if i might.’

‘you may look in front of you, and on both sides, if you like,’ said the
sheep: ‘but you can’t look all round you--unless you’ve got eyes at the
back of your head.’

but these, as it happened, alice had not got: so she contented herself
with turning round, looking at the shelves as she came to them.

the shop seemed to be full of all manner of curious things--but the
oddest part of it all was, that whenever she looked hard at any shelf,
to make out exactly what it had on it, that particular shelf was always
quite empty: though the others round it were crowded as f

doll and sometimes like a work-box, and was
always in the shelf next above the one she was looking at. ‘and this one
is the most provoking of all--but i’ll tell you what--’ she added, as a
sudden thought struck her, ‘i’ll follow it up to the very top shelf of
all. it’ll puzzle it to go through the ceiling, i expect!’

but even this plan failed: the ‘thing’ went through the ceiling as
quietly as possible, as if it were quite used to it.

‘are you a child or a teetotum?’ the sheep said, as she took up another
pair of needles. ‘you’ll make me giddy soon, if you go on turning round
like that.’ she was now working with fourteen pairs at once, and alice
couldn’t help looking at her in great astonishment.

‘how can she knit with so many?’ the puzzled child thought to herself.
‘she gets more and more like a porcupine every minute!’

‘can you row?’ the sheep asked, handing her a pair of knitting-needles
as she spoke.

‘yes, a little--but not on land--and n

ot with needles--’ alice was
beginning to say, when suddenly the needles turned into oars in her
hands, and she found they were in a little boat, gliding along between
banks: so there was nothing for it but to do her best.

‘feather!’ cried the sheep, as she took up another pair of needles.

this didn’t sound like a remark that needed any answer, so alice said
nothing, but pulled away. there was something very queer about the
water, she thought, as every now and then the oars got fast in it, and
would hardly come out again.

‘feather! feather!’ the sheep cried again, taking more needles. ‘you’ll
be catching a crab directly.’

‘a dear little crab!’ thought alice. ‘i should like that.’

‘didn’t you hear me say “feath

er”?’ the sheep cried angrily, taking up
quite a bunch of needles.

‘indeed i did,’ said alice: ‘you’ve said it very often--and very loud.
please, where are the crabs?’

‘in the water, of course!’ said the sheep, sticking some of the needles
into her hair, as her hands were full. ‘feather, i say!’

‘why do you say “feather” so often?’ alice asked at last, rather vexed.
‘i’m not a bird!’

‘you are,’ said the sheep: ‘you’re a little goose.’

this offended alice a little, so there was no more conversation for a
minute or two, while the boat glided gently on, sometimes among beds of
weeds (which made the oars stick fast in the water, worse then ever),
and sometimes under trees, but always with the same tall river-banks
frowning over their heads.

‘oh, please! there are some scented rushes!’ alice cried in a sudden
transport of delight. ‘there really are--and such beauties!’

‘you needn’t s

ay “please” to me about ‘em,’ the sheep said, without
looking up from her knitting: ‘i didn’t put ‘em there, and i’m not going
to take ‘em away.’

‘no, but i meant--please, may we wait and pick some?’ alice pleaded. ‘if
you don’t mind stopping the boat for a minute.’

‘how am _i_ to stop it?’ said the sheep. ‘if you leave off rowing, it’ll
stop of itself.’

so the boat was left to drift down the stream as it would, till it
glided gently in among the waving rushes. and then the little sleeves
were carefully rolled up, and the little arms were plunged in elbow-deep
to get the rushes a good long way down before breaking them off--and for
a while alice forgot all about the sheep and the knitting, as she
bent over the side of the boat, with just the ends of her tangled hair
dipping into the water

his, there were
so many other curious things to think about.

they hadn’t gone much farther before the blade of one of the oars got
fast in the water and wouldn’t come out again (so alice explained it
afterwards), and the consequence was that the handle of it caught her
under the chin, and, in spite of a series of little shrieks of ‘oh, oh,
oh!’ from poor alice, it swept her straight off the seat, and down among
the heap of rushes.

however, she wasn’t hurt, and was soon up again: the sheep went on with
her knitting all the while, just as if nothing had happened. ‘that was
a nice crab you caught!’ she remarked, as alice got back into her place,
very much relieved to find herself still in the boat.

‘was it? i didn’t see it,’ said alice, peeping cautiously over the side
of the boat into the dark water. ‘i wish it hadn’t let go--i should
so like to see a little crab to take home with me!’ but the sheep only
laughed scornfully, and went on with her knitting.

‘are t

here many crabs here?’ said alice.

‘crabs, and all sorts of things,’ said the sheep: ‘plenty of choice,
only make up your mind. now, what do you want to buy?’

‘to buy!’ alice echoed in a tone that was half astonished and half
frightened--for the oars, and the boat, and the river, had vanished all
in a moment, and she was back again in the little dark shop.

‘i should like to buy an egg, please,’ she said timidly. ‘how do you
sell them?’

‘fivepence farthing for one--twopence for two,’ the sheep replied.

‘then two are cheaper than one?’ alice said in a

 surprised tone, taking
out her purse.

‘only you must eat them both, if you buy two,’ said the sheep.

‘then i’ll have one, please,’ said alice, as she put the money down on
the counter. for she thought to herself, ‘they mightn’t be at all nice,
you know.’

the sheep took the money, and put it away in a box: then she said ‘i
never put things into people’s hands--that would never do--you must get
it for yourself.’ and so saying, she went off to the other end of the
shop, and set the egg upright on a shelf.

‘i wonder why it wouldn’t do?’ thought alice, as she groped her way
among the tables and chairs, for the shop was very dark towards the end.
‘the egg seems to get further away the more i walk towards it. let me
see, is this a chair? why, it
