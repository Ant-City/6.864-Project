cess unto our valiant general,
    and happiness to his accomplices!
  charles. what tidings send our scouts? i prithee speak.
  scout. the english army, that divided was
    into two parties, is now conjoin'd in one,
    and means to give you battle presently.
  charles. somewhat too sudden, sirs, the warning is;
    but we will presently provide for them.
  burgundy. i trust the ghost of talbot is not there.
    now he is gone, my lord, you need not fear.
  pucelle. of all base passions fear is most accurs'd.
    command the conquest, charles, it shall be thine,
    let henry fret and all the world repine.
  charles. then on, my lords; and france be fortunate!
