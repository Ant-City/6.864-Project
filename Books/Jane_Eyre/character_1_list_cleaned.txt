[CHARACTER] - 
 jane's employer and the master of thornfield, rochester
is a wealthy, passionate man with a dark secret that provides much
of the novel's suspense. rochester is unconventional, ready to set
aside polite manners, propriety, and consideration of social class
in order to interact with jane frankly and directly. he is rash
and impetuous and has spent much of his adult life roaming about
europe in an attempt to avoid the consequences of his youthful indiscretions.
his problems are partly the result of his own recklessness, but
he is a sympathetic figure because he has suffered for so long as
a result of his early marriage to bertha.
