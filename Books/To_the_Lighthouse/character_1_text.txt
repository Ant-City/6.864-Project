"yes, of course, if it's fine tomorrow," said mrs. ramsay. "but you'll
have to be up with the lark," she added.

to her son these words conveyed an extraordinary joy, as if it were
settled, the expedition were bound to take place, and the wonder to which
he had looked forward, for years and years it seemed, was, after a night's
darkness and a day's sail, within touch. since he belonged, even at the
age of six, to that great clan which cannot keep this feeling separate
from that, but must let future prospects, with their joys and sorrows,
cloud what is

 his mother, watching him guide his
scissors neatly round the refrigerator, imagined him all red and ermine on
the bench or directing a stern and momentous enterprise in some crisis of
public affairs.

"but," said his father, stopping in front of the drawing-room window, "it
won't be fine."

had there been an axe handy, a poker, or any weapon that would have gashed
a hole in his father's breast and killed him, there and then, james would
have seized it. such were the extremes of emotion that mr. ramsay excited
in his children's breasts by his mere presence; standing, as now, lean as
a knife, narrow as the blade of one, grinning sarcastically, not only with
the pleasure of disillusioning his son and casting ridicule upon his wife,
who was ten thousand times better in every way than he was
(james thought), but also with some secret conceit at his own accuracy of
judgement. what he said was true. it was always true. he was incapable
of untruth; never tampered with a fact; never altered a disagre

his own children, who, sprung from his loins, should be aware from
childhood that life is difficult; facts uncompromising; and the passage to
that fabled land where our brightest hopes are extinguished, our frail
barks founder in darkness (here mr. ramsay would straighten his back and
narrow his little blue eyes upon the horizon), one that needs, above all,
courage, truth, and the power to endure.

"but it may be fine--i expect it will be fine," said mrs. ramsay, making
some little twist of the reddish brown stocking she was knitting,
impatiently. if she finished it tonight, if they did go to the lighthouse
after all, it was to be given to the lighthouse keeper for his little boy,
who was threatened with a tuberculous hip; together with a pile o

how would you like that? she asked, addressing herself particularly to her
daughters. so she added, rather differently, one must take them whatever
comforts one can.

"it's due west," said the atheist tansley, holding his bony fingers spread
so that the wind blew through them, for he was sharing mr. ramsay's
evening walk up and down, up and down the terrace. that is to say, the
wind blew from the worst possible direction for landing at the lighthouse.
yes, he did say disagreeable things, mrs. ramsay admitted; it was odious
of him to rub this in, and make james still more disappointed; but at the
same time, she would not let them laugh at him. "the atheist," they
called him; "the little atheist." rose mocked him; prue mocked him;
andrew, jasper, roger mocked him; even old badger without a tooth in

nicer to be alone.

"nonsense," said mrs. ramsay, with great severity. apart from the habit
of exaggeration which they had from her, and from the implication (which
was true) that she asked too many people to stay, and had to lodge some in
the town, she could not bear incivility to her guests, to young men in
particular, who were poor as churchmice, "exceptionally able," her husband
said, his great admirers, and come there for a holiday. indeed, she had
the whole of the other sex under her protection; for reasons she could not

surely, he had said enough. she wished they would both leave her and
james alone and go on talking. she looked at him. he was such a
miserable specimen, the children said, all humps and hollows. he couldn't
play cricket; he poked; he shuffled. he was a sarcastic brute, andrew
said. they knew what he liked best--to be for ever walking up and down,
up and down, with mr. ramsay, and saying who had won this, who had won
that, who was a "first rate man" at latin verses, who was "brilliant but i
think fundamentally unsound," who was undoubtedly the "ablest fellow in
balliol," who had buried his light temporarily at bristol or bedford, but
was bound to be heard of later when his prolegomena, of which mr. tansley
had the first pages in proof with him if mr. ramsay would like to see
them, to some branch of mathematics or philosophy saw the light of day.

it was a fine evening so why not sit out of doors, then what they
complained of about charles tansley was that until he had turned the whole
thing round and made it somehow reflect himself and disparage them--he was
not satisfied. and he would go to picture galleries they said, and he
would ask one, did one like his tie? god knows, said rose, one did not.

disappearing as stealthily as stags from the dinner-table directly the
meal was over, the eight sons and daughters of mr. and mrs. ramsay sought
their bedrooms, their fastness in a house where there was no other privacy
to debate anything, everything; tansley's tie; the passing of the reform
bill; sea birds and butterflies; people; while the sun poured into those
attics, which a plank alone separated from each other so that every
footstep could be plainly heard and the swiss girl sobbing for her father
who was dying of cancer in a valley of the grisons, and lit up bats,
flannels, straw hats, ink-pots, paint-pots, beetles, and the

strife, divisions, difference of opinion, prejudices twisted into the very
fibre of being, oh, that they should begin so early, mrs. ramsay deplored.
they were so critical, her children. they talked such nonsense. she went
from the dining-room, holding james by the hand, since he would not go
with the others. it seemed to her such nonsense--inventing differences,
when people, heaven knows, were different enough without that. the real
differences, she thought, standing by the drawing-room window, are enough,
quite enough. she had in mind at the moment, rich and poor, high and low;

which embraced them all, without need of words, in a vast and benevolent
lethargy of well-wishing; all the house; all the world; all the people in
it, for he had slipped into his glass at lunch a few drops of something,
which accounted, the children thought, for the vivid streak of
canary-yellow in moustache and beard that were otherwise milk white. no,
nothing, he murmured.

he should have been a great philosopher, said mrs. ramsay, as they went
down the road to the fishing village, but he had made an unfortunate
marriage. holding her black parasol very erect, and moving with an
indescribable air of expectation, as if she were going to meet some one
round the corner, she told the story; an affair at oxford with some girl;
an early marriage; poverty; going to india; translating a little poetry
"very beautifully, i believe," being willing to teach the boys persian or

it flattered him; snubbed as he had been, it soothed him that mrs. ramsay
should tell him this. charles tansley revived. insinuating, too, as she
did the greatness of man's intellect, even in its decay, the subjection of
all wives--not that she blamed the girl, and the marriage had been happy
enough, she believed--to their husband's labours, she made him feel better
pleased with himself than he had done yet, and he would have liked, had

no. he could not say it right. he could not feel it right. but why not?
she wondered. what was wrong with him then? she liked him warmly, at the
moment. had they not been taken, she asked, to circuses when they were
children? never, he answered, as if she asked the very thing he wanted;
had been longing all these days to say, how they did not go to circuses.
it was a large family, nine brothers and sisters, and his father was a
working man. "my father is a chemist, mrs. ramsay. he keeps a shop." he
himself had paid his own way since he was thirteen. often he went without
a greatcoat in winter. he could never "return hospitality" (those were
his parched stiff words) at college. he had to make things last twice the
time other people did; he smoked the cheapest tobacco; shag; the same the
old men did in the quays. he worked hard--seven hours a day; his subject
was now the influence of something upon somebody--they were walking on and

glibly, but said to herself that she saw now why going to the circus had
knocked him off his perch, poor little man, and why he came out,
instantly, with all that about his father and mother and brothers and
sisters, and she would see to it that they didn't laugh at him any more;
she would tell prue about it. what he would have liked, she supposed,
would have been to say how he had gone not to the circus but to ibsen with
the ramsays. he was an awful prig--oh yes, an insufferable bore. for,
though they had reached the town now and were in the main street, with
carts grinding past on the cobbles, still he went on talking, about
settlements, and teaching, and working men, and helping our own class,
and lectures, till she gathered that he had got back entire
self-confidence, had recovered from the circus, and was about (and now
again she liked him warmly) to tell her--but here, the houses falling

spread before them and mrs. ramsay could not help exclaiming, "oh,
how beautiful!" for the great plateful of blue water was before her;
the hoary lighthouse, distant, austere, in the midst; and on the right,
as far as the eye could see, fading and falling, in soft low pleats,
the green sand dunes with the wild flowing grasses on them, which always
seemed to be running away into some moon country, uninhabited of men.

that was the view, she said, stopping, growing greyer-eyed, that her
husband loved.

mrs. ramsay to soften his voice into some semblance of geniality at least.

she said compassionately, smoothing the little boy's hair, for her

apprehensively to see if anyone had heard him. only lily briscoe, she was
glad to find; and that did not matter. but the sight of the girl standing
on the edge of the lawn painting reminded her; she was supposed to be
keeping her head as much in the same position as possible for lily's
picture. lily's picture! mrs. ramsay smiled. with her little chinese
eyes and her puckered-up face, she would never marry; one could not take
her painting very seriously; she was an independent little creature, and
mrs. ramsay liked her for it; so, remembering her promise, she bent her
head.

hands waving shouting out, "boldly we rode and well," but, mercifully, he

ever was anybody at once so ridiculous and so

safe; he would not stand still and look at her picture. and that was what
lily briscoe could not have endured. even while she looked at the mass,
at the line, at the colour, at mrs. ramsay sitting in the window with
james, she kept a feeler on her surroundings lest some one should creep
up, and suddenly she should find her picture looked at. but now, with all
her senses quickened as they were, looking, straining, till the colour of
the wall and the jacmanna beyond burnt into her eyes, she was aware of
someone coming out of the house, coming towards her; but somehow divined,

excellent, he observed. they allowed the toes their natural expansion.
lodging in the same house with her, he had noticed too, how orderly she
was, up before breakfast and off to paint, he believed, alone: poor,
presumably, and without the complexion or the allurement of miss doyle
certainly, but with a good sense which made her in his eyes superior to
that young lady. now, for instance, when ramsay bore down on them,
shouting, gesticulating, miss briscoe, he felt certain, understood.


some one had blundered.


mr. ramsay glared at them. he glared at them without seeming to see them.
that did make them both vaguely uncomfortable. together they had seen a
thing they had not been meant to see. they had encroached upon a privacy.
so, lily thought, it was probably an excuse of his for moving, for getting
out of earshot, that made mr. bankes almost immediately say something
about its being chi

 "but this is what i see; this is what i see," and so to clasp some
miserable remnant of her vision to her breast, which a thousand forces did
their best to pluck from her. and it was then too, in that chill and
windy way, as she began to paint, that there forced themselves upon her
other things, her own inadequacy, her insignificance, keeping house for
her father off the brompton road, and had much ado to control her impulse
to fling herself (thank heaven she had always resisted so far) at
mrs. ramsay's knee and say to her--but what could one say to her? "i'm in
love with you?" no, that was not true. "i'm in love with this all,"
waving her hand at the hedge, at the house, at the children. it was
absurd, it was impossible. so now she laid her brushes neatly in the box,
side by side, and said to william bankes:

"it suddenly gets cold. the sun seems to give less heat," she said,
looking about her, for it was bright enough, the grass still a soft deep
green, the house starred in its greenery wi

opped; shivered;
let its sails drop down; and then, with a natural instinct to complete the
picture, after this swift movement, both of them looked at the dunes
far away, and instead of merriment felt come over them some
sadness--because the thing was completed partly, and partly because
distant views seem to outlast by a million years (lily thought) the gazer
and to be communing already with a sky which beholds an earth entirely
at rest.

looking at the far sand hills, william bankes thought of ramsay: thought
of a road in westmorland, thought of ramsay striding along a road by
himself hung round with that solitude which seemed to be his natural air.
but this was suddenly interrupted, william bankes remembered (and this
must refer to some actual incident), by a hen, straddling her wings out in
protection of a covey of little chicks, upon which ramsay, stopping,
pointed his stick and said "pretty--pretty," an odd illumination in to
his heart, bankes had thought it, which showed his simplicity

, his
sympathy with humble things; but it seemed to him as if their friendship
had ceased, there, on that stretch of road. after that, ramsay had
married. after that, what with one thing and another, the pulp had gone
out of their friendship. whose fault it was he could not say, only, after
a time, repetition had taken the place of newness. it was to repeat that
they met. but in this dumb colloquy with the sand dunes he maintained
that his affection for ramsay had in no way diminished; but there, like
the body of a young man laid up in peat for a century, with the red fresh
on his lips, was his friendship, in its acuteness and reality, laid up
across the bay among the sandhills.

he was anxious for the sake of this friendship and perhaps too in order to
clear himself in his own mind from the imputation of having dried and
shrunk--for ramsay lived in a welter of children, whereas bankes was
childless and a widower--he was anxious that lily briscoe sho

uld not
disparage ramsay (a great man in his own way) yet should understand how
things stood between them. begun long years ago, their friendship had
petered out on a westmorland road, where the hen spread her wings before
her chicks; after which ramsay had married, and their paths lying
different ways, there had been, certainly for no one's fault, some
tendency, when they met, to repeat.

yes. that was it. he finished. he turned from the view. and, turning
to walk back the other way, up the drive, mr. bankes was alive to things
which would not have struck him had not those sandhills revealed to him
the body of his friendship lying with the red on its lips laid up in
peat--for instance, cam, the little girl, ramsay's youngest daughter. she

 picking sweet alice on the bank. she was wild and fierce. she would
not "give a flower to the gentleman" as the nursemaid told her.
no! no! no! she would not! she clenched her fist. she stamped. and
mr. bankes felt aged and saddened and somehow put into the wrong by her
about his friendship. he must have dried and shrunk.

the ramsays were not rich, and it was a wonder how they managed to
contrive it all. eight children! to feed eight children on philosophy!
here was another of them, jasper this time, strolling past, to have a shot
at a bird, he said, nonchalantly, swinging lily's hand like a pump-handle
as he passed, which caused mr. bankes to say, bitterly, how she was a
favourite. there was education now to be considered (true, mrs. ramsay
had something of her own perhaps) let alone the daily wear and tear of

ruthless youngsters, must require. as for being sure which was which, or
in what order they came, that was beyond him. he called them privately
after the kings and queens of england; cam the wicked, james the ruthless,
andrew the just, prue the fair--for prue would have beauty, he thought,
how could she help it?--and andrew brains. while he walked up the drive
and lily briscoe said yes and no and capped his comments (for she was in
love with them all, in love with this world) he weighed ramsay's case,
commiserated him, envied him, as if he had seen him divest himself of all
those glories of isolation and austerity which crowned him in youth to
cumber himself definitely with fluttering wings and clucking
domesticities. they gave him something--william bankes acknowledged that;
it would have been pleasant if cam had stuck a flower in his coat or
clambered over his shoulder, as over her father's, to look at a picture
of vesuvius in eruption; but they had also, his old friends could not

pend so much as he did upon people's praise.

"oh, but," said lily, "think of his work!"

whenever she "thought of his work" she always saw clearly before her a
large kitchen table. it was andrew's doing. she asked him what his
father's books were about. "subject and object and the nature of
reality," andrew had said. and when she said heavens, she had no notion
what that meant. "think of a kitchen table then," he told her, "when
you're not there."

so now she always saw, when she thought of mr. ramsay's work, a scrubbed
kitchen table. it lodged now in the fork of a pear tree, for they had
reached the orchard. and with a painful effort of concentration, she
focused her mind, not upon the silver-bossed bark of the tree, or upon its
fish-shaped leaves, but upon a phantom kitchen table, one of those
scrubbed board tables, grained and knotted, whose virtue seems to have
been laid bare by years of muscular integrity, which stuck there, its four
legs in air. naturally, if one's days were passed in

impressions of him tilted up, and down poured in a ponderous avalanche all

live for science (involuntarily, sections of potatoes rose before her
eyes); praise would be an insult to you; generous, pure-hearted, heroic

the way up here; objected to dogs on chairs; would prose for hours (until
mr. ramsay slammed out of the room) about salt in vegetables a

all? standing now, apparently transfixed, by the pear tree, impressions
poured in upon her of those two men, and to follow her thought was like
following a voice which speaks too quickly to be taken down by one's
pencil, and the voice was her own voice saying without prompting
undeniable, everlasting, contradictory things, so that even the
fissures and humps on the bark of the pear tree were irrevocably
fixed there for eternity. you have greatness, she continued, but
mr. ramsay has none of it. he is petty, selfish, vain, egotistical; he is
spoilt; he is a tyrant; he wears mrs. ramsay to death; but he has what you
(she addressed mr. bankes) have not; a fiery unworldliness; he knows
nothing about trifles; he loves dogs and his children. he has eight.
mr. bankes has none. did he not come down in two coats the other night
and let mrs. ramsay trim his hair into a pudding basin? all of this
danced up and down, like a company of gnats, each separate but all

rolled in an invisible elastic net--danced up and down in
lily's mind, in and about the branches of the pear tree, where still hung
in effigy the scrubbed kitchen table, symbol of her profound respect for
mr. ramsay's mind, until her thought which had spun quicker and quicker
exploded of its own intensity; she felt released; a shot went off close at
hand, and there came, flying from its fragments, frightened, effusive,
tumultuous, a flock of starlings.

"jasper!" said mr. bankes. they turned the way the starlings flew, over
the terrace. following the scatter of swift-flying birds in the sky they
stepped through the gap in the high hedge straight into mr. ramsay, who
boomed tragically at them, "some one had

something of this delicious emotion, this impure rhapsody of which he was
ashamed, but in which he revelled--he turned abruptly, slammed his private
door on them; and, lily briscoe and mr. bankes, looking uneasily up into
the sky, observed that the flock of starlings which jasper had routed with
his gun had settled on the tops of the elm trees.

"and even if it isn't fine tomorrow," said mrs. ramsay, raising her eyes
to glance at william bankes and lily briscoe as they passed, "it will be
another day. and now," she said, thinking that lily's charm was her
chinese eyes, aslant in her white, puckered little face, but it would take
a clever man to see it, "and now stand up, and let me measure your leg,"
for they might go to the lighthouse after all, and she must see if the
stocking did not need to be an inch or two longer in the leg.

should be open, and doors shut--simple as it was, could none of them
remember it? she would go into the maids' bedrooms at night and find
them sealed like ovens, except for marie's, the swiss girl, who
would rather go without a bath than without fresh air, but then
at home, she had said, "the mountains are so beautiful." she had said
that last night looking out of the window with tears in her eyes.
"the mountains are so beautiful." her father was dying there,
mrs. ramsay knew. he was leaving them fatherless. scolding and
demonstrating (how to make a bed, how to open a window, with hands that
shut and spread like a frenchwoman's) all had folded itself quietly about
her, when the girl spoke, as, after a flight through the sunshine the
wings of a bird fold themselves quietly and the blue of its plumage
changes from bright steel to soft purple. she had stood there silent for
there was nothing to be said. he had cancer of the throat. at the

telephoning to a woman like that. the graces assembling seemed to have
joined hands in meadows of asphodel to compose that face. yes, he would
catch the 10:30 at euston.

"but she's no more aware of her beauty than a child," said mr. bankes,
replacing the receiver and crossing the room to see what progress the
workmen were making with an hotel which they were building at the back of
his house. and he thought of mrs. ramsay as he looked at that stir among
the unfinished walls. for always, he thought, there was something
incongruous to be worked into the harmony of her face. she clapped a
deer-stalker's hat on her head; she ran across the lawn in galoshes to
snatch a child from mischief. so that if it was her beauty merely that
one thought of, one must remember the quivering thing, the living thing
(they were carrying bricks up a little plank as he watched them), and work
it into the picture; or if one thought of h

suppose some latent desire to doff her royalty of form as if her beauty
bored her and all that men say of beauty, and she wanted only to be like
other people, insignificant. he did not know. he did not know. he must
go to his work.)

knitting her reddish-brown hairy stocking, with her head outlined absurdly
by the gilt frame, the green shawl which she had tossed over the edge of
the frame, and the authenticated masterpiece by michael angelo,
mrs. ramsay smoothed out what had been harsh in her manner a moment
before, raised his head, and kissed her little boy on the forehead.
"let us find another picture to cut out," she said.

but what had happened?

some one had blundered.

starting from her musing she gave meaning to words which she had held
meaningless in her mind for a long stretch of time. "some one had

bearing down upon her, she gazed steadily until his closenes

manner peculiar to him, compound of severity and humour, he teased his
youngest son's bare leg.

the extraordinary irrationality of her remark, the folly of women's minds
enraged him. he had ridden through the valley of death, been shattered
and shivered; and now, she flew in the face of facts, made his children

security opened before her. there was nobody she reverenced more. she
was not good enough to tie his shoe strings, she felt.

already ashamed of that petulance, of that gesticulation of the hands when
charging at the head of his troops, mr. ramsay rather sheepishly prodded
his son's bare legs once more, and then, as if he had her leave for it,
with a movement which oddly reminded his wife of the great sea lion at the
zoo tumbling backwards after swallowing his fish and walloping off so that
the water in the tank washes from side to side, he dived into the evening
air which, already thinner, was taking the substance from leaves and
hedges but, as if in return, restoring to roses and pinks a lustre which
they had not had by day.

terrace.

but how extraordinarily his note had changed! it was like the cuckoo;
"in june he gets out of tune"; as if he were trying over, tentatively
seeking, some phrase for a new mood, and having only this at hand, used
it, cracked though it was. but it sounded ridiculous--"some one had
blundered"--said like that, almost as a question, without any conviction,
melodiously. mrs. ramsay could not help smiling, and soon, sure enough,
walking up and down, he hummed it, dropped it, fell silent.

he was safe, he was restored to his privacy. he stopped to light his
pipe, looked once at his wife and son in the window, and as one raises
one's eyes from a page in an express train and sees a farm, a tree, a
cluster of cottages as an illustration, a confirmation of something on the
printed page to which one returns, fortified, and satisfied, so without
his distinguishing either his son

without treachery to the expedition behind him, "one perhaps." one in a
generation. is he to be blamed then if he is not that one? provided he
has toiled honestly, given to the best of his power, and till he has no
more left to give? and his fame lasts how long? it is permissible even
for a dying hero to think before he dies how men will speak of him
hereafter. his fame lasts perhaps two thousand years. and what are two
thousand years? (asked mr. ramsay ironically, staring at the hedge).

ages? the very stone one kicks with one's boot will outlast shakespeare.

and would then be merged in some bigger light, and that in a bigger still.

if before death stiffens his limbs beyond the power of movement he does a
little consciously raise his numbed fingers to his brow, and square his
shoulders, so that when the search party comes they will find him dead at
his post, the fine figure of a soldier? mr. ramsay squared his shoulders
and stood very upright by the urn.

who shall blame him, if, so standing for a moment he dwells upon fame,
upon search parties, upon cairns raised by grateful followers over his
bones? finally, who shall blame the leader of the doomed expedition, if,

them to attend to him) but most of all he hated the twang and twitter of
his father's emotion which, vibrating round them, disturbed the perfect

fixedly at the page, he hoped to make him move on; by pointing his finger
at a word, he hoped to recall his mother's attention, which, he knew
angrily, wavered instantly his father stopped. but, no. nothing would
make mr. ramsay move on. there he stood, demanding sympathy.

mrs. ramsay, who had been sitting loosely, folding her son in her arm,
braced herself, and, half turning, seemed to raise herself with an effort,
and at once to pour erect into the air a rain of energy, a column of
spray, looking at the same time animated and alive as if all her energies
were being fused into force, burning and illuminating (quietly though she
sat, taking up her stocking again), and into this delicious fecundity,

must have more than that. it was sympathy he wanted, to be assured of his

that iniquity of his wife's towards him, which had made her turn to steel
and adamant there, in the horrible little room in st john's wood, when
with her own eyes she had seen that odious woman turn him out of the
house. he was unkempt; he dropped things on his coat; he had the
tiresomeness of an old man with nothing in the world to do; and she turned
him out of the room. she said, in her odious way, "now, mrs. ramsay and i
want to have a little talk together," and mrs. ramsay could see, as if
before her eyes, the innumerable miseries of his life. had he money
enough to buy tobacco? did he have to ask her for it? half a crown?
eighteenpence? oh, she could not bear to think of the little indignities
she made him suffer. and always now (why, she could not guess, except
that it came probably from that woman somehow) he shrank from her. he
never told her anything. but what more could she have done? there was a

what she minded, coming as it did on top of her discontent with her
husband; the sense she had now when mr. carmichael shuffled past, just
nodding to her question, with a book beneath his arm, in his yellow
slippers, that she was suspected; and that all this desire of hers to
give, to help, was vanity. for her own self-satisfaction was it that she
wished so instinctively to help, to give, that people might say of her,
"o mrs. ramsay! dear mrs. ramsay ... mrs. ramsay, of course!" and need her
and send for her and admire her? was it not secretly this that she
wanted, and therefore when mr. carmichael shrank away from her, as he did
at this moment, making off to some corner where he did acrostics
endlessly, she did not feel merely snubbed back in her instinct, but made
aware of the pettiness of some part of her, and of human relations, how
flawed they are, how despicable, how self-seeking, at their best. shabby

mrs. ramsay could have wished that her husband had not chosen that moment
to stop. why had he not gone as he said to watch the children playing
cricket? but he did not speak; he looked; he nodded; he approved; he went
on. he slipped, seeing before him that hedge which had over and over
again rounded some pause, signified some conclusion, seeing his wife and
child, seeing again the urns with the trailing of red geraniums which had
so often decorated processes of thought, and bore, written up among their

how strangely he was venerable and laughable at one and the same time.

teaching and preaching is beyond human power, lily suspected. (she was
putting away her things.) if you are exalted you must somehow come a
cropper. mrs. ramsay gave him what he asked too easily. then the change
must be so upsetting, lily said. he comes in from his books and finds us
all playing games and talking nonsense. imagine what a change from the
things he thinks about, she said.

lily briscoe; he could discuss ramsay with her quite openly.) it was for
that reason, he said, that the young don't read carlyle. a crusty old
grumbler who lost his temper if the porridge was cold, why should he
preach to us? was what mr. bankes understood that young people said
nowadays. it was a thousand pities if you thought, as he did, that
carlyle was one of the great teachers of mankind. lily was ashamed to say
that she had not read carlyle since she was at school. but in her opinion

for who could be deceived by him? he asked you quite openly to flatter
him, to admire him, his little dodges deceived nobody. what she disliked
was his narrowness, his blindness, she said, looking after him.

"a bit of a hypocrite?" mr. bankes suggested, looking too at mr. ramsay's
back, for was he not thinking of his friendship, and of cam refusing to
give him a flower, and of all those boys and girls, and his own house,
full of comfort, but, since his wife's death, quiet rather? of course,
he had his work... all the same, he rather wished lily to agree that
ramsay was, as he said, "a bit of a hypocrite."

lily briscoe went on putting away her brushes, looking up, looking down.

no--the most sincere of men, the truest (here he was), the best; but,
looking down, she thought, he is absorbed in himself, he is tyrannical,
he is unjust; and kept looking down, purposely, for only so could she keep
steady, staying with the ramsays. directly one looked up and saw them,
what she called "being in love" flooded them. they became part of that
unreal but penetrating and exciting universe which is the world seen
through the eyes of love. the sky stuck to them; the birds sang through
them. and, what was even more exciting, she felt, too, as she saw mr.
ramsay bearing down and retreating, and mrs. ramsay sitting with james in
the window and the cloud moving and the tree bending, how life, from being
made up of little separate in

mr. bankes expected her to answer. and she was about to say something
criticizing mrs. ramsay, how she was alarming, too, in her way,
high-handed, or words to that effect, when mr. bankes made it entirely
unnecessary for her to speak by his rapture. for such it was considering
his age, turned sixty, and his cleanliness and his impersonality, and the
white scientific coat which seemed to clothe him. for him to gaze as lily
saw him gazing at mrs. ramsay was a rapture, equivalent, lily felt, to the
loves of dozens of young men (and perhaps mrs. ramsay had never excited the
loves of dozens

y the sight of her reading a fairy tale to her boy had upon him
precisely the same effect as the solution of a scientific problem, so that
he rested in contemplation of it, and felt, as he felt when he had proved
something absolute about the digestive system of plants, that barbarity
was tamed, the reign of chaos subdued.

such a rapture--for by what other name could one call it?--made lily
briscoe forget entirely what she had been about to say. it was nothing of
importance; something about mrs. ramsay. it paled beside this "rapture,"
this silent stare, for which she felt intense gratitude; for nothing so
solaced her, eased her of the perplexity of life, and miraculously raised
its burdens, as this sublime power, this heavenly gift, and one would no
more disturb it, while it lasted, than break up the shaft of sunlight,
lying level across the floor.

that people should love like this, that mr. bankes should feel this for
mrs. ramsey (she glanced at him musing) was helpful, was exalting. she

have seen it. but then she did not see it like that. she saw the colour
burning on a framework of steel; the light of a butterfly's wing lying
upon the arches of a cathedral. of all that only a few random marks
scrawled upon the canvas remained. and it would never be seen; never be
hung even, and there was mr. tansley whispering in her ear, "women can't
paint, women can't write ..."

she now remembered what she had been going to say about mrs. ramsay. she
did not know how she would have put it; but it would have been something
critical. she had been annoyed the other night by some highhandedness.
looking along the level of mr. bankes's glance at her, she thought that no
woman could worship another woman in the way he worshipped; they could
only seek shelter under the shade which mr. bankes extended over them both.
looking along his beam she added to it her different ray, thinking that

crumpled glove in the corner of a sofa, you would have known it, from its
twisted finger, hers indisputably? she was like a bird for speed, an
arrow for directness. she was willful; she was commanding (of course,
lily reminded herself, i am thinking of her relations with women, and i am
much younger, an insignificant person, living off the brompton road). she
opened bedroom windows. she shut doors. (so she tried to start the tune
of mrs. ramsay in her head.) arriving late at night, with a light tap on
one's bedroom door, wrapped in an old fur coat (for the setting of her
beauty was always that--hasty, but apt), she would enact again whatever it
might be--charles tansley losing his umbrella; mr. carmichael snuffling and
sniffing; mr. bankes saying, "the vegetable salts are lost." all this she
would adroitly shape; even maliciously twist; and, moving over to the
window, in pretence that she must go,--it was dawn, she could see the sun

insist that she must, minta must, they all must marry, since in the whole

had her share of those), and here she saddened, darkened, and came back to
her chair, there could be no disputing this: an unmarried woman (she
lightly took her hand for a moment), an unmarried woman has missed the
best of life. the house seemed full of children sleeping and mrs. ramsay
listening; shaded lights and regular breathing.

dared to say it, her painting. but all this seemed so little, so
virginal, against the

other. yet, as the night wore on, and white lights
parted the curtains, and even now and then some bird chirped in the
garden, gathering a desperate courage she would urge her own exemption
from the universal law; plead for it; she liked to be alone; she liked to
be herself; she was not made for that; and so have to meet a serious stare
from eyes of unparalleled depth, and confront mrs. ramsay's simple
certainty (and she was childlike now) that her dear lily, her little
brisk, was a fool. then, she remembered, she had laid her head on mrs.
ramsay's lap and laughed and laughed and laughed, laughed almost
hysterically at the thought of mrs. ramsay presiding with immutable calm
over destinies which she completely failed to understand. there she sat,
simple, serious. she had recovered her sense of her now--this was the
glove's twisted finger. but into what sanctuary had one penetrated?

sleeps beside the moon.

to think that mrs. ramsay would never know the reason of that pressure, she
imagined how in the chambers of the mind and heart of the woman who was,
physically, touching her, were stood, like the treasures in the tombs of
kings, tablets bearing sacred inscriptions, which if one could spell them
out, would teach one everything, but they would never be offered openly,
never made public. what art was there, known to love or cunning, by which
one pressed through into those secret chambers? what device for becoming,

ers poured into one jar, inextricably the same, one with the
object one adored? could the body achieve, or the mind, subtly mingling
in the intricate passages of the brain? or the heart? could loving,
as people called it, make her and mrs. ramsay one? for it was not knowledge
but unity that she desired, not inscriptions on tablets, nothing that
could be written in any language known to men, but intimacy itself, which
is knowledge, she had thought, leaning her head on mrs. ramsay's knee.

nothing happened. nothing! nothing! as she leant her head against
mrs. ramsay's knee. and yet, she knew knowledge and wisdom were stored up
in mrs. ramsay's heart. how, then, she had asked herself, did one know one
thing or another thing about people, sealed as they were? only like a
bee, drawn by some sweetness or sharpness in the air intangible to touch
or taste, one haunted the dome-shaped hive, ranged the wastes of the air
over the countries of the world alone, and then haunted the

mrs. ramsay rose. lily rose. mrs. ramsay went. for days there hung about
her, as after a dream some subtle change is felt in the person one has
dreamt of, more vividly than anything she said, the sound of murmuring
and, as she sat in the wicker arm-chair in the drawing-room window she
wore, to lily's eyes, an august shape; the shape of a dome.

this ray passed level with mr. bankes's ray straight to mrs. ramsay sitting
reading there with james at her knee. but now while she still looked,
mr. bankes had done. he had put on his spectacles. he had stepped back.
he had raised his hand. he had slightly narrowed his clear blue eyes,
when lily, rousing herself, saw what he was at, and winced like a dog who
sees a hand raised to strike it. she would have snatched her picture off
the easel, but she said to herself, one must. she braced herself to stand
the awful trial of some one looking at her picture. one mu

thirty-three years, the deposit of each day's living mixed with something
more secret than she had ever spoken or shown in the course of all those
days was an agony. at the same time it was immensely exciting.

nothing could be cooler and quieter. taking out a pen-knife, mr. bankes
tapped the canvas with the bone handle. what did she wish to indicate by
the triangular purple shape, "just there"? he asked.

it was mrs. ramsay reading to james, she said. she knew his objection--
that no one could tell it for a human shape. but she had made no attempt
at likeness, she said. for what reason had she introduced them then? he
asked. why indeed?--except that if there, in that corner, it was bright,
here, in this, she felt the need of darkness. simple, obvious,
commonplace, as it was, mr. bankes was interested. mother and child

how to connect this mass on the right hand with that on the left. she
might do it by bringing the line of the branch across so; or break the
vacancy in the foreground by an object (james perhaps) so. but the danger
was that by doing that the unity of the whole might be broken. she
stopped; she did not want to bore him; she took the canvas lightly off the
easel.

but it had been seen; it had been taken from her. this man had shared
with her something profoundly intimate. and, thanking mr. ramsay for it
and mrs. ramsay for it and the hour and the place, crediting the world with
a power which she had not suspected--that one could walk away down that
long gallery not alone any more but arm in arm with somebody--the
strangest feeling in the world, and the most exhilarating--she nicked
the catch of her paint-box to, more firmly than was necessary, and the
nick seemed to surround in a circle forever the paint-box, the lawn,
mr. bankes, and that wild villain, cam, dashing past.

and lily briscoe; though mr. bankes, who would have liked a daughter of
his own, held out his hand; she would not stop for her father, whom she
grazed also by an inch; nor for her mother, who called "cam! i want
you a moment!" as she dashed past. she was off like a bird, bullet, or
arrow, impelled by what desire, shot by whom, at what directed, who
could say? what, what? mrs. ramsay pondered, watching her. it might
be a vision--of a shell, of a wheelbarrow, of a fairy kingdom on the
far side of the hedge; or it might be the glory of speed; no one knew.
but when mrs. ramsay called "cam!" a second time, the projectile dropped
in mid career, and cam came lagging back, pulling a leaf by the way, to
her mother.

what was she dreaming about, mrs. ramsay wondered, seeing her engrossed,
as she stood there, with some thought of her own, so that she had to
repeat the message twice--

where, if the waters were clear, they were also so extraordinarily
distorting that, even as they descended, one saw them twisting about to
make heaven knows what pattern on the floor of the child's mind. what
message would cam give the cook? mrs. ramsay wondered. and indeed it
was only by waiting patiently, and hearing that there was an old woman in
the kitchen with very red cheeks, drinking soup out of a basin, that
mrs. ramsay at last prompted that parrot-like instinct which had picked up
mildred's words quite accurately and could now produce them, if one
waited, in a colourless singsong. shifting from foot to foot, cam
repeated the words, "no, they haven't, and i've told ellen to clear away

ck then. that could only
mean, mrs. ramsay thought, one thing. she must accept him, or she must
refuse him. this going off after luncheon for a walk, even though
andrew was with them--what could it mean? except that she had decided,
rightly, mrs. ramsay thought (and she was very, very fond of minta), to
accept that good fellow, who might not be brilliant, but then, thought
mrs. ramsay, realising that james was tugging at her, to make her go on
reading aloud the fisherman and his wife, she did in her own heart
infinitely prefer boobies to clever men who wrote dissertations;
charles tansley, for instance. anyhow it must have happened, one way
or the other, by now.

but she read, "next morning the wife awoke first, and it was just
daybreak, and from her bed she saw the beautiful country lying before
her. her husband was still stretching himself..."

but how could minta say now

certain, looking from one to the other in her mind's eye.

she read on: "ah, wife," said the man, "why should we be king? i do
not want to be king." "well," said the wife, "if you won't be king, i
will; go to the flounder, for i will be king."

"come in or go out, cam," she said, knowing that cam was attracted only
by the word "flounder" and that in a moment she would fidget and fight
with james as usual. cam shot off. mrs. ramsay went on reading,
relieved, for she and james shared the same tastes and were comfortable
together.

"and when he came to the sea, it was quite dark grey, and the water heaved
up from below, and smelt putrid. then he went and stood by it and said,


'flounder, flounder, in the sea,

'well, what does she want then?' said the flounder." and where were

mind as she read. the owl and the poker--yes, they would be annoyed if
they heard--and they were certain to hear--that minta, staying with the
ramsays, had been seen etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. "he wore a wig in
the house of commons and she ably assisted him at the head of the
stairs," she repeated, fishing them up out of her mind by a phrase
which, coming back from some party, she had made to amuse her husband.
dear, dear, mrs. ramsay said to herself, how did they produce this
incongruous daughter? this tomboy minta, with a hole in her stocking?
how did she exist in that portentous atmosphere where the maid was
always removing in a dust-pan the sand that the parrot had scattered,
and conversation was almost entirely reduced to the exploits--interesting
perhaps, but limited after all--of that bird? naturally, one had asked
her to lunch, tea, dinner, finally to stay with them up at finlay, which
had resulted in some friction w

and more conversation, and more sand, and really at the end of it, she had
told enough lies about parrots to last her a lifetime (so she had said
to her husband that night, coming back from the party). however,
minta came...yes, she came, mrs. ramsay thought, suspecting some thorn
in the tangle of this thought; and disengaging it found it to be this: a
woman had once accused her of "robbing her of her daughter's affections";
something mrs. doyle had said made her remember that charge again. wishing
to dominate, wishing to interfere, making people do what she wished--that
was the charge against her, and she thought it most unjust. how could
she help being "like that" to look at? no one could accuse her of
taking pains to impress. she was oft

not help noting, as he passed, the sternness at the heart of
her beauty. it saddened him, and her remoteness pained him, and he
felt, as he passed, that he could not protect her, and, when he reached
the hedge, he was sad. he could do nothing to help her. he must stand
by and watch her. indeed, the infernal truth was, he made things worse
for her. he was irritable--he was touchy. he had lost his temper over
the lighthouse. he looked into the hedge, into its intricacy, its
darkness.

always, mrs. ramsay felt, one helped oneself out of solitude reluctantly
by laying hold of some little odd or end, some sound, some sight. she
listened, but it was all very still; cricket was over; the children
were in their baths; there was only the sound of the sea. she stopped
knitting; she held the long reddish-brown stocking dangling in her
hands a moment. she saw the light again. with some irony in her
interrogation, for when one woke at all, one's relations changed, she
looked at the steady light, the pitil

d he said, at once, soothing her instantly, that it
was natural in a boy, and he trusted he would find better ways of
amusing himself before long. her husband was so sensible, so just.
and so she said, "yes; all children go through stages," and began
considering the dahlias in the big bed, and wondering what about next
year's flowers, and had he heard the children's nickname for charles
tansley, she asked. the atheist, they called him, the little atheist.
"he's not a polished specimen," said mr. ramsay. "far from it," said
mrs. ramsay.

ramsay said, wondering whether it was any use sending down bulbs; did
they plant them? "oh, he has his dissertation to write," said mr.

nothing else. it was about the influence of somebody upon something.

about to say that anyhow he was the only young man in england who
admired his--when he choked it back. he would not bother her again
about his books. these flowers seemed creditable, mr. ramsay said,
lowering his gaze and noticing something red, something brown. yes, but
then these she had put in with her own hands, said mrs. ramsay. the

ramsay. he saw no trace of it, said mr. ramsay. "well, then, look
tonight," said mrs. ramsay. they paused. he wished andrew could be
induced to work harder. he would lose every chance of a scholarship if
he didn't. "oh, scholarships!" she said. mr. ramsay thought her foolish
for saying that, about a serious thing, like a scholarship. he should
be very proud of andrew if he got a scholarship, he said. she would be
just as proud of him if he didn't, she answered. they disagreed always
about this, but it did not matter. she liked him to believe in
scholarships, and he liked her to be prou

there was the lighthouse again, but she would not let herself look at
it. had she known that he was looking at her, she thought, she would
not have let herself sit there, thinking. she disliked anything that
reminded her that she had been seen sitting thinking. so she looked
over her shoulder, at the town. the lights were rippling and running
as if they were drops of silver water held firm in a wind. and all the
poverty, all the suffering had turned to that, mrs. ramsay thought. the
lights of the town and of the harbour and of the boats seemed like a
phantom net floating there to mark something which had sunk. well, if
he could not share her thoughts, mr. ramsay said to himself, he would be
off, then, on his own. he wanted to go on thinking, telling himself the
story how hume was stuck in a bog; he wanted to laugh. but first it
was nonsense to be anxious about andrew. when he was andrew's age he
used to walk about the country all day long, with nothing but a b

he was not complaining, he said. she knew that he did not complain.
she knew that he had nothing whatever to complain of. and he seized
her hand and raised it to his lips and kissed it with an intensity that
brought the tears to her eyes, and quickly he dropped it.

they turned away from the view and began to walk up the path where the
silver-green spear-like plants grew, arm in arm. his arm was almost
like a young man's arm, mrs. ramsay thought, thin and hard, and she
thought with delight how strong he still was, though he was over sixty,
and how untamed and optimistic, and how strange it was that being
convinced, as he was, of all sorts of horrors, seemed not to depress
him, but to cheer him. was it not odd, she reflected? indeed he
seemed to her sometimes made differently from other people, born blind,
deaf, and dumb, to the ordinary things, but to the extraordinary
things, with an eye like an eagle's. his understanding ofte

view? no. did he even notice his own daughter's beauty, or whether
there was pudding on his plate or roast beef? he would sit at table
with them like a person in a dream. and his habit of talking aloud, or
saying poetry aloud, was growing on him, she was afraid; for sometimes
it was awkward--

poor miss giddings, when he shouted that at her, almost jumped out of
her skin. but then, mrs. ramsay, though instantly taking his side
against all the silly giddingses in the world, then, she thought,
intimating by a little pressure on his arm that he walked up hill too
fast for her, and she must stop for a moment to see whether those were
fresh molehills on the bank, then, she thought, stooping down to look,
a great mind like his must be different in every way from ours. all
the great men she had ever known, she thought, deciding that a rabbit
must have got in, were like that, and it was good

not want compliments (most men do, she thought), and she was a little
ashamed of her impulse and said nothing while he remarked that perhaps
what he was saying did not apply to pictures. anyhow, said lily,
tossing off her little insincerity, she would always go on painting,
because it interested her. yes, said mr. bankes, he was sure she would,
and, as they reached the end of the lawn he was asking her whether she
had difficulty in finding subjects in london when they turned and saw
the ramsays. so that is marriage, lily thought, a man and a woman
looking at a girl throwing a ball. that is what mrs. ramsay tried to
tell me the other night, she thought. for she was wearing a green
shawl, and they were standing close together watching prue and
jasper throwing catches. and suddenly the meaning which, for no
reason at all, as perhaps they are stepping out of the tube or
ringing a doorbell, descends on people, making them symbolical,
making them representative, came upon them, and made th

standing, looking, the symbols of marriage, husband and wife. then,
after an instant, the symbolical outline which transcended the real
figures sank down again, and they became, as they met them, mr. and mrs.
ramsay watching the children throwing catches. but still for a moment,
though mrs. ramsay greeted them with her usual smile (oh, she's thinking
we're going to get married, lily thought) and said, "i have triumphed
tonight," meaning that for once mr. bankes had agreed to dine with them
and not run off to his own lodging where his man cooked vegetables
properly; still, for one moment, there was a sense of things having
been blown apart, of space, of irresponsibility as the ball soared
high, and they followed it and lost it and saw the one star and the
draped branches. in the failing l

ight they all looked sharp-edged and
ethereal and divided by great distances. then, darting backwards over
the vast space (for it seemed as if solidity had vanished altogether),
prue ran full tilt into them and caught the ball brilliantly high up in
her left hand, and her mother said, "haven't they come back yet?"
whereupon the spell was broken. mr. ramsay felt free now to laugh out
loud at the thought that hume had stuck in a bog and an old woman
rescued him on condition he said the lord's prayer, and chuckling to
himself he strolled off to his study. mrs. ramsay, bringing prue back
into throwing catches again, from which she had escaped, asked,

with her dumb look, holding out her hand, as nancy made off, after
lunch, to her attic, to escape the

, the lights coming out suddenly one by one seemed
like things that were going to happen to him--his marriage, his
children, his house; and again he thought, as they came out on to the
high road, which was shaded with high bushes, how they would retreat
into solitude together, and walk on and on, he always leading her, and
she pressing close to his side (as she did now). as they turned by the
cross roads he thought what an appalling experience he had been
through, and he must tell some one--mrs. ramsay of course, for it took
his breath away to think what he had been and done. it had been far
and away the worst moment of his life when he asked minta to marry him.
he would go straight to mrs. ramsay, because he felt somehow that she
was the person who had made him do it. she had made him think he could
do anything. nobody else took him seriously. but she made him believe
that he could do whatever he wanted. he had felt her eyes on him all
day today, following him about (though she never said a

word) as if she
were saying, "yes, you can do it. i believe in you. i expect it of
you." she had made him feel all that, and directly they got back (he
looked for the lights of the house above the bay) he would go to her
and say, "i've done it, mrs. ramsay; thanks to you." and so turning into
the lane that led to the house he could see lights moving about in the
upper windows. they must be awfully late then. people were getting
ready for dinner. the house was all lit up, and the lights after the
darkness made his eyes feel full, and he said to himself, childishly,
as he walked up the drive, lights, lights, lights, and repeated in a
dazed way, lights, lights, lights, as they came into the house staring
about him with his face quite stiff. but, goo

"yes," said prue, in her considering way, answering her mother's
question, "i think nancy did go with them."


16


well then, nancy had gone with them, mrs. ramsay supposed, wondering, as
she put down a brush, took up a comb, and said "come in" to a tap at
the door (jasper and rose came in), whether the fact that nancy was
with them made it less likely or more likely that anything would
happen; it made it less likely, somehow, mrs. ramsay felt, very
irrationally, except that after all holocaust on such a scale was not
probable. they could not all be drowned. and again she felt alone in
the presence of her old antagonist, life.

jasper and rose said that m

ildred wanted to know whether she should
wait dinner.

"not for the queen of england," said mrs. ramsay emphatically.

"not for the empress of mexico," she added, laughing at jasper; for he
shared his mother's vice: he, too, exaggerated.

and if rose liked, she said, while jasper took the message, she might
choose which jewels she was to wear. when there are fifteen people
sitting down to dinner, one cannot keep things waiting for ever. she
was now beginning to feel annoyed with them for being so late; it was
inconsiderate of them, and it annoyed her on top of her anxiety about
them, that they sh

thing depended upon things
being served up to the precise moment they were ready. the beef, the
bayleaf, and the wine--all must be done to a turn. to keep it waiting
was out of the question. yet of course tonight, of all nights, out
they went, and they came in late, and things had to be sent out,
things had to be kept hot; the boeuf en daube would be entirely spoilt.

jasper offered her an opal necklace; rose a gold necklace. which
looked best against her black dress? which did indeed, said mrs. ramsay
absent-mindedly, looking at her neck and shoulders (but avoiding her
face) in the glass. and then, while the children rummaged among her
things, she looked out of the window at a sight which always amused
her--the rooks trying to decide which tree to settle on. every time,
they seemed to change their minds and rose up into the air again,
because, she thought, the old rook, the father rook, old joseph was her
name for him, was a bird of a very trying and difficult disposition.

amethysts?

"choose, dearests, choose," she said, hoping that they would make
haste.

but she let them take their time to choose: she let rose, particularly,
take up this and then that, and hold her jewels against the black
dress, for this little ceremony of choosing jewels, which was gone
through every night, was what rose liked best, she knew. she had some
hidden reason of her own for attaching great importance to this
choosing what her mother was to wear. what was the reason, mrs. ramsay
wondered, standing still to let her clasp the necklace she had chosen,
divining, through her own past, some deep, some buried, some quite
speechless feeling that one had for one's mother at rose's age. like
all feelings felt for oneself, mrs. ramsay thought, it made one sad. it
was so inadequate, what one could give in return; and what rose felt
was quite out of proportion to anything she actually was. and rose
would grow up; and rose would suffer, she supposed, with these deep
feelings, and sh

great clangour of the gong announced solemnly, authoritatively, that

their own, reading, writing, putting the last smooth to their hair, or
fastening dresses, must leave all that, and the little odds and ends on
their washing-tables and dressing tables, and the novels on the bed-
tables, and the diaries which were so private, and assemble in the

but what have i done with my life? thought mrs. ramsay, taking her
place at the head of the table, and looking at all the plates making
white circles on it. "william, sit by me," she said. "lily," she
said, wearily, "over there." they had that--paul rayley and minta
doyle--she, only this--an infinitely long table and plates and knives.
at the far end was her husband, sitting down, all in a heap, frowning.
what at? she did not know. she did not mind. she could not
understand how she had ever felt any emotion or affection for him. she
had a sense of

spoon precisely in the middle of his plate, which he had swept clean,
as if, lily thought (he sat opposite to her with his back to the window
precisely in the middle of view), he were determined to make sure of
his meals. everything about him had that meagre fixity, that bare
unloveliness. but nevertheless, the fact remained, it was impossible
to dislike any one if one looked at them. she liked his eyes; they
were blue, deep set, frightening.

"do you write many letters, mr. tansley?" asked mrs. ramsay, pitying him
too, lily supposed; for that was true of mrs. ramsay--she pitied men
always as if they lacked something--women never, as if they had
something. he wrote to his mother; otherwise he did not suppose he
wrote one letter a month, said mr. tansley, shortly.

for he was not going to talk the sort of rot these condescended to by
these silly women. he had been reading in his room, and now he came
down and it all seemed to him silly, superficial, flimsy. why did they
dress? he had come down

nary clothes. he had not got any
dress clothes. "one never gets anything worth having by post"--that
was the sort of thing they were always saying. they made men say that
sort of thing. yes, it was pretty well true, he thought. they never
got anything worth having from one year's end to another. they did
nothing but talk, talk, talk, eat, eat, eat. it was the women's fault.
women made civilisation impossible with all their "charm," all their
silliness.

"no going to the lighthouse tomorrow, mrs. ramsay," he said, asserting
himself. he liked her; he admired her; he still thought of the man in
the drain-pipe looking up at her; but he felt it necessary to assert
himself.

he was really, lily briscoe thought, in spite of his eyes, but then
look at his nose, look at his hands, the most uncharming human being
she had ever met. then why did she mind what he said? women can't
write, women can't paint--what did that matter coming from him, since
clearly it was not true to him but for some reason helpf

 wanted revenge take it by laughing at him?

"oh, mr. tansley," she said, "do take me to the lighthouse with you. i
should so love it."

she was telling lies he could see. she was saying what she did not
mean to annoy him, for some reason. she was laughing at him. he was in
his old flannel trousers. he had no others. he felt very rough and
isolated and lonely. he knew that she was trying to tease him for some
reason; she didn't want to go to the lighthouse with him; she despised
him: so did prue ramsay; so did they all. but he was not going to be
made a fool of by women, so he turned deliberately in his chair and
looked out of the window and said, all in a jerk, very rudely, it would
be too rough for her tomorrow. she would be sick.

it annoyed him that she should have made him speak like that, with mrs.
ramsay listening. if only he could be alone in his room working, he
thought, among his books. that was where he felt at his ease. and he
had never run a penny into debt; he had never cost his

since he was fifteen; he had helped them at home out of his savings; he
was educating his sister. still, he wished he had known how to answer
miss briscoe properly; he wished it had not come out all in a jerk like
that. "you'd be sick." he wished he could think of something to say to
mrs. ramsay, something which would show her that he was not just a dry
prig. that was what they all thought him. he turned to her. but mrs.
ramsay was talking about people he had never heard of to william
bankes.

"yes, take it away," she said briefly, interrupting what she was saying
to william bankes to speak to the maid. "it must have been fifteen--
no, twenty years ago--that i last saw her," she was saying, turning
back to him again as if she could not lose a moment of their talk, for
she was absorbed

by what they were saying. so he had actually heard
from her this evening! and was carrie still living at marlow, and was
everything still the same? oh, she could remember it as if it were
yesterday--on the river, feeling it as if it were yesterday--going on
the river, feeling very cold. but if the mannings made a plan they
stuck to it. never should she forget herbert killing a wasp with a
teaspoon on the bank! and it was still going on, mrs. ramsay mused,
gliding like a ghost among the chairs and tables of that drawing-room
on the banks of the thames where she had been so very, very cold twenty
years ago; but now she went among them like a ghost; and it fascinated
her, as if, while she had changed, that particular day, now become very
still and beautiful, had remained there, all these years. had carrie
written to him herself? she asked.

"yes. she says they're building a new billiard room," he said. no!
no! that was out of the question! b

it seemed to her impossible.

mr. bankes could not see that there was anything very odd about it.
they were very well off now. should he give her love to carrie?

"oh," said mrs. ramsay with a little start, "no," she added, reflecting
that she did not know this carrie who built a new billiard room. but
how strange, she repeated, to mr. bankes's amusement, that they should
be going on there still. for it was extraordinary to think that they
had been capable of going on living all these years when she had not
thought of them more than once all that time. how eventful her own
life had been, during those same years. yet perhaps carrie manning
had not thought about her, either. the

 thought was strange and
distasteful.

"people soon drift apart," said mr. bankes, feeling, however, some
satisfaction when he thought that after all he knew both the mannings
and the ramsays. he had not drifted apart he thought, laying down his
spoon and wiping his clean-shaven lips punctiliously. but perhaps he
was rather unusual, he thought, in this; he never let himself get into
a groove. he had friends in all circles... mrs. ramsay had to break
off here to tell the maid something about keeping food hot. that was
why he preferred dining alone. all those interruptions annoyed him.
well, thought william bankes, preserving a demeanour of exquisite
courtesy and merely spreading the fingers of his left hand on the
table-cloth as a mechanic examines a tool beautifully polished and
ready for use in an interval of leisure, such are the sacrifices one's
friends ask of one. it would have hurt her if he had refused to come.
but it wa

s not worth it for him. looking at his hand he thought that
if he had been alone dinner would have been almost over now; he would
have been free to work. yes, he thought, it is a terrible waste of
time. the children were dropping in still. "i wish one of you would
run up to roger's room," mrs. ramsay was saying. how trifling it all
is, how boring it all is, he thought, compared with the other thing--
work. here he sat drumming his fingers on the table-cloth when he
might have been--he took a flashing bird's-eye view of his work. what
a waste of time it all was to be sure! yet, he thought, she is one of
my oldest friends. i am by way of being devoted to her. yet now, at
this moment her presence meant absolutely nothing to him: her beauty
meant nothing to him; her sitting with her little boy

does one live for? why, one asked oneself, does one take all these
pains for the human race to go on? is it so very desirable? are we
attractive as a species? not so very, he thought, looking at those
rather untidy boys. his favourite, cam, was in bed, he supposed.
foolish questions, vain questions, questions one never asked
if one was occupied. is human life this? is human life that? one
never had time to think about it. but here he was asking himself that
sort of question, because mrs. ramsay was giving orders to servants, and
also because it had struck him, thinking how surprised mrs. ramsay was
that carrie manning should still exist, that friendships, even the best
of them, are frail things. one drifts apart. he reproached himself
again. he was sitting beside mrs. ramsay and he had nothing in the
world to say to her.

"i'm so sorry," said mrs. ramsy, turning to him at last. he felt rigid
and barren, like a pair of boots that have been soaked and gone dry so

unity, suggests that every one shall speak in french. perhaps it is
bad french; french may not contain the words that express the speaker's
thoughts; nevertheless speaking french imposes some order, some
uniformity. replying to her in the same language, mr. bankes said, "no,
not at all," and mr. tansley, who had no knowledge of this language,
even spoke thus in words of one syllable, at once suspected its
insincerity. they did talk nonsense, he thought, the ramsays; and he
pounced on this fresh instance with joy, making a note which, one of
these days, he would read aloud, to one or two friends. there, in a
society where one could say what one liked he would sarcastically
describe "staying with the ramsays" and what nonsense they talked. it
was worth while doing it once, he would say; but not again. the women
bored one so, he would say. of course ramsay had dished himself by
marrying a beautiful woman and having eight children. it would shape

he could almost pity these mild cultivated people, who would be blown
sky high, like bales of wool and barrels of apples, one of these days
by the gunpowder that was in him.

"will you take me, mr. tansley?" said lily, quickly, kindly, for, of
course, if mrs. ramsay said to her, as in effect she did, "i am

anguish of this hour and say something nice to that young man there,
life will run upon the rocks--indeed i hear the grating and the

in a pause. they had to listen to him when he said that he had been

banks. he said they had built a billiard room--was it possible?
would william go on talking about the mannings? she wanted him to.
but, no--for some reason he was no longer in the mood. she tried.
he did not respond. she could not force him. she was disappointed.

"the children are disgraceful," she said, sighing. he said something
about punctuality being one of the minor virtues which we do not
acquire until later in life.

"if at all," said mrs. ramsay merely to fill up space, thinking what an
old maid william was becoming. conscious of his treachery, conscious
of her wish to talk about something more intimate, yet out of mood for
it at present, he felt come over him the disagreeableness of life,
sitting there, waiting. perhaps the others were saying something
interesting? what were they saying?

that the fishing season was bad; that the men were emigrating. they
were talking about wages and unemployment. the young man was abusing

him say something about "one of the most scandalous acts of the present

all listening. but already bored, lily felt that something was lacking;
mr. bankes felt that something was lacking. pulling her shawl round her
mrs. ramsay felt that something was lacking. all of them bending
themselves to listen thought, "pray heaven that the inside of my mind
may not be exposed," for each thought, "the others are feeling this.

fishermen. whereas, i feel nothing at all." but perhaps, thought mr.

hopelessly behind the times. he seemed to be rather cocksure, this
young man; and his manners were bad. but mr. bankes bade himself
observe, he had courage; he had ability; he was extremely well up in
the facts. probably, mr. bankes thought, as tansley abused the
government, there is a good deal in what he says.

"tell me now..." he said. so they argued about politics, and lily
looked at the leaf on the table-cloth; and mrs. ramsay, leaving the
argument entirely in the hands of the two men, wondered why she was so
bored by this talk, and wished, looking at her husband at the other end
of the table, that he would say something. one word, she said to
herself. for if he said a thing, it would make all the difference. he
went to the heart of things. he cared about fishermen and their wages.
he could not sleep for thinking of them. it was altogether different

his brow, and she knew that in a moment something violent would
explode, and then--thank goodness! she saw him clutch himself and clap
a brake on the wheel, and the whole of his body seemed to emit sparks
but not words. he sat there scowling. he had said nothing, he would
have her observe. let her give him the credit for that! but why
after all should poor augustus not ask for another plate of soup? he
had merely touched ellen's arm and said:

"ellen, please, another plate of soup," and then mr. ramsay scowled like
that.

and why not? mrs. ramsay demanded. surely they could let augustus have
his soup if he wanted it. he hated people wallowing in food, mr. ramsay
frowned at her. he hated everything dragging on for hours like this.
but he had controlled himself, mr. ramsay would have her observe,
disgusting though the sight was. but why show it so plainly, mrs.
ramsay demanded (they looked at each other down the long table sending
these questions and answers across, each knowing exactly what th

felt). everybody could see, mrs. ramsay thought. there was rose gazing
at her father, there was roger gazing at his father; both would be off
in spasms of laughter in another second, she knew, and so she said
promptly (indeed it was time):

"light the candles," and they jumped up instantly and went and fumbled
at the sideboard.

why could he never conceal his feelings? mrs. ramsay wondered, and she
wondered if augustus carmichael had noticed. perhaps he had; perhaps
he had not. she could not help respecting the composure with which he
sat there, drinking his soup. if he wanted soup, he asked for soup.
whether people laughed at him or were angry with him he was the same.
he did not like her, she knew that; but partly for that very reason she
respected him, and looking at him, drinking soup, very large and calm
in the failing light, and monumental, and contemplative, she w

n the lawn brooding presumably over his poetry, till he
reminded one of a cat watching birds, and then he clapped his paws
together when he had found the word, and her husband said, "poor old
augustus--he's a true poet," which was high praise from her husband.

now eight candles were stood down the table, and after the first stoop
the flames stood upright and drew with them into visibility the long
table entire, and in the middle a yellow and purple dish of fruit. what
had she done with it, mrs. ramsay wondered, for rose's arrangement of
the grapes and pears, of the horny pink-lined shell, of the bananas,
made her think of a trophy fetched from the bottom of the sea, of
neptune's banquet, of the bunch that hangs with vine leaves over the
shoulder of bacchus (in some picture), among the leopard skins and the
torches lolloping red and gold... thus brought up suddenly into the
light it seemed possessed of great size and depth, was like a world in
which one could take one's staff and climb hills,

a table, for the night
was now shut off by panes of glass, which, far from giving any accurate
view of the outside world, rippled it so strangely that here, inside
the room, seemed to be order and dry land; there, outside, a reflection
in which things waved and vanished, waterily.

some change at once went through them all, as if this had really
happened, and they were all conscious of making a party together in a
hollow, on an island; had their common cause against that fluidity out
there. mrs. ramsay, who had been uneasy, waiting for paul and minta to
come in, and unable, she felt, to settle to things, now felt her
uneasiness changed to expectation. for now they must come, and lily
briscoe, trying to analyse the cause of the sudden exhilaration,
compared it with that moment on the tennis lawn, when solidity suddenly
vanished, and such vast spaces lay between them; and now the same
effect was got by the many candles in the sparely furnished room, and
the uncurtained windows, and the bright m

candlelight. some weight was taken off them; anything might happen,
she felt. they must come now, mrs. ramsay thought, looking at the door,
and at that instant, minta doyle, paul rayley, and a maid carrying a
great dish in her hands came in together. they were awfully late; they
were horribly late, minta said, as they found their way to different
ends of the table.

"i lost my brooch--my grandmother's brooch," said minta with a sound of
lamentation in her voice, and a suffusion in her large brown eyes,
looking down, looking up, as she sat by mr. ramsay, which roused his
chivalry so that he bantered her

ignorant than she was, because he liked telling her she was a
fool. and so tonight, directly he laughed at her, she was not
frightened. besides, she knew, directly she came into the room that the
miracle had happened; she wore her golden haze. sometimes she had it;
sometimes not. she never knew why it came or why it went, or if she
had it until she came into the room and then she knew instantly by the
way some man looked at her. yes, tonight she had it, tremendously; she
knew that by the way mr. ramsay told her not to be a fool. she sat
beside him, smiling.

it must have happened then, thought mrs. ramsay; they are engaged. and
for a moment she felt what she had never expected to feel again--
jealousy. for he, her husband, felt it too--minta's glow; he liked
these girls, these golden-reddish girls, with something flying,
something a little wild and harum-scarum about them, who didn't

favourites of girls like minta. they might cut his hair from him,
plait him watch-chains, or interrupt him at his work, hailing him (she
heard them), "come along, mr. ramsay; it's our turn to beat them now,"
and out he came to play tennis.

but indeed she was not jealous, only, now and then, when she made
herself look in her glass, a little resentful that she had grown old,
perhaps, by her own fault. (the bill for the greenhouse and all the
rest of it.) she was grateful to them for laughing at him. ("how many
pipes have you smoked today, mr. ramsay?" and so on), till he seemed a
young man; a man very attractive to women, not burdened, not weighed

her. "we"--that was enough. she knew from the effort, the rise in his
voice to surmount a difficult word that it was the first time he had
said "we." "we did this, we did that." they'll say that all their
lives, she thought, and an exquisite scent of olives and oil and juice
rose from the great brown dish as marthe, with a little flourish, took
the cover off. the cook had spent three days over that dish. and she
must take great care, mrs. ramsay thought, diving into the soft mass, to
choose a specially tender piece for william bankes. and she peered into
the dish, with its shiny walls and its confusion of savoury brown and
yellow meats and its bay leaves and its wine, and thought, this will
celebrate the occasion--a curious sense rising in her, at once freakish
and tender, of celebrating a festival, as if two emotions were called
up in her, one profound--for what could be more serious than the love
of man for woman, what more commandin

he had eaten attentively. it was rich; it was tender. it was perfectly
cooked. how did she manage these things in the depths of the country?
he asked her. she was a wonderful woman. all his love, all his
reverence, had returned; and she knew it.

"it is a french recipe of my grandmother's," said mrs. ramsay, speaking
with a ring of great pleasure in her voice. of course it was french.
what passes for cookery in england is an abomination (they agreed). it
is putting cabbages in water. it is roasting meat till it is like
leather. it is cutting off the delicious skins of vegetables. "in
which," said mr. bankes, "all the virtue of the vegetable is contained."
and the waste, said mrs. ramsay. a whole french family could live on
what an english cook throws away. spurred on by her sense that

brought this off--paul and minta, one might suppose, were engaged. mr.
bankes was dining here. she put a spell on them all, by wishing, so
simply, so directly, and lily contrasted that abundance with her own
poverty of spirit, and supposed that it was partly that belief (for her
face was all lit up--without looking young, she looked radiant) in this
strange, this terrifying thing, which made paul rayley, sitting at her
side, all of a tremor, yet abstract, absorbed, silent. mrs. ramsay,
lily felt, as she talked about the skins of vegetables, exalted that,
worshipped that; held her hands over it to warm them, to protect it,
and yet, having brought it all about, somehow laughed, led her victims,
lily felt, to the altar. it came over her too now--the emotion, the
vibration, of love. how inconspicuous she felt herself by paul's side!

d, ready to implore a share, if it were a disaster, in
his disaster, she said shyly:

"when did minta lose her brooch?"

he smiled the most exquisite smile, veiled by memory, tinged by dreams.
he shook his head. "on the beach," he said.

"i'm going to find it," he said, "i'm getting up early." this being
kept secret from minta, he lowered his voice, and turned his eyes to
where she sat, laughing, beside mr. ramsay.

lily wanted to protest violently and outrageously her desire to help
him, envisaging how in the dawn on the beach she would be the one to
pounce on the brooch half-hidden by some stone, and thus herself be
included among the sailors and adventurers. but what did he reply to
her offer? she actually said with an emotion that she seldom let
appear, "let me come with you," and he laughed. he meant yes or no--
either perhaps. but it was not his meaning--it was the odd chuckle
he gave, as if he had

 said, throw yourself over the cliff if you like,
i don't care. he turned on her cheek the heat of love, its horror, its
cruelty, its unscrupulosity. it scorched her, and lily, looking at
minta, being charming to mr. ramsay at the other end of the table,
flinched for her exposed to these fangs, and was thankful. for at any
rate, she said to herself, catching sight of the salt cellar on the
pattern, she need not marry, thank heaven: she need not undergo that
degradation. she was saved from that dilution. she would move the tree
rather more to the middle.

such was the complexity of things. for what happened to her,
especially staying with the ramsays, was to be made to feel violently

s, puerile, and inhumane than this;
yet it is also beautiful and necessary. well then, well then? she
asked, somehow expecting the others to go on with the argument, as if
in an argument like this one threw one's own little bolt which fell
short obviously and left the others to carry it on. so she listened
again to what they were saying in case they should throw any light upon
the question of love.

"then," said mr. bankes, "there is that liquid the english call coffee."

"oh, coffee!" said mrs. ramsay. but it was much rather a question (she
was thoroughly roused, lily could see, and talked very emphatically) of
real butter and clean milk. speaking with warmth and eloquence, she
described the iniquity of the english dairy system, and in what state
milk was delivered at the door, and was about to prove her charges, for
she had gone into the matter, when all round the table, beginning with
andrew in the middle, like a fire leaping from tuft to tuft of furze,

only retaliate by displaying the raillery and ridicule of the table
to mr. bankes as an example of what one suffered if one attacked the
prejudices of the british public.

purposely, however, for she had it on her mind that lily, who had
helped her with mr. tansley, was out of things, she exempted her from
the rest; said "lily anyhow agrees with me," and so drew her in, a
little fluttered, a little startled. (for she was thinking about
love.) they were both out of things, mrs. ramsay had been thinking,
both lily and charles tansley. both suffered from the glow of the
other two. he, it was clear, felt himself utterly in the cold; no
woman would look at him with paul rayley in the room. poor fellow!
still, he had his dissertation, the influence of somebody upon
something: he could take care of himself. with lily it was different.

es. everything about her was so small. yet, thought mrs.
ramsay, comparing her with minta, as she claimed her help (for lily
should bear her out she talked no more about her dairies than her
husband did about his boots--he would talk by the hour about his boots)
of the two, lily at forty will be the better. there was in lily a
thread of something; a flare of something; something of her own which
mrs. ramsay liked very much indeed, but no man would, she feared.
obviously, not, unless it were a much older man, like william bankes.
but then he cared, well, mrs. ramsay sometimes thought that he cared,
since his wife's death, perhaps for her. he was not "in love" of
course; it was one of those unclassified affections of which there are
so many. oh, but nonsense, she thought; william must marry lily. they
have so many things in common. lily is so fond of flowers. they are
both cold and aloof and rather

d this way and that, like
iron girders spanning the swaying fabric, upholding the world, so that
she could trust herself to it utterly, even shut her eyes, or flicker
them for a moment, as a child staring up from its pillow winks at the
myriad layers of the leaves of a tree. then she woke up. it was still
being fabricated. william bankes was praising the waverly novels.

he read one of them every six months, he said. and why should that make
charles tansley angry? he rushed in (all, thought mrs. ramsay, because
prue will not be nice to him) and denounced the waverly novels when he
knew nothing about it, nothing about it whatsoever, mrs. ramsay thought,
observing him rather than listening to what he said. she could see how
it was from his manner--he wanted to assert himself, and so it would
always be with him till he got his professorship or married his wife,
and so need not be always saying, "i--i--i." for that was what his
criticism of poor sir walter, or perhaps it was jane austen, amounted

es (who was entirely free from all such vanity) laughed, and said
he attached no importance to changes in fashion. who could tell what
was going to last--in literature or indeed in anything else?

"let us enjoy what we do enjoy," he said. his integrity seemed to mrs.
ramsay quite admirable. he never seemed for a moment to think, but how
does this affect me? but then if you had the other temperament, which
must have praise, which must have encouragement, naturally you began
(and she knew that mr. ramsay was beginning) to be uneasy; to want
somebody to say, oh, but your work will last, mr. ramsay, or something
like that. he showed his uneasiness quite clearly now by saying, with
some irritation, that, anyhow, scott (or was it shakespeare ?) would
last him his lifetime. he said it irritably. everybody, she thought,
felt a little uncomfortable, without knowing why. then minta doyle,
whose instinct was fine, said bluffly, absurdly, that she did not
believe that any one really enjoyed reading shake

said grimly (but his mind was turned away again) that very few people
liked it as much as they said they did. but, he added, there is
considerable merit in some of the plays nevertheless, and mrs. ramsay
saw that it would be all right for the moment anyhow; he would laugh at
minta, and she, mrs. ramsay saw, realising his extreme anxiety about
himself, would, in her own way, see that he was taken care of, and
praise him, somehow or other. but she wished it was not necessary:
perhaps it was her fault that it was necessary. anyhow, she was free
now to listen to what paul rayley was trying to say about books one had
read as a boy. they lasted, he said. he had read some of tolstoi at
school. there was one he always remembered, but he had forgotten the
name. russian names were impossible, said mrs.

paul. he remembered that because he always thought it such a good name
for a villain. "vronsky," said mrs. ramsay; "oh, anna karenina," but
that did not take them very far; books were not in their line. no,
charles tansley would put them both right in a second about books, but
it was all so mixed up with, am i saying the right thing? am i making
a good impression? that, after all, one knew more about him than
about tolstoi, whereas, what paul said was about the thing, simply, not
himself, nothing else. like all stupid people, he had a kind of
modesty too, a consideration for what you were feeling, which, o

people. but when she looked at prue tonight, she saw that this was
not now quite true of her. she was just beginning, just moving,
just descending. the faintest light was on her face, as if the
glow of minta opposite, some excitement, some anticipation of happiness
was reflected in her, as if the sun of the love of men and women rose
over the rim of the table-cloth, and without knowing what it was she
bent towards it and greeted it. she kept looking at minta, shyly, yet
curiously, so that mrs. ramsay looked from one to the other and said,
speaking to prue in her own mind, you will be as happy as she is one of
these days. you will be much happier, she added, because you are my
daughter, she meant; her own daughter must be happier than other
people's daughters. but dinner was over. it was time to go. they
were only playing with things on their plates. she would wait until
they had done laughing at some story her husband was telling. he was
having a joke with minta about a bet. then she would

it was necessary now to carry everything a step further. with her foot
on the threshold she waited a moment longer in a scene which was
vanishing even as she looked, and then, as she moved and took minta's
arm and left the room, it changed, it shaped itself differently; it had
become, she knew, giving one last look at it over her shoulder, already
the past.

as usual, lily thought. there was always something that had to be done
at that precise moment, something that mrs. ramsay had decided for
reasons of her own to do instantly, it might be with every one standing
about making jokes, as now, not being able to decide whether they were
going into the smoking-room, into the drawing-room, up to the attics.
then one saw mrs. ramsay in the midst of this hubbub standing there with
minta's arm in hers, bethink her, "yes, it is time for that now," and
so make off at once with an air of secrecy to do something alone. and
directly she went a sort of disintegration set in; they w

nkes took charles tansley by the arm and went
off to finish on the terrace the discussion they had begun at dinner
about politics, thus giving a turn to the whole poise of the evening,
making the weight fall in a different direction, as if, lily thought,
seeing them go, and hearing a word or two about the policy of the
labour party, they had gone up on to the bridge of the ship and were
taking their bearings; the change from poetry to politics struck her
like that; so mr. bankes and charles mrs. ramsay going upstairs in the
lamplight alone. where, lily wondered, was she going so quickly?

not that she did in fact run or hurry; she went indeed rather slowly.
she felt rather inclined just for a moment to stand still after all
that chatter, and pick out one particular thing; the thing that
mattered; to detach it; separate it off; clean it of all the emotions
and odds and ends of things, and so hold it before her, and bring it to
the tribunal where, ranged about in conclave, sat the judges she ha

was nailed fast, mildred said, and cam couldn't go to sleep with it in
the room, and james screamed if she touched it.

then cam must go to sleep (it had great horns said cam)--must go to
sleep and dream of lovely palaces, said mrs. ramsay, sitting down
on the bed by her side. she could see the horns, cam said, all over
the room. it was true. wherever they put the light (and james could
not sleep without a light) there was always a shadow somewhere.

"but think, cam, it's only an old pig," said mrs. ramsay, "a nice black
pig like the pigs at the farm." but cam thought it was a horrid thing,
branching at her all over the room.

the fairies would love it; it was like a bird's nest; it was like a

flowers and bells ringing and birds singing and little goats and
antelopes and... she could see the words echoing as she spoke them
rhythmically in cam's mind, and cam was repeating after her how it was
like a mountain, a bird's nest, a garden, and there were little
antelopes, and her eyes were opening and shutting, and mrs. ramsay went
on speaking still more monotonously, and more rhythmically and more
nonsensically, how she must shut her eyes and go to sleep and dream of
mountains and valleys and stars falling and parrots and antelopes and
gardens, and everything lovely, she said, raising her head very slowly
and speaking more and more mechanically, until she sat upright and saw
that cam was asleep.

too, for see, she said, the boar's skull was still t

fore, talking with the
others, she became a child again, and what they had been doing was a
game, and would her mother sanction their game, or condemn it, she
wondered. and thinking what a chance it was for minta and paul and
lily to see her, and feeling what an extraordinary stroke of fortune it
was for her, to have her, and how she would never grow up and never
leave home, she said, like a child, "we thought of going down to the
beach to watch the waves."

instantly, for no reason at all, mrs. ramsay became like a girl of
twenty, full of gaiety. a mood of revelry suddenly took possession of
her. of course they must go; of course they must go, she cried,
laughing; and running down the last three or four steps quickly, she
began turning from one to the other and laughing and drawing minta's
wrap round her and saying she only wished she could come too, and would
they be very late, and had any of them got a watch?

"yes, paul has," said minta. paul slipped a beautiful gold watch out
of a little

 wash-leather case to show her. and as he held it in the
palm of his hand before her, he felt, "she knows all about it. i need
not say anything." he was saying to her as he showed her the watch,
"i've done it, mrs. ramsay. i owe it all to you." and seeing the gold
watch lying in his hand, mrs. ramsay felt, how extraordinarily lucky
minta is! she is marrying a man who has a gold watch in a wash-
leather bag!

"how i wish i could come with you!" she cried. but she was withheld by
something so strong that she never even thought of asking herself what
it was. of course it was impossible for her to go with them. but she
would have liked to go, had it not been for the other thing, and
tickled by the absurdity of her thought (how lucky to marry a man
with a wash-leather bag for his watch) she went

might say; and his own position became more secure. the lovers were
fiddlesticks, he thought, collecting it all in his mind again. that's
fiddlesticks, that's first-rate, he thought, putting one thing beside
another. but he must read it again. he could not remember the whole
shape of the thing. he had to keep his judgement in suspense. so he
returned to the other thought--if young men did not care for this,
naturally they did not care for him either. one ought not to complain,
thought mr. ramsay, trying to stifle his desire to complain to his wife
that young men did not admire him. but he was determined; he would not
bother her again. here he looked at her reading. she looked very
peaceful, reading. he liked to think that every one had taken
themselves off and that he and she were alone. the whole of life did
not consist in going to bed with a woman, he thought, returning to
scott and balzac, to the english novel and the french novel.

mrs. ramsay raised her head and like a person in a

the spring without a leaf to toss, bare and bright like a virgin fierce
in her chastity, scornful in her purity, was laid out on fields wide-
eyed and watchful and entirely careless of what was done or thought by
the beholders. [prue ramsay, leaning on her father's arm, was given in
marriage. what, people said, could have been more fitting? and, they
added, how beautiful she looked!]

as summer neared, as the evenings lengthened, there came to the
wakeful, the hopeful, walking the beach, stirring the pool,
imaginations of the strangest kind--of flesh turned to atoms which
drove before the wind, of stars flashing in their hearts, of cliff,
sea, cloud, and sky brought purposely together to assemble outwardly
the scattered parts of t

 some crystal of intensity, remote from the known
pleasures and familiar virtues, something alien to the processes of
domestic life, single, hard, bright, like a diamond in the sand, which
would render the possessor secure. moreover, softened and acquiescent,
the spring with her bees humming and gnats dancing threw her cloak
about her, veiled her eyes, averted her head, and among passing shadows
and flights of small rain seemed to have taken upon her a knowledge of
the sorrows of mankind.

[prue ramsay died that summer in some illness connected with
childbirth, which was indeed a tragedy, people said, everything, they
said, had promised so well.]

and now in the heat of summer the wind sent its spies about the house
again. flies wove a web in the sunny rooms; weeds that had grown close
to the glass in the night tapped methodically at the window pane. when
darkness fell, the stroke of the lighthouse, which had laid itself with
such authority upon the carpet in the darkness, tracing its pattern

were bright and light turned on the wall its shape clearly there seemed
to drop into this silence, this indifference, this integrity, the thud
of something falling.

among them andrew ramsay, whose death, mercifully, was instantaneous.]

at that season those who had gone down to pace the beach and ask of the
sea and sky what message they reported or what vision they affirmed had
to consider among the usual tokens of divine bounty--the sunset on
the sea, the pallor of dawn, the moon rising, fishing-boats against the
moon, and children making mud pies or pelting each other with handfuls
of grass, something out of harmony with this jocundity and this
serenity. there was the silent app

they should have sent somebody down to see. for there were clothes

was she to do with them? they had the moth in them--mrs. ramsay's

gardening (mrs. mcnab fingered it). she could see her, as she came up
the drive with the washing, stooping over her flowers (the garden was a
pitiful sight now, all run to riot, and rabbits scuttling at you out of
the beds)--she could see her with one of the children by her in that

they had been coming, but had put off coming, what with the war, and

years; just sent her money; but never wrote, never came, and expected

drawers were full of things (she pulled them open), handkerchiefs, bits
of ribbon. yes, she could see mrs. ramsay as she came up the drive with
the washing.

"good-evening, mrs. mcnab," she would say.

many things had changed since then (she shut the drawer); many families
had lost their dearest. so she was dead; and mr. andrew killed; and

what does it mean then, what can it all mean? lily briscoe asked
herself, wondering whether, since she had been left alone, it behoved
her to go to the kitchen to fetch another cup of coffee or wait here.
what does it mean?--a catchword that was, caught up from some book,
fitting her thought loosely, for she could not, this first morning with
the ramsays, contract her feelings, could only make a phrase resound to
cover the blankness of her mind until these vapours had shrunk. for
really, what did she feel, come back after all these years and mrs.
ramsay dead? nothing, nothing--nothing that she could express at all.

she had come late last night when it was all mysterious, dark. now she
was awake, at her old place at the breakfast table, but alone. it was

a rage. one seemed to hear doors slamming and voices calling all over
the house. now nancy burst in, and asked, looking round the room, in a
queer half dazed, half desperate way, "what does one send to the
lighthouse?" as if she were forcing herself to do what she despaired of
ever being able to do.

seemed strangers to her. she had no attachment here, she felt, no
relations with it, anything might happen, and whatever did happen, a
step outside, a voice calling ("it's not in the cupboard; it's on the
landing," some one cried), was a question, as if the link that usually
bound things together had been cut, and they floated up here, down
there, off, anyhow. how aimless it was,, how chaotic, how unreal it
was, she thought, looking at her empty coffee cup. mrs. ramsay dead;
andrew killed; prue dead too--repeat it as she might, it roused no
feeling in her. and we all get together in a house like this on a
morning like this, she said, looking out of the window. it was a
beautiful still day.

suddenly mr. ramsay raised his head as he passed and looked straight at
her, with his distraught wild gaze which was yet so penetrating, as if
he saw you, for one second, for the first time, for ever; and she
pretended to drink out of her empty coffee cup so as to esc

the grey-green light on the wall opposite. the empty places. such were
some of the parts, but how bring them together? she asked. as if any
interruption would break the frail shape she was building on the table
she turned her back to the window lest mr. ramsay should see her. she
must escape somewhere, be alone somewhere. suddenly she remembered.
when she had sat there last ten years ago there had been a little sprig
or leaf pattern on the table-cloth, which she had looked at in a moment
of revelation. there had been a problem about a foreground of a
picture. move the tree to the middle, she had said. she had never
finished that picture. she would paint that picture now. it had been
knocking about in her mind all these years. where were her paints, s

she would start at once. she got up quickly, before mr. ramsay turned.

she fetched herself a chair. she pitched her easel with her precise
old-maidish movements on the edge of the lawn, not too close to mr.
carmichael, but close enough for his protection. yes, it must have
been precisely here that she had stood ten years ago. there was the
wall; the hedge; the tree. the question was of some relation between
those masses. she had borne it in her mind all these years. it seemed
as if the solution had come to her: she knew now what she wanted to do.

time he approached--he was walking up and down the terrace--ruin
approached, chaos approached. she could not paint. she stooped, she
turned; she took up this rag; she squeezed that tube. but all she did
was to ward him off a moment. he made it impossible for her to do
anything. for if she gave him the least chance, if he saw her
disengaged a moment, looking his way a moment, he would be on her,
saying, as he had said last night, "you find us much

staring though they had all sat, the six children whom they used to
call after the kings and queens of england--the red, the fair, the
wicked, the ruthless--she felt how they raged under it. kind old mrs.
beckwith said something sensible. but it was a house full of unrelated
passions--she had felt that all the evening. and on top of this chaos
mr. ramsay got up, pressed her hand, and said: "you will find us much
changed" and none of them had moved or had spoken; but had sat there as
if they were forced to let him say it. only james (certainly the
sullen) scowled at the lamp; and cam screwed her handkerchief round her
finger. then he reminded them that they were going to the lighthouse
tomorrow. they must be ready, in the hall, on the stroke of half-past
seven. then, with his hand on the door, he stopped; he turned upon

james said yes. cam stumbled more wretchedly. yes, oh, yes, they'd
both be ready, they said. and it struck her, this was tragedy--not
palls, dust, and the shroud; but children coerced, their spirits
subdued. james was sixteen, cam, seventeen, perhaps. she had looked
round for some one who was not there, for mrs. ramsay, presumably. but
there was only kind mrs. beckwith turning over her sketches under the
lamp. then, being tired, her mind still rising and falling with the
sea, the taste and smell that places have after long absence possessing
her, the candles wavering in her eyes, she had lost herself and gone
under. it was a wonderful night, starlit; the waves sounded as they
went upstairs; the moon surprised them, enormous, pale, as they passed
the staircase window. she had slept at once.

but she hoped sufficiently substantial to ward off mr. ramsay and his
exactingness. she did her best to look, when his back was turned, at
her picture; that line there, that mass there. but it was out of the
question. let him be fifty feet away, let him not even speak to you,
let him not even see you, he permeated, he prevailed, he imposed
himself. he changed everything. she could not see the colour; she
could not see the lines; even with his back turned to her, she could

another. when would those children come? when would they all be off?
she fidgeted. that man, she thought, her anger rising in her, never
gave; that man took. she, on the other hand, would be forced to give.
mrs. ramsay had given. giving, giving, giving, she had died--and had
left all this. really, she was angry with mrs. ramsay. with the brush
slightly trembling in her fingers she looked at the hedge, the step,
the wall. it was all mrs. ramsay's doing. she was dead. here was lily,
at forty-four, wasting her time, unable to do a thing, standing there,
playing at painting, playing at the one thing one did not play at, and
it was all mrs. ramsay's fault. she was dead. the step where she used
to sit was empty. she was dead.

but why repeat this over and over again? why be always trying to bring
up some feeling she had not got? there was a kind of blasphemy in it.

greedy, distraught. well, thought lily in despair, letting her right
hand fall at her side, it would be simpler then to have it over.
surely, she could imitate from recollection the glow, the rhapsody, the
self-surrender, she had seen on so many women's faces (on mrs. ramsay's,
for instance) when on some occasion like this they blazed up--she could
remember the look on mrs. ramsay's face--into a rapture of sympathy, of
delight in the reward they had, which, though the reason of it escaped
her, evidently conferred on them the most supreme bliss of which human
nature was capable. here he was, stopped by her side. she would give
him what she could.

approach any woman, to force them, he did not care how, his need was so
great, to give him what he wanted: sympathy.

was anybody looking after her? he said. had she everything she
wanted?

"oh, thanks, everything," said lily briscoe nervously. no; she could
not do it. she ought to have floated off instantly upon some wave of
sympathetic expansion: the pressure on her was tremendous. but she
remained stuck. there was an awful pause. they both looked at the
sea. why, thought mr. ramsay, should she look at the sea when i am
here? she hoped it would be calm enough for them to land at the
lighthouse, she said. the lighthouse! the lighthouse! what's that
got to do with it? he thought impatiently. instantly, with the force
of some primeval gust (for really he could not restrain himself any
longer), there issued from him such a groan that any other woman in the
whole world would have done something, said something--all except
myself, thought lily, girding at herself bitterly, who a

anything? did she not see what he wanted from her? then he said he
had a particular reason for wanting to go to the lighthouse. his
wife used to send the men things. there was a poor boy with a
tuberculous hip, the lightkeeper's son. he sighed profoundly.
he sighed significantly. all lily wished was that this enormous flood
of grief, this insatiable hunger for sympathy, this demand that she
should surrender herself up to him entirely, and

even so he had sorrows
enough to keep her supplied for ever, should leave her, should be
diverted (she kept looking at the house, hoping for an interruption)
before it swept her down in its flow.

"such expeditions," said mr. ramsay, scraping the ground with his toe,
"are very painful." still lily said nothing. (she is a stock, she is a
stone, he said to himself.) "they are very exhausting," he said,
looking, with a sickly look that nauseated her (he was acting, she
felt, this great man was dramatising himself), at his beautiful hands.
it was horrible, it was indecent. would they never come, she asked,
for she could not sustain this enormous weight of sorrow, support these
heavy draperies of grief (he had assumed a pose of

decreptitude; he even tottered a little as he stood there) a moment
longer.

still she could say nothing; the whole horizon seemed swept bare of
objects to talk about; could only feel, amazedly, as mr. ramsay stood
there, how his gaze seemed to fall dolefully over the sunny grass and
discolour it, and cast over the rubicund, drowsy, entirely contented
figure of mr. carmichael, reading a french novel on a deck-chair, a veil
of crape, as if such an existence, flaunting its prosperity in a world
of woe, were enough to provoke the most dismal thoughts of all. look
at him, he seemed to be saying, look at me; and indeed, all the time he
was feeling, think of me, think of me. ah, could that bulk only be

fted alongside of them, lily wished; had she only pitched her easel a
yard or two closer to him; a man, any man, would staunch this effusion,
would stop these lamentations. a woman, she had provoked this horror;
a woman, she should have known how to deal with it. it was immensely
to her discredit, sexually, to stand there dumb. one said--what did
one say?--oh, mr. ramsay! dear mr. ramsay! that was what that kind old
lady who sketched, mrs. beckwith, would have said instantly, and
rightly. but, no. they stood there, isolated from the rest of the
world. his immense self-pity, his demand for sympathy poured and
spread itself in pools at ther feet, and all she did, miserable sinner
that she was, was to draw her skirts a little closer round her ankles,
lest she should get wet. in complete silence she stood there, grasping
her paint brush.

heaven could never be sufficiently praised!

 she heard sounds in the
house. james and cam must be coming. but mr. ramsay, as if he knew
that his time ran short, exerted upon her solitary figure the immense
pressure of his concentrated woe; his age; his frailty: his desolation;
when suddenly, tossing his head impatiently, in his annoyance--for
after all, what woman could resist him?--he noticed that his boot-laces
were untied. remarkable boots they were too, lily thought, looking
down at them: sculptured; colossal; like everything that mr. ramsay
wore, from his frayed tie to his half-buttoned waistcoat, his own
indisputably. she could see them walking to his room of their own
accord, expressive in his absence of pathos, surliness, ill-temper,
charm.

"what beautiful boots!" she exclaimed. she was ashamed of herself. to
praise his boots when he asked her to solace his soul; when he had
shown her his bleeding hands, his lacerated heart, and asked her to
pity them, then to say, cheerfully, "ah, but what beautiful boots you
wear!" deserved,

 she knew, and she looked up expecting to get it in one
of his sudden roars of ill-temper complete annihilation.

instead, mr. ramsay smiled. his pall, his draperies, his infirmities
fell from him. ah, yes, he said, holding his foot up for her to look
at, they were first-rate boots. there was only one man in england who
could make boots like that. boots are among the chief curses of
mankind, he said. "bootmakers make it their business," he exclaimed,
"to cripple and torture the human foot." they are also the most
obstinate and perverse of mankind. it had taken him the best part of
his youth to get boots made as they should be

knotted her shoe; three times he unknotted it.

why, at this completely inappropriate moment, when he was stooping over
her shoe, should she be so tormented with sympathy for him that, as she
stooped too, the blood rushed to her face, and, thinking of her
callousness (she had called him a play-actor) she felt her eyes swell
and tingle with tears? thus occupied he seemed to her a figure of
infinite pathos. he tied knots. he bought boots. there was no helping
mr. ramsay on the journey he was going. but now just as she wished to
say something, could have said something, perhaps, here they were--cam
and james. they appeared on the terrace. they came, lagging, side by
side, a serious, melancholy couple.

but why was it like that that they came? she could not help feeling
annoyed with them; they might have come more cheerfully; they might
have given him what, now that they were off, she would not have the
chance of giving him. for she felt a sudden emptiness; a fr

drawn acquiescent in their father's wake, obediently, but with a pallor
in their eyes which made her feel that they suffered something beyond
their years in silence. so they passed the edge of the lawn, and it
seemed to lily that she watched a procession go, drawn on by some
stress of common feeling which made it, faltering and flagging as it
was, a little company bound together and strangely impressive to her.
politely, but very distantly, mr. ramsay raised his hand and saluted her
as they passed.

but what a face, she thought, immediately finding the sympathy which
she had not been asked to give troubling her for expression. what had
made it like that? thinking, night after night, she supposed--about
the reality of kitchen tables, she added, remembering the symbol which
in her vagueness as to what mr. ramsay did think about andrew had given
her. (he had been killed by the splinter of a shell instantly, she
bethought her.) the kitchen table

 was something visionary, austere;
something bare, hard, not ornamental. there was no colour to it; it
was all edges and angles; it was uncompromisingly plain. but mr. ramsay
kept always his eyes fixed upon it, never allowed himself to be
distracted or deluded, until his face became worn too and ascetic and
partook of this unornamented beauty which so deeply impressed her.
then, she recalled (standing where he had left her, holding her brush),
worries had fretted it--not so nobly. he must have had his doubts
about that table, she supposed; whether the table was a real table;
whether it was worth the time he gave to it; whether he was able after
all to find it. he ha

d had doubts, she felt, or he would have asked
less of people. that was what they talked about late at night
sometimes, she suspected; and then next day mrs. ramsay looked tired,
and lily flew into a rage with him over some absurd little thing. but
now he had nobody to talk to about that table, or his boots, or his
knots; and he was like a lion seeking whom he could devour, and his
face had that touch of desperation, of exaggeration in it which alarmed
her, and made her pull her skirts about her. and then, she recalled,
there was that sudden revivification, that sudden flare (when she
praised his boots), that sudden recovery of vitality and interest in

browns, which had stayed in her mind; which had tied a knot in her mind
so that at odds and ends of time, involuntarily, as she walked along
the brompton road, as she brushed her hair, she found herself painting
that picture, passing her eye over it, and untying the knot in
imagination. but there was all the difference in the world between
this planning airily away from the canvas and actually taking her brush
and making the first mark.

she had taken the wrong brush in her agitation at mr. ramsay's presence,
and her easel, rammed into the earth so nervously, was at the wrong
angle. and now that she had ut that right, and in so doing had subdued
the impertinences and irrelevances that plucked her attention and made
her remember how she was such and such a person, had such and such
relations to people, she took her hand and raised her brush. for a
moment it stayed trembling in a painful but exciting ecstasy in the
air. where to begin?--that was the question at what point to make

thought, poor devils, of both sexes.) he was always carrying a book
about under his arm--a purple book. he "worked." he sat, she
remembered, working in a blaze of sun. at dinner he would sit right in
the middle of the view. but after all, she reflected, there was the
scene on the beach. one must remember that. it was a windy morning.
they had all gone down to the beach. mrs. ramsay sat down and wrote
letters by a rock. she wrote and wrote. "oh," she said, looking up at
something floating in the sea, "is it a lobster pot? is it an upturned
boat?" she was so short-sighted that she could not see, and then
charles tansley became as nice as he could possibly be. he began
playing ducks and drakes. they chose little flat black stones and sent
them skipping over the waves. every now and then mrs. ramsay looked up
over her spectacles and laughed at them. what they said she could n

well all of a sudden and mrs. ramsay watching them. she was highly
conscious of that. mrs. ramsay, she thought, stepping back and screwing
up her eyes. (it must have altered the design a good deal when she was
sitting on the step with james. there must have been a shadow.) when
she thought of herself and charles throwing ducks and drakes and of the
whole scene on the beach, it seemed to depend somehow upon mrs. ramsay
sitting under the rock, with a pad on her knee, writing letters. (she
wrote innumerable letters, and sometimes the wind took them and she and
charles just saved a page from the sea.) but what a power was in the
human soul! she thought. that woman sitting there writing under the
rock resolved everything into simplicity; made these angers,
irritations fall off like old rags; she brought together this and that
and then this, and so made out of that miserable silliness and spite

over her, paused over her, darkened over her. what is the meaning of
life? that was all--a simple question; one that tended to close in on
one with years. the great revelation had never come. the great
revelation perhaps never did come. instead there were little daily
miracles, illuminations, matches struck unexpectedly in the dark;
here was one. this, that, and the other; herself and charles tansley
and the breaking wave; mrs. ramsay bringing them together; mrs. ramsay
saying, "life stand still here"; mrs. ramsay making of the moment
something permanent (as in another sphere lily herself tried to
make of the moment something permanent)--this was of the nature
of a revelation. in the midst of chaos there was shape; this eternal
passing and flowing (she looked at the clouds going and the leaves
shaking) was struck into stability. life stand still here, mrs. ramsay
said. "mrs. ramsay! mrs. ramsay!" she repeated. she owed it al

all was silence. nobody seemed yet to be stirring in the house. she
looked at it there sleeping in the early sunlight with its windows
green and blue with the reflected leaves. the faint thought she was
thinking of mrs. ramsay seemed in consonance with this quiet house; this
smoke; this fine early morning air. faint and unreal, it was amazingly
pure and exciting. she hoped nobody would open the window or come out
of the house, but that she might be left alone to go on thinking, to go
on painting. she turned to her canvas. but impelled by some curiosity,
driven by the discomfort of the sympathy which she held undischarged,
she walked a pace or so to the end of the lawn to see whether, down
there on the beach, she coul

down there among the little boats which floated, some with their sails
furled, some slowly, for it was very calm moving away, there was one
rather apart from the others. the sail was even now being hoisted.
she decided that there in that very distant and entirely silent little
boat mr. ramsay was sitting with cam and james. now they had got the
sail up; now after a little flagging and silence, she watched the boat
take its way with deliberation past the other boats out to sea.

the sails flapped over their heads. the water chuckled and slapped the
sides of the boat, which drowsed motionless in the sun. now and then
the sails rippled with a little breeze in them, but the ripple ran over
them and ceased. the boat made no motion at all. mr. ramsay sat in the
middle of the boat. he

 would sail on for hours like this, and mr.
ramsay would ask old macalister a question--about the great storm
last winter probably--and old macalister would answer it, and they
would puff their pipes together, and macalister would take a tarry rope
in his fingers, tying or untying some knot, and the boy would fish, and
never say a word to any one. james would be forced to keep his eye all
the time on the sail. for if he forgot, then the sail puckered and
shivered, and the boat slackened, and mr. ramsay would say sharply,
"look out! look out!" and old macalister would turn slowly on his
seat. so they heard mr. ramsay asking some question about the great
storm at christmas. "she comes driving round the point," old
macalister said, describing the great storm last christmas, when ten
ships had been driven into the bay for shelter, and he had seen "one
there, one there, one there" (he pointed slowly round the bay. mr.
ramsay followed him, turning his head). he had seen four men clinging
to the mas

d james sagged a little. it slackened a little. she began to think,
how fast it goes. where are we going? and the movement hypnotised her,
while james, with his eye fixed on the sail and on the horizon, steered
grimly. but he began to think as he steered that he might escape; he
might be quit of it all. they might land somewhere; and be free then.
both of them, looking at each other for a moment, had a sense of escape
and exaltation, what with the speed and the change. but the breeze
bred in mr. ramsay too the same excitement, and, as old macalister
turned to fling his line overboard, he cried out aloud,

"we perished," and then again, "each alone." and then with his usual
spasm of repentance or shyness, pulled himself up, and waved his hand
towards the shore.

"see the little house," he said pointing, wishing cam to look. she
raised herself reluctantly and looked. but which was it? she could no
longer make out, there on the hillside, which was their house. all
looked distant and peaceful and

 strange. the shore seemed refined, far
away, unreal. already the little distance they had sailed had put them
far from it and given it the changed look, the composed look, of
something receding in which one has no longer any part. which was
their house? she could not see it.

"but i beneath a rougher sea," mr. ramsay murmured. he had found the
house and so seeing it, he had also seen himself there; he had seen
himself walking on the terrace, alone. he was walking up and down
between the urns; and he seemed to himself very old and bowed. sitting
in the boat, he bowed, he crouched himself, acting instantly his part--
the part of a desolate man, widowed, bereft; and so called up before
him in hosts people sympathising with him; staged for himself as he sat
in the boat, a little drama; which required of him dec

they lived right out there? and he pointed again, and
showed her where their house was, there, by those trees. he wished she
would try to be more accurate, he said: "tell me--which is east, which
is west?" he said, half laughing at her, half scolding her, for he
could not understand the state of mind of any one, not absolutely
imbecile, who did not know the points of the compass. yet she did not
know. and seeing her gazing, with her vague, now rather frightened,
eyes fixed where no house was mr. ramsay forgot his dream; how he walked
up and down between the urns on the terrace; how the arms were
stretched out to him. he thought, women are always like that; the
vagueness of their minds is hopeless; it was a thing he had never been
able to understand; but so it was. it had been so with her--his wife.
they could not keep anything clearly fixed in their minds. but he had
been wrong to be angry with her; moreover, did he not rather like this
vagueness in women? it was part of their extraordinary c

her, lend her his books. but could he believe that minta read them?
she dragged them about the garden, sticking in leaves to mark the
place.

"d'you remember, mr. carmichael?" she was inclined to ask, looking at
the old man. but he had pulled his hat half over his forehead; he was
asleep, or he was dreaming, or he was lying there catching words, she
supposed.

"d'you remember?" she felt inclined to ask him as she passed him,
thinking again of mrs. ramsay on the beach; the cask bobbing up and
down; and the pages flying. why, after all these years had that
survived, ringed round, lit up, visible to the last detail, with all
before it blank and all after it blank, for miles and miles?

"is it a boat? is it a cork?" she would say, lily repeated, turning
back, reluctantly again, to her canvas. heaven be praised for it, the
problem of space remained, she thought, taking up her brush again. it
glared at her. the whole mass of the picture was poised up

weight. beautiful and bright it should be on the surface, feathery and
evanescent, one colour melting into another like the colours on a
butterfly's wing; but beneath the fabric must be clamped together with
bolts of iron. it was to be a thing you could ruffle with your breath;
and a thing you could not dislodge with a team of horses. and she began
to lay on a red, a grey, and she began to model her way into the hollow
there. at the same time, she seemed to be sitting beside mrs. ramsay on
the beach.

"is it a boat? is it a cask?" mrs. ramsay said. and she began hunting
round for her spectacles. and she sat, having found them, silent,
looking out to sea. and lily, painting steadily, felt as if a door had
opened, and one went in and stood gazing silently about in a high
cathedral-like place, very dark, very solemn. shouts came from a world
far away. steamers vanished in stalks of smoke on the horizon.
charles threw stones and sent them skipping.

mrs. ramsay sat silent. she was

 glad, lily thought, to rest in silence,
uncommunicative; to rest in the extreme obscurity of human
relationships. who knows what we are, what we feel? who knows even at
the moment of intimacy, this is knowledge? aren't things spoilt then,
mrs. ramsay may have asked (it seemed to have happened so often, this
silence by her side) by saying them? aren't we more expressive thus?
the moment at least seemed extraordinarily fertile. she rammed a
little hole in the sand and covered it up, by way of burying in it the
perfection of the moment. it was like a drop of silver in which one
dipped and illumined the darkness of the past.

alone, over the sea. and as she dipped into the blue paint, she
dipped too into the past there. now mrs. ramsay got up, she
remembered. it was time to go back to the house--time for
luncheon. and they all walked up from the beach together, she walking
behind with william bankes, and there was minta in front of them with a
hole in her stocking. how that little round hole of pink heel seemed
to flaunt itself before them! how william bankes deplored it, without,
so far as she could remember, saying anything about it! it meant to
him the annihilation of womanhood, and dirt and disorder, and servants

shared paul's views (they had got more and more pronounced) about the
taxation of land values and a capital levy. far from breaking up the
marriage, that alliance had righted it. they were excellent friends,
obviously, as he sat on the road and she handed him his tools.

so that was the story of the rayleys, lily thought. she imagined
herself telling it to mrs. ramsay, who would be full of curiosity to
know what had become of the rayleys. she would feel a little
triumphant, telling mrs. ramsay that the marriage had not been a
success.

but the dead, thought lily, encountering some obstacle in her design
which made her pause and ponder, stepping back a foot or so, oh, the
dead! she murmured, one pitied them, one brushed them aside, one had
even a little contempt for them. they are at our mercy. mrs. ramsay
has faded and gone, she thought. we can over-ride her

(sitting very upright early in the morning with the birds beginning to
cheep in the garden outside). and one would have to say to her, it has
all gone against your wishes. they're happy like that; i'm happy like
this. life has changed completely. at that all her being, even her
beauty, became for a moment, dusty and out of date. for a moment lily,
standing there, with the sun hot on her back, summing up the rayleys,
triumphed over mrs. ramsay, who would never know how paul went to
coffee-houses and had a mistress; how he sat on the ground and minta
handed him his tools; how she stood here painting, had never married,
not even william bankes.

mrs. ramsay had planned it. perhaps, had she lived, she would have
compelled it. already that summer he was "the kindest of men." he was
"the first scientist of his age, my husband says." he was also "poor
william--it makes me so unhappy, when i go to see him, to find nothing
nice in his house-

-no one to arrange the flowers." so they were sent
for walks together, and she was told, with that faint touch of irony
that made mrs. ramsay slip through one's fingers, that she had a
scientific mind; she liked flowers; she was so exact. what was this
mania of hers for marriage? lily wondered, stepping to and fro from
her easel.

(suddenly, as suddenly as a star slides in the sky, a reddish light
seemed to burn in her mind, covering paul rayley, issuing from him. it
rose like a fire sent up in token of some celebration by savages on a
distant beach. she heard the roar and the crackle. the whole sea for
miles round ran red and gold.

nd one had only to say "in love"
and instantly, as happened now, up rose paul's fire again. and it sank
and she said to herself, laughing, "the rayleys"; how paul went to
coffee-houses and played chess.)

she had only escaped by the skin of her teeth though, she thought. she
had been looking at the table-cloth, and it had flashed upon her that
she would move the tree to the middle, and need never marry anybody,
and she had felt an enormous exultation. she had felt, now she could
stand up to mrs. ramsay--a tribute to the astonishing power that mrs.
ramsay had over one. do this, she said, and one did it. even her
shadow at the window with james was full of authority. she remembered
how william bankes had been shocked by her neglect of the significance
of mother and son. did she not admire their beauty? he said. but
william, she remembered, had listened to her with his wise child's eyes
when she explained how it was not irreverence: how a light there needed
a shadow there and so on. she did not

way that was natural to a man who spent spent so much time in
laboratories that the world when he came out seemed to dazzle him,
so that he walked slowly, lifted his hand to screen his eyes and
paused, with his head thrown back, merely to breathe the air. then
he would tell her how his housekeeper was on her holiday; he must
buy a new carpet for the staircase. perhaps she would go with him to
buy a new carpet for the staircase. and once something led him to talk
about the ramsays and he had said how when he first saw her she had
been wearing a grey hat; she was not more than nineteen or twenty. she
was astonishingly beautiful. there he stood looking down the avenue at
hampton court as if he could see her there among the fountains.

she looked now at the drawing-room step. she saw, through william's
eyes, the shape of a woman, peaceful and silent, with downcast eyes.
she sat musing, pondering (she was in grey that day, lily thought).

she wanted to go straight up to him and say, "mr. carmichael!" then he
would look up benevolently as always, from his smoky vague green eyes.
but one only woke people if one knew what one wanted to say to them.
and she wanted to say not one thing, but everything. little words that
broke up the thought and dismembered it said nothing. "about life,
about death; about mrs. ramsay"--no, she thought, one could say
nothing to nobody. the urgency of the moment always missed its mark.
words fluttered sideways and struck the object inches too low. then
one gave it up; then the idea sunk back again; then one became like
most middle-aged people, cautious, furtive, with wrinkles between the
eyes and a look of perpetual apprehension. for how could one express
in words these emotions of the body? express that emptiness there?
(she was looking at the drawing-room steps; they looked

sensations that went with the bare look of the steps had become
suddenly extremely unpleasant. to want and not to have, sent all up
her body a hardness, a hollowness, a strain. and then to want and not
to have--to want and want--how that wrung the heart, and wrung it again
and again! oh, mrs. ramsay! she called out silently, to that essence
which sat by the boat, that abstract one made of her, that woman in
grey, as if to abuse her for having gone, and then having gone, come
back again. it had seemed so safe, thinking of her. ghost, air,
nothingness, a thing you could play with easily and safely at any time
of day or night, she had been that, and then suddenly she put her hand
out and wrung the heart thus. suddenly, the empty drawing-room steps,

attempted, that it "remained for ever," she was going to say, or, for
the words spoken sounded even to herself, too boastful, to hint,
wordlessly; when, looking at the picture, she was surprised to find
that she could not see it. her eyes were full of a hot liquid (she did
not think of tears at first) which, without disturbing the firmness of
her lips, made the air thick, rolled down her cheeks. she had perfect
control of herself--oh, yes!--in every other way. was she crying then
for mrs. ramsay, without being aware of any unhappiness? she addressed
old mr. carmichael again. what was it then? what did it mean? could
things thrust their hands up and grip one; could the blade cut; the
fist grasp? was there no safety? no learning by heart of the ways of
the world? no guide, no shelter, but all was miracle, and leaping from
the pinnacle of a tower into the air? could it be, even for elderly
people, that this was life?--startling, unexpected, unknown? for one

"mrs. ramsay!" lily cried, "mrs. ramsay!" but nothing happened. the pain
increased. that anguish could reduce one to such a pitch of
imbecility, she thought! anyhow the old man had not heard her. he

stop! she had not obviously taken leave of her senses. no one had
seen her step off her strip of board into the waters of annihilation.
she remained a skimpy old maid, holding a paint-brush.

and now slowly the pain of the want, and the bitter anger (to be called
back, just as she thought she would never feel sorrow for mrs. ramsay
again. had she missed her among the coffee cups at breakfast? not in
the least) lessened; and of their anguish left, as antidote, a relief
that was balm in itself, and also, but more mysteriously, a sense of
some one there, of mrs. ramsay, relieved for a moment of the weight that
the world had put on her, staying lightly by her side and then (for
this was mrs. ramsay in all her beauty) raising to her forehead a wreath
of white flowers with which she went. lily squeezed her tubes again.

waked her, required and got in the end an effort of attention, so that
the vision must be perpetually remade. now again, moved as she was by
some instinctive need of distance and blue, she looked at the bay
beneath her, making hillocks of the blue bars of the waves, and
stony fields of the purpler spaces, again she was roused as usual by
something incongruous. there was a brown spot in the middle of the
bay. it was a boat. yes, she realised that after a second. but whose
boat? mr. ramsay's boat, she replied. mr. ramsay; the man who had
marched past her, with his hand raised, aloof, at the head of a
procession, in his beautiful boots, asking her for sympathy, which
she had refused. the boat was now half way across the bay.

so fine was the morning except for a streak of wind here and there that
the sea and sky looked all one fabric, as if sails were stuck high up
in the sky, or the clouds had dropped down into the sea. a steamer far
out at sea had drawn in the air a great scroll

a stop, flapping about waiting for a breeze, in the hot sun, miles from
shore, miles from the lighthouse. everything in the whole world seemed
to stand still. the lighthouse became immovable, and the line of the
distant shore became fixed. the sun grew hotter and everybody seemed
to come very close together and to feel each other's presence, which
they had almost forgotten. macalister's fishing line went plumb down
into the sea. but mr. ramsay went on reading with his legs curled under
him.

he was reading a little shiny book with covers mottled like a plover's
egg. now and again, as they hung about in that horrid calm, he turned
a page. and james felt that each page was turned with a peculiar
gesture aimed at him; now assertively, now commandingly; now with the
intention of making people pity him; and all the time, as his father
read and turned one after another of those little pages, james kept
dreading the moment when he would loo

she had gone stiff all over, and then, her arm slackening, so that he
felt she listened to him no longer, she had risen somehow and gone away
and left him there, impotent, ridiculous, sitting on the floor grasping
a pair of scissors.

not a breath of wind blew. the water chuckled and gurgled in the
bottom of the boat where three or four mackerel beat their tails up and
down in a pool of water not deep enough to cover them. at any moment
mr. ramsay (he scarcely dared look at him) might rouse himself, shut his
book, and say something sharp; but for the moment he was reading, so
that james stealthily, as if he were stealing downstairs on bare feet,
afraid of waking a watchdog by a creaking board, went on thinking what
was she like, where did she go that day? he began following her from
room to room and at last they came to a room where in a blue light, as
if the reflection came from many china dishes, she talked to somebody;

so much depends then, thought lily briscoe, looking at the sea which
had scarcely a stain on it, which was so soft that the sails and the
clouds seemed set in its blue, so much depends, she thought, upon
distance: whether people are near us or far from us; for her feeling
for mr. ramsay changed as he sailed further and further across the bay.
it seemed to be elongated, stretched out; he seemed to become more and
more remote. he and his children seemed to be swallowed up in that
blue, that distance; but here, on the lawn, close at hand, mr.
carmichael suddenly grunted. she laughed. he clawed his book up from
the grass. he settled into his chair again puffing and blowing like
some sea monster. that was different altogether, because he was so
near. and now again all was quiet. th

not speak at all. one glided, one shook one's sails (there was a good
deal of movement in the bay, boats were starting off) between things,
beyond things. empty it was not, but full to the brim. she seemed to
be standing up to the lips in some substance, to move and float and
sink in it, yes, for these waters were unfathomably deep. into them
had spilled so many lives. the ramsays'; the children's; and all sorts
of waifs and strays of things besides. a washer-woman with her basket;
a rook, a red-hot poker; the purples and grey-greens of flowers: some
common feeling which held the whole together.

it was some such feeling of completeness perhaps which, ten years ago,
standing almost where she stood now, had made her say that she must be
in love with the place. love had a thousand shapes. there might be

her eyes rested on the brown speck of mr. ramsay's sailing boat. they
would be at the lighthouse by lunch time she supposed. but the wind
had freshened, and, as the sky changed slightly and the sea changed
slightly and the boats altered their positions, the view, which a
moment before had seemed miraculously fixed, was now unsatisfactory.
the wind had blown the trail of smoke about; there was something
displeasing about the placing of the ships.

s. it was confirmed when she turned to her
picture. she had been wasting her morning. for whatever reason she
could not achieve that razor edge of balance between two opposite
forces; mr. ramsay and the picture; which was necessary. there was
something perhaps wrong with the design? was it, she wondered, that
the line of the wall wanted breaking, was it that the mass of the trees
was too heavy? she smiled ironically; for had she not thought, when
she began, that she had solved her problem?

what was the problem then? she must try to get hold of something tht

her now when she thought of her picture. phrases came. visio

d, smiling at the slipper that dangled from his foot, he was
growing famous. people said that his poetry was "so beautiful." they
went and published things he had written forty years ago. there was a
famous man now called carmichael, she smiled, thinking how many shapes
one person might wear, how he was that in the newspapers, but here the
same as he had always been. he looked the same--greyer, rather.
yes, he looked the same, but somebody had said, she recalled, that when
he had heard of andrew ramsay's death (he was killed in a second by a
shell; he should have been a great mathematician) mr. carmichael had
"lost all interest in life." what did it mean--that? she wondered. had
he marched through trafalgar square grasping a big stick? had he
turned pages over and over, without reading them, sitting in his room
in st. john's wood alone? she did not know what he had done, when he
heard that andrew was killed, but she felt it in him all the same.

she thought that she knew how it went though, slowly and sonorously.
it was seasoned and mellow. it was about the desert and the camel. it
was about the palm tree and the sunset. it was extremely impersonal;
it said something about death; it said very little about love. there
was an impersonality about him. he wanted very little of other people.
had he not always lurched rather awkwardly past the drawing-room window
with some newspaper under his arm, trying to avoid mrs. ramsay whom for
some reason he did not much like? on that account, of course, she
would always try to make him stop. he would bow to her. he would halt
unwillingly and bow profoundly. annoyed that he did not want anything
of her, mrs. ramsay would ask him (lily could hear her) wouldn't he like
a coat, a rug, a newspaper? no, he wanted nothing. (here he bowed.)
there was some quality in her which he did not much like. it was
perhaps her masterfulness, her positiveness, something matter-of-fact
in her.

she was so direct.

(a noise drew her attention to the drawing-room window--the squeak of a
hinge. the light breeze was toying with the window.)

there must have been people who disliked her very much, lily thought
(yes; she realised that the drawing-room step was empty, but it had no
effect on her whatever. she did not want mrs. ramsay now.)--people who
thought her too sure, too drastic.

also, her beauty offended people probably. how monotonous, they would
say, and the same always! they preferred another type--the dark, the
vivacious. then she was weak with her husband. she let him make those
scenes. then she was reserved. nobody knew exactly what had happened
to her. and (to go back to mr. carmichael and his dislike) one could not
imagine mrs. ramsay standing painting, lying reading, a whole morning on
the lawn. it was unth

her errand a basket on her arm, she went off to the town, to the poor,
to sit in some stuffy little bedroom. often and often lily had seen
her go silently in the midst of some game, some discussion, with her
basket on her arm, very upright. she had noted her return. she had
thought, half laughing (she was so methodical with the tea cups), half
moved (her beauty took one's breath away), eyes that are closing in
pain have looked on you. you have been with them there.

and then mrs. ramsay would be annoyed because somebody was late, or the
butter not fresh, or the teapot chipped. and all the time she was
saying that the butter was not fresh one would be thinking of greek
temples, and how beauty had been with them there in that stuffy little
room. she never talked of it--she went, punctually, directly. it was
her instinct to go, an instinct like the swallows for the south, the
artichokes for the sun, turning her infallibly to the human race,
making her nest in its heart. and this,

collar, as if afraid to sanction such exaggeration, but could stand it
in her whom he liked, and smiled very charmingly. he must have
confided in her on one of those long expeditions when people got
separated and walked back alone. he was educating his little sister,
mrs. ramsay had told her. it was immensely to his credit. her own idea
of him was grotesque, lily knew well, stirring the plantains with her
brush. half one's notions of other people were, after all, grotesque.
they served private purposes of one's own. he did for her instead of a
whipping-boy. she found herself flagellating his lean flanks when she
was out of temper. if she wanted to be serious about him she had to
help herself to mrs. ramsay's sayings, to look at him through her eyes.

most some secret sense, fine as air, with which to steal through
keyholes and surround her where she sat knitting, talking, sitting
silent in the window alone; which took to itself and treasured up like
the air which held the smoke of the steamer, her thoughts, her
imaginations, her desires. what did the hedge mean to her, what did
the garden mean to her, what did it mean to her when a wave broke?
(lily looked up, as she had seen mrs. ramsay look up; she too heard a
wave falling on the beach.) and then what stirred and trembled in her
mind when the children cried, "how's that? how's that?" cricketing?
she would stop knitting for a second. she would look intent. then she
would lapse again, and suddenly mr. ramsay stopped dead in his pacing in
front of her and some curious shock passed through her and seemed to
rock her in profound agitation on its breast when stopping there he
stood over her and looked down at her. lily could see hi

he stretched out his hand and raised her from her chair. it seemed
somehow as if he had done it before; as if he had once bent in the same
way and raised her from a boat which, lying a few inches off some
island, had required that the ladies should thus be helped on shore by
the gentlemen. an old-fashioned scene that was, which required,
very nearly, crinolines and peg-top trousers. letting herself be
helped by him, mrs. ramsay had thought (lily supposed) the time
has come now. yes, she would say it now. yes, she would marry him.
and she stepped slowly, quietly on shore. probably she said one
word only, letting her hand rest still in his. i will marry you,
she might have said, with her hand in his; but no more. time
after time the same thrill had passed between them--obviously it
had, lily thought, smoothing a way for her ants. she was not

would slam violently early in the morning. he would start from the
table in a temper. he would whizz his plate through the window. then
all through the house there would be a sense of doors slamming and
blinds fluttering, as if a gusty wind were blowing and people scudded
about trying in a hasty way to fasten hatches and make things ship-
shape. she had met paul rayley like that one day on the stairs.
they had laughed and laughed, like a couple of children, all because
mr. ramsay, finding an earwig in his milk at breakfast had sent the
whole thing flying through the air on to the terrace outside. 'an earwig,
prue murmured, awestruck, 'in his milk.' other people might find
centipedes. but he had built round him such a fence of sanctity, and
occupied the space with such a demeanour of majesty that an earwig
in his milk was a monster.

but it tired mrs. ramsay, it cowed her a little--the plates whizzing
and the doors slamming. and there would fall between them sometimes

"why don't some of you take up botany?.. with all those legs and arms
why doesn't one of you...?" so they would talk as usual, laughing,
among the children. all would be as usual, save only for some quiver,
as of a blade in the air, which came and went between them as if
the usual sight of the children sitting round their soup plates
had freshened itself in their eyes after that hour among the pears and
the cabbages. especially, lily thought, mrs. ramsay would glance at
prue. she sat in the middle between brothers and sisters, always
occupied, it seemed, seeing that nothing went wrong so that she
scarcely spoke herself. how prue must have blamed herself for that
earwig in the milk how white she had gone when mr. ramsay threw his
plate through the window! how she drooped under those long silences
between them! anyhow, her mother now would seem to be making it up to
her; assuring her that everything was well; promising her that one of

she let her flowers fall from her basket, scattered and tumbled them on
to the grass and, reluctantly and hesitatingly, but without question or
complaint--had she not the faculty of obedience to perfection?--went
too. down fields, across valleys, white, flower-strewn--that was
how she would have painted it. the hills were austere. it was rocky;
it was steep. the waves sounded hoarse on the stones beneath. they
went, the three of them together, mrs. ramsay walking rather fast in
front, as if she expected to meet some one round the corner.

suddenly the window at which she was looking was whitened by some light
stuff behind it. at last then somebody had come into the drawing-room;
somebody was sitting in the chair. for heaven's sake, she prayed, let
them sit still there and not come floundering out to talk to her.
mercifully, whoever it was stayed still inside; had settled by some
stroke of luck so as to throw an odd-shaped triangular shadow over

be on a level with ordinary experience, to feel simply that's a chair,
that's a table, and yet at the same time, it's a miracle, it's an
ecstasy. the problem might be solved after all. ah, but what had
happened? some wave of white went over the window pane. the air must
have stirred some flounce in the room. her heart leapt at her and
seized her and tortured her.

"mrs. ramsay! mrs. ramsay!" she cried, feeling the old horror come
back--to want and want and not to have. could she inflict that still?
and then, quietly, as if she refrained, that too became part of
ordinary experience, was on a level with the chair, with the table.
mrs. ramsay--it was part of her perfect goodness--sat there quite
simply, in the chair, flicked her needles to and fro, knitted her
reddish-brown stocking, cast her shadow on the step. there she sat.

mr. ramsay had almost done reading. one hand hovered over the page as
if to be in readiness to turn it the very instant he had finished it.
he sat there bareheaded with the wind blowing his hair about,
extraordinarily exposed to everything. he looked very old. he looked,
james thought, getting his head now against the lighthouse, now against
the waste of waters running away into the open, like some old stone
lying on the sand; he looked as if he had become physically what was

se innumberable things. but as, just before sleep, things
simplify themselves so that only one of all the myriad details has
power to assert itself, so, she felt, looking drowsily at the island,
all those paths and terraces and bedrooms were fading and disappearing,
and nothing was left but a pale blue censer swinging rhythmically this
way and that across her mind. it was a hanging garden; it was a
valley, full of birds, and flowers, and antelopes... she was falling
asleep.

"come now," said mr. ramsay, suddenly shutting his book.

come where? to what extraordinary adventure? she woke with a start.
to land somewhere, to climb somewhere? where was he leading them? for
after his immense silence the words startled them. but it was absurd.
he was hungry, he said. it was time for lunch. besides, look, he
said. "there's the lighthouse. we're almost there."

"he's doing very well," said macalister, praising james. "he's keeping
her very steady."

mr. ramsay opened the parcel and shared out the sandwiches among them.
now he was happy, eating bread and cheese with these fishermen. he
would have liked to live in a cottage and lounge about in the harbour
spitting with the other old men, james thought, watching him slice his
cheese into thin yellow sheets with his penknife.

at the same time they were sailing so fast along by the rocks that it
was very exciting--it seemed as if they were doing two things at once;
they were eating their lunch here in the sun and they were also making
for safety in a great storm after a shipwreck. would the water last?
would the provisions last? she asked herself, telling herself a story
but knowing at the same time what was the truth.

they would soon be out of it, mr. ramsay was saying to old macalister;
but their children would see some strange things. macalister said he
was seventy-five last march; mr. ramsay was seventy-one. macalister said
he had never seen a doctor; he had never lost a tooth. and that's the
way i'd like my children to live--cam was sure that her father was
thinking that, for he stopped her throwing a sandwich into the sea and
told her, as if he were thinking of the fishermen and how they lived,
that if she did not want it she should put it bac
