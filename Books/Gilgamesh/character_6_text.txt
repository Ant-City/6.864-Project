	"aruru washed her hands, broke off clay,
	threw it on the field [103]
	... created enkidu, the hero, a lofty
	offspring of the host of ninib." [104]


the description of enkidu follows, with his body covered with hair
like an animal, and eating and drinking with the animals. there
follows an episode [105] which has no connection whatsoever with
the gilgamesh epic, but which is clearly intended to illustrate how
enkidu came to abandon the life with the animals. a hunter sees enkidu
and is amazed at the strange sight--an animal and yet a man. enkidu,
as though resenting his condition, becomes enraged at the sight of
the hunter, and the latter goes to his father and tells him of the
strange creature whom he is unable to catch. in reply, the father
advises his son to take a woman with him when next he goes out on
his pursuit, and to have the woman remove her dress in the presence
of enkidu, who will then approach her, and after intercourse with
her will a

bandon the animals among whom he lives. by this device he
will catch the strange creature. lines 14-18 of column 3 in the first
tablet in which the father of the hunter refers to gilgamesh must be
regarded as a later insertion, a part of the reconstruction of the
tale to connect the episode with gilgamesh. the advice of the father
to his son, the hunter, begins, line 19,


	"go my hunter, take with thee a woman."


in the reconstructed tale, the father tells his son to go to gilgamesh
to relate to him the strange appearance of the animal-man; but there
is clearly no purpose in this, as is shown by the fact that when the
hunter does so, gilgamesh makes _precisely the same speech_ as does
the father of the hunter. lines 40-44 of column 3, in which gilgamesh
is represented as speaking to the hunter form a complete _doublet_
to lines 19-24, beginning


	"go, my hunter,

take with thee a woman, etc."


and similarly the description of enkidu appears twice, lines 2-12
in an address of the hunter to his father, and lines 29-39 in the
address of the hunter to gilgamesh.

the artificiality of the process of introducing gilgamesh into
the episode is revealed by this awkward and entirely meaningless
repetition. we may therefore reconstruct the first two scenes in the
enkidu epic as follows: [106]

tablet i, col. 2, 34-35: creation of enkidu by aruru.

36-41: description of enkidu's hairy body and of his life with the
animals.

42-50: the hunter sees enkidu, who shows his anger, as also his woe,
at his condition.

3, 1-12: the hunter t

ells his father of the strange being who pulls
up the traps which the hunter digs, and who tears the nets so that
the hunter is unable to catch him or the animals.

19-24: the father of the hunter advises his son on his next expedition
to take a woman with him in order to lure the strange being from his
life with the animals.

line 25, beginning "on the advice of his father," must have set forth,
in the original form of the episode, how the hunter procured the
woman and took her with him to meet enkidu.

column 4 gives in detail the meeting between the two, and naïvely
describes how the woman exposes her charms to enkidu, who is captivated
by her and stays with her six days and seven nights. the animals see
the change in enkidu and run away from him. he has been transformed
through the woman. so far the episode. in the assyrian version there
follows an address of the woman to enkidu beginning (col. 4, 34):

the designation "nimrod epic" on the supposition that the hero of
the babylonian epic is identical with nimrod, the "mighty hunter"
of genesis 10, has now been generally abandoned, in the absence of
any evidence that the babylonian hero bore a name like nimrod. for
all that, the description of nimrod as the "mighty hunter" and the
occurrence of a "hunter" in the babylonian epic (assyrian version
tablet i)--though he is not the hero--points to a confusion in
the hebrew form of the borrowed tradition between gilgamesh and
nimrod. the latest french translation of the epic is by dhorme,

[111] that in the combination of this enkidu with tales of primitive
man, inconsistent features should have been introduced, such as the
union of enkidu with the woman as the beginning of a higher life,
whereas the presence of a hunter and his father shows that human
society was already in existence, is characteristic of folk-tales,
which are indifferent to details that may be contradictory to the
general setting of the story.
