algernon.  did you hear what i was playing, lane?

lane.  i didn’t think it polite to listen, sir.

algernon.  i’m sorry for that, for your sake.  i don’t play accurately—any one can play accurately—but i play with wonderful expression.  as far as the piano is concerned, sentiment is my forte.  i keep science for life.

lane.  yes, sir.

algernon.  and, speaking of the science of life, have you got the cucumber sandwiches cut for lady bracknell?

lane.  yes, sir.  [hands them on a salver.]

algernon.  [inspects them, takes two, and sits down on the sofa.]  oh! . . . by the way, lane, i see from your book that on thursday night, when lord shoreman and mr. worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of champagne are entered as having been consumed.

lane.  yes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.

algernon.  why is it that at a bachelor’s establishment the servants invariably drink the champagne?  i ask merely for information.

jack.  i suppose so, if you want to.

algernon.  yes, but you must be serious about it.  i hate people who are not serious about meals.  it is so shallow of them.

lady bracknell.  good afternoon, dear algernon, i hope you are behaving very well.

algernon.  i’m feeling very well, aunt augusta.

lady bracknell.  that’s not quite the same thing.  in fact the two things rarely go together.  [sees jack and bows to him with icy coldness.]

gwendolen.  i am always smart!  am i not, mr. worthing?

lady bracknell.  i’m sorry if we are a little late, algernon, but i was obliged to call on dear lady harbury.  i hadn’t been there since her poor husband’s death.  i never saw a woman so altered; she looks quite twenty years younger.  and now i’ll have a cup of tea, and one of those nice cucumber sandwiches you promised me.

algernon.  certainly, aunt augusta.  [goes over to tea-table.]

lady bracknell.  won’t you come and sit here, gwendolen?

gwendolen.  thanks, mamma, i’m quite comfortable wher

algernon.  [picking up empty plate in horror.]  good heavens!  lane!  why are there no cucumber sandwiches?  i ordered them specially.

lane.  [gravely.]  there were no cucumbers in the market this morning, sir.  i went down twice.

algernon.  no cucumbers!

lane.  no, sir.  not even for ready money.

algernon.  that will do, lane, thank you.

lane.  thank you, sir.  [goes out.]

algernon.  i am greatly distressed, aunt augusta, about there being no cucumbers, not even for ready money.

lady bracknell.  it really makes no matter, algernon.  i had some crumpets with lady harbury, who seems to me to be living entirely for pleasure now.

algernon.  i hear her hair has turned quite gold from grief.

lady bracknell.  it certainly has changed its colour.  from what cause i, of course, cannot say.  [algernon crosses and hands tea.]  thank you.  i’ve quite a treat for you to-night, algernon.  i am going to send you down with mary farquhar.  she is such a nice woman, and so attentive to her husband

algernon.  i am afraid, aunt augusta, i shall have to give up the pleasure of dining with you to-night after all.

lady bracknell.  [frowning.]  i hope not, algernon.  it would put my table completely out.  your uncle would have to dine upstairs.  fortunately he is accustomed to that.

algernon.  it is a great bore, and, i need hardly say, a terrible disappointment to me, but the fact is i have just had a telegram to say that my poor friend bunbury is very ill again.  [exchanges glances with jack.]  they seem to think i should be with him.

lady bracknell.  it is very strange.  this mr. bunbury seems to suffer from curiou

algernon.  yes; poor bunbury is a dreadful invalid.

lady bracknell.  well, i must say, algernon, that i think it is high time that mr. bunbury made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die.  this shilly-shallying with the question is absurd.  nor do i in any way approve of the modern sympathy with invalids.  i consider it morbid.  illness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others.  health is the primary duty of life.  i am always telling that to your poor uncle, but he never seems to take much notice . . . as far as any improvement in

algernon.  i’ll speak to bunbury, aunt augusta, if he is still conscious, and i think i can promise you he’ll be all right by saturday.  of course the music is a great difficulty.  you see, if one plays good music, people don’t listen, and if one plays bad music people don’t talk.  but i’ll run over the programme i’ve drawn out, if you will kindly come into the next room for a moment.

lady bracknell.  thank you, algernon.  it is very thoughtful of you.  [rising, and following algernon.]  i’m sure the programme will be delightful, after a few expurgations.  french songs i cannot possibly allow.  people always seem to think that they are improper, and either look shocked, which is vulgar, or laugh, which is worse.  but german sounds a thoroughly respectable language, and indeed, i believe is so.  gwendolen, you will accompany me.

gwendolen.  certainly, mamma.

jack.  charming day it has been, miss fairfax.

gwendolen.  pray don’t talk to me about the weather, mr. worthing.  whenever people talk to me about the weather, i always feel quite certain that they mean something else.  and that makes me so nervous.

jack.  i do mean something else.

gwendolen.  i thought so.  in fact, i am never wrong.

jack.  and i would like to be allowed to take advantage of lady bracknell’s temporary absence . . .

gwendolen.  i would certainly advise you to do so.  mamma has a way of coming back suddenly into a room that i have often had to speak to her about.

jack.  [nervously.]  miss fairfax, ever since i met you i have admired you more than any girl . . . i have ever met since . . . i met you.

gwendolen.  yes, but men often propose for practice.  i know my brother gerald does.  all my girl-friends tell me so.  what wonderfully blue eyes you have, ernest!  they are quite, quite, blue.  i hope you will always look at me just like that, especially when there are other people present.

lady bracknell.  mr. worthing!  rise, sir, from this semi-recumbent posture.  it is most indecorous.

gwendolen.  mamma!  [he tries to rise; she restrains him.]  i must beg you to retire.  this is no place for you.  besides, mr. worthing has not quite finished yet.

lady bracknell.  finished what, may i ask?

gwendolen.  i am engaged to mr. worthing, mamma.  [they rise together.]

lady bracknell.  pardon me, you are not engaged to any one.  when you do become engaged to some one, i, or your

jack.  well, yes, i must admit i smoke.

lady bracknell.  i am glad to hear it.  a man should always have an occupation of some kind.  there are far too many idle men in london as it is.  how old are you?

jack.  twenty-nine.

lady bracknell.  a very good age to be married at.  i have always been of opinion that a man who desires to get married should know either everything or nothing.  which do you know?

jack.  in investments, chiefly.

lady bracknell.  that is satisfactory.  what between the duties expected of one during one’s lifetime, and the duties exacted from one after one’s death, land has ceased to be either a profit or a pleasure.  it gives one position, and prevents one from keeping it up.  that’s all that can be said about land.

jack.  well, i own a house in belgrave square, but it is let by the year to lady bloxham.  of course, i can get it back whenever i like, at six months’ notice.

jack.  do you mean the fashion, or the side?

lady bracknell.  [sternly.]  both, if necessary, i presume.  what are your politics?

jack.  well, i am afraid i really have none.  i am a liberal unionist.

lady bracknell.  oh, they count as tories.  they dine with us.  or come in the evening, at any rate.  now to minor matters.  are your parents living?

jack.  i have lost both my parents.

lady bracknell.  to lose one parent, mr. worthing, may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness.  who was your father?  he was evidently a man

jack.  i am afraid i really don’t know.  the fact is, lady bracknell, i said i had lost my parents.  it would be nearer the truth to say that my parents seem to have lost me . . . i don’t actually know who i am by birth.  i was . . . well, i was found.

lady bracknell.  found!

jack.  the late mr. thomas cardew, an old gentleman of a very charitable and kindly disposition, found me, and gave me the name of worthing, because he happened to have a first-class ticket for worthing in his pocket at the time.  worthing is a place in sussex.  it is a seaside resort.

lady bracknell.  where did the charitable gentleman who had a first-class ticket for this seaside resort find you?

jack.  [gravely.]  in a hand-bag.

lady bracknell.  a hand-bag?

jack.  [very serious

lady bracknell.  in what locality did this mr. james, or thomas, cardew come across this ordinary hand-bag?

jack.  in the cloak-room at victoria station.  it was given to him in mistake for his own.

lady bracknell.  the cloak-room at victoria station?

jack.  yes.  the brighton line.

lady bracknell.  the line is immaterial.  mr. worthing, i confess i feel somewhat bewildered by what you have just told me.  to be born, or at any rate bred, in a hand-bag, whether it had handles or not, seems to me to display a contempt for the ordinary decencies of family life that reminds one of the worst excesses of the french revolution.  and i presume you know what that unfortunate movement led to?  as for the particular locality in which the hand-bag was found, a cloak-room at a railway station might s

jack.  may i ask you then what you would advise me to do?  i need hardly say i would do anything in the world to ensure gwendolen’s happiness.

lady bracknell.  i would strongly advise you, mr. worthing, to try and acquire some relations as soon as possible, and to make a definite effort to produce at any rate one parent, of either sex, before the season is quite over.

jack.  well, i don’t see how i could possibly manage to do that.  i can produce the hand-bag at any moment.  it is in my dressing-room at home.  i really think that should satisfy you, lady bracknell.

algernon.  my dear boy, i love hearing my relations abused.  it is the only thing that makes me put up with them at all.  relations are simply a tedious pack of people, who haven’t got the remotest knowledge of how to live, nor the smallest instinct about when to die.

lady bracknell.  exploded!  was he the victim of a revolutionary outrage?  i was not aware that mr. bunbury was interested in social legislation.  if so, he is well punished for his morbidity.

algernon.  my dear aunt augusta, i mean he was found out!  the doctors found out that bunbury could not live, that is what i mean—so bunbury died.

lady bracknell.  he seems to have had great confidence in the opinion of his physicians.  i am glad, however, that he made up his mind at the last to some definite course of action, and acted under proper medical advice.  and now that we have finally got rid of this mr. bunbury, may i ask, mr. worthing, who is that young person whose hand my nephew algernon is now holding in what seems to me a peculiarly unnecessary manner?

jack.  that lady is miss cecily cardew, my ward.  [lady bracknell bows coldly to ceci

lady bracknell.  that sounds not unsatisfactory.  three addresses always inspire confidence, even in tradesmen.  but what proof have i of their authenticity?

jack.  i have carefully preserved the court guides of the period.  they are open to your inspection, lady bracknell.

lady bracknell.  [grimly.]  i have known strange errors in that publication.

jack.  miss cardew’s family solicitors are messrs. markby, markby, and markby.

lady bracknell.  ah! a life crowded with incident, i see; though perhaps somewhat too exciting for a young girl.  i am not myself in favour of premature experiences.  [rises, looks at her watch.]  gwendolen! the time approaches for our departure.  we have not a moment to lose.  as a matter of form, mr. worthing, i had better ask you if miss cardew has any little fortune?

lady bracknell.  never speak disrespectfully of society, algernon.  only people who can’t get into it do that.  [to cecily.]  dear child, of course you know that algernon has nothing but his debts to depend upon.  but i do not approve of mercenary marriages.  when i married lord bracknell i had no fortune of any kind.  but i never dreamed for a moment of allowing that to stand in my way.  well, i suppose i must give my consent.

algernon.  thank you, aunt augusta.

lady bracknell.  cecily, you may kiss me!

algernon.  thank you, aunt augusta.

cecily.  thank you, aunt augusta.

lady bracknell.  to speak frankly, i am not in favour of long engagements.  they give people the opportunity of finding out each other’s character before marriage, which i think is never advisable.

jack.  i beg your pardon for interrupting you, lady bracknell, but this engagement is quite out of the question.  i am miss cardew’s guardian, and she cannot marry without my consent until she comes of age.  that consent i absolutely decline to give.

lady bracknell.  upon what grounds may i ask?  algernon is

an extremely, i may almost say an ostentatiously, eligible young man.  he has nothing, but he looks everything.  what more can one desire?

jack.  it pains me very much to have to speak frankly to you, lady bracknell, about your nephew, but the fact is that i do not approve at all of his moral character.  i suspect him of being untruthful.  [algernon and cecily look at him in indignant amazement.]

lady bracknell.  untruthful!  my nephew algernon?  impossible!  he is an oxonian.

jack.  i fear there can be no possible doubt about the matter.  this afternoon during my temporary absence in london on an important question of romance, he obtained admission to my house by means of the false pretence of being my brother.  under an assumed name he drank, i’ve just been informed by my butler, an entire pint bottle of my perrier-jouet, brut, ’89; wine i was specially reserving for myself.  continuing his dis
 
 ___________________________
 
graceful deception, he succeeded in the course of the afternoon in alienating the affections of my only ward.  he subsequently stayed to tea, and devoured every single muffin.  and what makes his conduct all the more heartless is, that he was perfectly well aware from the first that i have no brother, that i never had a brother, and that i don’t intend to have a brother, not even of any kind.  i distinctly told him so myself yesterday afternoon.

lady bracknell.  ahem!  mr. worthing, after careful consideration i have decided entirely to overlook my nephew’s conduct to you.

jack.  that is very generous of you, lady bracknell.  my own decision, however, is unalterable.  i decline to give my consent.

lady bracknell.  [to cecily.]  come here, sweet child.  [cecily goes over.]  how old are you, dear?

cecily.  well, i am really only eighteen, but i always admit to twenty when i go to evening parties.

lady bracknell.  you are perfectly right in making

 some slight alteration.  indeed, no woman should ever be quite accurate about her age.  it looks so calculating . . . [in a meditative manner.]  eighteen, but admitting to twenty at evening parties.  well, it will not be very long before you are of age and free from the restraints of tutelage.  so i don’t think your guardian’s consent is, after all, a matter of any importance.

jack.  pray excuse me, lady bracknell, for interrupting you again, but it is only fair to tell you that according to the terms of her grandfather’s will miss cardew does not come legally of age till she is thirty-five.

lady bracknell.  that does not seem to me to be a grave objection.  thirty-five is a very attractive age.  london society is full of women of the very highest birth who have, of their own free choice, remained thirty-five for years.  lady dumbleton is an instance in point.  to my own knowledge she has been thirty-

cecily.  algy, could you wait for me till i was thirty-five?

algernon.  of course i could, cecily.  you know i could.

cecily.  yes, i felt it instinctively, but i couldn’t wait all that time.  i hate waiting even five minutes for anybody.  it always makes me rather cross.  i am not punctual myself, i know, but i do like punctuality in others, and waiting, even to be married, is quite out of the question.

algernon.  then what is to be done, cecily?

cecily.  i don’t know, mr. moncrieff.

lady bracknell.  my dear mr. worthing, as miss cardew states positively that she cannot wait till she is thirty-five—a remark which i am bound to say seems to me to show a somewhat impatient nature—i would beg of you to reconsider your decision.

jack.  but my dear lady bracknell, the matter is entirely in your own hands.  the moment you consent to my marriage with gwendolen, i will most gladly allow your nephew to form an alliance with my ward.

lady bracknell.  [rising and drawing herself up.]  you must

lady bracknell.  that is not the destiny i propose for gwendolen.  algernon, of course, can choose for himself.  [pulls out her watch.]  come, dear, [gwendolen rises] we have already missed five, if not six, trains.  to miss any more might expose us to comment on the platform.

[enter dr. chasuble.]

chasuble.  everything is quite ready for the christenings.

lady bracknell.  the christenings, sir!  is not that somewhat premature?

chasuble.  [looking rather puzzled, and pointing to jack and algernon.]  both

these gentlemen have expressed a desire for immediate baptism.

lady bracknell.  at their age?  the idea is grotesque and irreligious!  algernon, i forbid you to be baptized.  i will not hear of such excesses.  lord bracknell would be highly displeased if he learned that that was the way in which you wasted your time and money.

chasuble.  am i to understand then that there are to be no christenings at all this afternoon?

jack.  i don’t think that, as things are now, it would be of much practical value to either of us, dr. chasuble.

lady bracknell.  [starting.]  miss prism!  did i hear you mention a miss prism?

chasuble.  yes, lady bracknell.  i am on my way to join her.

lady bracknell.  pray allow me to detain you for a moment.  this matter may prove to be one of vital importance to lord bracknell and myself.  is this miss prism a female of repellent aspect, remotely connected with education?

chasuble.  [somewhat indignantly.]  she is the most cultivated of ladies, and the very picture of respectability.

lady bracknell.  it is obvio

chasuble.  [severely.]  i am a celibate, madam.

jack.  [interposing.]  miss prism, lady bracknell, has been for the last three years miss cardew’s esteemed governess and valued companion.

lady bracknell.  in spite of what i hear of her, i must see her at once.  let her be sent for.

chasuble.  [looking off.]  she approaches; she is nigh.

[enter miss prism hurriedly.]

miss prism.  i was told you expected me in the vestry, dear canon.  i have been waiting for you there for an hour and three-quarters.  [catches sight of lady bracknell, who has fixed her with a stony glare.  miss prism grows pale and quails.  she looks anxiously round as if desirous to escape.]

ained a baby of the male sex.  you never returned.  a few weeks later, through the elaborate investigations of the metropolitan police, the perambulator was discovered at midnight, standing by itself in a remote corner of bayswater.  it contained the manuscript of a three-volume novel of more than usually revolting sentimentality.  [miss prism starts in involuntary indignation.]  but the baby was not there!  [every one looks at miss prism.]  prism!  where is that baby?  [a pause.]

miss prism.  lady bracknell, i admit with shame that i do not know.  i only wish i did.  the plain facts of the case are these.  on the morning of the day you mention, a day that is for ever branded on my memory, i prepared as usual to take the baby out in its perambulator.  i had also with me a somewhat old, but capacious hand-bag in which i had intended to place the manuscript of a work of fiction that i had written during my few unoccupied hours.  in a moment of mental abstraction, for which i never can forgive myself,

ing where you deposited the hand-bag that contained that infant.

miss prism.  i left it in the cloak-room of one of the larger railway stations in london.

jack.  what railway station?

miss prism.  [quite crushed.]  victoria.  the brighton line.  [sinks into a chair.]

jack.  i must retire to my room for a moment.  gwendolen, wait here for me.

gwendolen.  if you are not too long, i will wait here for you all my life.  [exit jack in great excitement.]

chasuble.  what do you think this means, lady bracknell?

lady bracknell.  i dare not even suspect, dr. chasuble.  i need hardly tell you that in families of high position strange coincidences are not supposed to occur.  they are hardly considered the thing.

[noises heard overhead as if some one was throwing trunks about.  every one looks up.]

cecily.  uncle jack seems strangely agitated.

chasuble.  your guardian has a very emotional nature.

lady bracknell.  this noise is extremely unpleasant.  it sounds as if he was having an argument.  i disli

ke arguments of any kind.  they are always vulgar, and often convincing.

chasuble.  [looking up.]  it has stopped now.  [the noise is redoubled.]

lady bracknell.  i wish he would arrive at some conclusion.

gwendolen.  this suspense is terrible.  i hope it will last.  [enter jack with a hand-bag of black leather in his hand.]

jack.  [rushing over to miss prism.]  is this the hand-bag, miss prism?  examine it carefully before you speak.  the happiness of more than one life depends on your answer.

miss prism.  [calmly.]  it seems to be mine.  yes, here is the injury it received through the upsetting of a gower street omnibus in younger and happier days

ng her.]  yes . . . mother!

miss prism.  [recoiling in indignant astonishment.]  mr. worthing!  i am unmarried!

jack.  unmarried!  i do not deny that is a serious blow.  but after all, who has the right to cast a stone against one who has suffered?  cannot repentance wipe out an act of folly?  why should there be one law for men, and another for women?  mother, i forgive you.  [tries to embrace her again.]

miss prism.  [still more indignant.]  mr. worthing, there is some error.  [pointing to lady bracknell.]  there is the lady who can tell you who you really are.

jack.  [after a pause.]  lady bracknell, i hate to seem inquisitive, but would you kindly inform me who i am?

lady bracknell.  i am afraid that the news i have to give you will not altogether please you.  you are the son of my poor sister, mrs. moncrieff, and consequently algernon’s elder brother.

jack.  algy’s elder brother!  then i have a brother after all.  i knew i had a brother!  i always said i had a brother!  cecily,—how

  but what own are you?  what is your christian name, now that you have become some one else?

jack.  good heavens! . . . i had quite forgotten that point.  your decision on the subject of my name is irrevocable, i suppose?

gwendolen.  i never change, except in my affections.

cecily.  what a noble nature you have, gwendolen!

jack.  then the question had better be cleared up at once.  aunt augusta, a moment.  at the time when miss prism left me in the hand-bag, had i been christened already?

lady bracknell.  every luxury that money could buy, including christening, had been lavished on you by your fond and doting parents.

jack.  then i was christened!  that is settled.  now, what name was i given?  let me know the worst.

lady bracknell.  being the eldest son you were naturally christened after your father.

jack.  [irritably.]  yes, but what was my father’s christian name?

lady bracknell.  [meditatively.]  i cannot at the present moment recall what the general’s christian name was.  but i

have no doubt he had one.  he was eccentric, i admit.  but only in later years.  and that was the result of the indian climate, and marriage, and indigestion, and other things of that kind.

jack.  algy!  can’t you recollect what our father’s christian name was?

algernon.  my dear boy, we were never even on speaking terms.  he died before i was a year old.

jack.  his name would appear in the army lists of the period, i suppose, aunt augusta?

lady bracknell.  the general was essentially a man of peace, except in his domestic life.  but i have no doubt his name would appear in any military directory.

jack.  the army lists of the last forty years are here.  these delightful records should have been my constant study.

lady bracknell.  yes, i remember now that the general was called ernest, i knew i had some particular reason for disliking the name.

gwendolen.  ernest!  my own ernest!  i felt from the first that you could have no other name!

jack.  gwendolen, it is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that all his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth.  can you forgive me?

gwendolen.  i can.  for i feel that you are sure to change.

jack.  my own one!
