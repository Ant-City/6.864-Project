"alas!" said the other, "it was love; love, the comfort of the human species, the preserver of the universe, the soul of all sensible beings, love, tender love."[pg 15]

"alas!" said candide, "i know this love, that sovereign of hearts, that soul of our souls; yet it never cost me more than a kiss and twenty kicks on the backside. how could this beautiful cause produce in you an effect so abominable?"

pangloss made answer in these terms: "oh, my dear candide, you remember paquette, that pretty wench who waited on our noble baroness; in her arms i tasted the delights of paradise, which produced in me those hell torments with which you see me devoured; she was infected with them, she is perhaps dead of them. this present paquette received of a learned grey friar, who had traced it to its source; he had had it of an old countess, who had received it from a cavalry captain, who owed it to a marchioness, who took it from a page, who had received it from a jesuit, who when a n

the skipper was ready in two days. they[pg 124] coasted france; they passed in sight of lisbon, and candide trembled. they passed through the straits, and entered the mediterranean. at last they landed at venice.

"god be praised!" said candide, embracing martin. "it is here that i shall see again my beautiful cunegonde. i trust cacambo as myself. all is well, all will be well, all goes as well as possible."[pg 125]

of paquette and friar giroflée.

upon their arrival at venice, candide went to search for cacambo at every inn and coffee-house, and among all the ladies of pleasure, but to no purpose. he sent every day to inquire on all the ships that came in. but there was no news of cacambo.

"what!" said he to martin, "i have had time to voyage from surinam to bordeaux, to go from bordeaux to paris, from paris to dieppe, from dieppe to portsmouth, to coast along portugal and spain, to cross the whole mediterranean, t

r i am mistaken."

immediately he accosted them, presented his compliments, and invited them to his inn to eat some macaroni, with lombard partridges, and caviare, and to drink some montepulciano, lachrymæ christi, cyprus and samos wine. the girl blushed, the theatin accepted the invitation and she followed him, casting her eyes on candide with confusion and surprise, and dropping a few tears. no sooner had she set foot in candide's apartment than she cried out:

"ah! mr. candide does not know paquette again."

candide had not viewed her as yet with attention, his thoughts being entirely taken up with cunegonde; but recollecting her as she spoke.

"alas!" said he, "my poor child, it is you who reduced doctor pangloss to the beautiful condition in which i saw him?"

"alas! it was i, sir, indeed," answered paquette. "i see that you have heard all. i have been informed of the frightful disasters that befell the family of my lady baroness, and[pg 128] the fair cunegonde. i swear to you that my fa

paquette thus opened her heart to honest candide, in the presence of martin, who said to his friend:

"you see that already i have won half the wager."

friar giroflée stayed in the dining-room, and drank a glass or two of wine while he was waiting for dinner.

"but," said candide to paquette, "you looked so gay and content when i met you; you sang and you behaved so lovingly to the theatin, that you seemed to me as happy as you pretend to be now the reverse."

"ah! sir," answered paquette, "this is on

candide wanted no more convincing; he owned that martin was in the right. they sat down to table with paquette and the theatin; the repast was entertaining; and towards the end they conversed with all confidence.

"father," said candide to the friar, "you appear to me to enjoy a state that all the world might envy; the flower of health shines in your face, your expression makes plain your happiness; you have a very pretty girl for your recreation, and you seem well satisfied with your state as a theatin."

"my faith, sir," said friar giroflée, "i wish that all the theatins were at the bottom of the sea

martin turned towards candide with his usual coolness.

"well," said he, "have i not won the whole wager?"

candide gave two thousand piastres to paquette, and one thousand to friar giroflée.

"i'll answer for it," said he, "that with this they will be happy."

"i do not believe it at all," said martin; "you will, perhaps, with these piastres only render them the more unhappy."

"let that be as it may," said candide, "but one thing consoles me. i see that we often meet with those whom we expected never to see more; so that, perhaps, as i have found my red sheep and paquette, it may well be that i shall also find cunegonde."

"that is to say," replied martin, "that there is some pleasure in having no pleasure."

"well, well," said candide, "i find that i shall be the only happy man when i am blessed with the sight of my dear cunegonde."

"it is always well to hope," said martin.

however, the days and the weeks passed. cacambo did not come, and candide was so overwhelmed with grief that he did not even reflect that paquette and friar giroflée did not return to thank him.[pg 142]

of a supper which candide and martin took with six strangers, and who they were.[34]

one evening that candide and martin were going to sit down to supper with some foreigners who lodged in the same inn, a man whose complexion was as black as soot, came behind candide, and taking him by the arm, said:

"get yourself ready to go along with us; do not fail."

upon this he turned round and saw—cacambo! nothing but the sight of cuneg

 especially concluded that man was born to live either in a state of distracting inquietude or of lethargic disgust. candide did not quite agree to that, but he affirmed nothing. pangloss owned that he had always suffered horribly, but as he had once asserted that everything went wonderfully well, he asserted it still, though he no longer believed it.

what helped to confirm martin in his detestable principles, to stagger candide more than ever, and to puzzle pangloss, was that one day they saw paquette and friar giroflée land at the farm in extreme misery. they had soon squandered their three thousand piastres, parted, were reconciled, quarrelled again, were thrown[pg 164] into gaol, had escaped, and friar giroflée had at length become turk. paquette continued her trade wherever she went, but made nothing of it.

"i foresaw," said martin to candide, "that your presents would soon be dissipated, and only make them the more miserable. you have rolled in millions of money, you and cacambo; and

 yet you are not happier than friar giroflée and paquette."

"ha!" said pangloss to paquette, "providence has then brought you amongst us again, my poor child! do you know that you cost me the tip of my nose, an eye, and an ear, as you may see? what a world is this!"

and now this new adventure set them philosophising more than ever.

in the neighbourhood there lived a very famous dervish who was esteemed the best philosopher in all turkey, and they went to consult him. pangloss was the speaker.

"master," said he, "we come to beg you to tell why so strange an animal as man was made."

d pangloss, "for when man was first placed in the garden of eden, he was put there ut operaretur eum, that he might cultivate it; which shows that man was not born to be idle."

"let us work," said martin, "without disputing; it is the only way to render life tolerable."

the whole little society entered into this laudable design, according to their different abilities. their little plot of land produced plentiful crops. cunegonde was, indeed, very ugly, but she became an excellent pastry cook; paquette worked at embroidery; the old woman looked after the[pg 168] linen. they were all, not excepting friar giroflée, of some service or other; for he made a good joiner, and became a very honest man.

pangloss sometimes said to candide:

"there is a concatenation of events in this best of all possible worlds: for if you had not been kicked out of a magnificent castle for love of miss cunegonde: if you had not been put into the inquisition: if you had not walked over america: if you had not stabbed
