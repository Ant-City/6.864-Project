e owsla have to keep very strong
and tough. they take it in turn to do what they call wide patrol. they go out over
the country -- all round the place -- living in the open for days at a time. it's partly
to find out anything they can, and partly to train them and make them tough and
cunning. any hlessil they find they pick up and bring back to efrafa. if they won't
come, they kill them. they reckon hlessil a danger, because they may attract the
attention of men. the wide patrols report back to general woundwort, and the
council decide what to do about anything new that they think may be dangerous."
     "they missed you on the way in, then?" said bluebell.
     "oh, no, they didn't! we learned later that some time after we'd been brought
in by this rabbit -- captain campion -- a runner arrived from a wide patrol to say
that they'd picked up the track of three or four rabbits coming toward efrafa from
the north, and were there any orders? he was sent back to say that we were safely
under control.

all we heard the poor fellow trying to explain himself, and then he was crying and
begging for mercy: and when he came out they'd ripped both his ears to shreds,
worse than this one of mine. we were all sniffing at him, absolutely horror-
stricken; but one of the owslafa said, 'you needn't make such a fuss. he's lucky to
be alive.' so while we were chewing on that, someone came out and said the
council were ready for us.
     "as soon as we got in, we were put up in front of this general woundwort, and
he really is a grim customer. i don't think even you'd match up to him, bigwig.
he's almost as big as a hare and there's something about his mere presence that
frightens you, as if blood and fighting and killing were all just part of the day's
work to him. i thought he'd begin by asking us some questions about who we
were and what we wanted, but he didn't do anything like that. he said, 'i'm going
to explain the rules of the warren and the conditions on which you'll live here.

misunderstanding. we were an embassy, i said, come from another warren to ask
for efrafa's goodwill and help. and i went on to explain that all we wanted was

their agreement to our persuading a few does to come back with us. when i'd
finished, general woundwort said that it was out of the question: there was
nothing to discuss. i replied that we'd like to stay with them for a day or two and
try to persuade them to change their mind.
     "'oh, yes,' he said, 'you'll stay. but there'll be no further occasion for you to
take up the council's time -- for the next few days at any rate.'
     "i said that seemed very hard. our request was surely a reasonable one. and i
was just going to ask them to consider one or two things from our point of view,

     "but it was all no use. at last we fell silent and general woundwort said, 'the
council can't spare any more time for you now, and i shall have to leave it to your
mark captain to tell you the rules. you'll join the right flank mark under captain
bugloss. later, we shall see you again and you'll find us perfectly friendly and

you won't come?'
     "he looked doubtful at that and i made as if i were going. but then, all of a

want to hang about half the night doing your job.' he scuttled off. i turned to the
other two and said, 'stay here, and look alive, too. i'm going round the sentries.'
     "well, then the four of us ran off into the dark and, sure enough, after we'd
gone a little way two sentries popped up and tried to stop us. we all piled straight

     "i never thought, hazel," interrupted holly, "i never thought that the time
would come when i should feel obliged to speak against you. but i can only say
again that this is likely to be a complete disaster. i know what you think -- you're

     "and if that happens, i shan't ignore it," said hazel.
     there was silence. then bigwig spoke.
     "you may as well all know that i'm going," he said, "and we shall have kehaar
with us, if that appeals to you at all."
     there was a buzz of surprise.
     "of course, there are some of us who ought to stay here," said hazel. "the farm
rabbits can't be expected to go; and i'm not asking anyone who went the first time
to go back again."
     "i'll come, though," said silver. "i hate general woundwort and his council
with all my guts and if we're really going to make fools of them i want to be there,
as long as i don't have to go back inside the place -- that i couldn't face. but, after
all, you're going to need someone who knows the way."
     "i'll come," said pipkin. "hazel-rah saved my -- i mean, i'm sure he knows
what's--" he became confused. "anyway, i'll come," he repeated, in a very
nervous voice.

have you been?"
     "sorry not to have come before," said blackberry. i've been talking to kehaar,
as a matter of fact, about the plan. he's improved it a good deal. if i'm not
mistaken, general woundwort's going to look remarkably silly before we've
finished. i thought at first that it couldn't be done, but now i feel sure it can."

     hazel turned on him sharply. bluebell sat up on his hind legs and said, "please,

inning to believe that after all he might have been rash. it
was clear that holly had not underrated their danger near efrafa. he had little
doubt that bigwig, by sheer chance, had led the fox onto a wide patrol which had
been following their trail. then, in the morning, again by luck and the help of
kehaar, they had evidently just missed another at the crossing of the iron road.
perhaps silver's fear was well founded and a patrol had already spotted and
reported them without their knowing? had general woundwort got some sort of
kehaar of his own? perhaps a bat was at this moment talking to him? how was
one to foresee and guard against everything? the grass seemed sour, the sunshine
chilly. hazel sat hunched under the firs, worrying dismally. he felt less annoyed,
now, with bigwig: he could understand his feelings. waiting was bad. he fidgeted
for some kind of action. just as he had decided to wait no longer, but to collect
everyone and go immediately, kehaar came flying from the direction of the

and then looked squarely at hazel.
     "it's sudden," he said. "i wasn't expecting it tonight. but that's all to the good --
i hated waiting. see you later."
     he touched his nose to hazel's, turned and hopped away into the undergrowth.

a few minutes later, guided by kehaar, he was running up the open pasture north
of the river, straight for the brick arch in the overgrown railway embankment and
the fields that lay beyond.

     dusk was falling on efrafa. in the failing light, general woundwort was

should be an alarm.
     captain chervil, one of the two officers of the mark, had just returned from a
round of his sentries and was talking to some of the does near the center of the
mark ground when he saw the general approaching. he looked quickly about to
see whether anything was at fault. since all seemed to be well, he began nibbling
at a patch of sweet vernal with the best air of indifference that he could manage.
     general woundwort was a singular rabbit. some three years before, he had
been born -- the strongest of a litter of five -- in a burrow outside a cottage garden
near cole henley. his father, a happy-go-lucky and reckless buck, had thought
nothing of living close to human beings except that he would be able to forage in
their garden in the early morning. he had paid dearly for his rashness. after two
or three weeks of spoiled lettuces and nibbled cabbage plants, the cottager had
lain in wait and shot him as he cam

ourney, for there
was no warren within the normal range of the efrafan patrols.
     "well," he said at length, "i dare say we might be able to find some use for you,
as you put it. campion here will look after you tonight, and tomorrow morning
you'll come before the council. meanwhile, don't start fighting, do you see? we
can give you plenty to do without that."
     "very well."
     the following morning, after the council had discussed the predicament of the
warren due to the recent losses, general woundwort proposed that, for a start,
they might do worse than try the big newcomer as an officer in the near hind
mark, under the instruction of captain chervil. the council, having seen him,
agreed. by ni-frith thlayli, still bleeding from the mark gash inflicted in his left
haunch, had taken up his duties.

     bigwig made his way into the field, conscious of the wary glances of the rabbits
he passed. he felt perplexed and apprehensive. how was he to begin his
dangerous task? begin he must, in one way or another, for kehaar had made it
clear that he was not ready to wait. there was nothing for it but to take a chance
and trust somebody. but whom? a warren like this must be full of spies. probably
only general woundwort knew who the spies were. was there a spy watching him
now?
     "i shall just have to trust my feelings," he thought. "i'll go round the place a bit
and see if i can make any friends. but i know one thing -- if i do succeed in
getting any does out of here, i'll take that poor wretched blackavar with me as
well. frith on a bridge! it makes me angry just to think of him being forced to sit
there like that. general woundwort indeed! a gun's too good for him."

day. but he knew that all efrafa lay between himself and hazel. his
thoughts broke up into the dismal fancies of anxiety. he fell into a half-dream, in
which captain campion turned into a seagull and flew screaming over the river,
until he woke in panic: and dozed again, to see captain chervil driving blackavar
before him toward a shining wire in the grass. and over all, as big as a horse in a
field, aware of all that passed from one end of the world to the other, brooded the
gigantic figure of general woundwort. at last, worn out with his apprehensions,
he passed into a deep sleep where even his fear could not follow, and lay without
sound or movement in the solitary burrow.

blinking and combing the fur along one side of his face as his eyes got accustomed
to the light. a few moments later he saw kehaar come flying across the field.
     "this is it, then," he said to himself. "here we go."
     at that moment a rabbit spoke from behind him.
     "thlayli, i want a few words with you. just come back under the bushes, will

     bigwig dropped on his front paws and looked round.
     it was general woundwort.

immediately that this would be futile and would only bring the whole place round

     bigwig crouched in his burrow, pressed against hyzenthlay. he was trembling,
but not with cold: the stuffy runs of the mark were dense with thunder; the air
felt like a deep drift of leaves. bigwig was close to utter nervous exhaustion. since
leaving general woundwort, he had become more and more deeply entangled in
all the age-old terrors of the conspirator. how much had woundwort discovered?
clearly, there was no information that failed to reach him. he knew that hazel
and the rest had come from the north and crossed the iron road. he knew about
the fox. he knew that a gull, which should have been far away at this time of year,
was hanging round efrafa and that he, bigwig, had deliberately been near it. he
knew that bigwig had made a friend of hyzenthlay.

beside hazel. in the same moment the rope parted and immediately the little
punt began to move along the bank in the steady current. when it had gone a few
yards, the stern swung slowly outward until it was broadside on to the stream. in
this position it drifted to the middle of the river and into the southward bend.
     looking back, the last thing bigwig saw was the face of general woundwort
staring out of the gap in the willow herb where the boat had lain. it reminded him

lthough he had
spoken resolutely in front of the others, he knew only too well how little hope
there was of saving the warren from the efrafans. they knew what they were
doing. no doubt they had their methods of breaking into a closed warren. it was
the faintest of chances that elil would disperse them. most of the thousand
hunted rabbits for food. a stoat or a fox took a rabbit and took no more until it
was ready to hunt again. but the efrafans were accustomed to a death here and
there. unless general woundwort himself were killed, they would stay until the
job was done. nothing would stop them, short of some unexpected catastrophe.
     but suppose that he himself were to go and talk to woundwort? might there
not just possibly be a chance of getting him to see sense? whatever had happened
at nutley copse, the efrafans could not fight to the finish against rabbits like
bigwig, holly and silver without losing lives -- probably a good many lives.

persuade him to agree to a new plan -- a plan that would be as good for one
warren as the other.
     "and perhaps it might be," thought hazel grimly. "but it's a possible chance
and so i'm afraid the chief rabbit has got to take it. and since this savage brute is
probably not to be trusted, i suppose the chief rabbit must go alone."
     he returned to the honeycomb and found bigwig.
     "i'm off to talk to general woundwort, if i can get hold of him," he said.
"you're chief rabbit until i come back. keep them at it."
     "but, hazel," said bigwig, "wait a moment. it's not safe--"
     "i shan't be long," said hazel. "i'm just going to ask him what he's up to."
     a moment later he was down the bank and limping up the track, pausing from
time to time to sit up and look about him for an efrafan patrol.

     when the punt floated down the river in the rain, part of general woundwort's
authority went with it. he could not have appeared more openly and completely
at a loss if hazel and his companions had flown away over the trees. until that
very moment he had shown up strongly, a most formidable adversary. his officers
had been demoralized by kehaar's unexpected attack. he had not. on the
contrary, he had kept up the pursuit in spite of kehaar and had actually carried
out a scheme to cut off the fugitives' retreat. cunning and resourceful in
adversity, he had nearly succeed

 and began to make their way along it
with some caution, since the sunset was in their eyes. the light west wind carried
a fresh smell of rabbits.
     "if they are running, they haven't gone far," said woundwort. "but i don't
think they are running. i think they're still in their warren."
     at that moment a rabbit came out of the grass and sat up in the middle of the
track. he paused for a few moments and then moved toward them. he was
limping and had a strained, resolute look.
     "you're general woundwort, aren't you?" said the rabbit. "i've come to talk to
you."
     "did thlayli send you?" asked woundwort.
     "i'm a friend of thlayli," replied the rabbit. "i've come to ask why you're here
and what it is you want."
     "were you on the riverbank in the rain?" said woundwort.
     "yes, i was."
     "what was left unfinished there will be finished now," said woundwort. "we
are going to destroy you."

     at that moment, in the sunset on watership down, there was offered to
general woundwort the opportunity to show whether he was really the leader of

than a tyrant with the courage and cunning of a pirate. for one beat of his pulse
the lame rabbit's idea shone clearly before him. he grasped it and realized what it
meant. the next, he had pushed it away from him. the sun dipped into the cloud

are rabbits outside, don't fight -- run."
     without another word he dashed up the tunnel and out into the wood, with
blackberry and dandelion on his heels.

hours.

wall. bigwig cuffed him twice across the face and felt the third blow pass through
his whiskers as he sprang back. the sound of his heavy breathing came plainly
from the top of the earth pile. bigwig, the blood oozing from his back and ear,
stood his ground and waited. suddenly he realized that he could see the dark
shape of general woundwort faintly outlined where he crouched above him. the
first traces of daylight were glimmering through the broken roof of the

     woundwort clambered out into the honeycomb, now dimly lit down the shaft
by the daylight outside. he had never felt so tired. he saw vervain and thunder
looking at him uncertainly. he sat on his haunches and tried to clean his face with
his front paws.
     "thlayli won't give any more trouble," he said. "you'd better just go in and
finish him off, vervain, since he won't come out."

he was very small and was looking
tensely about him -- wide-eyed as a kitten above ground for the first time -- as
though by no means sure where he might be. as woundwort watched, he raised a
trembling forepaw and passed it gropingly across his face. for a moment some
old, flickering, here-and-gone feeling stirred in the general's memory -- the smell
of wet cabbage leaves in a cottage garden, the sense of some easy-going, kindly
place, long forgotten and lost.
     "who the devil's that?" asked general woundwort.
     "it -- it must be the rabbit that's been lying there, sir," answered groundsel.
"the rabbit we thought was dead."
     "oh, is that it?" said woundwort. "well, he's just about your mark, isn't he,
vervain? that's one of them you might be able to tackle, at all events. hurry up,"

somewhere else and to defy the elil as resourcefully as ever. kehaar, who was
once asked if he would look out for him in his flights over the downs, merely
