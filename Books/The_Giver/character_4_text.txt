ll as
children-stop what they were doing and wait, confused, for an
explanation of the frightening event.



then all of the citizens had been ordered to go into the nearest
building and stay there. immediately, the rasping voice through
the speakers had said. leave your bicycles where they
are.

instantly, obediently, jonas had dropped his bike on its side on the
path behind his family's dwelling. he had run indoors and stayed
there, alone. his parents were both at work, and his little sister, lily,
was at the childcare center where she spent her after-school
hours.

looking through the front window, he had seen no people: none of
the busy afternoon crew of street cleaners, landscape workers,





and food delivery people who usually populated the community at
that time of day. he saw only the abandoned bikes here and there
on their sides; an upturned wheel on one was still revolving slowly.

he had been frightened then. the sense of his own community
silent, waiting, had made his stomach

ded. he was eager for it to come. and he was excited,
certainly. all of the elevens were excited about the event that would
be coming so soon.

but there was a little shudder of nervousness when he thought
about it, about what might happen.

apprehensive, jonas decided. that's what i am.

"who wants to be the first tonight, for feelings?" jonas's father
asked, at the conclusion of their evening meal.

it was one of the rituals, the evening telling of feelings.



sometimes jonas and his sister, lily, argued over turns, over who
would get to go first. their parents, of course, were part of the
ritual; they, too, told their feelings each evening. but like all parents-
-all adults-they didn't fight and wheedle for their turn.

nor did jonas, tonight. his feelings were too complicated this
evening. he wanted to share them, but he wasn't eager to begin the





process of sifting through his own complicated emotions, even with
the help that he knew his parents could give.

"you go, lily," he sa

id, seeing his sister, who was much younger-
only a seven-wiggling with impatience in her chair.

"i felt very angry this afternoon," lily announced. "my childcare
group was at the play area, and we had a visiting group of sevens,
and they didn't obey the rules at all. one of them-a male; i don't
know his name-kept going right to the front of the line for the slide,
even though the rest of us were all waiting. i felt so angry at him. i
made my hand into a fist, like this." she held up a clenched fist and
the rest of the family smiled at her small defiant gesture.

"why do you think the visitors didn't obey the rules?" mother asked

.

lily considered, and shook her head. "i don't know. they acted
like ... like ... "

"animals?" jonas suggested. he laughed.

"that's right," lily said, laughing too. "like animals." neither child
knew what the word meant, exactly, but it was often used to
describe someone uneducated or clumsy, someone who didn't fit
in.



"where were the visitors from?" father asked.

lily frowned, trying to remember. "our leader told us, when he
made the welcome speech, but i can't remember. i guess i wasn't
paying attention. it was from another community. they had to leave
very early, and they had their midday meal on the bus."

mother nodded. "do you think it's possible that their rules may be





different? and so they simply didn't know what your play area rules
were?"

lily shrugged, and nodded. "i suppose."

"you've visited other communities, haven't you?" jonas asked. "m

group has, often."

lily nodded again. "when we were sixes, we went and shared a
whole school day with a group of sixes in their community."

"how did you feel when you were there?"

lily frowned. "i felt strange. because their methods were different.
they were learning usages that my group hadn't learned yet, so we
felt stupid."

father was listening with interest. "i'm thinking, lily," he said,
"about the boy who didn't obey the rules today. do you think it's
possible that he felt strange and stupid, being in a new place with
rules that he didn't know about?"

lily pondered that. "yes," she said, finally.

"i feel a little sorry for him," jonas said, "even though i don't even
know him. i feel sorry for anyone who is in a place where he feels
strange and stupid."

"how do you feel now, lily?" father asked. "still angry?"

"i guess not," lily decided. "i guess i feel a little

 sorry for him. and
sorry i made a fist." she grinned.



jonas smiled back at his sister. lily's feelings were always





straightforward, fairly simple, usually easy to resolve. .he guessed
that his own had been, too, when he was a seven.

he listened politely, though not very attentively, while his father
took his turn, describing a feeling of worry that he'd had that day at
work: a concern about one of the newchildren who wasn't doing
well. jonas's father's title was nurturer. he and the other nurturers
were responsible for all the physical and emotional needs of every

g its earliest life. it was a very important job, jonas
knew, but it wasn't one that interested him much.

"what gender is it?" lily asked.

"male," father said. "he's a sweet little male with a lovely
disposition. but he isn't growing as fast as he should, and he
doesn't sleep soundly. we have him in the extra care section for
supplementary nurturing, but the committee's beginning to talk
about releasing him."

"oh, no, "mother murmured sympathetically. "i know how sad that
must make you feel."

jonas and lily both nodded sympathetically as well. release of
newchildren was always sad, because they hadn't had a chance to

ully lived; and release of a newchild, which
always brought a sense of what-could-we- have-done. this was
especially troubling for the nurturers, like father, who felt they had
failed somehow. but it happened very rarely.

"well," father said, "i'm going to keep trying. i may





ask the committee for permission to bring him here at night, if you
don't mind. you know what the night-crew nurturers are like. i think
this little guy needs something extra."

"of course," mother said, and jonas and lily nodded. they had
heard father complain about the night crew before. it was a lesser
job, night-crew nurturing, assigned to those who lacked the interest
or skills or insight for the more vital jobs of the daytime hours. most
of the people on the night crew had not even been given spouses
because they lacked, somehow, the essential capacity to connect
to others, which was required for the creation of a family unit.

"maybe we could even keep him," lily suggested sweetly, trying to
look innocent.

"lily," mother reminded her, smiling, "you know the rules."

two children-one male, one female-to each family unit. it was
written very clearly in the rules.

lily giggled. "well," she said, "i thought maybe just this once."

next, mother, who held a prominent position at the department of
justice, talked about her feelings. today a repeat offender had
been brought before her, someone who had broken the rules
before. someone who she hoped had been adequately and fairly
punished, and who had been restored to his place: to his job, his
home, his family unit. to see him brought before her a second time
caused her overwhelming feelings of frustration and ange

guilt, that she hadn't made a difference in his life.

"i feel frightened, too, for him," she confessed. "you know that
there's no third chance. the rules say that if there's a third
transgression, he simply has to be released." jonas shivered. he
knew it happened. there was even a boy in his group of elevens
whose father had been released years before. no one ever
mentioned it; the disgrace was unspeakable. it was hard to
imagine.

lily stood up and went to her mother. she stroked her mother's
arm.

from his place at the table, father reached over and took her hand.
jonas reached for the other.

one by one, they comforted her. soon she smiled, thanked them,
and murmured that she felt soothed.

the ritual continued. "jonas?" father asked. "you're last, tonight."

jonas sighed. this evening he almost would have preferred to keep
his feelings hidden. but it was, of course, against the rules.

"i'm feeling apprehensive," he confes

sed, glad that the appropriate
descriptive word had finally come to him. "why is that, son?" his
father looked concerned.

"i know there's really nothing to worry about," jonas explained,
"and that every adult has been through it. i know you have, father,
and you too, mother. but it's the ceremony that i'm apprehensive
about. it's almost december."

lily looked up, her eyes wide. "the ceremony of twelve," she
whispered in an awed voice. even the smallest children-lily's age
and younger-knew that it lay in the future for each of them.



"i'm glad you told us of your feelings," father said.

"lily," mother said, beckoning to the little girl, "go on now and get
into your nightclothes. father and i are going to stay here and talk
to jonas for a while."

lily sighed, but obediently she got down from her chair. "privately?"
she asked.

mother nodded. "yes," she said, "this talk will be a private one with
jonas."



11



jonas watched as his father poured a fresh

 cup of coffee. he
waited.

"you know," his father finally said, "every december was exciting to
me when i was young. and it has been for you and lily, too, i'm
sure. each december brings such changes."

jonas nodded. he could remember the decembers back to when
he had become, well, probably a four. the earlier ones were lost to
him. but he observed them each year, and he remembered lily's
earliest decembers. he remembered when his family received lily,
the day she was named, the day that she had become a one.

the ceremony for the ones was always noisy and fun. each
december, all the newchildren born in the previous year turned
one. one at a time-there were always fifty in each year's group, if
none had been released --they had been brought to the stage by



the nurturers who had cared for them since birth. some were
already walking, wobbly on their unsteady legs; others were no
more than a few days old, wrapped in blankets, held by their

urturers.

"i enjoy the naming," jonas said.

his mother agreed, smiling. "the year we got lily, we



12



knew, of course, that we'd receive our female, because we'd made
our application and been approved. but i'd been wondering and
wondering what her name would be."

"i could have sneaked a look at the list prior to the ceremony,"
father confided. "the committee always makes the list in advance,
and it's right there in the office at the nurturing center.

"as a matter of fact," he went on, "i feel a little guilty about this. but
i did go in this afternoon and looked to see if this yea

 his mother, the one responsible for
adherence to the rules, and was relieved that she was smiling.

his father nodded. "his name-if he makes it to the naming without
being released, of course-is to be gabriel. so i whisper that to him
when i feed him every four hours, and during exercise and




playtime. if no one can hear me.

"i call him gabe, actually," he said, and grinned. "gabe." jonas
tried it out. a good name, he decided. though jonas had only
become a five the year that they acquired lily and learned her
name, he remembered the excitement, the conversations at home,
wondering about her: how she would look, who she would be, how

13 i

she would fit into their established family unit. he remembered
climbing the steps to the stage with his parents, his father by his
side that year instead of with the nurturers, since it was the year
that he would be given a newchild of his own.

he remembered his mother taking the newchild, his sister, into her
arms, while the document was read to
 
 ___________________________
 
 the assembled family units.
"newchild twenty-three," the namer had read. "lily."

he remembered his father's look of delight, and that his father had
whispered, "she's one of my favorites. i was hoping for her to be
the one." the crowd had clapped, and jonas had grinned. he liked
his sister's name. lily, barely awake, had waved her small fist.
then they had stepped down to make room for the next family unit.

"when i was an eleven," his father said now, "as you are, jonas, i
was very impatient, waiting for the ceremony of twelve. it's a long
two days. i remember that i enjoyed the ones, as i always do, but
that i didn't pay much attention to the other ceremonies, except for
my sister's. she became a nine that year, and got her bicycle. i'd
been teaching her to ride mine, even though technicall

y i wasn't
supposed to."

jonas laughed. it was one of the few rules that was not taken very
seriously and was almost always broken. the children all received



their bicycles at nine; they were not allowed to ride bicycles before
then. but almost always, the older brothers and sisters had secretly
taught the younger ones. jonas had been thinking already about
teaching lily.

there was talk about changing the rule and giving the bicycles at
an earlier age. a committee was studying






14



the idea. when something went to a committee for study, the
people always joked about it. they said that the committee
members would become elders by the time the rule change was
made.

rules were very hard to change. sometimes, if it was a very
important rule-unlike the one governing the age for bicycles— it
would have to go, eventually, to the receiver for a decision. the

ustice, i found myself with people
who shared my interests. i made friends on a new level, friends of
all ages."

"did you still play at all, after twelve?" jonas asked.




"occasionally," his mother replied. "but it didn't seem as important
to me."

"i did," his father said, laughing. "i still do. every day, at the
nurturing center, i play bounce-on-the-knee, and peek-a-boo, and
hug-the-teddy." he reached over and stroked jonas's neatly
trimmed hair. "fun doesn't end when you become twelve."

lily appeared, wearing her nightclothes, in the doorway. she gave
an impatient sigh. "this is certainly a very long private
conversation," she said. "and there are certain people waiting for
their comfort object."

"lily," her mother said fondly, "you're very dose to being an eight,
and when you're an eight, your comfort object will be taken away. it
will be recycled to the younger children. you should be starting to
go off to sleep without it."

but her father had already gone to the shelf and take

n down the
stuffed elephant which was kept there. many



19



of the comfort objects, like lily's, were soft, stuffed, imaginary
creatures. jonas's had been called a bear.

"here you are, lily-billy," he said. "i'll come help you remove your
hair ribbons."

jonas and his mother rolled their eyes, yet they watched
affectionately as lily and her father headed to her sleeping-room
with the stuffed elephant that had been given to her as her comfort
object when she was born. his mother moved to her big desk and
opened her briefcase; her work never seemed to end, even when
she was at home in the evening. jonas went to his own desk and



began to sort through his school papers for the evening's
assignment. but his mind was still on december and the coming
ceremony.

though he had been reassured by the talk with his parents, he
hadn

't the slightest idea what assignment the elders would be
selecting for his future, or how he might feel about it when the day
came.

"oh, look!" lily squealed in delight. "isn't he cute? look how tiny he
is! and he has funny eyes like yours, jonas!" jonas glared at her.
he didn't like it that she had mentioned his eyes. he waited for his
father to chastise lily. but father was busy unstrapping the
carrying basket from the back of his bicycle. jonas walked over to
look.

it was the first thing jonas noticed as he looked at the newchild
peering up curiously from the basket. the pale eyes.

almost every citizen in the community had dark eyes. his parents
did, and lily did, and so did all of his group members and friends.
but there were a few exceptions: jonas himself, and a female five
who he had noticed had the different, lighter eyes. no one
mentioned 
 
 ___________________________
 
such things; it was not a rule, but was considered rude
to call attention to things that were unsettling or different about
individuals. lily, he decided, would have to learn that soon, or she
would be called in for chastisement because of her insensitive
chatter.

father put his bike into its port. then he picked up the basket and
carried it into the house. lily followed

behind, but she glanced back over her shoulder at jonas and
teased, "maybe he had the same birthmother as you."

jonas shrugged. he followed them inside. but he had been startled
by the newchild's eyes. mirrors were rare in the community; they
weren't forbidden, but there was no real need of them, and jonas
had simply never bothered to look at himself very often even when
he found himself in a location where a mirror existed. now, seeing
the newchild and its expression, he was reminde
 
 ___________________________
 
d that the light
eyes were not only a rarity but gave the one who had them a
certain look-what was it? depth, he decided; as if one were looking
into the clear water of the river, down to the bottom, where things
might lurk which hadn't been discovered yet. he felt self-conscious,
realizing that he, too, had that look.

he went to his desk, pretending not to be interested in the
newchild. on the other side of the room, mother and lily were
bending over to watch as father unwrapped its blanket.

"what's his comfort object called?" lily asked, picking up the
stuffed creature which had been placed beside the newchild in his
basket.

father glanced at it. "hippo," he said.

lily giggled at the strange word. "hippo," she repeated, and put the
comfort object down again. she peered at the unwrapped newchild,
who waved his arms.

"i think newchildren are so cute," lily sighed. "i hope i get assigned
to be a birthmother."

"lily!" mo

ther spoke very sharply. "don't say that. there's very little






honor in that assignment."



"but i was talking to natasha. you know the ten who

lives around the corner? she does some of her volunteer hours at
the birthing center. and she told me that the birthmothers get
wonderful food, and they have very gentle exercise periods, and
most of the time they just play games and amuse themselves while
they're waiting. 1 think i'd like that," lily said petulantly.

"three years," mother told her firmly. "three births and that's all.
after that they are laborers for the rest of their adult lives, until the
day that they enter the house of the old. is that what you want,
lily? three lazy years, and then hard physical labor until you are
old?"

"well, no, i guess not," lily acknowledged reluctantly father turned
the newchild onto his tummy in the basket. he sat beside it and
rubbed its small back with a rhythmic motion. "anyway, lily-billy,
 
 ___________________________
 
"
he said affectionately, "the birthmothers never even get to see
newchildren. if you enjoy the little ones so much, you should hope
for an assignment as nurturer."

"when you're an eight and start your volunteer hour, you can try
some at the nurturing center," mother suggested.

"yes, i think i will," lily said. she knelt beside the basket. "what did
you say his name is? gabriel? hello, gabriel," she said in a
singsong voice. then she giggled "ooops," she whispered. "i think
he's alseep. i guess i'd better be quiet."

jonas turned to the school assignments on his desk some chance
of that, he thought. lily was never quiet probably she should hope



for an assignment as speaker so that she could sit in the office with
the microphone all day, making announcements. he laughed
silently to himself, pi

voice that all the speakers seemed to develop, saying things like,
attention. this is a reminder to females under nine
that hair ribbons are to be neatly tied at all times.

he turned toward lily and noticed to his satisfaction that her
ribbons were, as usual, undone and dangling. there would be an
announcement like that quite soon, he felt certain, and it would be
directed mainly at lily, though her name, of course, would not be
mentioned. everyone would know.

everyone had known, he remembered with humiliation, that the
announcement attention. this is a reminder to male
elevens that objects are not to be removed from
the recreation area and that snacks are to be
eaten, not hoarded had been specifically directed at him, the
day last month that he had taken an apple home. no one had
mentioned it, not even his parents, because the public
announcement had been sufficient to produc

jonas had been completely mystified.

"ash?" he had called. "does anything seem strange to you? about
the apple?"

"yes," asher called back, laughing. "it jumps out of



25



my hand onto the ground!" asher had just dropped it once again.

so jonas laughed too, and with his laughter tried to ignore his
uneasy conviction that something had happened. but he had taken
the apple home, against the recreation area rules. that evening,
before his parents and lily arrived at the dwelling, he had held it in
his hands and looked at it carefully. it was slightly bruised now,
because asher had dropped it several times. but there was nothing
at all unusual about the apple.

he had held a magnifying glass to it. he had tossed it several times
across the room, watching, and then rolled it around and around on
his desktop, waiting for the thing to happen again.

but it hadn't. the only thing that happened was the announcement
later that evening over the speaker,
 
 ___________________________
 
 the announcement that had
singled him out without using his name, that had caused both of his
parents to glance meaningfully at his desk where the apple still lay.

now, sitting at his desk, staring at his schoolwork as his family
hovered over the newchild in its basket, he shook his head, trying
to forget the odd incident. he forced himself to arrange his papers
and try to study a little before the evening meal. the newchild,
gabriel, stirred and whimpered, and father spoke softly to lily,
explaining the feeding procedure as he opened the container that
held the formula and equipment.



the evening proceeded as all evenings did in the family unit, in the
dwelling, in the community: quiet, reflective, a time for renewal and
preparation for the day to come. it was different only in the addition
to it of the newchild with his pale, solemn, knowing eyes.



26



jonas rode at a leisurely pace, glancing at the bikeports beside the
buildings to see if he could spot asher's. he didn'
 
 ___________________________
 
t often do his
volunteer hours with his friend because asher frequently fooled
around and made serious work a little difficult. but now, with twelve
coming so soon and the volunteer hours ending, it didn't seem to
matter.

the freedom to choose where to spend those hours had always
seemed a wonderful luxury to jonas; other hours of the day were
so carefully regulated.

he remembered when he had become an eight, as lily would do
shortly, and had been faced with that freedom of choice. the eights
always set out on their first volunteer hour a little nervously, giggling
and staying in groups of friends. they almost invariably did their
hours on recreation duty first, helping with the younger ones in a
place where they still felt comfortable. but with guidance, as they
developed self-confidence and maturity, they moved on to other
jobs, gravitating toward those that would suit their own interests
and skills.

successes without breaking the rule against bragging, even if one
didn't mean to. it was a minor rule, rather like rudeness, punishable
only by gentle chastisement. but still. better to steer clear of an
occasion governed by a rule which would be so easy to break.

the area of dwellings behind him, jonas rode past the community
structures, hoping to spot asher's bicycle parked beside one of the
small factories or office buildings. he passed the childcare center
where lily stayed after school, and the play areas surrounding it.
he rode through the central plaza and the large auditorium where
public meetings were held.

jonas slowed and looked at the nametags on the bicycles lined up
outside the nurturing center. then he checked those outside food
distribution; it was always fun to help with the deliveries, and he
hoped he would find his friend there so that they could go together
on the daily rounds, carrying the cartons of supplies into the
dwellings of the comm

"right.!" she hooted, and jonas helped her from the tub.

usually, at the morning ritual when the family members told their
dreams, jonas didn't contribute much. he rarely dreamed.
sometimes he awoke with a feeling of fragments afloat in his sleep,
but he couldn't seem to grasp them and put them together into
something worthy of telling at the ritual.

but this morning was different. he had dreamed very vividly the
night before.

his mind wandered while lily, as usual, recounted a lengthy dream,
this one a frightening one in which she had, against the rules, been
riding her mother's bicycle and been caught by the security
guards.

they all listened carefully and discussed with lily the warning that
the dream had given.

"thank you for your dream, lily." jonas said the standard phrase
automatically, and tried to pay better attention while his mother told




of a dream fragment, a disquieting scene where she had been
chastised for a rule infraction

was there, the way she was yesterday."

"asher, too?" mother asked.

jonas shook his head. "no. it was only me and fiona, alone in the
room, standing beside the tub. she was laughing. but i wasn't. i
was almost a little angry at her, in the dream, because she wasn't
taking me seriously."

"seriously about what?" lily asked.

jonas looked at his plate. for some reason that he didn't
understand, he felt slightly embarrassed. "i think i

was trying to convince her that she should get into the tub of water."

he paused. he knew he had to tell it all, that it was not only all right
but necessary to tell all of a dream. so he forced himself to relate
the part that made him uneasy.

"i wanted her to take off her clothes and get into the tub," he
explained quickly. "i wanted to bathe her. i had the sponge i

p at his parents. "that's all," he said.

"can you describe the strongest feeling in your dream, son?"
father asked.

jonas thought about it. the details were murky and vague. but the
feelings were clear, and flooded him again now as he thought. "the
wanting, " he said. "i knew that she wouldn't. and i think i knew that
she shouldn't. but i wanted it so terribly. i could feel the wanting all
through me."




"thank you for your dream, jonas," mother said after a moment.
she glanced at father.

"lily," father said, "it's time to leave for school. would you walk
beside me this morning and keep an eye on the newchild's basket?
we want to be certain he doesn't wiggle himself loose."

jonas began to rise to collect his schoolbooks. he thought it
surprising that they hadn't talked about his dream at length before
the thank you. perhaps they found it as confusing as he had.

"wait, jonas," mother said gently. "i'll write an apology to your
instructor so that you won't have to speak one for being

he sank back down into his chair, puzzled. he waved to father and
lily as they left the dwelling, carrying gabe in his basket. he
watched while mother tidied the remains of the morning meal and
placed the tray by the front door for the collection crew.

finally she sat down beside him at the table. "jonas," she said with
a smile, "the feeling you described as the wanting? it was your first
stirrings. father and i have been expecting it to happen to you. it
happens to everyone. it happened to father when he was your
age. and it happened to me. it will happen someda

stirrings. he had heard the word before. he remembered that there
was a reference to the stirrings in the book of rules, though he
didn't remember what it said. and now and then the speaker
mentioned it. attention. a reminder that stirrings
must be reported in order for treatment to take
place.



he had always ignored that announcement because he didn't
understand it and it had never seemed to apply to him in any way.
he ignored, as 
 
 ___________________________
 
 dream had felt pleasurable.
though the feelings were confused, he thought that he had liked
the feelings that his mother had called stirrings. he remembered
that upon waking, he had wanted to feel the stirrings again.



then, in the same way that his own dwelling slipped away behind
him as he rounded a corner on his bicycle, the dream slipped away
from his thoughts. very briefly, a little guiltily, he tried to grasp it
back. but the feelings had disappeared. the stirrings were gone.

"lily, please hold still," mother said again..

lily, standing in front of her, fidgeted impatiently. "i can tie them
myself," she complained. "i always have."

"i know that," mother replied, straightening the hair ribbons on the
little girl's braids. "but i also know that they constantly come loose
and more often than not, they're dangling down your back by
afternoon. today, at least, we want them to be neatly tied and to
stay neatly tied."

"i don't like hair ribbons. i'm glad i only have to wear t

added more cheerfully.

"there are good things each year," jonas reminded her. "this year
you get to start your volunteer hours. and remember last year,
when you became a seven, you were so happy to get your front-
buttoned jacket?"

the little girl nodded and looked down at herself, at the jacket with
its row of large buttons that designated her as a seven. fours,
fives, and sixes all wore jackets that fastened down the back so

independence, the first very visible symbol of growing up. the
bicycle, at nine, would be the powerful emblem of moving gradually
out into the community, away from the protective family unit.

lily grinned and wriggled away from her mother. "and this year you
get your assignment," she said to jonas in an excited voice. "i hope
you get pilot. and that you take me flying!"

"sure i will," said jonas. "and i'll get a special little parachute that
just fits you, and i'll take you up to, oh, maybe twenty thousand feet,
and open the door, and--"

"jonas, " mother warned.

"i was only joking," jonas groaned. "i don't want pilot, anyway. if i
get pilot i'll put in an appeal."

"jonas? are you ready? did you take your pill? i want to get a good
seat in the auditorium." she prodded lily to the front door and
jonas followed.

it was a short ride to the auditorium, lily waving to her friends from
her seat on the back of mother's bicycle. jonas stowed his bicycle
beside mother's and made his way through the throng to find his
group.

the entire community attended the ceremony each year. for the
parents, it meant two days holiday from work; they sat together in
the huge hall. children sat with their groups until they went, one by
one, to the stage.

with a plea on behalf of gabriel, who
had not yet gained the weight appropriate to his days of life nor
begun to sleep soundly enough at night to be placed with his family
unit. normally such a newchild would be labeled inadequate and
released from the community.

instead, as a result of father's plea, gabriel had been labeled
uncertain and given the additional year. he would continue to be
nurtured at the center and would spend his nights with jonas's
family unit. each family member, including lily, had been required
to sign a pledge that they would not become attached to this little
temporary guest, and that they would relinquish him without protest



or appeal when he was assigned to his own family unit at next
year's ceremony.

at least, jonas thought, after gabriel was placed next year, they
would still see him often because he would be

father had not had to release a single newchild this year, so
gabriel would have represented a real failure and sadness. even
jonas, though he didn't hover over the little one the way lily and his
father did, was glad that gabe had not been released.

the first ceremony began right on time, and jonas watched as one
after another each newchild was given a name and handed by the
nurturers to its new family unit. for some, it was a first child. but
many came to the stage accompanied by another child beaming
with pride to receive a little brother or sister, the way jonas had
when he was about to be a five.

asher poked jonas's arm. "remember when we got phillipa?" he

last of the first day's ceremonies, the eights.

jonas watched and cheered as lily marched proudly to the stage,
became an eight and received the identifying jacket that she would
wear this year, this one with smaller buttons and, for the first time,
pockets, indicating that she was mature enough now to keep track
of her own small belongings. she stood solemnly listening to the
speech of firm instructions on the responsibilities of eight and doing
volunteer hours for the first time. but jonas could see that lily,
though she seemed attentive, was looking longingly at the row o

gleaming bicycles, which would be presented tomorrow morning to
the nines.

next year, lily-billy, jonas thought.

it was an exhausting day, and even gabriel, retrieved in his basket
from the nurturing center, slept soundly that night.

finally it was the morning of the ceremony of twelve.

now father sat beside mother in the audience. jonas could see
them applauding dutifully as the nines, one by one, wheeled their
new bicycles, each with its gleaming nametag attached to the back,
from the stage. he knew that his parents cringed a little, as he did,

night for years the children had memorized the required lessons for
school, often yawning with boredom. tonight they would all begin
eagerly to memorize the rules for their adult assignments.



"congratulations, asher!" someone called. then that hesitation
again. "you too, jonas!"

asher and jonas responded with congratulations to their
groupmates. jonas saw his parents watching him from the place
where their own bicycles were waiting. lily had already been
strapped into her seat.

he waved. they waved back, smiling, but he noticed that lily was
watching him solemnly, her thumb in her mouth.

he rode directly to his dwelling, exchanging only small jokes and
unimportant remarks with asher.

"see you in the morning, recreation director!" he called,
dismounting by his door as asher continued on.

"right! see you!" asher called back. once again, there was just a
moment when things weren't quite the same, weren't quite as they

ys been through the long friendship. perhaps he had
imagined it. things couldn't change, with asher.

the evening meal was quieter than usual. lily chattered about her
plans for volunteer work; she would begin, she said, at the
nurturing center, since she was already an expert at feeding
gabriel.

"i know," she added quickly, when her father gave her a warning
glance, "i won't mention his name. i know i'm not supposed to know
his name.



"i can't wait for tomorrow to come," she said happily.
jonas sighed uneasily. "i can," he muttered.


"you've been greatly honored," his mother said. "your father and i
are very proud."

lie, of course. but the reason for precision of language was to
ensure that unintentional lies were never uttered. did he
understand that? they asked him. and he had.

he had never, within his memory, been tempted to lie. asher did
not lie. lily did not lie. his parents did not lie. no one did. unless ...

now jonas had a thought that he had never had before. this new
thought was frightening. what if others-adult-- had, upon becoming
twelves, received in their instructions the same terrifying
sentence?

what if they had all been instructed: you may lie?

was almost unimaginable), ask someone, some adult, his father

corpse; then it reached up, broke some leafy branches with a snap,
and draped them over the mass of torn thick flesh.

finally it tilted its massive head, raised its trunk, and roared into the
empty landscape. jonas had never heard such a sound. it was a
sound of rage and grief and it seemed never to end.

he could still hear it when he opened his eyes and lay anguished
on the bed where he received the memories.

it continued to roar into his consciousness as he pedaled slowly
home.

"lily," he asked that evening when his sister took her comfort
object, the stuffed elephant, from the shelf, "did you know that once
there really were elephants? live ones?"

she glanced down at the ragged comfort object and grinned.


"right," she said, skeptically. "sure, jonas."

jonas went and sat beside them while his father untied lily's hair
ribbons and combed her hair. he placed one hand on each of their
shoulders. with all of his being he tried to give each of them a piece
of the memory: not

 of the tortured cry of the elephant, but of the
being of the elephant, of the towering, immense creature and the
meticulous touch with which it had tended its friend at the end.

but his father had continued to comb lily's long hair, and lily,
impatient, had finally wiggled under her brother's touch. "jonas,"
she said, "you're hurting me with your hand."

"i apologize for hurting you, lily," jonas mumbled, and took his
hand away.

" 'ccept your apology," lily responded indifferently, stroking the
lifeless elephant.

"giver," jonas asked once, as they prepared for the day's work,
"don't you have a spouse? aren't you allowed to apply for one?"
although he was exempted from the rules against rudeness, he
was aware that this was a rude question. but the giver had
encouraged all of his questions, not seeming to be embarrassed or
offended by even the most personal.

the giver chuckled. "no, there's no rule against it.

u're forgetting how old i am, jonas. my

"oh, of course." jonas had forgotten the giver's obvious age.
when adults of the community became older, their lives became





different. they were no longer needed to create family units.
jonas's own parents, when he and lily were grown, would go to
live with the childless adults.

"you'll be able to apply for a spouse, jonas, if you want to. i'll warn
you, though, that it will be difficult. your living arrangements will
have to be different from those of most family units, because the
books are forbidden to citizens. you and i are the only ones with
access to the books."

jonas glanced around at the astonishing array of volumes. from
time to time, now, he could see their colors. with their hours

ntion.

"after all this extra time i've put in with him," father said one
evening after gabriel had been bathed and was lying, for the
moment, hugging his hippo placidly in the small crib that had
replaced the basket, "i hope they're not going to decide to release
him."

"maybe it would be for the best," mother suggested. "i know you
don't mind getting up with him at night. but the lack of sleep is
awfully hard for me."

"if they release gabriel, can we get another newchild as a visitor?"
asked lily. she was kneeling beside the crib, making funny faces at
the little one, who was smiling back at her.

jonas's mother rolled her eyes in dismay.



"no," father said, smiling. he ruffled lily's hair. "it's very rare,
anyway, that a newchild's status is as uncertain as gabriel's. it
probably won't happen again, for a long time.

"anyway," he sighed, "they won't make the decision for a while.
right now we're all preparing for a release we'll probably have to
make very soon. there's a birthmother

life elsewhere would be quiet and serene as befit the old; she
would not welcome the responsibility of nurturing a newchild who
needed feeding and care, and would likely cry at night.




"mother? father?" he said, the idea coming to him unexpectedly,
"why don't we put gabriel's crib in my room tonight? i know how to
feed and comfort him, and it would let you and father get some
sleep."

father looked doubtful. "you sleep so soundly, jonas. what if his
restlessness didn't wake you?"

it was lily who answered that. "if no one goes to tend gabriel," she
pointed out, "he gets very loud. he'd wake all of us, if jonas slept
through it."

father laughed. "you're right, lily-billy. all right, jonas, let's try it,
just for tonight. i'll take the night off and we'll let mother get some
sleep, too."

gabriel slept soundly for the earliest part of the night. jonas, in his
bed, lay awake for a while; from time to time he raised himself on
one elbow, looking over at the crib.

must have had parents! i never
thought about it before. who are my parents-of-the-parents? where
are they?"

"you could go look in the hall of open records. you'd find the
names. but think, son. if you apply for children, then who will be
their parents-of-the-parents? who will be their grandparents?"

"my mother and father, of course."

"and where will they be?"

jonas thought. "oh," he said slowly. "when i finish my training and
become a full adult, i'll be given my own dwelling. and then when
lily does, a few years later, she'll get her own dwelling, and maybe
a spouse, and children if she applies for them, and then mother and


father--"

"that's right."

"as long as they're still working and contributing to the community,
they'll go and live with the other childless adults. and they won't be
part of my life anymore.

"and after that, when the time comes, they'll go to the house of the
old," jonas went on. he was thinking aloud. "and they'll be well
cared for, and respected, and when th

celebration."




"which you won't attend," the giver pointed out.

"no, of course not, because i won't even know about it. by then i'll
be so busy with my own life. and lily will, too. so our children, if we
have them, won't know who their parents-of-parents are, either.

"it seems to work pretty well that way, doesn't it? the way we do it
in our community?" jonas asked. "i just didn't realize there was any
other way, until i received that memory."

"it works," the giver agreed.

jonas hesitated. "i certainly liked the memory, though. i can see
why it's your favorite. i couldn't quite get the word for the whole
feeling of it, the feeling that was so strong in the r

memories of soft rainfall against windowpanes; memories of
dancing barefoot on a damp lawn.

"gabe?"

the newchild stirred slightly in his sleep. jonas looked over at him.

"there could be love," jonas whispered.

the next morning, for the first time, jonas did not take his pill.
something within him, something that had grown there through the
memories, told him to throw the pill away.




today is declared an unscheduled holiday. jonas, his
parents, and lily all turned in surprise and looked at the wall
speaker from which the announcement had come. it happened so
rarely, and was such a treat for the entire community when it did.
adults were exempted from the day's work, children from school
and training and volunteer hours. the substitute laborers, who
would be given a different holiday, took over all the necessary
tasks: nurturing, food delivery, and care of the old; and the
community was free.

jonas cheered, and put his homework folder down. he

ame, and an elsewhere to which it was going.

on this unexpected, casual holiday he felt happy, as he always had
on holidays; but with a deeper happiness than ever before.
thinking, as he always did, about precision of language, jonas
realized that it was a new depth of feelings that he was
experiencing. somehow they were not at all the same as the
feelings that every evening, in every dwelling, every citizen
analyzed with endless talk.

"i felt angry because someone broke the play area rules," lily had
said once, making a fist with her small hand to indicate her fury.
her family-jonas among them--had talked about the possible
reasons for rule-breaking, and the need for understanding and
patience, until lily's fist had relaxed and her anger was gone.

but lily had not felt anger, jonas realized now. shallow



132



impatience and exasperation, that was all lily had felt. he knew
that with certainty because now he knew what anger was. now he
had, in the memories, experienced injustice and
 
 ___________________________
 
carefree sense of security-all of these things seemed to be
slipping away. with his new, heightened feelings, he was
overwhelmed by sadness at the way the others had laughed and
shouted, playing at war. but he knew that they could not
understand why, without the memories. he felt such love for asher
and for fiona. but they could not feel it back, without the memories.
and he could not give them those. jonas knew with certainty that
he could change nothing.

back in their dwelling, that evening, lily chattered merrily about the
wonderful holiday she had had, playing with her friends, having her
midday meal out of doors, and (she confessed) sneaking a very
short try on her father's bicycle.

"i can't wait till i get my very own bicycle next month. father's is too
big for me. i fell," she explained matter-of-factly.

"good thing gabe wasn't in the child seat!"

"a very good thing," mother agreed, frowning at the idea of it.
gabriel waved his arms at the mention of himself. he had begun to
wal

n at the nurturing center, father said,
but also for the introduction of a discipline wand. now father
brought the slender instrument home with him each night, in case
gabriel misbehaved.

but he was a happy and easygoing toddler. now he moved
unsteadily across the room, laughing. "gay!" he chirped. "gay!" it
was the way he said his own name.

jonas brightened. it had been a depressing day for him, after such
a bright start. but he set his glum thoughts aside. he thought about
starting to teach lily to ride so that she could speed off proudly
after her ceremony of nine, which would be coming soon. it was
hard to believe that it was almost december again, that almost a
year had passed since he had become a twelve.

he smiled as he watched the newchild plant one small foot carefully
before the other, grinning with glee at his own steps as he tried
them out.

"i want to get to sleep early tonight," father said. "tomorrow's a
busy day for me. the twins are being born tomorrow, and the test

"one for here, one for elsewhere," lily chanted. "one for here, one
for else--"

"do you actually take it elsewhere, father?" jonas asked.

"no, i just have to make the selection. i weigh them, hand the larger



waiting, and then i get the smaller one all cleaned up and comfy.
then i perform a small ceremony of release and--" he glanced
down, grinning at gabriel. "then i wave bye-bye," he said, in the
special sweet voice he used when he spoke to the newchild. he
waved his hand in the familiar gesture.

gabriel giggled and waved bye-
 
 ___________________________
 
bye back to him.

"and somebody else comes to get him? somebody from
elsewhere?"

"that's right, jonas-bonus."

jonas rolled his eyes in embarrassment that his father had used
the silly pet name.

lily was deep in thought. "what if they give the little twin a name
elsewhere, a name like, oh, maybe jonathan? and here, in our
community, at his naming, the twin that we kept here is given the
name jonathan, and then there would be two children with the
same name, and they would look exactly the same, and someday,
maybe when they were a six, one group of sixes would go to visit
another community on a bus, and there in the other community, in
the other group of sixes, would be a jonathan who was ex

actly the
same as the other jonathan, and then maybe they would get mixed
up and take the wrong jonathan home, and maybe his parents
wouldn't notice, and then-
she paused for breath.



lily," mother said, "i have a wonderful idea. maybe when you


become a twelve, they'll give you the assignment of storyteller! i
don't think we've had a storyteller in the community for a long time.
but if i were on the committee, i would definitely choose you for
that job!"



138



lily grinned. "i have a better idea for one more story," she
announced. "what if actually we were all twins and didn't know it,
and so elsewhere there would be another lily, and another jonas,
and another father, and another asher, and another chief elder,
and another--"



father groaned. "lily," he said. "it's bedtime."

"do you mean my own release, or just the general topic of

have given away an awful lot of important memories, so even
though they would select a new receiver, the memories would be
gone except for the shreds that you have left of them? and then
what if- "

he started to laugh, suddenly. "i sound like my sister, lily," he said,
amused at himself.



the giver looked at him gravely. "you just stay away from the river,
my friend," he said. "the community lost rosemary after five weeks
and it was a disaster for them. i don't know whatxhe community
would do if they lost you."

"why was it a disaster?"

"i think i mentioned to you once," the giver reminded him, "that
when she was gone, the memories came back to the people. if you
were to be lost in the river, jonas, your memories would not be lost
with you. memo

into the room. i'll be waiting for you."

his parents would discover, when they woke, that he was gone.
they would also find a cheerful note from jonas on his bed, telling
them that he was going for an early morning ride along the river;
that he would be back for the ceremony.

his parents would be irritated but not alarmed. they would think



him inconsiderate and they would plan to chastise him, later.

they would wait, with mounting anger, for him; finally they would be
forced to go, taking lily to the ceremony without him.

"they won't say anything to anyone, though," jonas said, quite
certain. "they won't call attention to my rudeness because it would
reflect on their parenting. and anyway, everyone is so involved in
the ceremony that they



160



probably won't notice that i'm not there. now that i'm a twelve and

he felt, surprisingly, no fear, nor any regret at leaving






the community behind. but he felt a very deep sadness that he had
left his closest friend behind. he knew that in the danger of his
escape he must be absolutely silent; but with his heart and mind,
he called back and hoped that with his capacity for hearing-beyond,
the giver would know that jonas had said goodbye.



it had happened at the evening meal. the family unit was eating
together as always: lily chattering away, mother and father making
their customary comments (and lies, jonas knew) about the day.
nearby, gabriel played happily on the floor, babbling his baby talk,
looking with glee now and then toward jonas, obviously delighted
to have him back after the unexpected night away from the
dwelling.

father glanced down toward the toddler. "enjoy it, little guy," he
said. "this is your last night as visitor."

"what do you mean?" jonas asked him.

father sighed with disappointment. "well,
 
 ___________________________
 
 you know he wasn't here
when you got home this morning because we had him stay
overnight at the nurturing center. it seemed like a good
opportunity, with you gone, to give it a try. he'd been sleeping so
soundly."

"didn't it go well?" mother asked sympathetically.

father gave a rueful laugh. "that's an understatement. it was a
disaster. he cried all night, apparently. the night crew couldn't
handle it. they were really frazzled by the time i got to work."

"gabe, you naughty thing," lily said, with a scolding little cluck
toward the grinning toddler on the floor.

"so," father went on, "we obviously had to make the



165



decision. even i voted for gabriel's release when we had the
meeting this afternoon."

jonas put down his fork and stared at his father. "release?" he

asked.

father nodded. "we certainly gave it our best try, didn't we?"

"yes, we did," mother agreed emphatically.

lily nodded in agreement, too.

jonas worked at keeping his voice absolutely calm. "when?"
