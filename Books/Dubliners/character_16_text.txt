 the world!... there now!”
little chandler felt his cheeks suffused with shame and he stood back out of the lamplight. he listened while the paroxysm of the child’s sobbing grew less and less; and tears of remorse started to his eyes.

the bell rang furiously and, when miss parker went to the tube, a furious voice called out in a piercing north of ireland accent:
“send farrington here!”
miss parker returned to her machine, saying to a man who was writing at a desk:
“mr alleyne wants you upstairs.”
the man muttered “blast him!” under his breath and pushed back his chair to stand up. when he stood up he was tall and of great bulk. he had a hanging face, dark wine-coloured, with fair eyebrows and moustache: his eyes bulged forward slightly and the whites of them were dirty. he lifted up the counter and, passing by the clients, went out of the office with a heavy step.
he went heavily upstairs until he came to the second landing, where a door bore a brass plate wit

h the inscription mr alleyne. here he halted, puffing with labour and vexation, and knocked. the shrill voice cried:
“come in!”
the man entered mr alleyne’s room. simultaneously mr alleyne, a little man wearing gold-rimmed glasses on a clean-shaven face, shot his head up over a pile of documents. the head itself was so pink and hairless it seemed like a large egg reposing on the papers. mr alleyne did not lose a moment:
“farrington? what is the meaning of this? why have i always to complain of you? may i ask you why you haven’t made a copy of that contract between bodley and kirwan? i told you it must be ready by four o’clock.”
“but mr shelley said, sir——”
“mr shelley said, sir.... kindly attend to what i say and not to what mr shelley says, sir. you have always some excuse or another for shirking work. let me tell you that if the contract is not copied before this even

ing i’ll lay the matter before mr crosbie.... do you hear me now?”
“yes, sir.”
“do you hear me now?... ay and another little matter! i might as well be talking to the wall as talking to you. understand once for all that you get a half an hour for your lunch and not an hour and a half. how many courses do you want, i’d like to know.... do you mind me, now?”
“yes, sir.”
mr alleyne bent his head again upon his pile of papers. the man stared fixedly at the polished skull which directed the affairs of crosbie & alleyne, gauging its fragility. a spasm of rage gripped his throat for a few moments and then passed, leaving after it a sharp sensation of thirst. the man recognised the sensation and felt that he must have a good night’s drinking. the middle of the month was passed and, if he could get the copy done in time, mr alleyne might give him an order on the cashier. he s

tood still, gazing fixedly at the head upon the pile of papers. suddenly mr alleyne began to upset all the papers, searching for something. then, as if he had been unaware of the man’s presence till that moment, he shot up his head again, saying:
“eh? are you going to stand there all day? upon my word, farrington, you take things easy!”
“i was waiting to see....”
“very good, you needn’t wait to see. go downstairs and do your work.”
the man walked heavily towards the door and, as he went out of the room, he heard mr alleyne cry after him that if the contract was

darkness, accompanied by a thick fog, was gaining upon the dusk of february and the lamps in eustace street had been lit. the man went up by the houses until he reached the door of the office, wondering whether he could finish his copy in time. on the stairs a moist pungent odour of perfumes saluted his nose: evidently miss delacour had come while he was out in o’neill’s. he crammed his cap back again into his pocket and re-entered the office, assuming an air of absent-mindedness.
“mr alleyne has been calling for you,” said the chief clerk severely. “where were you?”
the man glanced at the two clients who were standing at the counter as if to intimate that their presence prevented him from answering. as the clients were both male the chief clerk allowed himself a laugh.
“i know that game,” he said. “five times in one day is a little bit.... well, you better look sharp and get a copy of our correspondence in the delacour case for mr alleyne.”

e of the public, his run upstairs and the porter he had gulped down so hastily confused the man and, as he sat down at his desk to get what was required, he realised how hopeless was the task of finishing his copy of the contract before half past five. the dark damp night was coming and he longed to spend it in the bars, drinking with his friends amid the glare of gas and the clatter of glasses. he got out the delacour correspondence and passed out of the office. he hoped mr alleyne would not discover that the last two letters were missing.
the moist pungent perfume lay all the way up to mr alleyne’s room. miss delacour was a middle-aged woman of jewish appearance. mr alleyne was said to be sweet on her or on her money. she came to the office often and stayed a long time when she came. she was sitting beside his desk now in an aroma of perfumes, smoothing the handle of her umbrella and nodding the great black feather in her hat. mr alleyne had swivelled his chair round t

o face her and thrown his right foot jauntily upon his left knee. the man put the correspondence on the desk and bowed respectfully but neither mr alleyne nor miss delacour took any notice of his bow. mr alleyne tapped a finger on the correspondence and then flicked it towards him as if to say: “that’s all right: you can go.”
the man returned to the lower office and sat down again at his desk. he stared intently at the incomplete phrase: in no case shall the said bernard bodley be ... and thought how strange it was that the last three words began with the same letter. the chief clerk began to hurry miss parker, saying she would never have the letters typed in time for post. the man listened to th

fice singlehanded. his body ached to do something, to rush out and revel in violence. all the indignities of his life enraged him.... could he ask the cashier privately for an advance? no, the cashier was no good, no damn good: he wouldn’t give an advance.... he knew where he would meet the boys: leonard and o’halloran and nosey flynn. the barometer of his emotional nature was set for a spell of riot.
his imagination had so abstracted him that his name was called twice before he answered. mr alleyne and miss delacour were standing outside the counter and all the clerks had turn round in anticipation of something. the man got up from his desk. mr alleyne began a tirade of abuse, saying that two letters were missing. the man answered that he knew nothing about them, that he had made a faithful copy. the tirade continued: it was so bitter and violent that the man could hardly restrain his fist from descending upon the head of the manikin before him:
“i know nothing about any other two lette

rs,” he said stupidly.
“you—know—nothing. of course you know nothing,” said mr alleyne. “tell me,” he added, glancing first for approval to the lady beside him, “do you take me for a fool? do you think me an utter fool?”
the man glanced from the lady’s face to the little egg-shaped head and back again; and, almost before he was aware of it, his tongue had found a felicitous moment:
“i don’t think, sir,” he said, “that that’s a fair question to put to me.”
there was a pause in the very breathing of the clerks. everyone was astounded (the author of the wittici

sm no less than his neighbours) and miss delacour, who was a stout amiable person, began to smile broadly. mr alleyne flushed to the hue of a wild rose and his mouth twitched with a dwarf’s passion. he shook his fist in the man’s face till it seemed to vibrate like the knob of some electric machine:
“you impertinent ruffian! you impertinent ruffian! i’ll make short work of you! wait till you see! you’ll apologise to me for your impertinence or you’ll quit the office instanter! you’ll quit this, i’m telling you, or you’ll apologise to me!”

 to see if the cashier would come out alone. all the clerks passed out and finally the cashier came out with the chief clerk. it was no use trying to say a word to him when he was with the chief clerk. the man felt that his position was bad enough. he had been obliged to offer an abject apology to mr alleyne for his impertinence but he knew what a hornet’s nest the office would be for him. he could remember the way in which mr alleyne had hounded little peake out of the office in order to make room for his own nephew. he felt savage and thirsty and revengeful, annoyed with himself and with everyone else. mr alleyne would never give him an hour’s rest; his life would be a hell to him. he had made a proper fool of himself this time. could he not keep his tongue in his cheek? but they had never pulled together from the first, he and mr alleyne, ever since the day mr alleyne had overheard him mimicking his north of ireland acc

r of the liberal shepherds in the eclogues, he had to admit that it was not as clever as farrington’s retort. at this farrington told the boys to polish off that and have another.
just as they were naming their poisons who should come in but higgins! of course he had to join in with the others. the men asked him to give his version of it, and he did so with great vivacity for the sight of five small hot whiskies was very exhilarating. everyone roared laughing when he showed the way in which mr alleyne shook his fist in farrington’s face. then he imitated farrington, saying, “and here was my nabs, as cool as you please,” while farrington looked at the company out of his heavy dirty eyes, smiling and at times drawing forth stray drops of liquor from his moustache with the aid of his lower lip.
when that round was over there was a pause. o’halloran had money but neither of the other two seemed to have any; so the whole party left the shop somewhat regretfully. at the corner of duke stre
