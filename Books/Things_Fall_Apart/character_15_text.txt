ich many young men had. he neither inherited a barn nor a title,
nor even a young wife. but in spite of these disadvantages, he had
begun even in his father's lifetime to lay the foundations of a
prosperous future. it was slow and painful. but he threw himself
into it like one possessed. and indeed he was possessed by the fear
of his father's contemptible life and shameful death.

there was a wealthy man in okonkwo's village who had three
huge barns, nine wives and thirty children. his name was
nwakibie and he had taken the highest but one title which a man
could take in the clan. it was for this man that okonkwo worked to
earn his first seed yams.

he took a pot of palm-wine and a cock to nwakibie. two elderly
neighbors were sent for, and nwakibie's two grown-up sons were
also present in his obi. he presented a kola nut and an alligator
pepper, which were passed round for all to see and then returned to
him. he broke the nut saying: we shall all live. we pray for life,
children, a good harves

t and happiness. you will have what is
good for you and i will have what is good for me. let the kite
perch and let the eagle perch too. if one says no to the other, let his
wing break."



after the kola nut had been eaten okonkwo brought his palm-
wine from the corner of the hut where it had been placed and stood
it in the center of the group. he addressed nwakibie, calling him
"our father."



"nna ayi," he said. "1 have brought you this little kola. as our
people say, a man who pays respect to the great paves the way for
his own greatness. i have come to pay you my respects and also to
ask a favor. but let us drink the wine first."

everybody thanked okonkwo and the neighbors brought out their
drinking horns from the goatskin bags they carried. nwakibie
brought down his own horn, which was fastened to the rafters. the
younger of his sons, who was also t

moved to the center, raised the pot on his left knee and began to
pour out the wine. the first cup went to okonkwo, who must taste
his wine before anyone else. then the group drank, beginning with
the eldest man. when everyone had drunk two or three horns,
nwakibie sent for his wives. some of them were not at home and
only four came in.

"is anasi not in?" he asked them. they said she was coming. anasi
was the first wife and the others could not drink before her, and so
they stood waiting.

anasi was a middle-aged woman, tall and strongly built. there was
authority in her bearing and she looked every inch the ruler of the
womenfolk in a large and prosperous family. she wore the anklet
of her husband's titles, which the first wife alone could wear.

men then continued their drinking and talking. ogbuefi idigo
was talking about the palm-wine tapper, obiako, who suddenly
gave up his trade.



"there must be something behind it," he said, wiping the foam of
wine from his mustache with the back of his left hand. "there must
be a reason for it. a toad does not run in the daytime for nothing."

"some people say the oracle warned him that he would fall off a
palm tree and kill himself," said akukalia.

"obiako has always been a strange one," said nwakibie. "i have
heard that many years ago, when his father had not been dead very
long, he had gone to consult the oracle. the oracle said to him,
'your dead father wants you to sacrifice a goat to him.' do you
know what he told the oracle? he said,

'ask my dead father if he ever had a fowl when he was alive.'
everybody laughed heartily except okonkwo, who laughed
uneasily because, as the saying goes, an old woman is always
uneasy when dry bones are mentioned in a proverb. okonkwo
remembered his own

father.

at last the young man who was pouring out the wine held up half a
horn of the thick, white dregs and said, "what we are eating is
finished."

"we have seen it," the others replied. "who will drink the dregs?"
he asked. "whoever has a job in hand," said idigo, looking at
nwakibie's elder son igwelo with a malicious twinkle in his eye.

everybody agreed that igwelo should drink the dregs. he accepted
the half-full horn from his brother and drank it. as idigo had said,
igwelo had a job in hand because he had married his first wife a
month or two before. the thick dregs of palm-wine were supposed
to be good for men who were going in to their wives.




after the wine had been drunk okonkwo laid his difficulties before
nwakibie.

"i have come to you for help," he said. "pe

rhaps you can already
guess what it is. i have cleared a farm but have no yams to sow. i
know what it is to ask a man to trust another with his yams,
especially these days when young men are afraid of hard work. i
am not afraid of work. the lizard that jumped from the high iroko
tree to the ground said he would praise himself if no one else did. i
began to fend for myself at an age when most people still suck at
their mothers' breasts. if you give me some yam seeds i shall not
fail you."

nwakibie cleared his throat. "it pleases me to see a young man like
you these days when our youth has gone so soft. many young men
have come to me to ask for yams but i have refused because i
knew they would just dump them in the earth and leave them to be
choked by weeds. when i say no to them they think i am hard
hearted. but it is not so. eneke the bird says that since men have
learned to shoot without missing, he has learned to fly without
perching. i have learned to be stingy with my yams. but i ca

ripe corn by its look. i shall give you twice four hundred yams. go
ahead and prepare your farm."

okonkwo thanked him again and again and went home feeling
happy. he knew that nwakibie would not refuse him, but he had
not expected he would be so generous. he had not hoped to get
more than four hundred seeds. he would now have to make a
bigger farm. he hoped to get another four hundred yams from one
of his father's friends at isiuzo.

share-cropping was a very slow way of building up a barn of one's
own. after all the toil one only got a third of the harvest. but for a
young man whose father had no yams, there was no other way.





and what made it worse in okonkwo's case wa

ing his father. she could
not be expected to cook and eat while her husband starved. and so
at a very early age when he was striving desperately to build a barn
through share-cropping okonkwo was also fending for his father's
house. it was like pouring grains of corn into a bag full of holes.
his mother and sisters worked hard enough, but they grew
women's crops, like coco-yams, beans and cassava. yam, the king
of crops, was a man's crop.

the year that okonkwo took eight hundred seed-yams from
nwakibie was the worst year in living memory. nothing happened
at its proper time,- it was either too early or too late. it seemed as if
the world had gone mad. the first rains were late, and, when they
came, lasted only a brief moment. the blazing sun returned, more
fierce than it had ever been known, and scorched all the green that
had appeared with the rains. the earth burned like hot coals and
roasted all the yams that had been sown. like all good farmers,
okonkwo had begun to sow with the first rai

 the lazy
easy-going ones who always put off clearing their farms as long as
they could. this year they were the wise ones. they sympathized
with their neighbors with much shaking of the head, but inwardly
they were happy for what they took to be their own foresight.



okonkwo planted what was left of his seed-yams when the rains
finally returned. he had one consolation. the yams he had sown
before the drought were his own, the harvest of the previous year.
he still had the eight hundred from nwakibie and the four hundred
from his father's friend. so he would make a fresh start.



but the year had gone mad. rain fell as it had never fallen before.
for days and nights together it poured down in violent torrents, and
washed away the yam heaps. trees were uprooted and deep gorges
appeared everywhere. then the rain became less violent. but it
went from day to day without a pause. the spell of sunshine which
always came in the middle of the wet season did not appear. the
yams put on luxuriant gr
