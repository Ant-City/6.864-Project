nadian half-breed, and twice as swarthy. they were a new kind
of men to buck (of which he was destined to see many more), and while
he developed no affection for them, he none the less grew honestly to
respect them. he speedily learned that perrault and francois were fair
men, calm and impartial in administering justice, and too wise in the
way of dogs to be fooled by dogs.

in the ‘tween-decks of the narwhal, buck and curly joined two other
dogs. one of them was a big, snow-white fellow from spitzbergen who had
been brought away by a whaling captain, and who had later accompanied
a geological survey into the barrens. he was friendly, in a treacherous
sort of way, smiling into one’s face the while he meditated some
underhand trick, as, for instance, when he stole from buck’s food at the
first meal. as buck sprang to punish him, the lash of francois’s whip
sang through the air, reaching the culprit first; and nothing remained
to buck but to recover the bone. that was fair of francois

tentness, nor the eager way with which they
were licking their chops. curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again
and leaped aside. he met her next rush with his chest, in a peculiar
fashion that tumbled her off her feet. she never regained them, this
was what the onlooking huskies had waited for. they closed in upon her,
snarling and yelping, and she was buried, screaming with agony, beneath
the bristling mass of bodies.

so sudden was it, and so unexpected, that buck was taken aback. he saw
spitz run out his scarlet tongue in a way he had of laughing; and he saw
francois, swinging an axe, spring into the mess of dogs. three men
with clubs were helping him to scatter them. it did not take long. two
minutes from the time curly went down, the last of her assailants were
clubbed off. but she lay there limp and lifeless in the bloody, trampled
snow, almost literally torn to pieces, the swart half-breed standing
over her and cursing horribly. the scene often came back to buck to
trouble him i

n his sleep. so that was the way. no fair play. once down,
that was the end of you. well, he would see to it that he never went
down. spitz ran out his tongue and laughed again, and from that moment
buck hated him with a bitter and deathless hatred.

before he had recovered from the shock caused by the tragic passing
of curly, he received another shock. francois fastened upon him an
arrangement of straps and buckles. it was a harness, such as he had seen
the grooms put on the horses at home. and as he had seen horses work,
so he was set to work, hauling francois on a sled to the forest that
fringed the valley, and returning with a

load of firewood. though his
dignity was sorely hurt by thus being made a draught animal, he was too
wise to rebel. he buckled down with a will and did his best, though
it was all new and strange. francois was stern, demanding instant
obedience, and by virtue of his whip receiving instant obedience;
while dave, who was an experienced wheeler, nipped buck’s hind quarters
whenever he was in error. spitz was the leader, likewise experienced,
and while he could not always get at buck, he growled sharp reproof now
and again, or cunningly threw his weight in the traces to jerk buck
into the way he should go. buck learned easily, and under the combined
tuition of his two mates and francois made remarkable progress. ere they
returned to camp he knew enough to stop at “ho,” to go ahead at “mush,”
 to swing wide on the bends, and to keep clear of the wheeler when the
loaded sled shot downhill

g.”

by afternoon, perrault, who was in a hurry to be on the trail with his
despatches, returned with two more dogs. “billee” and “joe” he called
them, two brothers, and true huskies both. sons of the one mother though
they were, they were as different as day and night. billee’s one fault
was his excessive good nature, while joe was the very opposite, sour and
introspective, with a perpetual snarl and a malignant eye. buck received
them in comradely fashion, dave ignored them, while spitz proceeded to
thrash first one and then the other. billee wagged his tail appeasingly,
turned to run when he saw that appeasement was of no avail, and cried
(still appeasingly) when spitz’s sharp teeth scored his flank. but no
matter how spitz circled, joe whirled around on his heels to face
him, mane bristling, ears laid back, lips writhing and snarling, jaws
clipping together as fast as he could snap, and eyes diabolically
gleaming--the incarnation of belligerent fear. so terrible was his
ap

pearance that spitz was forced to forego disciplining him; but to
cover his own discomfiture he turned upon the inoffensive and wailing
billee and drove him to the confines of the camp.

by evening perrault secured another dog, an old husky, long and lean
and gaunt, with a battle-scarred face and a single eye which flashed a
warning of prowess that commanded respect. he was called sol-leks, which
means the angry one. like dave, he asked nothing, gave nothing, expected
nothing; and when he marched slowly and delibe

rately into their midst,
even spitz left him alone. he had one peculiarity which buck was unlucky
enough to discover. he did not like to be approached on his blind side.
of this offence buck was unwittingly guilty, and the first knowledge he
had of his indiscretion was when sol-leks whirled upon him and slashed
his shoulder to the bone for three inches up and down. forever after
buck avoided his blind side, and to the last of their comradeship had
no more trouble. his only apparent ambition, like dave’s, was to be left
alone; t

 had dropped from them. they were alert and active, anxious
that the work should go well, and fiercely irritable with whatever, by
delay or confusion, retarded that work. the toil of the traces seemed
the supreme expression of their being, and all that they lived for and
the only thing in which they took delight.

dave was wheeler or sled dog, pulling in front of him was buck, then
came sol-leks; the rest of the team was strung out ahead, single file,
to the leader, which position was filled by spitz.

buck had been purposely placed between dave and sol-leks so that he
might receive instruction. apt scholar that he was, they were equally
apt teachers, never allowing him to linger long in error, and enforcing
their teaching with their sharp teeth. dave was fair and very wise. he
never nipped buck without cause, and he never failed to nip him when he
stood in need of it. as francois’s whip backed him up, buck found it
to be cheaper to mend his ways than to retaliate. once, during a brief

 primordial beast


the dominant primordial beast was strong in buck, and under the fierce
conditions of trail life it grew and grew. yet it was a secret growth.
his newborn cunning gave him poise and control. he was too busy
adjusting himself to the new life to feel at ease, and not only did
he not pick fights, but he avoided them whenever possible. a certain
deliberateness characterized his attitude. he was not prone to rashness
and precipitate action; and in the bitter hatred between him and spitz
he betrayed no impatience, shunned all offensive acts.

on the other hand, possibly because he divined in buck a dangerous
rival, spitz never lost an opportunity of showing his teeth. he even
went out of his way to bully buck, striving constantly to start the
fight which could end only in the death of one or the other. early in
the trip this might have taken place had it not been for an unwonted
accident. at the end of this day they made a bleak and miserable camp
on the shore of lake le barge.

he tent they had discarded at dyea in order to travel light.
a few sticks of driftwood furnished them with a fire that thawed down
through the ice and left them to eat supper in the dark.

close in under the sheltering rock buck made his nest. so snug and warm
was it, that he was loath to leave it when francois distributed the
fish which he had first thawed over the fire. but when buck finished his
ration and returned, he found his nest occupied. a warning snarl told
him that the trespasser was spitz. till now buck had avoided trouble
with his enemy, but this was too much. the beast in him roared. he
sprang upon spitz with a fury which surprised them both, and spitz
particularly, for his whole experience with buck had gone to teach him
that his rival was an unusually timid dog, who managed to hold his own
only because of his great weight and size.

francois was surprised, too, when they shot out in a tangle from the
disrupted nest and he divined the cause of the trouble. “a-a-ah!”
 he c

ried to buck. “gif it to heem, by gar! gif it to heem, the dirty
t’eef!”

spitz was equally willing. he was crying with sheer rage and eagerness
as he circled back and forth for a chance to spring in. buck was no less
eager, and no less cautious, as he likewise circled back and forth for
the advantage. but it was then that the unexpected happened, the thing
which projected their struggle for supremacy far into the future, past
many a weary mile of trail and toil.

an oath from perrault, the resounding impact of a club upon a bony
frame, and a shrill yelp of pain, heralded

the breaking forth of
pandemonium. the camp was suddenly discovered to be alive with skulking
furry forms,--starving huskies, four or five score of them, who had
scented the camp from some indian village. they had crept in while buck
and spitz were fighting, and when the two men sprang among them with
stout clubs they showed their teeth and fought back. they were crazed
by the smell of the food. perrault found one with head buried in the
grub-box. his club landed heavily on the gaunt ribs, and the grub-box
was capsized on the ground. on the instant a score of the famished
brutes were scrambling for the bread and bacon. the clubs fell upon them
unheeded. they yelped and howled under the rain of blows, but struggled
none the less madly

pping like a demon. once, his teeth closed on the fore leg of
a husky, and he crunched down through the bone. pike, the malingerer,
leaped upon the crippled animal, breaking its neck with a quick flash of
teeth and a jerk, buck got a frothing adversary by the throat, and was
sprayed with blood when his teeth sank through the jugular. the warm
taste of it in his mouth goaded him to greater fierceness. he flung
himself upon another, and at the same time felt teeth sink into his own
throat. it was spitz, treacherously attacking from the side.

perrault and francois, having cleaned out their part of the camp,
hurried to save their sled-dogs. the wild wave of famished beasts rolled
back before them, and buck shook himself free. but it was only for a
moment. the two men were compelled to run back to save the grub, upon
which the huskies returned to the attack on the team. billee, terrified
into bravery, sprang through the savage circle and fled away over the
ice. pike and dub followed on his heel

s, with the rest of the team
behind. as buck drew himself together to spring after them, out of the
tail of his eye he saw spitz rush upon him with the evident intention
of overthrowing him. once off his feet and under that mass of huskies,
there was no hope for him. but he braced himself to the shock of spitz’s
charge, then joined the flight out on the lake.

later, the nine team-dogs gathered together and sought shelter in the
forest. though unpursued, they were in a sorry plight. there was not
one who was not wounded in four or five places, while some were wounded
grievously. dub was badly injured in a hind leg; dolly, the last husky
added to the team at dyea, had a badly torn throat; joe had lost an eye;
while billee, the good-natured, with an ear chewed and rent to ribbons,
cried and whimpered

nd struggling on from
dim dawn to dark. he skirted the frowning shores on rim ice that bent
and crackled under foot and upon which they dared not halt. once, the
sled broke through, with dave and buck, and they were half-frozen and
all but drowned by the time they were dragged out. the usual fire was
necessary to save them. they were coated solidly with ice, and the two
men kept them on the run around the fire, sweating and thawing, so close
that they were singed by the flames.

at another time spitz went through, dragging the whole team after him up
to buck, who strained backward with all his strength, his fore paws on
the slippery edge and the ice quivering and snapping all around. but
behind him was dave, likewise straining backward, and behind the sled
was francois, pulling till his tendons cracked.

again, the rim ice broke away before and behind, and there was no escape
except up the cliff. perrault scaled it by a miracle, while francois
prayed for just that miracle; and with every th

on started to cross it. and all the time, though he
did not look, he could hear her snarling just one leap behind. francois
called to him a quarter of a mile away and he doubled back, still one
leap ahead, gasping painfully for air and putting all his faith in that
francois would save him. the dog-driver held the axe poised in his hand,
and as buck shot past him the axe crashed down upon mad dolly’s head.

buck staggered over against the sled, exhausted, sobbing for breath,
helpless. this was spitz’s opportunity. he sprang upon buck, and twice
his teeth sank into his unresisting foe and ripped and tore the flesh to
the bone. then francois’s lash descended, and buck had the satisfaction
of watching spitz receive the worst whipping as yet administered to any
of the teams.

“one devil, dat spitz,” remarked perrault. “some dam day heem keel dat
buck.”

“dat buck two devils,” was francois’s rejoinder. “all de tam i watch dat
buck i know for sure. lissen: some dam fine day h

from then on it was war between them. spitz, as lead-dog and
acknowledged master of the team, felt his supremacy threatened by this
strange southland dog. and strange buck was to him, for of the many
southland dogs he had known, not one had shown up worthily in camp and
on trail. they were all too soft, dying under the toil, the frost, and
starvation. buck was the exception. he alone endured and prospered,
matching the husky in strength, savagery, and cunning. then he was a
masterful dog, and what made him dangerous was the fact that the

 them to die joyfully in the harness, and breaks their hearts
if they are cut out of the harness. this was the pride of dave as
wheel-dog, of sol-leks as he pulled with all his strength; the pride
that laid hold of them at break of camp, transforming them from sour and
sullen brutes into straining, eager, ambitious creatures; the pride
that spurred them on all day and dropped them at pitch of camp at night,
letting them fall back into gloomy unrest and uncontent. this was the
pride that bore up spitz and made him thrash the sled-dogs who blundered
and shirked in the traces or hid away at harness-up time in the morning.
likewise it was this pride that made him fear buck as a possible
lead-dog. and this was buck’s pride, too.

he openly threatened the other’s leadership. he came between him and the
shirks he should have punished. and he did it deliberately. one night
there was a heavy snowfall, and in the morning pike, the malingerer,
did not appear. he was securely hidden in his nest und

francois called him and sought him in vain. spitz was wild with wrath.
he raged through the camp, smelling and digging in every likely
place, snarling so frightfully that pike heard and shivered in his
hiding-place.

but when he was at last unearthed, and spitz flew at him to punish him,
buck flew, with equal rage, in between. so unexpected was it, and so
shrewdly managed, that spitz was hurled backward and off his feet. pike,
who had been trembling abjectly, took heart at this open mutiny,
and sprang upon his overthrown leader. buck, to whom fair play was a
forgotten code, likewise sprang upon spitz. but francois, chuckling at
the incident while unswerving in the administration of justice, brought
his lash down upon buck with all his might. this failed to drive buck
from his prostrate rival, and the butt of the whip was brought into
play. half-stunned by the blow, buck was
 
 ___________________________
 
 knocked backward and the lash
laid upon him again and again, while spitz soundly punished the many
times offending pike.

in the days that followed, as dawson grew closer and closer, buck still
continued to interfere between spitz and the culprits; but he did it
craftily, when francois was not around, with the covert mutiny of buck,
a general insubordination sprang up and increased. dave and sol-leks
were unaffected, but the rest of the team went from bad to worse.
things no longer went right. there was continual bickering and jangling.
trouble was always afoot, and at the bottom of it was buck. he kept
francois busy, for the dog-driver was in constant apprehension of the
life-and-death struggle between the two which he

knew must take place
sooner or later; and on more than one night the sounds of quarrelling
and strife among the other dogs turned him out of his sleeping robe,
fearful that buck and spitz were at it.

but the opportunity did not present itself, and they pulled into dawson
one dreary afternoon with the great fight still to come. here were many
men, and countless dogs, and buck found them all at work. it seemed the
ordained order of things that dogs should work. all day they swung up
and down the main street in long teams, and in the night their jingling
bells still went by. they hauled cabin logs and firewood, freighted up
to the mines, and did all manner of work that horses did

nd he was
travelling light.

they made sixty mile, which is a fifty-mile run, on the first day; and
the second day saw them booming up the yukon well on their way to pelly.
but such splendid running was achieved not without great trouble and
vexation on the part of francois. the insidious revolt led by buck
had destroyed the solidarity of the team. it no longer was as one dog
leaping in the traces. the encouragement buck gave the rebels led them
into all kinds of petty misdemeanors. no more was spitz a leader greatly
to be feared. the old awe departed, and they grew equal to challenging
his authority. pike robbed him of half a fish one night, and gulped
it down under the protection of buck. another night dub and joe fought
spitz and made him forego the punishment they deserved. and even
billee, the good-natured, was less good-natured, and whined not half
so placatingly as in former days. buck never came near spitz without
snarling and bristling menacingly. in fact, his conduct approached th

of a bully, and he was given to swaggering up and down before spitz’s
very nose.

the breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs in their
relations with one another. they quarrelled and bickered more than ever
among themselves, till at times the camp was a howling bedlam. dave and
sol-leks alone were unaltered, though they were made irritable by the
unending squabbling. francois swore strange barbarous oaths, and stamped
the snow in futile rage, and tore his hair. his lash was always singing
among the dogs, but it was of small avail. directly his

back was turned
they were at it again. he backed up spitz with his whip, while buck
backed up the remainder of the team. francois knew he was behind all the
trouble, and buck knew he knew; but buck was too clever ever again to be
caught red-handed. he worked faithfully in the harness, for the toil
had become a delight to him; yet it was a greater delight slyly to
precipitate a fight amongst his mates and tangle the traces.

at the mouth of the tahkeena, one night after supper, dub turned up a
snowshoe rabbit, blundered it, and missed. in a second the

iftly before him through the
moonlight. he was sounding the deeps of his nature, and of the parts of
his nature that were deeper than he, going back into the womb of time.
he was mastered by the sheer surging of life, the tidal wave of being,
the perfect joy of each separate muscle, joint, and sinew in that it was
everything that was not death, that it was aglow and rampant, expressing
itself in movement, flying exultantly under the stars and over the face
of dead matter that did not move.

but spitz, cold and calculating even in his supreme moods, left the pack
and cut across a narrow neck of land where the creek made a long bend
around. buck did not know of this, and as he rounded the bend, the frost
wraith of a rabbit still flitting before him, he saw another and larger
frost wraith leap from the overhanging bank into the immediate path of
the rabbit. it was spitz. the rabbit could not turn, and as the white
teeth broke its back in mid air it shrieked as loudly as a stricken man
may shri

ek. at sound of this, the cry of life plunging down from life’s
apex in the grip of death, the fall pack at buck’s heels raised a hell’s
chorus of delight.

buck did not cry out. he did not check himself, but drove in upon spitz,
shoulder to shoulder, so hard that he missed the throat. they rolled
over and over in the powdery snow. spitz gained his feet almost as
though he had not been overthrown, slashing buck down the shoulder and
leaping clear. twice his teeth clipped together, like the steel jaws of
a trap, as he backed away for better footing, with lean and lifting lips
that writhed and snarled.

in a flash buck knew it. the time had come. it was to the death. as
they circled about, snarling, ears laid back, keenly watchful for the
advantage, the scene came to buck with a sense of familiarity. he seemed
to remember it all,

he faintest whisper of air--nothing moved, not a leaf
quivered, the visible breaths of the dogs rising slowly and lingering in
the frosty air. they had made short work of the snowshoe rabbit, these
dogs that were ill-tamed wolves; and they were now drawn up in an
expectant circle. they, too, were silent, their eyes only gleaming and
their breaths drifting slowly upward. to buck it was nothing new or
strange, this scene of old time. it was as though it had always been,
the wonted way of things.

spitz was a practised fighter. from spitzbergen through the arctic, and
across canada and the barrens, he had held his own with all manner of
dogs and achieved to mastery over them. bitter rage was his, but never
blind rage. in passion to rend and destroy, he never forgot that his
enemy was in like passion to rend and destroy. he never rushed till
he was prepared to receive a rush; never attacked till he had first
defended that attack.

in vain buck strove to sink his teeth in the neck of the big whi

te dog.
wherever his fangs struck for the softer flesh, they were countered by
the fangs of spitz. fang clashed fang, and lips were cut and bleeding,
but buck could not penetrate his enemy’s guard. then he warmed up and
enveloped spitz in a whirlwind of rushes. time and time again he tried
for the snow-white throat, where life bubbled near to the surface, and
each time and every time spitz slashed him and got away. then buck took
to rushing, as though for the throat, when, suddenly drawing back his
head and curving in from the side, he would drive his shoulder at the
shoulder of spitz, as a ram by which to overthrow him. but instead,
buck’s shoulder was slashed down each time as spitz leaped lightly away.

spitz was untouched, while buck was streaming with blood and panting
hard. the fight was growing desperate. and all the while the silent and
wolfish circle waited to finish o

grew winded, spitz took to rushing, and he kept him staggering for
footing. once buck went over, and the whole circle of sixty dogs started
up; but he recovered himself, almost in mid air, and the circle sank
down again and waited.

but buck possessed a quality that made for greatness--imagination. he
fought by instinct, but he could fight by head as well. he rushed, as

was a crunch of breaking bone, and the white dog faced him on three
legs. thrice he tried to knock him over, then repeated the trick and
broke the right fore leg. despite the pain and helplessness, spitz
struggled madly to keep up. he saw the silent circle, with gleaming
eyes, lolling tongues, and silvery breaths drifting upward, closing in
upon him as he had seen similar circles close in upon beaten antagonists
in the past. only this time he was the one who was beaten.

there was no hope for him. buck was inexorable. mercy was a thing
reserved for gentler climes. he manoeuvred for the final rush. the
circle had tightened till he could feel the breaths of the huskies on
his flanks. he could see

 them, beyond spitz and to either side, half
crouching for the spring, their eyes fixed upon him. a pause seemed to
fall. every animal was motionless as though turned to stone. only spitz
quivered and bristled as he staggered back and forth, snarling with
horrible menace, as though to frighten off impending death. then buck
sprang in and out; but while he was in, shoulder had at last squarely
met shoulder. the dark circle became a dot on the moon-flooded snow as
spitz disappeared from view. buck stood and looked on, the successful
champion, the dominant primordial beast who had made his kill and found
it good.




chapter iv. who has won to mastership


“eh? wot i say? i spik true w’en i say dat buck two devils.” this was
francois’s speech next morning when he discovered spitz missing and buck
covered with wounds. he drew him to the fire and by its light pointed
them out.

“dat spitz fight lak hell,” said perrault, as he surveyed the gaping
rips 
 
 ___________________________
 
and cuts.

“an’ dat buck fight lak two hells,” was francois’s answer. “an’ now we
make good time. no more spitz, no more trouble, sure.”

while perrault packed the camp outfit and loaded the sled, the
dog-driver proceeded to harness the dogs. buck trotted up to the place
spitz would have occupied as leader; but francois, not noticing him,
brought sol-leks to the coveted position. in his judgment, sol-leks was
the best lead-dog left. buck sprang upon sol-leks in a fury, driving him
back and standing in his place.

“eh? eh?” francois cried, slapping his thighs gleefully. “look at dat
buck. heem keel dat spitz, heem t’ink to take de job.”

“go ‘way, chook!” he cried, but buck refused to budge.

he took buck by the scruff of the neck, and though the dog g

 buck trotted in, laughing triumphantly,
and swung around into position at the head of the team. his traces were
fastened, the sled broken out, and with both men running they dashed out
on to the river trail.

highly as the dog-driver had forevalued buck, with his two devils, he
found, while the day was yet young, that he had undervalued. at a bound
buck took up the duties of leadership; and where judgment was required,
and quick thinking and quick acting, he showed himself the superior even
of spitz, of whom francois had never seen an equal.

but it was in giving the law and making his mates live up to it, that
buck excelled. dave and sol-leks did not mind the change in leadership.
it was none of their business. their business was to toil, and toil
mightily, in the traces. so long as that were not interfered with, they
did not care what happened. billee, the good-natured, could lead for all
they cared, so long as he kept order. the rest of the team, however, had
grown unruly during the las

t days of spitz, and their surprise was great
now that buck proceeded to lick them into shape.

pike, who pulled at buck’s heels, and who never put an ounce more of his
weight against the breast-band than he was compelled to do, was swiftly
and repeatedly shaken for loafing; and ere the first day was done he was
pulling more than ever before in his life. the first night in camp,
joe, the sour one, was punished roundly--a thing that spitz had never
succeeded in doing. buck simply smothered him by virtue of superior
weight, and cut him up till he ceased snapping and began to whine for
mercy.

the general tone of the team picked up immediately. it recovered its
old-time solidarity, and once more the dogs leaped as one dog in the
traces. at the rink rapids two native huskies, teek and koona, were
added; and the celerity with which buck broke them in took away
francois’s breath.

“nevaire such a dog as dat buck!” he cried. “

 and showed his teeth they got
out of his way.

best of all, perhaps, he loved to lie near the fire, hind legs crouched
under him, fore legs stretched out in front, head raised, and eyes
blinking dreamily at the flames. sometimes he thought of judge miller’s
big house in the sun-kissed santa clara valley, and of the cement
swimming-tank, and ysabel, the mexican hairless, and toots, the japanese
pug; but oftener he remembered the man in the red sweater, the death of
curly, the great fight with spitz, and the good things he had eaten or
would like to eat. he was not homesick. the sunland was very dim and
distant, and such memories had no power over him. far more potent were
the memories of his heredity that gave things he had never seen before
a seeming familiarity; the instincts (which were but the memories of
his ancestors become habits) which had lapsed in later days, and still
later, in him, quickened and become alive again.

ogs, and he
fought as fiercely as ever and more shrewdly. skeet and nig were too
good-natured for quarrelling,--besides, they belonged to john thornton;
but the strange dog, no matter what the breed or valor, swiftly
acknowledged buck’s supremacy or found himself struggling for life with
a terrible antagonist. and buck was merciless. he had learned well the
law of club and fang, and he never forewent an advantage or drew back
from a foe he had started on the way to death. he had lessoned from
spitz, and from the chief fighting dogs of the police and mail, and knew
there was no middle course. he must master or be mastered; while to show
mercy was a weakness. mercy did not exist in the primordial life. it was
misunderstood for fear, and such misunderstandings made for death. kill
or be killed, eat or be eaten, was the law; and this mandate, down out
of the depths of time, he obeyed.

he was older than the days he had seen and the breaths he had drawn. he
linked the past with the present, an
