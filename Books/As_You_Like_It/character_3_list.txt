[CHARACTER] - 
                	a
faithful lord who accompanies duke senior into exile in the forest
of ardenne. [CHARACTER] is an example of a stock figure in elizabethan
comedy, the man possessed of a hopelessly melancholy disposition.
much like a referee in a football game, he stands on the sidelines, watching
and judging the actions of the other characters without ever fully
participating. given his inability to participate in life, it is
fitting that [CHARACTER] alone refuses to follow duke senior and the
other courtiers back to court, and instead resolves to assume a
solitary and contemplative life in a monastery.
