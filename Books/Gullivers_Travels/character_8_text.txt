not only to interpret, but to punish every thing which looked like an
_innuendo_ (as i think you call it).  but, pray how could that which i
spoke so many years ago, and at about five thousand leagues distance, in
another reign, be applied to any of the _yahoos_, who now are said to
govern the herd; especially at a time when i little thought, or feared,
the unhappiness of living under them?  have not i the most reason to
complain, when i see these very _yahoos_ carried by _houyhnhnms_ in a
vehicle, as if they were brutes, and those the rational creatures?  and
indeed to avoid so monstrous and detestable a sight was one principal
motive of my retirement hither.

thus much i thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself, and to
the trust i reposed in you.

i do, in the next place, complain of my own great want of judgment, in
being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasoning of you and
some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my travels to be

could hardly understand the new.  and i observe, when any _yahoo_ comes
from london out of curiosity to visit me at my house, we neither of us
are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner intelligible to the

if the censure of the _yahoos_ could any way affect me, i should have
great reason to complain, that some of them are so bold as to think my
book of travels a mere fiction out of mine own brain, and have gone so
far as to drop hints, that the _houyhnhnms_ and _yahoos_ have no more
existence than the inhabitants of utopia.

indeed i must confess, that as to the people of _lilliput_, _brobdingrag_
(for so the word should have been spelt, and not erroneously
_brobdingnag_), and _laputa_, i have never yet heard of any _yahoo_ so
presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts i have related
concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every reader with
conviction.  and is there less probability in my account of the

the united praise of the whole race would be of less consequence to me,
than the neighing of those two degenerate _houyhnhnms_ i keep in my

some virtues without any mixture of vice.

do these miserable animals presume to think, that i am so degenerated as
to defend my veracity?  _yahoo_ as i am, it is well known through all
_houyhnhnmland_, that, by the instructions and example of my illustrious
master, i was able in the compass of two years (although i confess with
the utmost difficulty) to remove that infernal habit of lying, shuffling,

out some toys, which travellers usually carry for presents to the savage
indians of america, and other parts, in hopes the people of the house

accommodated, as the reader shall know hereafter, when i come to treat
more particularly about my way of living.

quality come out of curiosity to see the author.  he gives his master a
short account of his voyage.

my principal endeavour was to learn the language, which my master (for so
i shall henceforth call him), and his children, and every servant of his
house, were desirous to teach me; for they looked upon it as a prodigy,
that a brute animal should discover such marks of a rational creature.  i
pointed to every thing, and inquired the name of it, which i wrote down
in my journal-book when i was

 in the neighbourhood came often to our house, upon the
report spread of ‚Äúa wonderful _yahoo_, that could speak like a
_houyhnhnm_, and seemed, in his words and actions, to discover some
glimmerings of reason.‚Äù  these delighted to converse with me: they put
many questions, and received such answers as i was able to return.  by
all these advantages i made so great a progress, that, in five months
from my arrival i understood whatever was spoken, and could express
myself tolerably well.

the _houyhnhnms_, who came to visit my master out of a design of seeing
and talking with me, could hardly believe me to be a right _yahoo_,
because my body had a different covering from others of my kind.  they
were astonished to observe me without the usual hair or skin, except on
my head, face, and hands; but i discovered that secret to my master upon
an accident which happened about a fortnight before.

i have already told the reader, that every night, when the family were
gone to bed, it was my custom to s

seas in a great hollow vessel made of wood, and larger than his honour‚Äôs
house.  i described the ship to him in the best terms i could, and
explained, by the help of my handkerchief displayed, how it was driven
forward by the wind.  that upon a quarrel among us, i was set on shore on
this coast, where i walked forward, without knowing whither, till he
delivered me from the persecution of those execrable _yahoos_.‚Äù  he asked
me, ‚Äúwho made the ship, and how it was possible that the _houyhnhnms_ of
my country would leave it to the management of brutes?‚Äù  my answer was,
‚Äúthat i durst proceed no further in my relation, unless he would give me
his word and honour that he would not be offended, and then i would tell
him the wonders i had so often promised.‚Äù  he agreed; and i went on by
assuring him, that the ship was made by creatures like myself; who, in
all the countries i had travelled, as well as in my own, were the only
governing rational animals; and that upon my arrival hithe

r, i was as
much astonished to see the _houyhnhnms_ act like rational beings, as he,
or his friends, could be, in finding some marks of reason in a creature
he was pleased to call a _yahoo_; to which i owned my resemblance in
every part, but could not account for their degenerate and brutal nature.
i said farther, ‚Äúthat if good fortune ever restored me to my native
country, to relate my travels hither, as i resolved to do, everybody
would believe, that i said the thing that was not, that i invented the
story out of my own head; and (with all

, that he leaves me worse than in
ignorance; for i am led to believe a thing black, when it is white, and
short, when it is long.‚Äù  and these were all the notions he had
concerning that faculty of lying, so perfectly well understood, and so
universally practised, among human creatures.

to return from this digression.  when i asserted that the _yahoos_ were
the only governing animals in my country, which my master said was
altogether past his conception, he desired to know, ‚Äúwhether we had
_houyhnhnms_ among us, and what was their employment?‚Äù  i told him, ‚Äúwe
had great numbers; that in summer they grazed in the fields, and in
winter were kept in houses with hay and oats, where _yahoo_ servants were
employed to rub their skins smooth, comb their manes, pick their feet,
serve them with food, and make their beds.‚Äù  ‚Äúi understand you well,‚Äù
said my master: ‚Äúit is now very plain, from all you have spoken, that
whatever share of reason the _yahoos_ pretend to, the _houyhnhnms_ are

begged ‚Äúhis honour would please to excuse me from proceeding any further,
because i was very certain that the account he expected from me would be
highly displeasing.‚Äù  but he insisted in commanding me to let him know
the best and the worst.  i told him ‚Äúhe should be obeyed.‚Äù  i owned ‚Äúthat
the _houyhnhnms_ among us, whom we called horses, were the most generous
and comely animals we had; that they excelled in strength and swiftness;
and when they belonged to persons of quality, were employed in
travelling, racing, or drawing chariots; they were treated with much
kindness and care, till they fell into diseases, or became foundered in
the feet; but then they were sold, and used to all kind of drudgery till
they died; after which their skins were stripped, and sold for what they
were worth, and the

Äúthat he was sure i must have been born of some noble family,
because i far exceeded in shape, colour, and cleanliness, all the
_yahoos_ of his nation, although i seemed to fail in strength and
agility, which must be imputed to my different way of living from those
other brutes; and besides i was not only endowed with the faculty of
speech, but likewise with some rudiments of reason, to a degree that,
with all his acquaintance, i passed for a prodigy.‚Äù

he made me observe, ‚Äúthat among the _houyhnhnms_, the white, the sorrel,
and the iron-gray, were not so exactly shaped as the bay, the
dapple-gray, and the black; nor born with equal talents of mind, or a
capacity to improve them; and therefore continued always in the condition
of servants, without ever aspiring to match out of their own race, which
in that country would be reckoned monstrous and unnatural.‚Äù

i made his honour my most humble acknowledgments for the good opinion he
was pleased to conceive of me, but assured him at the same

to me, that i determined upon sacrificing every thing to it.

let me deal so candidly with the reader as to confess that there was yet
a much stronger motive for the freedom i took in my representation of
things.  i had not yet been a year in this country before i contracted
such a love and veneration for the inhabitants, that i entered on a firm
resolution never to return to humankind, but to pass the rest of my life
among these admirable _houyhnhnms_, in the contemplation and practice of
every virtue, where i could have no example or incitement to vice.  but
it was decreed by fortune, my perpetual enemy, that so great a felicity
should not fall to my share.  however, it is now some comfort to reflect,
that in what i said of my countrymen, i extenuated their faults as much
as i durst before so strict an examiner; and upon every article gave as
favourable a turn as the matter would bear.  for, indeed, who is there

freely recommend it to my countrymen for the public good, as an admirable
specific against all diseases produced by repletion.

‚Äúas to learning, government, arts, manufactures, and the like,‚Äù my master
confessed, ‚Äúhe could find little or no resemblance between the _yahoos_
of that country and those in ours; for he only meant to observe what
parity there was in our natures.  he had heard, indeed, some curious
_houyhnhnms_ observe, that in most herds there was a sort of ruling
_yahoo_ (as among us there is generally some leading or principal stag in
a park), who was always more deformed in body, and mischievous in
disposition, than any of the rest; that this leader had usually a
favourite as like himself as he could get, whose employment was to lick
his master‚Äôs feet and posteriors, and drive the female _yahoos_ to his
kennel; for which he was now and then rewarded with a piece of ass‚Äôs
flesh.  this favourit

he rudiments of lewdness, coquetry, censure, and scandal, should
have place by instinct in womankind.

i expected every moment that my master would accuse the _yahoos_ of those
unnatural appetites in both sexes, so common among us.  but nature, it
seems, has not been so expert a school-mistress; and these politer
pleasures are entirely the productions of art and reason on our side of
the globe.



chapter viii.


the author relates several particulars of the _yahoos_.  the great
virtues of the _houyhnhnms_.  the education and exercise of their youth.
their general assembly.

as i ought to have understood human nature much better than i supposed it
possible for my master to do, so it was easy to apply the character he
gave of the _yahoos_ to myself and my countrymen; and i believed i could
yet make further discoveries, from my own observation.  i therefore often
begged his honour to let me go among the herds of _yahoos_ in the
neighbourhood; to which he always very graciously consented, being

of all animals: their capacity never reaching higher than to draw or
carry burdens.  yet i am of opinion, this defect arises chiefly from a
perverse, restive disposition; for they are cunning, malicious,
treacherous, and revengeful.  they are strong and hardy, but of a
cowardly spirit, and, by consequence, insolent, abject, and cruel.  it is
observed, that the red haired of both sexes are more libidinous and
mischievous than the rest, whom yet they much exceed in strength and
activity.

the _houyhnhnms_ keep the _yahoos_ for present use in huts not far from
the house; but the rest are sent abroad to certain fields, where they dig
up roots, eat several kinds of herbs, and search about for carrion, or
sometimes catch weasels and _luhimuhs_ (a sort of wild rat), which they
greedily devour.  nature has taught them to dig deep holes with their
nails on the side of a rising ground, wherein they lie by themselves;
only the kennels of the females are larger, sufficient to hold two or
three cubs.

d colour (which might have been some excuse for an
appetite a little irregular), but black as a sloe, and her countenance
did not make an appearance altogether so hideous as the rest of her kind;
for i think she could not be above eleven years old.

having lived three years in this country, the reader, i suppose, will
expect that i should, like other travellers, give him some account of the
manners and customs of its inhabitants, which it was indeed my principal
study to learn.

as these noble _houyhnhnms_ are endowed by nature with a general
disposition to all virtues, and have no conceptions or ideas of what is
evil in a rational creature, so their grand maxim is, to cultivate
reason, and to be wholly governed by it.  neither is reason among them a
point problematical, as with us, where men can argue with plausibility on
both sides of the question, but strikes you with immediate conviction; as
it must needs do, where it is not mingled, obscured, or discoloured, by
passion and interest.  i reme

mber it was with extreme difficulty that i
could bring my master to understand the meaning of the word opinion, or
how a point could be disputable; because reason taught us to affirm or
deny only where we are certain; and beyond our knowledge we cannot do
either.  so that controversies, wranglings, disputes, and positiveness,
in false or dubious propositions, are evils unknown among the
_houyhnhnms_.  in the like manner, when i used to explain to him our
several systems of natural philosophy, he would laugh, ‚Äúthat a creature
pretending to reason, should value itself upon the knowledge of other
people‚Äôs conjectures, and in things where that knowledge, if it were
certain, could be of no use.‚Äù  wherein he agreed entirely with the
sentiments of socrates, as plato delivers them; which i mention as the
highest honour i can do that prince of philosophers.  i have often since
reflected, wha

t destruction such doctrine would make in the libraries of
europe; and how many paths of fame would be then shut up in the learned
world.

friendship and benevolence are the two principal virtues among the
_houyhnhnms_; and these not confined to particular objects, but universal
to the whole race; for a stranger from the remotest part is equally
treated with the nearest neighbour, and wherever he goes, looks upon
himself as at home.  they preserve decency and civility in the highest
degrees, but are altogether ignorant of ceremony.  they have no fondness
for their colts or foals, but the care they take in educating them
proceeds entirely from the dictates of reason.  and i observed my master
to show the same
 
 ___________________________
 
 affection to his neighbour‚Äôs issue, that he had for his
own.  they will have it that nature teaches them to love the whole
species, and it is reason only that makes a distinction of persons, where
there is a superior degree of virtue.

when the matron _houyhnhnms_ have produced one of each sex, they no
longer accompany with their consorts, except they lose one of their issue
by some casualty, which very seldom happens; but in such a case they meet
again; or when the like accident befalls a person whose wife is past
bearing, some other couple bestow on him one of their own colts, and then
go together again until the mother is pregnant.  this caution is
necessary, to prevent the country from being overburdened with numbers.
but the race of inferior _houyh
 
 ___________________________
 
e, industry, exercise, and cleanliness, are the lessons equally
enjoined to the young ones of both sexes: and my master thought it
monstrous in us, to give the females a different kind of education from
the males, except in some articles of domestic management; whereby, as he
truly observed, one half of our natives were good for nothing but
bringing children into the world; and to trust the care of our children
to such useless animals, he said, was yet a greater instance of
brutality.

but the _houyhnhnms_ train up their youth to strength, speed, and
hardiness, by exercising them in running races up and down steep hills,
and over hard stony grounds; and when they are all in a sweat, they are
ordered to leap over head and ears into a pond or river.  four times a
year the youth of a certain district meet to show their proficiency in
running and leaping, and other feats of strength and agility; where the
victor is rewarded with a song in his or her praise.  on this festival,
the servants drive a he

rd of _yahoos_ into the field, laden with hay, and
oats, and milk, for a repast to the _houyhnhnms_; after which, these
brutes are immediately driven back again, for fear of being noisome to
the assembly.

every fourth year, at the vernal equinox, there is a representative
council of the whole nation, which meets in a plain about twenty miles
from our house, and continues about five or six days.  here they inquire
into the state and condition of the several districts; whether they
abound or be deficient in hay or oats, or cows, or _yahoos_; and wherever
there is any want (which is but seldom
 
 ___________________________
 
) it is immediately supplied by
unanimous consent and contribution.  here likewise the regulation of
children is settled: as for instance, if a _houyhnhnm_ has two males, he
changes one of them with another that has two females; and when a child
has been lost by any casualty, where the mother is past breeding, it is
determined what family in the district shall breed another to supply the
loss.



chapter ix.


a grand debate at the general assembly of the _houyhnhnms_, and how it
was determined.  the learning of the _houyhnhnms_.  their buildings.
their manner of burials.  the defectiveness of their language.

one of these grand assemblies was held in my time, about three months
before my departure, whither my master went as the representative of our
district.  in this council was resumed their old debate, and indeed the
only debate that ever happened in their country; whereof my master, after
his return, give me a very particular account.

the question to 
 
 ___________________________
 
be debated was, ‚Äúwhether the _yahoos_ should be
exterminated from the face of the earth?‚Äù  one of the members for the
affirmative offered several arguments of great strength and weight,
alleging, ‚Äúthat as the _yahoos_ were the most filthy, noisome, and
deformed animals which nature ever produced, so they were the most
restive and indocible, mischievous and malicious; they would privately
suck the teats of the _houyhnhnms‚Äô_ cows, kill and devour their cats,
trample down their oats and grass, if they were not continually watched,
and commit a thousand other extravagancies.‚Äù  he took notice of a general
tradition, ‚Äúthat _yahoos_ had not been always in their country; but that
many ages ago, two of these brutes appeared together upon a mountain;
whether produced by the heat of the sun upon corrupted mud and slime, or
from the ooze and froth of the sea, was never known; that these _yahoos_
engendered, and their
 
 ___________________________
 
 brood, in a short time, grew so numerous as to
overrun and infest the whole nation; that the _houyhnhnms_, to get rid of
this evil, made a general hunting, and at last enclosed the whole herd;
and destroying the elder, every _houyhnhnm_ kept two young ones in a
kennel, and brought them to such a degree of tameness, as an animal, so
savage by nature, can be capable of acquiring, using them for draught and
carriage; that there seemed to be much truth in this tradition, and that
those creatures could not be _yinhniamshy_ (or _aborigines_ of the land),
because of the violent hatred the _houyhnhnms_, a

h an artificial composure of the skins and hairs of other
animals; that i spoke in a language of my own, and had thoroughly learned
theirs; that i had related to him the accidents which brought me thither;
that when he saw me without my covering, i was an exact _yahoo_ in every
part, only of a whiter colour, less hairy, and with shorter claws.  he
added, how i had endeavoured to persuade him, that in my own and other
countries, the _yahoos_ acted as the governing, rational animal, and held
the _houyhnhnms_ in servitude; that he observed in me all the qualities
of a _yahoo_, only a little more civilized by some tincture of reason,
which, however, was in a degree as far inferior to the _houyhnhnm_ race,
as the _yahoos_ of their country were to me; that, among other things, i
mentioned a custom we had of castrating _houyhnhnms_ when they were
young, in order to render them tame; that the operation was easy and
safe; that it was no shame to learn wisdom from brutes, as industry is
taught by the ant,
 
 ___________________________
 
 and building by the swallow (for so i translate the
word _lyhannh_, although it be a much larger fowl); that this invention
might be practised upon the younger _yahoos_ here, which besides
rendering them tractable and fitter for use, would in an age put an end
to the whole species, without destroying life; that in the mean time the
_houyhnhnms_ should be exhorted to cultivate the breed of asses, which,
as they are in all respects more valuable brutes, so they have this
advantage, to be fit for service at five years old, which the others are
not till twelve.‚Äù

this was all my master thought fit to tell me, at that time, of what
passed in the grand council.  but he was pleased to conceal one
particular, which related personally to myself, whereof i soon felt the
unhappy effect, as the reader will know in its proper place, and whence 
 
 ___________________________
 
i
date all the succeeding misfortunes of my life.

the _houyhnhnms_ have no letters, and consequently their knowledge is all
traditional.  but there happening few events of any moment among a people
so well united, naturally disposed to every virtue, wholly governed by
reason, and cut off from all commerce with other nations, the historical
part is easily preserved without burdening their memories.  i have
already observed that they are subject to no diseases, and therefore can
have no need of physicians.  however, they have excellent medicines,
composed of he
 
 ___________________________
 
both of these, and usually contain either some exalted notions of
friendship and benevolence or the praises of those who were victors in
races and other bodily exercises.  their buildings, although very rude
and simple, are not inconvenient, but well contrived to defend them from
all injuries of cold and heat.  they have a kind of tree, which at forty
years old loosens in the root, and falls with the first storm: it grows
very straight, and being pointed like stakes with a sharp stone (for the
_houyhnhnms_ know not the use of iron), they stick them erect in the
ground, about ten inches asunder, and then weave in oat straw, or
sometimes wattles, between them.  the roof is made after the same manner,
and so are the doors.

the _houyhnhnms_ use the hollow part, between the pastern and the hoof of
their fore-foot, as we do our hands, and this with greater dexterity than
i could at first imagine.  i have seen a white mare of our family thread
a needle (which i lent her on purpose) with that joint.  t

much visited by their friends,
because they cannot go abroad with their usual ease and satisfaction.
however, about ten days before their death, which they seldom fail in
computing, they return the visits that have been made them by those who
are nearest in the neighbourhood, being carried in a convenient sledge
drawn by _yahoos_; which vehicle they use, not only upon this occasion,
but when they grow old, upon long journeys, or when they are lamed by any
accident: and therefore when the dying _houyhnhnms_ return those visits,
they take a solemn leave of their friends, as if they were going to some
remote part of the country, where they designed to pass the rest of their
lives.

i know not whether it may be worth observing, that the _houyhnhnms_ have
no word in their language to express any thing that is evil, except what
they borrow from the deformities or ill qualities of the _yahoos_.  thus
they denote the folly of a servant, an omission of a child, a stone that
cuts their feet, a continuance

i could, with great pleasure, enlarge further upon the manners and
virtues of this excellent people; but intending in a short time to
publish a volume by itself, expressly upon that subject, i refer the
reader thither; and, in the mean time, proceed to relate my own sad
catastrophe.

improvement in virtue by conversing with them.  their conversations.  the
author has notice given him by his master, that he must depart from the
country.  he falls into a swoon for grief; but submits.  he contrives and
finishes a canoe by the help of a fellow-servant, and puts to sea at a
venture.

i had settled my little economy to my own heart‚Äôs content.  my master had
ordered a room to be made for me, after their manner, about six yards
from the house: the sides and floors of

eating shopkeepers or mechanics; no
pride, vanity, or affectation; no fops, bullies, drunkards, strolling
whores, or poxes; no ranting, lewd, expensive wives; no stupid, proud

conceited, swearing companions; no scoundrels raised from the dust upon
the merit of their vices, or nobility thrown into it on account of their
virtues; no lords, fiddlers, judges, or dancing-masters.

i had the favour of being admitted to several _houyhnhnms_, who came to
visit or dine with my master; where his honour graciously suffered me to
wait in the room, and listen to their discourse.  both he and his company
would often descend to ask me questions, and receive my answers.  i had
also sometimes the honour of attending my master in his visits to others.
i never presumed to speak, except in answer to a question; and then i did
it with inward regret, because it was a loss of so much time for
improving myself; but i was infinitely delighted with

in shape and
disposition, perhaps a little more civilized, and qualified with the gift
of speech; but making no other use of reason, than to improve and
multiply those vices whereof their brethren in this country had only the
share that nature allotted them.  when i happened to behold the
reflection of my own form in a lake or fountain, i turned away my face in
horror and detestation of myself, and could better endure the sight of a
common _yahoo_ than of my own person.  by conversing with the
_houyhnhnms_, and looking upon them with delight, i fell to imitate their
gait and gesture, which is now grown into a habit; and my friends often
tell me, in a blunt way, ‚Äúthat i trot like a horse;‚Äù which, however, i

am apt to fall into the voice and manner of the _houyhnhnms_, and hear
myself ridiculed on that account, without the least mortification.

_houyhnhnm_ than a brute animal; that he was known frequently to converse
with me, as if he could receive some advantage or pleasure in my company;
that such a practice was not agreeable to reason or nature, or a thing
ever heard of before among them; the assembly did therefore exhort him
either to employ me like the rest of my species, or command me to swim
back to the place whence i came: that the first of these expedients was
utterly rejected by all the _houyhnhnms_ who had ever seen me at his
house or their own; for they alleged, that because i had some rudiments
of reason, added to the natural pravity of those animals, it was to be
feared i might be able to seduce them into the woody and mountainous
parts of the country, and bring them in troops by night to destroy the
_houyhnhnms‚Äô_ cattle, as being naturally of the ravenous kind, and averse
from labour.‚Äù

my master added, ‚Äúthat he was daily pressed by the _houyhnhnms_ of the
neighbourhood to have

of vehicle, resembling those i had described to him, that might carry me
on the sea; in which work i should have the assistance of his own
servants, as well as those of his neighbours.‚Äù  he concluded, ‚Äúthat for
his own part, he could have been content to keep me in his service as
long as i lived; because he found i had cured myself of some bad habits
and dispositions, by endeavouring, as far as my inferior nature was
capable, to imitate the _houyhnhnms_.‚Äù

i should here observe to the reader, that a decree of the general
assembly in this country is expressed by the word _hnhloayn_, which
signifies an exhortation, as near as i can render it; for they have no
conception how a rational creature can be compelled, but only advised, or
exhorted; because no person can disobey reason, without giving up his
claim to be a rational creature.

and therefore looked on myself as already devoted to destruction; that
the certain prospect of an unnatural death was the least of my evils;
for, supposing i should escape with life by some strange adventure, how
could i think with temper of passing my days among _yahoos_, and
relapsing into my old corruptions, for want of examples to lead and keep
me within the paths of virtue? that i knew too well upon what solid
reasons all the determinations of the wise _houyhnhnms_ were founded, not
to be shaken by arguments of mine, a miserable _yahoo_; and therefore,
after presenting him with my humble thanks for the offer of his servants‚Äô
assistance in making a vessel, and desiring a reasonable time for so
difficult a work, i told him i would endeavour to preserve a wretched
being; and if ever i returned to england, was not without hopes of being
useful to my own species, by celebrating the praises of the renowned
_houyhnhnms_, and proposing their virtues to the imi

detractors are pleased to think it improbable, that so illustrious a

travellers are to boast of extraordinary favours they have received.

 design was, if possible, to discover some small island uninhabited,
yet sufficient, by my labour, to furnish me with the necessaries of life,
which i would have thought a greater happiness, than to be first minister
in the politest court of europe; so horrible was the idea i conceived of
returning to live in the society, and under the government of _yahoos_.
for in such a solitude as i desired, i could at least enjoy my own
thoughts, and reflect with delight on the virtues of those inimitable
_houyhnhnms_, without an opportunity of degenerating into the vices and
corruptions of my own species.

the reader may remember what i related, when my crew conspired against
me, and confined me to my cabin; how i continued there several weeks
without knowing what course we took; and when i was put ashore in the
long-boat, how the sailors told me, with oaths, whether true or false,

behind the stone.  they gazed awhile in admiration at my strange uncouth
dress; my coat made of skins, my wooden-soled shoes, and my furred
stockings; whence, however, they concluded, i was not a native of the
place, who all go naked.  one of the seamen, in portuguese, bid me rise,
and asked who i was.  i understood that language very well, and getting
upon my feet, said, ‚Äúi was a poor _yahoo_ banished from the _houyhnhnms_,
and desired they would please to let me depart.‚Äù  they admired to hear me
answer them in their own tongue, and saw by my complexion i must be a
european; but were at a loss to know what i meant by _yahoos_ and
_houyhnhnms_; and at the same time fell a-laughing at my strange tone in
speaking, which resembled the neighing of a horse.  i trembled all the
while betwixt fear and hatred.  i again desired leave to depart, and was
gently moving to my canoe; but they laid hold of me, desiring to kno

we arrived at lisbon, nov. 5, 1715.  at our landing, the captain forced
me to cover myself with his cloak, to prevent the rabble from crowding
about me.  i was conveyed to his own house; and at my earnest request he
led me up to the highest room backwards.  i conjured him ‚Äúto conceal from
all persons what i had told him of the _houyhnhnms_; because the least
hint of such a story would not only draw numbers of people to see me, but
probably put me in danger of being imprisoned, or burnt by the
inquisition.‚Äù  the captain persuaded me to accept a suit of clothes newly
made; but i would not suffer the tailor to take my measure; however, don
pedro being almost of my size, they fitted me well enough.  he accoutred
me with other necessaries, all new, which i aired for twenty-four hours
before i would use them.

ith great surprise and joy, because they
concluded me certainly dead; but i must freely confess the sight of them
filled me only with hatred, disgust, and contempt; and the more, by
reflecting on the near alliance i had to them.  for although, since my
unfortunate exile from the _houyhnhnm_ country, i had compelled myself to
tolerate the sight of _yahoos_, and to converse with don pedro de mendez,
yet my memory and imagination were perpetually filled with the virtues
and ideas of those exalted _houyhnhnms_.  and when i began to consider
that, by copulating with one of the _yahoo_ species i had become a parent
of more, it struck me with the utmost shame, confusion, and horror.

as soon as i entered the house, my wife took me in her arms, and kissed
me; at which, having not been used to the touch of that odious animal for
so many years, i fell into a swoon for almost an hour.  at the time i am
writing, it is five years since my last return to england.  during the
first year, i could not endure my

eat disgust against this part of
reading, and some indignation to see the credulity of mankind so
impudently abused.  therefore, since my acquaintance were pleased to
think my poor endeavours might not be unacceptable to my country, i
imposed on myself, as a maxim never to be swerved from, that i would
strictly adhere to truth; neither indeed can i be ever under the least
temptation to vary from it, while i retain in my mind the lectures and
example of my noble master and the other illustrious _houyhnhnms_ of whom
i had so long the honour to be an humble hearer.

i know very well, how little reputation is to be got by writings which
require neither genius nor learning, nor indeed any other talent, except
a good memory, or an exact journal.  i know likewise, that writers of
travels, like dictionary-makers, are sunk into oblivion by the weight and
bulk of those who come last, and therefore lie upper

such travellers, who shall hereafter visit the
countries described in this work of mine, may, by detecting my errors (if
there be any), and adding many new discoveries of their own, justle me
out of vogue, and stand in my place, making the world forget that ever i
was an author.  this indeed would be too great a mortification, if i
wrote for fame: but as my sole intention was the public good, i cannot be
altogether disappointed.  for who can read of the virtues i have
mentioned in the glorious _houyhnhnms_, without being ashamed of his own
vices, when he considers himself as the reasoning, governing animal of
his country?  i shall say nothing of those remote nations where _yahoos_
preside; among which the least corrupted are the _brobdingnagians_; whose
wise maxims in morality and government it would be our happiness to
observe.  but i forbear descanting further, and rather leave the
judicious reader to his own remarks and application.

writers of travels are often too justly charged.  besides, i meddle not
the least with any party, but write without passion, prejudice, or
ill-will against any man, or number of men, whatsoever.  i write for the
noblest end, to inform and instruct mankind; over whom i may, without
breach of modesty, pretend to some superiority, from the advantages i
received by conversing so long among the most accomplished _houyhnhnms_.
i write without any view to profit or praise.  i never suffer a word to
pass that may look like reflection, or possibly give the least offence,
even to those who are most ready to take it.  so that i hope i may with
justice pronounce myself an author perfectly blameless; against whom the
tribes of answerers, considerers, observers, reflectors, detectors,
remarkers, will never be able to find matter for exercising their
talents.

countries i treat of would be as easy as those of ferdinando cortez over
the naked americans.  the _lilliputians_, i think, are hardly worth the
charge of a fleet and army to reduce them; and i question whether it
might be prudent or safe to attempt the _brobdingnagians_; or whether an
english army would be much at their ease with the flying island over
their heads.  the _houyhnhnms_ indeed appear not to be so well prepared
for war, a science to which they are perfect strangers, and especially
against missive weapons.  however, supposing myself to be a minister of
state, i could never give my advice for invading them.  their prudence,
unanimity, unacquaintedness with fear, and their love of their country,
would amply supply all defects in the military art.  imagine twenty
thousand of them breaking into the midst of an european army, confounding
the ranks, overturning the c

stood, i should perhaps, in point of prudence and self-preservation, have
put it off to a better opportunity.

having thus answered the only objection that can ever be raised against
me as a traveller, i here take a final leave of all my courteous readers,
and return to enjoy my own speculations in my little garden at redriff;

and thus, if possible, habituate myself by time to tolerate the sight of
a human creature; to lament the brutality to _houyhnhnms_ in my own
country, but always treat their persons with respect, for the sake of my
noble master, his family, his friends, and the whole _houyhnhnm_ race,
whom these of ours have the honour to resemble in all their lineaments,

of things: but when i behold a lump of deformity and diseases, both in
body and mind, smitten with pride, it immediately breaks all the measures

animal, and such a vice, could tally together.  the wise and virtuous
_houyhnhnms_, who abound in all excellences that can adorn a rational
creature, have no name for this vice in their language, which has no
terms to express any thing that is evil, except those whereby they
describe the detestable qualities of their _yahoos_, among which they
were not able to distinguish this of pride, for want of thoroughly
understanding human nature, as it shows itself in other countries where
that animal presides.  but i, who had more experience, could plainly

more proud of the good qualities they possess, than i should be for not
wanting a leg or an arm; which no man in his wits would boast of,
although he must be miserable without them.  i dwell the longer upon this
subject from the desire i have to make the society of an english _yahoo_
by any means not insupportable; and therefore i here entreat those who
have any tincture of this absurd vice, that they will not presume to come
in my sight.
