james, she kept a feeler on her surroundings lest some one should creep
up, and suddenly she should find her picture looked at. but now, with all
her senses quickened as they were, looking, straining, till the colour of
the wall and the jacmanna beyond burnt into her eyes, she was aware of
someone coming out of the house, coming towards her; but somehow divined,
from the footfall, william bankes, so that though her brush quivered, she
did not, as she would have done had it been mr. tansley, paul rayley,
minta doyle, or practically anybody else, turn her canvas upon the grass,
but let it stand. william bankes stood beside her.

they had rooms in the village, and so, walking in, walking out, parting
late on door-mats, had said little things about the soup, about the
children, about one thing and another which made them allies; so that when
he stood beside her now in his judicial way (he was old enough to be her
father too, a botanist, a widower, smelling of soap, very scrupulous and
clean) she

 give the cook? mrs. ramsay wondered. and indeed it
was only by waiting patiently, and hearing that there was an old woman in
the kitchen with very red cheeks, drinking soup out of a basin, that
mrs. ramsay at last prompted that parrot-like instinct which had picked up
mildred's words quite accurately and could now produce them, if one
waited, in a colourless singsong. shifting from foot to foot, cam
repeated the words, "no, they haven't, and i've told ellen to clear away
tea."

minta doyle and paul rayley had not come back then. that could only
mean, mrs. ramsay thought, one thing. she must accept him, or she must
refuse him. this going off after luncheon for a walk, even though
andrew was with them--what could it mean? except that she had decided,
rightly, mrs. ramsay thought (and she was very, very fond of minta), to
accept that good fellow, who might not be brilliant, but then, thought
mrs. ramsay, realising that james was tugging at her, to make her go on
reading aloud the fisherman and his

en, you shall go through it all. to eight people she
had said relentlessly that (and the bill for the greenhouse would be
fifty pounds). for that reason, knowing what was before them--love and
ambition and being wretched alone in dreary places--she had often the
feeling, why must they grow up and lose it all? and then she said to
herself, brandishing her sword at life, nonsense. they will be
perfectly happy. and here she was, she reflected, feeling life rather
sinister again, making minta marry paul rayley; because whatever she
might feel about her own transaction, she had had experiences which
need not happen to every one (she did not name them to herself); she
was driven on, too quickly she knew, almost as if it were an escape for
her too, to say that people must marry; people must have children.

was she wrong in this, she asked herself, reviewing her conduct for the
past week or two, and wondering if she had indeed put any pressure upon
minta, who was only twenty-four, to make up her mind. sh

er's brooch, the sole ornament she possessed--a weeping
willow, it was (they must remember it) set in pearls. they must have
seen it, she said, with the tears running down her cheeks, the
brooch which her grandmother had fastened her cap with till the
last day of her life. now she had lost it. she would rather have
lost anything than that! she would go back and look for it. they all
went back. they poked and peered and looked. they kept their heads
very low, and said things shortly and gruffly. paul rayley searched
like a madman all about the rock where they had been sitting. all this
pother about a brooch really didn't do at all, andrew thought, as paul
told him to make a "thorough search between this point and that." the
tide was coming in fast. the sea would cover the place where they had
sat in a minute. there was not a ghost of a chance of their finding it
now. "we shall be cut off!" minta shrieked, suddenly terrified. as if
there were any danger of that! it was the same as the bulls all ove

but what have i done with my life? thought mrs. ramsay, taking her
place at the head of the table, and looking at all the plates making
white circles on it. "william, sit by me," she said. "lily," she
said, wearily, "over there." they had that--paul rayley and minta
doyle--she, only this--an infinitely long table and plates and knives.
at the far end was her husband, sitting down, all in a heap, frowning.
what at? she did not know. she did not mind. she could not
understand how she had ever felt any emotion or affection for him. she
had a sense of being past everything, through everything, out of
everything, as she helped the soup, as if there was an eddy--there--
and one could be in it, or one could be out of it, and she was out of
it. it's all

analyse the cause of the sudden exhilaration,
compared it with that moment on the tennis lawn, when solidity suddenly
vanished, and such vast spaces lay between them; and now the same
effect was got by the many candles in the sparely furnished room, and
the uncurtained windows, and the bright mask-like look of faces seen by
candlelight. some weight was taken off them; anything might happen,
she felt. they must come now, mrs. ramsay thought, looking at the door,
and at that instant, minta doyle, paul rayley, and a maid carrying a
great dish in her hands came in together. they were awfully late; they
were horribly late, minta said, as they found their way to different
ends of the table.

"i lost my brooch--my grandmother's brooch," said minta with a sound of
lamentation in her voice, and a suffusion in her large brown eyes,
looking down, looking up, as she sat by mr. ramsay, which roused his
chivalry so that he bantered her.

how could she be such a goose, he asked, as to scramble about the rocks

tening about her. she was irresistible.
always she got her own way in the end, lily thought. now she had
brought this off--paul and minta, one might suppose, were engaged. mr.
bankes was dining here. she put a spell on them all, by wishing, so
simply, so directly, and lily contrasted that abundance with her own
poverty of spirit, and supposed that it was partly that belief (for her
face was all lit up--without looking young, she looked radiant) in this
strange, this terrifying thing, which made paul rayley, sitting at her
side, all of a tremor, yet abstract, absorbed, silent. mrs. ramsay,
lily felt, as she talked about the skins of vegetables, exalted that,
worshipped that; held her hands over it to warm them, to protect it,
and yet, having brought it all about, somehow laughed, led her victims,
lily felt, to the altar. it came over her too now--the emotion, the
vibration, of love. how inconspicuous she felt herself by paul's side!

purposely, however, for she had it on her mind that lily, who had
helped her with mr. tansley, was out of things, she exempted her from
the rest; said "lily anyhow agrees with me," and so drew her in, a
little fluttered, a little startled. (for she was thinking about
love.) they were both out of things, mrs. ramsay had been thinking,
both lily and charles tansley. both suffered from the glow of the
other two. he, it was clear, felt himself utterly in the cold; no
woman would look at him with paul rayley in the room. poor fellow!
still, he had his dissertation, the influence of somebody upon
something: he could take care of himself. with lily it was different.
she faded, under minta's glow; became more inconspicuous than ever, in
her little grey dress with her little puckered face and her little
chinese eyes. everything about her was so small. yet, thought mrs.
ramsay, comparing her with minta, as she claimed her help (for lily

liked it as much as they said they did. but, he added, there is
considerable merit in some of the plays nevertheless, and mrs. ramsay
saw that it would be all right for the moment anyhow; he would laugh at
minta, and she, mrs. ramsay saw, realising his extreme anxiety about
himself, would, in her own way, see that he was taken care of, and
praise him, somehow or other. but she wished it was not necessary:
perhaps it was her fault that it was necessary. anyhow, she was free
now to listen to what paul rayley was trying to say about books one had
read as a boy. they lasted, he said. he had read some of tolstoi at
school. there was one he always remembered, but he had forgotten the
name. russian names were impossible, said mrs. ramsay. "vronsky," said
paul. he remembered that because he always thought it such a good name
for a villain. "vronsky," said mrs. ramsay; "oh, anna karenina," but
that did not take them very far; books were not in their line. no,
charles tansley would put them both right in a

appy, when i go to see him, to find nothing
nice in his house--no one to arrange the flowers." so they were sent
for walks together, and she was told, with that faint touch of irony
that made mrs. ramsay slip through one's fingers, that she had a
scientific mind; she liked flowers; she was so exact. what was this
mania of hers for marriage? lily wondered, stepping to and fro from
her easel.

(suddenly, as suddenly as a star slides in the sky, a reddish light
seemed to burn in her mind, covering paul rayley, issuing from him. it
rose like a fire sent up in token of some celebration by savages on a
distant beach. she heard the roar and the crackle. the whole sea for
miles round ran red and gold. some winey smell mixed with it and
intoxicated her, for she felt again her own headlong desire to throw
herself off the cliff and be drowned looking for a pearl brooch on a
beach. and the roar and the crackle repelled her with fear and
disgust, as if while she saw its splendour and power she saw too how it

relationship. it was no monotony of bliss--she with her impulses and
quicknesses; he with his shudders and glooms. oh, no. the bedroom door
would slam violently early in the morning. he would start from the
table in a temper. he would whizz his plate through the window. then
all through the house there would be a sense of doors slamming and
blinds fluttering, as if a gusty wind were blowing and people scudded
about trying in a hasty way to fasten hatches and make things ship-
shape. she had met paul rayley like that one day on the stairs.
they had laughed and laughed, like a couple of children, all because
mr. ramsay, finding an earwig in his milk at breakfast had sent the
whole thing flying through the air on to the terrace outside. 'an earwig,
prue murmured, awestruck, 'in his milk.' other people might find
centipedes. but he had built round him such a fence of sanctity, and
occupied the space with such a demeanour of majesty that an earwig
in his milk was a monster.

but it tired mrs. ramsay,
