  salisbury. lords, i will meet him at saint edmundsbury;
    it is our safety, and we must embrace
    this gentle offer of the perilous time.
  pembroke. who brought that letter from the cardinal?
  salisbury. the count melun, a noble lord of france,
    whose private with me of the dauphin's love
    is much more general than these lines import.
  bigot. to-morrow morning let us meet him then.
  salisbury. or rather then set forward; for 'twill be
    two long days' journey, lords, or ere we meet.

  king john. have thou the ordering of this present time.

  lewis. my lord melun, let this be copied out
    and keep it safe for our remembrance;
    return the precedent to these lords again,
    that, having our fair order written down,
    both they and we, perusing o'er these notes,
    may know wherefore we took the sacrament,
    and keep our faiths firm and inviolable.

  salisbury. i did not think the king so stor'd with friends.
  pembroke. up once again; put spirit in the french;
    if they miscarry, we miscarry too.
  salisbury. that misbegotten devil, faulconbridge,
    in spite of spite, alone upholds the day.
  pembroke. they say king john, sore sick, hath left the field.

  melun. lead me to the revolts of england here.
  salisbury. when we were happy we had other names.
  pembroke. it is the count melun.
  salisbury. wounded to death.
  melun. fly, noble english, you are bought and sold;
    unthread the rude eye of rebellion,
    and welcome home again discarded faith.
    seek out king john, and fall before his feet;
    for if the french be lords of this loud day,

    dear amity and everlasting love.
  salisbury. may this be possible? may this be true?
  melun. have i not hideous death within my view,
    retaining but a quantity of life,
    which bleeds away even as a form of wax
    resolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire?
    what in the world should make me now deceive,
    since i must lose the use of all deceit?
    why should i then be false, since it is true
    that i must die here, and live hence by truth?

    right in thine eye. away, my friends! new flight,

  lewis. the sun of heaven, methought, was loath to set,
    but stay'd and made the western welkin blush,
    when english measure backward their own ground
    in faint retire. o, bravely came we off,

  messenger. where is my prince, the dauphin?
  lewis. here; what news?
  messenger. the count melun is slain; the english lords
    by his persuasion are again fall'n off,
    and your supply, which you have wish'd so long,
    are cast away and sunk on goodwin sands.
  lewis. ah, foul shrewd news! beshrew thy very heart!
    i did not think to be so sad to-night
    as this hath made me. who was he that said
    king john did fly an hour or two before
    the stumbling night did part our weary pow'rs?
  messenger. whoever spoke it, it is true, my lord.
  lewis. keep good quarter an
