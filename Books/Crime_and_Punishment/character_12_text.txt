e hay market. raskolnikov particularly liked this place and the neighbouring alleys, when he wandered aimlessly in the streets. here his rags did not attract contemptuous attention, and one could walk about in any attire without scandalising people. at the corner of an alley a huckster and his wife had two tables set out with tapes, thread, cotton handkerchiefs, etc. they, too, had got up to go home, but were lingering in conversation with a friend, who had just come up to them. this friend was lizaveta ivanovna, or, as everyone called her, lizaveta, the younger sister of the old pawnbroker, alyona ivanovna, whom raskolnikov had visited the previous day to pawn his watch and make his experiment.... he already knew all about lizaveta and she knew him a little too. she was a single woman of about thirty-five, tall, clumsy, timid, submissive and almost idiotic. she was a complete slave and went in fear and trembling of her sister, who made her work day and night, and even beat her. she was standing with a

 bundle before the huckster and his wife, listening earnestly and doubtfully. they were talking of something with special warmth. the moment raskolnikov caught sight of her, he was overcome by a strange sensation as it were of intense astonishment, though there was nothing astonishing about this meeting.
“you could make up your mind for yourself, lizaveta ivanovna,” the huckster was saying aloud. “come round to-morrow about seven. they will be here too.”
“to-morrow?” said lizaveta slowly and thoughtfully, as though unable to make up her mind.
“upon my word, what a fright you are in of alyona ivanovna,” gabbled the huckster’s wife, a lively little woman. “i look at you, you are like some little babe. and she is not your own sister either—nothing but a step-sister and what a hand she keeps over you!”
“but this time don’t say a wor

s fastening, and in blank terror expected every minute that the fastening would be pulled out. it certainly did seem possible, so violently was he shaking it. he was tempted to hold the fastening, but he might be aware of it. a giddiness came over him again. “i shall fall down!” flashed through his mind, but the unknown began to speak and he recovered himself at once.
“what’s up? are they asleep or murdered? d-damn them!” he bawled in a thick voice, “hey, alyona ivanovna, old witch! lizaveta ivanovna, hey, my beauty! open the door! oh, damn them! are they asleep or what?”
and again, enraged, he tugged with all his might a dozen times at the bell. he must certainly be a man of authority and an intimate acquaintance.
at this moment light hurried steps were heard not far off, on the stairs. someone else was approaching. raskolnikov had not heard them at first.
“you don’t say there’s no one at home,” the new-comer cried in a cheerful, ringing voice, addressing the first visitor, who s

 peasant, nikolay dementyev, from a child; he comes from the same province and district of zaraïsk, we are both ryazan men. and though nikolay is not a drunkard, he drinks, and i knew he had a job in that house, painting work with dmitri, who comes from the same village, too. as soon as he got the rouble he changed it, had a couple of glasses, took his change and went out. but i did not see dmitri with him then. and the next day i heard that someone had murdered alyona ivanovna and her sister, lizaveta ivanovna, with an axe. i knew them, and i felt suspicious about the ear-rings at once, for i knew the murdered woman lent money on pledges. i went to the house, and began to make careful inquiries without saying a word to anyone. first of all i asked, “is nikolay here?” dmitri told me that nikolay had gone off on the spree; he had come home at daybreak drunk, stayed in the house about ten minutes, and went out again. dmitri didn’t see him again and is finishing the job alone. and their job is on t

eaking fairly loudly.
for ten seconds there was silence as though all had been struck dumb; even the warder stepped back, mechanically retreated to the door, and stood immovable.
“what is it?” cried porfiry petrovitch, recovering from his momentary stupefaction.
“i... am the murderer,” repeated nikolay, after a brief pause.
“what... you... what... whom did you kill?” porfiry petrovitch was obviously bewildered.
nikolay again was silent for a moment.
“alyona ivanovna and her sister lizaveta ivanovna, i... killed... with an axe. darkness came over me,” he added suddenly, and was again silent.
he still remained on his knees. porfiry petrovitch stood for some moments as though meditating, but suddenly roused himself and waved back the uninvited spectators. they instantly vanished and closed the door. then he looked towards raskolnikov, who was standing in the corner, staring wildly at nikolay and moved towards him, but stopped short, looked from nikolay to raskolnikov and then again at niko
