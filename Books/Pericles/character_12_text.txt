leon's wife, with envy rare,
a present murderer does prepare
for good marina, that her daughter
might stand peerless by this slaughter.
the sooner her vile thoughts to stead,
lychorida, our nurse, is dead:
and cursed dionyza hath
the pregnant instrument of wrath
prest for this blow. the unborn event
i do commend to your content:
only i carry winged time
post on the lame feet of my rhyme;
which never could i so convey,
unless your thoughts went on my way.
dionyza does appear,
with leonine, a murderer.

dionyza.
thy  oath  remember;  thou hast sworn to do 't:
'tis but a blow, which never shall be known.
thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon,
to yield thee so much profit.  let not conscience,
which is but cold, inflaming love i' thy bosom,
inflame too nicely; nor let pity, which
even women have cast off, melt thee, but be
a soldier to thy purpose.

leonine.
i am resolved.

[enter marina, with a basket of flowers.]

marina.
no, i will rob tellus of her weed
to strew thy green with flowers: the yellows, blues,
the purple violets, and marigolds,
shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,
while summer-days do last.  ay me! poor maid,
born in a tempest, when my mother died,
this world to me is like a lasting storm,
whirring me from my friends.

dionyza.
how now, marina! why do you keep alone?
how chance my daughter is not with you? do not

and it pierces and sharpens the stomach.

leonine, take her by the arm, walk with her.

marina.
no, i pray you;
i'll not bereave you of your servant.

dionyza.
come, come;
i love the king your father, and yourself,
with more than foreign heart. we every day
expect him here: when he shall come and find
our paragon to all reports thus blasted,
he will repent the breadth of his great voyage;
blame both my lord and me, that we have taken
no care to your best courses. go, i pray you,

leonine.
when was this?

marina.
when i was born:
never was waves nor wind more violent;
and from the ladder-tackle washes off
a canvas-climber. 'ha!' says one, wilt out?'
and with a dropping industry they skip
from stem to stern: the boatswain whistles, and
the master calls, and trebles their confusion.

leonine.
come, say your prayers.

marina.
what mean you?

leonine.
if you require a little space for prayer,
i grant it: pray; but be not tedious,
for the gods are quick of ear, and i am sworn
to do my work with haste.

marina.
why will you kill rne?

leonine.
to satisfy my lady.

marina.
why would she have me kill'd?
now, as i can remember, by my troth,
i never did her hurt in all my life:
i never spoke bad word, nor did ill turn
to any living creature: believe me, la,
i never kill'd a mouse, nor hurt a fly:
i trod upon a worm against my w

leonine.
my commission
is not to reason of the deed, but do it.

marina.
you will not do 't for all the world, i hope.
you are well favour'd, and your looks foreshow
you have a gentle heart.  i saw you lately,
when you caught hurt in parting two that fought:
good sooth, it show'd well in you: do so now:
your lady seeks my life; come you between,
and save poor me, the weaker.

leonine.
i am sworn,
and will dispatch.

these roguing thieves serve the great pirate valdes;
and they hav seized marina. let her go:
thre's no hope she will return. i'll swear she's dead
and thrown into the sea. but i'll see further:
perhaps they will but please themselves upon her,
not carry her aboard.  if she remain,
whom they have ravish'd must by me be slain.

why, are you foolish?  can it be undone?

nor none can know, leonine being gone.
she did distain my child, and stood between
her and her fortunes: none would look on her,
but cast their gazes on marina's face;
whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin

and though you call my course unnatural,
you not your child well loving, yet i find
it greets me as an enterprise of kindness
perform'd to your sole daughter.
