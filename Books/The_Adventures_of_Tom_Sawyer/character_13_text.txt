e most august creation these children
had ever looked upon--and they wondered what kind of material he was made
of--and they half wanted to hear him roar, and were half afraid he might,
too. he was from constantinople, twelve miles away--so he had travelled,
and seen the world--these very eyes had looked upon the county
court-house--which was said to have a tin roof. the awe which these
reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the
ranks of staring eyes. this was the great judge thatcher, brother of
their own lawyer. jeff thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar
with the great man and be envied by the school. it would have been music
to his soul to hear the whisperings:

�look at him, jim! he�s a going up there. say--look! he�s a going to
shake hands with him--he _is_ shaking hands with him! by jings, don�t you
wish you was jeff?�

mr. walters fell to �showing off,� with all sorts of official bustlings
and activities, giving orders, delivering judgments,

chapter xxix

the first thing tom heard on friday morning was a glad piece of
news--judge thatcher�s family had come back to town the night before.
both injun joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a
moment, and becky took the chief place in the boy�s interest. he saw her
and they had an exhausting good time playing �hispy� and �gully-keeper�
 with a crowd of their schoolmates. the day was completed and crowned in
a peculiarly satisfactory way: becky teased her mother to appoint
the next day for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she
consented. the ch

 out before sunset, and straightway
the young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation
and pleasurable anticipation. tom�s excitement enabled him to keep
awake until a pretty late hour, and he had good hopes of hearing huck�s
�maow,� and of having his treasure to astonish becky and the picnickers
with, next day; but he was disappointed. no signal came that night.

morning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o�clock a giddy and
rollicking company were gathered at judge thatcher�s, and everything was
ready for a start. it was not the custom for elderly people to mar the
picnics with their presence. the children were considered safe enough
under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young
gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. the old steam ferry-boat was
chartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the main
street laden with provision-baskets. sid was sick and had to miss
the fun; mary remained at home to entertain him. the last th

waking you up and scaring you to death? my three negro men stood guard
at your house all the rest of the night. they�ve just come back.�

more visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for a couple
of hours more.

there was no sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but everybody
was early at church. the stirring event was well canvassed. news came
that not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered. when the
sermon was finished, judge thatcher�s wife dropped alongside of mrs.
harper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said:

�is my becky going to sleep all day? i just expected she would be tired
to death.�

�your becky?�

�yes,� with a startled look--�didn�t she stay with you last night?�

�why, no.�

mrs. thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as aunt polly,
talking briskly with a friend, passed by. aunt polly said:

�goodmorning, mrs. thatcher. goodmorning, mrs. harper. i�ve got a boy

was half
an hour old, two hundred men were pouring down highroad and river toward
the cave.

all the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead. many women
visited aunt polly and mrs. thatcher and tried to comfort them. they
cried with them, too, and that was still better than words. all the
tedious night the town waited for news; but when the morning dawned at
last, all the word that came was, �send more candles--and send food.�
 mrs. thatcher was almost crazed; and aunt polly, also. judge thatcher
sent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave, but they conveyed
no real cheer.

the old welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with
candle-grease, smeared with clay, and almost worn out. he found huck
still in the bed that had been provided for him, and delirious with
fever. the physicians were all at the cave, so the widow douglas came
and took charge of the patient. she said she would do her best by him,
because, whether he was good, bad, or indifferent, he was the lord�s,

 tin pans and horns were added to the din, the population massed itself
and moved toward the river, met the children coming in an open carriage
drawn by shouting citizens, thronged around it, joined its homeward
march, and swept magnificently up the main street roaring huzzah after
huzzah!

the village was illuminated; nobody went to bed again; it was the
greatest night the little town had ever seen. during the first half-hour
a procession of villagers filed through judge thatcher�s house, seized
the saved ones and kissed them, squeezed mrs. thatcher�s hand, tried to
speak but couldn�t--and drifted out raining tears all over the place.

aunt polly�s happiness was complete, and mrs. thatcher�s nearly so. it
would be complete, however, as soon as the messenger dispatched with the
great news to the cave should get the word to her husband. tom lay upon
a sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the
wonderful adventure, putting in many striking

 the hole and then helped her out; how they sat there and cried
for gladness; how some men came along in a skiff and tom hailed them
and told them their situation and their famished condition; how the men
didn�t believe the wild tale at first, �because,� said they, �you are
five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in�--then took
them aboard, rowed to a house, gave them supper, made them rest till two
or three hours after dark and then brought them home.

before day-dawn, judge thatcher and the handful of searchers with him
were tracked out, in the cave, by the twine clews they had strung behind
them, and informed of the great news.

three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to
be shaken off at once, as tom and becky soon discovered. they were
bedridden all of wednesday and thursday, and seemed to grow more and
more tired and worn, all the time. tom got about, a little, on thursday,
was downtown friday, and nearly as whole as ever saturday; but becky

s white as a sheet.

�what�s the matter, boy! here, run, somebody! fetch a glass of water!�

the water was brought and thrown into tom�s face.

�ah, now you�re all right. what was the matter with you, tom?�

�oh, judge, injun joe�s in the cave!�




chapter xxxiii

within a few minutes the news had spread, and a dozen skiff-loads of
men were on their way to mcdougal�s cave, and the ferryboat, well filled
with passengers, soon followed. tom sawyer was in the skiff that bore
judge thatcher.

when the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in
the dim twilight of the place. injun joe lay stretched upon the ground,
dead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing
eyes had been fixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer
of the free world outside. tom was touched, for he knew by his own
experience how this wretch had suffered. his pity was moved, but
nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security, now,

he widow douglas put huck�s money out at six per cent., and judge
thatcher did the same with tom�s at aunt polly�s request. each lad had
an income, now, that was simply prodigious--a dollar for every weekday in
the year and half of the sundays. it was just what the minister got--no,
it was what he was promised--he generally couldn�t collect it. a dollar
and a quarter a week would board, lodge, and school a boy in those old
simple days--and clothe him and wash him, too, for that matter.

judge thatcher had conceived a great opinion of tom. he said that no
commonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave. when
becky told her father, in strict confidence, how tom had taken her
whipping at school, the judge was visibly moved; and when she pleaded
grace for the mighty lie which tom had told in order to shift that
whipping from her shoulders to his own, the judge said with a fine
outburst that it was a noble, a generous, a magnanimous lie--a lie that
was worthy to hold up its head

and march down through history breast to
breast with george washington�s lauded truth about the hatchet! becky
thought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when he
walked the floor and stamped his foot and said that. she went straight
off and told tom about it.

judge thatcher hoped to see tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some
day. he said he meant to look to it that tom should be admitted to the
national military academy and afterward trained in the best law school
in the country, in order that he might be ready for either career or
both.

huck finn�s wealth and the fact that he was now under the widow douglas�
protection introduced him into society--no, dragged him into it, hurled
him into it--and his sufferings were almost more than he could bear. the
