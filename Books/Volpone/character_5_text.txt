     volt: mosca!--

     mos: when will you have your inventory brought, sir?
     or see a coppy of the will?--anon!--
     i will bring them to you, sir. away, be gone,
     put business in your face.

     [exit voltore.]

     volp [springing up.]: excellent mosca!
     come hither, let me kiss thee.

     mos: keep you still, sir.
     here is corbaccio.

     volp: set the plate away:
     the vulture's gone, and the old raven's come!

     mos: betake you to your silence, and your sleep:
     stand there and multiply.

     now, shall we see
     a wretch who is indeed more impotent

     you're very welcome, sir.

     mos: best shew it, sir;
     put it into his hand; 'tis only there
     he apprehends: he has his feeling, yet.
     see how he grasps it!

     corv: 'las, good gentleman!
     how pitiful the sight is!

     mos: tut! forget, sir.
     the weeping of an heir should still be laughter
     under a visor.

     corv: why, am i his heir?

     mos: sir, i am sworn, i may not shew the will,
     till he be dead; but, here has been corbaccio,
     here has been voltore, here were others too,
     i cannot number 'em, they were so many;
     all gaping here for legacies: but i,
     taking the vantage of his naming you,
     "signior corvino, signior corvino," took
     paper, and pen, and ink, and there i asked him,
     whom he would have his heir? "corvino." who
     should be executor? "corvino." and,
     to any question he was silent too,
     i still interpreted the nods he made,
     through weakness, for consent: and sent h

     my mosca, welcome!
     i guess your news.

     mos: i fear you cannot, sir.

     corv: is't not his death?

     mos: rather the contrary.

     corv: not his recovery?

     mos: yes, sir,

     corv: i am curs'd,
     i am bewitch'd, my crosses meet to vex me.
     how? how? how? how?

     mos: why, sir, with scoto's oil;
     corbaccio and voltore brought of it,
     whilst i was busy in an inner room--

     corv: death! that damn'd mountebank; but for the law
     now, i could kill the rascal: it cannot be,
     his oil should have that virtue. have not i
     known him a common rogue, come fidling in
     to the osteria, with a tumbling whore,
     and, when he has done all his forced tricks, been glad
     of a poor spoonful of dead wine, with flies in't?

     you are happily met.

     bon: that cannot be by thee.

     mos: why, sir?

     bon: nay, pray thee know thy way, and leave me:

     lady p: which way

     lady p: i pray you lend me your dwarf.

     your hopes, sir, are like happy blossoms, fair,

     alas, 'twas labor'd all, sir, for your good;
     nor was there want of counsel in the plot:
     but fortune can, at any time, o'erthrow
     the projects of a hundred learned clerks, sir.

     art banish'd from their fellowship, and our state.
     corbaccio!--bring him near--we here possess
     thy son of all thy state, and confine thee
     to the monastery of san spirito;
     where, since thou knewest not how to live well here,
     thou shalt be learn'd to die well.

     corb: ah! what said he?

     and: you shall know anon, sir.

     1 avoc: thou, corvino, shalt
     be straight embark'd from thine own house, and row'd
     round about venice, through the grand canale,
     wearing a cap, with fair long asses' ears,
     instead of horns;
