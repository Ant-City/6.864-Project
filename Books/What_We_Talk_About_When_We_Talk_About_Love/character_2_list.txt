Laura - 
                Nick's wife. Laura, thirty-five, is a legal secretary. She barely speaks at all in the story other than to say that she and Nick understand love and, at the end, that she's hungry. But her gentle physical interactions with Nick--holding hands, touching knees--give a glimpse of what love means to her.
