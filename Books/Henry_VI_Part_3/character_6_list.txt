Margaret - 
      Henry's French wife, Margaret was wooed in I Henry VI by Suffolk, who later became her lover. Alarmed that her husband is such a weak man, Margaret begins taking over for him. She scolds him for having given in to York's pressure in agreeing to pass the throne to York after his death. Then, she raises an army to fight with York; later, she stabs York to death. When Edward comes to the throne, Margaret goes to France to ask for aid and returns to lead more battles. Margaret is cursed repeatedly by her enemies for being an unnatural woman, in having taken on such a masculine role to lead Henry's armies. Yet she is the strongest inspirational force among all Henry's supporters.
