siddhartha

an indian tale

by hermann hesse





first part

to romain rolland, my dear friend




the son of the brahman

in the shade of the house, in the sunshine of the riverbank near the
boats, in the shade of the sal-wood forest, in the shade of the fig tree
is where siddhartha grew up, the handsome son of the brahman, the young
falcon, together with his friend govinda, son of a brahman.  the sun
tanned his light shoulders by the banks of the river when bathing,
performing the sacred ablutions, the sacred offerings.  in the mango
grove, shade poured into his black eyes, when playing as a boy, when
his mother sang, when the sacred offerings were made, when his father,
the scholar, taught him, when the wise men talked.  for a long time,
siddhartha had been partaking in the discussions of the wise men,
practising debate with govinda, practising with govinda the

and priest, a prince among the brahmans.

bliss leapt in his mother's breast when she saw him, when she saw him
walking, when she saw him sit down and get up, siddhartha, strong,
handsome, he who was walking on slender legs, greeting her with perfect
respect.

love touched the hearts of the brahmans' young daughters when
siddhartha walked through the lanes of the town with the luminous
forehead, with the eye of a king, with his slim hips.

but more than all the others he was loved by govinda, his friend, the
son of a brahman.  he loved siddhartha's eye and sweet voice, he loved
his walk and the perfect decency of his movements, he loved everything
siddhartha did and said and what he loved most was his spirit, his
transcendent, fiery thoughts, his ardent will, his high calling.
govinda knew: he would not become a common brahman, not a lazy official
in charge of offerings; not a greedy merchant with magic spells; not a
vain, vacuous speaker; not a mean, deceitful priest; and also not

decent, stupid sheep in the herd of the many.  no, and he, govinda, as
well did not want to become one of those, not one of those tens of
thousands of brahmans.  he wanted to follow siddhartha, the beloved,
the splendid.  and in days to come, when siddhartha would become a god,
when he would join the glorious, then govinda wanted to follow him as
his friend, his companion, his servant, his spear-carrier, his shadow.

siddhartha was thus loved by everyone.  he was a source of joy for
everybody, he was a delight for them all.

but he, siddhartha, was not a source of joy for himself, he found no
delight in himself.  walking the rosy paths of the fig tree garden,
sitting in the bluish shade of the grove of contemplation, washing his
limbs daily in the bath of repentance, sacrificing in the dim shade of
the mango fore

into his mind, flowing from the water of the river, sparkling from
the stars of the night, melting from the beams of the sun, dreams came
to him and a restlessness of the soul, fuming from the sacrifices,
breathing forth from the verses of the rig-veda, being infused into him,
drop by drop, from the teachings of the old brahmans.

siddhartha had started to nurse discontent in himself, he had started
to feel that the love of his father and the love of his mother, and also
the love of his friend, govinda, would not bring him joy for ever and
ever, would not nurse him, feed him, satisfy him.  he had started to
suspect that his venerable father and his other teachers, that the wise
brahmans had already revealed to him the most and best of their wisdom,
that they had already filled his expecting vessel with their richness,
and the vessel was not full, the spirit was not content, the soul was
not calm, the heart was not satisfied.  the ablutions were good, but
they were water, they did not wash off

ya-upanishad the words:
"truly, the name of the brahman is satyam--verily, he who knows such a
thing, will enter the heavenly world every day."  often, it seemed near,
the heavenly world, but never he had reached it completely, never he had
quenched the ultimate thirst.  and among all the wise and wisest men, he
knew and whose instructions he had received, among all of them there was
no one, who had reached it completely, the heavenly world, who had
quenched it completely, the eternal thirst.

"govinda," siddhartha spoke to his friend, "govinda, my dear, come with
me under the banyan tree, let's practise meditation."

they went to the banyan tree, they sat down, siddhartha right here,
govinda twenty paces away.  while putting himself down, ready to speak
the om, siddhartha repeated murmuring the verse:

om is the bow, the arrow is soul,
the brahman is the arrow's target,
that one should incessantly hit.

after the usual time of the exercise in meditation had passed, govinda
rose.  the evening

hman as an arrow.

once, samanas had travelled through siddhartha's town, ascetics on a
pilgrimage, three skinny, withered men, neither old nor young, with
dusty and bloody shoulders, almost naked, scorched by the sun,
surrounded by loneliness, strangers and enemies to the world, strangers
and lank jackals in the realm of humans.  behind them blew a hot scent
of quiet passion, of destructive service, of merciless self-denial.

in the evening, after the hour of contemplation, siddhartha spoke to
govinda:  "early tomorrow morning, my friend, siddhartha will go to the
samanas.  he will become a samana."

govinda turned pale, when he heard these words and read the decision in
the motionless face of his friend, unstoppable like the arrow shot from
the bow.  soon and with the first glance, govinda realized:  now it is
beginning, now siddhartha is taking his own way, now his fate is
beginning to sprout, and with his, my own.  and he turned pale like a
dry banana-skin.

"o siddhartha," he exclaimed,

"will your father permit you to do that?"

siddhartha looked over as if he was just waking up.  arrow-fast he read
in govinda's soul, read the fear, read the submission.

"o govinda," he spoke quietly, "let's not waste words.  tomorrow, at
daybreak i will begin the life of the samanas.  speak no more of it."

siddhartha entered the chamber, where his father was sitting on a mat of
bast, and stepped behind his father and remained standing there, until
his father felt that someone was standing behind him.  quoth the
brahman:  "is that you, siddhartha?  then say what you came to say."

quoth siddhartha: "with your permission, my father.  i came to tell you
that it is my longi

l her where you are going to.  but for me it is time to go to
the river and to perform the first ablution."

he took his hand from the shoulder of his son and went outside.
siddhartha wavered to the side, as he tried to walk.  he put his limbs
back under control, bowed to his father, and went to his mother to do as
his father had said.

as he slowly left on stiff legs in the first light of day the still
quiet town, a shadow rose near the last hut, who had crouched there,
and joined the pilgrim--govinda.

"you have come," said siddhartha and smiled.

"i have come," said govinda.




with the samanas

in the evening of this day they caught up with the ascetics, the skinny
samanas, and offered them their companionship and--obedience.  they
were accepted.

siddhartha gave his garments to a poor brahman in the street.  he wore
nothing more than the loincloth and the earth-coloured, unsown cloak.
he ate only once a day, and never something cooked.  he fasted for
fifteen days.  he fasted for twenty-

on-self.  but though the
ways led away from the self, their end nevertheless always led back to
the self.  though siddhartha fled from the self a thousand times, stayed
in nothingness, stayed in the animal, in the stone, the return was
inevitable, inescapable was the hour, when he found himself back in the
sunshine or in the moonlight, in the shade or in the rain, and was once
again his self and siddhartha, and again felt the agony of the cycle which
had been forced upon him.

by his side lived govinda, his shadow, walked the same paths, undertook
the same efforts.  they rarely spoke to one another, than the service
and the exercises required.  occasionally the two of them went through
the villages, to beg for food for themselves and their teachers.

"how do you think, govinda," siddhartha spoke one day while begging
this way, "how do you think did we progress?  did we reach any goals?"

govinda answered:  "we have learned, and we'll continue learning.
you'll be a great samana, siddhartha.  q

uickly, you've learned every
exercise, often the old samanas have admired you.  one day, you'll be
a holy man, oh siddhartha."

quoth siddhartha:  "i can't help but feel that it is not like this, my
friend.  what i've learned, being among the samanas, up to this day,
this, oh govinda, i could have learned more quickly and by simpler
means.  in every tavern of that part of a town where the whorehouses
are, my friend, among carters and gamblers i could have learned it."

quoth govinda:  "siddhartha is putting me on.  how could you have
learned meditation, holding your breath, insensitivity against hunger
and pain there among these wretched people?"

and siddhartha said quietly, as if he was talking to himself:  "what is
meditation?  what is leaving one's body?  what is fasting?  what is
holding one's breath?  it is fleeing from the self, it is a short
escape of the agony of being a self, it is a short numbing of the
senses against the pain and the pointlessness of life.  the

 same escape,
the same short numbing is what the driver of an ox-cart finds in the
inn, drinking a few bowls of rice-wine or fermented coconut-milk.  then
he won't feel his self any more, then he won't feel the pains of life
any more, then he finds a short numbing of the senses.  when he falls
asleep over his bowl of rice-wine, he'll find the same what siddhartha
and govinda find when they escape their bodies through long exercises,
staying in the non-self.  this is how it is, oh govinda."

quoth govinda:  "you say so, oh friend, and yet you know that siddhartha
is no driver of an ox-cart and a samana is no drunkard.  it's true that
a drinker numbs his senses, it's true that he briefly escapes and rests,
but he'll return from the delusion, finds everything to be unchanged, has
not become wiser, has gathered no enlightenment,--has not risen several
steps."

and siddhartha spoke with a smile:  "i do not know, i've never been a
drunkard.  but that i, siddhartha, find only a short

numbing of the
senses in my exercises and meditations and that i am just as far removed
from wisdom, from salvation, as a child in the mother's womb, this i
know, oh govinda, this i know."

and once again, another time, when siddhartha left the forest together
with govinda, to beg for some food in the village for their brothers and
teachers, siddhartha began to speak and said:  "what now, oh govinda,
might we be on the right path?  might we get closer to enlightenment?
might we get closer to salvation?  or do we perhaps live in a circle--
we, who have thought we were escaping the cycle?"

quoth govinda:  "we have learned a lot, siddhartha, there is still
much to learn.  we are not going around in circles, we are moving up,
the circle is a spiral, we have already ascended many a level."

siddhartha answered:  "how old, would you think, is our oldest samana,
our venerable teacher?"

quoth go

vinda:  "our oldest one might be about sixty years of age."

and siddhartha:  "he has lived for sixty years and has not reached the
nirvana.  he'll turn seventy and eighty, and you and me, we will grow
just as old and will do our exercises, and will fast, and will meditate.
but we will not reach the nirvana, he won't and we won't.  oh govinda,
i believe out of all the samanas out there, perhaps not a single one,
not a single one, will reach the nirvana.  we find comfort, we find
numbness, we learn feats, to deceive others.  but the most important
thing, the path of paths, we will not find."

"if you only," spoke govinda, "wouldn't speak such terrible words,
siddhartha!  how could it be that among so many learned men, among so
many brahmans, among so many austere and venerable samanas, among so
many who are searching, so many who are

 eagerly trying, so many holy
men, no one will find the path of paths?"

but siddhartha said in a voice which contained just as much sadness as
mockery, with a quiet, a slightly sad, a slightly mocking voice:  "soon,
govinda, your friend will leave the path of the samanas, he has walked
along your side for so long.  i'm suffering of thirst, oh govinda, and
on this long path of a samana, my thirst has remained as strong as ever.
i always thirsted for knowledge, i have always been full of questions.
i have asked the brahmans, year after year, and i have asked the holy
vedas, year after year, and i have asked the devote samanas, year after
year.  perhaps, oh govinda, it had been just as well, had been just as
smart and just as profitable, if i had asked the hornbill-bird or the
chimpanzee.  it took me a long time and am not finished learning th

is
yet, oh govinda: that there is nothing to be learned!  there is indeed
no such thing, so i believe, as what we refer to as `learning'.  there
is, oh my friend, just one knowledge, this is everywhere, this is atman,
this is within me and within you and within every creature.  and so i'm
starting to believe that this knowledge has no worser enemy than the
desire to know it, than learning."

at this, govinda stopped on the path, rose his hands, and spoke:  "if
you, siddhartha, only would not bother your friend with this kind of
talk!  truly, you words stir up fear in my heart.  and just consider:
what would become of the sanctity of prayer, what of the venerability of
the brahmans' caste, what of the holiness of the samanas, if it was as
you say, if there was no learning?!  what, oh siddhartha, what would
then become of all of this what is holy, what is precious, what is
venerable on earth?!"

and

govinda mumbled a verse to himself, a verse from an upanishad:

he who ponderingly, of a purified spirit, loses himself in the
meditation of atman, unexpressable by words is his blissfulness of his
heart.

but siddhartha remained silent.  he thought about the words which
govinda had said to him and thought the words through to their end.

yes, he thought, standing there with his head low, what would remain of
all that which seemed to us to be holy?  what remains?  what can stand
the test?  and he shook his head.

at one time, when the two young men had lived among the samanas for
about three years and had shared their exercises, some news, a rumour, a
myth reached them after being retold many times:  a man had appeared,
gotama by name, the exalted one, the buddha, he h
 
 ___________________________
 
old, here a source seemed to spring forth, here a messenger seemed
to call out, comforting, mild, full of noble promises.  everywhere
where the rumour of buddha was heard, everywhere in the lands of india,
the young men listened up, felt a longing, felt hope, and among the
brahmans' sons of the towns and villages every pilgrim and stranger was
welcome, when he brought news of him, the exalted one, the sakyamuni.

the myth had also reached the samanas in the forest, and also
siddhartha, and also govinda, slowly, drop by drop, every drop laden
with hope, every drop laden with doubt.  they rarely talked about it,
because the oldest one of the samanas did not like this myth.  he had
heard that this alleged buddha used to be an ascetic before and had
lived in the forest, but had then turned back to luxury and worldly
pleasures, and he had no high opinion of this gotama.

"oh siddhartha," govinda spoke one day to his friend.  "today, i was
in the village, and a brahman invited me into his house, an

d in his
house, there was the son of a brahman from magadha, who has seen the
buddha with his own eyes and has heard him teach.  verily, this made
my chest ache when i breathed, and thought to myself:  if only i would
too, if only we both would too, siddhartha and me, live to see the
hour when we will hear the teachings from the mouth of this perfected
man!  speak, friend, wouldn't we want to go there too and listen to the
teachings from the buddha's mouth?"

quoth siddhartha:  "always, oh govinda, i had thought, govinda would
stay with the samanas, always i had believed his goal was to live to be
sixty and seventy years of age and to keep on practising those feats and
exercises, which are becoming a samana.  but behold, i had not known
govinda well enough, i knew little of his heart.  so now you, my
faithful friend, want to take a new path and go there, where the buddha
spreads his teachings."

quoth govinda:  "you're mocking me.  mock me if you like, siddhartha!
but have you not also d
 
 ___________________________
 
eveloped a desire, an eagerness, to hear these
teachings?  and have you not at one time said to me, you would not walk
the path of the samanas for much longer?"

at this, siddhartha laughed in his very own manner, in which his voice
assumed a touch of sadness and a touch of mockery, and said:  "well,
govinda, you've spoken well, you've remembered correctly.  if you
only remembered the other thing as well, you've heard from me, which is
that i have grown distrustful and tired against teachings and learning,
and that my faith in words, which are brought to us by teachers, is
small.  but let's do it, my dear, i am willing to listen to these
teachings--though in my heart i believe that we've already tasted the
best fruit of these teachings."

quoth govinda:  "your willingness delights my heart.  but te
 
 ___________________________
 
ll me, how
should this be possible?  how should the gotama's teachings, even before
we have heard them, have already revealed their best fruit to us?"

quoth siddhartha:  "let us eat this fruit and wait for the rest, oh
govinda!  but this fruit, which we already now received thanks to the
gotama, consisted in him calling us away from the samanas!  whether he
has also other and better things to give us, oh friend, let us await
with calm hearts."

on this very same day, siddhartha informed the oldest one of the samanas
of his decision, that he wanted to leave him.  he informed the oldest
one with all the courtesy and modesty becoming to a younger one and a
student.  but the samana became angry, because the two young men
 
 ___________________________
 
 wanted
to leave him, and talked loudly and used crude swearwords.

govinda was startled and became embarrassed.  but siddhartha put his
mouth close to govinda's ear and whispered to him:  "now, i want to show
the old man that i've learned something from him."

positioning himself closely in front of the samana, with a concentrated
soul, he captured the old man's glance with his glances, deprived him of
his power, made him mute, took away his free will, subdued him under his
own will, commanded him, to do silently, whatever he demanded him to do.
the old man became mute, his eyes became motionless, his will was
paralysed, his arms were hanging down; w

ithout power, he had fallen
victim to siddhartha's spell.  but siddhartha's thoughts brought the
samana under their control, he had to carry out, what they commanded.
and thus, the old man made several bows, performed gestures of blessing,
spoke stammeringly a godly wish for a good journey.  and the young men
returned the bows with thanks, returned the wish, went on their way with
salutations.

on the way, govinda said:  "oh siddhartha, you have learned more from
the samanas than i knew.  it is hard, it is very hard to cast a spell
on an old samana.  truly, if you had stayed there, you would soon have
learned to walk on water."

"i do not seek to walk on water," said siddhartha.  "let old samanas be
content with such feats!"




gotama

in the town of savathi, every child knew the name of the exalted buddha,
and every house was prepared to fill the alms-dish of gotama's
disciples, the silently begging on

, the
most venerable one, for we are two samanas from the forest and have
come, to see him, the perfected one, and to hear the teachings from his
mouth."

quoth the woman:  "here, you have truly come to the right place, you
samanas from the forest.  you should know, in jetavana, in the garden
of anathapindika is where the exalted one dwells.  there you pilgrims
shall spent the night, for there is enough space for the innumerable,
who flock here, to hear the teachings from his mouth."

this made govinda happy, and full of joy he exclaimed:  "well so, thus
we have reached our destination, and our path has come to an end!  but
tell us, oh mother of the pilgrims, do you know him, the buddha, have
you seen him with your own eyes?"

quoth the woman:  "many times i have seen him, the exalted one.  on many
days, i have seen him, walking through the alleys in silence, wearing
his yellow cloak, presenting his alms-dish in silence at the doors of
the houses, leaving with a filled dish."

delightedly, go

full of people,
bustling like bees.  the majority of the monks went out with their
alms-dish, to collect food in town for their lunch, the only meal of the
day.  the buddha himself, the enlightened one, was also in the habit of
taking this walk to beg in the morning.

siddhartha saw him, and he instantly recognised him, as if a god had
pointed him out to him.  he saw him, a simple man in a yellow robe,
bearing the alms-dish in his hand, walking silently.

"look here!" siddhartha said quietly to govinda.  "this one is the
buddha."

attentively, govinda looked at the monk in the yellow robe, who seemed
to be in no way different from the hundreds of other monks.  and soon,
govinda also realized:  this is the one.  and they followed him and
observed him.

the buddha went on his way, modestly and deep in his thoughts, his
calm face was neither happy nor sad, it seemed to smile quietly and
inwardly.  with a hidden smile, quiet, calm, somewhat resembling a
healthy child, the buddha walked, wore the

ly dangling hand expressed peace,
expressed perfection, did not search, did not imitate, breathed softly
in an unwhithering calm, in an unwhithering light, an untouchable peace.

thus gotama walked towards the town, to collect alms, and the two
samanas recognised him solely by the perfection of his calm, by the
quietness of his appearance, in which there was no searching, no desire,
no imitation, no effort to be seen, only light and peace.

"today, we'll hear the teachings from his mouth." said govinda.

siddhartha did not answer.  he felt little curiosity for the teachings,
he did not believe that they would teach him anything new, but he had,
just as govinda had, heard the contents of this buddha's teachings
again and again, though these reports only represented second- or
third-hand information.  but attentively he looked at gotama's head,
his shoulders, his feet, his quietly dangling hand, and it seemed to
him as if every joint of every finger of this hand was of these
teachings, spoke of
 
 ___________________________
 
h of the teachings, of the examples, of the repetitions,
brightly and quietly his voice hovered over the listeners, like a light,
like a starry sky.

when the buddha--night had already fallen--ended his speech, many a
pilgrim stepped forward and asked to accepted into the community, sought
refuge in the teachings.  and gotama accepted them by speaking:  "you
have heard the teachings well, it has come to you well.  thus join us
and walk in holiness, to put an end to all suffering."

behold, then govinda, the shy one, also stepped forward and spoke:  "i
also take my refuge in the exalted one and his teachings," and he asked
to accepted into the community of his disciples and was accepted.

right afterwards, when the buddha had retired for the night, govinda
turned to siddhartha and spoke eagerly:  "siddhartha, it is not my place
to scold you.  we have both heard the exalted one, we have both
perceived the teachings.  govinda has heard the teachings, he has taken
refuge in it.  but you, my honou
 
 ___________________________
 
red friend, don't you also want to walk
the path of salvation?  would you want to hesitate, do you want to wait
any longer?"

siddhartha awakened as if he had been asleep, when he heard govinda's
words.  for a long time, he looked into govinda's face.  then he spoke
quietly, in a voice without mockery:  "govinda, my friend, now you have
taken this step, now you have chosen this path.  always, oh govinda,
you've been my friend, you've always walked one step behind me.  often i
have thought:  won't govinda for once also take a step by himself,
without me, out of his own soul?  behold, now you've turned into a man
and are choosing your path for yourself.  i wish that you would go it up
to its end, oh my friend, that you shall find salvation!"

govinda, not completely understanding it yet, repeated his question in
an impatient tone:  "speak up, i beg you, my dear!  tell me, since it
could not be a
 
 ___________________________
 
ny other way, that you also, my learned friend, will take
your refuge with the exalted buddha!"

siddhartha placed his hand on govinda's shoulder:  "you failed to hear
my good wish for you, oh govinda.  i'm repeating it:  i wish that you
would go this path up to its end, that you shall find salvation!"

in this moment, govinda realized that his friend had left him, and he
started to weep.

"siddhartha!" he exclaimed lamentingly.

siddhartha kindly spoke to him:  "don't forget, govinda, that you are
now one of the samanas of the buddha!  you have renounced your home
and your parents, renounced your birth and possessions, renounced your
free will, renounced all friendship.  this is what the teachings
require, this is what the exalted one wants.  this is what you wanted
for yourself.  tomorrow, oh govinda, i'll leave you."

for a long time, the friends continued walking in the grove; for a long
time, they lay there and found no sleep.  and over and over again,
govinda urged his

 friend, he should tell him why he would not want to
seek refuge in gotama's teachings, what fault he would find in these
teachings.  but siddhartha turned him away every time and said:  "be
content, govinda!  very good are the teachings of the exalted one, how
could i find a fault in them?"

very early in the morning, a follower of buddha, one of his oldest
monks, went through the garden and called all those to him who had as
novices taken their refuge in the teachings, to dress them up in the
yellow robe and to instruct them in the first teachings and duties of
their position.  then govinda broke loose, embraced once again his
childhood friend and left with the novices.

but siddhartha walked thr

not before any other.  no teachings will entice me any more, since this
man's teachings have not enticed me.

i am deprived by the buddha, thought siddhartha, i am deprived, and
even more he has given to me.  he has deprived me of my friend, the one
who had believed in me and now believes in him, who had been my shadow
and is now gotama's shadow.  but he has given me siddhartha, myself.




awakening

when siddhartha left the grove, where the buddha, the perfected one,
stayed behind, where govinda stayed behind, then he felt that in this
grove his past life also stayed behind and parted from him.  he pondered
about this sensation, which filled him completely, as he was slowly
walking along.  he pondered deeply, like diving into a deep water he
let himself sink down to the ground of the sensation, down to the place
where the causes lie, because to identify the causes, so it seemed to
him, is the very essence of thinking, and by this alone sensations turn
into realizations and are not lost

was.  there was no nobleman who did not
belong to the noblemen, no worker that did not belong to the workers,
and found refuge with them, shared their life, spoke their language.
no brahman, who would not be regarded as brahmans and lived with them,
no ascetic who would not find his refuge in the caste of the samanas,
and even the most forlorn hermit in the forest was not just one and
alone, he was also surrounded by a place he belonged to, he also
belonged to a caste, in which he was at home.  govinda had become a
monk, and a thousand monks were his brothers, wore the same robe as he,
believed in his faith, spoke his language.  but he, siddhartha, where
did he belong to?  with whom would he share his life?  whose language
would he speak?

out of this moment, when the world melted away all around him, when he
stood alone like a star in the sky, out of this moment of a cold and
despair, siddhartha emerged, more a self than before, more firmly
concentrated.  he felt:  this had been the last tre

the scent of strength and passion came
forcefully out of the hasty eddies of the water, which the pike stirred
up, impetuously hunting.

all of this had always existed, and he had not seen it; he had not been
with it.  now he was with it, he was part of it.  light and shadow
ran through his eyes, stars and moon ran through his heart.

on the way, siddhartha also remembered everything he had experienced in
the garden jetavana, the teaching he had heard there, the divine buddha,
the farewell from govinda, the conversation with the exalted one.  again
he remembered his own words, he had spoken to the exalted one, every
word, and with astonishment he became aware of the fact that there he
had said things which he had not really known yet at this time.  what he
had said to gotama: his, the buddha's, treasure and secret was not the

experienced in the hour of his enlightenment--it was nothing but this

eard a voice, a voice in his own heart, which had
commanded him to seek rest under this tree, and he had neither preferred
self-castigation, offerings, ablutions, nor prayer, neither food nor
drink, neither sleep nor dream, he had obeyed the voice.  to obey like
this, not to an external command, only to the voice, to be ready like
this, this was good, this was necessary, nothing else was necessary.

in the night when he slept in the straw hut of a ferryman by the river,
siddhartha had a dream:  govinda was standing in front of him, dressed
in the yellow robe of an ascetic.  sad was how govinda looked like,
sadly he asked:  why have you forsaken me?  at this, he embraced
govinda, wrapped his arms around him, and as he was pulling him close
to his chest and kissed him, it was not govinda any more, but a woman,
and a full breast popped out of the woman's dress, at which siddhartha
lay and drank, sweetly and strongly tasted the milk from this breast.
it tasted of woman and man, of sun and forest,

will give me the gift another time."

"do you think so?" asked siddhartha amusedly.

"surely.  this too, i have learned from the river: everything is coming
back!  you too, samana, will come back.  now farewell!  let your
friendship be my reward.  commemorate me, when you'll make offerings to
the gods."

smiling, they parted.  smiling, siddhartha was happy about the
friendship and the kindness of the ferryman.  "he is like govinda," he
thought with a smile, "all i meet on my path are like govinda.  all are
thankful, though they are the ones who would have a right to receive
thanks.  all are submissive, all would like to be friends, like to
obey, think little.  like children are all people."

at about noon, he came through a village.  in front of the mud cottages,
children were rolling about in the street, were playing with
pumpkin-seeds and sea-shells, screamed and wrestled, but they all
timidly fled from the unknown sam

came back to beautiful kamala, learned the art of love, practised the
cult of lust, in which more than in anything else giving and taking
becomes one, chatted with her, learned from her, gave her advice,
received advice.  she understood him better than govinda used to
understand him, she was more similar to him.

once, he said to her:  "you are like me, you are different from most
people.  you are kamala, nothing else, and inside of you, there is a
peace and refuge, to which you can go at every hour of the day and be
at home at yourself, as i can also do.  few people have this, and yet
all could have it."

"not all people are smart," said kamala.

"no," said siddhartha, "that's not the reason why.  kamaswami is just as
smart as i, and still has no re

nded by the good life, siddhartha hardly felt
them fading away.  he had become rich, for quite a while he possessed a
house of his own and his own servants, and a garden before the city by
the river.  the people liked him, they came to him, whenever they needed
money or advice, but there was nobody close to him, except kamala.

that high, bright state of being awake, which he had experienced that
one time at the height of his youth, in those days after gotama's
sermon, after the separation from govinda, that tense expectation, that
proud state of standing alone without teachings and without teachers,
that supple willingness to listen to the divine voice in his own heart,
had slowly become a memory, had been fleeting; distant and quiet, the
holy source murmured, which used to be near, which used to murmur within
himself.  nevertheless, many things he had learned from the samanas, he
had learned from gotama, he had learned from his father the brahman,
had remained within him for a long time aft

disease of the soul, which rich people have, grabbed hold of him.

like a veil, like a thin mist, tiredness came over siddhartha, slowly,
getting a bit denser every day, a bit murkier every month, a bit heavier
every year.  as a new dress becomes old in time, loses its beautiful
colour in time, gets stains, gets wrinkles, gets worn off at the seams,
and starts to show threadbare spots here and there, thus siddhartha's
new life, which he had started after his separation from govinda, had
grown old, lost colour and splendour as the years passed by, was
gathering wrinkles and stains, and hidden at bottom, already showing its
ugliness here and there, disappointment and disgust were waiting.
siddhartha did not notice it.  he only noticed that this bright and
reliable voice inside of him, which had awoken in him at that time and
had ever guided him in his best times, had become silent.

he had been captured by the world, by lust, covetousness, sloth, and
finally also by that vi

a game without an ending?  was it necessary to live for this?  no, it
was not necessary!  the name of this game was sansara, a game for
children, a game which was perhaps enjoyable to play once, twice, ten
times--but for ever and ever over again?

then, siddhartha knew that the game was over, that he could not play it
any more.  shivers ran over his body, inside of him, so he felt,
something had died.

that entire day, he sat under the mango-tree, thinking of his father,
thinking of govinda, thinking of gotama.  did he have to leave them to
become a kamaswami?  he still sat there, when the night had fallen.
when, looking up, he caught sight of the stars, he thought:  "here i'm
sitting under my mango-tree, in my pleasure-garden."  he smiled a little
--was it really necessary, was it right, was it not as foolish game,
that he owned a mango-tree, that he owned a garden?

he also put an end to this, this also died in him.  he rose, bid his
farewell to the mango-tree, his farewell to t

f in his chest, this siddhartha, the eccentric, the weird
one, but this siddhartha was nevertheless transformed, was renewed,
was strangely well rested, strangely awake, joyful and curious.

siddhartha straightened up, then he saw a person sitting opposite to him,
an unknown man, a monk in a yellow robe with a shaven head, sitting in
the position of pondering.  he observed the man, who had neither hair
on his head nor a beard, and he had not observed him for long when he
recognised this monk as govinda, the friend of his youth, govinda who
had taken his refuge with the exalted buddha.  govinda had aged, he too,
but still his face bore the same features, expressed zeal, faithfulness,
searching, timidness.  but when govinda now, sensing his gaze, opened
his eyes and looked at him, siddhartha saw that govinda did not
recognise him.  govinda was happy to find him awake; apparently, he had
been sitting here for a long time and been waiting for him to wake up,
though he did not know him.

"i have b

"you have been sleeping," answered govinda.  "it is not good to be
sleeping in such places, where snakes often are and the animals of the
forest have their paths.  i, oh sir, am a follower of the exalted
gotama, the buddha, the sakyamuni, and have been on a pilgrimage
together with several of us on this path, when i saw you lying and
sleeping in a place where it is dangerous to sleep.  therefore, i sought
to wake you up, oh sir, and since i saw that your sleep was very deep,
i stayed behind from my group and sat with you.  and then, so

i have served you, tiredness has overwhelmed me.  but now that you're
awake, let me go to catch up with my brothers."

"i thank you, samana, for watching out over my sleep," spoke siddhartha.
"you're friendly, you followers of the exalted one.  now you may go
then."

"i'm going, sir.  may you, sir, always be in good health."

"i thank you, samana."

govinda made the gesture of a salutation and said:  "farewell."

"farewell, govinda," said siddhartha.

the monk stopped.

"permit me to ask, sir, from where do you know my name?"

now, siddhartha smiled.

"i know you, oh govinda, from your father's hut, and from the school
of the brahmans, and from the offerings, and from our walk to the
samanas, and from that hour when you took your refuge with the exalted
one in the grove jetavana."

"you're siddhartha," govinda exclaimed loudly.  "now, i'm recognis

"i'm going nowhere.  we monks are always travelling, whenever it is not
the rainy season, we always move from one place to another, live
according to the rules if the teachings passed on to us, accept alms,
move on.  it is always like this.  but you, siddhartha, where are you
going to?"

quoth siddhartha:  "with me too, friend, it is as it is with you.  i'm
going nowhere.  i'm just travelling.  i'm on a pilgrimage."

govinda spoke:  "you're saying: you're on a pilgrimage, and i believe in
you.  but, forgive me, oh siddhartha, you do not look like a pilgrim.
you're wearing a rich man's garments, you're wearing the shoes of a
distinguished gentleman, and your hair, with the fragrance of perfume,
is not a pilgrim's hair, not the hair of a samana."

"right so, my dear, you have observed well, your keen eyes see
everything.  but i haven't said to you that i was a samana.  i said:
i'm on a pilgrimage.  and so it is:  i'm

 on a pilgrimage."

"you're on a pilgrimage," said govinda.  "but few would go on a
pilgrimage in such clothes, few in such shoes, few with such hair.
never i have met such a pilgrim, being a pilgrim myself for many years."

"i believe you, my dear govinda.  but now, today, you've met a pilgrim
just like this, wearing such shoes, such a garment.  remember, my dear:
not eternal is the world of appearances, not eternal, anything but
eternal are our garments and the style of our hair, and our hair and
bodies themselves.  i'm wearing a rich man's clothes, you've seen this
quite right.  i'm wearing them, because i have been a rich man, and i'm
wearing my hair like the worldly and lustful people, for i have been
one of them."

"and now, siddhartha, wha

"i don't know it, i don't know it just like you.  i'm travelling.  i was
a rich man and am no rich man any more, and what i'll be tomorrow, i
don't know."

"you've lost your riches?"

"i've lost them or they me.  they somehow happened to slip away from me.
the wheel of physical manifestations is turning quickly, govinda.  where
is siddhartha the brahman?  where is siddhartha the samana?  where is
siddhartha the rich man?  non-eternal things change quickly, govinda,
you know it."

govinda looked at the friend of his youth for a long time, with doubt in
his eyes.  after that, he gave him the salutation which one would use
on a gentleman and went on his way.

with a smiling face, siddhartha watched him leave, he loved him still,
this faithful man, this fearful man.  and how could he not have loved
everybody and everything in this moment, in the glorious hour after his
wonderful sleep, filled with om!  the enchantment, which had happened
inside of him in his

one heading for his goal, each one obsessed by the goal, each one
suffering.  the river sang with a voice of suffering, longingly it sang,
longingly, it flowed towards its goal, lamentingly its voice sang.

"do you hear?" vasudeva's mute gaze asked.  siddhartha nodded.

"listen better!" vasudeva whispered.

siddhartha made an effort to listen better.  the image of his father,
his own image, the image of his son merged, kamala's image also appeared
and was dispersed, and the image of govinda, and other images, and they
merged with each other, turned all into the river, headed all, being the
river, for the goal, longing, desiring, suffering, and the river's voice
sounded full of yearning, full of burning woe, full of unsatisfiable
desire.  for the goal, the river was heading, siddhartha saw it
hurrying, the river, which consisted of him and his loved ones and of
all people, he had ever seen, all of these waves and waters were
hurrying, suffering, towards goals, many goals, the water

's enough.  farewell, hut, farewell, river, farewell, siddhartha!"

siddhartha made a deep bow before him who bid his farewell.

"i've known it," he said quietly.  "you'll go into the forests?"

"i'm going into the forests, i'm going into the oneness," spoke vasudeva
with a bright smile.

with a bright smile, he left; siddhartha watched him leaving.  with deep
joy, with deep solemnity he watched him leave, saw his steps full of
peace, saw his head full of lustre, saw his body full of light.




govinda

together with other monks, govinda used to spend the time of rest
between pilgrimages in the pleasure-grove, which the courtesan kamala
had given to the followers of gotama for a gift.  he heard talk of an
old ferryman, who lived one day's journey away by the river, and
who was regarded as a wise man by many.  when govinda went back on his
way, he chose the path to the ferry, eager to see the ferryman.
because, though he had lived his entire life by the rules, though he was

to the river and asked the old man to ferry him over, and when
they got off the boat on the other side, he said to the old man:
"you're very good to us monks and pilgrims, you have already ferried
many of us across the river.  aren't you too, ferryman, a searcher for
the right path?"

quoth siddhartha, smiling from his old eyes:  "do you call yourself a
searcher, oh venerable one, though you are already of an old in years
and are wearing the robe of gotama's monks?"

"it's true, i'm old," spoke govinda, "but i haven't stopped searching.
never i'll stop searching, this seems to be my destiny.  you too, so it
seems to me, have been searching.  would you like to tell me something,
oh honourable one?"

quoth siddhartha:  "what should i possibly have to tell you, oh
venerable one?  perhaps that you're searching far too much?  that in all
that searching, you don't find the time for finding?"

"how come?" asked govinda.

"when someone is searching," said siddhartha, "then it might easily
happen that

for, that he is unable to find anything, to let anything enter his mind,
because he always thinks of nothing but the object of his search,
because he has a goal, because he is obsessed by the goal.  searching
means: having a goal.  but finding means: being free, being open, having
no goal.  you, oh venerable one, are perhaps indeed a searcher, because,
striving for your goal, there are many things you don't see, which are
directly in front of your eyes."

"i don't quite understand yet," asked govinda, "what do you mean by
this?"

quoth siddhartha:  "a long time ago, oh venerable one, many years ago,
you've once before been at this river and have found a sleeping man by
the river, and have sat down with him to guard his sleep.  but, oh
govinda, you did not recognise the sleeping man."

astonished, as if he had been the object of a magic spell, the monk
looked into the ferryman's eyes.

"are you siddhartha?" he asked with a timid voice.  "i wouldn't have
recognised you this time as well!  fro

m my heart, i'm greeting you,
siddhartha; from my heart, i'm happy to see you once again!  you've
changed a lot, my friend.--and so you've now become a ferryman?"

in a friendly manner, siddhartha laughed.  "a ferryman, yes.  many
people, govinda, have to change a lot, have to wear many a robe, i am
one of those, my dear.  be welcome, govinda, and spend the night in my
hut."

govinda stayed the night in the hut and slept on the bed which used to
be vasudeva's bed.  many questions he posed to the friend of his youth,
many things siddhartha had to tell him from his life.

when in the next morning the time had come to start the day's journey,
govinda said, not without hesitation, these words:  "before i'll
continue on my path, siddhartha, permit me to ask one more question.
do you have a teaching?  do you have a faith, or a knowledge, you
follow, which helps you to live and to

er, and some gamblers with dice.  once, even a
follower of buddha, travelling on foot, has been my teacher; he sat with
me when i had fallen asleep in the forest, on the pilgrimage.  i've also
learned from him, i'm also grateful to him, very grateful.  but most of
all, i have learned here from this river and from my predecessor, the
ferryman vasudeva.  he was a very simple person, vasudeva, he was no
thinker, but he knew what is necessary just as well as gotama, he was a
perfect man, a saint."

govinda said:  "still, oh siddhartha, you love a bit to mock people, as
it seems to me.  i believe in you and know that you haven't followed a
teacher.  but haven't you found something by yourself, though you've
found no teachings, you still found certain thoughts, certain insights,
which are your own and which help you to live?  if you would like to
tell me some of these, you would delight my heart."

quoth siddhartha:  "i've had thoughts, yes, and insight, again and
again.  sometimes, for an hour or

for an entire day, i have felt
knowledge in me, as one would feel life in one's heart.  there have
been many thoughts, but it would be hard for me to convey them to you.
look, my dear govinda, this is one of my thoughts, which i have found:
wisdom cannot be passed on.  wisdom which a wise man tries to pass on
to someone always sounds like foolishness."

"are you kidding?" asked govinda.

"i'm not kidding.  i'm telling you what i've found.  knowledge can be
conveyed, but not wisdom.  it can be found, it can be lived, it is
possible to be carried by it, miracles can be performed with it, but it
cannot be expressed in words and taught.  this was what i, even as a
young man, sometimes suspected, what has driven me away from the
teachers.  i have found a thought, govinda, which you'll again regard as
a joke or foolishness, but which is my best thought.  it says:  the
opposite of e

ad to divide it into sansara and nirvana, into deception
and truth, into suffering and salvation.  it cannot be done differently,
there is no other way for him who wants to teach.  but the world itself,
what exists around us and inside of us, is never one-sided.  a person or
an act is never entirely sansara or entirely nirvana, a person is never
entirely holy or entirely sinful.  it does really seem like this,
because we are subject to deception, as if time was something real.
time is not real, govinda, i have experienced this often and often
again.  and if time is not real, then the gap which seems to be between
the world and the eternity, between suffering and blissfulness, between
evil and good, is also a deception."

"how come?" asked govinda timidly.

"listen well, my dear, listen well!  the sinner, which i am and which
you are, is a sinner, but in times to come he will be brahma again, he
will reach the nirvana, will be buddha--and now see: these 'times to
come' are a deception, are onl

things.  no, within the sinner is now and today already the future
buddha, his future is already all there, you have to worship in him, in
you, in everyone the buddha which is coming into being, the possible,
the hidden buddha.  the world, my friend govinda, is not imperfect, or
on a slow path towards perfection: no, it is perfect in every moment,
all sin already carries the divine forgiveness in itself, all small
children already have the old person in themselves, all infants already
have death, all dying people the eternal life.  it is not possible for
any person to see how far another one has already progressed on his
path; in the robber and dice-gambler, the buddha is waiting; in the
brahman, the robber is waiting.  in deep meditation, there i

harm me.  i have experienced on my body and on my soul that i needed sin
very much, i needed lust, the desire for possessions, vanity, and needed
the most shameful despair, in order to learn how to give up all
resistance, in order to learn how to love the world, in order to stop
comparing it to some world i wished, i imagined, some kind of perfection
i had made up, but to leave it as it is and to love it and to enjoy
being a part of it.--these, oh govinda, are some of the thoughts which
have come into my mind."

siddhartha bent down, picked up a stone from the ground, and weighed it
in his hand.

"this here," he said playing with it, "is a stone, and will, after a
certain time, perhaps turn into soil, and will turn from soil into a
plant or animal or human being.  in the past, i would have said:  this
stone is just a stone, it is worthless, it belongs to the world of the
maja; but because it might be able to become also a human being and a

 is a stone, is oily or juicy, and this is this very fact
which i like and regard as wonderful and worthy of worship.--but let me
speak no more of this.  the words are not good for the secret meaning,
everything always becomes a bit different, as soon as it is put into
words, gets distorted a bit, a bit silly--yes, and this is also very
good, and i like it a lot, i also very much agree with this, that this
what is one man's treasure and wisdom always sounds like foolishness to
another person."

govinda listened silently.

"why have you told me this about the stone?" he asked hesitantly after
a pause.

"i did it without any specific intention.  or perhaps what i meant was,
that love this very stone, and the river, and all these things we are
looking at and from which we can learn.  i can love a stone, govinda,
and also a tree or a piece of bark.  this are things, and things can be
loved.  but i cannot love words.  therefore, teachings are no good for
me, they have no hardness, no softness, no

colours, no edges, no smell,
no taste, they have nothing but words.  perhaps it are these which keep
you from finding peace, perhaps it are the many words.  because
salvation and virtue as well, sansara and nirvana as well, are mere
words, govinda.  there is no thing which would be nirvana; there is just
the word nirvana."

quoth govinda:  "not just a word, my friend, is nirvana.  it is a
thought."

siddhartha continued:  "a thought, it might be so.  i must confess to
you, my dear: i don't differentiate much between thoughts and words.
to be honest, i also have no high opinion of thoughts.  i have a better
opinion of things.  here on this ferry-boat, for instance, a man has
been my predecessor and teacher, a holy man, who has for many years
simply believed in the river, nothing else.  he had noticed that the
river's spoke to hi

m, he learned from it, it educated and taught him,
the river seemed to be a god to him, for many years he did not know that
every wind, every cloud, every bird, every beetle was just as divine and
knows just as much and can teach just as much as the worshipped river.
but when this holy man went into the forests, he knew everything, knew
more than you and me, without teachers, without books, only because he
had believed in the river."

govinda said:  "but is that what you call `things', actually something
real, something which has existence?  isn't it just a deception of the
maja, just an image and illusion?  your stone, your tree, your river--
are they actually a reality?"

"this too," spoke siddhartha, "i do not care very much about.  let the
things be illusions or not, after all i would then also be an illusion,
and thus they are always like me.  this is what makes them so dear and
worthy of veneration for me: they are like me.  t

herefore, i can love
them.  and this is now a teaching you will laugh about: love, oh
govinda, seems to me to be the most important thing of all.  to
thoroughly understand the world, to explain it, to despise it, may be
the thing great thinkers do.  but i'm only interested in being able to
love the world, not to despise it, not to hate it and me, to be able to
look upon it and me and all beings with love and admiration and great
respect."

"this i understand," spoke govinda.  "but this very thing was discovered
by the exalted one to be a deception.  he commands benevolence,
clemency, sympathy, tolerance, but not love; he forbade us to tie our
heart in love to earthly things."

"i know it," said siddhartha; his smile shone golden.  "i know it,
govinda.  and behold, with this we are right in the middle of the
thicket of opinions, in the dispute about words.  for i cannot deny, my
words of love are in a contradiction, a seeming contradiction with
gotama's words.  for

 their transitoriness, in
their meaninglessness, and yet loved people thus much, to use a long,
laborious life only to help them, to teach them!  even with him, even
with your great teacher, i prefer the thing over the words, place more
importance on his acts and life than on his speeches, more on the
gestures of his hand than his opinions.  not in his speech, not in his
thoughts, i see his greatness, only in his actions, in his life."

for a long time, the two old men said nothing.  then spoke govinda,
while bowing for a farewell:  "i thank you, siddhartha, for telling me
some of your thoughts.  they are partially strange thoughts, not all
have been instantly understandable to me.  this being as it may, i thank
you, and i wish you to have calm days."

(but secretly he thought to himself:  this siddhartha is a bizarre
person, he expresses bizarre thoughts, his teachings sound foolish.
so differently sound the exalted one's pure teachings, clearer, purer,
more comprehensible, nothing strange, 
 
 ___________________________
 
after our exalted gotama has become one with the
nirvana, never since then have i met a person of whom i felt: this is a
holy man!  only him, this siddhartha, i have found to be like this.  may
his teachings be strange, may his words sound foolish; out of his gaze
and his hand, his skin and his hair, out of every part of him shines a
purity, shines a calmness, shines a cheerfulness and mildness and
holiness, which i have seen in no other person since the final death of
our exalted teacher.)

as govinda thought like this, and there was a conflict in his heart, he
once again bowed to siddhartha, drawn by love.  deeply he bowed to him
who was calmly sitting.

"siddhartha," he spoke, "we have become old men.  it is unlikely for
one of us to see the other again in this incarnation.  i see, beloved,
that you have found peace.  i confess that i haven't found it.  tell me,
oh honourable one, one more word, give me something on my way which i
can grasp, which i can understand!  give me something to be

my path.  it is often hard, my path, often dark, siddhartha."

siddhartha said nothing and looked at him with the ever unchanged,
quiet smile.  govinda stared at his face, with fear, with yearning,
suffering, and the eternal search was visible in his look, eternal
not-finding.

siddhartha saw it and smiled.

"bend down to me!" he whispered quietly in govinda's ear.  "bend down to
me!  like this, even closer!  very close!  kiss my forehead, govinda!"

but while govinda with astonishment, and yet drawn by great love and
expectation, obeyed his words, bent down closely to him and touched his
forehead with his lips, something miraculous happened to him.  while his
thoughts were still dwelling on siddhartha's wondrous words, while he
was still struggling in vain and with reluctance to think away time, to
imagine nirvana and sansara as one, while even a certain contempt for
the words of his friend was fighting in him against an immense love and
veneration, this ha

ays re-born, received evermore a new face, without any time
having passed between the one and the other face--and all of these
figures and faces rested, flowed, generated themselves, floated along
and merged with each other, and they were all constantly covered by
something thin, without individuality of its own, but yet existing, like
a thin glass or ice, like a transparent skin, a shell or mold or mask of
water, and this mask was smiling, and this mask was siddhartha's smiling
face, which he, govinda, in this very same moment touched with his lips.
and, govinda saw it like this, this smile of the mask, this smile of
oneness above the flowing forms, this smile of simultaneousness above
the thousand births and deaths, this smile of siddhartha was precisely
the same, was precisely of the same kind as the quiet, delicate,
