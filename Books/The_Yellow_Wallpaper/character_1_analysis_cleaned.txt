[CHARACTER]
though [CHARACTER] seems like the obvious villain of "the yellow wallpaper," the
story does not allow us to see him as wholly evil. [CHARACTER]'s treatment of the
narrator's depression goes terribly wrong, but in all likelihood he was trying
to help her, not make her worse. the real problem with [CHARACTER] is the
all-encompassing authority he has in his combined role as the narrator's husband
and doctor. [CHARACTER] is so sure that he knows what's best for his wife that he
disregards her own opinion of the matter, forcing her to hide her true feelings.
he consistently patronizes her. he calls her "a blessed little goose" and vetoes
her smallest wishes, such as when he refuses to switch bedrooms so as not to
overindulge her "fancies." further, his dry, clinical rationality renders him
uniquely unsuited to understand his imaginative wife. he does not intend to harm
her, but his ignorance about what she really needs ultimately proves dangerous.
[CHARACTER] knows his wife only superficially. he sees the "outer pattern" but
misses the trapped, struggling woman inside. this ignorance is why [CHARACTER] is no
mere cardboard villain. he cares for his wife, but the unequal relationship in
which they find themselves prevents him from truly understanding her and her
problems. by treating her as a "case" or a "wife" and not as a person with a
will of her own, he helps destroy her, which is the last thing he wants. that
[CHARACTER] has been destroyed by this imprisoning relationship is made clear by the
story's chilling finale. after breaking in on his insane wife, [CHARACTER] faints in
shock and goes unrecognized by his wife, who calls him "that man" and complains
about having to "creep over him" as she makes her way along the wall.
