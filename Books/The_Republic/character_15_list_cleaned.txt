[CHARACTER] - 
                according
to plato, [CHARACTER] can only pertain to eternal, unchanging truths.
i can know, for instance that two plus two equals four, because
this will also be the case. i cannot know, however, that meno is beautiful.
for this reason, only the intelligible realm, the realm of the forms
can be the object of [CHARACTER]. see also opinion.
