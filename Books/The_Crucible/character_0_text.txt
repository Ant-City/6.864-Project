betty: i’ll fly to mama. let me fly! she raises her arms as though to fly, and streaks for

proctor was a farmer in his middle thirties, he need not have been a partisan of any 
faction in the town, but there is evidence to suggest that he had a sharp and biting way 
with hypocrites. he was the kind of man - powerful of body, even-tempered, and not 
easily  led  -  who  cannot  refuse  support  to  partisans  with-out  drawing  their  deepest 
resentment. in proctor’s presence a fool felt his foolishness instantly - and a proctor is

my ruth to watch. good morning, mr. proctor. 
 
mercy  sidles  out.  since  proctor’s  entrance,  abigail  has  stood  as  though  on 
tiptoe, absorbing his presence, wide-eyed. he glances at her, then goes to betty 
on the bed. 
 
abigail: gah! i’d almost forgot how strong you are, john proctor! 
 
proctor, looking at abigail now, the faintest suggestion of a knowing smile on 
his face: what’s this mischief here? 
 
abigail, with a nervous laugh: oh, she’s only gone silly some-how. 
 
proctor:  the  road  past  my  house  is  a  pilgrimage  to  salem  all  morning.  the

of giles’ tolerance with this: is it the devil’s fault that a man cannot say you

at the right is a door opening on the fields outside. a fireplace is at the left, and behind 
it a stairway leading upstairs. it is the low, dark, and rather long living room of the 
time.  as  the  curtain  rises,  the  room  is  empty.  from  above,  elizabeth  is  heard  softly 
singing to the children. presently the door opens and john proctor enters, carrying his 
gun.  he  glances  about  the  room  as  he  comes  toward  the  fireplace, then halts for an 
instant as he hears her singing. he continues on to the fireplace, leans the gun against 
the wall as he swings a pot out of the fire and smells it. then he lifts out the ladle and 
tastes. he is not quite pleased. he reaches to a cupboard, takes a pinch of salt, and 
drops it into the pot. as he is tasting again, her footsteps are heard on the stair. he

you know it well! 
 
quite suddenly, as though from the air, a figure appears in the doorway. they

hand toward hale: peace. what would you tell us, mary warren?

danforth: she will not? 
 
proctor: never, sir, never. 
 
danforth: we have thought it too convenient to be credited. however, if i 
should tell you now that i will let her be kept another month; and if she begin to 
show her natural signs, you shall have her living yet another year until she is 
delivered - what say you to that? john proctor is struck silent. come now. you 
say your only purpose is to save your wife. good, then, she is saved at least this 
year, and a year is long. what say ' you, sir? it is done now. in convict, proctor 
glances at francis and giles. will you drop this charge? 
 
proctor: i - i think i cannot.

proctor  hands  it  to  him.  hathorne  rises,  goes  beside  danforth,  and  starts 
reading. parris comes to his other side. danforth looks at john proctor, then 
proceeds to read. hale gets up, finds position near the judge, reads too. proctor 
glances at giles. francis prays silently, hands pressed together. cheever waits 
placidly,  the  sublime  official,  dutiful.  mary  warren  sobs  once.  john  proctor 
touches her head reassuringly. presently danforth

o god, that confession surely damns the others in the public eye, and 
none  may  doubt more that they are all linked to hell. this way, unconfessed 
and claiming innocence, doubts are multiplied, many honest people will weep 
for them, and our good purpose is lost in their tears.

cheever opens the dispatch case, searches. 
 
parris:  it  cannot  be  forgot,  sir,  that  when  i  summoned  the  con-gregation  for

danforth, studying the list: there will be no postponement.

a sound - the sibilance of dragging feet on stone. they turn. a pause. herrick 
enters with john proctor. his wrists are chained. he is another man, bearded, 
filthy, his eyes misty as though webs had overgrown them. he halts inside the 
doorway, his eye caught by the sight of elizabeth. the emotion flowing between 
them prevents anyone from speaking for an instant. wow hale, visibly affected, 
goes to danforth and speaks quietly.  
hale: pray, leave them, excellency.

back to her. it is evil, is it not? it is evil.

proctor: then who will judge me? suddenly clasping his hands: god in heaven, what is 
john proctor, what is john proctor? he moves as an animal, and a fury is riding in him, 
a tantalized search. i think it is honest, i think so; i am no saint. as though she had 
denied this he calls angrily at her: let rebecca go like a saint; for me it is fraud! 
 
voices are heard in the hall, speaking together in suppressed excitement.
