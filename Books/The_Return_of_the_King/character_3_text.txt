chapter 2

the passing of the grey company

gandalf was gone, and the thudding hoofs of shadowfax were lost in the night, when merry came back to aragorn. he had only a light bundle, for he had lost his pack at parth galen, and all he had was a few useful things he had picked up among the wreckage of isengard. hasufel was already saddled. legolas and gimli with their horse stood close by.
â€˜so four of the company still remain,â€™ said aragorn. â€˜we will ride on together. but we shall not go alone, as i thought. the king is now determined to set out at once. since the coming of the winged shadow, he desires to return to the hills under cover of night.â€™
â€˜and then whither?â€™ said legolas.
â€˜i cannot say yet,â€™ aragorn answered. â€˜as for the king, he will go to the muster that he commanded at edoras, four nights from now. and ther

â€˜i for one!â€™ cried legolas. â€˜and gimli with him!â€™ said the dwarf.
â€˜well, for myself,â€™ said aragorn, â€˜it is dark before me. i must go down also to minas tirith, but i do not yet see the road. an hour long prepared approaches.â€™
â€˜donâ€™t leave me behind!â€™ said merry. â€˜i have not been of much use yet; but i donâ€™t want to be laid aside, like baggage to be called for when all is over. i donâ€™t think the riders will want to be bothered with me now. though, of course, the king did say that i was to sit by hi

m when he came to his house and tell him all about the shire.â€™
â€˜yes,â€™ said aragorn, â€˜and your road lies with him, i think, merry. but do not look for mirth at the ending. it will be long, i fear, ere thÃ©oden sits at ease again in meduseld. many hopes will wither in this bitter spring.â€™
soon all were ready to depart: twenty-four horses, with gimli behind legolas, and merry in front of aragorn. presently they were riding swiftly through the night. they had not long passed the mounds at the fords of isen, when a rider galloped up from the rear of their line.
â€˜my lord,â€™ he said to the king, â€˜there are horsemen behind us. as we crossed the fords i thought that i heard them. now we are sure. they are overtaking us, riding hard.â€™
thÃ©oden at once called a halt. the riders turned about and seized their spears. aragorn dismounted and set merry on the g

and aragorn said: â€˜now i know what you bear. bear it still for me a while!â€™ and he turned and looked away to the north under the great stars, and then he fell silent and spoke no more while the nightâ€™s journey lasted.
the night was old and the east grey when they rode up at last from deeping-coomb and came back to the hornburg. there they were to lie and rest for a brief while and take counsel.
merry slept until he was roused by legolas and gimli. â€˜the sun is high,â€™ said legolas. â€˜all others are up and doing. come, master sluggard, and look at this place while you may!â€™
â€˜there was a battle here three nights ago,â€™ said gimli, â€˜and here legolas and i played a game that i won only by a single orc. come and see how it was! and there are caves, merry, caves of wonder! shall we visit them, legolas, do you think?â€™
â€˜nay! there is no time,â€™ said the elf. â€˜do not spoil the wonder with haste! i have given you my wor

d to return hither with you, if a day of peace and freedom comes again. but it is now near to noon, and at that hour we eat, and then set out again, i hear.â€™
merry got up and yawned. his few hoursâ€™ sleep had not been nearly enough; he was tired and rather dismal. he missed pippin, and felt that he was only a burden, while everybody was making plans for speed in a business that he did not fully understand. â€˜where is aragorn?â€™ he asked.
â€˜in a high chamber of the burg,â€™ said legolas. â€˜he has neither rested nor slept, i think. he went thither some hours ago, saying that he must take thought, and only his kinsman, halbarad, went with him; but some dark doubt or care sits on him.â€™
â€˜they are a strange company, these newcomers,â€™ said gimli. â€˜stout men and lordly they are, and the riders of rohan look almost as boys beside them; for they are grim men of face, worn like weathered rocks for the most part, even as aragorn himself; and they are silent.â€™
â€˜but even as ar

â€˜why have they come? have you heard?â€™ asked merry. he had now dressed, and he flung his grey cloak about his shoulders; and the three passed out together towards the ruined gate of the burg.
â€˜they answered a summons, as you heard,â€™ said gimli. â€˜word came to rivendel

l, they say: aragorn has need of his kindred. let the dÃºnedain ride to him in rohan! but whence this message came they are now in doubt. gandalf sent it, i would guess.â€™
â€˜nay, galadriel,â€™ said legolas. â€˜did she not speak through gandalf of the ride of the grey company from the north?â€™
â€˜yes, you have it,â€™ said gimli. â€˜the lady of the wood! she read many hearts and desires. now why did not we wish for some of our own kinsfolk, legolas?â€™
legolas stood before the gate and turned his bright eyes away north and east, and his fair face was troubled. â€˜i do not think that any would come,â€™ he answered. â€˜they have no need to ride to war; war already marches on their own lands.â€™
for a while the three companions walked together, speaking of this and that turn of the battle, and they went down from the broken gate, and passed the mounds of the fallen on the greensward beside the road, until they stood on helmâ€™s dike and looked into the

the king mounted his horse, snowmane, and merry sat beside him on his pony: stybba was his name. presently Ã©omer came out from the gate, and with him was aragorn, and halbarad bearing the great staff close-furled in black, and two tall men, neither young nor old so much alike were they, the sons of elrond, that few could tell them apart: dark-haired, grey-eyed, and their faces elven-fair, clad alike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver-grey. behind them walked legolas and gimli. but merry had eyes only for aragorn, so startling was the change that he saw in him, as if in one night many years had fallen on his head. grim was his face, grey-hued and weary.
â€˜i am troubled in mind, lord,â€™ he said, standing by the kingâ€™s horse. â€˜i have heard strange words, and i see new perils far off. i have laboured long in thought, and now i fear that i must change my purpose. tell me, thÃ©oden, you ride now to dunharrow, how long will it be ere you come there?â€™
â€˜i

â€˜you will do as you will, my lord aragorn,â€™ said thÃ©oden. â€˜it is your doom, maybe, to tread strange paths that others dare not. this parting grieves me, and my strength is lessened by it; but now i must take the mountain-roads and delay no longer. farewell!â€™
â€˜farewell, lord!â€™ said aragorn. â€˜ride unto great renown! farewell, merry! i leave you in good hands, better than we hoped when we hunted the orcs to fangorn. legolas and gimli will still hunt with me, i hope; but we shall not forget you.â€™
â€˜good-bye!â€™ said merry. he could find no more to say. he felt very small, and he was puzzled and depressed by all these gloomy words. more than ever he missed the unquenchable cheerfulness of pippin. the riders were ready, and their horses were fidgeting; he wished they would start arid get it over.
now thÃ©oden spoke to Ã©omer, and he lifted up his hand and cried aloud, and with that word the riders set forth. they

â€˜a little people, but of great worth are the shire-folk,â€™ said halbarad. â€˜little do they know of our long labour for the safekeeping of their borders, and yet i grudge it not.â€™
â€˜and now our fates are woven together,â€™ said aragorn. â€˜and yet, alas! here we must part. well, i must eat a little, and then we also must hasten away. come, legolas and gimli! i must speak with you as i eat.â€™
together they went back into the burg; yet for some time aragorn sat silent at the table in the hall, and the others waited for him to speak. â€˜come!â€™ said legolas at last. â€˜speak and be comforted, and shake off the shadow! what has happened since we came back to this grim place in the grey morning?â€™
â€˜a struggle somewhat grimmer for my part than the battle of the hornburg,â€™ answered aragorn. â€˜i have looked in the stone of orthanc, my fr

â€˜the living have never used that road since the coming of the rohirrim,â€™ said aragorn, â€˜for it is closed to them. but in this dark hour the heir of isildur may use it, if he dare. listen! this is the word that the sons of elrond bring to me from their father in rivendell, wisest in lore: bid aragorn remember the words of the seer, and the paths of the dead.â€™
â€˜and what may be the words of the seer?â€™ said legolas.
â€œthus spoke malbeth the seer, in the days of arvedui, last king at fornost,â€™ said aragorn:
over the land there lies a long shadow,
westward reaching wings of darkness.
the tower trembles; to the tombs of kings
doom approaches. the dead awaken;
for the hour is come for the oathbreakers;
at the stone of erech they shall stand again
and hear there a horn in the hills ringing.
whose shall the horn be? who shall call them
from the prey twilight, the forgotten people?

â€˜if you would understand them better, then i bid you come with me,â€™ said aragorn; â€˜for that way i now shall take. but i do not go gladly; only need drives me. therefore, only of your free will would i have you come, for you will find both toil and great fear, and maybe worse.â€™
â€˜i will go with you even on the paths of the dead, and to whatever, end they may lead,â€™ said gimli.
â€˜i also will come,â€™ said legolas, â€˜for i do not fear the dead.â€™
â€˜i hope that the forgotten people will not have forgotten how to fight,â€™ said gimli; â€˜for otherwise i see not why we should trouble them.â€™
â€˜that we shall know if ever we come to erech,â€™ said aragorn. â€˜but the oath that they broke was to fight against sauron, and they must fight therefore, if they are to fulfil it. for at erech there stands yet a black stone that was brought, it was said, from nÃºmenor by isildur; and it was set upon a hill, and u

he stood up. â€˜come!â€™ he cried, and drew his sword, and it flashed in the twilit hall of the burg. â€˜to the stone of erech! i seek the paths of the dead. come with me who will!â€™
legolas and gimli made no answer, but they rose and followed aragorn from the hall. on the green there waited, still and silent, the hooded rangers. legolas and gimli mounted. aragorn sprang upon roheryn. then halbarad lifted a great horn, and the blast of it echoed in helmâ€™s deep; and with that they leapt away, riding down the coomb like thunder, while all the men that were left on dike or burg stared in amaze.
and while thÃ©oden went by slow paths in the hills, the grey company passed swiftly over

then they said no more, and they ate in silence; but her eyes were ever upon aragorn, and the others saw that she was in great torment of mind. at length they arose, and took their leave of the lady, and thanked her for her care, and went to their rest.
but as aragorn came to the booth where he was to lodge with legolas and gimli, and his companions had gone in. there came the lady Ã©owyn after him and called to him. he turned and saw her as a glimmer in the night, for she was clad in white; but her eyes were on fire.
â€˜aragorn,â€™ she said, â€˜why will you go on this deadly road?â€™
â€˜because i must,â€™ he said. â€˜only so can i see any hope of doing my part in the war against sauron. i do not choose paths of peril, Ã©owyn. were i to go where my heart dwells, far in the north i would now be wandering in the

then it seemed to gimli and legolas who were nearby that she wept, and in one so stern and proud that seemed the more grievous. but she said: â€˜aragorn, wilt thou go?â€™
â€˜i will,â€™ he said.
â€˜then wilt thou not let me ride with this company, as i have asked?â€™
â€˜i will not, lady,â€™ he said. â€˜for that i could not grant without leave of the king and of your brother; and they will not return until tomorrow. but i count now every hour, indeed every minute. farewell!â€™
then she fell on her knees, saying: â€˜i beg thee!â€™

ome forth until the day was up, and the reckless strangers were gone.
and some said: â€˜they are elvish wights. let them go where they belong, into the dark places, and never return. the times are evil enough.â€™
the light was still grey as they rode, for the sun had not yet climbed over the black ridges of the haunted mountain before them. a dread fell on them, even as they passed between the lines of ancient stones and so came to the dimholt. there under the gloom of black trees that not even legolas could long endure they found a hollow place opening at the mountainâ€™s root, and right in their path stood a single mighty stone like a finger of doom.
â€˜my blood runs chill,â€™ said gimli, but the others were silent, and his voice fell dead on the dank fir-needles at his feet. the horses would not pass the threatening stone, until the riders dismounted and led them about. and so they came at last deep into the glen; and there stood a sheer wall of rock, and in the wall the dark door gaped be

fore them like the mouth of night. signs and figures were carved above its wide arch too dim to read, and fear flowed from it like a grey vapour.
the company halted, and there was not a heart among them that did not quail, unless it were the heart of legolas of the elves, for whom the ghosts of men have no terror.
â€˜this is an evil door,â€™ said halbarad, â€˜and my death lies beyond it. i will dare to pass it nonetheless; but no horse will enter.â€™
â€˜but we must go in, and therefore the horses must go too,â€™ said aragorn. â€˜for if ever we come through this darkness, many leagues lie beyond, and every hour that is lost there will bring the triumph of sauron nearer. follow me!â€™
then aragorn led the way, and such was the strength of his will in

 that hour that all the dÃºnedain and their horses followed him. and indeed the love that the horses of the rangers bore for their riders was so great that they were willing to face even the terror of the door, if their mastersâ€™ hearts were steady as they walked beside them. but arod, the horse of rohan, refused the way, and he stood sweating and trembling in a fear that was grievous to see. then legolas laid his hands on his eyes and sang some words that went soft in the gloom, until he suffered himself to be led, and legolas passed in. and there stood gimli the dwarf left all alone.
his knees shook, and he was wroth with himself. â€˜here is a thing unheard of!â€™ he said. â€˜an elf will go underground and a dwarf dare not!â€™ with that he plunged in. but it seemed to him that he dragged his feet like lead over the threshold; and at once a blindness came upon him, even upon gimli glÃ³inâ€™s so

the company now mounted again, and gimli returned to legolas. they rode in file, and evening came on and a deep blue dusk; and still fear pursued them. legolas turning to speak to gimli looked back and the dwarf saw before his face the glitter in the elfâ€™s bright eyes. behind them rode elladan, last of the company, but not the last of those that took the downward road.
â€˜the dead are following,â€™ said legolas. â€˜i see shapes of men and of horses, and pale banners like shreds of cloud, and spears like winter-thickets on a misty night. the dead are fo

a sigh was heard again all the long night. the company camped beside the stone, but they slept little, because of the dread of the shadows that hedged them round.
but when the dawn came, cold and pale, aragorn rose at once, and he led the company forth upon the journey of greatest haste and weariness that any among them had known, save he alone, and only his will held them to go on. no other mortal men could have endured it, none but the dÃºnedain of the north, and with them gimli the dwarf and legolas of the elves.
they passed tarlangâ€™s neck and came into lamedon; and the shadow host pressed behind and fear went on before them, until they came to calembel upon ciril, and the sun went down like blood behind pinnath gelin away in the west behind them. the township and the fords of ciril they found deserted, for many men had gone away to war, and all that were left fled to the hills at the rumour of the coming of the king of the dead. but the next day there came no dawn, and the grey company

using. it was a language in which there seemed to be many words that he knew, though spoken more richly and strongly than in the shire, yet he could not piece the words together. at times some rider would lift up his clear voice in stirring song, and merry felt his heart leap, though he did not know what it was about.
all the same he had been lonely, and never more so than now at the dayâ€™s end. he wondered where in all this strange world pippin had got to; and what would become of aragorn and legolas and gimli. then suddenly like a cold touch on his heart he thought of frodo and sam. â€˜i am forgetting them!â€™ he said to himself reproachfully. â€˜and yet they are more important than all the rest of us. and i came to help them; but now they must be hundreds of miles away, if they are still alive.â€™ he shivered.
â€˜harrowdale at last!â€™ said Ã©omer. â€˜our journey is almost at an end.â€™ they halted. the paths out of the narrow gorge fell steeply. only a glimpse, as through a tall window,

nd the half-seen heads of the mountains westward were crowned with stars, but the east was dark and blank. the marching stones faded slowly from sight, but still beyond them, blacker than the gloom, brooded the vast crouching shadow of the dwimorberg.
â€˜the paths of the dead,â€™ he muttered to himself. â€˜the paths of the dead? what does all this mean? they have all left me now. they have all gone to some doom: gandalf and pippin to war in the east; and sam and frodo to mordor; and strider and legolas and gimli to the paths of the dead. but my turn will come soon enough, i suppose. i wonder what they are all talking about, and what the king means to do. for i must go where he goes now.â€™
in the midst of these gloomy thoughts he suddenly remembered that he was very hungry, and he got up to go and see if anyone else in this strange camp felt the same. but at that very moment a trumpet sounded, and a man came summoning him, the kingâ€™s esquire, to wait at the kingâ€™s board.

east rode the knights of dol amroth driving the enemy before them: troll-men and variags and orcs that hated the sunlight. south strode Ã©omer and men fled before his face, and they were caught between the hammer and the anvil. for now men leaped from the ships to the quays of the harlond and swept north like a storm. there came legolas, and gimli wielding his axe, and halbarad with the standard, and elladan and elrohir with stars on their brow, and the dour-handed dÃºnedain, rangers of the north, leading a great valour of the folk of lebennin and lamedon and the fiefs of the south. but before all went aragorn with the flame of the west, andÃºril like a new fire kindled, narsil re-forged as deadly as of old: and upon his brow was the star of elendil.
and so at length Ã©omer and aragorn met in the midst of the battle, and they

and when he could labour no more, he cast his cloak about him, and slipped out of the city, and went to his tent just ere dawn and slept for a little. and in the morning the banner of dol amroth, a white ship like a swan upon blue water, floated from the tower, and men looked up and wondered if the coming of the king had been but a dream.

chapter 9

the last debate

the morning came after the day of battle, and it was fair with light clouds and the wind turning westward. legolas and gimli were early abroad, and they begged leave to go up into the city; for they were eager to see merry and pippin.
â€˜it is good to learn that they are still alive,â€™ said gimli; â€˜for they cost us great pains in our march over rohan, and i would not have such pains all wasted.â€™
together the elf and the dwarf entered minas tirith, and folk that saw them pass marvelled to see such companions; for legolas was fair of face beyond the measure of men, and he sang an elven-song in a clear vo

ice as he walked in the morning; but gimli stalked beside him, stroking his beard and staring about him.
â€˜there is some good stone-work here,â€™ he said as he looked at the walls; â€˜but also some that is less good, and the streets could be better contrived. when aragorn comes into his own, i shall offer him the service of stonewrights of the mountain, and we will make this a town to be proud of.â€™
â€˜they need more gardens,â€™ said legolas. â€˜the houses are dead, and there is too little here that grows and is glad. if aragorn comes into his own, the people of the wood shall bring him birds that sing and trees that do not die.â€™
at length they came to the prince imrahil, and legolas looked at him and bowed low; for he saw that here indeed was one who had elven-blood in his veins. â€˜hail, lord!â€™ he said. â€˜it is long since the people of nimrodel left the woodlands of lÃ³rien, and yet still one may see that not all sailed from

 amrothâ€™s haven west over water.â€™
â€˜so it is said in the lore of my land,â€™ said the prince; â€˜yet never has one of the fair folk been seen there for years beyond count. and i marvel to see one here now in the midst of sorrow and war. what do you seek?â€™
â€˜i am one of the nine companions who set out with mithrandir from imladris, said legolas and with this dwarf, my friend, i came with the lord aragorn. but now we wish to see our friends. meriadoc and peregrin, who are in your keeping, we are told.â€™
â€˜you will find them in the houses of healing, and i will lead you thither,â€™ said imrahil.
â€˜it will be enough if you send one to guide us, lord,â€™ said legolas. â€˜for aragorn sends this message to you. he does not wish to enter the city again at this time. yet there is need for the captains to hold council at once, and he prays

that you and Ã©omer of rohan will come down to his tents, as soon as may be. mithrandir is already there.â€™
â€˜we will come,â€™ said imrahil; and they parted with courteous words.
â€˜that is a fair lord and a great captain of men,â€™ said legolas. â€˜if gondor has such men still in these days of fading, great must have been its glory in the days of its rising.â€™
â€˜and doubtless the good stone-work is the older and was wrought in the first building,â€™ said gimli. â€˜it is ever so with the things that men begin: there is a frost in spring, or a blight in summer, and they fail of their promise.â€™
â€˜yet seldom do they fail of their seed,â€™ said legolas. â€˜and that will lie in the dust and rot to spring up again in times and places un

â€˜and yet come to naught in the end but might-have-beens, i guess,â€™ said the dwarf.
â€˜to that the elves know not the answer,â€™ said legolas.
with that the servant of the prince came and led them to the houses of healing; and there they found their friends in the garden, and their meeting was a merry one. for a while they walked and talked, rejoicing for a brief space in peace and rest under the morning high up in the windy circles of the city. then when merry became weary, they went and sat upon the wall with the greensward of the houses of healing behind them; and away southward before them was the anduin glittering in the sun, as

 it flowed away, out of the sight even of legolas, into the wide flats and green haze of lebennin and south ithilien.
and now legolas fell silent, while the others talked, and he looked out against the sun, and as he gazed he saw white sea-birds beating up the river.
â€˜look!â€™ he cried. â€˜gulls! they are flying far inland. a wonder they are to me and a trouble to my heart. never in all my life had i met them, until we came to pelargir, and there i heard them crying in the air as we rode to the battle of the ships. then i stood still, forgetting war in middle-earth; for their wailing voices spoke to me of the sea. the sea!

alas! i have not yet beheld it. but deep in the hearts of all my kindred lies the sea-longing, which it is perilous to stir. alas! for the gulls. no peace shall i have again under beech or under elm.â€™
â€˜say not so!â€™ said gimli. â€˜there are countless things still to see in middle-earth, and great works to do. but if all the fair folk take to the havens, it will be a duller world for those who are doomed to stay.â€™
â€˜dull and dreary indeed!â€™ said merry: â€˜you must not go to the havens, legolas. there will always be some folk, big or little, and even a few wise dwarves like gimli, who need you. at least i hope so. though i feel somehow that the worst of this war is still to come. how i wish it was all over, and well over!â€™
â€˜donâ€™t be so gloomy!â€™ cried pippin. â€˜the sun is shining, and here we are together for a day or two at least. i want to hear more about you all. come, gimli! you and legolas have mentioned your strange journey with strider about a dozen times already this m

â€˜the paths of the dead?â€™ said pippin. â€˜i heard aragorn say that and i wondered what he could mean. wonâ€™t you tell us some more?â€™
â€˜not willingly,â€™ said gimli. â€˜for upon that road i was put to shame: gimli glÃ³inâ€™s son, who had deemed himself more tough than men, and hardier under earth than any elf. but neither did i prove; and i was held to the road only by the will of aragorn.â€™
â€˜and by the love of him also,â€™ said legolas. â€˜for all those who come to know him come to love him after his own fashion, even the cold maiden of the rohirrim. it was at early morn of the day ere you came there, merry, that we left dunharrow, and such a fear was on all the folk that none would look on our going, save the lady Ã©owyn, who lies now hurt in the house below. there was grief at that parting, and i was grieved to behold it.â€™

swiftly then he told of the haunted road under the mountains, and the dark tryst at erech, and the great ride thence, ninety leagues and three, to pelargir on anduin. â€˜four days and nights, and on into a fifth, we rode from the black stone,â€™ he said. â€˜and lo! in the darkness of mordor my hope rose; for in that gloom the shadow host seemed

e behind, if they dared, when the grey host had passed.
â€˜ â€œat pelargir the heir of isildur will have need of you,â€ he said.
â€˜thus we crossed over gilrain, driving the allies of mordor in rout before us; and then we rested a while. but soon aragorn arose, saying: â€œlo! already minas tirith is assailed. i fear that it will fall ere we come to its aid.â€ so we mounted again before night had passed and went on with all the speed that our horses could endure over the plains of lebennin.â€™
legolas paused and sighed, and turning his eyes southward softly he sang:
silver flow the streams from celos to erui
in the green fields of lebennin!
tall grows the grass there. in the wind from the sea
the white lilies sway,
and the golden bells are shaken of mallos and alfirin
in the green fields of lebennin,
in the wind from the sea!
â€˜green are those fields in the songs of my people; but they were dark then, grey wastes in the blackness before us. and over the wide land, trampling unheeded the gra

 the great ships that remained aragorn sent one of the dÃºnedain, and they comforted the captives that were aboard, and bade them put aside fear and be free.
â€˜ere that dark day ended none of the enemy were left to resist us all were drowned, or were flying south in the hope to find their own lands upon foot. strange and wonderful i thought it that the designs of mordor should be overthrown by such wraiths of fear and darkness. with its own weapons was it worsted!â€™
â€˜strange indeed,â€™ said legolas. â€˜in that hour i looked on aragorn and thought how great and terrible a lord he might have become in the strength of his will, had he taken the ring to himself. not for naught does mordor fear him. but nobler is his spirit than the understanding of sauron; for is he not of the children of lÃºthien? never shall that line fail, though the years may lengthen beyond count.â€™
â€˜beyond the eyes of the dwarves are such foretellings,â€™ said gimli. â€˜but mighty indeed was aragorn that day. lo! all

ill aragorn was driven by fear that time was too short.
â€˜ â€œit is forty leagues and two from pelargir to the landings at the harlond,â€ he said. â€œyet to the harlond we must come tomorrow or fail utterly.â€
â€˜the oars were now wielded by free men, and manfully they laboured; yet slowly we passed up the great river, for we strove against its stream, and though that is not swift down in the south, we had no help of wind. heavy would my heart have been, for all our victory at the havens, if legolas had not laughed suddenly.
â€˜ â€œup with your beard, durinâ€™s son! â€œ he said. â€œfor thus is it spoken: oft hope is born, when all is forlorn.â€ but what hope he saw from afar he would not tell. when night came it did but deepen the darkness, and our hearts were hot, for away in the north we saw a red glow under the cloud, and aragorn said: â€œminas tirith is burning.â€
â€˜but at midnight hope was indeed born anew. sea-crafty men of the ethir gazing southward spoke of a change coming with

a fresh wind from the sea. long ere day the masted ships hoisted sail; and our speed grew, until dawn whitened the foam at our prows. and so it was, as you know, that we came in the third hour of the morning with a fair wind and the sun unveiled, and we unfurled the great standard in battle. it was a great day and a great hour, whatever may come after.â€™
â€˜follow what may, great deeds are not lessened in worth,â€™ said legolas. â€˜great deed was the riding of the paths of the dead, and great it shall remain, though none be left in gondor to sing of it in the days that are to come.â€™
â€˜and that may well befall,â€™ said gimli. â€˜for the faces of aragorn and gandalf are grave. much i wonder what counsels they are taking in the tents there below. for my part, like merry, i wish that with our victory the war was now over. yet whatever is still to do, i hope to have a part in it, for the honour of the folk of the lonely

 mountain.â€™
â€˜and i for the folk of the great wood,â€™ said legolas, â€˜and for the love of the lord of the white tree.â€™
then the companions fell silent, but a while they sat there in the high place, each busy with his own thoughts, while the captains debated.
when the prince imrahil had parted from legolas and gimli, at once he sent for Ã©omer; and he went down with him from the city, and they came to the tents of aragorn that were set up on the field not far from the place where king thÃ©oden had fallen. and there they took counsel together with gandalf and aragorn and the sons of elrond.
â€˜my lords,â€™ said gandalf, â€˜listen to the words of the steward of gondor before he died: you may triumph on the fields of the pelennor for a day, but against the power that has now arisen there is no victo

ys later the army of the west was all assembled on the pelennor. the host of orcs and easterlings had turned back out of anÃ³rien, but harried and scattered by the rohirrim they had broken and fled with little fighting towards cair andros; and with that threat destroyed and new strength arriving out of the south the city was as well manned as might be. scouts reported that no enemies remained upon the roads east as far as the cross-roads of the fallen king. all now was ready for the last throw.
legolas and gimli were to ride again together in the company of aragorn and gandalf, who went in the van with the dÃºnedain and the sons of elrond. but merry to his shame was not to go with them.
â€˜you are not fit for such a journey,â€™ said aragorn. â€˜but do not be ashamed. if you do no more in this war, you have already earned great honour. peregrin shall go and represent the shirefolk; and do not grudge him his chance of peril, for though he has done as well as his fortune allowed him, he has yet

men went wide about westward and came up on the flank of the enemy and from behind, and they were destroyed or driven east into the hills.
but the victory did little to enhearten the captains. â€˜it is but a feint,â€™ said aragorn; â€˜and its chief purpose, i deem, was rather to draw us on by a false guess of our enemyâ€™s weakness than to do us much hurt, yet.â€™ and from that evening onward the nazgÃ»l came and followed every move of the army. they still flew high and out of sight of all save legolas, and yet their presence could be felt, as a deepening of shadow and a dimming of the sun; and though the ringwraiths did not yet stoop low upon their foes and were silent, uttering no cry, the dread of them could not be shaken off.
so time and the hopeless journey wore away. upon the fourth day from the cross-roads and the sixth from minas tirith they came at last to the end of the living lands, and began to pass into the desolation that lay before the gates of the pass of cirith gorgor; and th

in such array as could best be contrived; and they were drawn up on two great hills of blasted stone and earth that orcs had piled in years of labour. before them towards mordor lay like a moat a great mire of reeking mud and foul-smelling pools. when all was ordered, the captains rode forth towards the black gate with a great guard of horsemen and the banner and heralds and trumpeters. there was gandalf as chief herald, and aragorn with the sons of elrond, and Ã©omer of rohan, and imrahil; and legolas and gimli and peregrin were bidden to go also, so that all the enemies of mordor should have a witness.
they came within cry of the morannon, and unfurled the banner, and blew upon their trumpets; and the heralds stood out and sent their voices up over the battlement of mordor.
â€˜come forth!â€™ they cried. â€˜let the lord of the black land come forth! justice shall be done upon him. for wrongfully he has made war upon gondor and wrested its lands. therefore the king of gondor demands that he s

.
â€˜no, master! mr. bilbo gave it to you, and it goes with his silver coat; he would not wish anyone else to wear it now.â€™
frodo gave way; and gandalf, as if he were their esquire, knelt and girt the sword-belts about them, and then rising he set circlets of silver upon their heads. and when they were arrayed they went to the great feast; and they sat at the kingâ€™s table with gandalf, and king Ã©omer of rohan, and the prince imrahil and all the chief captains; and there also were gimli and legolas.
but when, after the standing silence, wine was brought there came in two esquires to serve the kings; or so they seemed to be: one was clad in the silver and sable of the guards of minas tirith, and the other in white and green. but sam wondered what such young boys were doing in an army of mighty men. then suddenly as they drew near and he could see them plainly, he exclaimed:
â€˜why, look mr. frodo! look here! well, if it isnâ€™t pippin. mr. peregrin took i should say, and mr. merry! how the

close as he used to be, though he laughs now more than he talks. for the present merry and i are busy. we are knights of the city and of the mark, as i hope you observe.â€™
at last the glad day ended; and when the sun was gone and the round moon rode slowly above the mists of anduin and flickered through the fluttering leaves, frodo and sam sat under the whispering trees amid the fragrance of fair ithilien; and they talked deep into the night with merry and pippin and gandalf, and after a while legolas and gimli joined them. there frodo and sam learned much of all that had happened to the company after their fellowship was broken on the evil day at parth galen by rauros falls; and still there was always more to ask and more to tell.
orcs, and talking trees, and leagues of grass, and galloping riders. and glittering caves, and white towers and golden halls, and battles, and tall ships sailing, all these passed before samâ€™s mind until he felt bewildered. but amidst all these wonders he return

â€˜and i,â€™ said legolas, â€˜shall walk in the woods of this fair land, which is rest enough. in days to come, if my elven-lord allows, some of our folk shall remove hither; and when we come it shall be blessed, for a while. for a while: a month, a life, a hundred years of men. but anduin is near, and anduin leads down to the sea. to the sea!
to the sea, to the sea! the white gulls are crying,
the wind is blowing, and the white foam is flying.
west, west away, the round sun is falling.

the voices of my people that have gone before me?
i will leave, i will leave the woods that bore me;
for our days are ending and our years failing.
i will pass the wide waters lonely sailing.
long are the waves on the last shore falling,
sweet are the voices in the lost isle calling,
in eressÃ«a, in elvenhome that no man can discover,
where the leaves fall not: land of my people for ever!â€™
and so singing legolas went away down the hill.
then the others also departed, and frodo and sam went to their beds and slept. and in the morning they rose again in hope and peace; and they spent many days in ithilien. for the field of cormallen, where the host was now encamped was near to henneth annÃ»n, and the stream that flowed from its falls could be heard in the night as it rushed down through its rocky gate, and passed through the flowery meads into the tides of anduin by the isle of cair andros. the hobbits w

 day of may the riders of rohan made ready, and rode off by the north-way, and with them went the sons of elrond. all the road was lined with people to do them honour and praise them, from the gate of the city to the walls of the pelennor. then all others that dwelt afar went back to their homes rejoicing; but in the city there was labour of many willing hands to rebuild and renew and to remove all the scars of war and the memory of the darkness.
the hobbits still remained in minas tirith, with legolas and gimli; for aragorn was loth for the fellowship to be dissolved. â€˜at last all such things must end,â€™ he said, â€˜but i would have you wait a little while longer: for the end of the deeds that you have shared in has not yet come. a day draws near that i have looked for in all the years of my manhood, and when it comes i would have my friends beside me.â€™ but of that day he would say no more.
in those days the companions of the ring dwelt together in a fair house with gandalf, and they we

th dÃ­nen, and they bore away king thÃ©oden upon a golden bier, and passed through the city in silence. then they laid the bier upon a great wain with riders of rohan all about it and his banner borne before; and merry being thÃ©odenâ€™s esquire rode upon the wain and kept the arms of the king.
for the other companions steeds were furnished according to their stature; and frodo and samwise rode at aragornâ€™s side, and gandalf rode upon shadowfax, and pippin rode with the knights of gondor; and legolas and gimli as ever rode together upon arod.
in that riding went also queen arwen, and celeborn and galadriel with their folk, and elrond and his sons; and the princes of dol amroth and of ithilien, and many captains and knights. never had any king of the mark such company upon the road as went with thÃ©oden thengelâ€™s son to the land of his home.
without haste and at peace they passed into anÃ³rien, and they came to the grey wood under amon din; and there they heard a sound as of drums beating

t it from the north. he that blows it at need shall set fear in the hearts of his enemies and joy in the hearts of his friends, and they shall hear him and come to him.â€™
then merry took the horn, for it could not be refused, and he kissed Ã©owynâ€™s hand; and they embraced him, and so they parted for that time.
now the guests were ready, and they drank the stirrup-cup, and with great praise and friendship they departed, and came at length to helmâ€™s deep, and there they rested two days. then legolas repaid his promise to gimli and went with him to the glittering caves; and when they returned he was silent, and would say only that gimli alone could find fit words to speak of them. â€˜and never before has a dwarf claimed a victory over an elf in a contest of words,â€™ said he. â€˜now therefore let us go to fangorn and set the score right!â€™
from deeping-coomb they rode to isengard, and saw how the ents had busied themselves. all the stone-circle had been thrown down and removed, and the lan

re are no entings.â€™
â€˜yet maybe there is now more hope in your search,â€™ said aragorn. â€˜lands will lie open to you eastward that have long been closed.â€™
but treebeard shook his head and said: â€˜it is far to go. and there are too many men there in these days. but i am forgetting my manners! will you stay here and rest a while? and maybe there are some that would be pleased to pass through fangorn forest and so shorten their road home?â€™ he looked at celeborn and galadriel.
but all save legolas said that they must now take their leave and depart, either south or west. â€˜come, gimli!â€™ said legolas. â€˜now by fangornâ€™s leave i will visit the deep places of the entwood and see such trees as are nowhere else to be found in middle-earth. you shall come with me and keep your word; and thus we will journey on together to our own lands in mirkwood and beyond.â€™ to this gimli agreed, though with no great delight, it seemed.
â€˜here then at last comes the ending of the fellowship of the r
