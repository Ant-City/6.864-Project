  now scarce the trojan fleet, with sails and oars,
  had left behind the fair sicilian shores,
  ent'ring with cheerful shouts the wat'ry reign,
  and plowing frothy furrows in the main;
  when, lab'ring still with endless discontent,
  the queen of heav'n did thus her fury vent:

  "then am i vanquish'd? must i yield?" said she,
  "and must the trojans reign in italy?
  so fate will have it, and jove adds his force;
  nor can my pow'r divert their happy course.
  could angry pallas, with revengeful spleen,
  the grecian navy burn, and drown the men?
  she, for the fault of one offending foe,
  the bolts of jove himself presum'd to throw:
  with whirlwinds from beneath she toss'd the ship,
  and bare expos'd the bosom of the deep;
  then, as an eagle gripes the trembling game,
  the wretch, yet hissing with her father's flame,
  she strongly seiz'd, and with a burning wound
  transfix'd, and naked, on a rock she bound.

  and give to pass the proud halesus' heart!
  his arms and spoils thy holy oak shall bear."
  pleas'd with the bribe, the god receiv'd his pray'r:
  for, while his shield protects a friend distress'd,
  the dart came driving on, and pierc'd his breast.

  but by his own example cheers the fight.
  fierce abas first he slew; abas, the stay
  of trojan hopes, and hindrance of the day.
  the phrygian troops escap'd the greeks in vain:
  they, and their mix'd allies, now load the plain.
  to the rude shock of war both armies came;
  their leaders equal, and their strength the same.
  the rear so press'd the front, they could not wield
  their angry weapons, to dispute the field.
  here pallas urges on, and lausus there:
  of equal youth and beauty both appear,
  but both by fate forbid to breathe their native air.
  their congress in the field great jove withstands:
  both doom'd to fall, but fall by greater hands.

  meantime juturna warns the daunian chief
  of lausus' danger, urging swift relief.
  with his driv'n chariot he divides the crowd,
  and, making to his friends, thus calls aloud:
  "let none presume his needless aid to join;
  retire, and clear the field; the fight is

  from the forbidden space his men retir'd.
  pallas their awe, and his stern words, admir'd;
  survey'd him o'er and o'er with wond'ring sight,
  struck with his haughty mien, and tow'ring height.
  then to the king: "your empty vaunts forbear;
  success i hope, and fate i cannot fear;
  alive or dead, i shall deserve a name;
  jove is impartial, and to both the same."
  he said, and to the void advanc'd his pace:
  pale horror sate on each arcadian face.
  then turnus, from his chariot leaping light,
  address'd himself on foot to single fight.

  and, as a lion- when he spies from far
  a bull that seems to meditate the war,
  bending his neck, and spurning back the sand-
  runs roaring downward from his hilly stand:
  imagine eager turnus not more slow,
  to rush from high on his unequal foe.

  young pallas, when he saw the chief advance
  within due distance of his flying lance,
  prepares to charge him first, resolv'd to try
  if fortune would his want of force supply;
  and thus to heav'n and hercules address'd:
  "alcides, once on earth evander's guest,
  his son adjures you by those holy rites,
  that hospitable board, those genial nights;
  assist my great attempt to gain this prize,
  and let proud turnus view, with dying eyes,
  his ravish'd spoils." 't was heard, the vain request;

hort bounds of life are set to mortal man.
  't is virtue's work alone to stretch the narrow span.
  so many sons of gods, in bloody fight,
  around the walls of troy, have lost the light:
  my own sarpedon fell beneath his foe;
  nor i, his mighty sire, could ward the blow.
  ev'n turnus shortly shall resign his breath,
  and stands already on the verge of death."
  this said, the god permits the fatal fight,
  but from the latian fields averts his sight.

  now with full force his spear young pallas threw,
  and, having thrown, his shining fauchion drew
  the steel just graz'd along the shoulder joint,
  and mark'd it slightly with the glancing point,
  fierce turnus first to nearer distance drew,
  and pois'd his pointed spear, before he threw:
  then, as the winged weapon whizz'd along,
  "see now," said he, "whose arm is better strung."
  the spear kept on the fatal course, unstay'd
  by plates of ir'n, which o'er the shield were laid:

o thy sire, at once deplor'd!
  one day first sent thee to the fighting field,
  beheld whole heaps of foes in battle kill'd;
  one day beheld thee dead, and borne upon thy shield.
  this dismal news, not from uncertain fame,
  but sad spectators, to the hero came:
  his friends upon the brink of ruin stand,
  unless reliev'd by his victorious hand.
  he whirls his sword around, without delay,
  and hews thro' adverse foes an ample way,
  to find fierce turnus, of his conquest proud:
  evander, pallas, all that friendship ow'd
  to large deserts, are present to his eyes;
  his plighted hand, and hospitable ties.

  four sons of sulmo, four whom ufens bred,
  he took in fight, and living victims led,
  to please the ghost of pallas, and expire,
  in sacrifice, before his fun'ral fire.
  at magus next he threw: he stoop'd below
  the flying spear, and shunn'd the promis'd blow;
  then, creeping, clasp'd the hero's knees, and pray'd:
  "by young iulus, by thy father's shade,
  o spare my life,

  a lofty house i have, and wealth untold,
  in silver ingots, and in bars of gold:
  all these, and sums besides, which see no day,
  the ransom of this one poor life shall pay.
  if i survive, will troy the less prevail?
  a single soul's too light to turn the scale."
  he said. the hero sternly thus replied:
  "thy bars and ingots, and the sums beside,
  leave for thy children's lot. thy turnus broke
  all rules of war by one relentless stroke,
  when pallas fell: so deems, nor deems alone
  my father's shadow, but my living son."
  thus having said, of kind remorse bereft,
  he seiz'd his helm, and dragg'd him with his left;
  then with his right hand, while his neck he wreath'd,
  up to the hilts his shining fauchion sheath'd.

  apollo's priest, emonides, was near;
  his holy fillets on his front appear;

  due to your dead companions of the war:
  the last respect the living can bestow,
  to shield their shadows from contempt below.
  that conquer'd earth be theirs, for which they fought,
  and which for us with their own blood they bought;
  but first the corpse of our unhappy friend
  to the sad city of evander send,
  who, not inglorious, in his age's bloom,
  was hurried hence by too severe a doom."

  thus, weeping while he spoke, he took his way,
  where, new in death, lamented pallas lay.
  acoetes watch'd the corpse; whose youth deserv'd
  the father's trust; and now the son he serv'd
  with equal faith, but less auspicious care.
  th' attendants of the slain his sorrow share.
  a troop of trojans mix'd with these appear,
  and mourning matrons with dishevel'd hair.
  soon as the prince appears, they raise a cry;
  all beat their breasts, and echoes rend the sky.
  they rear his drooping forehead from the ground;

  the wretched father, ere his race is run,
  shall view the fun'ral honors of his son.
  these are my triumphs of the latian war,
  fruits of my plighted faith and boasted care!
  and yet, unhappy sire, thou shalt not see
  a son whose death disgrac'd his ancestry;
  thou shalt not blush, old man, however griev'd:
  thy pallas no dishonest wound receiv'd.
  he died no death to make thee wish, too late,
  thou hadst not liv'd to see his shameful fate:
  but what a champion has th' ausonian coast,
  and what a friend hast thou, ascanius, lost!"

  thus having mourn'd, he gave the word around,
  to raise the breathless body from the ground;
  and chose a thousand horse, the flow'r of all
  his warlike troops, to wait the funeral,
  to bear him back and share evander's grief:
  a well-becoming, but a weak relief.

 pausing at ev'ry pace, in sorrow drown'd,
  betwixt their arms he sinks upon the ground;
  where grov'ling while he lies in deep despair,
  he beats his breast, and rends his hoary hair.
  the champion's chariot next is seen to roll,
  besmear'd with hostile blood, and honorably foul.
  to close the pomp, aethon, the steed of state,
  is led, the fun'rals of his lord to wait.
  stripp'd of his trappings, with a sullen pace
  he walks; and the big tears run rolling down his face.
  the lance of pallas, and the crimson crest,
  are borne behind: the victor seiz'd the rest.
  the march begins: the trumpets hoarsely sound;
  the pikes and lances trail along the ground.
  thus while the trojan and arcadian horse
  to pallantean tow'rs direct their course,
  in long procession rank'd, the pious chief
  stopp'd in the rear, and gave a vent to grief:
  "the public care," he said, "which war attends,

  to fell the timber, and forget the war.
  loud axes thro' the groaning groves resound;
  oak, mountain ash, and poplar spread the ground;
  first fall from high; and some the trunks receive

  and now the fatal news by fame is blown
  thro' the short circuit of th' arcadian town,
  of pallas slain- by fame, which just before
  his triumphs on distended pinions bore.
  rushing from out the gate, the people stand,
  each with a fun'ral flambeau in his hand.
  wildly they stare, distracted with amaze:
  the fields are lighten'd with a fiery blaze,
  that cast a sullen splendor on their friends,

  the town is fill'd with tumult and with tears,
  till the loud clamors reach evander's ears:
  forgetful of his state, he runs along,
  with a disorder'd pace, and cleaves the throng;
  falls on the corpse; and groaning there he lies,
  with silent grief, that speaks but at his eyes.
  short sighs and sobs succeed; till sorrow breaks
  a passage, and at once he weeps and speaks:

  "o pallas! thou hast fail'd thy plighted word,
  to fight with caution, not to tempt the sword!
  i warn'd thee, but in vain; for well i knew
  what perils youthful ardor would pursue,
  that boiling blood would carry thee too far,
  young as thou wert in dangers, raw to war!
  o curst essay of arms, disastrous doom,
  prelude of bloody fields, and fights to come!
  hard elements of unauspicious war,
  vain vows to heav'n, and unavailing care!

  if, for my league against th' ausonian state,

  a breathless victor, and my son had mourn'd.
  yet will i not my trojan friend upbraid,

  't was not his fault, my pallas fell so young,

  if pallas had arriv'd, with equal length
  of years, to match thy bulk with equal strength.
  but why, unhappy man, dost thou detain
  these troops, to view the tears thou shedd'st in vain?
  go, friends, this message to your lord relate:
  tell him, that, if i bear my bitter fate,
  and, after pallas' death, live ling'ring on,

  the morn had now dispell'd the shades of night,
  restoring toils, when she restor'd the light.
  the trojan king and tuscan chief command
  to raise the piles along the winding strand.
  their friends convey the dead fun'ral fires;
  black smold'ring smoke from the green wood expires;
  the light of heav'n is chok'd, and the new day retires.
  then thrice around the kindled piles they go

who, forc'd against his reason, had complied

  some help to sink new trenches; others aid
  to ram the stones, or raise the palisade.
  hoarse trumpets sound th' alarm; around the walls
  runs a distracted crew, whom their last labor calls.
  a sad procession in the streets is seen,
  of matrons, that attend the mother queen:
  high in her chair she sits, and, at her side,
  with downcast eyes, appears the fatal bride.
  they mount the cliff, where pallas' temple stands;
  pray'rs in their mouths, and presents in their hands,
  with censers first they fume the sacred shrine,
  then in this common supplication join:
  "o patroness of arms, unspotted maid,

  break short the pirate's lance; pronounce his fate,
  and lay the phrygian low before the gate."

  in deep suspense the trojan seem'd to stand,
  and, just prepar'd to strike, repress'd his hand.
  he roll'd his eyes, and ev'ry moment felt
  his manly soul with more compassion melt;
  when, casting down a casual glance, he spied
  the golden belt that glitter'd on his side,
  the fatal spoils which haughty turnus tore
  from dying pallas, and in triumph wore.
  then, rous'd anew to wrath, he loudly cries
  (flames, while he spoke, came flashing from his eyes)
  "traitor, dost thou, dost thou to grace pretend,
  clad, as thou art, in trophies of my friend?
  to his sad soul a grateful off'ring go!
  't is pallas, pallas gives this deadly blow."
  he rais'd his arm aloft, and, at the word,
  deep in his bosom drove the shining sword.
  the streaming blood distain'd his arms around,
  and the disdainful soul came rushing thro' the
