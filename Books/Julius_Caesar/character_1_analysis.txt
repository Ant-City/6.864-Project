Julius Caesar
The conspirators charge Caesar with ambition, and his
behavior substantiates this judgment: he does vie for absolute power
over Rome, reveling in the homage he receives from others and in
his conception of himself as a figure who will live on forever in
men's minds. However, his faith in his own permanence--in the sense
of both his loyalty to principles and his fixture as a public institution--eventually
proves his undoing. At first, he stubbornly refuses to heed the
nightmares of his wife, Calpurnia, and the supernatural omens pervading
the atmosphere. Though he is eventually persuaded not to go to the
Senate, Caesar ultimately lets his ambition get the better of him,
as the prospect of being crowned king proves too glorious to resist.
Caesar's conflation of his public image with
his private self helps bring about his death, since he mistakenly
believes that the immortal status granted to his public self somehow
protects his mortal body. Still, in many ways, Caesar's faith that
he is eternal proves valid by the end of the play: by Act V, scene
iii, Brutus is attributing his and Cassius's misfortunes to Caesar's
power reaching from beyond the grave. Caesar's aura
seems to affect the general outcome of events in a mystic manner, while
also inspiring Octavius and Antony and strengthening their determination.
As Octavius ultimately assumes the title Caesar, Caesar's permanence
is indeed established in some respect.
