chapter xiv

this autumn a mr. w. g. harding, of marion, ohio, was appointed
president of the united states, but zenith was less interested in the
national campaign than in the local election. seneca doane, though he
was a lawyer and a graduate of the state university, was candidate for
mayor of zenith on an alarming labor ticket. to oppose him the democrats
and republicans united on lucas prout, a mattress-manufacturer with a
perfect record for sanity. mr. prout was supported by the banks, the
chamber of commerce, all the decent newspapers, and george f. babbitt.

babbitt was precinct-leader on floral heights, but his district was safe
and he longed for stouter battling. his convention paper had given him
the beginning of a reputation for oratory, so the republican-democratic
central committee sent him to the seventh ward and south zenith, to
address small audiences of workmen and cle

ering throng, and distinguished man of affairs had pointed out the
fallacies of doane. once, in the rotogravure section of the sunday
advocate-times, there was a photograph of babbitt and a dozen other
business men, with the caption "leaders of zenith finance and commerce
who back prout."

he deserved his glory. he was an excellent campaigner. he had faith; he
was certain that if lincoln were alive, he would be electioneering for
mr. w. g. harding--unless he came to zenith and electioneered for
lucas prout. he did not confuse audiences by silly subtleties; prout
represented honest industry, seneca doane represented whining laziness,
and you could take your choice. with his broad shoulders and vigorous
voice, he was obviously a good fellow; and, rarest of all, he really
liked people. he almost liked common workmen. he wanted them to be well
paid, and able to afford high rents--though, naturally, they must
not interfere with the reasonable profits of stockholders. thus nobly
endowed, and keyed high

forth will always be a failure?"

mrs. babbitt reproved, "rone, i should think you could see and realize
that when your father's all worn out with orating, it's no time to
expect him to explain these complicated subjects. i'm sure when he's
rested he'll be glad to explain it to you. now let's all be quiet and
give papa a chance to get ready for his next speech. just think! right
now they're gathering in maccabee temple, and waiting for us!"

mr. lucas prout and sound business defeated mr. seneca doane and class
rule, and zenith was again saved. babbitt was offered several minor
appointments to distribute among poor relations, but he preferred
advance information about the extension of paved highways, and this a
grateful administration gave to him. also, he was one of only nineteen
speakers at the dinner with which the chamber of commerce celebrated the
victory of righteousness.

his reputation for oratory established, at the dinner of the zenith r

e, 'this is certainly a romantic place,' it sends a glow right
up and down your vertebrae. well, my guest to-day is from such a place,
harper's ferry, virginia, in the beautiful southland, with memories of
good old general robert e. lee and of that brave soul, john brown who,
like every good booster, goes marching on--"

there were two especially distinguished guests: the leading man of the
"bird of paradise" company, playing this week at the dodsworth theater,
and the mayor of zenith, the hon. lucas prout.

vergil gunch thundered, "when we manage to grab this celebrated thespian
off his lovely aggregation of beautiful actresses--and i got to admit
i butted right into his dressing-room and told him how the boosters
appreciated the high-class artistic performance he's giving us--and
don't forget that the treasurer of the dodsworth is a booster and will
appreciate our patronage--and when on top of that we yank hizzonor
out of his multifarious duties at city hall, then i feel we've done

that's all there is to it."

"but, my god--say, let me see the warden."

"he's busy. come on, now, you--" babbitt reared over him. the attendant
hastily changed to a coaxing "you can come back and try to-morrow.
probably the poor guy is off his nut."

babbitt drove, not at all carefully or fussily, sliding viciously past
trucks, ignoring the truckmen's curses, to the city hall; he stopped
with a grind of wheels against the curb, and ran up the marble steps to
the office of the hon. mr. lucas prout, the mayor. he bribed the mayor's
doorman with a dollar; he was instantly inside, demanding, "you remember
me, mr. prout? babbitt--vice-president of the boosters--campaigned for
you? say, have you heard about poor riesling? well, i want an order on
the warden or whatever you call um of the city prison to take me back
and see him. good. thanks."

in fifteen minutes he was pounding down the prison corridor to a cage
where paul riesling sat on a cot, twisted like an old beggar, legs
crossed, arms
