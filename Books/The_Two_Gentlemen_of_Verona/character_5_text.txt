to testifie your bounty, i thank you, you haue cestern'd me;
in requital whereof, henceforth, carry your letters your
selfe; and so sir, i'le commend you to my master

   pro. go, go, be gone, to saue your ship from wrack,
which cannot perish hauing thee aboarde,
being destin'd to a drier death on shore:
i must goe send some better messenger,
i feare my iulia would not daigne my lines,
receiuing them from such a worthlesse post.

scoena secunda.

enter iulia and lucetta.

  iul. but say lucetta (now we are alone)
would'st thou then counsaile me to fall in loue?

  luc. i madam, so you stumble not vnheedfully

   iul. of all the faire resort of gentlemen,
that euery day with par'le encounter me,
in thy opinion which is worthiest loue?

  lu. please you repeat their names, ile shew my minde,
according to my shallow simple skill

   iu. what thinkst thou of the faire sir eglamoure?
  lu. as of a knight, well-spoken, neat, and fine;

  iul. and yet i would i had ore-look'd the letter;
it were a shame to call her backe againe,
and pray her to a fault, for which i chid her.
what 'foole is she, that knowes i am a maid,
and would not force the letter to my view?
since maides, in modesty, say no, to that,
which they would haue the profferer construe, i.
fie, fie: how way-ward is this foolish loue;
that (like a testie babe) will scratch the nurse,
and presently, all humbled kisse the rod?
how churlishly, i chid lucetta hence,
when willingly, i would haue had her here?
how angerly i taught my brow to frowne,
when inward ioy enforc'd my heart to smile?
my pennance is, to call lucetta backe
and aske remission, for my folly past.
what hoe: lucetta

   lu. what would your ladiship?
  iul. is't neere dinner time?

that you might kill your stomacke on your meat,

now presently ile giue her father notice
of their disguising and pretended flight:
who (all inrag'd) will banish valentine:
for thurio he intends shall wed his daughter,
but valentine being gon, ile quickely crosse
by some slie tricke, blunt thurio's dull proceeding.

and eu'n in kinde loue, i doe coniure thee,
who art the table wherein all my thoughts
are visibly character'd, and engrau'd,
to lesson me, and tell me some good meane
how with my honour i may vndertake
a iourney to my louing protheus

   luc. alas, the way is wearisome and long

and so by many winding nookes he straies
with willing sport to the wilde ocean.
then let me goe, and hinder not my course:
ile be as patient as a gentle streame,
and make a pastime of each weary step,
till the last step haue brought me to my loue,
and there ile rest, as after much turmoile
a blessed soule doth in elizium

   luc. but in what habit will you goe along?
  iul. not like a woman, for i would preuent
the loose encounters of lasciuious men:
gentle lucetta, fit me with such weedes
as may beseeme some well reputed page

   luc. why then your ladiship must cut your haire

   iul. no girle, ile knit it vp in silken strings,
with twentie od-conceited true-loue knots:
to be fantastique, may become a youth
of greater time then i shall shew to be

   luc. what fashion (madam) shall i make your breeches?
  iul. that fits as well, as tell me (good my lord)
what compasse will you weare your farthingale?

vnlesse you haue a cod-peece to stick pins on

   iul. lucetta, as thou lou'st me let me haue
what thou think'st meet, and is most mannerly.
but tell me (wench) how will the world repute me
for vndertaking so vnstaid a iourney?
i feare me it will make me scandaliz'd

   luc. if you thinke so, then stay at home, and go not

   iul. nay, that i will not

   luc. then neuer dreame on infamy, but go:
if protheus like your iourney, when you come,
no matter who's displeas'd, when you are gone:
i feare me he will scarce be pleas'd with all

 that is the least (lucetta) of my feare:

   iul. base men, that vse them to so base effect;
but truer starres did gouerne protheus birth,
his words are bonds, his oathes are oracles,
his loue sincere, his thoughts immaculate,
his teares, pure messengers, sent from his heart,
his heart, as far from fraud, as heauen from earth
