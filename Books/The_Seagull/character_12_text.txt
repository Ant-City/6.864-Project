but do not let me stir a step from your side.

arkadina. [to herself] now he is mine! [carelessly, as if nothing unusual had happened] of course you must stay here if you really want to. i shall go, and you can follow in a week’s time. yes, really, why should you hurry away?

trigorin. let us go together.

arkadina. as you like. let us go together then. [a pause. trigorin writes something in his note-book] what are you writing?

trigorin. a happy expression i heard this morning: “a grove of maiden pines.” it may be useful. [he yawns] so we are really off again, condemned once more to railway carriages, to stations and restaurants, to hamburger steaks and endless arguments!

shamraeff comes in.

shamraeff. i am sorry to have to inform you that your carriage is at the door. it is time to start, honoured madam, the train leaves at two-five. would you be kind enough, madam, to remember to inquire for me where suzdaltzeff the actor is now? is he still alive, i wonder? is he well? he and i

n “the stolen mail.” a tragedian called izmailoff was in the same company, i remember, who was also quite remarkable. don’t hurry, madam, you still have five minutes. they were both of them conspirators once, in the same melodrama, and one night when in the course of the play they were suddenly discovered, instead of saying “we have been trapped!” izmailoff cried out: “we have been rapped!” [he laughs] rapped!

while he has been talking jacob has been busy with the trunks, and the maid has brought arkadina her hat, coat, parasol, and gloves. the cook looks hesitatingly through the door on the right, and finally comes into the room. paulina comes in. medviedenko comes in.

paulina. [presenting arkadina with a little basket] here are some plums for the journey. they are very sweet ones. you may want to nibble something good on the way.

arkadina. you are very kind, paulina.

paulina. good-bye, my dearie. if things have not been quite as you could have wished, please forgive us.

eeps.]

arkadina. it has been delightful, delightful. you mustn’t cry.

sorin comes in through the door on the left, dressed in a long coat with a cape, and carrying his hat and cane. he crosses the room.

sorin. come, sister, it is time to start, unless you want to miss the train. i am going to get into the carriage. [he goes out.]

medviedenko. i shall walk quickly to the station and see you off there. [he goes out.]

arkadina. good-bye, all! we shall meet again next summer if we live. [the maid servant, jacob, and the cook kiss her hand] don’t forget me. [she gives the cook a rouble] there is a rouble for all three of you.

the cook. thank you, mistress; a pleasant journey to you.

jacob. god bless you, mistress.

shamraeff. send us a line to cheer us up. [to trigorin] good-bye, sir.

arkadina. where is constantine? tell him i am starting. i must say good-bye to him. [to jacob] i gave the cook a rouble for all three of you.

all go out through the door on the right. the stage remain

s empty. sounds of farewell are heard. the maid comes running back to fetch the basket of plums which has been forgotten. trigorin comes back.

trigorin. i had forgotten my cane. i think i left it on the terrace. [he goes toward the door on the right and meets nina, who comes in at that moment] is that you? we are off.

nina. i knew we should meet again. [with emotion] i have come to an irrevocable decision, the die is cast: i am going on the stage. i am deserting my father and abandoning everything. i am beginning life anew. i am going, as
