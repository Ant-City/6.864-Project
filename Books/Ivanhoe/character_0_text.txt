round the hall. the brow of prince john alone was
overclouded during these discussions; some overpowering care seemed
agitating his mind, and it was only when he received occasional hints
from his attendants, that he seemed to take interest in what was passing
around him. on such occasions he would start up, quaff a cup of wine
as if to raise his spirits, and then mingle in the conversation by some
observation made abruptly or at random.

“we drink this beaker,” said he, “to the health of wilfred of ivanhoe,
champion of this passage of arms, and grieve that his wound renders him
absent from our board--let all fill to the pledge, and especially cedric
of rotherwood, the worthy father of a son so promising.”

“no, my lord,” replied cedric, standing up, and placing on the table his
untasted cup, “i yield not the name of son to the disobedient youth, who
at once despises my commands, and relinquishes the manners and customs
of his fathers.”

“‘tis impossible,” cried prince john, with w

every adherent of his brother prince john. are ye afraid of his power?”
 continued the artful confident of that prince, “we acknowledge him a
strong and valiant knight; but these are not the days of king arthur,
when a champion could encounter an army. if richard indeed comes back,
it must be alone,--unfollowed--unfriended. the bones of his gallant army
have whitened the sands of palestine. the few of his followers who have
returned have straggled hither like this wilfred of ivanhoe, beggared
and broken men.--and what talk ye of richard’s right of birth?” he
proceeded, in answer to those who objected scruples on that head. “is
richard’s title of primogeniture more decidedly certain than that of
duke robert of normandy, the conqueror’s eldest son? and yet william
the red, and henry, his second and third brothers, were successively
preferred to him by the voice of the nation, robert had every merit
which can be pleaded for richard; he was a bold knight, a good lead

felt strongly, she avowed boldly; and cedric, who could not free himself
from his habitual deference to her opinions, felt totally at a loss how
to enforce his authority of guardian.

it was in vain that he attempted to dazzle her with the prospect of a
visionary throne. rowena, who possessed strong sense, neither considered
his plan as practicable, nor as desirable, so far as she was concerned,
could it have been achieved. without attempting to conceal her avowed
preference of wilfred of ivanhoe, she declared that, were that favoured
knight out of question, she would rather take refuge in a convent, than
share a throne with athelstane, whom, having always despised, she now
began, on account of the trouble she received on his account, thoroughly
to detest.

nevertheless, cedric, whose opinions of women’s constancy was far from
strong, persisted in using every means in his power to bring about the
proposed match, in which he conceived he was rendering an important
service to the saxon

“sir knight,” replied rowena, “the grange which you contemn hath been
my shelter from infancy; and, trust me, when i leave it--should that
day ever arrive--it shall be with one who has not learnt to despise the
dwelling and manners in which i have been brought up.”

“i guess your meaning, lady,” said de bracy, “though you may think it
lies too obscure for my apprehension. but dream not, that richard coeur
de lion will ever resume his throne, far less that wilfred of ivanhoe,
his minion, will ever lead thee to his footstool, to be there welcomed
as the bride of a favourite. another suitor might feel jealousy while he
touched this string; but my firm purpose cannot be changed by a passion
so childish and so hopeless. know, lady, that this rival is in my power,
and that it rests but with me to betray the secret of his being within
the castle to front-de-boeuf, whose jealousy will be more fatal than
mine.”

“wilfred here?” said rowena, in disdain; “that is as

true as that
front-de-boeuf is his rival.”

de bracy looked at her steadily for an instant.

“wert thou really ignorant of this?” said he; “didst thou not know
that wilfred of ivanhoe travelled in the litter of the jew?--a meet
conveyance for the crusader, whose doughty arm was to reconquer the holy
sepulchre!” and he laughed scornfully.

“and if he is here,” said rowena, compelling herself to a tone of
indifference, though trembling with an agony of apprehension which she
could not suppress, “in what is he the rival of front-de-boeuf? or what
has he to fear beyond a short imprisonment, and an honourable ransom,
according to the use of chivalry?”

was residing at present, with an assurance to the hebrew to whom it
belonged, that all expenses should be duly discharged. to this, however,
rebecca opposed many reasons, of which we shall only mention two that
had peculiar weight with isaac. the one was, that she would on no
account put the phial of precious balsam into the hands of another
physician even of her own tribe, lest that valuable mystery should be
discovered; the other, that this wounded knight, wilfred of ivanhoe, was
an intimate favourite of richard coeur-de-lion, and that, in case the
monarch should return, isaac, who had supplied his brother john with
treasure to prosecute his rebellious purposes, would stand in no small
need of a powerful protector who enjoyed richard’s favour.

“thou art speaking but sooth, rebecca,” said isaac, giving way to these
weighty arguments--“it were an offending of heaven to betray the secrets
of the blessed miriam; for the good which heaven giveth, is not rashly

thy counsel, and this youth shall journey with us unto york, and our
house shall be as a home to him until his wounds shall be healed. and if
he of the lion heart shall return to the land, as is now noised abroad,

remained behind but for the curiosity of de bracy, who looked into it
under the impression that it might contain the object of his enterprise,
for rowena had not unveiled herself. but de bracy’s astonishment was
considerable, when he discovered that the litter contained a wounded
man, who, conceiving himself to have fallen into the power of saxon
outlaws, with whom his name might be a protection for himself and his
friends, frankly avowed himself to be wilfred of ivanhoe.

the ideas of chivalrous honour, which, amidst his wildness and levity,
never utterly abandoned de bracy, prohibited him from doing the knight
any injury in his defenceless condition, and equally interdicted his

to death, under any circumstances, the rival claimant of the fief of
ivanhoe. on the other hand, to liberate a suitor preferred by the lady

the black knight whispered something into the ear of the vanquished.

“i yield me to be true prisoner, rescue or no rescue,” answered the
norman, exchanging his tone of stern and determined obstinacy for one of
deep though sullen submission.

“go to the barbican,” said the victor, in a tone of authority, “and
there wait my further orders.”

“yet first, let me say,” said de bracy, “what it imports thee to know.
wilfred of ivanhoe is wounded and a prisoner, and will perish in the
burning castle without present help.”

“wilfred of ivanhoe!” exclaimed the black knight--“prisoner, and
perish!--the life of every man in the castle shall answer it if a hair
of his head be singed--show me his chamber!”

“ascend yonder winding stair,” said de bracy; “it leads to his
apartment--wilt thou not accept my guidance?” he added, in a submissive
voice.

the new comers were wilfred of ivanhoe, on the prior of botolph’s
palfrey, and gurth, who attended him, on the knight’s own war-horse.
the astonishment of ivanhoe was beyond bounds, when he saw his master
besprinkled with blood, and six or seven dead bodies lying around in
the little glade in which the battle had taken place. nor was he less
surprised to see richard surrounded by so many silvan attendants, the
outlaws, as they seemed to be, of the forest, and a perilous retinue
therefore for a prince. he hesitated whether to add

black knight-errant, or in what other manner to demean himself towards
him. richard saw his embarrassment.

“fear not, wilfred,” he said, “to address richard plantagenet as
himself, since thou seest him in the company of true english hearts,
although it may be they have been urged a few steps aside by warm
english blood.”

“sir wilfred of ivanhoe,” said the gallant outlaw, stepping forward, “my
assurances can add nothing to those of our sovereign; yet, let me say
somewhat proudly, that of men who have suffered much, he hath not truer
subjects than those who now stand around him.”

“i cannot doubt it, brave man,” said wilfred, “since thou art of the
number--but what mean these marks of death and danger? these slain men,
and the bloody armour of my prince?”

“treason hath been with us, ivanhoe,” said the king; “but, th

despite of my feeble opposition.--i dare not take the only mode to
prevent it, though thou hast placed the strong temptation within my
reach!”

“and now to my boon,” said the king, “which i ask not with one jot
the less confidence, that thou hast refused to acknowledge my lawful
sovereignty. i require of thee, as a man of thy word, on pain of being
held faithless, man-sworn, and ‘nidering’, [581] to forgive and receive
to thy paternal affection the good knight, wilfred of ivanhoe. in this
reconciliation thou wilt own i have an interest--the happiness of my
friend, and the quelling of dissension among my faithful people.”

“and this is wilfred!” said cedric, pointing to his son.

“my father!--my father!” said ivanhoe, prostrating himself at cedric’s
feet, “grant me thy forgiveness!”

“thou hast it, my son,” said cedric, raising him up. “the son of
hereward knows how to keep his word, even when it has been passed to
a norman. but let me see thee use

are still dazzled with the fasting i have undergone, i saw him stand

all now looked around and enquired for ivanhoe, but he had vanished.
it was at length discovered that a jew had been to seek him; and that,
after very brief conference, he had called for gurth and his armour, and
had left the castle.

and of honourable lineage. the temple sendeth not forth her champions
against nameless men.”

“my name,” said the knight, raising his helmet, “is better known, my
lineage more pure, malvoisin, than thine own. i am wilfred of ivanhoe.”

“i will not fight with thee at present,” said the templar, in a changed
and hollow voice. “get thy wounds healed, purvey thee a better horse,
and it may be i will hold it worth my while to scourge out of thee this
boyish spirit of bravado.”

“ha! proud templar,” said ivanhoe, “hast thou forgotten that twice didst
thou fall before this lance? remember the lists at acre--remember the
passage of arms at ashby--remember thy proud vaunt in the halls of
rotherwood, and the gage of

bois-guilbert turned his countenance irresolutely towards rebecca, and
then exclaimed, looking fiercely at ivanhoe, “dog of a saxon! take thy
lance, and prepare for the death thou hast drawn upon thee!”

 on him in astonishment, the eyes opened--but they
were fixed and glazed. the flush passed from his brow, and gave way to
the pallid hue of death. unscathed by the lance of his enemy, he had
died a victim to the violence of his own contending passions.

“this is indeed the judgment of god,” said the grand master, looking
upwards--“‘fiat voluntas tua!’”

when the first moments of surprise were over, wilfred of ivanhoe
demanded of the grand master, as judge of the field, if he had manfully
and rightfully done his duty in the combat? “manfully and rightfully hath
it been done,” said the grand master. “i pronounce the maiden free and
guiltless--the arms and the body of the deceased knight are at the will
of the victor.”

undermined,--first, by consideration of the impossibility of ridding
england of the new dynasty, a feeling which goes far to create loyalty
in the subject to the king “de facto”; and, secondly, by the personal
attention of king richard, who delighted in the blunt humour of cedric,
and, to use the language of the wardour manuscript, so dealt with the
noble saxon, that, ere he had been a guest at court for seven days, he
had given his consent to the marriage of his ward rowena and his son
wilfred of ivanhoe.

her forehead, and bending her head to the ground, in spite of rowena’s
resistance, kissed the embroidered hem of her tunic.

“what means this, lady?” said the surprised bride; “or why do you offer
to me a deference so unusual?”

“because to you, lady of ivanhoe,” said rebecca, rising up and resuming
the usual quiet dignity of her manner, “i may lawfully, and without
rebuke, pay the debt of gratitude which i owe to wilfred of ivanhoe.
i am--forgive the boldness which has offered to you the homage of my
country--i am the unhappy jewess, for whom your husband hazarded his
life against such fearful odds in the tiltyard of templestowe.”

in slight measure your unceasing charity towards him in his wounds and
misfortunes. speak, is there aught remains in which he or i can serve
