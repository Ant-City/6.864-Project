[CHARACTER] - 
                    	the
dark lord of mordor, the primary antagonist in the lord
of the rings. [CHARACTER], who created the one ring, is driven
only by his desire to retrieve the ring. he never appears during
the novel; we see only his great eye and his dark tower in mordor.
[CHARACTER]'s rule has made the land of mordor barren and inhospitable.
