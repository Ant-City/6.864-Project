at about this point, mr. gradgrindâ€™s eye would fall upon her; and under
the influence of that wintry piece of fact, she would become torpid

i entertain a weak idea that the english people are as hard-worked as any
people upon whom the sun shines.  i acknowledge to this ridiculous
idiosyncrasy, as a reason why i would give them a little more play.

of that ugly citadel, where nature was as strongly bricked out as killing
airs and gases were bricked in; at the heart of the labyrinth of narrow
courts upon courts, and close streets upon streets, which had come i

draught, were built in an immense variety of stunted and crooked shapes,
as though every house put out a sign of the kind of people who might be
expected to be born in it; among the multitude of coketown, generically
called â€˜the hands,â€™â€”a race who would have found more favour with some
people, if providence had seen fit to make them only hands, or, like the
lower creatures of the seashore, only hands and stomachsâ€”lived a certain
stephen blackpool, forty years of age.

stephen looked older, but he had had a hard life.  it is said that every
life has its roses and thorns; there seemed, however, to have been a
misadventure or mistake in stephenâ€™s case, whereby somebody else had
become possessed of his roses, and he had become possessed of the same
somebody elseâ€™s thorns in addition to his own.  he had known, to use his
words, a peck of trouble.  he was usually called old stephen, in a kind
of rough homage to the fact.

shutters, green inside blinds, a black street door, up two white steps,

brazen door-handle underneath it, like a brazen full-stop.

mr. bounderby was at his lunch.  so stephen had expected.  would his

nothing troublesome against stephen blackpool; yes, he might come in.

stately person she considered lunch a weakness.

â€˜indeed, sir?â€™ said mrs. sparsit to her chief, with great placidity.  â€˜i
inferred, from its being so miserable a marriage, that it was probably an
unequal one in point of years.â€™

mr. bounderby looked very hard at the good lady in a side-long way that
had an odd sheepishness about it.  he fortified himself with a little
more sherry.

â€˜well?  why donâ€™t you go on?â€™ he then asked, turning rather irritably on
stephen blackpool.

â€˜i haâ€™ coom to ask yo, sir, how i am to be ridded oâ€™ this woman.â€™
stephen infused a yet deeper gravity into the mixed expression of his
attentive face.  mrs. sparsit uttered a gentle ejaculation, as having
received a moral shock.

â€˜what do you mean?â€™ said bounderby, getting up to lean his back against
the chimney-piece.  â€˜what are you talking about?  you took her for better

newly come from a journey.  the flutter of her manner, in the unwonted
noise of the streets; the spare shawl, carried unfolded on her arm; the
heavy umbrella, and little basket; the loose long-fingered gloves, to
which her hands were unused; all bespoke an old woman from the country,
in her plain holiday clothes, come into coketown on an expedition of rare
occurrence.  remarking this at a glance, with the quick observation of
his class, stephen blackpool bent his attentive faceâ€”his face, which,
like the faces of many of his order, by dint of long working with eyes
and hands in the midst of a prodigious noise, had acquired the
concentrated look with which we are familiar in the countenances of the
deafâ€”the better to hear what she asked him.

t the oratorâ€™s side before the concourse.  he was pale
and a little moved in the faceâ€”his lips especially showed it; but he
stood quiet, with his left hand at his chin, waiting to be heard.  there
was a chairman to regulate the proceedings, and this functionary now took
the case into his own hands.

â€˜my friends,â€™ said he, â€˜by virtue oâ€™ my office as your president, i askes
oâ€™ our friend slackbridge, who may be a little over hetter in this
business, to take his seat, whiles this man stephen blackpool is heern.
you all know this man stephen blackpool.  you know him awlung oâ€™ his
misfortâ€™ns, and his good name.â€™

with that, the chairman shook him frankly by the hand, and sat down
again.  slackbridge likewise sat down, wiping his hot foreheadâ€”always
from left to right, and never the reverse way.

â€˜my friends,â€™ stephen began, in the midst of a dead calm; â€˜i haâ€™ hed

â€˜stephen blackpool,â€™ said the chairman, rising, â€˜think on â€™t agen.  think
on â€™t once agen, lad, afore thouâ€™rt shunned by aw owd friends.â€™

there was an universal murmur to the same effect, though no man
articulated a word.  every eye was fixed on stephenâ€™s face.  to repent of
his determination, would be to take a load from all their minds.  he
looked around him, and knew that it was so.  not a grain of anger with
them was in his heart; he knew them, far below their surface weaknesses

doubtful faces (a little conscience-stricken) brightened at the sound,
and took it up.  private feeling must yield to the common cause.  hurrah!
the roof yet vibrated with the cheering, when the assembly dispersed.

thus easily did stephen blackpool fall into the loneliest of lives, the
life of solitude among a familiar crowd.  the stranger in the land who
looks into ten thousand faces for some answering look and never finds it,
is in cheering society as compared with him who passes ten averted faces
daily, that were once the countenances of friends.  such experience was
to be stephenâ€™s now, in every waking moment of his life; at his work, on
his way to it and from it, at his door, at his window, everywhere.  by

er the four days he had passed, this address fell rudely and
discordantly on stephenâ€™s ear.  besides being a rough handling of his
wounded mind, it seemed to assume that he really was the self-interested
deserter he had been called.

â€˜why, i have told you,â€™ returned bounderby.  â€˜speak up like a man, since
you are a man, and tell us about yourself and this combination.â€™

mr. bounderby, who was always more or less like a wind, finding something
in his way here, began to blow at it directly.

â€˜now, look here, harthouse,â€™ said he, â€˜hereâ€™s a specimen of â€™em.  when
this man was here once before, i warned this man against the mischievous
strangers who are always aboutâ€”and who ought to be hanged wherever they

did you ever meet with anything like that man out of this blessed
country?â€™  and mr. bounderby pointed him out for inspection, with an
angry finger.

â€˜nay, maâ€™am,â€™ said stephen blackpool, staunchly protesting against the
words that had been used, and instinctively addressing himself to louisa,
after glancing at her face.  â€˜not rebels, nor yet rascals.  nowt oâ€™ thâ€™

â€˜i have already said, i fear louisa has not been understood.  is it

mr. bounderby may have been annoyed by the repetition of his own words to

â€˜i was merely going on to remark, bounderby, that we may all be more or

part, remembering the trust you have accepted, may not only be an act of

they were at fault too, and off the scent.  although they had been so
quiet since the first outbreak of the matter, that most people really did
suppose it to have been abandoned as hopeless, nothing new occurred.  no
implicated man or woman took untimely courage, or made a self-betraying
step.  more remarkable yet, stephen blackpool could not be heard of, and
the mysterious old woman remained a mystery.

things having come to this pass, and showing no latent signs of stirring
beyond it, the upshot of mr. bounderbyâ€™s investigations was, that he
resolved to hazard a bold burst.  he drew up a placard, offering twenty
pounds reward for the apprehension of stephen blackpool, suspected of
complicity in the robbery of coketown bank on such a night; he described
the said stephen blackpool by dress, complexion, estimated height,

ridiculous and improbable account was true or not, i am bound to say itâ€™s

 night, when sissy returned home and told louisa that stephen was not
come, she told it in a whisper.  next night again, when she came home
with the same account, and added that he had not been heard of, she spoke
in the same low frightened tone.  from the moment of that interchange of
looks, they never uttered his name, or any reference to him, aloud; nor
ever pursued the subject of the robbery, when mr. gradgrind spoke of it.

the two appointed days ran out, three days and nights ran out, and
stephen blackpool was not come, and remained unheard of.  on the fourth
day, rachael, with unabated confidence, but considering her despatch to
have miscarried, went up to the bank, and showed her letter from him with
his address, at a working colony, one of many, not upon the main road,
sixty miles away.  messengers were sent to that place, and the whole town
looked for stephen to be brought in next day.

edings.  he was greatly excited,
horribly fevered, bit his nails down to the quick, spoke in a hard
rattling voice, and with lips that were black and burnt up.  at the hour
when the suspected man was looked for, the whelp was at the station;
offering to wager that he had made off before the arrival of those who
were sent in quest of him, and that he would not appear.

the whelp was right.  the messengers returned alone.  rachaelâ€™s letter
had gone, rachaelâ€™s letter had been delivered.  stephen blackpool had
decamped in that same hour; and no soul knew more of him.  the only doubt
in coketown was, whether rachael had written in good faith, believing
that he really would come back, or warning him to fly.  on this point
opinion was divided.

six days, seven days, far on into another week.  the wretched whelp
plucked up a ghastly courage, and began to grow defiant.  â€˜_was_ the

e shorn and forlorn, if he had had his ears cropped.  even that
unlucky female, mrs. sparsit, fallen from her pinnacle of exultation into
the slough of despond, was not in so bad a plight as that remarkable man
and self-made humbug, josiah bounderby of coketown.

rachael and sissy, leaving mrs. pegler to occupy a bed at her sonâ€™s for
that night, walked together to the gate of stone lodge and there parted.
mr. gradgrind joined them before they had gone very far, and spoke with
much interest of stephen blackpool; for whom he thought this signal
failure of the suspicions against mrs. pegler was likely to work well.

as to the whelp; throughout this scene as on all other late occasions, he
had stuck close to bounderby.  he seemed to feel that as long as
bounderby could make no discovery without his knowledge, he was so far
safe.  he never visited his sister, and had only seen her once since she
went home: that is to say on the night when he still stuck close to
bounderby, as already related.

 connexion with the robbery,
she and sissy had held no confidence on the subject, save in that one
interchange of looks when the unconscious father rested his gray head on
his hand; but it was understood between them, and they both knew it.
this other fear was so awful, that it hovered about each of them like a
ghostly shadow; neither daring to think of its being near herself, far
less of its being near the other.

and still the forced spirit which the whelp had plucked up, throve with
him.  if stephen blackpool was not the thief, let him show himself.  why
didnâ€™t he?

another night.  another day and night.  no stephen blackpool.  where was
the man, and why did he not come back?

the starlight


the sunday was a bright sunday in autumn, clear and cool, when early in
the morning sissy and rachael met, to walk in the country.

i donâ€™t know.  this has not been broken very long.  the wood is quite
fresh where it gave way.  here are footsteps too.â€”o rachael!â€™

she ran back, and caught her round the neck.  rachael had already started
up.

â€˜what is the matter?â€™

â€˜i donâ€™t know.  there is a hat lying in the grass.â€™  they went forward
together.  rachael took it up, shaking from head to foot.  she broke into
a passion of tears and lamentations: stephen blackpool was written in his
own hand on the inside.

â€˜o the poor lad, the poor lad!  he has been made away with.  he is lying
murdered here!â€™

â€˜is thereâ€”has the hat any blood upon it?â€™ sissy faltered.

they were afraid to look; but they did examine it, and found no mark of
violence, inside or out.  it had been lying there some days, for rain and
dew had stained it, and the mark of its shape was on the grass where it
had fallen.  they looked fearfully about them, without moving, but could

mr. gradgrind turned away, and said no more.

in the morning, he went down to the bank himself as soon as it was
opened, and seeing his sonâ€™s place empty (he had not the courage to look
in at first) went back along the street to meet mr. bounderby on his way
there.  to whom he said that, for reasons he would soon explain, but
entreated not then to be asked for, he had found it necessary to employ
his son at a distance for a little while.  also, that he was charged with
the duty of vindicating stephen blackpoolâ€™s memory, and declaring the
thief.  mr. bounderby quite confounded, stood stock-still in the street
after his father-in-law had left him, swelling like an immense
soap-bubble, without its beauty.

mr. gradgrind went home, locked himself in his room, and kept it all that
day.  when sissy and louisa tapped at his door, he said, without opening
it, â€˜not now, my dears; in the evening.â€™  on their return in the evening,
he said, â€˜i am not able yetâ€”to-morrow.â€™  he ate nothing all day, and

â€˜he took him out of the room.  i asked him afterwards, why he had done
so, and he made a plausible excuse; but since last night, father, and
when i remember the circumstances by its light, i am afraid i can imagine
too truly what passed between them.â€™

â€˜let me know,â€™ said her father, â€˜if your thoughts present your guilty
brother in the same dark view as mine.â€™

â€˜i fear, father,â€™ hesitated louisa, â€˜that he must have made some
representation to stephen blackpoolâ€”perhaps in my name, perhaps in his
ownâ€”which induced him to do in good faith and honesty, what he had never
done before, and to wait about the bank those two or three nights before
he left the town.â€™

â€˜too plain!â€™ returned the father.  â€˜too plain!â€™

he shaded his face, and remained silent for some moments.  recovering
himself, he said:

â€˜and now, how is he to be found?  how is he to be saved from justice?  in
the few hours that i can possibly allow to elapse before i publish the

here was louisa on the night of the same day, watching the fire as in
days of yore, though with a gentler and a humbler face.  how much of the
future might arise before _her_ vision?  broadsides in the streets,
signed with her fatherâ€™s name, exonerating the late stephen blackpool,
weaver, from misplaced suspicion, and publishing the guilt of his own
son, with such extenuation as his years and temptation (he could not
bring himself to add, his education) might beseech; were of the present.
so, stephen blackpoolâ€™s tombstone, with her fatherâ€™s record of his death,
was almost of the present, for she knew it was to be.  these things she
could plainly see.  but, how much of the future?
