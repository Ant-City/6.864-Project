[CHARACTER] - 
 [CHARACTER]s are the objects that we experience
all around us--trees, flowers, chairs--any physical objects. they
are "sensible" because we can sense them with our sight, smell,
hearing, taste, and touch; they are "particular," because they are particular
items that undergo change over time, rather than universal, unchanging
ideas. according to plato's metaphysical picture, the visible realm
is made up of [CHARACTER]s. according to his epistemological picture,
[CHARACTER]s cannot be objects of knowledge but only of
opinion.
