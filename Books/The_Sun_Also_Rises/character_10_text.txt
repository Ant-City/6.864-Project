"you neither."

"it isn't bad here," she said. "it isn't chic, but the food is all right."
"better than you eat in liege."
"brussels, you mean."
we had another bottle of wine and georgette made a joke. she smiled and showed all her bad teeth, and we

"what are you called?"
"georgette. how are you called?"
"jacob."
"that's a flemish name."
"american too."
"you're not flamand?"
"no, american."
"good, i detest flamands."
by this time we were at the restaurant. i called to the _cocher_ to stop. we got out and georgette did not like

"why, the dancings. don't you know we've revived them?" mrs. braddocks put in.
"you must come, jake. we're all going," frances said from the end of the table. she was tall and had a smile.
"of course, he's coming," braddocks said. "come in and have coffee with us, barnes."
"right."
"and  bring  your  friend,"  said  mrs.  braddocks  laughing.  she  was  a  canadian  and  had  all  their  easy  social

"thanks, we'll be in," i said. i went back to the small room.
"who are your friends?" georgette asked.
"writers and artists."
"there are lots of those on this side of the river."
"too many."
"i think so. still, some of them make money."
"oh, yes."



we finished the meal and the wine. "come on," i said. "we're going to have coffee with the others."
georgette opened her bag, made a few passes at her face as she looked in the little mirror, re-defined her lips



"good," she said.
we went into the room full of people and braddocks and the men at his table stood up.

"connais pas," georgette answered.
"but you have the same name," mrs. braddocks insisted cordially.
"no," said georgette. "not at all. my name is hobin."

we came off the floor perspiring.


"no, i don't like paris. it's expensive and dirty."
"really? i find it so extraordinarily clean. one of the cleanest cities in all europe."
"i find it dirty."
"how strange! but perhaps you have not been here very long."
"i've been here long enough."

georgette turned to me. "you have nice friends."

"that's a good idea."


some one asked georgette to dance, and i went over to the bar. it was really very hot and the accordion music
was pleasant in the hot night. i drank a beer, standing in the doorway and getting the cool breath of wind from the
street. two taxis were coming down the steep street. they both stopped in front of the bal. a crowd of young men,
some in jerseys and some in their shirt-sleeves, got out. i could see their hands and newly washed, wavy hair in the
light from the door. the policeman standing by the door looked at m

i was very angry. somehow they always made me angry. i know they are supposed to be amusing, and you
should be tolerant, but i wanted to swing on one, any one, anything to shatter that superior, simpering composure.
instead, i walked down the street and had a beer at the bar at the next bal. the beer was not good and i had a worse
cognac  to  take  the  taste  out  of  my  mouth.  when  i  came  back  to  the  bad  there  was  a  crowd  on  the  floor  and
georgette was dancing with the tall blond youth, who danced big-hippily, carrying his head on one side, his eyes
lifted as he danced. as soon as the music stopped another one of them asked her to dance. she had been taken up by
them. i knew then that they would all dance with her. they are like that.
i sat down at a table. cohn was sitting there. frances was dancing. mrs. braddocks brought up somebody and

introduced him as robert prentiss. he was from new york by way of chicago, and was a rising new nov

i was a little drunk. not drunk in any positive sense but just enough to be careless.
"for god's sake," i said, "yes. don't you?"
"oh, how charmingly you get angry," he said. "i wish i had that faculty."
i  got  up  and  walked  over  toward  the  dancing-floor.  mrs.  braddocks  followed  me.  "don't  be  cross  with

"isn't she?" i said.
"rather," said mrs. braddocks.



"it's a fine crowd you're with, brett," i said.
"aren't they lovely? and you, my dear. where did you get it?"
"at the napolitain."
"and have you had a lovely evening?"
"oh, priceless," i said.
brett laughed. "it's wrong of you, jake. it's an insult to all of us. look at frances there, and jo."
this for cohn's benefit.
"it's in restraint of trade," brett said. she laughed again.
"you're wonderfully sober," i said.

must have looked when he saw the promised land. cohn, of course, was much younger. but he had that look of
eager, deserving expectation.

brett  was  damned  good-looking.  she  wore  a  slipover  jersey  sweater  and  a  tweed  skirt,  and  her  hair  was

missed none of it with that wool jersey.

"how about the next?" asked cohn.
"we're going," brett said. "we've a date up at montmartre."
dancing, i looked over brett's shoulder and saw cohn, standing at the bar, still watching her.
"you've made a new one there," i said to her.
"don't talk about it. poor chap. i never knew it till just now."
"oh, well," i said. "i suppose you like to add them up."
