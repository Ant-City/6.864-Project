 on
seeing him remark upon his likeness to gilgamesh. he is the very
counterpart of the latter, though somewhat smaller in stature. there
follows the encounter between the two heroes in the streets of erech,
where they engage in a fierce combat. gilgamesh is overcome by enkidu
and is enraged at being thrown to the ground. the tablet closes with
the endeavor of enkidu to pacify gilgamesh. enkidu declares that the
mother of gilgamesh has exalted her son above the ordinary mortal,
and that enlil himself has singled him out for royal prerogatives.

after this, we may assume, the two heroes become friends and together
proceed to carry out certain exploits, the first of which is an attack
upon the mighty guardian of the cedar forest. this is the main episode
in the yale tablet, which, therefore, forms the third tablet of the
old babylonian version.

in the first column of the obverse of the yale tablet, which is badly
preserved, it would appear that the elders of erech (or perhap

commentary on the pennsylvania tablet.


line 1. the verb _tibû_ with _pasâru_ expresses the aim of gish to
secure an interpretation for his dream. this disposes of langdon's
note 1 on page 211 of his edition, in which he also erroneously speaks
of our text as "late." _pasâru_ is not a variant of _zakâru_. both
verbs occur just as here in the assyrian version i, 5, 25.

line 3. _ina

 "husband," but "man" in general. see
above note to line 107. langdon's strange misreading _ri-es-su_ for
_ri-es-ka_ ("thy head") leads him again to miss the point, namely
that enkidu comforts his rival by telling him that he is destined for
a career above that of the ordinary man. he is to be more than a mere
prize fighter; he is to be a king, and no doubt in the ancient sense,
as the representative of the deity. this is indicated by the statement
that the kingship is decreed for him by enlil. similarly, hu(m)baba or
huwawa is designated by enlil to inspire terror among men (assyrian
version, tablet iv, 5, 2 and 5), _i-sim-sú d_enlil = yale tablet,
l. 137, where this is to be supplied. this position accorded to enlil
is an important index for the origin of the epic, which is thus shown
to date from a period when the patron deity of nippur was acknowledged
as the general head of the pantheon. this justifies us in going back
several centuries at least before hammurabi for the

the gilgamesh story. if it had originated in the hammurabi period,
we should have had marduk introduced instead of enlil.

line 242. as has been pointed out in the corrections to the text
(appendix), _sú-tu-ur_ can only be iii, 1, from _atâru_, "to be in
excess of." it is a pity that the balance of the line is broken off,
since this is the first instance of a colophon beginning with the
term in question. in some way _sutûr_ must indicate that the copy of
the text has been "enlarged." it is tempting to fill out the line
_sú-tu-ur e-li [duppi labiri]_, and to render "enlarged from an
original," as an i
