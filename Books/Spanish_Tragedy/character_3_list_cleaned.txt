[CHARACTER] - 
      the prince of portugal and son of the portuguese viceroy. [CHARACTER] is characterized by his extreme pride and his hot-headedness. this pride makes him kill horatio along with lorenzo, and it turns him into a villain. he kills andrea fairly, though with help, so it is unclear whether he is as "valiant" as the king and others continuously describe him. but his love for bel-imperia is genuine, and it is this love that primarily motivates his killing of horatio.
