The Son  - 
      A tall, severe man of twenty-two. The Son appears contemptuous, supercilious, and humiliated by the other Characters. Having been grown up in the country, he is estranged from his family and, in his aloofness, will cause the elimination of the step-children within the Characters' drama. Ironically, he ultimately appear as witness to the two younger children's demise. His role as a character is his ashamed refusal to participate in the spectacle. He protests to the Manager that he is an unrealized character.
