treasure island


part one--the old buccaneer

the old sea-dog at the admiral benbow


squire trelawney, dr. livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen having
asked me to write down the whole particulars about treasure island, from
the beginning to the end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the
island, and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted, i
take up my pen in the year of grace 17__ and go back to the time when
my father kept the admiral benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the
sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof.

i remember him as if it were yesterday, as he ca

was a great annoyance when it blew. i remember the appearance of his
coat, which he patched himself upstairs in his room, and which, before
the end, was nothing but patches. he never wrote or received a letter,
and he never spoke with any but the neighbours, and with these, for the
most part, only when drunk on rum. the great sea-chest none of us had
ever seen open.

he was only once crossed, and that was towards the end, when my poor
father was far gone in a decline that took him off. dr. livesey came
late one afternoon to see the patient, took a bit of dinner from my
mother, and went into the parlour to smoke a pipe until his horse should
come down from the hamlet, for we had no stabling at the old benbow. i
followed him in, and i remember observing the contrast the neat, bright
doctor, with his powder as white as snow and his bright, black eyes and
pleasant manners, made with the coltish country folk, and above all,
with that filthy, heavy, bleared scarecrow of a pirate of ours, sitti

           drink and the devil had done for the rest--
             yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!"

at first i had supposed "the dead man's chest" to be that identical big
box of his upstairs in the front room, and the thought had been mingled
in my nightmares with that of the one-legged seafaring man. but by this
time we had all long ceased to pay any particular notice to the song; it
was new, that night, to nobody but dr. livesey, and on him i observed it
did not produce an agreeable effect, for he looked up for a moment quite
angrily before he went on with his talk to old taylor, the gardener, on
a new cure for the rheumatics. in the meantime, the captain gradually
brightened up at his own music, and at last flapped his hand upon
the table before him in a way we all knew to mean silence. the voices
stopped at once, all but dr. livesey's; he went on as before speaking
clear and kind and drawing briskly at his pipe betwe

knuckled under, put up his weapon, and resumed his seat, grumbling like
a beaten dog.

"and now, sir," continued the doctor, "since i now know there's such a
fellow in my district, you may count i'll have an eye upon you day and
night. i'm not a doctor only; i'm a magistrate; and if i catch a breath
of complaint against you, if it's only for a piece of incivility like
tonight's, i'll take effectual means to have you hunted down and routed
out of this. let that suffice."

soon after, dr. livesey's horse came to the door and he rode away, but
the captain held his peace that evening, and for many evenings to come.

black dog appears and disappears


it was not very long after this that there occurred the first of the
mysterious events that rid us at last of the captain, though not, as you
will see, of his affairs. it was a bitter cold winter, with long, hard
frosts and heavy gales; and it was plain from the first that my poor
father was little likely to see the spring. he sank dail

the sun still low and only touching the hilltops and shining far to
seaward. the captain had risen earlier than usual and set out down the
beach, his cutlass swinging under the broad skirts of the old blue coat,
his brass telescope under his arm, his hat tilted back upon his head. i
remember his breath hanging like smoke in his wake as he strode off, and
the last sound i heard of him as he turned the big rock was a loud snort
of indignation, as though his mind was still running upon dr. livesey.

well, mother was upstairs with father and i was laying the
breakfast-table against the captain's return when the parlour door
opened and a man stepped in on whom i had never set my eyes before. he
was a pale, tallowy creature, wanting two fingers of the left hand, and
though he wore a cutlass, he did not look much like a fighter. i
had always my eye open for seafaring men, with one leg or two, and i
remember this one puzzled me. he was not sailorly, and yet he had a
smack of the sea about him

, but his eyes were closed and his face a horrible
colour.

"dear, deary me," cried my mother, "what a disgrace upon the house! and
your poor father sick!"

in the meantime, we had no idea what to do to help the captain, nor any
other thought but that he had got his death-hurt in the scuffle with
the stranger. i got the rum, to be sure, and tried to put it down his
throat, but his teeth were tightly shut and his jaws as strong as iron.
it was a happy relief for us when the door opened and doctor livesey
came in, on his visit to my father.

"oh, doctor," we cried, "what shall we do? where is he wounded?"

"wounded? a fiddle-stick's end!" said the doctor. "no more wounded than
you or i. the man has had a stroke, as i warned him. now, mrs. hawkins,
just you run upstairs to your husband and tell him, if possible, nothing
about it. for my part, i must do my best to save this fellow's trebly
worthless life; jim, you get me a basin."

when i got back with the basin, the doctor had already ripped up t

 lost no time, of course, in telling my mother all that i knew, and
perhaps should have told her long before, and we saw ourselves at once
in a difficult and dangerous position. some of the man's money--if
he had any--was certainly due to us, but it was not likely that our
captain's shipmates, above all the two specimens seen by me, black
dog and the blind beggar, would be inclined to give up their booty in
payment of the dead man's debts. the captain's order to mount at
once and ride for doctor livesey would have left my mother alone
and unprotected, which was not to be thought of. indeed, it seemed
impossible for either of us to remain much longer in the house; the fall
of coals in the kitchen grate, the very ticking of the clock, filled
us with alarms. the neighbourhood, to our ears, seemed haunted by
approaching footsteps; and what between the dead body of the captain
on the parlour floor and the thought of that detestable blind beggar
hovering near at hand and ready to return, there were

ht of terror. some of the men who
had been to field-work on the far side of the admiral benbow remembered,
besides, to have seen several strangers on the road, and taking them to
be smugglers, to have bolted away; and one at least had seen a little
lugger in what we called kitt's hole. for that matter, anyone who was a
comrade of the captain's was enough to frighten them to death. and the
short and the long of the matter was, that while we could get several
who were willing enough to ride to dr. livesey's, which lay in another
direction, not one would help us to defend the inn.

they say cowardice is infectious; but then argument is, on the other
hand, a great emboldener; and so when each had said his say, my mother
made them a speech. she would not, she declared, lose money that
belonged to her fatherless boy; "if none of the rest of you dare,"
she said, "jim and i dare. back we will go, the way we came, and small
thanks to you big, hulking, chicken-hearted men. we'll have that chest

the rider tried to save him, but in vain. down went pew with a cry that
rang high into the night; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him
and passed by. he fell on his side, then gently collapsed upon his face
and moved no more.

i leaped to my feet and hailed the riders. they were pulling up, at any
rate, horrified at the accident; and i soon saw what they were. one,
tailing out behind the rest, was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to
dr. livesey's; the rest were revenue officers, whom he had met by the
way, and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once. some
news of the lugger in kitt's hole had found its way to supervisor dance
and set him forth that night in our direction, and to that circumstance
my mother and i owed our preservation from death.

to the hamlet, a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her

were ruined. mr. dance could make nothing of the scene.

"they got the money, you say? well, then, hawkins, what in fortune were
they after? more money, i suppose?"

"no, sir; not money, i think," replied i. "in fact, sir, i believe i
have the thing in my breast pocket; and to tell you the truth, i should
like to get it put in safety."

"to be sure, boy; quite right," said he. "i'll take it, if you like."

"i thought perhaps dr. livesey--" i began.

"perfectly right," he interrupted very cheerily, "perfectly right--a
gentleman and a magistrate. and, now i come to think of it, i might as
well ride round there myself and report to him or squire. master pew's
dead, when all's done; not that i regret it, but he's dead, you see, and
people will make it out against an officer of his majesty's revenue,
if make it out they can. now, i'll tell you, hawkins, if you like, i'll
take you along."

i thanked him heartily for the offer, and w

e walked back to the hamlet
where the horses were. by the time i had told mother of my purpose they
were all in the saddle.

"dogger," said mr. dance, "you have a good horse; take up this lad
behind you."

as soon as i was mounted, holding on to dogger's belt, the supervisor
gave the word, and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road
to dr. livesey's house.

the captain's papers

we rode hard all the way till we drew up before dr. livesey's door. the
house was all dark to the front.

mr. dance told me to jump down and knock, and dogger gave me a stirrup
to descend by. the door was opened almost at once by the maid.

"is dr. livesey in?" i asked.

no, she said, he had come home in the afternoon but had gone up to the
hall to dine and pass the evening with the squire.

"so there we go, boys," said mr. dance.

this time, as the distance was short, i did not mount, but ran with
dogger's stirrup-leather to the lodge gates and up the

long, leafless,
moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall buildings looked on
either hand on great old gardens. here mr. dance dismounted, and taking
me along with him, was admitted at a word into the house.

the servant led us down a matted passage and showed us at the end into a
great library, all lined with bookcases and busts upon the top of them,
where the squire and dr. livesey sat, pipe in hand, on either side of a
bright fire.

i had never seen the squire so near at hand. he was a tall man, over six
feet high, and broad in proportion, and he had a bluff, rough-and-ready
face, all roughened and reddened and lined in his long travels. his
eyebrows were very black, and moved readily, and this gave him a look of
some temper, not bad, you would say, but quick and high.

"come in, mr. dance," says he, very stately and condescending.

"good evening, dance," says the doctor

 that they were
after, have you?"

"here it is, sir," said i, and gave him the oilskin packet.

the doctor looked it all over, as if his fingers were itching to open
it; but instead of doing that, he put it quietly in the pocket of his
coat.

"squire," said he, "when dance has had his ale he must, of course, be
off on his majesty's service; but i mean to keep jim hawkins here to
sleep at my house, and with your permission, i propose we should have up
the cold pie and let him sup."

"as you will, livesey," said the squire; "hawkins has earned better than
cold pie."

so a big pigeon pie was brought in and put on a sidetable, and i made
a hearty supper, for i was as hungry as a hawk, while mr. dance was
further complimented and at last dismissed.

"and now, squire," said the doctor.

"and now, livesey," said the squire in the same breath.

"one at a time, one at a time," laughed dr. livesey. "you have heard of
this flint, i suppose?"

"heard of him!" cried the squire. "heard of him, you say! he w

along, and i'll have that treasure if i search a year."

"very well," said the doctor. "now, then, if jim is agreeable, we'll
open the packet"; and he laid it before him on the table.

the bundle was sewn together, and the doctor had to get out his
instrument case and cut the stitches with his medical scissors. it
contained two things--a book and a sealed paper.

"first of all we'll try the book," observed the doctor.

the squire and i were both peering over his shoulder as he opened
it, for dr. livesey had kindly motioned me to come round from the
side-table, where i had been eating, to enjoy the sport of the search.
on the first page there were only some scraps of writing, such as a man
with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice. one was the
same as the tattoo mark, "billy bones his fancy"; then there was "mr. w.
bones, mate," "no more rum," "off palm key he got itt," and some other
snatches, mostly single words and unintelligible. i could not help
wondering who it was that h

a knife in his back as like as not.

"not much instruction there," said dr. livesey as he passed on.

the next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious series of
entries. there was a date at one end of the line and at the other a
sum of money, as in common account-books, but instead of explanatory
writing, only a varying number of crosses between the two. on the 12th
of june, 1745, for instance, a sum of seventy pounds had plainly become
due to someone, and there was nothing but six crosses to explain the
cause. in a few cases, to be sure, the name of a place would be ad

ded,
as "offe caraccas," or a mere entry of latitude and longitude, as "62o
17' 20", 19o 2' 40"."

the record lasted over nearly twenty years, the amount of the separate
entries growing larger as time went on, and at the end a grand total
had been made out after five or six wrong additions, and these words
appended, "bones, his pile."

"i can't make head or tail of this," said dr. livesey.

"the thing is as clear as noonday," cried the squire. "this is the
black-hearted hound's account-book. these crosses stand for the names of
ships or towns that they sank or plundered. the sums are the scoundrel's
share, and where he feared an ambiguity, you see he added something
clearer. 'offe caraccas,' now; you see, here was some unhappy vessel
boarded off that coast. god help the poor souls that manned her--coral
long ago."

"right!" said the doctor. "see what it is to be a traveller. rig

that was all; but brief as it was, and to me incomprehensible, it filled

part two--the sea-cook

i go to bristol

it was longer than the squire imagined ere we were ready for the sea,
and none of our first plans--not even dr. livesey's, of keeping me
beside him--could be carried out as we intended. the doctor had to go
to london for a physician to take charge of his practice; the squire was
hard at work at bristol; and i lived on at the hall under the charge of
old redruth, the gamekeeper, almost a prisoner, but full of sea-dreams
and the most charming anticipations of strange islands and adventures.
i brooded by the hour together over the map, all the details of which
i well remembered. sitting by the fire in the housekeep

ancy from every possible direction; i
explored every acre of its surface; i climbed a thousand times to that
tall hill they call the spy-glass, and from the top enjoyed the most
wonderful and changing prospects. sometimes the isle was thick with
savages, with whom we fought, sometimes full of dangerous animals that
hunted us, but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange and
tragic as our actual adventures.

so the weeks passed on, till one fine day there came a letter addressed
to dr. livesey, with this addition, "to be opened, in the case of his
absence, by tom redruth or young hawkins." obeying this order, we
found, or rather i found--for the gamekeeper was a poor hand at reading
anything but print--the following important news:

     old anchor inn, bristol, march 1, 17--

     dear livesey--as i do not know whether you
     are at the hall or still in london, i send this in
     double to both places.

     the ship is bought and fitted.  she lies at
     anchor, ready for sea.

 you never imagined a
     sweeter schooner--a child might sail her--two
     hundred tons; name, hispaniola.

     i got her through my old friend, blandly, who
     has proved himself throughout the most surprising
     trump.  the admirable fellow literally slaved in
     my interest, and so, i may say, did everyone in
     bristol, as soon as they got wind of the port we
     sailed for--treasure, i mean.

"redruth," said i, interrupting the letter, "dr. livesey will not like
that. the squire has been talking, after all."

"well, who's a better right?" growled the gamekeeper. "a pretty rum go
if squire ain't to talk for dr. livesey, i should think."

at that i gave up all attempts at commentary and read straight on:

     blandly himself found the hispaniola, and
     by the most admirable management got her for the
     merest trifle.  there is a class of men in bristol
     monstrously prejudiced against blandly.  they go

     get to sea again.  he had hobbled down there that
     morning, he said, to get a smell of the salt.

     i was monstrously touched--so would you have
     been--and, out of pure pity, i engaged him on the
     spot to be ship's cook.  long john silver, he is
     called, and has lost a leg; but that i regarded as
     a recommendation, since he lost it in his
     country's service, under the immortal hawke.  he
     has no pension, livesey.  imagine the abominable
     age we live in!

     well, sir, i thought i had only found a cook,
     but it was a crew i had discovered.  between
     silver and myself we got together in a few days a
     company of the toughest old salts imaginable--not
     pretty to look at, but fellows, by their faces, of
     the most indomitable spirit.  i declare we could
     fight a frigate.

     long john even got rid of two out of the six
     or seven i had already engaged.  he showed me in a

     swabs we had to fear in an adventure of

     ho!  hang the treasure!  it's the glory of the sea
     that has turned my head.  so now, livesey, come

     mother, with redruth for a guard; and then both
     come full speed to bristol.

companion, telling me about the different ships that we passed by,
their rig, tonnage, and nationality, explaining the work that was going
forward--how one was discharging, another taking in cargo, and a third
making ready for sea--and every now and then telling me some little
anecdote of ships or seamen or repeating a nautical phrase till i had
learned it perfectly. i began to see that here was one of the best of
possible shipmates.

when we got to the inn, the squire and dr. livesey were seated together,
finishing a quart of ale with a toast in it, before they should go
aboard the schooner on a visit of inspection.

long john told the story from first to last, with a great deal of spirit
and the most perfect truth. "that was how it were, now, weren't it,
hawkins?" he would say, now and again, and i could always bear him
entirely out.

the two gentlemen regretted that black dog had got away, but we all
agreed there was nothing to be done, and after he had been complimented,

"aye, aye, sir," cried the cook, in the passage.

"well, squire," said dr. livesey, "i don't put much faith in your
discoveries, as a general thing; but i will say this, john silver suits
me."

"the man's a perfect trump," declared the squire.

"and now," added the doctor, "jim may come on board with us, may he
not?"

"to be sure he may," says squire. "take your hat, hawkins, and we'll see
the ship."

the hispaniola lay some way out, and we went under the figureheads and
round the sterns of many other ships, and their cables sometimes grated
underneath

"well, sir," said the captain, "better speak plain, i believe, even at
the risk of offence. i don't like this cruise; i don't like the men; and
i don't like my officer. that's short and sweet."

"perhaps, sir, you don't like the ship?" inquired the squire, very
angry, as i could see.

"i can't speak as to that, sir, not having seen her tried," said the
captain. "she seems a clever craft; more i can't say."

"possibly, sir, you may not like your employer, either?" says the
squire.

but here dr. livesey cut in.

"stay a bit," said he, "stay a bit. no use of such questions as that but
to produce ill feeling. the captain has said too much or he has said too
little, and i'm bound to say that i require an explanation of his words.
you don't, you say, like this cruise. now, why?"

"i was engaged, sir, on what we call sealed orders, to sail this ship
for that gentleman where he should bid me," said the captain. "so far
so good. but now i find that every man before the mast knows more than i
do. i do

"no," said dr. livesey, "i don't."

"next," said the captain, "i learn we are going after treasure--hear
it from my own hands, mind you. now, treasure is ticklish work; i don't
like treasure voyages on any account, and i don't like them, above all,
when they are secret and when (begging your pardon, mr. trelawney) the
secret has been told to the parrot."

"silver's parrot?" asked the squire.

"it's a way of speaking," said the captain. "blabbed, i mean. it's my
belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about,

 but i'll tell
you my way of it--life or death, and a close run."

"that is all clear, and, i dare say, true enough," replied dr. livesey.
"we take the risk, but we are not so ignorant as you believe us. next,
you say you don't like the crew. are they not good seamen?"

"i don't like them, sir," returned captain smollett. "and i think i
should have had the choosing of my own hands, if you go to that."

"perhaps you should," replied the doctor. "my friend should, perhaps,
have taken you along with him; but the slight, if there be one, was
unintentional. and you don't like mr. arrow?"

"i don't, sir. i believe he's a good seaman, b

"captain smollett," began the doctor with a smile, "did ever you hear
the fable of the mountain and the mouse? you'll excuse me, i dare say,
but you remind me of that fable. when you came in here, i'll stake my
wig, you meant more than this."

"doctor," said the captain, "you are smart. when i came in here i meant
to get discharged. i had no thought that mr. trelawney would hear a
word."

"no more i would," cried the squire. "had livesey not been here i should
have seen you to the deuce. as it is, i have heard you. i will do as you
desire, but i think the worse of you."

"that's as you please, sir," said the captain. "you'll find i do my
duty."

and with that he took his leave.

"trelawney," said the doctor, "contrary to all my notions, i believed
you have managed to get two honest men on board with you--that man and
john silver."

"silver, if you like," cried the squire; "but as for that intolerable

double grog was going on the least excuse; there was duff on odd days,
as, for instance, if the squire heard it was any man's birthday, and
always a barrel of apples standing broached in the waist for anyone to
help himself that had a fancy.

"never knew good come of it yet," the captain said to dr. livesey.
"spoil forecastle hands, make devils. that's my belief."

but good did come of the apple barrel, as you shall hear, for if it had
not been for that, we should have had no note of warning and might all
have perished by the hand of treachery.

this was how it came about.

we had run up the trades to get the wind of the island we were after--i
am not allowed to be more plain--and now we were running down for it
with a bright lookout day and night. it was about the last day of our
outward voyage b

shining white on the luff of the fore-sail; and almost at the same time
the voice of the lookout shouted, "land ho!"

council of war

there was a great rush of feet across the deck. i could hear people
tumbling up from the cabin and the forecastle, and slipping in an
instant outside my barrel, i dived behind the fore-sail, made a double
towards the stern, and came out upon the open deck in time to join
hunter and dr. livesey in the rush for the weather bow.

there all hands were already congregated. a belt of fog had lifted
almost simultaneously with the appearance of the moon. away to the
south-west of us we saw two low hills, about a couple of miles apart,
and rising behind one of them a third and higher hill, whose peak was
still buried in the fog. all three seemed sharp and conical in figure.

so much i saw, almost in a dream, for i had not yet recovered from my
horrid fear of a minute or two before. and then i

may lay to that. when you want to go a bit of exploring, you just ask
old john, and he'll put up a snack for you to take along."

and clapping me in the friendliest way upon the shoulder, he hobbled off
forward and went below.

captain smollett, the squire, and dr. livesey were talking together on
the quarter-deck, and anxious as i was to tell them my story, i durst
not interrupt them openly. while i was still casting about in my
thoughts to find some probable excuse, dr. livesey called me to his
side. he had left his pipe below, and being a slave to tobacco, had
meant that i should fetch it; but as soon as i was near enough to speak
and not to be overheard, i broke immediately, "doctor, let me speak. get
the captain and squire down to the cabin, and then make so

send for me. i have terrible news."

the doctor changed countenance a little, but next moment he was master
of himself.

"thank you, jim," said he quite loudly, "that was all i wanted to know,"
as if he had asked me a question.

and with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two. they
spoke together for a little, and though none of them started, or raised
his voice, or so much as whistled, it was plain enough that dr. livesey
had communicated my request, for the next thing that i heard was the
captain giving an order to job anderson, and all hands were piped on
deck.

"my lads," said captain smollett, "i've a word to say to you. this
land that we have sighted is the place we have been sailing for. mr.
trelawney, being a very open-handed gentleman, as we all know, has just
asked me a word or two, and as i was able to tell him that every man on
board had done his duty, alow and aloft, as i never ask to see it done

as a sign that he was agitated. the stern
window was open, for it was a warm night, and you could see the moon
shining behind on the ship's wake.

"now, hawkins," said the squire, "you have something to say. speak up."

i did as i was bid, and as short as i could make it, told the whole
details of silver's conversation. nobody interrupted me till i was done,
nor did any one of the three of them make so much as a movement, but
they kept their eyes upon my face from first to last.

"jim," said dr. livesey, "take a seat."

and they made me sit down at table beside them, poured me out a glass of
wine, filled my hands with raisins, and all three, one after the other,
and each with a bow, drank my good health, and their service to me, for
my luck and courage.

"now, captain," said the squire, "you were right, and i was wrong. i own
myself an ass, and i await your orders."

"no more an ass than i, sir," returned the captain. "i never heard of a
crew that meant to mutiny but what showed signs before,

ghtily to relieve him. he re-entered the log-house and set
about counting up the stores as if nothing else existed. but he had an
eye on tom's passage for all that, and as soon as all was over, came
forward with another flag and reverently spread it on the body.

"don't you take on, sir," he said, shaking the squire's hand. "all's
well with him; no fear for a hand that's been shot down in his duty to
captain and owner. it mayn't be good divinity, but it's a fact."

then he pulled me aside.

"dr. livesey," he said, "in how many weeks do you and squire expect the
consort?"

i told him it was a question not of weeks but of months, that if we
were not back by the end of august blandly was to send to find us, but
neither sooner nor later. "you can calculate for yourself," i said.

"why, yes," returned the captain, scratching his head; "and making a
large allowance, sir, for all the gifts of providence, i should say we
were pretty close hauled."

"how do you mean?" i asked.

"it's a pity, sir, we lo

st that second load. that's what i mean,"
replied the captain. "as for powder and shot, we'll do. but the rations
are short, very short--so short, dr. livesey, that we're perhaps as well
without that extra mouth."

and he pointed to the dead body under the flag.

just then, with a roar and a whistle, a round-shot passed high above the
roof of the log-house and plumped far beyond us in the wood.

"oho!" said the captain. "blaze away! you've little enough powder
already, my lads."

at the second trial, the aim was better, and the ball descended inside
the stockade, scattering a cloud of sand but doing no further damage.

"captain," said the squire, "th

bolder than we fancied or they put more trust in israel's gunnery. for
four or five of them were busy carrying off our stores and wading out
with them to one of the gigs that lay close by, pulling an oar or so to
hold her steady against the current. silver was in the stern-sheets in
command; and every man of them was now provided with a musket from some
secret magazine of their own.

the captain sat down to his log, and here is the beginning of the entry:

     alexander smollett, master; david livesey, ship's
     doctor; abraham gray, carpenter's mate; john
     trelawney, owner; john hunter and richard joyce,
     owner's servants, landsmen--being all that is left
     faithful of the ship's company--with stores for ten
     days at short rations, came ashore this day and flew
     british colours on the log-house in treasure island.
     thomas redruth, owner's servant, landsman, shot by the
     mutineers; james hawkins, cabin-boy--

and at the same time, i was wondering over poor jim ha

ing the night out of the morass. the chill and the vapour taken
together told a poor tale of the island. it was plainly a damp,
feverish, unhealthy spot.

"keep indoors, men," said the captain. "ten to one this is a trick."

then he hailed the buccaneer.

"who goes? stand, or we fire."

"flag of truce," cried silver.

the captain was in the porch, keeping himself carefully out of the way
of a treacherous shot, should any be intended. he turned and spoke to
us, "doctor's watch on the lookout. dr. livesey take the north side,
if you please; jim, the east; gray, west. the watch below, all hands to
load muskets. lively, men, and careful."

and then he turned again to the mutineers.

"and what do you want with your flag of truce?" he cried.

this time it was the other man who replied.

"cap'n silver, sir, to come on board and make terms," he shouted.

"cap'n silver! don't know him. who's he?" cried the captain. and we
could hear him adding to himself, "cap'n, is it? my heart, and here's
promotion!"

g-house, but not one entered; and as the smoke cleared away
and vanished, the stockade and the woods around it looked as quiet and
empty as before. not a bough waved, not the gleam of a musket-barrel
betrayed the presence of our foes.

"did you hit your man?" asked the captain.

"no, sir," replied joyce. "i believe not, sir."

"next best thing to tell the truth," muttered captain smollett. "load
his gun, hawkins. how many should say there were on your side, doctor?"

"i know precisely," said dr. livesey. "three shots were fired on this
side. i saw the three flashes--two close together--one farther to the
west."

"three!" repeated the captain. "and how many on yours, mr. trelawney?"

but this was not so easily answered. there had come many from the
north--seven by the squire's computation, eight or nine according to
gray. from the east and west only a single shot had been fired. it was
plain, therefore, that the attack would be developed from the north and
that on the other three sides we were

on, the doctor took up his hat and pistols,
girt on a cutlass, put the chart in his pocket, and with a musket over
his shoulder crossed the palisade on the north side and set off briskly
through the trees.

gray and i were sitting together at the far end of the block house, to
be out of earshot of our officers consulting; and gray took his pipe out
of his mouth and fairly forgot to put it back again, so thunder-struck
he was at this occurrence.

"why, in the name of davy jones," said he, "is dr. livesey mad?"

"why no," says i. "he's about the last of this crew for that, i take
it."

"well, shipmate," said gray, "mad he may not be; but if he's not, you
mark my words, i am."

"i take it," replied i, "the doctor has his idea; and if i am right,
he's going now to see ben gunn."

i was right, as appeared later; but in the meantime, the house being
stifling hot and the little patch of sand inside the palisade ablaze
with midday sun, i began to get another thought into my head, which was
not by any

says i, growing a bit bolder, "if i'm to choose, i declare i
have a right to know what's what, and why you're here, and where my
friends are."

"wot's wot?" repeated one of the buccaneers in a deep growl. "ah, he'd
be a lucky one as knowed that!"

"you'll perhaps batten down your hatches till you're spoke to, my
friend," cried silver truculently to this speaker. and then, in
his first gracious tones, he replied to me, "yesterday morning, mr.
hawkins," said he, "in the dog-watch, down came doctor livesey with a
flag of truce. says he, 'cap'n silver, you're sold out. ship's gone.'
well, maybe we'd been taking a glass, and a song to help it round. i
won't say no. leastways, none of us had looked out. we looked out, and
by thunder, the old ship was gone! i never seen a pack o' fools look
fishier; and you may lay to that, if i tells you that looked the
fishiest. 'well,' says the doctor, 'let's bargain.' we bargained, him

to look him in the face.

he must have risen in the dark, for the day had hardly come; and when i
ran to a loophole and looked out, i saw him standing, like silver once
before, up to the mid-leg in creeping vapour.

"you, doctor! top o' the morning to you, sir!" cried silver, broad awake
and beaming with good nature in a moment. "bright and early, to be sure;
and it's the early bird, as the saying goes, that gets the rations.
george, shake up your timbers, son, and help dr. livesey over the ship's
side. all a-doin' well, your patients was--all well and merry."

so he pattered on, standing on the hilltop with his crutch under his
elbow and one hand upon the side of the log-house--quite the old john in
voice, manner, and expression.

"we've quite a surprise for you too, sir," he continued. "we've a little
stranger here--he! he! a noo boarder and lodger, sir, and looking fit
and taut as a fiddle; slep' like a supercargo, he did, right alongside
of john--stem to stem we was,

all night."

dr. livesey was by this time across the stockade and pretty near the
cook, and i could hear the alteration in his voice as he said, "not
jim?"

"the very same jim as ever was," says silver.

the doctor stopped outright, although he did not speak, and it was some
seconds before he seemed able to move on.

"well, well," he said at last, "duty first and pleasure afterwards, as
you might have said yourself, silver. let us overhaul these patients of
yours."

a moment afterwards he had entered the block house an

 mast.

"you're doing well, my friend," he said to the fellow with the bandaged
head, "and if ever any person had a close shave, it was you; your head
must be as hard as iron. well, george, how goes it? you're a pretty
colour, certainly; why, your liver, man, is upside down. did you take
that medicine? did he take that medicine, men?"

"aye, aye, sir, he took it, sure enough," returned morgan.

"because, you see, since i am mutineers' doctor, or prison doctor as i
prefer to call it," says doctor livesey in his pleasantest way, "i make
it a point of honour not to lose a man for king george (god bless him!)
and the gallows."

the rogues looked at each other but swallowed the home-thrust in
silence.

"dick don't feel well, sir," said one.

"don't he?" replied the doctor. "well, step up here, dick, and let me
see your tongue. no, i should be surprised if he did! the man's tongue
is fit to frighten the french. another fever."

"ah, there," said morgan, "that comed of sp'iling bibles."

"that comes-

wouldn't think it too much, mayhap, to give him one good word? you'll
please bear in mind it's not my life only now--it's that boy's into the
bargain; and you'll speak me fair, doctor, and give me a bit o' hope to
go on, for the sake of mercy."

silver was a changed man once he was out there and had his back to his
friends and the block house; his cheeks seemed to have fallen in, his
voice trembled; never was a soul more dead in earnest.

"why, john, you're not afraid?" asked dr. livesey.

"doctor, i'm no coward; no, not i--not so much!" and he snapped his
fingers. "if i was i wouldn't say it. but i'll own up fairly, i've the
shakes upon me for the gallows. you're a good man and a true; i never
seen a better man! and you'll not forget what i done good, not any more
than you'll forget the bad, i know. and i step aside--see here--and
leave you and jim alone. and you'll put that down for me too, for it's a
long stretch, is that!"

so saying, he stepped back a little way, till he w

 and first, i'll give you a
bit of hope; silver, if we both get alive out of this wolf-trap, i'll do
my best to save you, short of perjury."

silver's face was radiant. "you couldn't say more, i'm sure, sir, not if
you was my mother," he cried.

"well, that's my first concession," added the doctor. "my second is a
piece of advice: keep the boy close beside you, and when you need help,
halloo. i'm off to seek it for you, and that itself will show you if i
speak at random. good-bye, jim."

and dr. livesey shook hands with me through the stockade, nodded to
silver, and set off at a brisk pace into the wood.

the treasure-hunt--flint's pointer

"jim," said silver when we were alone, "if i saved your life, you saved
mine; and i'll not forget it. i seen the doctor waving you to run for
it--with the tail of my eye, i did; and i seen you say no, as plain as
hearing. jim, that's one to you. this is the first glint of hope i had
since the attack failed, and i owe it you. and now, jim, we're to go

l his kindness."

it was no wonder the men were in a good humour now. for my part, i
was horribly cast down. should the scheme he had now sketched prove
feasible, silver, already doubly a traitor, would not hesitate to adopt
it. he had still a foot in either camp, and there was no doubt he
would prefer wealth and freedom with the pirates to a bare escape from
hanging, which was the best he had to hope on our side.

nay, and even if things so fell out that he was forced to keep his faith
with dr. livesey, even then what danger lay before us! what a moment
that would be when the suspicions of his followers turned to certainty
and he and i should have to fight for dear life--he a cripple and i a
boy--against five strong and active seamen!

add to this double apprehension the mystery that still hung over the
behaviour of my friends, their unexplained desertion of the stockade,
their inexplicable cession of the chart, or harder still to understand,
the doctor's last warning to silver, "look out for

fearful glances; but he found no sympathy, and silver even joked him on
his precautions.

"i told you," said he--"i told you you had sp'iled your bible. if it
ain't no good to swear by, what do you suppose a sperrit would give for
it? not that!" and he snapped his big fingers, halting a moment on his
crutch.

but dick was not to be comforted; indeed, it was soon plain to me that
the lad was falling sick; hastened by heat, exhaustion, and the shock
of his alarm, the fever, predicted by dr. livesey, was evidently growing
swiftly higher.

it was fine open walking here, upon the summit; our way lay a little
downhill, for, as i have said, the plateau tilted towards the west. the
pines, great and small, grew wide apart; and even between the clumps of
nutmeg and azalea, wide open spaces baked in the hot sunshine. striking,
as we did, pretty near north-west across the island, we drew, on the
one hand, ever nearer under the shoulders of the spy-glass, and on the
other, looked ever wider over tha

rt of him; and ben gunn, being fleet of foot, had been dispatched in
front to do his best alone. then it had occurred to him to work upon the
superstitions of his former shipmates, and he was so far successful that
gray and the doctor had come up and were already ambushed before the
arrival of the treasure-hunters.

"ah," said silver, "it were fortunate for me that i had hawkins here.
you would have let old john be cut to bits, and never given it a
thought, doctor."

"not a thought," replied dr. livesey cheerily.

and by this time we had reached the gigs. the doctor, with the pick-axe,
demolished one of them, and then we all got aboard the other and set out
to go round by sea for north inlet.

this was a run of eight or nine miles. silver, though he was almost
killed already with fatigue, was set to an oar, like the rest of us, and
we were soon skimming swiftly over a smooth sea. soon we passed out
of the straits and doubled the south-east corner of the island, round
which, four days ago, we h
