Bianca - 
                The
younger daughter of Baptista. The lovely Bianca proves herself the
opposite of her sister, Kate, at the beginning of the play: she
is soft-spoken, sweet, and unassuming. Thus, she operates as Kate's
principal female foil. Because of her large dowry and her mild behavior,
several men vie for her hand. Baptista, however, will not let her
marry until Kate is wed.
