Selim-Calymath - 
      The Turkish leader and son of the Ottoman Emperor. Calymath awards Barabas the governorship of the island following Barabas's help in its capture. Calymath then becomes embroiled in Maltese politics as Barabas and Ferneze scheme against one another. Ultimately, Ferneze's tactics result in Calymath's capture, through which Marlowe shows how a great warlord can be felled by Machiavellian intrigue.
