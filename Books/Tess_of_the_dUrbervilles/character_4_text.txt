nging the baby from side to
side like a weaver's shuttle, as mrs durbeyfield, excited by her
song, trod the rocker with all the spring that was left in her after
a long day's seething in the suds.

nick-knock, nick-knock, went the cradle; the candle-flame stretched
itself tall, and began jigging up and down; the water dribbled from
the matron's elbows, and the song galloped on to the end of the
verse, mrs durbeyfield regarding her daughter the while.  even now,
when burdened with a young family, joan durbeyfield was a passionate
lover of tune.  no ditty floated into blackmoor vale from the outer
world but tess's mother caught up its notation in a week.

there still faintly beamed from the woman's features something of
the freshness, and even the prettiness, of her youth; rendering it
probable that the personal charms which tess could boast of were in
main part her mother's gift, and therefore unknightly, unhistorical.

"i'll rock the cradle for 'ee, mother," said the daughter gently.
"or i'll take off

from shaston, and he has been telling me the whole pedigree of the

"where is father now?" asked tess suddenly.

her mother gave irrelevant information by way of answer: "he called
to see the doctor to-day in shaston.  it is not consumption at all,
it seems.  it is fat round his heart, 'a says.  there, it is like
this."  joan durbeyfield, as she spoke, curved a sodden thumb
and forefinger to the shape of the letter c, and used the other
forefinger as a pointer.  "'at the present moment,' he says to your
father, 'your heart is enclosed all round there, and all round
there; this space is still open,' 'a says.  'as soon as it do

complete--"'off you will go like a shadder, mr durbeyfield,' 'a says.
'you mid last ten years; you mid go off in ten months, or ten days.'"

see me?"  she nudged him, while he, looking through her as through a
window-pane, went on with his recitative.

"hush!  don't 'ee sing so loud, my good man," said the landlady; "in
case any member of the gover'ment should be passing, and take away my
licends."

"he's told 'ee what's happened to us, i suppose?" asked mrs
durbeyfield.

"yes--in a way.  d'ye think there's any money hanging by it?"

"ah, that's the secret," said joan durbeyfield sagely.  "however,
'tis well to be kin to a coach, even if you don't ride in 'en."  she
dropped her public voice, and continued in a low tone to her husband:
"i've been thinking since you brought the news that there's a great
rich lady out by trantridge, on the edge o' the chase, of the name of
d'urberville."

"hey--what's that?" said sir john.

she repeated the information.  "that lady must be our relation," she
said.  "and my projick is to send tess to claim kin."

"there is a lady of the nam

s tractable at bottom.  leave her to me."

though this conversation had been private, sufficient of its import
reached the understandings of those around to suggest to them that
the durbeyfields had weightier concerns to talk of now than common
folks had, and that tess, their pretty eldest daughter, had fine
prospects in store.

"tess is a fine figure o' fun, as i said to myself to-day when i zeed
her vamping round parish with the rest," observed one of the elderly
boozers in an undertone.  "but joan durbeyfield must mind that she
don't get green malt in floor."  it was a local phrase which had a
peculiar meaning, and there was no reply.

the conversation became inclusive, and presently other footsteps were
heard crossing the room below.

"--being a few private friends asked in to-night to keep up
club-walking at my own expense."  the landlady had rapidly re-used
the formula she kept on hand for intruders before she recognized that
the newcomer was tess.

even to her mother's gaze the girl's young feat

nks in search of
vegetable and mineral treasures; her then earth-coloured hair hanging
like pot-hooks; the arms of the two outside girls resting round the
waist of tess; her arms on the shoulders of the two supporters.

as tess grew older, and began to see how matters stood, she felt
quite a malthusian towards her mother for thoughtlessly giving her so
many little sisters and brothers, when it was such a trouble to nurse
and provide for them.  her mother's intelligence was that of a happy
child: joan durbeyfield was simply an additional one, and that not
the eldest, to her own long family of waiters on providence.

however, tess became humanely beneficent towards the small ones,
and to help them as much as possible she used, as soon as she left
school, to lend a hand at haymaking or harvesting on neighbouring
farms; or, by preference, at milking or butter-making processes,
which she had learnt when her father had owned cows; and being
deft-fingered it was a kind of work in which she excelled.

l proud enough, after the visitor's remarks, to say a good
deal.

thus it was arranged; and the young girl wrote, agreeing to be ready
to set out on any day on which she might be required.  she was duly
informed that mrs d'urberville was glad of her decision, and that a
spring-cart should be sent to meet her and her luggage at the top
of the vale on the day after the morrow, when she must hold herself
prepared to start.  mrs d'urberville's handwriting seemed rather
masculine.

"a cart?" murmured joan durbeyfield doubtingly.  "it might have been
a carriage for her own kin!"

having at last taken her course tess was less restless and
abstracted, going about her business with some self-assurance in the
thought of acquiring another horse for her father by an occupation
which would not be onerous.  she had hoped to be a teacher at the
school, but the fates seemed to decide otherwise.  being mentally
older than her mother she did not regard mrs durbeyfield's
matrimonial hopes for her in a serious aspect for

she is such an odd maid that it mid zet her against him, or against
going there, even now.  if all goes well, i shall certainly be for
making some return to pa'son at stagfoot lane for telling us--dear,
good man!"

however, as the moment for the girl's setting out drew nigh, when the
first excitement of the dressing had passed off, a slight misgiving
found place in joan durbeyfield's mind.  it prompted the matron to
say that she would walk a little way--as far as to the point where
the acclivity from the valley began its first steep ascent to
the outer world.  at the top tess was going to be met with the
spring-cart sent by the stoke-d'urbervilles, and her box had already
been wheeled ahead towards this summit by a lad with trucks, to be in
readiness.

seeing their mother put on her bonnet, the younger children clamoured
to go with her.

"i do want to walk a little-ways w

low cart with the box, and disappeared
behind the shoulder of the hill.

directly tess was out of sight, and the interest of the matter as a
drama was at an end, the little ones' eyes filled with tears.  the
youngest child said, "i wish poor, poor tess wasn't gone away to be a
lady!" and, lowering the corners of his lips, burst out crying.  the
new point of view was infectious, and the next child did likewise,
and then the next, till the whole three of them wailed loud.

there were tears also in joan durbeyfield's eyes as she turned to
go home.  but by the time she had got back to the village she was
passively trusting to the favour of accident.  however, in bed that
night she sighed, and her husband asked her what was the matter.

"oh, i don't know exactly," she said.  "i was thinking that perhaps
it would ha' been better if tess had not gone."

"oughtn't ye to have thought of that before?"

"well, 'tis a chance for the maid--still, if 'twere the doing again,
i wouldn't let her go till i had found out

"at the same place--marlott.  on the further side of blackmoor vale."

"ah, then i have seen you before this summer--"

"yes; at that dance on the green; but you would not dance with me.
o, i hope that is of no ill-omen for us now!"

tess wrote a most touching and urgent letter to her mother the very
next day, and by the end of the week a response to her communication
arrived in joan durbeyfield's wandering last-century hand.


   dear tess,--

   j write these few lines hoping they will find you well,
   as they leave me at present, thank god for it.  dear
   tess, we are all glad to hear that you are going really
   to be married soon.  but with respect to your question,
   tess, j say between ourselves, quite private but very
   strong, that on no account do you say a word of your
   bygone trouble to him.  j did not tell everything
   to your father, he being so proud on account of

"yes, mother; so i am."

"going to be?"

"no--i am married."

"married!  then where's thy husband?"

"oh, he's gone away for a time."

"gone away!  when was you married, then?  the day you said?"

"yes, tuesday, mother."

"and now 'tis on'y saturday, and he gone away?"

"yes, he's gone."

"what's the meaning o' that?  'nation seize such husbands as you seem
to get, say i!"

"mother!"  tess went across to joan durbeyfield, laid her face upon
the matron's bosom, and burst into sobs.  "i don't know how to tell
'ee, mother!  you said to me, and wrote to me, that i was not to tell
him.  but i did tell him--i couldn't help it--and he went away!"

"o you little fool--you little fool!" burst out mrs durbeyfield,
splashing tess and herself in her agitation.  "my good god! that ever
i should ha' lived to say it, but i say it again, you little fool!"

tess was convulsed with weeping, the tension of so many days having

e some strange experiences in his absence; he had seen
the virtual faustina in the literal cornelia, a spiritual lucretia in
a corporeal phryne; he had thought of the woman taken and set in the
midst as one deserving to be stoned, and of the wife of uriah being
made a queen; and he had asked himself why he had not judged tess
constructively rather than biographically, by the will rather than
by the deed?

a day or two passed while he waited at his father's house for the
promised second note from joan durbeyfield, and indirectly to recover
a little more strength.  the strength showed signs of coming back,
but there was no sign of joan's letter.  then he hunted up the
old letter sent on to him in brazil, which tess had written from
flintcomb-ash, and re-read it.  the sentences touched him now as
much as when he had first perused them.
