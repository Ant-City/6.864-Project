[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER] is a former governess who is working as
a "games mistress at a third-class school" when the novel begins.
she takes a summer job on indian island, believing that she has
been hired to serve as a secretary to a mrs. una owen. like the
other characters, vera has a dark secret. at her last job, she was
governess to a spoiled little rich boy named cyril hamilton. she
let cyril drown so that his relative, hugo, would inherit his money
and then be rich enough to marry her. an inquest cleared
her of any wrongdoing, but hugo, certain that vera had let cyril
die, would have nothing more to do with her. throughout the novel,
vera's guilty memories of her crime plague her. she often thinks
of hugo and feels as if he is watching her.
	in some ways, vera is one of the most intelligent and
capable characters in the novel, which explains why she is one of
the last people left standing. she outwits the resourceful philip
lombard, who thinks she is a murderer, by stealing his gun and then
summoning up the courage to shoot him when he leaps at her. despite
her strength, however, vera is not emotionally stable. in addition
to her recurrent bouts of guilt over cyril's death, she is strongly
affected by the almost supernatural nature of the events on the
island and prone to attacks of nervous hysteria. more than anyone
else, she fixates on the "ten little indians" poem that lends an
air of eerie inevitability to the murders. the confluence of these
factors--her guilt, her tendency toward hysteria, and her fascination
with the nursery rhyme--enables wargrave to create a suggestive environment
complete with a noose and the smell of the sea, which inspires vera
to hang herself and fulfill the last line of the poem.
