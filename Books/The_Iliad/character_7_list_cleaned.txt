[CHARACTER] - 
                    king
of pylos and the oldest achaean commander. although age has taken
much of [CHARACTER]'s physical strength, it has left him with great wisdom.
he often acts as an advisor to the military commanders, especially
agamemnon. [CHARACTER] and odysseus are the achaeans' most deft and persuasive
orators, although [CHARACTER]'s speeches are sometimes long-winded.
