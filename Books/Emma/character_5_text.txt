â€œoh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to highbury. by the bye, that is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece. heaven forbid! at least, that i should ever bore people half so much about all the knightleys together, as she does about jane fairfax. one is sick of the very name of jane fairfax. every letter from her is read forty times over; her compliments to all friends go round and round again; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher, or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother, one hears of nothing else for a month. i wish jane fairfax very well; but she tires me to death.â€

and she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when forced to give her attention again to her father and sister, she had nothing worse to hear than isabellaâ€™s kind inquiry after jane fairfax; and jane fairfax, though no great favourite with her in general, she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising.
â€œthat sweet, amiable jane fairfax!â€ said mrs. john knightley.â€”â€œit is so long since i have seen her, except now and then for a moment accidentally in town! what happiness it must be to her good old grandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them! i always regret excessively on dear emmaâ€™s account that she cannot be more at highbury; but now their daugh

this topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of similar moment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening did not close without a little return of agitation. the gruel came and supplied a great deal to be saidâ€”much praise and many commentsâ€”undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution, and pretty severe philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tol

the house belonged to people in business. mrs. and miss bates occupied the drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sized apartment, which was every thing to them, the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner, wanting even to give up her place to miss woodhouse, and her more active, talking daughter, almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness, thanks for their visit, solicitu

and emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it. she was pondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seeming very rude, of making her escape from jane fairfaxâ€™s letter, and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse, when miss bates turned to her again and seized her attention.
â€œmy motherâ€™s deafness is very trifling you seeâ€”just nothing at all. by only raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over, she is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice. but it is very remarkable that she should always hear jane better than she does me. jane speaks so distinct! however, she will not find her grandmam

at this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering emmaâ€™s brain with regard to jane fairfax, this charming mr. dixon, and the not going to ireland, she said, with the insidious design of farther discovery,
â€œyou must feel it very fortunate that miss fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time. considering the very particular friendship between her and mrs. dixon, you could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying colonel and mrs. campbell.â€

and not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded. she regained the streetâ€”happy in this, that though much had been forced on her against her will, though she had in fact heard the whole substance of jane fairfaxâ€™s letter, she had been able to escape the letter itself.




chapter ii

jane fairfax was an orphan, the only child of mrs. batesâ€™s youngest daughter.
the marriage of lieut. fairfax of the â€”â€”regiment of infantry, and miss jane bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure, hope and interest; but nothing now remained of it, save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroadâ€”of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwardsâ€”and this girl.

the plan was that she should be brought up for educating others; the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible. to provide for her otherwise was out of colonel campbellâ€™s power; for though his income, by pay and appointments, was handsome, his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughterâ€™s; but, by giving her an education, he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter.
such was jane fairfaxâ€™s history. she had fallen into good hands, known nothing but kindness from the campbells, and been given an excellent education. living constantly with right-minded and well-informed people, her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture; and colonel campbellâ€™s residence being in london, every lighter talent had been done full justice to, by the attendance of first-rate masters. her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship coul

this event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning. she had long resolved that one-and-twenty should be the period. with the fortitude of a devoted novitiate, she had resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice, and retire from all the pleasures of life, of rational intercours

emma was sorry;â€”to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months!â€”to be always doing more than she wished, and less than she ought! why she did not like jane fairfax might be a difficult question to answer; mr. knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman, which she wanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at

it was a dislike so little justâ€”every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy, that she never saw jane fairfax the first time after any considerable absence, without feeling that she had injured her; and now, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two yearsâ€™ interval, she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating. jane fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had herself the highest value for elegance. her height was pretty, just such as almost every body would think tall, and nobody could think ve

in short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at jane fairfax with twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice, and was determining that she would dislike her no longer. when she took in her history, indeed, her situation, as well as her beauty; when she considered what all this elegance was destined to, what she was going to sink from, how she was going to live, it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect; especially, if to every well-known particular entitling her to interest, were added the highly

upon the whole, emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings, as made her look around in walking home, and lament that highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence; nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her.
these were charming feelingsâ€”but not lasting. before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for jane fairfax, or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors, than saying to mr. knightley, â€œshe certainly is handsome; she is better than handsome!â€ jane had spent an evening at hartfield with her grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state. former provocations reappeared. the aunt was as tiresome as ever; more tiresome, because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how l

â€œi hope every body had a pleasant evening,â€ said mr. woodhouse, in his quiet way. â€œi had. once, i felt the fire rather too much; but then i moved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did not disturb me. miss bates was very chatty and good-humoured, as she always is, though she speaks rather too quick. however, she is very agreeable, and mrs. bates too, in a different way. i like old friends; and miss jane fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady, a very pretty and a very well-behaved young lady indeed. she must have found the evening agreeable, mr. knightley, because she had emma.â€
â€œtrue, sir; and emma, because she had miss fairfax.â€
emma saw his anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for the present, said, and with a sincerity which no one could questionâ€”

he agreed to it, but with so quiet a â€œyes,â€ as inclined her almost to doubt his real concurrence; and yet there must be a very distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world, if jane fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it.

mrs. cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from colonel campbell, and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there were enough ready to speak to allow emma to think her own way, and still listen to mrs. cole.
â€œi declare, i do not know when i have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction!â€”it always has quite hurt me that jane fairfax, who plays so delightfully, should not have an instrument. it seemed quite a shame, especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away. this is like giving ourselves a slap, to be sure! and it was but yesterday i was telling mr. cole, i really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing-room, while i do not know one note from another, and our little girls, who are but just beginning, perhaps may never make any thing of it; and t

in so large a party it was not necessary that emma should approach her. she did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she felt too much in the secret herself, to think the appearanc

y thing. my dear emma, i am longing to talk to you. i have been making discoveries and forming plans, just like yourself, and i must tell them while the idea is fresh. do you know how miss bates and her niece came here?â€
â€œhow?â€”they were invited, were not they?â€
â€œoh! yesâ€”but how they were conveyed hither?â€”the manner of their coming?â€
â€œthey walked, i conclude. how else could they come?â€
â€œvery true.â€”well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have jane fairfax walking home again, late at night, and cold as the nights are now. and as i looked at her, though i never saw her appear to more advantage, it struck me that she was heated, and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold. poor girl! i could not bear the idea of it; so, as soon as mr. weston came into the room, and i could get at him, i spoke to him about the carriage. you may guess how readily he came into my wishes; and having his approbation, i made my way directly to miss bates, to

â€œvery likely,â€ said emmaâ€”â€œnothing more likely. i know no man more likely than mr. knightley to do the sort of thingâ€”to do any thing really good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent. he is not a gallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this, considering jane fairfaxâ€™s ill-health, would appear a case of humanity to him;â€”and for an act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody whom i would fix on more than on mr. knightley. i know he had horses to-dayâ€”for we arrived together; and i laughed at him about it, but he said not a word that could betray.â€
â€œwell,â€ said mrs. weston, smiling, â€œyou give him credit for more simple, disinterested benevolence in this instance than i do; for while miss bates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head, an

â€œnay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you very well know.â€
â€œbut the imprudence of such a match!â€
â€œi am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability.â€
â€œi see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation than what you mention. his good-nature, his humanity, as i tell you, would be quite enough to account for the horses. he has a great regard for the bateses, you know, independent of jane fairfaxâ€”and is always glad to

â€œimprudent, if you pleaseâ€”but not mad. excepting inequality of fortune, and perhaps a little disparity of age, i can see nothing unsuitable.â€

they combated the point some time longer in the same way; emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend; for mrs. weston was the most used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;â€”and at the same moment mr. cole approaching to entreat miss woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it. frank churchill, of whom, in the eagerness of her conversation with mrs. weston, she had been seeing nothing, except

presently mr. knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her. they talked at first only of the performance. his admiration was certainly very warm; yet she thought, but for mrs. weston, it would not have struck her. as a sort of touchstone, however, she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece; and though his answer was i

while waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off, emma found time, in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her voice and her taste, to look about, and see what became of mr. knightley. this would be a trial. he was no dancer in general. if he were to be very alert in engaging jane fairfax now, it might augur something. there was no immediate appearance. no; he was talking to mrs. coleâ€”he was looking on unconcerned; jane was asked by somebody else, and he was still talking to mrs. cole.
emma had no longer an alarm for henry; his interest was yet safe; and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment. not more than five couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very delightful, and she found herself well matched in a partner. they were

perfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were two points on which she was not quite easy. she doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying her suspicions of jane fairfaxâ€™s feelings to frank churchill. it was hardly right; but it had been so strong an idea, that it would escape her, and his submission to all that she told, was a compliment to her penetration, which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue.
the other circumstance of regret related also to jane fairfax; and there she had no doubt. she did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing. she did most heartily grieve o

â€œoh! dearâ€”i think you play the best of the two. i think you play quite as well as she does. i am sure i had much rather hear you. every body last night said how well you played.â€
â€œthose who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference. the truth is, harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised, but jane fairfaxâ€™s is much beyond it.â€
â€œwell, i always shall think that you play quite as well as she does, or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out. mr. cole said how much taste you had; and mr. frank churchill talked a great deal about your taste, and that he valued taste much more than execution.â€
â€œah! but jane fairfax has them both, harriet.â€

the appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered, was tranquillity itself; mrs. bates, deprived of her usual employment, slumbering on one side of the fire, frank churchill, at a table near her, most deedily occupied about her spectacles, and jane fairfax, standing with her back to them, intent on her pianoforte.
busy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing emma again.

he contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her, and trying to make her help or advise him in his work, till jane fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again. that she was not immediately ready, emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves; she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion; she must reason herself into the power of performance; and emma could not but pity such feelings, whatever their origin, and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again.

emma wished he would be less pointed, yet could not help being amused; and when on glancing her eye towards jane fairfax she caught the remains of a smile, when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness, there had been a smile of secret delight, she had less scruple in the amusement, and much less compunction with respect to her.â€”this amiable, upright, perfect jane fairfax was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings.

this emma felt was aimed at her; and it made her quite angry. it was not in compliment to jane fairfax however that he was so indifferent, or so indignant; he was not guided by her feelings in reprobating the ball, for she enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree. it made her animatedâ€”open heartedâ€”she voluntarily said;â€”
â€œoh! miss woodhouse, i hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball. what a disappointment it would be! i do look forward to it, i own, with very great pleasure.â€
it was not to oblige jane fairfax therefore that he would have preferred the society of william

mr. knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness. he could not say that he was sorry on his own account; his very cheerful look would have contradicted him if he had; but he said, and very steadily, that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others, and with considerable kindness added,
â€œyou, emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing, you are really out of luck; you are very much out of luck!â€
it was some days before she saw jane fairfax, to judge of her honest regret in this woeful change; but when they did meet, her composure was odious. she had been particularly unwell, however, suffering from headache to a degree, which made her aunt declare, that had the ball taken place, she did not think jane could have attended it; and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of ill-health.

mrs. elton was first seen at church: but though devotion might be interrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew, and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid, to settle whether she were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty, or not pretty at all.

mrs. elton took a great fancy to jane fairfax; and from the first. not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other, but from the very first; and she was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admirationâ€”but without solicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting to assist and befriend her.â€”before emma had forfeited her confidence, and about the third time of their meeting, she heard all mrs. eltonâ€™s knight-errantry on the subject.â€”

emma returned her friendâ€™s pressure with interest; and was pleased enough to exclaim,
â€œyou are not vain, mr. knightley. i will say that for you.â€
he seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtfulâ€”and in a manner which shewed him not pleased, soon afterwards said,
â€œso you have been settling that i should marry jane fairfax?â€
â€œno indeed i have not. you have scolded me too much for match-making, for me to presume to take such a liberty with you. what i said just now, meant nothing. one says those sort of things, of course, without any idea of a serious meaning. oh! no, upon my word i have not the smallest wish for your marrying jane fairfax or jane any body. you would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way, if you were married.â€
mr. knightley was thoughtful again. the result of his reverie was, â

emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault. â€œwell,â€ said she, â€œand you soon silenced mr. cole, i suppose?â€
â€œyes, very soon. he gave me a quiet hint; i told him he was mistaken; he asked my pardon and said no more. cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours.â€

â€œthis is very true,â€ said she, â€œat least as far as relates to me, which was all that was meantâ€”and it is very shameful.â€”of the same ageâ€”and always knowing herâ€”i ought to have been more her friend.â€”she w

she could have made an inquiry or two, as to the expedition and the expense of the irish mails;â€”it was at her tongueâ€™s endâ€”but she abstained. she was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt jane fairfaxâ€™s feelings; and they followed the other ladies out of the room, arm in arm, with an appearance of good-will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each.

when the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, emma found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;â€”with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did mrs. elton engross jane fairfax and slight herself. she and mrs. weston were obliged to be almost always either talking togethe

in this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, june opened upon hartfield. to highbury in general it brought no material change. the eltons were still talking of a visit from the sucklings, and of the use to be made of their barouche-landau; and jane fairfax was still at her grandmotherâ€™s; and as the return of the campbells from ireland was again delayed, and august, instead of midsummer, fixed for it, she was likely to remain there full two months longer, provided at least she were able to defeat mrs. eltonâ€™s activity in her service, and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will.

g to dislike him more. he began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of emma. that emma was his object appeared indisputable. every thing declared it; his own attentions, his fatherâ€™s hints, his mother-in-lawâ€™s guarded silence; it was all in unison; words, conduct, discretion, and indiscretion, told the same story. but while so many were devoting him to emma, and emma herself making him over to harriet, mr. knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with jane fairfax. he could not understand it; but there were symptoms of intelligence between themâ€”he thought so at leastâ€”symptoms of admiration on his side, which, having once observed, he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning, however he might wish to escape any of emmaâ€™s errors of imagination. she was not present when the suspicion first arose. he was dining with the randalls family, and jane, at the eltonsâ€™; and he had seen a look, more than a single look, at miss fairfax, whi

it was done however. this gallant young man, who seemed to love without feeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance, directly handed over the word to miss fairfax, and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it. mr. knightleyâ€™s excessive curiosity to know what this word might be, made him seize every possible moment for darting his eye towards it, and it was not long before he saw it to be dixon. jane fairfaxâ€™s perception seemed to accompany his; her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning, the superior intelligence, of those five letters so arranged. she was evidently displeased; looked up, and seeing herself watched, blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her, and saying only, â€œi did not know that proper names were allowed,â€ pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit, and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered. her face was av

â€œyou may depend upon me,â€ said she. â€œi certainly will come. name your day, and i will come. you will allow me to bring jane fairfax?â€

seats tolerably in the shade were found; and now emma was obliged to overhear what mrs. elton and jane fairfax were talking of.â€”a situation, a most desirable situation, was in question. mrs. elton had received notice of it that morning, and was in raptures. it was not with mrs. suckling, it was not with mrs. bragge, but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them: it was with a cousin of mrs. bragge, an acquaintance of mrs. suckling, a lady known at maple grove. delightful, charming, superior, first circles, spheres, lines, ranks, every thingâ€”and mrs. elton was wild to have the offer closed

ating all that was immediately important of their state and plans. mr. churchill was better than could be expected; and their first removal, on the departure of the funeral for yorkshire, was to be to the house of a very old friend in windsor, to whom mr. churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years. at present, there was nothing to be done for harriet; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on emmaâ€™s side.
it was a more pressing concern to shew attention to jane fairfax, whose prospects were closing, while harrietâ€™s opened, and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at highbury, who wished to shew her kindnessâ€”and with emma it was grown into a first wish. she had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness; and the person, whom she had been so many months neglecting, was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy. she wanted to be of use to her; wanted to shew a value for her society, an

emma even jumped with surprize;â€”and, horror-struck, exclaimed,
â€œjane fairfax!â€”good god! you are not serious? you do not mean it?â€
â€œyou may well be amazed,â€ returned mrs. weston, still averting her eyes, and talking on with eagerness, that emma might have time to recoverâ€” â€œyou may well be amazed. but it is even so. there has been a solemn engagement between them ever since octoberâ€”formed at weymouth, and kept a secret from every body. not a creature knowing it but themselvesâ€”neither the campbells, nor her family, nor his.â€”it is so wonderful, that though

â€œmuch, indeed!â€ cried emma feelingly. â€œif a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation like jane fairfaxâ€™s.â€”of such, one may almost say, that â€˜the world is not theirâ€™s, nor the worldâ€™s law.â€™â€
she met mr. weston on his entrance, with a smiling countenance, exclaiming,
â€œa very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word! this was a device, i suppose, to sport with my curiosity, and exercise my talent of guessing. but you really frightened me. i thought you had lost half your property, at least. and here, instead of its being a matter of condolence, it turns out to be one of c

m.â€”she felt that she had been risking her friendâ€™s happiness on most insufficient grounds. common sense would have directed her to tell harriet, that she must not allow herself to think of him, and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her.â€”â€œbut, with common sense,â€ she added, â€œi am afraid i have had little to do.â€
she was extremely angry with herself. if she could not have been angry with frank churchill too, it would have been dreadful.â€”as for jane fairfax, she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account. harriet would be anxiety enough; she need no longer be unhappy about jane, whose troubles and whose ill-health having, of course, the same origin, must be equally under cure.â€”her days of insignificance and evil were over.â€”she would soon be well, and happy, and prosperous.â€”emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted. this discovery laid many smaller matters open. no doubt it had been fr

om jealousy.â€”in janeâ€™s eyes she had been a rival; and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed. an airing in the hartfield carriage would have been the rack, and arrowroot from the hartfield storeroom must have been poison. she understood it all; and as far as her mind could disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she acknowledged that jane fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her desert. but poor harriet was such an engrossing charge! there was little sympathy to be spared for any body else. emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first. considering the very superior claims of the object, it ought; and judging by its apparently stronger effect on harrietâ€™s mind, producing reserve and self-command, it would.â€”she must communicate the painful truth, however, and as soon a

 hearing harrietâ€™s footstep and voice; so, she supposed, had poor mrs. weston felt when she was approaching randalls. could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance!â€”but of that, unfortunately, there could be no chance.
â€œwell, miss woodhouse!â€ cried harriet, coming eagerly into the roomâ€”â€œis not this the oddest news that ever was?â€
â€œwhat news do you mean?â€ replied emma, unable to guess, by look or voice, whether harriet could indeed have received any hint.
â€œabout jane fairfax. did you ever hear any thing so strange? oh!â€”you need not be afraid of owning it to me, for mr. weston has told me himself. i met him just now. he told me it was to be a great secret; and, therefore, i should not think of mentioning it to any body but you, but he said you knew it.â€
â€œwhat did mr. weston tell you?â€â€”said emma, still perplexed.
â€œoh! he told me all about it; that jane fairfax and mr. frank churchill are to be married, and that they have been privately engaged to one anot

you, perhaps, might.â€”you (blushing as she spoke) who can see into every bodyâ€™s heart; but nobody elseâ€”â€
â€œupon my word,â€ said emma, â€œi begin to doubt my having any such talent. can you seriously ask me, harriet, whether i imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that i wasâ€”tacitly, if not openlyâ€”encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?â€”i never had the slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of mr. frank churchillâ€™s having the least regard for jane fairfax. you may be very sure that if i had, i should have cautioned you accordingly.â€
â€œme!â€ cried harriet, colouring, and astonished. â€œwhy should you caution me?â€”you do not think i care about mr. frank churchill.â€
â€œi am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,â€ replied emma, smiling; â€œbut you do not mean to deny that there was a timeâ€”and not very distant eitherâ€”when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him?â€
â€œhim!â€”never, never. dear miss wo

t that the utmost extent of harrietâ€™s hopes should be enquired into; and harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintainedâ€”or to deserve to be slighted by the person, whose counsels had never led her right.â€”rousing from reflection, therefore, and subduing her emotion, she turned to harriet again, and, in a more inviting accent, renewed the conversation; for as to the subject which had first introduced it, the wonderful story of jane fairfax, that was quite sunk and lost.â€”neither of them thought but of mr. knightley and themselves.
harriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet very glad to be called from it, by the now encouraging manner of such a judge, and such a friend as miss woodhouse, and only wanted invitation, to give the history of her hopes with great, though trembling delight.â€”emmaâ€™s tremblings as she asked, and as she listened, were better concealed than harrietâ€™s, but they were not less. her voi

riet, on herself, and she too much feared, on mr. knightley.â€”were this most unequal of all connexions to take place, on her must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning; for his attachment, she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of harrietâ€™s;â€”and even were this not the case, he would never have known harriet at all but for her folly.
mr. knightley and harriet smith!â€”it was a union to distance every wonder of the kind.â€”the attachment of frank churchill and jane fairfax became commonplace, threadbare, stale in the comparison, exciting no surprize, presenting no disparity, affording nothing to be said or thought.â€”mr. knightley and harriet smith!â€”such an elevation on her side! such a debasement on his! it was horrible to emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion, to foresee the smiles, the sneers, the merriment it would prompt at his expense; the mortification and disdain of his brother, the thousand inconveniences to himself.â€”could it be?â

oolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so unpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of janeâ€™s feelings, by the levity or carelessness of frank churchillâ€™s. of all the sources of evil surrounding the former, since her coming to highbury, she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst. she must have been a perpetual enemy. they never could have been all three together, without her having stabbed jane fairfaxâ€™s peace in a thousand instances; and on box hill, perhaps, it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no more.
the evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at hartfield. the weather added what it could of gloom. a cold stormy rain set in, and nothing of july appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which the wind was despoiling, and the length of the day, which only made such cruel sights the longer visible.
the weather affected mr. woodhouse, and he could only be kept tolerably c

 have no doubt of their being happy together,â€ said emma; â€œi believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached.â€
â€œhe is a most fortunate man!â€ returned mr. knightley, with energy. â€œso early in lifeâ€”at three-and-twentyâ€”a period when, if a man chuses a wife, he generally chuses ill. at three-and-twenty to have drawn such a prize! what years of felicity that man, in all human calculation, has before him!â€”assured of the love of such a womanâ€”the disinterested love, for jane fairfaxâ€™s character vouches for her disinterestedness; every thing in his favour,â€”equality of situationâ€”i mean, as far as regards society, and all the habits and manners that are important; equality in every point but oneâ€”and that one, since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted, such as must increase his felicity, for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants.â€”a man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from; and he who can do it, where

after this, he made some progress without any pause. frank churchillâ€™s confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing.
â€œi perfectly agree with you, sir,â€â€”was then his remark. â€œyou did behave very shamefully. you never wrote a truer line.â€ and having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement, and his persisting to act in direct opposition to jane fairfaxâ€™s sense of right, he made a fuller pause to say, â€œthis is very bad.â€”he had induced her to place herself, for his sake, in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness, and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily.â€”she must have had much more to contend with, in carrying on the correspondence, than he could. he should have respected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such; but hers were all reasonable. we must look to her one fault, and

it is remarkable, that emma, in the many, very many, points of view in which she was now beginning to consider donwell abbey, was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew henry, whose rights as heir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded. think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy; and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it, and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of mr. knightleyâ€™s marrying jane fairfax, or any body else, which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt.
this proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at hartfieldâ€”the more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became. his evils seemed to lessen, her own advantages to increase, their mutual good to outweigh every drawback. such a companion for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!â€”such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time

 most gradual, natural manner.
before the end of september, emma attended harriet to church, and saw her hand bestowed on robert martin with so complete a satisfaction, as no remembrances, even connected with mr. elton as he stood before them, could impair.â€”perhaps, indeed, at that time she scarcely saw mr. elton, but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself.â€”robert martin and harriet smith, the latest couple engaged of the three, were the first to be married.
jane fairfax had already quitted highbury, and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the campbells.â€”the mr. churchills were also in town; and they were only waiting for november.
the intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared, by emma and mr. knightley.â€”they had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while john and isabella were still at hartfield, to allow them the fortnightâ€™s absence in a tour to the seaside, which was the plan.â€”john and isabella, a
