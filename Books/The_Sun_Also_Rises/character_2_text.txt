is nose permanently flattened. this increased
cohn's distaste for boxing, but it gave him a certain satisfaction of some strange sort, and it certainly improved his
nose. in his last year at princeton he read too much and took to wearing spectacles. i never met any one of his class
who remembered him. they did not even remember that he was middleweight boxing champion.

i mistrust all frank and simple people, especially when their stories hold together, and i always had a suspicion
that perhaps robert cohn had never been middleweight boxing champion, and that perhaps a horse had stepped on
his  face,  or  that  maybe  his  mother  had  been  frightened  or  seen  something,  or  that  he  had,  maybe,  bumped  into
something as a young child, but i finally had somebody verify the story from spider kelly. spider kelly not only
remembered cohn. he had often wondered what had become of him.

robert cohn was a member, through his father, of one of the richest jewish families in new york, and through

  dollars  his  father  left  him,  the  balance  of  the  estate  having  gone  to  his  mother,
hardened into a rather unattractive mould under domestic unhappiness with a rich wife; and just when he had made
up his mind to leave his wife she left him and went off with a miniature-painter. as he had been thinking for months
about leaving his wife and had not done it because it would be too cruel to deprive her of himself, her departure was
a very healthful shock.

the divorce was arranged and robert cohn went out to the coast. in california he fell among literary people
and, as he still had a little of the fifty thousand left, in a short time he was backing a review of the arts. the review
commenced publication in carmel, california, and finished in provincetown, massachusetts. by that time cohn,
who had been regarded purely as an angel, and whose name had appeared on the editorial page merely as a member
of the advisory board, had become the sole editor. it was his money and he discovered he l

she urged that they go to europe, where cohn could write. they came to europe, where the lady had been educated,
and stayed three years. during these three years, the first spent in travel, the last two in paris, robert cohn had two
friends, braddocks and myself. braddocks was his literary friend. i was his tennis friend.
the lady who had him, her name was frances, found toward the end of the second year that her looks were

going,  and  her  attitude  toward  robert  changed  from  one  of  careless  possession  and  exploitation  to  the  absolute
determination that he should marry her. during this time robert's mother had settled an allowance on him, about

lf i do not believe that robert cohn looked at another
woman. he was fairly happy, except that, like many people living in europe, he would rather have been in america,
and he had discovered writing. he wrote a novel, and it was not really such a bad novel as the critics later called it,
although  it  was  a  very  poor  novel.  he  read  many  books,  played  bridge,  played  tennis,  and  boxed  at  a  local
gymnasium.

that winter robert cohn went over to america with his novel, and it was accepted by a fairly good publisher.
his going made an awful row i heard, and i think that was where frances lost him, because several women were
nice to him in new york, and when he came back he was quite changed. he was more enthusiastic about america
than ever, and he was not so simple, and he was not so nice. the publishers had praised his novel pretty highly and
it rather went to his head. then several women had put themselves out to be nice

shove off. i put my hand on his shoulder. he shook his head. "i can't do it," he said, and put his head deeper into his

brett smiled at him. "i've promised to dance this with jacob," she laughed. "you've a hell of a biblical name,

was like a certain stretch on the p.l.m. between fontainebleau and montereau that always made me feel bored and
dead and dull until it was over. i suppose it is some association of ideas that makes those dead places in a journey.
there are other streets in paris as ugly as the boulevard raspail. it is a street i do not mind walking down at all. but
i cannot stand to ride along it. perhaps i had read something about it once. that was the way robert cohn was about
all  of  paris.  i  wondered  where cohn  got  that  incapacity  to enjoy  paris.  possibly  from  mencken.  mencken  hates
paris, i believe. so many young men get their likes and dislikes from mencken.

the sort of healthy conceit that he had when he returned from america early in the spring was gone. then he

had been sure of his work, only with these personal longings for adventure. now the sureness was gone. somehow i
feel i have not shown robert cohn clearly. the reason is that until he fell in love with brett, i never heard him make
one remark that would, in any way, detach him from other people. he was nice to watch on the tennis-court, he had
a good body, and he kept it in shape; he handled his cards well at bridge, and he had a funny sort of undergraduate
quality about him. if he were in a crowd nothing he said stood out. he wore what used to be called polo shirts at

the ledoux-kid francis fight was the night of the 20th of june. it was a good fight. the morning after the

playing some golf and much bridge. hendaye had a splendid beach, but he was anxious to start on the fishing-trip.
when would i be down? if i would buy him a double-tapered line he would pay me when i came down.
that same morning i wrote cohn from the office that bill and i would leave paris on the 25th unless i wired

him otherwise, and would meet him at bayonne, where we could get a bus over the mountains to pamplona. th

 café. a breeze started to blow, and you could feel that
the air came from the sea. there were pigeons out in the square, and the houses were a yellow, sun-baked color, and
i did not want to leave the café. but we had to go to the hotel to get our bags packed and pay the bill. we paid for
the beers, we matched and i think cohn paid, and went up to the hotel. it was only sixteen francs apiece for bill and
me, with ten per cent added for the service, and we had the bags sent down and waited for robert cohn. while we
were waiting i saw a cockroach on the parquet floor that must have been at least three inches long. i pointed him out
to bill and then put my shoe on him. we agreed he must have just come in from the garden. it was really an awfully
clean hotel.

cohn came down, finally, and we all went out to the car. it was a big, closed car, with a driver in a white
duster with blue collar and cuffs, and we had him put the back of the car down. he piled in the bags and we started

and went over to the stream to see if there were any trout. bill tried to talk some spanish to one of the carabineers,
but it did not go very well. robert cohn asked, pointing with his finger, if there were any trout in the stream, and the

the left was a hill with an old castle, with buildings close around it and a field of grain going right up to the walls
and shifting in the wind. i was up in front with the driver and i turned around. robert cohn was asleep, but bill
looked and nodded his head. then we crossed a wide plain, and there was a big river off on the right shining in the
sun from between the line of trees, and away off you could see the plateau of pamplona rising out of the plain, and
the walls of the city, and the great brown cathedral, and the broken skyline of the other churches. in back of the

"i'm not sure they'll come," cohn said.
"why not?" bill said. "of course they'll come."

"i rather think they're not coming," robert cohn said.
he said it with an air of superior knowledge that irritated both of us.
"i'll bet you fifty pesetas they're here to-night," bill said. he always bets when he is angered, and so he usually

"i'll take it," cohn said. "good. you remember it, jake. fifty pesetas."
"i'll remember it myself," bill said. i saw he was angry and wanted to smooth him down.

"i'm satisfied," cohn said. he smiled. "you'll probably win it back at bridge, anyway."

down-stairs dining-room and we had a very good lunch. the first meal in spain was always a shock with the hors
d'ceuvres, an egg course, two meat courses, vegetables, salad, and dessert and fruit. you have to drink plenty of
wine to get it all down. robert cohn tried to say he did not want any of the second meat course, but we would not
interpret for him, and so the waitress brought him something else as a replacement, a plate of cold meats, i think.
cohn had been rather nervous ever since we had met at bayonne. he did not know whether we knew brett had been
with him at san sebastian, and it made him rather awkward.

at the end of the street i saw the cathedral and walked up toward it. the first time i ever saw it i thought the
facade was ugly but i liked it now. i went inside. it was dim and dark and the pillars went high up, and there were
people praying, and it smelt of incense, and there were some wonderful big windows. i knelt and started to pray and
prayed for everybody i thought of, brett and mike and bill and robert cohn and myself, and all the bull-fighters,
separately for the ones i liked, and lumping all the rest, then i prayed for myself again, and while i was praying for
myself i found i was getting sleepy, so i prayed that the bull-fights would be good, and that it would be a fine fiesta,
and that we would get some fishing. i wondered if there was anything else i might pray foi and i thought i would
like to have some money, so i prayed that i would make a lot of money, and then i started to think how i wo

and the thumb of my right hand were still damp, and i felt them dry in the sun. the sunlight was hot and hard, and i
crossed over beside some buildings, and walked back along sidestreets to the hotel.

at dinner that night we found that robert cohn had taken a bath, had had a shave and a haircut and a shampoo,
and something put on his hair afterward to make it stay down. he was nervous, and i did not try to help him any.
the train was due in at nine o'clock from san sebastian, and, if brett and mike were coming, they would be on it.
at twenty minutes to nine we were not half through dinner. robert cohn got up from the table and said he would go
to the station. i said i would go with him, just to devil him. bill said he would be damned if

station the train was late, and we sat on a baggage-truck and waited outside in the dark. i have never seen a man in
civil life as nervous as robert cohn--nor as eager. i was enjoying it. it was lousy to enjoy it, but i felt lousy. cohn
had a wonderful quality of bringing out the worst in anybody.

after a while we heard the train-whistle way off below on the other side of the plateau, and then we saw the
headlight coming up the hill. we went inside the station and stood with a crowd of people just back of the gates, and
the train came in and stopped, and everybody started coming out through the gates.

people were on top of the bus, and others were climbing up a ladder. bill went up and robert sat beside bill to save
a place for me, and i went back in the hotel to get a couple of bottles of wine to take with us. when i came out the
bus was crowded. men and women were sitting on all the baggage and boxes on top, and the women all had their
fans going in the sun. it certainiy was hot. robert climbed down and i fitted into the place he had saved on the one
wooden seat that ran across the top.

robert cohn stood in the shade of the arcade waiting for us to start. a basque with a big leather wine-bag in
his lap lay across the top of the bus in front of our seat, leaning back against our legs. he offered the wine-skin to
bill  and  to  me,  and  when  i  tipped  it  up  to  drink  he  imitated  the  sound  of  a  klaxon  motor-horn  so  well  and  so
suddenly that i spilled some of the wine, and everybody laughed. he apologized and made me take another drink.
he made the klaxon again a little later

bottles of wine. the man waved it away. he said it was too hot and he had drunk too much at lunch. when bill
offered the bottle the second time he took a long drink, and then the bottle went all over that part of the bus. every
one took a drink very politely, and then they made us cork it up and put it away. they all wanted us to drink from
their leather wine-bottles. they were peasants going up into the hills.

finally, after a couple more false klaxons, the bus started, and robert cohn waved good-by to us, and all the
basques waved goodby to him. as soon as we started out on the road outside of town it was cool. it felt nice riding
high up and close under the trees. the bus went quite fast and made a good breeze, and as we went out along the
road with the dust powdering the trees and down the hill, we had a fine view, back through the trees, of the town
rising up from the bluff above the river. the basque lying against my knees pointed out the view with the neck of

the coffee was good and we drank it out of big bowls. the girl brought in a glass dish of raspberry jam.
"thank you."
"hey! that's not the way," bill said. "say something ironical. make some crack about primo de rivera."
"i could ask her what kind of a jam they think they've gotten into in the riff."

he took a big gulp of coffee.

was always a breeze even in the heat of the day. it was hot enough so that it felt good to wade in a cold stream, and
the sun dried you when you came out and sat on the bank. we found a stream with a pool deep enough to swim in.
in the evenings we played three-handed bridge with an englishman named harris, who had walked over from saint
jean pied de port and was stopping at the inn for the fishing. he was very pleasant and went with us twice to the
irati river. there was no word from robert cohn nor from brett and mike.

"sure. sometimes they go right after them and kill them."
"can't the steers do anything?"
"no. they're trying to make friends."

brett was happy. mike had a way of getting an intensity of feeling into shaking hands. robert cohn shook

"i brought them up here," cohn said.
"what rot," brett said. "we'd have gotten here earlier if you hadn't come."
"you'd never have gotten here."
"what rot! you chaps are brown. look at bill."
"did you get good fishing?" mike asked. "we wanted to join you."
"it wasn't bad. we missed you."

two  lonely  looking  ticket-houses  standing  in  the  square.  their  windows,  marked  sol,  sol  y  sombra,  and

across the square the white wicker tables and chairs of the iruña extended out beyond the arcade to the edge

of the street. i looked for brett and mike at the tables. there they were. brett and mike and robert cohn. brett was

a single mule was hitched to one of the cages and dragged it up against the gate in the corral wall. the men
shoved and lifted it with crowbars into position against the gate. men were standing on the wall ready to pull up the

"that's too complicated," bill said. "don't you ever detach me from the herd, mike."
"i say," mike said, "they were fine bulls, weren't they? did you see their horns?"
"did i not," said brett. "i had no idea what they were like."
"did you see the one hit that steer?" mike asked. "that was extraordinary."
"it's no life being a steer," robert cohn said.

bill stood up and took hold of cohn.

i was reading a book by turgenieff. probably i read the same two pages over several times. it was one of the stories
in "a sportsman's sketches." i had read it before, but it seemed quite new. the country became very clear and the
feeling of pressure in my head seemed to loosen. i was very drunk and i did not want to shut my eyes because the
room would go round and round. if i kept on reading that feeling would pass.

i heard brett and robert cohn come up the stairs. cohn said good night outside the door and went on up to his
room. i heard brett go into the room next door. mike was already in bed. he had come in with me an hour before.
he woke as she came in, and they talked together. i heard them laugh. i turned off the light and tried to go to sleep.
it was not necessary to read any more. i could shut my eyes without getting the wheeling sensation. but i could not

in the evening was the paseo. for an hour after dinner every one, all the good-looking girls, the officers from
the garrison, all the fashionable people of the town, walked in the street on one side of the square while the café
tables filled with the regular after-dinner crowd.

during the morning i usually sat in the café and read the madrid papers and then walked in the town or out
into the country. sometimes bill went along. sometimes he wrote in his room. robert cohn spent the mornings
studying spanish or trying to get a shave at the barber-shop. brett and mike never got up until noon. we all had a
vermouth at the café. it was a quiet life and no one was drunk. i went to church a couple of times, once with brett.
she said she wanted to hear me go to confession, but i told her that not only was it impossible but it was not as
interesting as it sounded, and, besides, it would be in a language she did not know. we met cohn as we came out of
church, and althou

day of the starting of the fiesta of san fermin they had been in the wine-shops of the narrow
streets of the town since early morning. going down the streets in the morning on the way to mass in the cathedral, i
heard them singing through the open doors of the shops. they were warming up. there were many people at the
eleven o'clock mass. san fermin is also a religious festival.

i walked down the hill from the cathedral and up the street to the café on the square. it was a little before noon.
robert cohn and bill were sitting at one of the tables. the marble-topped tables and the white wicker chairs were
gone. they were replaced by cast-iron tables and severe folding chairs. the café was like a battleship stripped for
action.  today  the  waiters  did  not  leave  you  alone  all  morning  to  read  without  asking  if  you  wanted  to  order
something. a waiter came up as soon as i sat down.
"what are you drinking?" i asked bill and robert.

"sherry," cohn said.

"jerez," i said to the waiter

down  the  street  came  dancers.  the  street  was  solid  with  dancers,  all  men.  they  were  all  dancing  in  time
behind their own fifers and drummers. they were a club of some sort, and all wore workmen's blue smocks, and red
handkerchiefs around their necks, and carried a great banner on two poles. the banner danced up and down with
them as they came down surrounded by the crowd.




"hurray for wine! hurray for the foreigners!" was painted on the banner.
"where are the foreigners?" robert cohn asked.
"we're the foreigners," bill said.




all the time rockets were going up. the café tables were all full now. the square was emptying of people and


the crowd was filling the cafés.
"where's brett and mike?" bill asked.

"i'll go and get them," cohn said.

"bring them here."

up, the noise went on. the things that happened could only have happened during a fiesta. everythin

"no," said cohn, "what time is it?"
"it's ten o'clock."
"what a lot we've drunk."
"you mean what a lot _we've_ drunk. you went to sleep."
going down the dark streets to the hotel we saw the skyrockets going up in the square. down the side streets

"i don't know," mike said. "i'll ask. where is the drunken comrade?" he asked in spanish.

"you want to see him?"

"yes," i said.

"not me," said mike. "this gent."

the anis del mono man wiped his mouth and stood up.

"come on."

in a back room robert cohn was sleeping quietly on some wine-casks. it was almost too dark to see his face.

they had covered him with a coat and another coat was folded under his head. around his neck and on his chest
was a big wreath of twisted garlics.


the spaniards shouted when he came in. cohn wiped his eyes and grinned.


















that led to the square we saw the square solid with people, those in the centre all dancing.

edna started to laugh and could not stop.

"what kind of a row was it?" i asked edna. we were walking across the square to the suizo. bill was gone.
"i don't know what happened, but some one had the police called to keep mike out of the back room. there

at the café suizo we had just sat down and ordered fundador when robert cohn came up.
