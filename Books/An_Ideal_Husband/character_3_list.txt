Lord Goring - 
      Of impeccable dress and inimitable wit, Lord Goring is the play's thirty-something dandified philosopher, an idle aristocrat who serves as a thinly veiled double for Wilde himself. Irreverent, wry, and dangerously clever, Goring "plays with the world" and in doing so rejects ideals of duty, respectability, and responsibility. As with Wilde's other dandies, he functions as a figure for modern art of living and the aestheticist creed, particularly in his encounters with his stuffy father, Lord Caversham . Expounding a philosophy of love and forgiveness, Goring also figures as savior and helpmate to the Chilterns, teaching Lady Chiltern in particular of the dangers in idealizing one's husband. In terms of Wilde's other plays, Goring recalls the dandified Lord Illingworth in A Woman of No Importance.
