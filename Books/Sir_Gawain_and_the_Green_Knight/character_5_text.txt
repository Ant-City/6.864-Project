erly to destroy him. as the axe came
    gliding down gawayne "shrank a little with the shoulders from the sharp
    iron." the other withheld his weapon, and then reproved the prince with
    many proud words. "thou art not gawayne that is so good esteemed, that
    never feared for no host by hill nor by vale, for now thou fleest for
    fear before thou feelest harm (ll. 2247-2272). such cowardice of that
    knight did i never hear. i never flinched nor fled when thou didst aim
    at me in king arthur's house. my head flew to my feet and yet i never
    fled, wherefore i deserve to be called the better man."

    quoth gawayne, "i shunted once, but will do so no more, though my head
    fall on the stones. but hasten and bring me to the point; deal me my
    destiny, and do it out of hand, for i shall stand thee a stroke and
    start no more until thine axe has hit me--have here my troth." "have at
    thee, then," said the other, and heaves the axe aloft, and looks as
    savagely as if he

    his hand before the high table. she is even thine aunt, arthur's half
    sister; wherefore come to thine aunt, for all my household love thee."

    gawayne refuses to accompany the green knight, and so, with many
    embraces and kind wishes, they separate--the one to his castle, the
    other to arthur's court.

    after passing through many wild ways, our knight recovers from the
    wound in his neck, and at last comes safe and sound to the court of
    king arthur. great then was the joy of all; the king and queen kiss
    their brave knight, and make many enquiries about his journey. he tells
    them of his adventures, hiding nothing--"the chance of the chapel, the
    cheer of the knight, the love of the lady, and lastly of the lace."
    groaning for grief and shame he shows them the cut in his neck, which
    he had received for his unfaithfulness (ll. 2439-2504). the king and
    his courtiers comfort the knight--they laugh loudly at his adventures
