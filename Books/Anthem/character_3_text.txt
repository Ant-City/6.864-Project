nd at the trees and the earth. and when we cleaned
the yard of the home of the scholars, we gathered the glass vials, the
pieces of metal, the dried bones which they had discarded. we wished to
keep these things and to study them, but we had no place to hide them.
so we carried them to the city cesspool. and then we made the discovery.

it was on a day of the spring before last. we street sweepers work
in brigades of three, and we were with union 5-3992, they of the
half-brain, and with international 4-8818. now union 5-3992 are a sickly
lad and sometimes they are stricken with convulsions, when their
mouth froths and their eyes turn white. but international 4-8818
are different. they are a tall, strong youth and their eyes are like
fireflies, for there is laughter in their eyes. we cannot look upon
international 4-8818 and not smile in answer. for this they were not
liked in the home of the students, as it is not proper to smile without
reason. and also they were not liked because they too

and they drew pictures upon the walls, and they were pictures which made
men laugh. but it is only our brothers in the home of the artists who
are permitted to draw pictures, so international 4-8818 were sent to the
home of the street sweepers, like ourselves.

international 4-8818 and we are friends. this is an evil thing to say,
for it is a transgression, the great transgression of preference, to
love any among men better than the others, since we must love all men
and all men are our friends. so international 4-8818 and we have never
spoken of it. but we know. we know, when we look into each other's eyes.
and when we look thus without words, we both know other things also,
strange things for which there are no words, and these things frighten
us.

so on that d

ay of the spring before last, union 5-3992 were stricken
with convulsions on the edge of the city, near the city theatre. we
left them to lie in the shade of the theatre tent and we went with
international 4-8818 to finish our work. we came together to the great
ravine behind the theatre. it is empty save for trees and weeds.
beyond the ravine there is a plain, and beyond the plain there lies the
uncharted forest, about which men must not think.

we were gathering the papers and the rags which the wind had blown from
the theatre, when we saw an iron bar among the weeds. it was old and
rusted by many rains. we pulled with all our strength, but we could not
move it. so we called international 4-88

18, and together we scraped the
earth around the bar. of a sudden the earth fell in before us, and we
saw an old iron grill over a black hole.

international 4-8818 stepped back. but we pulled at the grill and it
gave way. and then we saw iron rings as steps leading down a shaft into
a darkness without bottom.

"we shall go down," we said to international 4-8818.

"it is forbidden," they answered.

we said: "the council does not know of this hole, so it cannot be
forbidden."

and they answered: "since the council does not know of this hole,
there can be no law permitting to enter it. and everything which is not
permitted by law is forbidden."

but we said: "we shall go, none the less."

they were frightened, but they stood by and watched us go.

we hung on the iron rings with our hands and our feet. we could see
nothing below us. and ab

so it was true, and those times had been, and all the wonders of those
times. hundreds upon hundreds of years ago men knew secrets which we
have lost. and we thought: "this is a foul place. they are damned
who touch the things of the unmentionable times." but our hand which
followed the track, as we crawled, clung to the iron as if it would not
leave it, as if the skin of our hand were thirsty and begging of the
metal some secret fluid beating in its coldness.

we returned to the earth. international 4-8818 looked upon us and
stepped back.

"equality 7-2521," they said, "your face is white."

but we could not speak and we stood looking upon them.

they backed away, as if they dared not touch us. then they smiled, but
it was not a gay smile; it was lost and pleading. but still we could not
speak. then they said:

"we shall report our find to the city council and both of us will be
rewarded."

and then we spoke. our voice was hard and there was no mercy in our
voice. we said:

"we s

hall not report our find to the city council. we shall not report
it to any men."

they raised their hands to their ears, for never had they heard such
words as these.

"international 4-8818," we asked, "will you report us to the council and
see us lashed to death before your eyes?"

they stood straight all of a sudden and they answered: "rather would we
die."

"then," we said, "keep silent. this place is ours. this place belongs
to us, equality 7-2521, and to no other men on earth. and if ever we
surrender it, we shall surrender our life with it also."

then we saw that the eyes of international 4-8818 were full to the
lids with tears they dared not drop. they whispered

of the street
sweepers. and we walked in silence.

thus did it come to pass that each night, when the stars are high and
the street sweepers sit in the city theatre, we, equality 7-2521, steal
out and run through the darkness to our place. it is easy to leave the
theatre; when the candles are blown out and the actors come onto the
stage, no eyes can see us as we crawl under our seat and under the cloth
of the tent. later, it is easy to steal through the shadows and fall in
line next to international 4-8818, as the column leaves the theatre. it
is dark in the streets and there are no men about, for no men may walk
through the city when they have no mission to walk there. each night, we
run to the ravine, and we remove the stones which we have piled upon the
iron grill to hide it from the men. each night, for three hours, we are
under the earth, alone.

we have stolen candles from the home of the street sweepers, we have
stolen flints and knives and paper, and we have brought them to this
