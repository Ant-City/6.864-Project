Hermia - 
                Egeus's
daughter, a young woman of Athens. Hermia is in love with Lysander
and is a childhood friend of Helena. As a result of the fairies'
mischief with Oberon's love potion, both Lysander and Demetrius suddenly
fall in love with Helena. Self-conscious about her short stature,
Hermia suspects that Helena has wooed the men with her height. By
morning, however, Puck has sorted matters out with the love potion,
and Lysander's love for Hermia is restored.
