bickering about a debt. “cinque
lire,” they had cried, “cinque lire!” they sparred at each other, and
one of them was hit lightly upon the chest. he frowned; he bent towards
lucy with a look of interest, as if he had an important message for her.
he opened his lips to deliver it, and a stream of red came out between
them and trickled down his unshaven chin.

that was all. a crowd rose out of the dusk. it hid this extraordinary
man from her, and bore him away to the fountain. mr. george emerson
happened to be a few paces away, looking at her across the spot where
the man had been. how very odd! across something. even as she caught
sight of him he grew dim; the palace itself grew dim, swayed above her,
fell on to her softly, slowly, noiselessly, and the sky fell with it.

she thought: “oh, what have i done?”

“oh, what have i done?” she murmured, and opened her eyes.

george emerson still looked at her, but not across anything. she had
complained of dullness, and lo!

“i shall want to live, i say.”

leaning her elbows on the parapet, she contemplated the river arno,
whose roar was suggesting some unexpected melody to her ears.



chapter v: possibilities of a pleasant outing

it was a family saying that “you never knew which way charlotte bartlett
would turn.” she was perfectly pleasant and sensible over lucy’s
adventure, found the abridged account of it quite adequate, and paid
suitable tribute to the courtesy of mr. george emerson. she and miss
lavish had had an adventure also. they had been stopped at the dazio
coming back, and the young officials there, who seemed impudent and
desoeuvre, had tried to search their reticules for provisions. it might
have been most unpleasant. fortunately miss lavish was a match for any
one.

for good or for evil, lucy was left to face her problem alone. none
of her friends had seen her, either in the piazza or, later on, by
the embankment. mr. beebe, indeed, noticing her startle

lucy fidgeted; it was tiresome of charlotte to have stopped exactly
where she did.

“look, lucia! oh, you are watching for the torre del gallo party. i
feared you would repent you of your choice.”

serious as the choice had been, lucy did not repent. yesterday had been
a muddle--queer and odd, the kind of thing one could not write down
easily on paper--but she had a feeling that charlotte and her shopping
were preferable to george emerson and the summit of the torre del
gallo. since she could not unravel the tangle, she must take care not
to re-enter it. she could protest sincerely against miss bartlett’s
insinuations.

but though she had avoided the chief actor, the scenery unfortunately
remained. charlotte, with the complacency of fate, led her from the
river to the piazza signoria. she could not have believed that stones, a
loggia, a fountain, a palace tower, would have such significance. for a
moment she understoo

lly towards her to catch her reply.

“practically.”

“one of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home,” said miss
bartlett, adroitly concealing the sex of the preserver.

“for her also it must have been a terrible experience. i trust that
neither of you was at all--that it was not in your immediate proximity?”

of the many things lucy was noticing to-day, not the least remarkable
was this: the ghoulish fashion in which respectable people will nibble
after blood. george emerson had kept the subject strangely pure.

“he died by the fountain, i believe,” was her reply.

“and you and your friend--”

“were over at the loggia.”

“that must have saved you much. you have not, of course, seen the
disgraceful illustrations which the gutter press--this man is a public
nuisance; he knows that i am a resident perfectly well, and yet he goes
on worrying me to buy his vulgar views.”

surely the vendor of photographs was in league with lucy--in the etern

i want. i’m sick of florence. no, you said you’d go to the ends of the
earth! do! do!”

miss bartlett, with equal vivacity, replied:

“oh, you droll person! pray, what would become of your drive in the
hills?”

they passed together through the gaunt beauty of the square, laughing
over the unpractical suggestion.



chapter vi: the reverend arthur beebe, the reverend cuthbert eager,
mr. emerson, mr. george emerson, miss eleanor lavish, miss charlotte
bartlett, and miss lucy honeychurch drive out in carriages to see a
view; italians drive them.

it was phaethon who drove them to fiesole that memorable day, a youth
all irresponsibility and fire, recklessly urging his master’s horses up
the stony hill. mr. beebe recognized him at once. neither the ages of
faith nor the age of doubt had touched him; he was phaethon in tuscany
driving a cab. and it was persephone whom he asked leave to pick up on

 the
indecorous proceeding, and continued his conversation with lucy. the
other two occupants of the carriage were old mr. emerson and miss
lavish. for a dreadful thing had happened: mr. beebe, without consulting
mr. eager, had doubled the size of the party. and though miss bartlett
and miss lavish had planned all the morning how the people were to sit,
at the critical moment when the carriages came round they lost their
heads, and miss lavish got in with lucy, while miss bartlett, with
george emerson and mr. beebe, followed on behind.

it was hard on the poor chaplain to have his partie carree thus
transformed. tea at a renaissance villa, if he had ever meditated it,
was now impossible. lucy and miss bartlett had a certain style about
them, and mr. beebe, though unreliable, was a man of parts. but a shoddy
lady writer and a journalist who had murdered his wife in the sight of
god--they should enter no villa at his introduction.

 only equalled by their desire to go different directions.
finally they split into groups. lucy clung to miss bartlett and miss
lavish; the emersons returned to hold laborious converse with the
drivers; while the two clergymen, who were expected to have topics in
common, were left to each other.

the two elder ladies soon threw off the mask. in the audible whisper
that was now so familiar to lucy they began to discuss, not alessio
baldovinetti, but the drive. miss bartlett had asked mr. george emerson
what his profession was, and he had answered “the railway.” she was very
sorry that she had asked him. she had no idea that it would be such a
dreadful answer, or she would not have asked him. mr. beebe had turned
the conversation so cleverly, and she hoped that the young man was not
very much hurt at her asking him.

“the railway!” gasped miss lavish. “oh, but i shall die! of course it
was the railway!” she could not control her mirth. “he is the image of a
porter--on, o

t’s toque, which cast monstrous and fantastic
shadows on the bolted door. a tram roared by in the dark, and lucy felt
unaccountably sad, though she had long since dried her eyes. she lifted
them to the ceiling, where the griffins and bassoons were colourless and
vague, the very ghosts of joy.

“it has been raining for nearly four hours,” she said at last.

miss bartlett ignored the remark.

“how do you propose to silence him?”

“the driver?”

“my dear girl, no; mr. george emerson.”

lucy began to pace up and down the room.

“i don’t understand,” she said at last.

she understood very well, but she no longer wished to be absolutely
truthful.

“how are you going to stop him talking about it?”

“i have a feeling that talk is a thing he will never do.”

“i, too, intend to judge him charitably. but unfortunately i have met
the type before. they seldom keep their exploits to themselves.”

“exploits?” cried lucy, wincing under the horrib

hes! eggs, boilers, hydrangeas,
maids--of such were their lives compact. “may me and lucy get down from
our chairs?” he asked, with scarcely veiled insolence. “we don’t want no
dessert.”



chapter xiv: how lucy faced the external situation bravely

of course miss bartlett accepted. and, equally of course, she felt sure
that she would prove a nuisance, and begged to be given an inferior
spare room--something with no view, anything. her love to lucy. and,
equally of course, george emerson could come to tennis on the sunday
week.

lucy faced the situation bravely, though, like most of us, she only
faced the situation that encompassed her. she never gazed inwards. if at
times strange images rose from the depths, she put them down to nerves.
when cecil brought the emersons to summer street, it had upset her
nerves. charlotte would burnish up past foolishness, and this might
upset her nerves. she was nervous at night. when she talked to
george--they met again almost immedia

 she remarked, when she returned.
“i promised you i shouldn’t. here is your money--all shillings, except
two half-crowns. would you count it? you can settle your debt nicely
now.”

miss bartlett was in the drawing-room, gazing at the photograph of st.
john ascending, which had been framed.

“how dreadful!” she murmured, “how more than dreadful, if mr. vyse
should come to hear of it from some other source.”

“oh, no, charlotte,” said the girl, entering the battle. “george emerson
is all right, and what other source is there?”

miss bartlett considered. “for instance, the driver. i saw him looking
through the bushes at you, remember he had a violet between his teeth.”

lucy shuddered a little. “we shall get the silly affair on our nerves
if we aren’t careful. how could a florentine cab-driver ever get hold of
cecil?”

“we must think of every possibility.”

“oh, it’s all right.”

“or perhaps old mr. emerson knows. in fact, he is certa

need she go?”--“tell
her, no nonsense”--“anne! mary! hook me behind!”--“dearest lucia, may i
trespass upon you for a pin?” for miss bartlett had announced that she
at all events was one for church.

the sun rose higher on its journey, guided, not by phaethon, but by
apollo, competent, unswerving, divine. its rays fell on the ladies
whenever they advanced towards the bedroom windows; on mr. beebe down
at summer street as he smiled over a letter from miss catharine alan; on
george emerson cleaning his father’s boots; and lastly, to complete the
catalogue of memorable things, on the red book mentioned previously. the
ladies move, mr. beebe moves, george moves, and movement may engender
shadow. but this book lies motionless, to be caressed all the morning
by the sun and to raise its covers slightly, as though acknowledging the
caress.

presently lucy steps out of the drawing-room window. her new cerise
dress has been a failure, and makes her look tawdry and wan. at her

ight. it’s a secret between
us two for ever. cecil will never hear.” she was even glad that miss
bartlett had made her promise secrecy, that last dark evening at
florence, when they had knelt packing in his room. the secret, big or
little, was guarded.

only three english people knew of it in the world. thus she interpreted
her joy. she greeted cecil with unusual radiance, because she felt so
safe. as he helped her out of the carriage, she said:

“the emersons have been so nice. george emerson has improved
enormously.”

“how are my proteges?” asked cecil, who took no real interest in them,
and had long since forgotten his resolution to bring them to windy
corner for educational purposes.

“proteges!” she exclaimed with some warmth. for the only relationship
which cecil conceived was feudal: that of protector and protected. he
had no glimpse of the comradeship after which the girl’s soul yearned.

“you shall see for yourself how your proteges are. george emers

 for you.
what’s wanted is a man with a whip.”

miss bartlett agreed: one wanted a man with a whip.

“yes--but it’s no good agreeing. what’s to be done. we women go
maundering on. what does a girl do when she comes across a cad?”

“i always said he was a cad, dear. give me credit for that, at all
events. from the very first moment--when he said his father was having a
bath.”

“oh, bother the credit and who’s been right or wrong! we’ve both made a
muddle of it. george emerson is still down the garden there, and is he
to be left unpunished, or isn’t he? i want to know.”

miss bartlett was absolutely helpless. her own exposure had unnerved
her, and thoughts were colliding painfully in her brain. she moved
feebly to the window, and tried to detect the cad’s white flannels among
the laurels.

“you were ready enough at the bertolini when you rushed me off to rome.
can’t you speak again to him now?”

“willingly would i move heaven and earth--”

ope he won’t go gossiping.”

so she did want to talk about her broken engagement. always complaisant,
he put the letter away. but she, at once exclaimed in a high voice, “oh,
do tell me more about the miss alans! how perfectly splendid of them to
go abroad!”

“i want them to start from venice, and go in a cargo steamer down the
illyrian coast!”

she laughed heartily. “oh, delightful! i wish they’d take me.”

“has italy filled you with the fever of travel? perhaps george emerson
is right. he says that ‘italy is only an euphuism for fate.’”

“oh, not italy, but constantinople. i have always longed to go to
constantinople. constantinople is practically asia, isn’t it?”

mr. beebe reminded her that constantinople was still unlikely, and that
the miss alans only aimed at athens, “with delphi, perhaps, if the roads
are safe.” but this made no difference to her enthusiasm. she had always
longed to go to greece even more, it seemed. he saw, to his sur

“you know, lucy, you and charlotte and mr. beebe all tell me i’m
so stupid, so i suppose i am, but i shall never understand this
hole-and-corner work. you’ve got rid of cecil--well and good, and i’m
thankful he’s gone, though i did feel angry for the minute. but why not
announce it? why this hushing up and tip-toeing?”

“it’s only for a few days.”

“but why at all?”

lucy was silent. she was drifting away from her mother. it was quite
easy to say, “because george emerson has been bothering me, and if he
hears i’ve given up cecil may begin again”--quite easy, and it had
the incidental advantage of being true. but she could not say it. she
disliked confidences, for they might lead to self-knowledge and to that
king of terrors--light. ever since that last evening at florence she had
deemed it unwise to reveal her soul.

mrs. honeychurch, too, was silent. she was thinking, “my daughter won’t
answer me; she would rather be with those inquisitive old
