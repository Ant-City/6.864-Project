    whereat fair proserpine began to smile,
    and begg'd that only she might give me doom.
    pluto was pleas'd, and seal'd it with a kiss.
    forthwith, revenge, she rounded thee in th' ear,
    and bad thee lead me though the gates of horn,
    where dreams have passage in the silent night.
    no sooner had she spoke but we were here,
    i wot not how, in the twinkling of an eye.

  revenge.  then know, andrea, that thou arriv'd
    where thou shalt see the author of thy death,
    don balthazar, the prince of portingal,
    depriv'd of life by bel-imperia:
    here sit we down to see the mystery,
    and serve for chorus in this tragedy.

                enter spanish king, general, castille, hieronimo.

  king.  now say, lord general: how fares our camp?

  gen.  all well, my sovereign liege, except some few
    that are deceas'd by fortune of the war.

    and soldiers, some ill-maim'd, some slain outright:
    here falls a body sunder'd from his head;
    there legs and arms lie bleeding on the grass,
    mingled with weapons and unbowel'd steeds,
    that scattering over-spread the purple plain.
    in all this turmoil, three long hours and more
    the victory to neither part inclin'd,
    till don andrea with his brave lancers
    in their main battle made so great a breach
    that, half dismay'd, the multitude retir'd.
    but balthazar, the portingales' young prince,
    brought rescue and encourag'd them to stay.
    here-hence the fight was eagerly renew'd,
    and in that conflict was andrea slain,--
    brave man-at-arms, but weak to balthazar.
    yet, while the prince, insulting over him,
    breath'd out proud vaunts, sounding to our reproach,
    friendship and hardy valour join'd in one
    prick'd forth horatio, our knight-marshall's son,
    to challenge forth that prince in single fight.

    what means this warning of this trumpet's sound?

  gen.  this tells me that your grace's men of war,
    such as war's fortune hath reserv'd from death,
    come marching on towards your royal seat,
    to show themselves before your majesty;
    for so gave i in charge at my depart.
    whereby by demonstration shall appear
    that all, except three hundred or few more,
    are safe return'd and by their foes enrich'd.

                  the army enters, balthazar between lorenzo
                  and horatio, captive.

  king.  a gladsome sight!  i long to see them here.

                  they enter and pass by.

    that by our nephew was in triumph led?

    held him by th' arm as partner of the prize?

    by virtue of thy worthy son's exploit.

    bring hither the young prince of portingal!
    the rest march on, but, ere they be dismiss'd,
    we will bestow on every soldier
    two ducats, and on every leader ten,
    that they may know our largesse welcomes them.

                  exeunt all [the army] but bal[thazar],
                  lor[enzo], and hor[atio].

  king.  welcome, don balthazar!  welcome nephew!
    and thou, horatio, thou art welcome too!
    young prince, although thy father's hard misdeeds
    in keeping back the tribute that he owes
    deserve but evil measure at our hands,
    yet shalt thou know that spain is honourable.

  balt.  the trespass that my father made in peace
    is now controll'd by fortune of the wars;
    and cards once dealt, it boots not ask why so.
    his men are slain,--a weakening to his realm;
    his colours seiz'd,--a blot unto his name

;
    his son distress'd,--a corsive to his heart;
    these punishments may clear his late offence.

  king.  aye, balthazar, if he observe this truce,
    our peace will grow the stronger for these wars.
    meanwhile live thou, though not in liberty,
    yet free from bearing any servile yoke;
    for in our hearing thy deserts were great.
    and in our sight thyself art gracious.

  balt.  and i shall study to deserve this grace.

  king.  but tell me,--for their holding makes me doubt:
    to which of these twain art thou prisoner?

    horatio, thou did'st force him first to yield:
    his ransom therefore is thy valour's fee;
    appoint the sum as you shall both agree.
    but, nephew, thou shalt have the prince in guard,
    for thine estate best fitteth such a guest;
    horatio's house were small for all his train.
    yet, in regard thy substance passeth his,
    and that just guerdon may befall desert,
    to him we yield the armour of the prince.
    how likes don balthazar of this device?

  balt.  right well, my liege, if this proviso were:
    that don horatio bear us company,
    whom i admire and love for chivalry.

  king.  horatio, leave him not that loves thee so.
    now let us hence, to see our soldiers paid,
    and feast our prisoner as our friendly guest.

                  exeunt.

  vice.  speak on; i'll guerdon thee, whate'er it be.
    mine ear is ready to receive ill news,
    my heart grown hard 'gainst mischief's battery;
    stand up, i say, and tell thy tale at large.

  villup.  then hear that truth which these mine eyes have seen:
    when both the armies were in battle join'd.
    don balthazar amidst the thickest troops,
    to win renown, did wondrous feats of arms;
    amongst the rest i saw him hand-to-hand
    in single fight with their lord general.
    till alexandro, that here counterfeits
    under the colour of a duteous friend,
    discharg'd a pistol at the princes back,
    as though he would have slain their general,
    but therewithal don balthazar fell down;
    and when he fell, then we began to fly;
    but, had he liv'd, the day had sure been ours.

  vice.  aye, aye, my nightly dreams have told me this!
    thou false, unkind, unthankful, traitorous beast!
    wherein had balthazar offended thee,
    that thou should betray him to our foes?
    was't spanish gold that bleared so thine eyes
    that thou couldst see no part of our deserts?
    perchance, because thou art terserae's lord,
    thou hadst some hope to wear this diadem
    if first my son and then myself were slain;
    but thy ambitious thought shall break thy neck.

    wherein i must entreat thee to relate
    the circumstan

ce of don andrea's death,
    who living was my garland's sweetest flower,
    and in his death hath buried my delights.

  hor.  for love of him and service to yourself,
    i'll not refuse this heavy doleful charge;
    yet tears and sighs, i fear, will hinder me.
    when both our armies were enjoin'd in fight,
    your worthy cavalier amidst the thickest,
    for glorious cause still aiming at the fairest,
    was at the last by young don balthazar
    encounter'd hand-to-hand.  their fight was long,
    their hearts were great, their clamours menacing,
    their strength alike, their strokes both dangerous;
    but wrathful nemesis, that wicked power,
    envying at andrea's praise and worth,
    cut short his life to end his praise and worth.
    she, she herself, disguis'd in armour's mask,
    as pallas was before proud pergamus,
    brought in a fresh supply of halberdiers,
    which punch'd his horse and ding'd him to the ground.

  then young don balthazar, with ruthless rage,
    taking advantage of his foe's distress,
    did finish what his halberdiers begun;
    and left not till andrea's life was done.
    then, though too late, incens'd with just remorse,
    i with my band set forth against the prince,
    and brought him prisoner from his halberdiers.

  bel.  would thou hadst slain him that so slew my love!
    but then was don andrea's carcass lost?

  hor.  no; that was it for which i chiefly strove,
    nor stepp'd i back till i recov

ave me here alone,
    for solitude best fits my cheerless mood.--
    yet what avails to wail andreas death,
    from whence horatio proves my second love?
    had he not lov'd andrea as he did,
    he could not sit in bel-imperia's thoughts.
    but how can love find harbour in my breast,
    till i revenge the death of my belov'd?
    yes, second love shall further my revenge:
    i'll love horatio, my andrea's friend,
    the more to spite the prince that wrought his end;
    and, where don balthazar, that slew my love,
    himself now pleads for favor at my hands,
    he shall, in rigour of my just disdain,
    reap long repentance for his murderous deed,--
    for what was't else but murderous cowardice,
    so many to oppress one valiant knight,
    without respect of honour in the fight?
    and here he comes that murder'd my delight.

                enter lorenzo and balthazar.

    things were in readiness before i came.

  bal.  then here it fits us to attend the king,
    to welcome hither our ambassador,
    and learn my father and my country's health.

                enter the banquet, trumpets, the king,
                and ambassador.

  king.  see, lord ambassador, how spain entreats
    their prisoner balthazar, thy viceroy's son:
    we pleasure more in kindness than in wars.

  ambass.  sad is our king, and portingal laments,
    supposing that don balthazar is slain.

  bal. [aside]  so am i, slain by beauty's tyranny!--
    you see, my lord, how balthazar is slain:
    i frolic with the duke of castille's son,
    wrapp'd every hour in pleasures of the court,
    and grac'd with favours of his majesty.

    i'll turn their friendship into fell despite,
    their love to mortal hate, their day to night,
    their hope into despair, their peace to war,
    their joys to pain, their bliss to misery.

  lorenzo.  my lord, though bel-imperia seem thus coy,
    let reason hold you in your wonted joy:
    in time the savage bull sustains the yoke,
    in time all haggard hawks will stoop to lure,
    in time small wedges cleave the hardest oak,
    in time the flint is pierc'd with softest shower;
    and she in time will fall from her disdain,
    and rue the sufferance of your friendly pain.

    then beast or bird, or tree or stony wall!

    and shield thee from whatever can ensue,

    why, so, tam armis quam ingenio:

    but gold doth more than either of them both.
    how likes prince balthazar this stratagem?

  bal.  both well and ill; it makes me glad and sad:
    glad, that i know the hind'rer of my love;
    sad, that i fear she hates me whom i love;
    glad, that i know on whom to be reveng'd;
    sad, that she'll fly me if i take revenge.
    yet must i take revenge or die myself;
    for love resisted grows impatient.

    a letter for hieronimo.

    me hath my hapless brother hid from thee.
    revenge thyself on balthazar and him,
    for these were they that murdered thy son.
    hieronimo, revenge horatio's death,
    and better fare then bel-imperia doth!"--
    what means this unexpected miracle?
    my son slain by lorenzo and the prince?
    what cause had they horatio to malign?
    or what might move thee, bel-imperia,
    to accuse thy brother, had he been the mean?
    hieronimo, beware!  thou art betray'd,
    and to entrap thy life this train is laid.
    advise thee therefore, be not credulous:

    in person, therefore, will be come himself
    to see the marriage rites solemnized
    and in the presence of the court of spain
    to knit a sure inextricable band
    of kingly love and everlasting league
    betwixt the crowns of spain and portingal.
    there will he give his crown to balthazar,

  king.  brother, how like you this our viceroy's love?

    this is the love that fathers bear their sons.

    the prince's ransom; let him have his due;

                he giveth him a book.

[gentlemen, this play of hieronimo in sundry languages was thought
good to be set down in english more largely, for the easier
understanding to every publique reader.]

                enter balthazar, bel-imperia, and
                hieronimo.

  balthazar. [acting]  bashaw, that rhodes is ours yield
    heav'ns the honour
    and holy mahomet, our sacred prophet!
    and be thou grac'd with every excellence
    that suleiman can give or thou desire!
    but thy desert in conquering rhodes is less
    then in reserving this fair christian nymph,
    perseda, blissful lamp of excellence,
    whose eyes compel, like powerful adamant,
    the warlike heart of suleiman to wait.

  king.  see,

viceroy, that is balthazar your son,
    that represents the emperor suleiman:
    how well he acts his amorous passion!

  vice.  aye; bel-imperia hath taught him that.

  castile:  that's because his mind runs all on bel-imperia.

  hiero. [acting]  whatever joy earth yields betide your majesty!

  balt. [acting]  earth yields no joy without perseda's love.

  hiero. [acting]  let then perseda on your grace attend.

    here lay my hope, and here my hope hath end;
    here lay my heart, and here my heart was slain;
    here lay my treasure, here my treasure lost;
    here lay my bliss, and here my bliss bereft.
    but hope, heart, treasure, joy and bliss,--
    all fled, fail'd, died, yea, all decay'd with this.
    from forth these wounds came breath that gave me life;
    they murder'd me that made these fatal marks.
    the cause was love whence grew this mortal hate:
    the hate, lorenzo and young balthazar;
    the love, my son to bel-imperia.
    but night, the cov'rer of accursed crimes,
    with pitchy silence hush'd these traitors' harms,
    and lent them leave--for they had sorted leisure--
    to take advantage in my garden plot
    upon my son, my dear horatio.
    there merciless they butcher'd up my boy,
    in black, dark night, to pale, dim, cruel death!
    he shrieks; i heard--and yet, methinks, i hear--
    his dismal out-cry echo in the air;
    with soonest speed i hasted to the

noise,
    where, hanging on a tree, i found my son
    through-girt with wounds and slaughter'd, as you see.
    and griev'd i, think you, at this spectacle?
    speak, portuguese, whose loss resembles mine!
    if thou canst weep upon thy balthazar,
    'tis like i wail'd for my horatio.
    and you, my lord, whose reconciled son
    march'd in a net and thought himself unseen,
    and rated me for a brainsick lunacy,
    with "god amend that mad hieronimo!"--
    how can you brook our play's catastrophe?
    and here behold this bloody handkerchief,
    which at horatio's death i weeping dipp'd
    within the river of his bleeding wounds!
    it as propitious, see, i have reserv'd,
    and never hath it left my bloody heart,

ng remembrance of my vow
    with these, o these accursed murderers!
    which now perform'd, my heart is satisfied.
    and to this end the bashaw i became,
    that might revenge me on lorenzo's life,
    who therefore was appointed to the part
    and was to represent the knight of rhodes,
    that i might kill him more conveniently.
    so, viceroy, was this balthazar thy son--
    that suleiman which bel-imperia
    in person of perseda murdered,--
    solely appointed to that tragic part,
    that she might slay him that offended her.
    poor bel-imperia miss'd her part in this:
    for, though the story saith she should have died,
    yet i, of kindness and of care for her,
    did otherwise determine of her end.
    but love of him whom they did hate too much
    did urge her resolution to be such.
    and princes, now behold hieronimo,
    author and a

    bearing his latest fortune in his fist;
    and will as resolute conclude his part
    as any of the actors gone before.
    and, gentles, thus i end my play!
    urge no more words, i have no more to say.

                he runs to hang himself.

  king.  o hearken, viceroy; hold hieronimo!
    brother, my nephew and thy son are slain!

  vice.  we are betray'd!  my balthazar is slain!
    break ope the doors; run save hieronimo!
    hieronimo, do but inform the king of these events;
    upon mine honour, thou shalt have no harm!

  hiero.  viceroy, i will not trust thee with my life,
    which i this day have offer'd to my son:
    accursed wretch, why stayst thou him that was resolv'd to die?

  king.  speak, traitor!  damned, bloody murd'rer, speak!--
    for, now i have thee, i will make thee speak!
    why hast thou done this undeserving deed?

  cas.  why hast thou butcher'd both my children thus?

  hiero.  o good words!  as dear to me was horatio
    as yours, or yours, my lord, to you.
    my guiltless son was by lorenzo slain;
    and by lorenzo and that balthazar
    am i at last revenged thoroughly,--
    upon whose souls may heav'n be yet aveng'd
    with greater far than these afflictions!

  cas.  but who were thy confederates in this?

  vice.  that was thy daughter bel-imperia;
    for by her hand my balthazar was slain,--
    i saw her stab him.

  king.         why speak'st thou not?

  hiero.  what lesser liberty can kings afford
    than harmless silence?  then afford it me!
    sufficeth i may not nor i will not tell thee.

    that he may be entomb'd. whate'er befall,

  vice.  and thou, don pedro, do the like for us:
    take up our hapless son untimely slain;
    set me up with him, and he with woeful me,
    upon the main-mast of a ship unmann'd,
    and let the wind and tide hale me along
    to scylla's barking and untamed gulf
    or to the loathsome pool of acheron,
    to weep my want for my sweet balthazar.
    spain hath no refuge for a portingale!

                the trumpets sound a dead march, the king of spain
                mourning after his brother's body, and the king of
                portingal bearing the body of his son.

                enter ghost and revenge.

  ghost.  aye; now my hopes have end in their effects,
    when blood and sorrow finish my desires:
    horatio murder'd in his father's bower,
    vile serberine by pedrigano slain,
    false pedrigano hang'd

by quaint device,
    fair isabella by herself misdone,
    prince balthazar by bel-imperia stabb'd,
    the duke of castile and his wicked son
    both done to death by old hieronimo,
    my bel-imperia fallen as dido fell,
    and good hieronimo slain by himself!
    aye, these were spectacles to please my soul.
    now will i beg at lovely proserpine
    that, by the virtue of her princely doom,
    i may consort my friends in pleasing sort,
    and on my foes work just and sharp revenge.
    i'll lead my friend horatio through those fields
    where never-dying wars

e,--
    against the rest how shall my hate be shown?

  revenge.  this hand shall hale them down to deepest hell,
    where none but furies, bugs and tortures dwell.

  ghost.  then, sweet revenge, do this at my request:
    let me judge and doom them to unrest;
    let loose poor titius from the vulture's gripe,
    and let don ciprian supply his room;
    place don lorenzo on ixion's wheel,
    and let the lovers' endless pains surcease,
    juno forget old wrath and grant him ease;
    hang balthazar about chimera's neck,
    and let him there bewail his bloody love,
    repining at our joys that are above;
    let serberine go roll the fatal stone
    and take from sisyphus his endless moan;
    false pedringano, for his treachery,
    let him be dragg'd through boiling acheron,
    and there live dying still in endless flames,
    blaspheming gods and all their holy names.

  revenge.  then haste we down to meet thy friends and foes;
    to place thy friends in ease, the rest in woes.
