ould please rather than pain her if this
somewhat bouncing, breathless and exigent idealism would
focus on something except herself.
‘then you like it here?’ she asked.
‘it might be fun if we knew those people. there were some
other people, but they weren’t nice. they recognized me—
no matter where we go everybody’s seen ‘daddy’s girl.’’
mrs. speers waited for the glow of egotism to subside;
then she said in a matter-of-fact way: ‘that reminds me,
when are you going to see earl brady?’
‘i thought we might go this afternoon—if you’re rested.’
‘you go—i’m not going.’
‘we’ll wait till to-morrow then.’
‘i want you to go alone. it’s only a short way—it isn’t as if
you didn’t speak french.’
‘mother—aren’t there some things i don’t have to do?’
‘oh, well then go later—but some day before we leave.’
‘all right, mother.’
after lunch they were both overwhelmed by the sudden
flatness that comes over american travellers in quiet f

speck, or late blight.’ he pointed his forefinger decisively at
rosemary, saying with a lightness seeming to conceal a paternal
interest, ‘i’m going to save your reason—i’m going to
give you a hat to wear on the beach.’
he turned them from the garden to the terrace, where he
poured a cocktail. earl brady arrived, discovering rosemary
with surprise. his manner was softer than at the studio, as if
his differentness had been put on at the gate, and rosemary,
comparing him instantly with dick diver, swung sharply
toward the latter. in comparison earl brady seemed faintly
gross, faintly ill-bred; once more, though, she felt an electric
response to his person.
he spoke familiarly to the children who were getting up
from their outdoor supper.

to have been friendly and interested would have seemed to
reflect on the divers, so now they were all trying, and seeing
this, rosemary liked everyone—except mckisco, who had
contrived to be the unassimilated member of the party. this
was less from ill will than from his determination to sustain
with wine the good spirits he had enjoyed on his arrival. lying
back in his place between earl brady, to whom he had
addressed several withering remarks about the movies, and
mrs. abrams, to whom he said nothing, he stared at dick
diver with an expression of devastating irony, the effect being
occasionally interrupted by his attempts to engage dick
in a cater-cornered conversation across the table.
‘aren’t you a friend of van buren denby?’ he would say.
‘i don’t believe i know him.’
‘i thought you were a friend of his,’ he persisted irritably.

nicole disappeared and presently rosemary noticed that
dick was no longer there; the guests distributed themselves
in the garden or drifted in toward the terrace.
‘do you want,’ violet mckisco asked rosemary, ‘to go to
the bathroom?’
not at that precise moment.
‘i want,’ insisted mrs. mckisco, ‘to go to the bathroom.’
as a frank outspoken woman she walked toward the house,
dragging her secret after her, while rosemary looked after
with reprobation. earl brady proposed that they walk down
to the sea wall but she felt that this was her time to have a
share of dick diver when he reappeared, so she stalled, listening
to mckisco quarrel with barban.
‘why do you want to fight the soviets?’ mckisco said.
‘the greatest experiment ever made by humanity? and the
riff? it seems to me it would be more heroic to fight on the
just side.’

‘how do you find out which it is?’ asked barban dryly.

his laughter swept them on up toward the terrace where
he delivered her to nicole... .
too soon it had become time to go and the divers helped
them all to go quickly. in the divers’ big isotta there would
be tommy barban and his baggage—he was spending the
night at the hotel to catch an early train—with mrs. abrams,
the mckiscos and campion. earl brady was going to drop
rosemary and her mother on his way to monte carlo, and
royal dumphry rode with them because the divers’ car was

crowded. down in the garden lanterns still glowed over the
table where they had dined, as the divers stood side by side
in the gate, nicole blooming away and filling the night with
graciousness, and dick bidding good-by to everyone by
name. to rosemary it seemed very poignant to drive away
and leave them in their house. again she wondered wh

he got up and walked swiftly away; abe sat down beside
rosemary.
‘why did you treat him so badly?’
‘did i?’ he asked surprised. ‘he’s been weeping around
here all morning.’
‘well, maybe he’s sad about something.’
‘maybe he is.’
‘what about a duel? who’s going to duel? i thought there
was something strange in that car. is it true?’
‘it certainly is coo-coo but it seems to be true.’

the trouble began at the time earl brady’s car passed the
divers’ car stopped on the road—abe’s account melted impersonally
into the thronged night—violet mckisco was
telling mrs. abrams something she had found out about
the divers—she had gone upstairs in their house and she
had come upon something there which had made a great
impression on her. but tommy is a watch-dog about the
divers. as a matter of fact she is inspiring and formidable—
but it’s a mutual thing, and the fact of the divers together is
