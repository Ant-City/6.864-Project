the [CHARACTER] - 
 three "black and midnight hags" who plot mischief
against macbeth using charms, spells, and prophecies. their predictions
prompt him to murder duncan, to order the deaths of banquo and his
son, and to blindly believe in his own immortality. the play leaves
the witches' true identity unclear--aside from the fact that they
are servants of hecate, we know little about their place in the
cosmos. in some ways they resemble the mythological fates, who impersonally weave
the threads of human destiny. they clearly take a perverse delight
in using their knowledge of the future to toy with and destroy human
beings.
