the unvanquished
ambuscade 

behind the smokehouse that summer, ringo and i had a living map. although vicksburg
was just a handful of chips from the woodpile and the river a trench scraped into the
packed earth with the point of a hoe, it (river, city, and terrain) lived, possessing even, in
miniature that ponderable though passive recalcitrance of topography which outweighs
artillery, against which the most brilliant of victories and the most tragic of defeats are but
the loud noises of a moment. to ringo and me it lived, if only because of the fact that the

me, before we could engender between us and hold intact the pattern of re-capitulant
mimic furious victory like a cloth, a shield between ourselves and reality, between us and
fact and doom. this afternoon it seemed as if we would never get it filled, wet enough,
since there had not even been dew in three weeks. but at last it was damp enough,
damp-colored enough at least, and we could begin. we were just about to begin. then
suddenly loosh was standing there, watching us. he was joby's son and ringo's uncle; he
stood there (we did not know where he had come from; we had not seen him appear,
emerge) in the fierce dull early afternoon sunlight, bareheaded, his head slanted a little,
tilted a little yet firm and not askew, like a cannonball (which it resembled) bedded
hurriedly and carelessly in concrete, his eyes a little red at the inner corners as negroes'
eyes get when they have been drinking, looking down at what ringo and i called
vicksburg. then i saw philadelphy, his wife, over at the

"loosh!" philadelphy said. but loosh squatted, looking at me with that expression on

"vicksburg," i said.

loosh laughed. he stood there laughing, not loud, looking at the chips.


"come on here, loosh," philadelphy said from the woodpile. there was something
curious in her voice too--urgent, perhaps frightened. "if you wants any supper, you better
tote me some wood." but i didn't know which, urgency or fright; i didn't have time to
wonder or speculate, because suddenly loosh stooped before ringo or i could have
moved, and with his hand he swept the chips flat.

toward us. "that's in mississippi too. that's not far. i've been there."

"far don't matter," loosh said. now he sounded as if he were about to chant, to
sing; squatting there with the fierce dull sun on his iron skull and the flattening slant of his
nose, he was not looking at me or ringo either; it was as if his red-cornered eyes had

ruined vicksburg, our tedious hoe-scratch not even damp-colored now, looking at one
another quietly. "what?" ringo said. "what he mean?"


laughed at corinth too. what you reckon he know that we ain't?"
"nothing!" i said. "do you reckon loosh knows anything that father don't know?"

"marse john at tennessee. maybe he ain't know either."


"do you reckon he'd be away off at tennessee if there were yankees at corinth?
do you reckon that if there were yankees at corinth, father and general van dorn and
general pemberton all three wouldn't be there too?" but i was just talking too, i knew that,
because niggers

know, they know things; it would have to be something louder, much
louder, than words to do any good. so i stooped and caught both hands full of dust and
rose: and ringo still standing there, not moving, just looking at me even as i flung the dust.
"i'm general pemberton!" i cried. "yaaay! yaay!" stooping and catching up more dust and
flinging that too. still ringo didn't move. "all right!" i cried. "i'll be grant this time, then. you
can be general pemberton." because it was that urgent, since negroes knew. the
arrangement was that i would be general pemberton twice in succession and ringo
would be grant, then i would have to be grant once so ringo could be general
pemberton or he wouldn't play anymore. but now it was that urgent even though ringo

fed at the same breast and had slept together and eaten together for so long that ringo
called granny 'granny' just like i did, until maybe he wasn't a nigger anymore or maybe i
wasn't a white boy anymore, the two of us neither, not even people any longer: the two
supreme undefeated like two moths, two feathers riding above a hurricane. so we were
both at it; we didn't see louvinia, joby's wife and ringo's grandmother, at all. we were
facing one another at scarcely arms' length, to the other each invisible in the furious slow
jerking of the flung dust, yelling "kill the bastuds! k

seemed to descend upon us like an enormous hand, flattening the very dust which we
had raised, leaving us now visible to one another, dust-colored ourselves to the eyes and
still in the act of throwing:
"you, bayard! you, ringo!" she stood about ten feet away, her mouth still open with

shouting. i noticed that she did not now have on the old hat of father's which she wore on
top of her head rag even when she just stepped out of the kitchen for wood. "what was
that word?" she said. "what did i hear you say?" only she didn't wait to be answered, and
then i saw that she had been running too. "look who coming up the big road!" she said.

where loosh had just come around the house from the other side and stopped, looking
down the drive toward the gate. in the spring, when father came home that time, ringo
and i ran down the drive to meet him and return, i standing in one stirrup with father's arm
around me, and ringo holding to the other stirrup and running beside the horse. but this
time we didn't. i mounted the steps and stood beside granny, and with ringo and loosh
on the ground below the gallery we watched the claybank stallion enter the gate which
was never closed now, and come up the drive. we watched them--the big gaunt horse
almost the color of smoke, lighter in color than the dust which had gathered and caked
on his wet hide where they had crossed at the ford three miles away, coming up the drive

the skirts of his weathered gray coat shades darker than the breast and back and sleeves
where the tarnished buttons and the frayed braid of his field officer's rank glinted dully, the
sabre hanging loose yet rigid at his side as if it were too heavy to jounce or perhaps were
attached to the living thigh itself and took no more motion from the horse than he did. he
stopped; he looked at granny and me on the porch and at ringo and loosh on the
ground. "well, miss rosa," he said. "well, boys." "well, john," granny said. loosh came and
took jupiter's head; father dismounted stiffly, the sabre clashing dully and heavily against
his wet boot and leg. "curry him," father said. "give him a good feed, but don't turn him
into the pasture. let him stay in the lot. . . . go with loosh," he said, as if jupiter were a
child, slapping him on the flank as loosh led him on. then we could see him good. i mean,

of him, because jupiter was big and when you thought of father you thought of him as
being big too and so when you thought of father being on jupiter it was as if you said.

that afternoon we built the stock pen. we built it deep in the creek bottom, where you
could not have found it unless you had known where to look, and you could not have
seen it until you came to the new sap-sweating, axe-ended rails woven through and into
the jungle growth itself. we were all there--father and joby and ringo and loosh and me--
father in the boots still but with his coat off now, so that we saw for the first time that his
trousers were not confederate ones but were yankee ones, of new strong blue cloth,
which they (he and his troop) had captured, and without the sabre now too. we worked
fast, felling the saplings--the willow and pin oak, the swamp maple and chinkapin--and,
without even waiting hardly to trim them, dragging them behind the mules and by hand
too, through the mud and the briers to wher

and finished the side meat and greens and the cornbread and milk which louvinia
brought him (and we watching and waiting, ringo and i at least, waiting for night and the

same vision. there would be all of us there--joby and loosh and ringo and me on the
edge of the bottom and drawn up into a kind of order--an order partaking not of any
lusting and sweating for assault or even victory, but rather of that passive yet dynamic
affirmation which napoleon's troops must have felt--and facing us, between us and the
bottom, between us and the waiting sap-running boles which were about to be
transposed into dead rails, father. he was on jupiter now; he wore the frogged gray field-
officer's tunic; and while we watched he drew the sabre. gi

chosen saplings, sheared trimmed and lopped, sprang into neat and waiting windrows,
requiring only the carrying and the placing to become a fence. the sun had gone out of
the bottom when we finished the fence, that is, left joby and loosh with the last three
panels to put up, but it was still shining up the slope of the pasture when we rode across it, i
behind father on one of the mules and ringo on the other one. but it was gone even from
the pasture by the time i had left father at the house and returned to the stable, where
ringo already had a lead rope on the cow. so we went back to the new pen, with the
calf following nuzzling and prodding at the cow every time she stopped to snatch a
mouthful of grass, and the sow trotting on ahead. she (the sow) was the one who moved
slow. she seemed to be moving slower than the cow even while the cow was stopped

k of the rope and hollering at the cow, so it was dark sure
enough when we reached the new pen. but there was still plenty of gap left to drive the
stock through. but then, we never had worried about that.

we drove them in--the two mules, the cow and calf, the sow; we put up the last
panel by feel, and went back to the house. it was full dark now, even in the pasture; we
could see the lamp in the kitchen and the shadow of someone moving across the
window. when ringo and i came in, louvinia was just closing one of the big trunks from the
attic, which hadn't been down stairs since the christmas four years ago which we spent at
hawkhurst, when there wasn't any war and uncle dennison was still alive. it was a big trunk
and heavy even when empty; it had not been in the kitchen when we left to build the pen
so it had been fetched down some time during the afternoon, while joby and loosh were
in the bottom and nobody there to carry it down but granny and louvinia

later, after we came back to the house on the mule, so that was a part of the need
and urgency too; maybe it was father who carried the trunk down from the attic too. and
when i went in to supper, the table was set with the kitchen knives and forks in place of the
silver ones, and the sideboard (on which the silver service had been sitting when i began
to remember and where it had been sitting ever since except on each tuesday afternoon,

it didn't take us long to eat. father had already eaten once early in the afternoon,
and besides that was what ringo and i were waiting for: for after supper, the hour of laxed
muscles and full entrails, the talking. in the spring when he came home that time, we
waited as we did now, until he was sitting in his old chair with the hickory logs p

the mantel above which the captured musket which he had brought home from virginia
two years ago rested on two pegs, loaded and oiled for service. then we listened. we
heard: the names--forrest and morgan and barksdale and van dorn; the words like gap
and run which we didn't have in mississippi even though we did own barksdale, and van
dorn until somebody's husband killed him, and one day general forrest rode down south

tonight. ringo was waiting for me in the hall; we waited until father was settled in his chair
in the room which he and the negroes called the office--father because his desk was
here in which he kept the seed cotton and corn and in this room he would remove his
muddy boots and sit in his stocking feet while the boots dried on the hearth and where the
dogs could come and go with impunity, to lie on the rug before the fire or even to sleep
there on the cold nights--these whether mother, who died when i was bor

so ringo and i squatted again and waited quietly while granny sewed beside the
lamp on the table and father sat in his old chair in its old place, his muddy boots crossed
and lifted into the old heel-marks beside the cold and empty fireplace, chewing the
tobacco which joby had loaned him. joby was a good deal older than father. he was
too old to have been caught short of tobacco just by a war. he had come to mississippi

could tell from the sounds that louvinia was almost through in the kitchen: so that i
decided father was waiting for louvinia to finish and come in to hear too, so i said, "how

because he said, "you can't. you just have to. now you boys run on to bed." we went up
the stairs. but not all the way; we stopped and sat on the top step, just out of the light from
the hall lamp, watching the door to the office, listening; after a while louvinia crossed the
hall without looking up and entered the office; we could hear father and her:



looking up the stairs, who used to follow us up and stand in the bedroom door and scold
at us until we were in bed--i in the bed itself, ringo on the pallet beside it. but this time she
not only didn't wonder where we were, she didn't even think about where we might not
be.
"i knows what's in that trunk," ringo whispered.

"hit's the silver. what you reckon--"


"shhhh," i said. we could hear father's voice, talking to granny. after a while
louvinia came back and crossed the hall again. we sat on the top step, listening to
father's voice telling granny and louvinia both.

up stairs and stood in the door to the bedroom and she didn't even light the lamp; she
couldn't have told whether or not we had undressed even if she had been paying enough
attention to suspect that we had not. she may have been listening as ringo and i were, to

he must have ridden off in the rain, which was still falling at breakfast and then at
dinnertime too, so that it looked as if we wouldn't have to leave the house at all, until at
last granny put the sewing away and said, "very well. get the cook book, marengo."
ringo got the cook book from the kitchen and he and i lay on our stomachs on the floor
while granny opened the book. "what shall we read about today?" she said.


and that's what he was waiting for, though not in the way ringo and i thought,

he would almost decide to risk it before he would change his mind. because he said that

map, and besides, she could see the cedar copse from the kitchen. it was cool and shady
there, and quiet, and ringo slept most of the time, and i slept some too. i was dreaming--it
was like i was looking at our place and suddenly the house and stable and cabins and

s and all were gone and i was looking at a place flat and empty as the sideboard,
and it was growing darker and darker, and then all of a sudden i wasn't looking at it; i was

granny and joby and louvinia and loosh and philadelphy and ringo and me--and then
ringo made a choked sound and i was looking at the road, and there in the middle of it,
sitting on a bright bay horse and looking at the house through a field glass, was a yankee.
for a long time we just lay there looking at him. i don't know what we had expected to
see, but we knew what he was at once; i remember thinking, "he looks just like a man,"
and then ringo and i were glaring at each other, and then we were crawling backward
down the hill without remembering when we started to crawl, and the

table where her sewing lay. "quick!" i said. "shove it up here!" but ringo didn't move; his
eyes looked like door knobs while i dragged the chair up and climbed onto it and began
to lift down the musket. it weighed about fifteen pounds, though it was not the weight so
much as the length; when it came free, it and the chair and all went down with a

maybe because we were not expecting to hear anything else. we didn't look again
either; we were too busy cocking the musket. we had practiced before, once or twice
when granny was not there and joby would come in to examine it and change the cap
on the nipple. ringo held it up and i took the barrel in both hands, high, and drew myself
up and shut my legs about it and slid down over the hammer until it clicked. that's what

"quick!" i said. "hurry!"
"i'm scared," ringo said.

we carried it that way, like a log, one at each end, running. we ran through the

we were doing, we were too busy to look; the musket was already riding up across ringo's
back as he stooped, his hands on his knees and panting, "shoot the bastud! shoot him!"
and then the sights came level, and as i shut my eyes i saw the man and the bright horse
vanish in smoke. it sounded like thunder and it made as much smoke as a brush fire, and i
heard the horse scream, but i didn't see anything else; it was ringo wailing, "great god,

the house didn't seem to get any nearer; it just hung there in front of us, floating and
increasing slowly in size, like something in a dream, and i could hear ringo moaning
behind me, and farther back still the shouts and the hoofs. but we reached the house at
last; louvinia was just inside the door, with father's old hat on her head rag and her mouth
open, but we didn't stop. we ran on into the room where granny was standing beside the

"we shot the bastud, granny!" ringo said. "we kilt him!"

then louvinia was there, too, with her mouth still open, too, and her face like
somebody had thrown ashes at her. only it didn't need her face; we heard the hoofs

the guns. then we heard the boots and spurs on the porch.

ringo and i all seemed to be talking far away. then she said, "quick! here!" and then ringo
and i were squatting with our knees under our chins, on either side of her against her legs,
with the hard points of the chair rockers jammed into our backs and her skirts spread over
us like a tent, and the heavy feet coming in and--louvinia told us afterward--the yankee
sergeant shaking the musket at granny and saying "come on, grandma! where are they!
we saw them run in here!"

we could just hear the sound; it was louvinia that told us how he shook the musket and
banged the butt on the floor.

"what's this?" he said. "what's going on here, harrison?"
"this is where they run to," the sergeant said. "i'm searching the house."
"ah," the colonel said. he didn't sound mad at all. he just sounded cold and short

joby and loosh were in the kitchen. joby was sitting behind the stove with a plate

his knees, but i didn't see him at first because of ringo's shadow. the lamp was on the

we put on our sunday clothes by lamplight, we ate breakfast by it and listened to louvinia
above stairs as she removed from granny's and my beds the linen we had slept under last
night and rolled up ringo's pallet and carried them downstairs; in the first beginning of day
we went out to where loosh and joby had already put the mules into the wagon and
where joby stood in what he called his sunday clothes too--the old frock coat, the napless
beaver hat of father's. wh

musket from the pegs over the mantel. she held out the musket to joby. "here," she said.

granny said. joby was still putting the musket into the wagon; he stopped, his head

t looking back. "remember, joby is getting
old." we put the trunk into the wagon, along with the musket and the basket of food and
the bedclothing, and got in ourselves--granny on the seat beside joby, the bonnet on the
exact top of her head and the parasol raised even before the dew had begun to fall--and
we drove away. loosh had already disappeared, but louvinia still stood at the end of the
gallery with father's old hat on top of her head rag. then i stopped looking back, though i
could feel ringo beside me on the trunk turning every few yards, even after we were
outside the gate and in the road to town. then we came to the curve where we had seen
the yankee sergeant on the bright horse last summer.

"hit gone now," ringo said. "goodbye, sartoris; memphis, how-dy-do!"

the sun was just rising when we came in sight of jefferson; we passed a company
of troops bivouacked in a pasture beside the road, eating breakfast. their uniforms were
not gray anymore now; they were almost the color of d

wagon on to the store and we were just coming out with the sack of salt when uncle buck

the captain of the company we had passed eating breakfast in the pasture. there were
two of them; i mean, there were two mccaslins, amodeus and theophilus, twins, only

granny would not come inside to sleep. she made her bed down in the wagon by the
chest and joby slept under the wagon with the gun beside him like when we camped on
the road. only it would not be exactly on the road but back in the woods a way; on the
third night granny was in the wagon and joby and ringo and i were under the wagon

another house with an old white horse looking at us out of the stable door behind it, and

after the mules, and then we heard the pistols away off like striking a handful of matches
at one time, and joby still sitting on the seat with his mouth still open and the ends of the
cut reins in his hands, and granny still standing in the wagon with the bent umbrella lifted
and hollering at ringo and me while we jumped out of the wagon and ran across the
road.

"the stable," i said. "the stable!" while we were running up the hill toward the house,
we could see our mules still galloping in the field, and we could see the three men running
too. when we ran around the house, we could see the wagon, too, in the road, with joby

the old white horse was watching them, too, in the barn door; he never saw us until he
snorted and jerked back and kicked over something behind him. it was a homemade
shoeing box, and he was tied by a rope halter to the ladder to the loft, and there was
even a pipe still burning on the ground.
we climbed onto the ladder and got on him, and when we came out of the barn

we could still see the three men; but we had to stop while ringo got down and opened
the lot gate and got back on again, and so they were gone, too, by then. when we
reached the woods, there was no sign of them and we couldn't hear anything, either, but
the old horse's insides. we went on slower then, because the old horse wouldn't go fast
again, anyway, and so we tried to listen, and so it was almost sunset when we came out
into a road.

old horse went even slower than ever because presently i caught ringo and held him as
he slipped off and then a little later ringo caught and held me from slipping before i even
knew that i had been asleep. we didn't know what time it was, we didn't care; we only
heard after a time the slow hollow repercussion of wood beneath the horse's feet and we

continued to run ringo and i had dived like two rabbits into a brier patch, feeling no thorn,
and lay on our faces in it while men shouted and horses crashed around us, then hard
hands dragged us, clawing and kicking and quite blind, out of the thicket and onto our
feet. then sight returned--a vacuum, an interval, of amazing and dewy-breathed peace
and quiet while ringo and i stood in a circle of mounted and dismounted men and horses.

ground by the overturned shoeing box. we came back to the road and father sat jupiter
in the middle of the litter of harness scraps.
"you damn boys," he said. "you damn boys."


when we went on now, we went slower; there were three men riding on ahead out
of sight. in the afternoon, one of them came galloping back, and father left ringo and me
three others, and he and the rest rode on; it was almost sunset when they came back with

perfectly still until he would feel ringo's weight on the stirrup; then he would whirl
completely around until his off side faced ringo; the first time ringo wound up lying on his

"get on him from that side," father said laughing. ringo looked at the horse and
then at father. "git up from the wrong side?" ringo said. "i knowed yankees wasn't folks,
but i never knowed before they horses ain't horses."

"get on up," father said. "he's blind in his near eye." it got dark while we were still
riding, and after a while i waked up with somebody holding me in the saddle, and we
were stopped in some trees and there was a fire, but ringo and i didn't even stay awake
to eat, and then it was morning again and all of them were gone but father and eleven

time we didn't build a fire; we didn't even unsaddle right away; we lay hidden in the
woods, and then father was waking me with his hand. it was after sunup and we lay there
and listened to a column of yankee infantry pass in the road, and then i slept again. it was

should have seen that he was still boring, but there was a snake fence along the road, and
all of a sudden it began to blur, and then i realised that father and jupiter had not moved
up at all, that it was all three of us flattening out up toward the crest of the hill where the
road dipped like three swallows, and i was thinking, 'we'r

exactly like i have seen a hawk come out of a sage field and rise over a fence.

when they reached the crest of the hill, i could see sky under them and the tops of
the trees beyond the hill like they were flying, sailing out into the air to drop down beyond
the hill like the hawk; only they didn't. it was like father stopped jupiter in mid-air on top of
the hill; i could see him standing in the stirrups and his arm up with his hat in it, and then
ringo and i were on them before we could even begin to think to pull, and jupiter reined
back onto his haunches, and when father hit ringo's horse across the blind eye with the
hat i saw ringo's horse swerve and jump clean over the snake fence, and i heard ringo
hollering as i went on over the crest of the hill, with father just behind me shooting his pistol
and shouting, "surround them, boys! don't let a man escape!"

because a child can believe anything, given time, but to what it can accept, a limit in

at that moment when father's and my horses came over the hill and seemed to cease
galloping and to float, hang suspended rather in a dimension without time in it while
father held my horse reined back with one hand and i heard ringo's half-blind beast
crashing and blundering among the trees to our right and ringo yelling, and looked quietly
down at the scene beneath rather than before us--the dusk, the fire, the creek running
quiet and peaceful beneath a bridge, the muskets all stacked carefully and neatly and
nobody within fifty feet of them; and the men, the faces, the blue yankee coats and pants
and boots, squatting about the fire with cups in their hands and looking toward the crest
of the hill with the same peaceful expression on all their faces like so many dolls. father's

over the hill, reining back, and i reckon that for a minute their faces looked about like the
yankees' faces did, and now and then i would quit thrashing the bushes and i could hear
ringo on his side hollering and moaning and hollering again, "marse john! you, marse
john! you come here quick!" and hollering for me, calling bayard and colonel and marse
john and granny until it did sound like a company at least, and then hollering at his horse
again, and it running back and forth. i reckon he had forgotten again and was trying to
get up on the nigh side again, until at last father said, "all right, boys. you can come on in."

ringo's horse came bursting out with his blind eye looking big as a plate and still trotting in
a circle with his knees up to his chin, and then ringo came out. he looked wilder than the
horse; he was already talking, he was saying, "i'm gonter tell granny on you, making my
horse run--" when he saw the yankees. his mouth was already open, and he kind of
squatted for a second, looking at them. then he hollered, "look out! ketch um! ketch um,

"shoot 'em," ringo said. "this ain't the first time me and bayard ever shot yankees."

"no," father said. "i have a better plan than that. one that joe johnston will thank
us for." he turned to the others behind him. "have you got the muskets and ammunition?"

we sat there in the dark. the yankees were going to bed. one of them went to the

sound like somebody had shut his hand over his mouth. father didn't laugh out loud; he
just sat there shaking.


father said, "everybody get a blanket and let's go to bed."

while, we came to the creek; we passed the hole where ringo and i learned to swim and
we began to pass the fields, too, and we came to where ringo and i hid last summer and
saw the first yankee we ever saw, and then we could see the house, too, and ringo said,
"sartoris, here we is; let them that want memphis take hit and keep hit bofe." because we
were looking at the house, it was like that day when we ran across the pasture and the
house would not seem to get any nearer at all. we never saw the wagon at all; it was

looked at ringo and me, and went on, with us coming behind, and she didn't stop at the
house. the wagon went on into the orchard and stopped by the hole where we had dug
the trunk up, and still granny didn't say a word; it was father that got down and got into
the wagon and took up one end of the trunk and said over his shoulder, "jump up here,
boys."

jupiter was in his stall, eating; he slashed out at us, his feet banged against the wall right

father already lifting him and i thinking, "he can't jump through that little hole." jupiter took
the doors on his chest, only they seemed to burst before he even touched them, and i saw
him and father again like they were flying in the air, with broken planks whirling and
spinning around them when they went out of sight. and then the yankee rode into the
barn and saw us, and threw down with the carbine and shot at us point-blank with one
hand, like it was a pistol,

smoke was boiling up now, and we could hear it or them--something--maybe all of them
making one sound--the yankees and the fire. and then i saw loosh. he was coming up
from his cabin with a bundle on his shoulder tied up in a bandanna and philadelphy
behind him, and his face looked like it had that night last summer when ringo and i looked
into the window and saw him after he came back from seeing the yankees. granny
stopped fighting. she said, "loosh."

he stopped and looked at her; he looked like he was asleep, like he didn't even
see us or was seeing something we couldn't. but philadelphy saw us; she cringed back
behind him, looking at granny. "i tried to stop him, miss rosa," she said. " 'fore god i tried."

hanging and waiting to die away.

nailed by one edge to a rafter and hanging down to make two rooms. joby was waiting
with the wagon when granny came out with mrs. compson's hat on, and got into the
wagon and told ringo to open the parasol and took up the reins. then we all stopped and
watched joby stick something into the wagon beneath the quilts; it was the barrel and the
iron parts of the musket that ringo and i found in the ashes of the house.

keeping me awake by talking of the railroad which he had never seen though i had seen
it that christmas we spent at hawkhurst. that's how ringo and i were. we were almost the
same age, and father always said that ringo was a little smarter than i was, but that didn't
count with us, anymore than the difference in the color of our skins counted. what
counted was, what one of us had done or seen that the other had not, and ever since
that christmas i had been ahead of ringo because i had seen a railroad, a locomotive.

was as if ringo felt it too and that the railroad, the rushing locomotive which he hoped to
see symbolised it--the motion, the impulse to move which had already seethed to a head
among his people, darker than themselves, reasonless, following and seeking a delusion, a
dream, a bright shape which they could not know since there was nothing in their
heritage, nothing in the memory even of the old men to tell the others. 'this is what we will
find'; he nor they could not have known what it was yet it was there--o

a country where nobody seemed to live at all; all that day we didn't even see a house. i
didn't ask and granny didn't say; she just sat there under the parasol with mrs. compson's
hat on and the horses walking and even our own dust moving ahead of us; after a while
even ringo sat up and looked around.


sudden ringo hollered, "look out! here they come again to git these uns!" we saw it, too,
then--a cloud of dust away to the west, moving slow--too slow for men riding--and then the
road we were on ran square into a big broad one running straight on into the east, as the
railroad at hawkhurst did when granny and i were there that christmas before the war; all
of a sudden i remembered it.

the east. "this is the way," she said. we went on. it seemed like we went slower than ever
now, with the dust cloud behind us and the burned houses and gins and thrown-down
fences on either side, and the white women and children--we never saw a nigger at all--
watching us from the nigger cabins where they lived now like we lived at home; we didn't
stop. "poor folks," granny said. "i wish we had enough to share with them."

at sunset we drew off the road and camped; ringo was looking back. "whatever
hit is, we done went off and left hit," he said. "i don't see no dust." we slept in the wagon
this time, all three of us. i don't know what time it was, only that all of a sudden i was
awake. granny was already sitting up in the wagon, i could see her head against the
branches and the stars. all of a sudden all three of us were sitting up in the wagon,
listening. they were coming up the road it sounded like about fifty of them; we could hear

had been like passing through a country where nobody had ever lived; now it was like
passing through one where everybody had died at the same moment. that night we
waked up three times and sat up in the wagon in the dark and heard niggers pass in the
road. the last time it was after dawn and we had already fed the horses. it was a big
crowd of them this time, and they sounded like they were running, like they had to run to
keep ahead of daylight. then they were gone. ringo and i had taken up the harness
again when granny said, "wait. hush." it was just one, we could hear her panting and
sobbing, and then we heard another sound. granny began to get down from the wagon.
"she fell," she said. "you-all hitch up and come on."

when we turned into the road, the woman was kind of crouched beside it, holding
something in her arms, and granny standing beside her. it was a baby, a few months old;
she held it like she thought maybe granny was going to take it away from her.

said. then she didn't answer. she squatted there in the dust, crouched over the baby. "if i

going to wait for you," granny said. "do you want to die here in the road for buzzards to
eat?" but she didn't even look at granny; she just squatted there.

and meat. we went on; we began to mount the hill. when i looked back she was still

not looking at us. "were the others there in that bottom?" granny asked ringo.

this time the road was empty. that was the morning of the sixth day.

late that afternoon we were descending again; we came around a curve in the late level
shadows and our own quiet dust and i saw the graveyard on the knoll and the marble
shaft at uncle dennison's grave; there was a dove somewhere in the cedars. ringo was
asleep again under his hat in the wagon bed but he waked as soon as i spoke, even
though i didn't speak loud and didn't speak to him. "there's hawkhur

st," i said.

"hawkhurst?" he said, sitting up. "where's that railroad?" on his knees now and
looking for something which he would have to find in order to catch up with me and
which he would have to recognise only through hearsay when he saw it: "where is it?
where?"


yankees done moved hit too."

where the house should have been and there was no house there. and i was not surprised;
i remember that; i was just feeling sorry for ringo, since (i was just fourteen then) if the
house was gone, they would have taken the railroad too, since anybody would rather
have a railroad than a house.
we didn't stop; we just looked quietly at the same mound of ashes, the same four

chimneys standing gaunt and blackened in the sun like the chimneys at home. when we
reached the gate cousin denny was running down the drive toward us. he was ten; he
ran up to the wagon with his eyes round and his mouth already open for hollering.



"you'll hav

the sun was going down. because suddenly i saw it shining level across the place

"where's your mother?" granny said.
"in jingus' cabin," cousin denny said; he didn't even look at granny. "they burnt the



house!" he hollered. "come see what they done to the railroad!"

we ran, all three of us. granny hollered something and i turned and put the parasol
back into the wagon and hollered "yessum!" back at her, and ran on and caught up with
cousin denny and ringo in the road, and we ran on over the hill, and then it came in sight.
when granny and i were here before, cousin denny showed me the railroad, but he was
so little then that jingus had to carry him. it was the straightest thing i ever saw, running
straight and empty and quiet through a long empty gash cut through the trees, and the
ground, too; and full of sunlight like water in a river, only straighter than any river, with the
crossties cut off even and smooth and neat, and the light shining on

up every few yards, and we ran into the cut and we could see where they had dug the
ties up and piled them and set them on fire. but cousin denny was still hollering, "come
see what they done to the rails!" he said.

they were back in the trees; it looked like four or five men had taken each rail and
tied it around a tree like you knot a green cornstalk around a wagon stake, and ringo was
hollering, too, now.



like a squirrel?" ringo hollered. then we all heard the horse at once; we just had time to
look when bobolink came up the road out of the trees and went across the railroad and
into the trees again like a bird, with cousin drusilla riding astride like a man and sitting
straight and light as a willow branch in the wind. they said she was the best woman rider in
the country.

even a form of behavior, but instead were a kind of gully, precipice, into which granny

there was a high bright rosy glow quiet beyond the trees and shining on the river, and now
we could see it plain--the tide of niggers dammed back from the entrance to the bridge
by a detachment of cavalry, the river like a sheet of rosy glass beneath the delicate arch

drag the wagon ashore. we sprinkled water on granny until she came to, and they rigged
harness with ropes and hitched up two of their horses. there was a road on top of the bluff,

had the first letter--the order that colonel dick had given us in alabama last year--she kept
it in the can, too, and by now ringo had learned to copy it so that i don't believe that
colonel dick himself could have told the difference. all they had to do was to put in the
right regiment and whatever number of mules ringo had examined and approved, and
sign the right general's name to it. at first ringo had wanted to sign grant's name every
time, and when granny said that would not do anymore, lincoln's. at last granny found
out that ringo objected to having the yankees think that father's folks would have any
dealings with

 anybody under the general-in-chief. but at last he realised that granny was
right, that they would have to be careful about what general's name was on the letter, as
well as what mules they requisitioned. they were using general smith now; he and forrest
were righting every day up and down the road to memphis, and ringo always
remembered to put in rope.

"i'm worried about this time," granny said. "miz plurella harris," ringo said, writing.
"now we done used up 'p' too. 'member that, now. i reckon when we run out of letters,
maybe we can start in on numbers. we will have nine hundred and ninety-nine before we
have to worry, then." he finished the order and signed "general smith" to it; it looked
exactly like the man

who had signed the one colonel dick gave us was named general
smith, except for the number of mules. then granny turned and looked at me. "tell mr.
snopes to be ready at sunup," she said. we went in the wagon, with ab snopes and his
two men following on two of the mules. we went just fast enough so that we would reach
the bivouac at supper-time, because granny and ringo had found out that that was the
best time--that the stock would all be handy, and the men would be too hungry or sleepy
or something to think very quick in case they happened to think, and we would just have
time to get the mules and get out of sight before dark came. then, if they should decide
to chase us, by the time they found us in the dark, there wouldn't be anything but the
wagon with me and granny in it to capture.

other, and ringo and i sat in the wagon and looked at the cook fires about the grove and
smelled the coffee and the meat. it was always the same. granny would disappear into
the tent or the house, and then, in about a minute, somebody would holler inside the tent
or the house, and then the sentry at the door would holler, and then a sergeant, or even
sometimes an officer, only it would be a lieutenant, would hurry into the tent or the house,

the second now; it would be just enough light left to tell that they were mules, and granny
would get into the wagon and ringo would hang his legs over the tail gate, holding the
lead rope, and we would go on, not fast, so that when we came back to where ab
snopes and his men waited in the woods you could not even tell that they were mules.
then ringo would get onto the lead mule and they would turn off into the woods and

"i don't know what you are talking about," granny said. "i have no mules except this

the officer began to laugh; he sat on the horse, laughing. "so that's your real name,
hey? well, well, well. so you have begun to tell the truth at last. come now, tell me where
those mules are, and tell me where the others you have stolen from us are hid."

then ringo hollered. he and ab snopes and the mules had turned off into the
woods on the right side of the road, but when he hollered now he was on the left side.
"heyo the road!" he hollered. "one busted loose! head um off the road!"

thought he meant two others, because there was just a big noise of bushes and trees like a

the little poor farms without slaves. it took three or four times to get them to come in, but at
last they all came--men and women and children and the dozen niggers that had got free
by accident and didn't know what to do about it. i reckon this was the first church with a
slave gallery some of them had ever seen, with ringo and the other twelve sitting up there
in the high shadows where there was room enough for two hundred; and i could
remember back when father would be in the pew with us and the grove outside would be
full of carriages from the other plantations, and doctor worsham in his stole beneath the
altar, and for each white person in the auditorium there would be ten niggers in the
gallery. and i reckon that on that first sunday when granny knelt down in public, it was the
first time they had ever seen a

for me."

herself or not. and brother fortinbride didn't pray either--not aloud anyway. ringo and i
were just past fifteen then, but i could imagine what doctor worsham would have thought
up to say--about all soldiers did not carry arms, and about they also serve, and how one
child saved from hunger and cold is better in heaven's sight than a thousand slain
enemies. but brother fortinbride didn't say it. i reckon he thought of that; he always had
plenty of words when he wanted to. it was like he said to himself, "words are fine in
peacetime, when everybody is comfortable and easy. but n

excused." he just stood there where doctor worsham used to stand and where the bishop
would stand, too, with his ring looking big as a pistol target. then granny rose up; i didn't
have time to help her; she stood up, and then the long sound went through the church, a
sound kind of like a sigh that ringo said was the sound of the cotton bagging and the
floursacking when they breathed again, and granny turned and looked back toward the
gallery; only ringo was already moving.
"bring the book," she said.


it was a big blank account book; it weighed almost fifteen pounds. they opened it
on the reading desk, granny and ringo side by side, while granny drew the tin can out of
her dress and spread the money on the book. but nobody moved until she began to call
out the names. then they came up one at a time, while ringo read the names off the
book, and the date, and the amount they had received before. each time granny would
make them tell what they i

together, and granny stopped putting the rest of the money back into the can and she
and brother fortinbride did what they did each time. "i'm making out fine with the mule,"
he said. "i don't need any money."

feed a bird the longest day you live. you take this money."
"no," brother fortinbride said. "i'm making out fine."


we walked back home, ringo carrying the book. "you done receipted out four
mules you ain't hardly laid eyes on yet," he said. "what you gonter do about that?"

so it was afternoon when ringo closed the book and got the new receipts

"fiddlesticks," granny said. "you'll never grow enough food out of the ground to

it was a bright warm day; we saw the guns and the bits shining a long way down the
road. but this time ringo didn't even move. he just quit drawing and looked up from the
paper and said, "so ab snopes was lying. gre't god, ain't we gonter never get shet of
them?" it was just a lieutenant; by this time ringo and i could tell the different officers' ranks
better than we could tell confederate ranks, because one day we counted up and the
only confederate officers we had ever seen were father and the captain that talked to us
with uncle buck mccaslin that day in jefferson before grant burned it. and this

both at the same time. ringo didn't recognise him because he had not been in the wagon
with us, but i did:--from the way he sat .the horse, or maybe from the way he looked mad
and happy both, like he had been mad for several days, thinking about how much he was
going to enjoy being mad when the right time came. and he recognised me, too; he
looked at me once and said "hah!" with his teeth showing, and pushed his horse up and
looked at ringo's picture. there were maybe a dozen cavalry behind him; we never

even more of them than i had. "look at it."

the lieutenant looked at me and said "hah!" again behind his teeth; every now and
then while he was talking to ringo he would do that. he looked at ringo's picture. then he
looked up the grove to where the chimneys rose out of the pile of rubble and ashes. grass
and weeds had come up out of the ashes now, and unless you knew better, all you saw
was the four chimneys. some of the goldenrod was still in bloom. "oh," the officer said. "i
see. you're drawing it like it used to be."

then he sat back in the saddle. he didn't say "hah!" now either; it was his eyes that said it,
looking at me. they were a kind of thin milk color, like the chine knucklebone in a ham. "all
right," he said. "who lives up there now? what's her name today, hey?"

ringo was watching him now, though i don't think he suspected yet who he was.
"don't nobody," he

 said. "the roof leaks." one of the men made a kind of sound; maybe it
was laughing. the lieutenant started to whirl around, and then he started not to; then he
sat there glaring down at ringo with his mouth beginning to open. "oh," ringo said, "you
mean way back yonder, in the quarters. i thought you was still worrying about them
chimneys."

this time the soldier did laugh, and this time the lieutenant did whirl around, cursing
at the soldier; i would have known him now even if i hadn't before. he cursed at them all
now, sitting there with his face swelling up. "blank-blank-blank!" he shouted. "get to hell on

reckon she had seen him, too, because she already had her sunbonnet on. they looked at
us once, then granny went on, too, walking straight, not fast, down the path toward the
lot, with the lieutenant behind her on the horse. we could see his shoulders and his head,
and now and then his hand and arm, but we couldn't hear what he was saying. "i reckon
this does complete hit," ringo s

sunbonnet on and the shawl drawn tight over her shoulders where she had her arms
folded in it so that she looked littler than anybody i could remember, like during the four
years she hadn't got any older or weaker, but just littler and littler and straighter and
straighter and more and more indomitable; and the lieutenant beside her with one hand
on his hip and waving a whole handful of letters at granny's face with the other.

"look like he got all we ever wrote there," ringo said. the soldiers' horses were all
tied along the fence; they were inside the pen now, and they and joby and ab snopes
had the forty-odd old mules and the nineteen new ones hemmed into the corner. the
mules were still trying to break out, only it didn't look like that. it looked like every one of
them was trying to keep the big burned smear where granny and ringo had blotted the

"you don't know," the lieutenant said. he didn't start to shout now, he just stood
there, breathing slow and hard, looking at granny; he talked now with a kind of furious
patience, as if she were an idiot or an indian: "listen. i know you don't have to tell me, and
you know i can't make you. i ask it only out of pure respect. respect? envy. won't you tell
me?"


you really don't know. you were too busy running the reaper to count the--" we didn't
move. granny wasn't even looking at him; it was ringo and me that watched him fold the
letters that granny and ringo had written and put them carefully into his pocket. he still
talked quiet, like he was tired: "all right, boys. rope them together and haze them out of
there."
"the gate is a quarter of a mile from here," a soldier said.


"throw down some fence," the lieutenant said. they began to throw down the
fence that joby and i had worked two months on. the lieutenant took a pad from his
pocket, and he went to the fence and laid the pad on th

for a thousand dollars to mrs. rosa millard, i would have to make it good. do you see?"

"yes," granny said. "you need not worry." then they were gone. granny and ringo
and joby and i stood there and watched them drive the mules up across the pasture and
out of sight. we had forgot about ab snopes until he said, "well, hit looks like . . . that's all
they are to hit. but you still got that ere hundred-odd that are out on receipt, provided

after a while granny said:


"joby, put those rails back up." i reckon ringo and i were both waiting for her to tell
us to help joby, but she didn't. she just said "come," and turned and went on, not toward
the cabin but across the pasture toward the road. we didn't know where we were going
until we reached the church. she went straight up the aisle to the chancel and stood
there until we came up. "kneel down," she said.

we knelt in the empty church. she was small between us, little; she talked quiet, not
loud, not fast and not slow; her voice sounded quiet and still,

"ab snopes," granny said. "well." then she walked on; we walked on. "ab snopes,"
she said. "i reckon he beat me, after all. but it can't be helped now. and anyway, we did
pretty well, taken by and large."

granny didn't even stop.

fifteen that grumby, or whoever he was, was a coward and that you might frighten a
brave man, but that nobody dared frighten a coward; and granny, sitting there without
moving at all and saying, "but the horses do not belong to them because they are stolen
property," and we said, "then no more will they belong to us," and granny said, "but they

miles and build a fire in the ram and heat again, until we came to the crossroads, where
ab snopes told us to leave the wagon and walk. and then she would not let me and

had rained all day; it had fallen gray and steady and slow and cold on us all day long,
and now it was like twilight had thickened it without being able to make it any grayer or
colder. the crossroad was not a road any more; it was no more than a faint gash turning
off at right angles into the bottom, so that it looked like a cave. we could see the hoof

no more to do with it than it had in her dealings with the yankees; she just turned and
looked at me, and then i began to cry. i would be sixteen years old before another year
was out, yet i sat there in the wagon, crying. i didn't even know when she freed her arm.
and then she was out of the wagon, standing there looking at me in the gray rain and the
gray darkening light.

"it's for all of us," she said. "for john and you and ringo and joby and louvinia. so
we will have something when john comes back home. you never cried when you knew
he was going into a battle, did you? and now i am taking no risk; i am a woman. even
yankees do not harm old women. you and ringo stay here until i call you."

deep mud of that old road pocked with the prints of ingoing hoofs, but of no wheel,
knowing that we had waited too long either to help her or to share in her defeat. because
there was no sound nor sign of life at all; just the huge rotting building with the gray
afternoon dying wetly upon it, and then at the end of the hall a faint crack of light
beneath a door.

watched granny going down into the earth with the quiet rain splashing on the yellow

before it would be smooth and quiet and level with the other earth. now uncle buck was
talking at ringo, and not hollering now. "catch my mule," he said. "i got the pistol in my
britches."

smaller and better hidden; i reckon he had got the idea from ours. we stopped at the wet

side of the pen there was something that looked like a yellow cloud in the twilight, until it
moved. and then we saw that it was a claybank stallion and three mares.

days in which we rode, the three of us, on relays of granny's and ringo's yankee mules
along the known roads and the unknown (and sometimes unmarked) trails and paths, in
the wet and the iron frost, and nights when we slept in the same wet and the same freeze
and (once) in the snow, beneath whatever shelter we found when night found us. they
had neither name nor number. they lasted from that december afternoon until late
february, until one night we realised that we had been hearing geese and ducks going
north for some time. at first ringo kept a pine stick and eac

but one night when the stick had almost forty notches in it, we stopped in the rain to make
camp without any roof to get under and we had to use the stick to start a fire, because of
uncle buck's arm. and so, when we came to where we could get another pine stick, we
couldn't remember whether it had been five or six or ten days, and so ringo didn't start
another. because he said he would fix the stick up the day we got grumby and that it
wouldn't need but two notches on it--one for the day we got him and one for the day

old men and women and children, too--with cotton bagging and flour sacking for uniforms

ringo and me still unconscious in the stable with even his shirt cut to pieces like they had
had a wire snapper on the whip, and a woman with a little thread of blood still running out
of her mouth and her voice sounding light and far away like a locust from across the
pasture, telling us how many there were and which way they would likely go saying, "kill

fferson and we would have never ridden out

ridden late without coming to a house or a shed to camp in, and so we stopped and
ringo said he would scout around a little, because all we had left to eat was the bone of
a ham; only it was more likely ringo was trying to dodge helping to get in the firewood. so
uncle buck and i were spreading down pine branches to sleep on when we heard a shot
and then a sound like a brick chimney falling onto a rotten shingle roof, and then the
horses, starting fast and dying away, and then i could hear ringo yelling. he had come
onto a house; he thought it was deserted, and then he said it looked too dark, too quiet.

so we went on at daylight, following the hoofprints now. then we had three more
notches in the stick; that night ringo put the last notch in it that he was going to, but we
didn't know it. we were sitting in front of a cotton pen where we were going to sleep,

his little feet side by side and his elbows out a little and his two hands on his knees as small
as a woman's hands and covered with a light mat of fine black hair right down to the
finger nails, and not looking at any of us now. i don't know what he was looking at now.

the stranger said.

"two is correct," ringo said. "i reckon ab snopes can pass for a man."

so then it was too late; we just sat there, with the stranger facing us across the fire
with the mare's reins in his little still hand, looking at the three of us from between his hat
and his beard. "ab snopes," he said. "i don't believe i am acquainted with ab snopes. but i
know grumby. and you want grumby too." he was looking at all of us now. "you want to

they looked at each other; they didn't move. "but you are neither a woman nor a
child, old man," the stranger said. he stood up, easy; his eyes glinted in the firelight as he
turned and put the reins over the mare's head. "i reckon i'll get along," he said. we
watched him get into the saddle and sit there again, with his little black-haired hands lying
on the pommel, looking down at us--at me and ringo now. "so you want ab snopes," he
said. "take a stranger's advice and stick to him."

that i saw the spurred mare jump before i saw the pistol flash; and then the mare was

pistol, and then all three of us were dragging and fighting over it, but the front sight was

rheumatism; that was why uncle buck cussed so bad; he said the rheumatism was bad
enough, and the bullet was bad enough, but to have them both at once was too much
for any man. and then, when ringo told him he ought to be thankful, that suppose the
bullet had hit his good arm and then he wouldn't even be able to feed himself, he
reached back and, still lying down, he caught up a stick of firewood and tried to hit ringo
with it. we cut his sleeve away and stopped the blood, and he made me cut a strip off his
shirt tail, and ringo handed him his stick and he sat there cussing us while we soaked the
strip in hot salt water, and he held the arm himself with his good hand, cussing a steady

could get to it quick, saying, "wait. wait," and his eyes hard and snapping with thinking. "it's

getting bad--we all ate supper together, and it was ab snopes that was the most anxious
about uncle buck, saying how it wasn't any hard feelings and that he could see himself
that he had made a mistake in trusting the folks he did, and that all he wanted to do now
was to go back home, because it was only the folks you had known all your life that you

bushes, cursing. he shot three times toward the fading sound of the horses, then he whirled
back to face us. ringo and i were on the ground, too; i don't remember when we got
down nor why, but we were down, and i remember how i looked once at ringo's face
and then how i stood there with uncle buck's pistol feeling heavy as a firedog in my hand.
then i saw that he had quit whirling; that he was standing there with the pistol hanging
against his right leg and that he was looking at me; and then all of a sudden he was
smiling.

and i could hear my voice; it soun

but the smile was gone from it. "in this pistol?" he said. it was like he was examining a pistol
for the first time, so slow and careful it was that he passed it from his right to his left hand
and let it hang again, pointing down again. "well, well, well. sholy i ain't forgot how to
count as well as how to shoot." there was a bird somewhere--a yellowhammer--i had been
hearing it all the time; even the three shots hadn't frightened it. and i could hear ringo,
too, making a kind of whimpering sound when he breathed, and it was like i wasn't trying
to watch grumby so much as to keep from looking at ringo. "well, she's safe enough now,
since it don't look like i can even shoot with my right hand."

was a captive, and so, even now he seemed more like a stump than even an animal,
even though we had watched him leap and catch up the pistol and run firing after the

me like when granny told us about the balloon she saw in st. louis and we would dream
about it.

and the gray coat rushing down, and then the ground hitting me. but i could smell him--
the smell of man sweat, and the gray coat grinding into my face and smelling of horse

socket, and i thought "in a minute i will hear my fingers breaking, but i have got to hold
onto it" and then--i don't know whether it was under or over his arm or his leg--i saw ringo,
in the air, looking exactly like a frog, even to the eyes, with his mouth open too and his
open pocket knife in his hand.

his hands and knees and i tried to raise the pistol only my arm wouldn't move. then
grumby bucked ringo off just like a steer would and whirled again, looking at us,
crouched, with his mouth open too; and then my arm began to come up with the pistol
and he turned and ran. he shouldn't have tried to run from us in boots. or maybe that
made no difference either, because now my arm had come up and now i could see
grumby's back (he didn't scream, he never made a sound) and the pistol both at the
same time and the pistol was level and steady as a rock.

it took us the rest of that day and part of

the night to reach the old compress. but it didn't
take very long to ride home because we went fast with the two mounts apiece to change
to, and what we had to carry now, wrapped in a piece of the skirt of grumby's coat, didn't
weigh anything.

rode past the brick piles and the sooty walls that hadn't fallen down yet, and went on
through what used to be the square. we hitched the mules in the cedars and ringo was
just starting off to find a board when we saw that somebody had already put one up--mrs.
compson, i reckon, or maybe uncle buck when he got back home. we already had the
piece of wire.

granny had not wanted to be dead either but now she had begun to be reconciled. we
unwrapped it from the jagged square of stained faded gray cloth and fastened it to the
board. "now she can lay good and quiet," ringo said.

we had ridden a lot, and during the last week we hadn't slept much and we hadn't

"what?" i said. "father? father's home? father?"
"and miss drusilla!" louvinia hollered, crying and praying and pawing at me, and

so it was good and dark when we came to the cabin. and then we saw that it was

lighted like for christmas;

hollering and scolding at ringo all at once. "home! hit done finished! all but the
surrendering. and now marse john done home." she finally told us how father and drusilla
had come home about a week ago and uncle buck told father where ringo and i were,
and how father had tried to make drusilla wait at home, but she refused, and how they
were looking for us, with uncle buck to show the way.

one motion, with louvinia's face hanging over us and still scolding, and joby in the
chimney corner where louvinia had made him get up out of granny's chair. and then
somebody was pulling at me, and i thought i was fighting ab snopes again, and then it

was the rain in father's beard and clothes that i smelled. but uncle buck was still hollering,
and father holding me, and ringo and i held to him, and then it was drusilla kneeling and
holding me and ringo, and we could smell the rain in her hair, too, while she was hollering
at uncle buck to hush. father's hand was hard; i could see his face beyond drusilla and i
was trying to say, "father, father," while she was holding me and ringo with the rain smell
of her hair all around us, and uncle buck hollering and joby looking at uncle buck with his
mouth open and his eyes round.

"yes, by godfrey! not only tracked him down and caught him but brought back
the actual proof of it to where rosa millard could rest quiet." "the which?" joby hollered.
"fotch back the which?" "hush! hush!" drusilla said. "that's all done, all finished. you, uncle
buck!"

and drusilla rode up to that old compress, the first thing we see was that murderin

was just before christmas in 1864, after the yankees had burned jefferson and gone away,
and we didn't even know for sure if the war was still going on or not. all we knew was that
for three years the country had been full of yankees, and then all of a sudden they were
gone and there were no men there at all anymore. we hadn't even heard from father
since july, from carolina, so that now we lived in a world of burned towns and houses and
ruined plantations and fields inhabited only by women. ringo and i were fifteen then; we
felt almost exactly like we had to eat and sleep and change our clothes in a hotel built
only for ladies and children.

the envelope was worn and dirty and it had been opened once and then glued
back, but we could still make out hawkhurst, gihon county, alabama on it even though
we did not recognise aunt louisa's hand at first. it was addressed to granny; it was six
pages cut with scissors from wallpaper and written on both sides with pokeberry juice and i
thought of

drusilla was either.

not only taken along with them all living men blue and gray and white and black, but
even one young girl who had happened to try to look and act like a man after her
sweetheart was killed.

so then the next letter came. only granny wasn't there to read it because she was
dead then (it was the time when grumby doubled back past jefferson and so ringo and i
spent one night at home and found the letter when mrs. compson had sent it out) and so
for a while ringo and i couldn't make out what aunt louisa was trying to tell us. this one
was on the same wallpaper too, six pages this time, only aunt louisa hadn't cried in the
pokeberry juice this time: ringo said because she must have been writing too fast:

dear sister:

rved for drusilla the highest destiny of a southern woman--to be the bride--
widow of a lost cause--and how drusilla had not only thrown that away, she had not only
become a lost woman and a shame to her father's memory but she was now living in a
word that aunt louisa would not even repeat but that granny knew what it was, though
at least thank god that father and drusilla were not actually any blood kin, it being
father's wife who was drusilla's cousin by blood and not father himself. so then ringo lit the
other pine-knot and then we put the sheets of wallpaper down on the floor and then we
found out what it was: how drusilla had been gone for six months and no word from her
except she was alive, and then one night she walked into the cabin where aunt louisa
and denny were (and now it had a line drawn under it, like this:) in the garments not alone
of a man but of a common private soldier and told them how she had been a member of
father's troop for six months, bivouacking at night surrou

e and father must marry at once, drusilla said, "can't you understand that i am tired
of burying husbands in this war? that i am riding in cousin john's troop not to find a man
but to hurt yankees?" and how aunt louisa said:

the third letter did not come to us at all. it came to mrs. compson. drusilla and father were
home then. it was in the spring and the war was over now, and we were busy getting the
cypress and oak out of the bottom to build the house and drusilla working with joby and
ringo and father and me like another man, with her hair shorter than it had been at
hawkhurst and her face sunburned from riding in the weather and her body thin from living
like soldiers lived. after granny died ringo and louvinia and i all slept in the cabin, but
after father came ringo and louvinia moved back to the other cabin with joby and now
father and i slept on ringo's and my pallet and drusilla slept in the bed behind the quilt
curtain where granny used to sleep. and so one night i remember

and i showed it to drusilla and father, and father found out that drusilla had not written to
tell aunt louisa where she was and father said she must, and so one day mrs. compson
came out with the third letter. drusilla and ringo and louvinia too were down in the
bottom at the sawmill and i saw that one too, on the wallpaper with the pokeberry juice
and the juice not cried on this time either, and this the first time mrs. compson had come
out since granny died and not even getting out of her surrey but sitting there holding to

s yet still furious with movement. "is that what you think too?" she said. then she
was gone. every now and then i could see her footprints, spaced and fast, just inside the
woods, but when i came out of the bottom, i couldn't see her. but the surreys and buggies
were still in front of the cabin and i could see mrs. compson and the other ladies on the
porch, looking out across the pasture toward the bottom, so i did not go there. but before i
came to the other cabin, where louvinia and joby and ringo lived, i saw louvinia come
up the hill from the spring, carrying her cedar water bucket and singing. then she went into
the cabin and the singing stopped short off and so i knew where drusilla was. but i didn't
hide. i went to the window and looked in and saw drusilla just turning from where she had
been leaning her head in her arms on the mantel when louvinia came in with the water
bucket and a gum twig in her mouth and father's old hat on top of her head rag. drusilla
was crying. "that's what

had joined forces with the men who had been our enemies against a new foe whose
means we could not always fathom but whose aim we could always dread. so he was
busy in town all day long. they were building jefferson back, the courthouse and the
stores, but it was more than that which father and the other men were doing; it was
something which he would not let drusilla or me or ringo go into town to see. then one
day ringo slipped off and went to town and came back and he looked at me with his
eyes rolling a little.

of this stuff in one hand and a clutch of nigger voting tickets in the yuther." so we were
busy; we just saw father at night and sometimes then ringo and i and even drusilla would
take one look at him and we wouldn't ask him any questions. so it didn't take them long,
because drusilla was already beaten; she was just marking time without knowing it from
that afternoon when the fourteen ladies got into the surreys and buggies and went back
to town until one afternoon about two months later when we heard denny hollering even
before the wagon came in the gates, and aunt louisa sitting on one of the trunks (that's
what beat drusilla: the trunks.

said. "it don't matter. come. get up, soldier."

whipped; like in the dress she could neither fight back nor run away. and so she didn't
come down to the log-yard any more, and now that father and i slept in the cabin with
joby and ringo, i didn't even see drusilla except at mealtime. and we were busy getting
the timber out, and now everybody was talking about the election and how father had
told the two burdens before all the men in town that the election would never be held with
cash benbow or any other nigger in it and how the burdens had dared him to stop it. and
besides, the other cabin would be full of jefferson ladies all day; you would have thought
that drusilla was mrs. habersham's daughter and not aunt louisa's. they

in her hair as i had smelled the rain in it and in father's beard that night four years ago
when he and drusilla and uncle buck mccaslin found grumby and then came home and
found ringo and me more than just asleep: escaped into that oblivion which god or
nature or whoever it was had supplied us with for the time being, who had had to perform
more than should be required of children because there should be some limit to the age,
the youth at least below which one should not have to kill. this was just after the saturday
night when he returned and i watched him clean the derringer and reload it and we
learned that the dead man was almost a neighbor, a hill man who had been in t

we reached home just before midnight; we didn't have to pass through jefferson either.
before we turned in the gates i could see the lights, the chandeliers--hall, parlor, and what
aunt jenny (without any effort or perhaps even design on her part) had taught even ringo
to call the drawing room, the light falling outward across the portico, past the columns.
then i saw the horses, the faint shine of leather and buckle-glints on the black silhouettes
and then the men too--wyatt and others of father's old troop--and i had forgot that they
would be there. i had forgot that they would be there; i remember how i thought, since i
was tired and spent with strain, now it will have to begin tonight. i won't even have until
tomorrow in which to begin to resist. they had

"yes," drusilla said in that silvery ecstatic voice. "oh yes. there will be plenty of time

didn't look at him yet because i knew that when i did i would begin to pant; i went to aunt
jenny who had just risen from a chair behind which louvinia stood. she was father's sister,
taller than drusilla but no older, whose husband had been killed at the very beginning of
the war, by a shell from a federal frigate at fort moultrie, come to us from carolina six
years ago. ringo and i went to tennessee junction in the wagon to meet her. it was
january, cold and clear and with ice in the ruts; we returned just before dark with aunt
jenny on the seat beside me holding a lace parasol and ringo in the wagon bed nursing
a hamper basket containing two bottles of old sherry and the two jasmine cuttings which
were bushes in the garden now, and the panes of colored glass which she had salvaged
from the carolina house where she and father and uncle bayard were born and which

first to see what i was going to do. so the house was quiet when i went down to the
diningroom, no sound in it except simon snoring in the parlor, probably still sitting on the
stool though i didn't look in to see. instead i stood at the diningroom window and drank
the coffee which louvinia brought me, then i went to the stable; i saw joby watching me
from the kitchen door as i crossed the yard and in the stable loosh looked up at me across
betsy's head, a curry comb in his hand, though ringo didn't look at me at all. we curried
jupiter then. i didn't know if we would be able to without trouble or not, since always
father would come in first and touch him and tell him to stand and he would stand like a
marble horse (or pale bronze rather) while loosh curried him. but he stood for me too, a

but it was there, waiting, a part of the alteration, as though by being dead and no longer
needing air he had taken all of it, all that he had compassed and claimed and postulated
between the walls which he had built, along with him. aunt jenny must have been
waiting; she came out of the diningroom at once, without a sound, dressed, the hair that
was like father's combed and smooth above the eyes that were different from father's
eyes because they were not intol

carriage horses, he rode up beside

outline of it inside his shirt, probably the one we had taken from grumby that day we killed

sun, all the suspended fierce heat in which the equinox could not seem to occur and were

the smell of powder smoke still lingered a little, still lay somewhere on the hot dead air
though invisible now, blinking a little with his fierce pale unintroverted eyes. "well by god,"
he said again. "maybe you're right, maybe there has been enough killing in your family
without--come on." we left the office. i waited at the foot of the stairs and soon ringo
came up with the horses. we crossed the square again. there were no feet on the holston
house railing now (it was twelve o'clock) but a group of men stood before the door who
raised their hats and i raised mine and ringo and i rode on.

sat the mare, trying to open the gate without dismounting, until ringo dismounted and
opened it. we crossed the pasture in the hard fierce sun; i could have seen the house

yankee mules. presently i heard the water, then i could see the sunny glints. we
dismounted. i lay on my back, i thought: now it can begin again if it wants to. but it did
not. i went to sleep. i went to sleep almost before i had stopped thinking. i slept for almost
five hours and i didn't dream anything at all yet i waked myself up crying, crying too hard
to stop it. ringo was squatting beside me and the sun was gone though there was a bird
of some sort still singing somewhere and the whistle of the north-bound evening train
sounded and the short broken puffs of starting where it had evidently stopped at our flag

"don't you want to wait and ride out with me?"
"no. i'll go on."

magnolia, the night song now, the drowsy moony one, and again the moon like the rim
print of a heel in wet sand. there was just one light in the hall now and so it was all over
though i could still smell the flowers even above the verbena in my coat. i had not looked
at him again. i had started to before i left
