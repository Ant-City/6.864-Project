the [CHARACTER] - 
                    in
the pardoner's tale, the three rioters encounter a very [CHARACTER]
whose body is completely covered except for his face. before the
[CHARACTER] tells the rioters where they can find "death," one of the
rioters rashly demands why the [CHARACTER] is still alive. the [CHARACTER] answers
that he is doomed to walk the earth for eternity. he has been interpreted
as death itself, or as cain, punished for fratricide by walking
the earth forever; or as the wandering jew, a man who refused to let
christ rest at his house when christ proceeded to his crucifixion,
and who was therefore doomed to roam the world, through the ages,
never finding rest.
