act i

the spectators will find the curtain raised and the stage as it usually is during the day time. it will be half dark, and empty, so that from the beginning the public may have the impression of an impromptu performance. prompter's box and a small table and chair for the manager.

two other small tables and several chairs scattered about as during rehearsals.

the actors and actresses of the company enter from the back of the stage: first one, then another, then two together; nine or ten in all. they are about to rehearse a pirandello play: mixing it up. [il giuoco delle parti.] some of the company move off towards their dressing rooms. the prompter who has the "book" under his arm, is waiting for the manager in order t

the actors and actresses, some standing, some sitting, chat and smoke. one perhaps reads a paper; another cons his part.

finally, the manager enters and goes to the table prepared for him. his secretary brings him his mail, through which he glances. the prompter takes his seat, turns on a light, and opens the "book."



the manager [throwing a letter down on the table]. i can't see [to property man.] let's have a little light, please!

property man. yes sir, yes, at once. [a light comes down on to the stage.]

the manager [clapping his hands]. come along! come along! second act of "mixing it up." [sits down.] [the actors and actresses go from the front of the stage to the wings, all except the three who are to begin the rehearsal.]

the manager [to property man]. fix up the old red room.

property man [noting it down]. red set. all right!

the prompter [continuing to read from the "book"]. "table already laid and writing desk with books and papers. book-shelves. exit rear to leo's bedroom. exit left to kitchen. principal exit to right."

the manager [energetically]. well, you understand: the principal exit over there; here, the kitchen. [turning to actor who is to play the part of socrates.] you make your entrances and exits here. [to property man.] the baize doors at the rear, and curtains.

property man [noting it down]. right!

 reason, your wife is instinct. it's a mixing up of the parts, according to which you who act your own part become the puppet of yourself. do you understand?

leading man. i'm hanged if i do.

the manager. neither do i. but let's get on with it. it's sure to be a glorious failure anyway. [confidentially.] but i say, please face three-quarters. otherwise, what with the abstruseness of the dialogue, and the public that won't be able to hear you, the whole thing will go to hell. come on! come on!

prompter. pardon sir, may i get into my box? there's a bit of a draught.

the manager. yes, yes, of course!

at this point, the door-keeper has entered from the stage door and advances towards the manager's table, taking off his braided cap. during this manoeuvre, the six characters enter, and stop by the door at back of stage, so that when the door-keeper is about to announce their coming to the manager, they are already on the stage. a tenuous light surrounds them, almost as if irradiated by them -- t

the father [resisting]. no, no, look here, we . . .

the manager [roaring]. we come here to work, you know.

leading actor. one cannot let oneself be made such a fool of.

the father [determined, coming forward]. i marvel at your incredulity, gentlemen. are you not accustomed to see the characters created by an author spring to life in yourselves and face each other? just because there is no "book" [pointing to the prompter's box.] which contains us, you refuse to believe . . .

the step-daughter [advances towards manager, smiling and coquettish]. believe me, we are really six most interesting characters, sir; side-tracked however.

the father. yes, that is the word! [to manager all at once.] in the sense, that is, that the author who created us alive no longer wished, or was no longer able, materially to put us into a work of art. and this was a real crime, sir; because he who has had the luck to be born a charac

al what no son ought ever to reveal: how father and mother live and are man and wife for themselves quite apart from that idea of father and mother which we give them? when this idea is revealed, our life is then linked at one point only to that man and that woman; and as such it should shame them, shouldn't it?

[the mother hides her face in her hands. from the dressing-rooms and the little door at the back of the stage the actors and stage manager return, followed by the property man, and the prompter. at the same moment, the manager comes out of his office, accompanied by the father and the step-daughter.]

the manager. come on, come on, ladies and gentlemen! heh! you there, machinist!

machinist. yes sir?

the manager. fix up the white parlor with the floral decorations. two wings and a drop with a door will do. hurry up!

[the machinist runs off at once to prepare the scene, and arranges it while the manager talks with the stage manager, the property man, and the prompter on matters of de

property man. that's all right, miss. we've got any amount of them.

the manager [to the step-daughter]. we want some clothes pegs too, don't we?

the step-daughter. yes, several, several!

the manager. see how many we've got and bring them all.

property man. all right!

[the property man hurries off to obey his orders. while he is putting the things in their places, the manager talks to the prompter and then with the characters and the actors.]

the manager [to prompter]. take your seat. look here: this is the outline of the scenes, act by act. [hands him some sheets of paper.] and now i'm going to ask you to do something out of the ordinary.

prompter. take it down in shorthand?

the manager [pleasantly surprised]. exactly! can you do shorthand?

prompter. yes, a little.

the manager. good! [turning to a stage hand.] go and get some paper from my office, plenty, as much as you can find. [

the stage hand goes off, and soon returns with a handful of paper which he gives to the prompter.]

the manager [to prompter]. you follow the scenes as we play them, and try and get the points down, at any rate the most important ones. [then addressing the actors.] clear the stage, ladies and gentlemen! come over here [pointing to the left.] and listen attentively.

leading lady. but, excuse me, we . . .

the manager [guessing her thought]. don't worry! you won't have to improvise.

the manager. nothing. for the moment you just watch and listen. everybody will get his part writt

t we can. they're going to act now.

the father [as if fallen from the clouds into the confusion of the stage]. we? what do you mean, if you please, by a rehearsal?

the manager. a rehearsal for them. [points to the actors.]

the father. but since we are the characters . . .

the manager. all right: "characters" then, if you insist on calling yourselves such. but here, my dear sir, the characters don't act. here the actors do the acting. the characters are there, in the "book" [pointing towards prompter's box.] -- when there is a "book"!

the father. i won't contradict you; but excuse me, the actors aren't the characters. they want to be, they pretend to be, don't they? now if these gentlemen here are fortunate enough to have us alive before them . . .

the manager. oh this is grand! you want to come before the public yourselves then?

the father. as we are . . .

the manager. i can assure you it would be a magnificent spectacle!

leading man. what's the use of us here anyway then?

the manager. excuse me, but are you the manager, or am i? [to the father, who looks undecided and perplexed.] get on with it, man! go down there to the back of the stage. you needn't go off. then come right forward here.

[the father does as he is told, looking troubled and perplexed at first. but as soon as he begins to move, the reality of the action affects him, and he begins to smile and to be more natural. the actors watch intently.]

the manager [sotto voce, quickly to the prompter in his box]. ready! ready? get ready to write now.

the father [coming forward and speaking in a different tone]. good afternoon, miss!

the step-daughter [head bowed down slightly, with restrained disgust]. good afternoon!

the father [looks under her hat which partly covers her face. perceiving she is very young, he makes an exclamation, partly of surprise, partly of fear lest he compromise himself in a risky adventure]. ah . . . but . . . ah . . . i say . . . this is not the first time that

the father. . . . in mourning! of course: i beg your pardon: i'm frightfully sorry . . .

the step-daughter [forcing herself to conquer her indignation and nausea]. stop! stop! it's i who must thank you. there's no need for you to feel mortified or specially sorry. don't think any more of what i've said. [tries to smile.] i must forget that i am dressed so . . .

the manager [interrupting and turning to the prompter]. stop a minute! stop! don't write that down. cut out that last bit. [then to the father and step-daughter.] fine! it's going fine! [to the father only.] and now you can go on as we arranged. [to the actors.] pretty good that scene, where he offers her the hat, eh?

the step-daughter. the best's coming now. why can't we go on?

the manager. have a little patience! [to the actors.] of course, it must be treated rather lightly.

leading man. still, with a bit of go in it!

leading lady. of course
