v'd knows nought that knows not this:
    men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is.
    that she was never yet that ever knew
    love got so sweet as when desire did sue;
    therefore this maxim out of love i teach:
    achievement is command; ungain'd, beseech.
    then though my heart's content firm love doth bear,
    nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.

    what grief hath set these jaundies o'er your cheeks?
    the ample proposition that hope makes
    in all designs begun on earth below
    fails in the promis'd largeness; checks and disasters
    grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,
    as knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,
    infects the sound pine, and diverts his grain
    tortive and errant from his course of growth.

  achilles. come, patroclus, i'll speak with nobody. come in with me,
    thersites.
exit
  thersites. here is such patchery, such juggling, and such knavery.
    all the argument is a whore and a cuckold-a good quarrel to draw
    emulous factions and bleed to death upon. now the dry serpigo on
    the subject, and war and lechery confound all!

  patroclus. within his tent; but ill-dispos'd, my lord.
  agamemnon. let it be known to him that we are here.
    he shent our messengers; and we lay by
    our appertainings, visiting of him.
    let him be told so; lest, perchance, he think
    we dare not move the question of our place
    or know not what we are.
  patroclus. i shall say so to him.

  ulysses. we saw him at the opening of his tent.

    no, this thrice-worthy and right valiant lord
    shall not so stale his palm, nobly acquir'd,
    nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,
    as amply titled as achilles is,
    by going to achilles.
    that were to enlard his fat-already pride,
    and add more coals to cancer when he burns
    with entertaining great hyperion.

    he merits well to have her that doth seek her,
    not making any scruple of her soilure,
    with such a hell of pain and world of charge;

    not palating the taste of her dishonour,
    with such a costly loss of wealth and friends.
