 when he is 
angry, though he is kind enough if humoured. still i warn you he gets angry easily." 
the dwarves all gathered round when they heard the wizard talking like this to bilbo. "is 
that the person you are taking us to now?" they asked. 
"couldn't you find someone more easy-tempered? hadn't you better explain it all a bit 
clearer?"-and so on. 

"yes it certainly is! no i could not! and i was explaining very carefully," answered the 
wizard crossly. "if you must know more, his name is 
beorn. he is very strong, and he is a skin-changer." 
"what! a furrier, a man that calls rabbits conies, when he doesn't turn their skins into 
squirrels?" asked bilbo. 
"good gracious heavens, no, no, no, no!" said gandalf. "don't be a fool mr. baggins if 
you can help it; and in the name of all wonder don't mention the word furrier again as 
long as you are within a hundred miles of his house, nor, rug, cape, tippet, muff, nor any 
other such unfortunate word! he is a skin-changer. he changes his s

 with his bushy eyebrows. 
"that is mr. baggins, a hobbit of good family and unimpeachable reputation," said 
gandalf. bilbo bowed. he had no hat to take off, and was painfully conscious of his 
many missing buttons. "i am a wizard," continued gandalf. "i have heard of you, if you 
have not heard of me; but perhaps you have heard of my good cousin radagast who 
lives near the southern borders of mirkwood?" 
"yes; not a bad fellow as wizards go, i believe. i used to see him now and again," said 
beorn. "well, now i know who you are, or who you say you are. 
what do you want?" 
"to tell you the truth, we have lost our luggage and nearly lost our way, and are rather in 
need of help, or at least advice. i may say we have had rather a bad time with goblins in 
the mountains." 
"goblins?" said the big man less gruffly. "o ho, so you've been having trouble with them 
have you? what did you go near them for?" 
"we did not mean to. they surprised us at night in a pass which we had to cross, we

 with the light of the westering sun which 
slanted into it, and fell golden on the garden full of flowers that came right up to 
the steps. 

here they sat on wooden benches while gandalf began his tale, and bilbo swung his 
dangling legs and looked at the flowers in the garden, wondering what their names could 
be, as he had never seen half of them before. 
"i was coming over the mountains with a friend or two..." said the wizard. 
"or two? i can only see one, and a little one at that," said beorn. 
"well to tell you the truth, i did not like to bother you with a lot of us, until i found out if 
you were busy. i will give a call, if i may." 
"go on, call away!" 
so gandalf gave a long shrill whistle, and presently thorin and dori came round the 
house by the garden path and stood bowing low before them. 
"one or three you meant, i see!" said beorn. "but these aren't hobbits, they are 
dwarves!" 
"thorin oakenshield, at your service! dori at your service!" said the two 
dwarves bowing aga

in. 
"i don't need your service, thank you," said beorn, "but i expect you need mine. i am not 
over fond of dwarves; but if it is true you are thorin (son of thrain, son of thror, i 
believe), and that your companion is respectable, and that you are enemies of goblins 
and are not up to any mischief in my lands-what are you up to, by the way?" 
"they are on their way to visit the land of their fathers, away east beyond mirkwood," put 
in gandalf, "and it is entirely an accident that we are in your lands at all. we were 
crossing by the high pass th

at should have brought us to the road that lies to the south 
of your country, when we were attacked by the evil goblins-as i was about to tell you." 
"go on telling, then!" said beorn, who was never very polite. 
"there was a terrible storm; the stone-giants were out hurling rocks, and at the head of 
the pass we took refuge in a cave, the hob bit and i and several of our companions..." 
"do you call two several?" 
"well, no. as a matter of fact there were more than two." 
"where are they? killed, eaten, gone home?" 
"well, no. they don't seem all to have come when i whistled. shy, i expect. you see, we 
are very much afraid that we are rather a lot for you to entertain." 
"

go on, whistle again! i am in for a party, it seems, and one or two more won't make 
much difference," growled beorn. 
gandalf whistled again; but nori and ori were there almost before he had stopped, for, if 
you remember, gandalf had told them to come in pairs every five minutes. 
"hullo!" said beorn. "you came pretty quick-where were you hiding? come on my jack-
in-the-boxes!" 
"nori at your service, ori at . . ." they began; but beorn interrupted them. 
"thank you! when i want your help i will ask for it. sit down, and let's get on with this 
tale, or it will be supper-time before it is ended." 
"as soon as we were asleep," went on gandalf, "a crack at the back of the cave opened; 
goblins came out and grabbed the hobbit and the dwarves and our troop of ponies-" 
"troop of ponies? what were you-a travelling circus? or were you carrying lots of 
goods? or do you always call six a troop?" 
"o no! as a matter of fact there were

 bending and 
bowing and waving their hoods before their knees (in proper dwarf-fashion), till he 
stopped frowning and burst into a chuckling laugh; they looked so comical. 

"troop, was right," he said. "a fine comic one. come in my merry men, and what are 
your names? i don't want your service just now, only your names; and then sit down and 
stop wagging!" 
"balin and dwalin," they said not daring to be offended, and sat flop on the floor looking 
rather surprised. 
"now go on again!" said beorn to the wizard. 
"where was 1? o yes- i was not grabbed. i killed a goblin or two with a flash-" 
"good!" growled beorn. "it is some good being a wizard, then." 
"-and slipped inside the crack before it closed. i followed down into the main hall, which 
was crowded with goblins. the great goblin was there with thirty or forty armed guards. 
i thought to myself 'even if they were not all chained together, what can a dozen do 
against so many?' " 
"a dozen! that's the first time i've heard eight c

alled a dozen. or have you still got some 
more jacks that haven't yet come out of their boxes?" 
"well, yes, there seem to be a couple more here now - fili and kili, i believe," said 
gandalf, as these two now appeared and stood smiling and bowing. 
"that's enough!" said beorn. "sit down and be quiet! now go on, gandalf!" 
so gandalf went on with the tale, until he came to the fight in the dark, the discovery of 
the lower gate, and their horror when they found that mr. baggins had been mislaid. 
"we counted ourselves and found that there was no hobbit. there were only fourteen of 
us left!" 
"fourteen! that's the first time i've heard one from ten leave fourteen. 
you mean nine, or else you haven't told me yet all the names of your party." 
"well, of course you have

n't seen oin and gloin yet. and, bless me! here they are. i 
hope you will forgive them for bothering you." 
"o let 'em all come! hurry up! come along, you two, and sit down! but look here, 
gandalf, even now we have only got yourself and ten dwarves and the hobbit that was 
lost. that only makes eleven (plus one mislaid) and not fourteen, unless wizards count 
differently to other people. but now please get on with the tale." beorn did not show it 
more than he could help, but really he had begun to get very interested. you see, in the 
old days he had known the very part of the mountains that gandalf was describing. he 
nodded and he growled, when he heard of the hobbit's reappearance and of their 
scramble down the stone-slide and of the wolf-ring m the woods. when gandalf came to 
their climbing into trees with the wolves all underneath, he got up and strode about 
and muttered: 
"i wish i had been there! i would have

given them more than fireworks!" 
"well," said gandalf very glad to see that his tale was making a good impression, "i did 
the best i could. there we were with the wolves going mad underneath us and the forest 
beginning to blaze in places, when the goblins came down from the hills and discovered 
us. they yelled with delight and sang songs making fun of us. fifteen birds in five fir-
trees..." 
"good heavens!" growled beorn. "don't pretend that goblins can't count. 
they can. twelve isn't fifteen and they know it." 
"and so do 1. there were bifur and bofur as well. i haven't ventured to introduce them 
before, but here they are." 
in came bifur and bofur. "and me!" gasped bombur pulling up behind. he was fat, and 
also angry at being left till last. he refused to wait five minutes, and followed immediately 
after the other two. 
"well, now there are fifteen of you; and since goblins can count, i suppose that is al

there were up the trees. now perhaps we can finish this story without any more 
interruptions." mr. baggins saw then how clever gandalf had been. the interruptions 

had really made beorn more interested in the story, and the story had kept him from 
sending the dwarves off at once like suspicious beggars. he never invited people into his 
house, if he could help it. he had very few friends and they lived a good way away; and 
he never invited more than a couple of these to his house at a time. now he had got 
fifteen strangers sitting in his porch! 
by the time the wizard had finished his tale and had told of the eagles' rescue and of 
how they had all been brought to the carro

ck, the sun had fallen behind the peaks of the 
misty mountains and the shadows were long in beorn's garden. 
"a very good tale!" said he. "the best i have heard for a long while. if all beggars could 
tell such a good one, they might find me kinder. you may be making it all up, of course, 
but you deserve a supper for the story all the same. let's have something to eat!" 
"yes, please!" they all said together. "thank you very much!" 
inside the hall it was now quite dark. beorn clapped his hands, and in trotted four 
beautiful white ponies and several large long-bodied grey dogs. 
beorn said something to them in a queer language like animal noises turned into talk. 
they went out again and soon came back carrying torches in their mouths, which they lit 
at the fire and stuck in low brackets on the pillars of the hall about the central hearth. 
the dogs could stand on their hind-legs when they wished, and carry things with their 
fore-feet. quickly they got out boards

now-white sheep led by a large coal-
black ram. one bore a white cloth embroidered at the edges with figures of animals; 
others bore on their broad backs trays with bowls and platters and knives and wooden 
spoons, which the dogs took and quickly laid on the trestle tables. these were very low, 
low enough even for bilbo to sit at comfortably. beside them a pony pushed two low-
seated benches with wide rushbottoms and little short thick legs for gandalf and thorin, 
while at the far end he put beorn's big black chair of the same sort (in which he sat with 
his great legs stuck far out under the table). these were all the chairs he had in his hall, 
and he probably had them low like the tables for the convenience of the wonderful 
animals that waited on him. what did the rest sit on? they were not forgotten. the other 
ponies came in rolling round drum-shaped sections of logs, smoothed and polished, and 
low enough even for bilbo; so soon they were all seated at beorn's table, and the hall

had not seen such a gathering for many a year. 
there they had a supper, or a dinner, such as they had not had since they left the last 
homely house in the west and said good-bye to elrond. the light of the torches and the 
fire flickered about them, and on the table were two tall red beeswax candles. all the 
time they ate, beorn in his deep rolling voice told tales of the wild lands on this side of 
the mountains, and especially of the dark and dangerous wood, that lay outstretched far 
to north and south a day's ride before them, barring their way to the east, the terrible 
forest of mirkwood. 
the dwarves listened and shook their beards, for they knew that they must soon venture 
into that forest and that after the mountains it was the worst of the perils they had to 
pass before they came to the dragon's stronghold.
 
 ___________________________
 
 when dinner was over they began to 
tell tales of their own, but beorn seemed to be growing drowsy and paid little heed to 
them. they spoke most of gold and silver and jewels and the making of things by smith-
craft, and beorn did not appear to care for such things: there were no things of gold or 
silver in his hall, and few save the knives were made of metal at all. 
they sat long at the table with their wooden drinking-bowls filled with mead. the dark 
night came on outside. the fires in the middle of the hall were built with fresh logs and 
the torches were put out, and still they sat in the light of the dancing flames with the 
pillars of the house standing tall behind them, arid dark at the top like trees of th

e forest. 

whether it was magic or not, it seemed to bilbo that he heard a sound like wind in the 
branches stirring in the rafters, and the hoot of owls. soon he began to nod with sleep 
and the voices seemed to grow far away, until he woke with a start. 
the great door had creaked and slammed. beorn was gone. the dwarves were sitting 
cross-legged on the floor round the fire, and presently they began to sing. some of the 
verses were like this, but there were many more, and their singing went on for a long 
while: 
 
"the wind was on the withered heath, 
but in the forest stirred no leaf: 
there shadows lay by night and day, 
and dark things silent crept beneath. 
the wind came down from mountains cold, 
and like a tide it roared and rolled; 
the branches groaned, the forest moaned, 
and l

where racing clouds were torn and rent. 
it passed the lonely mountain bare 
and swept above the dragon's lair : 
there black and dark lay boulders stark 
and flying smoke was in the air. 
it left the world and took its flight 
over the wide seas of the night. 
the moon set sail upon the gale, 
and stars were fanned to leaping light." 
 
bilbo began to nod again. suddenly up stood gandalf. "it is time for us to sleep," be 
said, "-for us, but not i think for beorn. in this hall we can rest sound and safe, but i warn 
you all not to forget what beorn said before he left us: you must not stray outside until 
the sun is up, on your peril." 
bilbo found that beds had already been laid at the side of the hall, on a sort of raised 
platform between the pillars and the outer wall. for him there was a little mattress of 
straw and woollen blankets. he snuggled into them very gladly, summertime though it 
was. the fire burned low and he fell asleep. 
yet in the n

ight he woke: the fire had now sunk to a few embers; the dwarves and 
gandalf were all asleep, to judge by their breathing; a splash of white on the floor came 
from the high moon, which was peering down through the smokehole in the roof. 
there was a growling sound outside, and a noise as of some great animal scuffling at 
the door. bilbo .wondered what it was, and whether it could be beorn in enchanted 
shape, and if he would come in as a bear and kill them. 
he dived under the blankets and hid his head, and fell asleep again at last in spite of his 
fears. 

it was full morning when he awoke. one of the dwarves had fallen over him in the 
shadows where he lay, and had rolled down with a bump from the platform on to the 
floor. it was bofur, and he was grumbling about it, when bilbo opened his eyes. 
"get up lazybones," he said, "or there will be no breakfast left for you."

jumped bilbo. "breakfast!" he cried. "where is breakfast?" 
"mostly inside us," answered the other dwarves who were moving around the hall; "but 
what is left is out on the veranda. we have been about looking for beorn ever since the 
sun got up; but there is no sign of him anywhere, though we found breakfast laid as soon 
as we went out." 
"where is gandalf?" asked bilbo, moving off to find something to eat as quick as he 
could. 
"o! out and about somewhere," they told him. but he saw no sign of the wizard all that 
day until the evening. just before sunset he walked into the hall, where the hobbit and 
the dwarves were having supper, waited on by beorn's wonderful animals, as they had 
been all day. of beo

ing them at last chasing one another out of the hole in the 
roof. 
they must have looked very queer from outside, popping out into the air one after 
another, green, blue, red, silver-grey, yellow, white; big ones, little ones; little ones 
dodging through big ones and joining into figureeights, and going off like a flock of birds 
into the distance. 
"i have been picking out bear-tracks," he said at last. "there must have been a regular 
bears' meeting outside here last night. i soon saw that beorn could not have made them 
all: there were far too many of them, and they were of various sizes too. i should say 
there were little bears, large bears, ordinary bears, and gigantic big bears, all dancing 
outside from dark to nearly dawn. they came from almost every direction, except from 
the west over the river, from the mountains. in that direction only one set of footprints 
led-none coming, only ones going away from here. 
i followed these as far as the carrock. there they disappeared into

bilbo thought he knew what the wizard meant. "what shall we do," he cried, "if he leads 
all the wargs and the goblins down here? we shall all be caught and killed! i thought 
you said he was not 9 friend of theirs." 

"so i did. and don't be silly! you had better go to bed, your wits are sleepy." 
the hobbit felt quite crushed, and as there seemed nothing else to do he did go to bed; 
and while the dwarves were still singing songs he dropped asleep, still puzzling his little 
head about beorn, till he dreamed a dream of hundreds of black bears dancing slow 
heavy dances round and round in the moonlight in the courtyard. then he woke up when 
everyone else was asleep, and he heard the same scraping, scuffling, snuffling, and 
growling as before. next morning they were all wakened by beorn himself. 
"so here you all are still!" he said. he picked up the hobbit and laughed: "not eaten up 
by wargs or goblins or wicked bears yet i see"; and he poked mr. baggins' waistcoat

ctfully. "little bunny is getting nice and fat again on bread and honey," he 
chuckled. "come and have some more!" 
so they all went to breakfast with him. beorn was most jolly for a change; indeed he 
seemed to be in a splendidly good humour and set them all laughing with his funny 
stories; nor did they have to wonder long where he had been or why he was so nice to 
them, for he told them himself. he had been over the river and right back up into the 
mountains-from which you can guess that he could travel quickly, in bear's shape at any 
rate. from the burnt wolfglade he had soon found out that part of their story was true; 
but he had found more tha

the chief wolf's nose and the death from the 
wizard's fire of many of his chief servants. so much they told him when he forced them, 
but he guessed there was more wickedness than this afoot, and that a great raid of the 
whole goblin army with their wolfallies into the lands shadowed by the mountains might 
soon be made to find the dwarves, or to take vengeance on the men and creatures that 
lived there, and who they thought must be sheltering them. 
"it was a good story, that of yours," said beorn, "but i like it still better now i am sure it is 
true. you must forgive my not taking your word. if you lived near the edge of mirkwood, 
you would take the word of no one that you did not know as well as your brother or 
better. as it is, i can only say that i have hurried home as fast as i could to see that you 
were safe, and to offer you any help that i can. i shall think more kindly of dwarves after 
this. killed the great goblin, killed the great goblin!" he chuckled fiercely to himself.

"what did you do with the goblin and the warg?" asked bilbo suddenly. 
"come and see!" said beorn, and they followed round the house. a goblin's head was 
stuck outside the gate and a warg-skin was nailed to a tree just beyond. beorn was a 
fierce enemy. but now he was their friend, and gandalf thought it wise to tell him their 
whole story and the reason of their journey, so that they could get the most help he 
could offer. 
this is what he promised to do for them. he would provide ponies for each of them, and 
a horse for gandalf, for their journey to the forest, and he would lade them with food to 
last them for weeks with care, and packed so as to be as easy as possible to carry-nuts, 
flour, sealed jars of dried fruit

ever you come back this way again." 
they thanked him, of course, with many bows and sweepings of their hoods and with 
many an "at your service, o master of the wide wooden halls!" but their spirits sank at 
his grave words, and they all felt that the adventure was far more dangerous than they 
had thought, while all the time, even if they passed all the perils of the road, the dragon 
was waiting at the end. 
all that morning they were busy with preparations. soon after midday they ate with 
beorn for the last time, and after the meal they mounted the steeds he was lending 
them, and bidding him many farewells they rode off through his gate at a good pace. 
as soon as they left his high hedges at the east of his fenced lands they turned north 
and then bore to the north-west. by his advice they were no longer making for the main 
forest-road to the south of his land. had they followed the pass, their path would have 
led them down the stream from the mountains that joined the great river

 miles south of 
the carrock. at that point there was a deep ford which they might have passed, if they 
had still had their ponies, and beyond that a track led to the skirts of the wood and to the 
entrance of the old forest road. but beorn had warned them that that way was now often 
used by the goblins, while the forest-road itself, he bad heard, was overgrown and 
disused at the eastern end and led to impassable marshes where the paths had long 
been lost. its eastern opening had also always been far to the south of the lonely 
mountain, and would have left them still with a long and difficult northward march when 
they got to the other side. 
north of the carrock the edge of mirkwood drew closer to the borders of the great riv

er, 
and though here the mountains too drew down nearer, beorn advised them to take this 
way; for at a place a few days' ride due north of the carrock was the gate of a little-
known pathway through mirkwood that led almost straight towards the lonely mountain. 
"the goblins," beorn had said, "will not dare to cross the great river for a hundred miles 
north of the carrock nor to come near my house - it is well protected at night!- but i 
should ride fast; for if they make their raid soon they will cross the river to the south and 
scour all the edge of the forest so as to cut you off, and wargs run swifter than ponies. 
still you are safer going north, even though you seem to be going back nearer to their 
strongholds; for that is what they will least expect, and they wil

catch you. be off now as quick as you may!" 
that is why they were now riding in silence, galloping wherever the ground was grassy 
and smooth, with the mountains dark on their left, and in the distance the line of the river 
with its trees drawing ever closer. the sun had only just turned west when they started, 
and till evening it lay golden on the land about them. it was difficult to think of pursuing 
goblins behind, and when they had put many miles between them and beorn's house 
they began to talk and to sing again and to forget the dark forest-path that lay in front. 
but in the evening when the dusk came on and the peaks of the mountains glowered 
against the sunset they made a camp and set a guard, and most of them slept uneasily 
with dreams in which there came the howl of hunting wolves and the cries of goblins. 
still the next morning dawned bright and fair again. 

there was an autumn-like mist white upon the ground and the air was chill, but soon the

the east and the mists vanished, and while the shadows were still long 
they were off again. so they rode now for two more days, and all the while they saw 
nothing save grass and flowers and birds and scattered trees, and occasionally small 
herds of red deer browsing or sitting at noon in the shade. sometimes bilbo saw the 
horns of the harts sticking up out of the long grass, and at first he thought they were the 
dead branches of trees. that third evening they were so eager to press on, for beorn 
had said that they should reach the forest-gate early on the fourth day, that they rode still 
forward after dusk and into the night beneath the moon. as the light faded bilbo thought 
he saw away to the right, or to the left, the shadowy form of a great bear prowling along 
in the same direction. but if he dared to mention it to gandalf, the wizard only said: 
"hush! take no notice!" 
next day they started before dawn, though their night had been short. as soon as it was 
light they could see

e resting almost beneath the great overhanging 
boughs of its outer trees. their trunks were huge and gnarled, their branches twisted, 
their leaves were dark and long. ivy grew on them and trailed along the ground. 
"well, here is mirkwood!" said gandalf. "the greatest of the forests of the northern 
world. i hope you like the look of it. now you must send back these excellent ponies you 
have borrowed." 
the dwarves were inclined to grumble at this, but the wizard told them they were fools. 
"beorn is not as far off as you seem to think, and you had better keep your promises 
anyway, for he is a bad enemy. mr. baggins' eyes are sharper than yours, if you have 
not seen each night after dark a great bear going along with us or sitting far of in the 
moon watching our camps. not only to guard you and guide you, but to keep an eye on 
the ponies too. beorn may be your friend, but he loves his animals as his children. you 
do not guess what kindness he has shown you in letting dwarves ride th

they were thirsty too, for they had none too much water, and in all the time they had 
seen neither spring nor stream. this was their state when one day they found their path 
blocked by a running water. it flowed fast and strong but not very wide right across the 
way, and it was black, or looked it in the gloom. it was well that beorn had warned them 
against it, or they would have drunk from it, whatever its colour, and filled some of their 
emptied skins at its bank. as it was they only thought of how to cross it without wetting 
themselves in its water. there had been a bridge of wood across, but it had rotted and 
fallen leaving only the broken posts near the bank.

bank! now why couldn't it have been this side!"

cry out three of the dwarves had leaped to their feet and loosed off arrows from their 
bows. none seemed to find their mark. the deer turned and vanished in the trees as 
silently as they had come, and in vain the dwarves shot their arrows after them. 
"stop! stop!" shouted thorin; but it was too late, the excited dwarves had wasted their 
last arrows, and now the bows that beorn had given them were useless. 
they were a gloomy party that night, and the gloom gathered still deeper on them in the 
following days. they had crossed the enchanted stream; but beyond it the path seemed 

to straggle on just as before, and in the forest they could see no change. yet if they had 
known more about it and considered the meaning of the hunt and the white deer that 
had appeared upon their path, they would have known that they were at last drawing 
towards the eastern edge, and wo

, and they hurried 
along then, not caring if it was trolls or goblins. the light was in front of them and to the 
left of the path, and when at last they had drawn level with it, it seemed plain that torches 
and fires were burning under the trees, but a good way off their track. 
"it looks as if my dreams were coming true," gasped bombur puffing up behind. he 
wanted to rush straight off into the wood after the lights. but the others remembered only 
too well the warnings of the wizard and of beorn. "a feast would be no good, if we never 
got back alive from it," said thorin. 
"but without a feast we shan't remain alive much longer anyway," said bombur, and 
bilbo heartily agreed with him. they argued about it backwards and forwards for a long 
while, until they agreed at length to send out a couple of spies, to creep near the lights 
and find out more about them. but then they could not agree on who was to be sent: no 
one seemed anxious to run the chance of being lost and never finding

 you a name," he said to it, "and i shall call you sting." 
after that he set out to explore. the forest was grim and silent, but obviously he had first 
of all to look for his friends, who were not likely to be very far off, unless they had been 
made prisoners by the elves (or worse things). 
bilbo felt that it was unsafe to shout, and he stood a long while wondering in what 
direction the path lay, and in what direction he should go first to look for the dwarves. "o! 
why did we not remember beorn's advice, and gandalf's!" he lamented. "what a mess 
we are in now! we! i only wish it was we: it is horrible being all alone." 
in the end he made as good a guess as he could at the direction from which the cries for 
help had come in the night - and by luck (he was born with a good share of it) be 
guessed more or less right, as you will see. having made up his mind he crept along as 
cleverly as he could. hobbits are clever at quietness, especially in woods, as 1. have 
already told you; als

great floods and rains had swollen the waters that flowed east; and there had been an 
earthquake or two (which some were inclined to attribute to the dragon-alluding to him 
chiefly with a curse and an ominous nod in the direction of the mountain). the marshes 
and bogs had spread wider and wider on either side. paths had vanished, and many a 
rider and wanderer too, if they had tried to find the lost ways across. the elf-road 
through the wood which the dwarves had followed on the advice of beorn now came to a 
doubtful and little used end at the eastern edge of the forest; only the river offered any 
longer a safe way from the skirts of mirkwood in the north to the mountain-shadowed 
plains beyond, and the river was guarded by the wood-elves' king. 
so you see bilbo had come in the end by the only road that was any good. 
it might have been some comfort to mr. baggins shivering on the barrels, if he had 
known that news of this had reached gandalf far away and given him great anxiety,

all the same mr. baggins kept his head more clear of the bewitchment of the hoard than 
the dwarves did. long before the dwarves were tired of examining the treasures he 
became wary of it and sat down on the floor; and he began to wonder nervously what 
the end of it all would be "i would give a good many of these precious goblets, thought, 
"for a drink of something cheering out of one beorn's wooden bowls!" 
"thorin!" he cried aloud. "what next? we are armed, but what good has any armour ever 
been before against smaug the dreadful? this treasure is not yet won back. we are not 
looking for gold yet, but for a way of escape; and we have tempted luck too long!" 
'"you speak the truth!" answered thorin, recovering his wits. "let us go! 
i will guide you. not in a thousand years should i forget the ways of this palace." then he 
hailed the others, and they gathered together, and hold

commotion among all things with wings that dwelt on the borders of the desolation of the 
dragon. the air was filled with circling flocks, and their swift-flying messengers flew here 
and there across the sky. 
above the borders of the forest there was whistling, crying and piping. far over 
mirkwood tidings spread: "smaug is dead!" leaves rustled and startled ears were lifted. 
even before the elvenking rode forth the news had passed west right to the pinewoods 
of the misty mountains; beorn had heard it in his wooden house, and the goblins were at 
council in their caves. 
"that will be the last we shall hear of thorin oakenshield, i fear," said the king. "he 
would have done better to have remained my guest. it is an ill wind, all the same," he 
added, "that blows no one any good." for he too had not forgotten the legend of the 
wealth of thror. so it was that bard's messengers found him now marching with many 
spearmen and bowmen; and crows were gathered thick, above him, for th

length smelling battle from afar they had come speeding down the gale in the nick of 
time. they it was who dislodged the goblins from the mountainslopes, casting them over 
precipices, or driving them down shrieking and bewildered among their foes. it was not 
long before they had freed the lonely mountain, and elves and men on either side of the 
valley could come at last to the help of the battle below. 
but even with the eagles they were still outnumbered. 
in that last hour beorn himself had appeared - no one knew how or from where. he 
came alone, and in bear's shape; and he seemed to have grown almost to giant-size in 
his wrath. the roar of his voice was like drums and guns; and he tossed wolves and 
goblins from his path like straws and feathers. he fell upon their rear, and broke like a 
clap of thunder through the ring. the dwarves were making a stand still about their lords 
upon a low rounded hill. 
then beorn stooped and lifted thorin, who had fallen pierced wi

then he turned away. 
the elf-host was on the march;. and if it was sadly lessened, yet many were glad, for 
now the northern world would be merrier for many a long day. 
the dragon was dead, and the goblins overthrown, and their hearts looked forward after 
winter to a spring of joy. gandalf and bilbo rode behind the elvenking, and beside them 
strode beorn, once again in man's shape, and he laughed and sang in a loud voice upon 
the road. so they went on until they drew near to the borders of mirkwood, to the north of 
the place where the forest river ran out. 
then they halted, for the wizard and bilbo would not enter the wood, even though the 
king bade them stay a while in his halls. they intended to go along the edge of the 
forest, and round its northern end in the waste that lay between it and the beginning of 
the grey mountains. it was a

long and cheerless road, but now that the goblins were 
crushed, it seemed safer to them than the dreadful pathways under the trees. moreover 
beorn was going that way too. 
"farewell! o elvenking!" said gandalf. "merry be the greenwood, while the world is yet 
young! and merry be all your folk!" 
"farewell! o gandalf!" said the king. "may you ever appear where you are most needed 
and least expected! the oftener you appear in my halls the better shall i be pleased!"

he brought out a necklace of silver and pearls that dain had given him at their p

will take your gift, o bilbo the magnificent!" said the king gravely. 
"and i name you elf-friend and blessed. may your shadow never grow less (or stealing 
would be too easy)! farewell!" 
then the elves turned towards the forest, and bilbo started on his long road home. 
he had many hardships and adventures before he got back. the wild was still the wild, 
and there were many other things in it in those days besides goblins; but he was well 
guided and well guarded-the wizard was with him, and beorn for much of the way-and 
he was never in great danger again. anyway by mid-winter gandalf and bilbo had come 
all the way back, along both edges of the forest, to the doors of beorn's house; and 
there for a while they both stayed. yule-tide was warm and merry there; and men came 
from far and wide to feast at beorn's bidding. the goblins of the misty mountains were 
now few and terrified, and hidden in the deepest holes they could find; and the wargs 
had vanished from the woods, so that men w

ent abroad without fear. beorn indeed 
became a great chief afterwards in those regions and ruled a wide land between the 
mountains and the wood; and it is said that for many generations the men of his line had 
the power of taking bear's shape, and some were grim men and bad, but most were in 
heart like beorn, if less in size and strength. in their day the last goblins were hunted 
from the misty mountains and a new peace came over the edge of the wild. it was 
spring, and a fair one with mild weathers and a bright sun, before bilbo and gandalf took 
their leave at last of beorn, and though he longed for home. bilbo left with regret, for the 
flowers of the gardens of beorn were m springtime no less marvellous than in high 
summer. at last they came up the long road, and reached the very pass where

then the elves of the valley came out and greeted them and led them across the water 
to the house of elrond. there a warm welcome was made them, and there were many 
eager ears that evening to hear the tale of their adventures. gandalf it was who spoke, 
for bilbo was fallen quiet and drowsy. 
most of the tale he knew, for he had been in it, and had himself told much of it to the 
wizard on their homeward way or in the house of beorn; but every now and again he 
would open one eye, and listen, when a part of the story which he did not yet know came 
in. it was in this way that he learned where gandalf had been to; for he overheard the 
words of the wizard to elrond. it appeared that gandalf had been to a great council of 
the white wizards, masters of lore and good magic; and that they had at last driven the 
necromancer from his dark hold in the south of mirkwood. 
"ere long now," gandalf was saying, "the forest will grow
