mrs.[CHARACTER] - 
                a
servant who acts as the governess's companion and confidante. mrs.
grose, who is illiterate, is very aware of her low standing in comparison
with the governess and treats the governess with great respect.
mrs.[CHARACTER] listens patiently to the governess's constantly changing
theories and insights, most often claiming to believe her but sometimes
questioning whether the ghosts may not be imaginary. the governess,
however, tends to overwhelm mrs.[CHARACTER], often finishing mrs.[CHARACTER]'s
sentences or leaping to conclusions about what mrs.[CHARACTER] is saying.
thus, it can sometimes be difficult for us to judge whether mrs.
grose is as strongly on the governess's side as the governess thinks.
mrs.[CHARACTER] cares deeply about flora and miles and consistently defends
them against the governess's accusations.
