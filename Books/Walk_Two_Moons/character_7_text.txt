ough i did have a way with maps, it was not really
because of that skill that i was going, nor was it to see the 'whole ding-dong
country' that gram and gramps were going. the real reasons were buried
beneath piles and piles of unsaid things.

   some of the real reasons were:

   1. gram and gramps wanted to see momma who was resting peacefully in
lewiston. idaho.

   2. gram and gramps knew that i wanted to see momma, but that i was
afraid to.

   3. dad wanted to be alone with the red-headed margaret cadaver. he had
already seen momma and he had not taken me. also - although this wasn't
as important - i think dad did not trust gram and gramps to behave
themselves along the way unless they had me with them. dad said that if
they tried to go on their own, he would save everyone a lot of time and
embarrassment by calling the police and having them arrested before they
even left the driveway. it might sound a bit extreme for a man to call the
police on his own tottery old parents but when my grandparen

ll over herself being nice to me. 'what lovely hair,' she said, and

'aren't you sweet!' i was not sweet that day. i was being particularly ornery.
i wouldn't sit down and i wouldn't look at margaret.

   as we were leaving, i overheard margaret whisper to my father, 'john,
have you told her yet - how we met?'

   my father looked exceedingly uncomfortable. 'no, he said. 'i tried - but she
doesn't want to know.'

   now that was the truth, absolutely. who cares? i thought. who cares how
he met margaret cadaver?

   i was standing on the porch, and i saw phoebe's face again at the window
next door. at the time, all i could think of was getting to our new house,
which i hoped would be miles and miles away, out in the green countryside.
when at last we left mrs. cadaver and mrs. partridge, we drove for
approximately three minutes. two blocks from margaret cadaver's was the
place where my father and i were now going to live.

   if someone had blindfolded me and spun me around a few times and
driven me a

peeling apples.

   phoebe and i walked home from school together. we stopped briefly at my
house so that i could call my father at work. margaret had helped him find a
job selling farm machinery. when i phoned him that day, he said it made
him happy as a clam at high water to know i had a new friend. maybe this is
really why he was happy, i thought, or maybe it was because he could be
alone with margaret cadaver.

   phoebe and i then walked to her house. as we passed margaret cadaver's
house, a voice called out 'sal? sal? is that you'!'

   phoebe put her hand up to her mouth and said. 'oh!'

   in the shadows on the porch. margaret's mother. mrs. partridge, sat in a
wicker rocker. a thick, gnarled cane with a handle carved in the shape of a
cobra's head lay across her knees her purple dress had slipped up over her
bony knees, which were spread apart, and, i hate to say it, you could see
right up her

rkable,' i said.

   phoebe said, 'it's not that remarkable, sal. i wouldn't exactly use the word
"remarkable".

   'but, phoebe,' i said, 'mrs. partridge is blind.'

   both phoebe and her mother said, 'blind?'

   later, phoebe said to me, 'don't you think it's odd' that mrs. partridge,
who is blind, could see something about me - but i, who can see, was blind
about her? and speaking of odd, there's something very odd about that mrs.
cadaver.


   'margaret?' i said.

   'is that her name?   margaret cadaver?   mrs. margaret cadaver?'

   'yes'

   'she scares me half to death,' phoebe said.

   'why?'

   'that's what i'm telling you,' she said. 'first, there is that name: cadaver.
you know what cadaver means?'

   actually, i did not.

   'it means dead body.'

   'are you sure?' i said.

   'of course i am sure, sal. you can check the dictionary if you want. do
you know what she does for a living - what her job is?'

   'yes.` i was pleased to say. i was pleased to know something. 'she's a
nurse

.

   'exactly.' phoebe said. 'would you want a nurse whose name meant dead
body? and that hair. don't you think all that sticking-out red hair is spooky?
and that voice. it reminds me of dead leaves all blowing around on the
ground.'

   this was phoebe's power. in her world, no one was ordinary. people were
either perfect - like her father - or, more often, they were weird lunatics or
axe murderers she could convince me of just about any- thing - especially
about margaret cadaver. from that day on, margaret cadaver's hair did look
spooky and her voice did sound exactly like dead leaves. somehow it was
easier to deal with margaret if there were reasons not to like her, and i
definitely did not want to like her.


   'do you want to know an absolute secret?' phoebe said. (i did.) 'promise
not to tell.' (i promised.) 'maybe i shouldn't,' she said. 'your father goes over
there all the time. your father likes her, doesn't he?'

   'yes probably. maybe.'

   'i won't say, th

planations'

   later, when i was doing my homework, i found myself doodling in the
margin of my english book. i had drawn a figure of a woman with wild hair
and evil eyes and a rope around her neck. i drew a tree, fastened the rope to
it, and hung her.

   the next day at school, i studied mr. birkway as he leaped and cavorted
about the classroom. if he was a murderer, he certainly was a lively one. i
had always pictured murderers as being mopey and sullen. i hoped mr.
birkway was in love with margaret cadaver and would marry her and take
her away so that my father and i could go back to bybanks

   what i found most surprising about mr. birkway was that he increasingly
reminded me of my mother - or. at least, of my mother before the sadness set
in. there was a liveliness to both mr. birkway and my mother. and an
excitement - a passion - for words and for stories

   that day, mr. birkway talked about creek mythology and how exciting
and thrilling it was going to be to have the opportunity to study a

   'you don't care,' phoebe said. 'nobody cares. everyone has his own idiot
agenda.'

   i left shortly after dinner. mr. winterbottom was in his study, phoning his
wife's friends to see if they had any idea of where she might have gone.

   'at least,' phoebe said to me, 'he's taking some action, but i still think
someone should call the police.'

   as i left phoebe's the dead leaf crackly voice of margaret cadaver called
to me from her house next door. 'sal? sal?' i stopped, but i did not go up the
walk. 'do you want to come in?' she said.

   'i have to go home.'

   'but, your father's here - we're having dessert. won't you join us?'

   my father appeared behind her. 'come on, sal,' he said. 'don't be a goose.'
'i am not a goose,' i said. 'i already had dessert, and i'm going home to work
on my english report.'

   my father turned to margaret. 'i'd better go with her. sorry--'

   margaret didn't say

 anything. she just stood there as my father retrieved
his jacket and joined me. dad and i walked home together. i knew it was
mean, but i felt as if i had won a little victory over margaret cadaver. on
the way home, dad asked if phoebe's mother had come back yet.

   'no.' i said. 'phoebe thinks a lunatic has carried her off.'

   'a lunatic? isn't that a bit far-fetched?'


   'that's what i thought at first, but you never know, do you? i mean it could
happen. 'there could actually be a lunatic who--'

   'sal.'

   i was going to explain about the nervous young man and the mysterious
messages, but my father would call me a goose. instead, i said, 'how do you
know that someone - not exa

ot figure out what on earth was the matter with her. it was a
terrible day. we had tests in maths and science. in french, our teacher
lectured us for the entire class period about how sloppy our work was. at
lunch, phoebe ignored me. then came english.

   mr. birkway skipped into the room. people were gnawing on their fingers
and tapping their feet and wriggling around and generally getting ulcers,
wondering if mr. birkway was going to read from the journals. i just kept
staring at him. he and margaret cadaver were twins? was that possible?
the most disappointing part of that piece of knowledge was that he was not
going to fall in love with mrs. cadaver and marry her and take her away.

   mr. birkway opened a cupboard, pulled out the journals, slipped the
yellow paper over the cover of one and read:

   this is what i like about jane. [there was no jane, of course. he was
substituting a name.] she is smart, but doesn't act like she knows everything.
she is cute. she smells good. she is cute. she mak

to the street. she said,
'come on, try it.' i spit into the street. 'what do you think?' phoebe said. we
spit again.

   it might sound thumpingly disgusting, but to tell the truth, we got a great
deal of pleasure from those spits. i doubt if i ever could explain why that
was, but for some reason it seemed the perfect thing to do, and when phoebe
turned around and went into the house, i knew that that was the right thing
for her to do, too.

   with the courage of that spit in me, i went to see margaret cadaver, arid
we had a long talk and that's when i found out how she met my father. it was
painful to talk with her, and i even cried in front of her, but afterwards i
understood why my father liked to be with her.

   ben was sitting on my front steps when i got home. i was extensively glad
to see him. he said, 'i brought you something. it's out back.' he led me
around the side of the house and there, strutting across that little patch of
grass, was a chicken. i was never in my life so happy to see a
