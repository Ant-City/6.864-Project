duke.
if music be the food of love, play on;
give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,
the appetite may sicken and so die.
that strain again! it had a dying fall;
o, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound
that breathe

ent. i'll serve this duke:
thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him;
it may be worth thy pains, for i can sing
and speak to him in many sorts of music
that will allow me very worth his service.
what else may hap, to time i will commit;
only shape thou silence to my wit.

captain.
be you his eunuch, and your mute i'll be;
when my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.

viola.
i thank thee; lead me on.

scene iii.

olivia's house.

[enter sir toby belch and maria.]

sir toby.
what a plague means my niece, to take the death of her brother
thus? i am sure care's an enemy to life.

maria.
by my troth, sir toby, you must come in earlier o' nights; your
cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours.

sir toby.
why, let her except before excepted.

maria.
ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of
order.

sir toby.
confine! i'll confine myself no finer than i am. these clothes
are good enough to drink in, and

so be these boots too; and they

maria.
that quaffing and drinking will undo you. i heard my lady talk of
it yesterday, and of a foolish knight that you brought in one
night here to be her wooer.

sir toby.
who, sir andrew aguecheek?

maria.
ay, he.

sir toby.
he's as tall a man as any's in illyria.

maria.
what's that to th' purpose?

sir toby.
why, he has three thousand ducats a year.

maria.
ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats; he's a very
fool and a prodigal.

sir toby.
fie, that you'll say so! he plays o' th' viol-de-gamboys, and
speaks three or four languages word for word without book, and
hath all the good gifts of nature.

maria.
he hath indeed, almost natural; for, besides that he's a fool,
he's a great quarreller; and but that he hath the gift of a
coward to allay the gust he hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought
among the prudent he would quickly ha

him. who are they?

maria.
they that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company.

sir toby.
with drinking healths to my niece. i'll drink to her as long as
there is a passage in my throat and drink in illyria: he's a
coward and a coystrill that will not drink to my niece
till his brains turn o' th' toe like a parish-top. what, wench!
castiliano vulgo! for here comes sir andrew agueface.

what's that?

sir toby.
my niece's chambermaid.

sir andrew.
good mistress accost, i desire better acquaintance.

maria.
my name is mary, sir.

sir andrew.
good mistress mary accost,--

sir toby.
you mistake, knight; 'accost' is front her, board her, woo her,
assail her.

sir andrew.
by my troth, i would not undertake her in this company. is that
the meaning of 'accost'?

maria.
fare you well, gentlemen.

sir toby.
an thou let part so, sir andrew, would thou mightst never draw
sword again.

sir andrew.
and you part so, mistress, i would i might never draw sword
again. fair lady, do you thi

maria.
now, sir, 'thought is free.' i pray you, bring your hand to th'
buttery-bar and let it drink.

sir andrew.
wherefore, sweet-heart? what's your metaphor?

maria.
it's dry, sir.

sir andrew.
why, i think so; i am not such an ass but i can keep my hand dry.
but what's your jest?

maria.
a dry jest, sir.

sir andrew.
are you full of them?

maria.
ay, sir, i have them at my fingers' ends; marry, now i let go
your hand, i am barren.
[exit.]

sir toby.
o knight, thou lack'st a cup of canary; when did i see thee so
put down?

sir andrew.
never in your life, i think; unless you see canary put me down.
methinks sometimes i have no more wit than a christian or an
ordinary man has; but i am a great eater of beef, and i
believe that does harm to my wit.

will hang thee for thy absence.

maria.
yet you will be hang'd for being so long absent; or to be turn'd
away, is not that as good as a hanging to you?

clown.
many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and, for turning
away, let summer bear it out.

maria.
you are resolute, then?

clown.
not so, neither; but i am resolv'd on two points.

maria.
that, if one break, the other will hold; or, if both break, your
gaskins fall.

clown.

leave drinking, thou wert as witty a piece of eve's flesh as any

olivia.
o, you are sick of self-love, malvolio, and taste with a
distemper'd appetite. to be generous, guiltless, and of free
disposition, is to take those things for bird-bolts that you deem
cannon bullets. there is no slander in an allow'd fool, though he
do nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet man,
though he do nothing but reprove.

clown.
now mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou speak'st well of
fools!

maria.
madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to
speak with you.

olivia.

maria.
i know not, madam; 't is a fair young man, and well attended.

olivia.
who of my people hold him in delay?

maria.
sir toby, madam, your kinsman.

olivia.
fetch him off, i pray you; he speaks nothing but madman: fie on

of what personage and years is he?

malvolio.
not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy; as a
squash is before 't is a peascod, or a codling when 't is almost
an apple: 't is with him in standing water, between boy and man.
he is very well-favour'd, and he speaks very shrewishly; one
would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.

olivia.
it is the more like to be feign'd; i pray you, keep it in. i
heard you were saucy at my gates, and allow'd your approach
rather to wonder at you than to hear you. if you be not mad, be
gone; if you have reason, be brief; 't is not that time of moon

sir toby.
a false conclusion; i hate it as an unfill'd can. to be up after
midnight, and to go to bed then, is early; so that to go to bed
after midnight is to go to bed betimes. does not our life
consist of the four elements?

sir andrew.

drinking.

of faith that all that look on him love him; and on that vice in
him will my revenge find notable cause to work.

i will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love; wherein, by

can hardly make distinction of our hands.

he shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop, that they

maria.
he's coming, madam, but in very strange manner.
he is, sure, possess'd, madam.

why, what's the matter? does he rave?

maria.
no, madam, he does nothing but smile. your ladyship were best to

how now malvolio!

malvolio.
sweet lady, ho, ho.

olivia.
smil'st thou?
i sent for thee upon a sad occasion.

malvolio.
sad, lady! i could be sad; this does make some obstruction in the
blood, this cross-gartering; but what of that? if it please the
eye of one, it is with me as the very true
sonnet is, 'please one, and please all.'

wilt thou go to bed, malvolio?

malvolio.
to bed! ay, sweet-heart, and i'll come to thee.

olivia.
god comfort thee! why dost thou smile so and kiss thy hand so
oft?

maria.
how do you, malvolio?

malvolio.
at your request! yes; nightingales answer daws.

maria.
why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?

malvolio.
'be not afraid of greatness'; 'twas well writ.

olivia.
what mean'st thou by that, malvolio?

malvolio.
'some are born great,'--

olivia.
ha!

malvolio.
'some achieve greatness,'--

olivia.
what say'st thou?

malvolio.
'and some have greatness thrust upon them.'

olivia.

madam, the young gentleman of the count orsino's is return'd: i
could hardly entreat him back: he attends your ladyship's
pleasure.

olivia.
i'll come to him. [exit servant] good maria, let this fellow be
look'd to. where's my cousin toby? let some of my people have a
special care of him; i would not have him miscarry for the half
of my dowry.

[exeunt olivia and maria.]

malvolio.
o, ho! do you come near me now? no worse man than sir toby to
look to me! this concurs directly with the letter: she sends him
on purpose, that i may appear stubborn to him; for she incites me
to that in the letter. 'cast thy humble slough,' says she; 'be

jove's doing, and jove make me thankful! and when she went away
now, 'let this fellow be look'd to'; fellow! not malvolio, nor
after my degree, but fellow. why, every thing adheres together,
that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no obstacle,
no incredulous or unsafe circumstance,-- what can be said?
nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of
my hopes. well, jove, not i, is the doer of this, and he is to be
thank'd.

sir toby.
which way is he, in the name of sanctity? if all the devils of
hell be drawn in little, and legion himself possessed him, yet i
'll speak to him.

fabian.
here he is, here he is. how is 't with you, sir? how is 't with
you, man?

malvolio.
go off; i discard you: let me enjoy my private; go off.

maria.
lo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! did not i tell you?
sir toby, my lady prays you to have a care of him.

malvolio.
ah, ha! doe

s she so?

sir toby.
go to, go to; peace, peace; we must deal gently with him: let me
alone. how do you, malvolio? how is 't with you? what, man! defy
the devil; consider, he 's an enemy to mankind.

malvolio.
do you know what you say?

maria.
la you, and you speak ill of the devil, how he takes it at heart!
pray god, he be not bewitch'd! my lady would not lose him for
more than i 'll say.

malvolio.
how now, mistress!

maria.
o lord!

sir toby.
prithee, hold thy peace; this is not the way: do you not see you
move him? let me alone with him.

fabian.
no way but gentleness; gently, gently: the fiend is rough, and
will not be roughly us'd.

sir toby.
why, how now, my bawcock! how dost thou, chuck?

malvolio.

your element; you shall know more hereafter.

sir toby.

fabian.
if this were play'd upon a stage now, i could condemn it as an
improbable fiction.

sir toby.
his very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man.

maria.
nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint.

fabian.
why, we shall make him mad indeed.

maria.
the house will be the quieter.

sir toby.
come, we 'll have him in a dark room and bound. my niece is
already in the belief that he 's mad: we may carry it thus, for
our pleasure and his penance, till our very pastime, tired out of
breath, prompt us to have mercy on him; at which time we will
bring the device to the bar, and crown thee for a finder of
madmen. but see, but

go, sir andrew; scout me for him at the corner of the orchard,
like a bum-baily. so soon as ever thou see'st him, draw; and as
thou drawest, swear horrible; for it comes to pass oft, that a
