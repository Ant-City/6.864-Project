Prison Chaplain - 
                Played
by Godfrey Quigley
                The voice of tradition, he
takes Alex under his wing while Alex is in prison. The prison chaplain
preaches about good, evil, and freedom of choice, and he opposes
the use of modern scientific methods to control human behavior.
He is foolish and ineffective, preaching fire and brimstone to the
convicts while they burp, fart, and leer. He also mistakenly believes
in Alex's act of sincere reform. However, he is one of the few people
in the film who speak out against the power of the state.
