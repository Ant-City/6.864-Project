[CHARACTER]
the charismatic, capable, and aristocratic wynand straddles
the line between mainstream society and roark's world, and this
division makes him the novel's tragic figure. like roark, wynand
has extraordinary capabilities and energy, but unlike roark he lets
the world corrupt him. when we first meet wynand, he is entirely
a man of the outside world, exclusively involved with society and
its interests. his youthful idealism has been crushed by the world's
cynicism. wynand makes his living with newspapers that report on
the vulgar and the common. this involvement with the world leaves wynand
misanthropic, bored, and suicidal. wynand's worldview changes when
he meets dominique and roark, who ignite the passion and integrity
lingering within wynand. during roark's trial wynand fights the
world again and tries to turn his life around. he eventually feels
that he cannot escape the ugliness he has created. tragically, wynand
compromises at the last minute and loses his last chance at salvation.
