e, singing, "i found my thrill on 
blueberry hill." i watched unseen from the doorway, not 
making  a  sound,  but  when  he  launched  into  "viva  las 
vegas,"  slinging  his  hips  around  elvis-style,  i  broke  out 
laughing. 

he whirled around, knocking over a tray of brood 

frames, which made a great big mess all over the floor. 

"i was just singing," he said, like this was news to

"who are you anyway?" 
"lily,"  i said. "i'm staying with august and them 

for a while." 

"i'm zachary taylor," he said.
