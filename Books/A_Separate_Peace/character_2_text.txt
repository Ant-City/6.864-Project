ow that tree  i knew, mr. prudhomme must have known, finny knew, if he stopped to think, that jumping out of the tree was even more forbidden than missing a meal. we had to do that, naturally, he went on, because were all getting ready for the war. what if they lower the draft age to seventeen? gene and i are both going to be seventeen at the end of the summer, which is a very convenient time since its the start of the academic year and theres never any doubt about which class you should be in. leper lepellier is already seventeen, and if im not mistaken he will be draftable before the end of this next academic year, and so conceivably he ought to have been in the class ahead, he ought to have been a senior now, if you see what i mean, so that he would have been graduated and been all set to be drafted. but were all right, gene and i are perfectly all right. there isnt any question that we are conforming in every possible way to everything thats happening and everything thats going to happen. its all

doubled back closer to me for protection. knock him down, finny yelled at me.knock him down! are you crazy? hes on my team!there arent any teams in blitzball, he yelled somewhat irritably, were all enemies. knock him down!i knocked him down. all right, said finny as he disentangled us. now you have possession again. he handed the leaden ball to me.i would have thought that possession passednaturally you gained possession of the ball when you knocked him down. run.so i began running again. leper lepellier was loping along outside my perimeter, not noticing the game, taggling along without reason, like a porpoise escorting a passing ship. leper! i threw the ball past a few heads at him.taken by surprise, leper looked up in anguish, shrank away from the ball, and voiced his first thought, a typical one. i dont want it!stop, stop! cried finny in a referees tone. everybody halted, and finny retrieved the ball; he talked better holding it. now leper has just brought out a really important fine poin

tion was announced for one friday late in august. finny and i studied for it in the library thursday afternoon; i went over vocabulary lists, and he wrote messagesje ne give a damn pas about le francais, les filles en france ne wear pas les pantelonsand passed them with great seriousness to me, as aide-mmoire. of course i didnt get any work done. after supper i went to our room to try again. phineas came in a couple of minutes later.arise, he began airily, senior overseer charter member! elwin leper lepellier has announced his intention to make the leap this very night, to qualify, to save his face at last.i didnt believe it for a second. leper lepellier would go down paralyzed with panic on any sinking troopship before making such a jump. finny had put him up to it, to finish me for good on the exam. i turned around with elaborate resignation. if he jumps out of that tree im mahatma gandhi.all right, agreed finny absently. he had a way of turning cliches inside out like that. come on, lets go. we

, the dormitories were as noisy as factories, every bulletin board was a forest of notices.we had been an idiosyncratic, leaderless band in the summer, undirected except by the eccentric notions of phineas. now the official class leaders and politicians could be seen taking charge, assuming as a matter of course their control of these walks and fields which had belonged only to us. i had the same room which finny and i had shared during the summer, but across the hall, in the large suite where leper lepellier had dreamed his way through july and august amid sunshine and dust motes and windows through which the ivy had reached tentatively into the room, here brinker hadley had established his headquarters. emissaries were already dropping in to confer with him. leper, luckless in his last year as all the others, had been moved to a room lost in an old building off somewhere in the trees toward the gym.after morning classes and lunch i went across to see brinker, started into the room and then stoppe

 true. the school was thinly blanketed that night, but the next morning, a bright, almost balmy day, every flake disappeared. the following weekend, however, it snowed again, then two days later much harder, and by the end of that week the ground had been clamped under snow for the winter.in the same way the war, beginning almost humorously with announcements about maids and days spent at apple-picking, commenced its invasion of the school. the early snow was commandeered as its advance guard.leper lepellier didnt suspect this. it was not in fact evident to anyone at first. but leper stands out for me as the person who was most often and most emphatically taken by surprise, by this and every other shift in our life at devon.the heavy snow paralyzed the railroad yards of one of the large towns south of us on the boston and maine line. at chapel the day following the heaviest snowfall, two hundred volunteers were solicited to spend the day shoveling them out, as part of the emergency usefulness poli

 for hours, and sometimes for days, i fell without realizing it into the private explanation of the world. not that i ever believed that the whole production of world war ii was a trick of the eye manipulated by a bunch of calculating fat old men, appealing though this idea was. what deceived me was my own happiness; for peace is indivisible, and the surrounding world confusion found no reflection inside me. so i ceased to have any real sense of it.this was not shaken even by the enlistment of leper lepellier. in fact that made the war seem more unreal than ever. no real war could draw leper voluntarily away from his snails and beaver dams. his enlistment seemed just another of lepers vagaries, such as the time he slept on top of mount katahdin in maine where each morning the sun first strikes united states territory. on that morning, satisfying one of his urges to participate in nature, leper lepellier was the first thing the rising sun struck in the united states.early in january, when we had all

 you! give it to me, brownie, ill read it aloud to this assembled host. and it was this which drained away as i watched finnys face pass through all the gradations between uproariousness and shock.i took the telegram from phineas, facing in advance whatever the destruction was. that was what i learned to do that winter.ihave escaped and need help.i am at christmas location. you understand. no need to risk address here. my safety depends on you coming at once.(signed) your best friend, elwin leper lepellier.chapter 10that night i made for the first time the land of journey which later became the monotonous routine of my life: traveling through an unknown countryside from one unknown settlement to another. the next year this became the dominant activity, or rather passivity, of my army career, not fighting, not marching, but this kind of nighttime ricochet; for as it turned out i never got to the war.i went into uniform at the time when our enemies began to recede so fast that there had to be a

n done before, holding hands in a jump then it was as though someone suddenly slapped him. no, that was on the ground when i said that to you. i said that to you on the ground, and then the two of us started to climb  he broke off.the two of you, the boy on the platform went on harshly for him, started to climb up the tree together, was that it? and hes just said he was on the ground!or on the rungs! i burst out. i said i might have been on the rungs!who else was there? said brinker quietly. leper lepellier was there, wasnt he?yes, someone said, leper was there.leper always was the exact type when it came to details, continued brinker. he could have told us where everybody was standing, what everybody was wearing, the whole conversation that day, and what the temperature was. he could have cleared the whole thing up. too bad.no one said anything. phineas had been sitting motionless, leaning slightly forward, not far from the position in which we prayed at devon. after a long time he turned and
