Timon - 
      
        Timon of Athens is the title character in Shakespeare's Timon of Athens. Beginning the play as a wealthy man, Timon enjoys giving gifts to his friends and sharing his wealth. He believes that friendship means giving to his friends, without expecting something in return. Timon's servants all await the day when Timon's bounty runs out, for Timon has spent all of his money and more without listening to their reports about the status of his accounts. When creditors show up asking for payment on his debts, Timon finally listens, and discovers that he is bankrupt. He sends servants to his friends to ask for loans, but all come back empty-handed. Convinced all humanity has turned against him, Timon declares his hatred for mankind and takes off for the forest, where, to his dismay, he becomes a sought-after guru-like figure, and he discovers a hidden stash of gold. People constantly want to contact him, though his only discourse consists of curses for flatterers and false friends. Timon ends his days filled with bile at mankind.
