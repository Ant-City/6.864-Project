 by dr. chiera,
[38] there can be no doubt that huwawa or hubaba is a west semitic
name. this important fact adds to the probability that the "cedar
forest" in which huwawa dwells is none other than the lebanon district,
famed since early antiquity for its cedars. this explanation of the
name huwawa disposes of suppositions hitherto brought forward for an
elamitic origin. gressmann [39] still favors such an origin, though
realizing that the description of the cedar forest points to the amanus
or lebanon range. in further confirmation of the west semitic origin of
the name, we have in lucian, _de dea syria_, § 19, the name kombabos
[40] (the guardian of stratonika), which forms a perfect parallel to
hu(m)baba. of the important bearings of this western character of the
name huwawa on the interpretation and origin of the gilgamesh epic,
suggesting that the episode of the encounter between the tyrant and
the two heroes rests upon a tradition of an expedition against the
west o

again, as a further indication that enkidu is the real conqueror of
huwawa, we find the coming contest revealed to enkidu no less than
three times in dreams, which gilgamesh interprets. [91] since the
person who dreams is always the one to whom the dream applies, we may
see in these dreams a further trace of the primary rôle originally
assigned to enkidu.

another exploit which, according to the assyrian version, the two
heroes perform in concert is the killing of a bull, sent by anu at
the instance of ishtar to avenge an insult offered to the goddess
by gilgamesh, who rejects her offer of marriage. in the fragmentary
description of the contest with the bull, we find enkidu "seizing"
the monster by "its tail." [92]

that enkidu originally played the part of the slayer is also shown
by the statement that it is he who insults ishtar by throwing a
piece of the carcass into the goddess' face, [93] adding also an
insulting speech; and this despite the fact that ishtar i

lgamesh's dream, portending the meeting with enkidu,
nothing is said of the woman who is the companion of the latter. the
passage in which enkidu is created by aruru to oppose gilgamesh [102]
betrays evidence of having been worked over in order to bring enkidu
into association with the longing of the people of erech to get rid
of a tyrannical character. the people in their distress appeal to
aruru to create a rival to gilgamesh. in response,


	"aruru upon hearing this created a man of anu in her heart."


now this "man of anu" cannot possibly be enkidu, for the sufficient
reason that a few lines further on enkidu is described as an offspring
of ninib. moreover, the being created is not a "counterpart"
of gilgamesh, but an animal-man, as the description that follows
shows. we must separate lines 30-33 in which the creation of the "anu
man" is described from lines 34-41 in which the creation of enkidu is
narrated. indeed, these lines strike one as the proper _beginning_

ackground to the episode
is a failure. the goddess ishtar symbolizes the earth which woos the
sun in the spring, but whose love is fatal, for after a few months
the sun's power begins to wane. gilgamesh, who in incantation hymns
is invoked in terms which show that he was conceived as a sun-god,
[117] recalls to the goddess how she changed her lovers into animals,
like circe of greek mythology, and brought them to grief. enraged at
gilgamesh's insult to her vanity, she flies to her father anu and cries
for revenge. at this point the episode of the creation of the bull is
introduced, but if the analysis above given is correct it is enkidu
who is the hero in dispatching the bull, and we must assume that the
sickness with which gilgamesh is smitten is the punishment sent by anu
to avenge the insult to his daughter. this sickness symbolizes the
waning strength of the sun after midsummer is past. the sun recedes
from the earth, and this was pictured in the myth as the sun-god's

ng out their adventures in common,
it is because in the process of combination gilgamesh becomes the
_reflex_ of enkidu. that enkidu is not the figure created by aruru to
relieve erech of its tyrannical ruler is also shown by the fact that
gilgamesh remains in control of erech. it is to erech that he returns
when he fails of his purpose to learn the secret of escape from old
age and death. erech is, therefore, not relieved of the presence of
the ruthless ruler through enkidu. the "man of anu" formed by aruru
as a deliverer is confused in the course of the growth of the epic
with enkidu, the offspring of ninib, and in this way we obtain the
strange contradiction of enkidu and gilgamesh appearing first as bitter
rivals and then as close and inseparable friends. it is of the nature
of epic compositions everywhere to eliminate unnecessary figures by
concentrating on one favorite the traits belonging to another or to
several others.

6-48 of the pennsylvania tablet form a complete parallel to line 21
of column 4 of the assyrian version. the description in lines 22-32
of column 4 is missing, though it may, of course, have been included
in part in the recital in the first tablet of the old babylonian
version. lines 49-59 of the pennsylvania tablet are covered by 33-39,
the only slight difference being the specific mention in line 58 of
the pennsylvania tablet of eanna, the temple in erech, described as
"the dwelling of anu," whereas in the assyrian version eanna is merely
referred to as the "holy house" and described as "the dwelling of
anu and ishtar," where ishtar is clearly a later addition.

leaving aside lines 60-61, which may be merely a variant (though
independent) of line 39 of column 4 of the assyrian version, we now
have in the pennsylvania tablet a second speech of the woman to enkidu
(not represented in the assyrian version) beginning like the first
one with _alka_, "come" (lines 62-63), in wh

line 6. _ka-ka-bu sá-ma-i_ must be taken as a compound term for
"starry heaven." the parallel passage in the assyrian version (tablet
i, 5, 27) has the ideograph for star, with the plural sign as a
variant. literally, therefore, "the starry heaven (or "the stars in
heaven") was there," etc. langdon's note 2 on page 211 rests on an
erroneous reading.

line 7. _kisru sá anim_, "mass of anu," appears to be the designation
of a meteor, which might well be described as a "mass" coming from anu,
i.e., from the god of heaven who becomes the personification of the
heavens in general. in the assyrian version (i, 5, 28) we have _kima
ki-is-rù_, i.e., "something like a mass of heaven." note also i, 3,
16, where in a description of gilgamesh, his strength is said to be
"strong like a mass (i.e., a meteor) of heaven."

line 162. while the restoration _belê_, "weapon," is purely
conjectural, the context clearly demands some such word. i choose
_belê_ in preference to _kakkê_, in view of the assyrian version,
tablet vi, 1.

line 163. _putuku_ (or _putukku_) from _patâku_ would be an appropriate
word for the fabrication of weapons.

line 165. the _rabûtim_ here, as in line 167, i take as the "master
mechanics" as contrasted with the _ummianu_, "common workmen," or
journeymen. a parallel to this forging of the weapons for the two
heroes is to be found in the sumerian fragment of the gilgamesh epic
published by langdon, _historical and religious texts from the temple
library of nippur_ (munich, 1914), no. 55, 1-15.

lines 168-170 describe the forging of the various parts of the
lances for the two heroes. the _sipru_ is the spear point muss-arnolt,
