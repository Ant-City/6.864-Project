[CHARACTER] - 
                 a
laborer in his late twenties who often works in the vicinity of
thoreau's abode. thoreau describes therien as "a canadian, a wood-chopper
and post-maker," asserting that it would be difficult to find a more
simple or natural human being. although he is not a reader, therien
is nevertheless conversant and intelligent, and thus he holds great
appeal for thoreau as a sort of untutored backwoods sage. thoreau compares
the woodcutter to walden pond itself, saying both possess hidden
depths.
