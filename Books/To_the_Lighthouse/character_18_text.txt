nless in the sun. now and then
the sails rippled with a little breeze in them, but the ripple ran over
them and ceased. the boat made no motion at all. mr. ramsay sat in the
middle of the boat. he would be impatient in a moment, james thought,
and cam thought, looking at her father, who sat in the middle of the
boat between them (james steered; cam sat alone in the bow) with his
legs tightly curled. he hated hanging about. sure enough, after
fidgeting a second or two, he said something sharp to macalister's boy,
who got out his oars and began to row. but their father, they knew,
would never be content until they were flying along. he would keep
looking for a breeze, fidgeting, saying things under his breath, which
macalister and and macalister's boy would overhear, and they would both
be made horribly uncomfortable. he had made them come. he had forced
them to come. in their anger they hoped that the breeze would never
rise, that he might be thwarted in every possible way, since he had
forced them to

 to the death. so there they would sit, one
at one end of the boat, one at the other, in silence. they would say
nothing, only look at him now and then where he sat with his legs
twisted, frowning and fidgeting, and pishing and pshawing and muttering
things to himself, and waiting impatiently for a breeze. and they
hoped it would be calm. they hoped he would be thwarted. they hoped
the whole expedition would fail, and they would have to put back, with
their parcels, to the beach.

but now, when macalister's boy had rowed a little way out, the sails
slowly swung round, the boat quickened itself, flattened itself, and
shot off. instantly, as if some great strain had been relieved, mr.
ramsay uncurled his legs, took out his tobacco pouch, handed it with a
little grunt to macalister, and felt, they knew, for all they suffered,
perfectly content. now they would sail on for hours like this, and mr.
ramsay would ask old macalister a question--about the great storm
last winter probably--and old macalister wou

ng in his pocket for a book. but she would answer
him; she wished, passionately, to move some obstacle that lay upon her
tongue and to say, oh, yes, frisk. i'll call him frisk. she wanted
even to say, was that the dog that found its way over the moor alone?
but try as she might, she could think of nothing to say like that,
fierce and loyal to the compact, yet passing on to her father,
unsuspected by james, a private token of the love she felt for him.
for she thought, dabbling her hand (and now macalister's boy had caught
a mackerel, and it lay kicking on the floor, with blood on its gills)
for she thought, looking at james who kept his eyes dispassionately on
the sail, or glanced now and then for a second at the horizon, you're
not exposed to it, to this pressure and division of feeling, this
extraordinary temptation. her father was feeling in his pockets; in
another second, he would have found his book. for no one attracted her
more; his hands were beautiful, and his feet, and his voice, and his

known? for one
moment she felt that if they both got up, here, now on the lawn, and
demanded an explanation, why was it so short, why was it so
inexplicable, said it with violence, as two fully equipped human beings
from whom nothing should be hid might speak, then, beauty would roll
itself up; the space would fill; those empty flourishes would form into
shape; if they shouted loud enough mrs. ramsay would return. "mrs.
ramsay!" she said aloud, "mrs. ramsay!" the tears ran down her face.

[macalister's boy took one of the fish and cut a square out of its side
to bait his hook with. the mutilated body (it was alive still) was
thrown back into the sea.]

"mrs. ramsay!" lily cried, "mrs. ramsay!" but nothing happened. the pain
increased. that anguish could reduce one to such a pitch of
imbecility, she thought! anyhow the old man had not heard her. he
remained benignant, calm--if one chose to think it, sublime. heaven be
praised, no one had heard her cry that ignominious cry, stop pain,
stop! sh

 not waste it. he said it so wisely, as if he knew so well all
the things that happened in the world that she put it back at once, and
then he gave her, from his own parcel, a gingerbread nut, as if he were
a great spanish gentleman, she thought, handing a flower to a lady at a
window (so courteous his manner was). he was shabby, and simple,
eating bread and cheese; and yet he was leading them on a great
expedition where, for all she knew, they would be drowned.

"that was where she sunk," said macalister's boy suddenly.

three men were drowned where we are now, the old man said. he had seen
them clinging to the mast himself. and mr. ramsay taking a look at the
spot was about, james and cam were afraid, to burst out:

and if he did, they could not bear it; they would shriek aloud; they
could not endure another explosion of the passion that boiled in him;
but to their surprise all he said was "ah" as if he thought to himself.
but why make a fuss about that? naturally men
