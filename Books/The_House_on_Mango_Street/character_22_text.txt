the 
house 
on 
mango 
street 

we  didn't always  live  on  mango street.  before  that 
we lived on loomis on the third floor, and before that we 
lived on keeler.  before keeler it was  paulina, and before 
that i can't remember. but what i remember most is mov­
ing a lot.  each  time it seemed there'd be one more of us. 
by  the time we  got to mango street we  were six-mama, 
papa, carlos,  kiki,  my  sister nenny and me. 

the house on mango street is ours, and we don't have 
to pay rent to anybody, or share the yard with the people 
downstairs, or be careful not to make too much noise, and 
there isn't a landlord banging on the ceiling with a broom. 
but even so,  it's not the house we'd  thought we'd  get.

there.  i nodded.
 

i knew then i had to have a house. a real house. one
 
i  could  point  to.  but  this  isn't  it.  the  house  on  mango
 
street isn't it.  for the time being,  mama says. temporary,
 
says  papa.  but i know  how  those things go.

. . . . and that's why we  moved into the house on mango 
screet. far away,  on the other side of town. 

they always told us that one day we would move into

 that would be ours for always so we 
wouldn't  have  to  move  each  year.  and  our house  would 
have running water and pipes that worked.  and inside it 
would have real stairs,  not hallway stairs,  but stairs inside 
like the houses on t.v. and we'd have a basement and at 
1casl three washrooms so when we took a bath we wouldn't 
have to tell everybody. our house would be white with trees 
around it,  a  great  big  yard  and  grass  growing  without a 
fence. this was the house papa talked about when he held 
a lottery ticket and this was  the house mama dreamed up 
in  the stories she told us before we  went to  bed. 

but the  house on  mango street is  not the  way  they 
told it at all.  it's small and red with tight steps in front and 
windows  so  small  you'd  think  they  were  holding  their 
breath. bricks are crumbling in places, and the front door 
is so swollen you have to push hard to get in. there is  no 
front yard, only four little elms the city planted by the c

out  back  is  a  small  garage  for  the  car we  don't  own  yet 
and a small yard that looks smaller between the two build­

they're ordinary hallway stairs, and the house has only one 
washroom. everybody has to share a bedroom-mama and 
papa, carlos and kiki,  me and nenny. 

once when we were living on loomis, a nun from my 
school passed by and saw  me playing out front.  the laun­

everybody looked inside the car and asked where he 
got it.  there were white  rugs and white leather seats.  we 
all asked for a ride and asked where he got it. louie's cousin 
said  get in. 

we each had to sit with one of louie's little sisters on 
our lap, but that was okay. the seats were big and soft like 
a sofa,  and there was  a little white cat in the back window 
whose  eyes  lit  up  when  the  car stopped  or  turned.  the

we never see  marin until her aunt comes home from 
work, and even then she can only stay out in front. she is 
there  every  night  with  the  radio.  when  the  light  in  her 
aunt's room goes out, marin lights a cigarette and it doesn't 
matter if it's cold out or if the tadio doesn't work or if we've 
got nothing to say to each other. what matters, marin says, 
is  for the boys  to see us and for us  to see  them. and since 
marin's  skirts  are  shorte'  and  since  her  eyes  are  pretty, 
and since marin is already older than us in many ways,  the 
boys who do pass by say stupid things like i am in love with 
those two green apples you call eyes, give  them to me why 
don't you. and marin just looks at them without even blink­
ing and is  not afraid. 

marin,  under  the  streetlight,  dancing  by  herself,  is 
singing  the same song somewhere.  i  know.  is  waiting  for 
a car to stop, a  star to fall,  someone to change  her life.

you can never have too much sky. you can fall asleep 
and wake up drunk on sky, and sky can keep you safe when 
you  are  sad.  here  there  is  too  much  sadness  and  not 
enough sky.  butterflies too are few and so are flowers and 
most  things  that are beautiful.  still,  we  take  what we  can 
get and make  the best of it.

of little feet  • 

there was  a  famil
 
 ___________________________
 
y.  all  were little.  their arms were 
little,  and their hands were little, and their height was  not 
tall,  and  their feet  very small. 

the  grandpa  slept  on  the  living  room  couch  and 
snored  through  his  teeth.  his  feet  were  fat  and  doughy 
like thick tamales, and these he powdered and stuffed into 
white socks and  brown leather shoes. 

the  grandma's  feet  were  lovely  as  pink  pearls  and 
dressed  in  velvety  high  heels  that  made  her walk  with  a 
wobble,  but  she  wore  them  anyway  because  they  were 
pretty. 

the baby's feet had ten tiny toes, pale and see-through 

r i 

like  a  salamander's. and  these  he  popped  into  his  mouth 
whenever  he  was  hungry. 

the mother's feet,  plump and polite. descended like 
white  pigeons from  the sea of pillow,  across  the linoleum 
roses,  down down  the wooden stairs,  over the chalk  hop­
scotch squares,  5,6, 7,  blue sky. 

do you  want this?  and gave  us a  paper bag with one 

pair 
 
 ___________________________
 
 of lemon  shoes  and  one  red  and  one  pair  of danc­
ing shoes  that  used  to  be  white  but were  now  pale  blue. 
here,  and  we  said  thank  you  and  waited  until  she  went 
upstairs. 

hurray! today we  are cinderella because our feet fit 
exactly, and we laugh at rachel's one foot with a girl's grey 
sock  and  a  lady's  high  heel.  do you  like  these shoes?  but 
the truth  is  it  is  scary to look  down at your foot  that is  no 
longer yours and  s~e  attached a  long long leg. 

everybody  wants  to  trade.  the lemon  shoes  for  the 
red  shoes,  the  red  for  the  pair  that were  once  white  but 
are  now  pale  blue,  the  pale  blue  for  the  lemon, and  take 
them  off and  put  them  back  on  and  keep  on  like  this  a 
long time until we  are tired. 

then lucy  screams to take our socks off and yes,  it's 
true.  we  have  legs.  skinny  and  spotted  with  satin  scars 
where  scabs  were  picked,  but  legs,  all  our  own,  good

look  at,  and  long. 

it's  rachel  who learns to walk the best all  strutted in 
those magic high heels. she teaches us to cross and uncross 
our legs, and to run like a double-dutch rope, and how to 
walk down to the corner so that the shoes talk back  to you 
with  every  step.  lucy,  rachel,  me  tee-tottering  like  so. 
down  to  the  corner  where  the  men  can't  take  their eyes 
off us.  we  must be crristmas.

we  are  running  fast  and  far  away,  our  high  heel  shoes

street, the back way, just in  case. 

we are tired of being beautiful. lucy hides the lemon 
shoes and the red shoes and the shoes that used to be white 
but are now  pale blue under a  powerful bushel basket on 
the back porch, until one tuesday her mother, who is very 
clean, throws them away.  but no one complains. 

i 

portant cigar:  your mother know you  got  shoes like  that? 
who  give  you  those? 

nobody. 
them are dangerous, he says.  you girls too young to 
he  wearing  shoes  like  that.  take  them  shoes off before  i 
call  the cops,  but we just run. 

on the avenue a boy on a homemade bicycle calls out: 

ladies,  lead  me to  heaven. 

but there is  nobody around but us. 
do  you  like  these  shoes?  rachel  says  yes,  and  lucy 
says  yes,  and  yes  i  say,  these  are  the  best  shoes.  we  will 
never go back to wearing the other kind again. do you like 
these shoes?

on  the stoop. 

do  you  like  these shoes? 
bum man says,  yes,  little girl. your little lemon shoes 
are so beautiful. but come closer. i can't see very well. come 
closer.  please. 

you are a pretty girl, bum man continues. what's your 

name,  pretty girl? 

and  rachel  says  rachel, just like that. 
now  you  know  to  talk  to  drunks is  crazy  and  to  tell 
them  your name  is  worse,  but who can blame her.  she  is 
young and dizzy  to hear so many sweet things in one day, 
even  if it  is  a bum man's whiskey  words saying them. 

rachel,  you  are  prettier  than  a  yellow  taxicab.  you 

know  that? 

but we  don't like  it.  we  got to go,  lucy  says.

i'm no spartan and hold up an anemic wrist to prove

and so  i  went. 

i had to wait for two kids in front of me to get hollered

he  didn't.  my  turn came and  i  stood  in  front  of the  big

three  long  blocks  away  from  here.  i  bet  i  can  see  your

and then she  made me stand  up on a  box of books

three-flats, the ones even the raggedy men are ashamed to

there was  no evil in  her birth. no wicked curse. one day 
i believe she was swimming, and the next day she was sick. 
it might have been the day that gray photograph was taken. 
it might have been the day she was holding cousin totchy 
and  baby  frank.  it  might  have  been  the  moment  she 
pointed  to  the  camera  for  the  kids  to  look  and  they 
wouldn't. 

maybe  the  sky  didn't  look  the  day  she  fell  down. 
maybe god was busy.  it could be true she didn't dive right 
one day  and  hurt her spine.  or maybe the story that she 
fell  very  hard  from  a  high  step stool,  like  totchy said,  is 
true. 

but  i  think diseases  have  no eyes.  they pick  with  a 

dizzy  finger  anyone, just anyone.  like  my  aunt who hap­
pened to be  walking down  the street one day in her joan

cousin totchy in  one hand, baby  frank in  the other.

lucy, me, rachel.  i hated to go there alone. the six blocks 
to  the  dark  apartment,  second-floor  rear building where 
sunlight never came, and what did it matter? my  aunt was 
blind by  then. she  never saw  the dirty dishes in the sink. 
she couldn't see the ceilings dusty with flies,  the ugly  ma­
roon walls, the bottles and sticky spoons. i can't forget the 
smell.  like sticky capsules filled  with jelly. my aunt, a little 
oyster, a little piece of meat on an open shell for  us  to look 
at.  hello,  hello.  as  if she had fallen  into a well. 

i  took  my  librctry  books to her house.  i read her sto­

ries.  i  liked  the  book  the  waterbabies.  she  liked  it  too.  i 
never knew how sick she was  until that day i tried to show 
her one of the pictures in the book, a beautiful color picture 
of the  water babies swimming in  the sea.  i  held  the book 
up to her face.  i can't see it,  she said,  i'm blind. and then 
i  was ashamed.

one  day  i  memorized  all  of "the  walrus  and  the

was  shining  on  the  sea,  shining  with  all  his  might ..." 
ruthie looked at the sky  and her eyes got watery at times. 
finally  i  came  to  the  last  lines:  "but answer came  there 
none-and  this  was  scarcely  odd,  because  they'd  eaten

she  opened  her  mouth, and  then  she said,  you  have  the 
most beautiful teeth  i  have ever seen, and went inside.

go  everywhere  with  him.  they  don't  walk.  like  ordinary 
dogs,  but  leap  and  somersault  like  an  apostrophe  and

from work. first the click and whine of the car door open­
ing, then the scrape of concrete, the excited tinkling of dog 
tags, followed by  the heavy jingling of keys, and finally  the 
moan of the wooden door as it opens and lets loose its sigh 
of dampness. 

earl is  a jukebox repairman.  he learned his  trade in 
the  south,  he  says.  he  speaks  with  a  southern  accent, 
smokes fat cigars and wears a felt hat-winter or summer, 
hot or cold, don't matter-a felt hat.  in his apartment are 
boxes and boxes of 45 records,  moldy  and damp like  the 
smell that comes out of his apartment whenever he opens 
the door.  he gives the records away  to  us-all except the 
country and western. 

the word is that earl is married and has a wife some­

where. edna says she saw  her once when earl brought her 
to the apartment.  mama says  she is  a  skinny  thing,  blond 
and  pale  like  salamanders  that  have  never seen  the  sun. 
but i  saw  her once too and she's  not that way

the boys  across the street say she is  a  tall  red-headed lady 
who  wears  tight  pink  pants  and  green  glasses.  we  never 
agree on what she looks like, but we do know  this.  when­
ever  she  arrives,  he  holds  her  tight  by  the  crook of the 
arm.  they  walk  fast  into  the  apartment,  lock  the  door 
behind them and never stay long.

earl of 
tennessee 

earl  lives  next door in edna's  basement,  behind  the 
flower boxes edna paints green each year, behind the dusty 
geraniums. we used to sit on the flower boxes until the day 
tito saw a cockroach with a spot of green paint on its head. 
now  we  sit  on  the steps  that swing around  the  basement 
apartment where earl lives. 

earl works nights. his blinds are always closed during 
the day. sometimes he comes out and tells us to keep quiet. 
the little wooden door that has wedged shut the dark for 
so  long  opens  with  a  sigh  and  lets  out  a  breath  of mold 
and  dampness,  like  boo

sometimes  i  hear them laughing late, beer cans and

stops sometimes to tie her shoes. but mama says those kinds 
of girls,  those  girls  are  the  ones  that  go  into  alleys.  lois 
who can't tie  her shoes.  where does he take  her?

straight eyes.  i  walked  past.  i  knew  he was looking.  i  had 
to  prove to me i  wasn't scared of nooody's  eyes,  not even 
his.  i  had  to  look  back  hard, just once,  like  he  was  glass.

all  at once she bloomed.  huge, enormous, beautiful 
to look at, from the salmon-pink feather on the tip of her 
hat down  to the little rosebuds of her toes.  i couldn't take 
my  eyes off her tiny shoes. 

up, up, up the stairs she went with  the baby boy in a 
blue blanket, the man carrying her suitcases, her lavender 
hatboxes, a dozen boxes of satin high heels. then we didn't 
see her. 

somebody  said  because  she's  too  fat,  somebody be­

cause of the three flights of st3irs, but i believe she doesn't 
come out because she is afraid to speak english, and maybe 
this  is  so since she only knows  eight words. she knows  to 
say:  he  not  here  for  when  the  landlord  comes,  no  speak

hamandeggs for three months.  breakfast, lunch and din­
ner.  hamandeggs.  that was  the only  word  he  knew.  he 
doesn't eat hamandeggs anymore. 

whatever  her  reasons,  whether  she  is  fat,  or  can't 
climb  the  stairs,  or  is  afraid  of english,  she  won't  come 
down. she sits all day by the window and plays the spanish 
radio  show  and  sings  all  the  homesick  songs  about  her 
. country in  a  voice  that sounds like a  seagull.

pink  house,  pink as  hollyhocks  with  lots of startled light. 
the  man  paints  the  walls  of the apartment  pink,  but  it's 
not the same, you know. she still sighs for her pint house, 
and  then  i  think she cries.  i  would.

country.  he worked  two jobs.  he came home late and  he 
left early.  every day. 

then  one  day  mamacita  and  the  baby  boy  arrived

to that country. 

and  then  to  break  her  heart forever,  the baby  boy,

his  hands just like a dog, she said, like if i was  an animal. 
he thinks i'm going to run away like  his sisters who made
 
the family ashamed. just because i'm a daughter, and then

turning somersaults and humming in the air.  sweet sweet 
peach trees. thorn roses and thisde and pears. weeds like 
so many squinty-eyed stars an

there were  big  green  apples  hard  as  knees.  and  every­
where  the sleepy  smell  of rotting  wood,  damp earth and 
dusty  hollyhocks  thick  and  perfumy  like  the  blue-blond 
hair of the dead. 

yellow  spiders  ran  when  we  turned  rocks  over and 
pale  worms  blind  and  afraid  of light  rolled  over  in  their 
sleep. poke a stick in the sandy soil and a few blue-skinned 
beetles would  appear,  an avenue of ants,  so  many  crusty 
lady bugs. this was a garden, a wonderful thing to look at 
in  the	  spring.  but  bit  by  bit,  after  the  monkey  left,  the 
garden began to take over itself.  flowers stopped obeying 
the little bricks that kept them from growing beyond their 
paths. weeds mixed in. dead cars appeared overnight like 
mushrooms.  first one and  then another and  then a  pale 
blue pickup with the front windshield missing.  before you

things had a  way  of disappearing in  the garden,  as 
if the  garden  itself  ate  them,  or,  as  if  with  its  old-man 
memory, it put them away and forgot them. nenny found 
a dollar and a dead mouse between two rocks in the stone 
wall  where  the  morning  glories  climbed,  and  once  when 
we were playing hide-and-seek, eddie vargas laid his head 
beneath a  hibiscus tree and fell asleep there like a rip van 
winkle  until  somebody  remembered  he was  in  the game 
and went back to look for  him. 

this,  i  suppose,  was  the  reason why  we  went  there. 
far away  from where our mothers could find  us.  we and 
a  few  old dogs who lived inside the empty cars.  we made 
a clubhouse once on the ba~k of that old blue pickup. and

the monkey doesn't live there anymore. the monkey 
moved-to kentucky-and took his people with him. and 
i  was  glad  because  i  couldn't  listen  anymore  to  his  wild

and it was then we took over the garden we had been 
afraid to go into when the monkey screamed and showed 
its  yellow  teeth. 

there  were  sunflowers  big  as  flowers  on  mars  and 
thick cockscombs bleeding the deep red fringe  of theater

besides.  we liked to jump from the  roof of one car to an­
other and pretend they  were giant mushrooms. 

somebody started the lie that the monkey garden had 
been there before anything. we liked to think the garden 
could hide things for a thousand years. there beneath the 
roots of soggy flowers were the bones of murdered pirates 
and dinosaurs, the eye of a  unicorn turned to coal.

day  but  not even the  monkey  garden would  have  m

was  the last day  i  would go there. 

who was it that said i  was getting too old to play the 
games? who was it i didn't listen to? i only remember that 
when  the  others  ran,  i  wanted  to  run  too,  up and down 
and through the monkey garden, fast as the boys, not like 
sally  who screamed if she got her stockings muddy. 

i  said,  sally,  come on,  but she  wouldn't.  she stayed 
by  the curb talking to tito and his  friends.  play  with  the 
kids  if you want,  she said,  i'm staying here. she could be 
stuck-up like  that if she wanted to,  so i just left. 

i t  was  her own fault  too.  when i  got back sally  was 
pretending to be mad ... something about the boys having 
stolen  her  keys.  please  give  them  back  to  me,  she  said 
punching the nearest one with a soft fist. they were laugh­
ing.  she was  too.  it was a joke i  didn't get. 

i wanted to go back with the other kids who were still 

jumping on cars, still chasing each other through

 the gar­
den, but sally  had her own game. 

one  of the  boys  invented  the  rules.  one  of tito's 
friends  said you can't get the keys back unless you  kiss  us 
and sally  pretended to be  mad at first  but she said yes.  it 
was  that simple. 

i  don't know  why,  but something inside  me  wanted 
to  throw  a  stick.  something  wanted  to  say  no  when  i 
watched sally going into the garden with tito's buddies all 

grinning. it was just a  kiss,  that's all.  a  li.ss  for each  0de­
s<>  what, she said, 

only  how  come  i  felt  angry  inside.  like  something 
wasn't right. sally went behind that old blue pickup to usa 
the boys and get her keys back, and i  ran up three flights 
of stairs to where tito lived. his mother was ironing shirts. 
she was sprinkling water on them from an empty pop botde 
and smoking a cigarette. 

your son and  his  friends  stole  sally's  keys  and  now 
they won't give  them back unles she kisses them and right 
now  they're maki

from the three flights  of stairs. 

those kids, she said, not looking up from her ironing.
 
that's all?
 
what do you  want me to do, she said, call  the cops?
 

and kept on ironing. 

i  looked  at  her  a  long  time,  but  couldn't  think  of 
anything to say, and ran back down the three flights to the 
garden where  sally  needed  to be  saved.  i  took  three big 
sticks and a  brick and figured  this was  enough. 

but when i  got there sally said go home. those boys 
said  leave  us  alone.  i  felt  stupid with  my  brick.  they all 
looked at me as  if i  was  the one that was crazy and made 
me feel  ashamed. 

and then i don't know why but i  had to run away.  i 
had to hide myself at the other end of the garden, in the 
jungle part, under a tree that wouldn't mind if i lay down 
and cried a  long time.  i closed  my eyes ljke  tight stars  so

sally got married like we  knew she would, young and 

not  ready  but  married just  the  same.  she  met  a  marsh­
mallow  salesman  at a  school bazaar, and she married  him 
in another state where it's legal to get married before eighth 
grade. she has  her husband and  her house  now,  her pil­
lowcases and her plates. she says she is  in love, but i think 
she did it to escape. 

sally  says  she  likes  being  married  because  now  she 
gets  to  buy  her own  things  when  her husband  gives  her 
money. she is  happy, except sometimes  her husband gets 
angry  and  once  he  broke  the  door  where  his  foot  went

came to  look at that little thumb of a  human in a box like 
candy. 

i had never seen the dead before, not for real, not in 

somebody's living room  for  people to kiss  and bless them­
selves  and  light  a  candle  for.  not  in  a  house.  it seemed 
strange. 

they must've known, the sisters. they had the power 
and could sense what was what. they said, come here, and 
gave me a stick of gum. they smelled like  kleenex or the 
inside of a satin  handbag, and then  i didn't feel  afraid. 

what's your name,  the cat-eyed one asked.
 
esperanza,  i said.
 
esperanza, the old blue-veined one repeated in a high
 

thin voice.  esperanza ... a  good  good  name. 

my  knees  hurt,  the  one with  the  funny  laugh  com­

plained. 

tomorrow it  will  rain. 
yes,  tomorrow, they said. 
how do you  know?  i asked. 
we  know.

and they turned them over and over as  if they were 

looking for  something.

good, she said,  rubbing my  hands. good. that's all. 

you can go. 

i  got  up to join  lucy  and  rachel  who  were already 
outside waiting by  the door,  wondering what  i  was  doing 
talking  to  three old  ladies  who  smelled  like  cinnamon.  i 
didn't understand everything they  had  told  me.  i  turned 
around. they smiled and waved  in  their smoky way. 

then  i  didn't see  them.  not  once,  or twice,  or ever 

again.
