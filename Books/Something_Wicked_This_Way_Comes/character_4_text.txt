colour paper lay crushed, its rococo type hidden, in his father's fingers.
'hey!'
will stepped into the parlour.
immediately mom opened a smile that was like lighting a second fire.
dad stricken, looked dismayed, as if caught in a criminal act.
will wanted to say, 'hey, what'd you think of the handbillâ€¦?
but dad was cramming the handbill deep in the chair upholstery.
and mother was leafing the library books.
'oh, these are fine, willy!'
so will just stood with cooger and dark on his tongue and said:
'boy, the wind really flew us home.streets full of paper blowing.'
dad did not flinch at this.
'anything new, dad?'
dad's hand still lay tucked in the side of the chair. he lifted a grey, slightly worried, very tired
gaze to his son:
'stone lion blew off the library steps.prowling the town now looking for christians. won't find
any. got the only one no in captivity here, and she's a good cook.'
'bosh,' said mom.

jim stared at the hidden wrist and put the card in his pocket.
'so long!'
jim ran. will ran.
jim whirled, glanced back, leaped, and for the second time in the hour, vanished.
will looked up into the tree where jim squirmed on a limb, hidden.
mr dark and mr cooger were turned away, busy with the merry-go-round.
'quick, will!'
'jimâ€¦?'
'they'll see you. jump!'
will jumped. jim hauled him up. the great tree shook.a wind roared by in the sky. jim helped
him cling, gasping, among the branches.
'jim, we don't belong here!'
'shut up! look!' whispered jim.

and whistle of calliope steam.

mr dark jerked about, glanced up, as if he had heard will's thoughts.a wind shook the trees

perverse thrusts through all his flesh, so he was nearly shaken free to fall, so all he did was
clutch, hang pale, and drink the sight of the backward-turning machine and mr dark, alert at
the controls, on the sidelines.
it was jim who first noticed the new thing happening, for he kicked will, once, will looked
over, and jim nodded frantically at the man in the machine as he came around the next time.
mr cooger's face was melting like pink wax.
his hands were becoming doll's hands.
his bones sank away beneath his clothes; his clothes then shrank down to fit his dwindling
frame.
his face flickered going, and each time around he melted more.
will saw jim's head shift, circling.
the carousel wheeled, a great back-drifting lunar dream the horses thrusting, the music ingasped
after, while mr cooger, as simple as shadows, as simple as light, as simple as time, got
younger.and younger.and younger.

burning away to tender years.
he gazed serenely at the fiery constellations, the children-inhabited trees, which went away
from him as he removed himself from them and his nose finished and his sweet wax ears
reshaped themselves to small pink roses.
now no longer forty where he had begun his back-spiraled journey, mr cooger was nineteen.
around went the reverse parade of horse, pole, music, man become young man, young man
fast rendered down to boyâ€¦
mr cooger was seventeen, sixteenâ€¦
another and another time around under the sky and trees and will whispering, jim counting
the times around, around, while the night air warmed to summer heat by friction of sun-metal
brass, the passionate backturned flight of beasts, wore the wax doll down and down and
washed him clean with the still stranger musics until all ceased

calliope shut up its brassworks, the ironmongery machines hissed off, and with a last faint
whine like desert sands blown backup arabian hourglasses, the carousel rocked on seaweed
waters and stood still.
the figure seated in the carved white wooden sleigh chair was very small.
mr cooger was twelve years old.
no. will's mouth shaped the word. no. jim's did the same.
the small shape, stepped down from the silent world, its face in shadow, but its hands
newborn wrinkled pink, held out in raw carnival lamplight.
the strange man-boy shot his gaze up, down, smelling fright somewhere, terror and awe in
the vicinity. will balled himself tight and shut his eyes. he felt the terrible gaze shoot through
the leaves like brown needle-darts, pass on. then,rabbit-running, the small shape lit

up ahead the small shape stopped and looked back.
jim and will ducked in by a tree and let it move on.
'it', thought will. why do i think 'it'? he's a boy, he's a manâ€¦noâ€¦it is something that has
changed, that's what it is.
they reached and passed the city limits, and swiftly jogging, will said, jim, there must've
been two people on that ride, mr cooger and this boy and - '
'no. i never took my eyes off him!'
they ran by the barber shop. will saw but did not see a sign in the window. he read but did
not read. he remembered, he forgot. he plunged on.
'hey! he's turned on culpepper street! quick!'
they rounded a corner.
'he's gone!'
the street lay long and empty in the lamplight.
leaves blew on the hopscotch-chalked sidewalks.
'will, miss foley lives on this street.'
'sure, fourth house, but - '
jim strolled, casually whistling, hands in pockets

glanced up.
in one of the softly lit front windows, someone stood looking out.
a boy, no more and no less than twelve years old.
'will!' cried jim, softly. 'that boy - '
'her nephewâ€¦?'
'nephew, heck! keep your head away. maybe he can read lips. walk slow. to the corner and
back.you see his face? the eyes, will! that's one part of people don't change, young, old, six
or sixty! boy's face, sure, but the eyes were the eyes of mr cooger!'
'no!'
'yes!'
they both stopped to enjoy the swift pound of each other's heart.
'keep moving.' they moved. jim held will's arm tight, leading him. 'you did see mr cooger's
eyes huh? when he held us up fit to crack our heads together? you did see the boy, just off
the ride? he looked right up near me, hid in the tree, and boy! it was like opening the door of a
furnace! i'll never forget those eyes! and there they are now, in the window. turn around. now,

the front window was empty.
'going to walk up and ring the bell,' said jim.
'what, meet him face to face?!'
'my aunt's eyebrows, will we got to check, don't we? shake his paw, stare him in his good
eye or some such,and if it is him - '
'we don't warn, miss foley right in front of him, do we?'
'we'll phone her later, dumb. up we go!'
will sighed and let himself be walked up the steps wanting but not wanting to know if the
boy in this house had mr cooger hid but showing like a firefly between his eyelashes.
jim rang the bell.
'what if he answers?' will demanded. 'boy, i'm so scared i could sprinkle dust. jim, why aren't
you scared, why?'
jim examined both of his untrembled hands. i'll be darned,' he gasped. 'you're right! iâ€™m not!'
the door swung wide.
miss foley beamed out at them.

'like an uncle of mine,' said jim, all sweet and calm.
the nephew flicked his eyes to will, who looked only at the floor, afraid the boy would see his
eyeballs whirl with the remembered carousel. crazily, he wanted to hum the backward music.
now, he thought, face him!
he looked up straight at the boy.
and it was wild and crazy and the floor sank away beneath for there was the pink shiny
hallowe'en mask of a small pretty boy's face, but almost as if holes were cut where the eyes of
mr cooger shone out, old, old, eyes as bright as sharp blue stars and the light from those stars
taking a million years to get here.and through the little nostrils cut in the shiny mask, mr
cooger's breath went in steam, came out ice.and the valentine candy tongue moved small
behind those trim white candy-kernel teeth.
mr cooger, somewhere behind the eye-slits, went blink-click with his insect-kodak pupils.
the lenses exploded like suns, then burnt chilly and serene again.
he swivelled his glance to jim.

'we got to go!'
everyone looked at will as if amazed he didn't want to stick here forever.
'jim - ' he stammered. 'your mom's home alone - '
'oh, sure,' jim said,reluctantly.
'i know what.' the nephew paused for their attention. when their faces turned, mr cooger
inside the nephew went silently blink-click, blink-click, listening through the toy ears, watching
through the toy-charm eyes, whetting the doll's mouth with a pekingese tongue. 'join us later
for dessert, huh?'
'dessert?'
'i'm taking aunt willa to the carnival.' the boy stroked miss foley's arm until she laughed
nervously.

while the merry-go-round started again in will's head,rushing while the leaves in the trees
above cracked and fried with wind.aside, will spluttered, 'jim, you shook hands with him! mr
cooger! you're not going to meet him!?'
'it's mr cooger, all right.boy, those eyes. if i met him tonight, we'd solve the whole shooting
match. what's eating you, will?'
'eating me!' at the bottom of the steps now, they tussled in fierce and frantic whispers,
glancing up at the empty windows where, now and again, a shadow passed. will stopped. the
music turned in his head.stunned, he squinched his eyes. 'jim, the music that the calliope
played when mr cooger got younger - '
'yeah?'
'it was the â€˜funeral marchâ€™! played backward!'
'which â€˜funeral

'which! jim, chopin only wrote one tune! the â€˜funeral marchâ€™!'
'but why played backward?'
'mr cooger was marching away from the grave, not toward it, wasn't he, getting younger,
smaller, instead of older and dropping dead?'
'willy, you're terrific!'
'sure, but - ' will stiffened. 'he's there, the window, again. wave at him.so long! now, walk

it meant plums, peaches, or apples were ripe enough to get sick on out beyond town.
so this night will held his breath waiting for some tune to call him forth.
what kind of tune would jim play to represent the carnival, miss foley, mr cooger, and/or the
evil nephew?
ten-fifteen. ten-thirty.

will did not like jim sitting in his room thinking what? of the mirror maze? what had he seen
there? and, seeing, what did he plan?

'maybe he was! oh god.' jim turned, yelling. 'mr cooger! we brought help!'

there, on the biggest stage, a tattoo needle poised like a blowgun dart in his rose-crusted
hand, stood mr dark, the illustrated man.
his picture crowds flooded raw upon his flesh.stripped bare to the navel, he had been
stinging himself, adding a picture to his left palm with this dragonfly contraption. now with the
insect droned dead in his hand, he wheeled.but will, staring beyond him, cried:
'there he is! there's mr cooger!'
the police, the internes, quickened.
behind mr dark sat the electric chair.
in this chair sat a ruined man, last seen strewn wheezing in a collapse of bones and albino
wax on the broken carousel. now he was erected, propped, strapped in this device full of
lightning power.
'that's him! he wasâ€¦dying.'
the blimp ascended to his feet.

'no! look at the old man! look!' will yelled. the police turned to appraise his demon cry.
'don't you see!' said will. 'he's dead! only thing holds him up is the straps!'
the internes gazed up at the great flake of winter flung into and held by the black chair.
oh gosh, thought will, we thought it would all be simple. the old man, mr cooger, dying, so
we bring doctors to save him, so he forgives us, maybe, maybe, the carnival doesn't hurt us,
lets us go.but now this, what's next? he's dead! it's too late! everyone hates us!

from the cold mouth and cold eyes locked up in frozen eyelids. inside the frozen nostrils not a

no lions for them to be tossed to, only the maze where time lost itself backward and forward in

leaves, a prickling blue that teemed and sifted to earth.swarming its own shadows, the dust
filtered over the tents.
charles halloway sneezed. figures jumped and scurried away from an upended, half-tilted
object abandoned half-way between one tent and the carousel.
the object was the electric chair, capsized, with straps dangling from wooden arms and legs,
and a metal headcap hanging from its top.
â€˜but,â€™ said will. â€˜where's mr.electrico!? i mean mr. cooger!?â€™
â€˜that must have been him.â€™
â€˜what must have been him?â€™
but the answer was there, sifting down the midway in the whorling wind devilsâ€¦ the burnt
spice, the autumn incense that had floured them when they turned this comer.
kill or cure, charles halloway thought. he imagined them rushed in the last few seconds,
toting the ancient dustsack boneheap over starched grasses in his disconnected chair,

really nothing but a mortuary junkpile,rust-flakes and dying coals that no wind could blow
alight again.yet they must try. how many times in the last twenty-four hours had they run out
on such excursions, only, in panic, to cease activity because the merest jolt, the slightest
breath, threatened to shake old ancient cooger down to mealmush and chaff? better to leave
him propped in electric-warm chair, a continual exhibit, an ever-going-on performance for
gaping audiences, and try again, but especially try now, when, lights out, and crowds herded off

tall, flame-headed, and riven with earthquake violence.but somewhere, twenty seconds, ten
seconds ago, the last glue crumbled, the last bolt of life fell free, and the mummy

erector-set grotesque disencumbered itself in smoke puffs and november leaflets, a broadcast
of mortality along the wind. mr. cooger, threshed in a final harvest, was now a billion parchment
flecks, tumbled sea-scrolls capered in meadows.a mere dust explosion in a silo of ancient
grain: gone.
â€˜oh, no. no, no,, no,, no,â€™ someone murmured.
charles halloway touched will's arm.
will stopped saying â€˜oh, no, no, no.â€™ he, too, in the last few moments, had thought the same

the freak oil paintings clapped hands high on the last standing pennant poles, then
plummeted to earth.

dark. he moved away into the fields.
will, in a swift moment, saw the thin man and his burden go over a hill among all the
footprints of the vanished carnival race.
will's face shadowed this way, then that, pulled by the swift concussions, the tumults, the
deaths, the fleeing away of souls. cooger, dark,skeleton, dwarf-who-was-lightning-rodsalesman,

quiet! it's all right. come back, come back!
but the wind was blowing their footprints out of the grass and they might run forever now
trying to outflee themselves.
so will turned back astride jim and pushed the chest and let go, pushed and let go, then,
trembling, touched his dear friend's cheek.
