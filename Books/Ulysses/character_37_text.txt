vered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar
rhomboids. footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel,
heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet
without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. the walls
are tapestried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. in the grate
is spread a screen of peacock feathers. lynch squats crosslegged on
the hearthrug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. with a wand he
beats time slowly. kitty ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume,
doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in
her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and
glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. a tag
of her corsetlace hangs slightly below her jacket. lynch indicates
mockingly the couple at the piano.)

kitty: (coughs behind her hand.) she’s a bit imbecillic. (she signs with
a waggling forefinger.) blemblem. (lynch lifts up her skirt and white
petticoat

 stands at
the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. with two fingers he
repeats once more the series of empty fifths. florry talbot, a blond
feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry,
lolls spreadeagle in the sofacorner, her limp forearm pendent over the
bolster, listening. a heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)

kitty: (hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) o, excuse!

zoe: (promptly.) your boy’s thinking of you. tie a knot on your shift.

(kitty ricketts bends her head. her boa uncoils, slides, glides over
her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. lynch lifts the curled
catterpillar on his wand. she snakes her neck, nestling. stephen glances
behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)

stephen: as a matter of fact it is of no importance whether benedetto
marcello found it or made it. the rite is the poet’s rest. it may be an
old hymn to demeter or also illustrate cœla enarrant gloriam domini.
it is susceptible of nodes

from her garters up her
flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie’s green. she puffs calmly at
her cigarette.) can you see the beautyspot of my behind?

lynch: i’m not looking

zoe: (makes sheep’s eyes.) no? you wouldn’t do a less thing. would you
suck a lemon?

(squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at bloom,
then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. blue
fluid again flows over her flesh. bloom stands, smiling desirously,
twirling his thumbs. kitty ricketts licks her middle finger with her
spittle and, gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. lipoti virag,
basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts
two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. he is sausaged into several
overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of
parchment. in his left eye flashes the monocle of cashel boyle o’connor
fitzmaurice tisdall farrell. on his head is perched an egyptian pshent.
two quills project over his ears.)

and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his
pocket and offers it nervously to zoe.)

zoe: (sniffs his hair briskly.) hmmm! thank your mother for the rabbits.
i’m very fond of what i like.

bloom: (hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep,
pricks his ears.) if it were he? after? or because not? or the double
event?

zoe: (tears open the silverfoil.) fingers was made before forks. (she
breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to kitty ricketts and then
turns kittenishly to lynch.) no objection to french lozenges? (he nods.
she taunts him.) have it now or wait till you get it? (he opens his
mouth, his head cocked. she whirls the prize in left circle. his head
follows. she whirls it back in right circle. he eyes her.) catch!

(she tosses a piece. with an adroit snap he catches it and bites it
through with a crack.)

kitty: (chewing.) the engineer i was with at the bazaar does have lovely
ones. full of the best liqueurs. and the viceroy
