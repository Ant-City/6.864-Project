straightening up - guil checks again and bows again.)

 my too much changed son. go, some of you,

 (to attendants exit backwards, indicating that ros and guil should
follow.)
 guil: heaven make our presence and our practices
 pleasant and helpful to him.
 gertrude: ay, amen!
 (ros and guil move towards and downstage wing. before they get there,
polonius enters. they stop and bow to him. he nods and hurries upstage to
claudius. they turn to look at him but lose interest and come down to
footlights. polinius meanwhile calling to claudius.)
 polonius: the ambassadors from norway, my good lord, are joyfully
returned.
 claudius: thou still hast been the father of good news.
 polonius: have i, my lord? assure you, my good liege,
 i hold my duty as i hold my soul,
 both to my god and to my gracious king;
 and i do think or else this brain of mine

 ros: who?
 guil: there.
 (ros goes to an upstage wing, looks, returns, formally making his report.)
 ros: yes.
 guil: what is he doing?
 (ros repeats movement.)
 ros: talking.
 guil: to himself?
 (ros starts to move. guil cuts him impatiently.)
 is he alone?
 ros: no.
 guil: then he's not talking to himself, is he?
 ros: not by himself... coming this way, i think. (shiftily.) should we go?
 guil: why? we're marked now.
 (hamlet enters, backwards, talking, followed by polonius, upstage. ros and guil occupy the two
downstage corners looking upstage.)
 hamlet: ... for you yourself, sir, should be as old as i am if like a crab you could go backwards.
 polonius (aside): though this be madness, yet there is method in it.
will you walk out of air, my lord?
 hamlet: into my grave.
 polonius: indeed, that's out of air.
 (hamlet crosses to upstage exit, polonius asiding unintelligibly until -)
 my lord, i will take my leave of you.
 hamlet: you cannot take from me anything th

 polonius (crossing downstage): fare you well, my lord. (to ros.) you go

 ros (to polonius) god save you, sir.
 (polonius goes.)
 guil (calls upstage to hamlet): my honoured lord!
 ros: my most dear lord!
 (hamlet centred upstage, turns to them.)
 hamlet: my excellent good friends! how dost thou guildenstern? (coming downstage with am arm raised to
ros, guil meanwhile bowing to no greeting.
hamlet corrects himself. still to ros.) ah rosencrantz!
 (they laugh good naturedly at the mistake. they all meet midstage, turn upside to walk, hamlet in the middle,
arm over each shoulder.)
 hamlet: good lads, how do you both

e then. (he takes their hands.) the
appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. let me comply with you in this garb, lest my extent to the
players (which i tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like entertainment than yours. you are
welcome. (about to leave.) but my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.
 guil: in what, my dear lord?
 hamlet: i am but mad north north-west; when the wind is southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw.
 (polunius enters, as guil turns away.)
 polonius: well be you gentlemen.
 hamlet (to ros): mark you, guildenstern (uncertainly to guil) and you too; at each ear a hearer. that great
baby you see there is not yet out of swaddling clouts... (he takes ros upstage with him, talking together.)
 polonius: my lord! i have news to tell you.
 hamlet (releasing ros and mimicking): my lord, i have news to tell you... when rocius was an actor in
rome...

 guil: no.
 ros: ah.
 (pause.)
 guil: i think we can say we made some headway.
 ros: you think so?
 guil: i think we can say that.
 ros: i think we can say he made us look ridiculous.
 guil: we played it close to the chest of course.

guil. guil considers them. indicates the left hand, ros opens it to show it
empty.)
 ros: no.
 (repeat process. guil indicates left hand again. ros shows it empty.)
 double bluff!
 (repeat process - guil taps one hand, then the other hand, quickly. ros inadvertently shows that both are
empty. ros laughs as guil turns upstage. ros stops laughing, looks around his left, pats his clothes, puzzled.)
 (polonius breaks that up by entering upstage followed by the tragedians
and hamlet.)
 polonius (entering): come, sirs.
 hamlet: follow him, friends. we'll hear a play tomorrow.
 (aside to the player, who is the last of the tragedians.)
 dost thou hear me, old friend? can you play "the murder of gonzago"?
 player: ay, my lord.
 hamlet: we'll ha't tomorrow night. you could for a need study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which i
would set down and insert in't, could you not?
 player: ay, my lord.

in a circus on the indo-chinese border. (he breaks out.) they're taking us for granted! well, i won't stand for it! in
future, notice will be taken. (he wheels again to face into the wings.) keep out, then! i forbid anyone to
enter! (no one comes - breathing heavily.) that's better....
 (immediately, behind him a grand procession enters, principally
claudius, gertrude, polonius and ophelia. claudius takes ros's elbow as he passes and is
immediately deep in conversation: the context is shakespeare
act iii, scene i. guil still faces front as claudius, ros, etc., pass
upstage and turn.)
 guil: death followed by eternity ... the worst of both worlds. it is a
terrible thought.
 (he turns upstage in time to take over the conversation with claudius.
gertrude and ros head downstage.)
 gertrude: did he receive you well?
 ros: most like a gentleman.

 ros (a flat lie and he knows it and shows it, perhaps catching guil's
eye): niggard of question, but of our demands most free in his reply.
 gertrude: did you assay him to any pastime?
 ros: madam, it so fell out that certain players
 we o'erraught on the way: of these we told him
 and there did seem in him a kind of joy
 to hear of it. they are here about the court,
 and, as i think, they have already order
 this night to play before him.
 polonius: 'tis most true
 and he beseeched me to entreat your majesties
 to hear and see the matter.
 claudius: with all my heart, and it doth content me
 to hear him so inclined.
 good gentlemen, give him a further edge
 and drive his purpose into these delights.
 ros: we shall, my lord.
 claudius (leading out procession):
 sweet gertrude, leave us, too,
 for we have closely sent for hamlet hither,
 that he, as t'were by accident, may here
 affront ophelia....

upstage, he speaks into her ear a quick clipped sentence.) to a nunnery, go.

audible. a slight silence.)

 (claudius enters with polonius and goes over to ophelia and lifts her
to her feet. the tragedians jump back with heads inclined.)
 claudius: love? his affections do not that way tend,
 or what he spake, though it lacked form a little,
 was not like madness. there's something
 in his soul o'er which his melancholy sits on
 brood, and i do doubt the hatch and the
 disclose will be some danger; which for to
 prevent i have in quick determination thus set
 it down: he shall with speed to england....

 (they disport themselves to accommodate the next piece of mime, which consists of the player himself
exhibiting an excitable anguish (choreographed, stylized) leading to an impassioned scene with the queen
(cf. "the closet scene", shakespeare act iii, scene iv) and a very stylized reconstruction of a polonius figure
being stabbed behind the arras (the murdered king to stand in for polonius) while the player himself
continues his breathless commentary for the benefit of ros and guil.)
 player: lucianus, nephew to the king ... usurped by his uncle and shattered by his mother's incestuous
marriage ... loses his reason ... throwing the court into turmoil and disarray as he alternates between bitter
melancholy and unrestricted lunacy ... staggering from the suicidal (a pose) to the homicidal (here he kil

 ros and guil: you're wanted...
 (guil furiously leaps to his feet as claudius and gertrude enter. they are in some desperation.)
 claudius: friends both, go join you with some further aid: hamlet in madness hath polonius slain, and from
his mother's closet hath he dragged him. go seek him out; speak fair and bring the body into the chapel. i pray
you haste in this. (as he and gertrude are hurrying out.) come gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends and
let them know both what we mean to do...

 (he positions ros with his back to one wing, facing hamlet's entrance.)
 (guil positions himself next to ros, a few feet away, so that they are covering one side of the stage, facing the
opposite side. guil unfastens his belt. ros does the same. they join the two belts, and hold them taut between
them. ros's trousers slide slowly down.)
 (hamlet enters opposite, slowly, dragging polonius's body. he enters upstage, makes a small arc and
leaves by the same side, a few feet downstage.)
 (ros and guil, holding the belts taut, stare at him in some bewilderment.)
 (hamlet leaves, dragging the body. they relax the strain on the belts.)
 ros: that was close.
 guil: there's a limit to what two people can do.
 (they undo the belts: ros pulls up his trousers.)
