the duke and the dauphin  - 
a pair of con men whom huck and jim rescue as they
are being run out of a river town. the older man, who appears to
be about seventy, claims to be the "dauphin," the son of king louis
xvi and heir to the french throne. the younger man, who is about thirty,
claims to be the usurped duke of bridgewater. although huck quickly
realizes the men are frauds, he and jim remain at their mercy, as
huck is only a child and jim is a runaway slave. the duke and the
dauphin carry out a number of increasingly disturbing swindles as
they travel down the river on the raft.
