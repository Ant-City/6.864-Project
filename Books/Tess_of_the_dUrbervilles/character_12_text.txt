sary it has been for you to toil along on foot, and
encumber yourself with this heavy load!  i have followed like a
madman, simply to drive you the rest of the distance, if you won't
come back."

"i shan't come back," said she.

"i thought you wouldn't--i said so!  well, then, put up your basket,
and let me help you on."

she listlessly placed her basket and bundle within the dog-cart, and
stepped up, and they sat side by side.  she had no fear of him now,
and in the cause of her confidence her sorrow lay.

d'urberville mechanically lit a cigar, and the journey was continued
with broken unemotional conversation on the commonplace objects by
the wayside.  he had quite forgotten his struggle to kiss her when,
in the early summer, they had driven in the opposite direction along
the same road.  but she had not, and she sat now, like a puppet,
replying to his remarks in monosyllables.  after some miles they came
in view of the clump of trees beyond which the village of marlott
stood.  it was only

in a few verses of the ballad about the maid who went to the merry
green wood and came back a changed state.  there are counterpoises
and compensations in life; and the event which had made of her a
social warning had also for the moment made her the most interesting
personage in the village to many.  their friendliness won her still
farther away from herself, their lively spirits were contagious, and
she became almost gay.

but now that her moral sorrows were passing away a fresh one arose on
the natural side of her which knew no social law.  when she reached
home it was to learn to her grief that the baby had been suddenly
taken ill since the afternoon.  some such collapse had been probable,
so tender and puny was its frame; but the event came as a shock
nevertheless.

the baby's offence against society in coming into the world was
forgotten by the girl-mother; her soul's desire was to continue that
offence by preserving the life of the child

wonder which their physical heaviness at that hour would not allow to
become active.

the most impressed of them said:

"be you really going to christen him, tess?"

the girl-mother replied in a grave affirmative.

"what's his name going to be?"

she had not thought of that, but a name suggested by a phrase in
the book of genesis came into her head as she proceeded with the
baptismal service, and now she pronounced it:

"sorrow, i baptize thee in the name of the father, and of the son,
and of the holy ghost."

she sprinkled the water, and there was silence.

"say 'amen,' children."

the tiny voices piped in obedient response, "amen!"

tess went on:

"we receive this child"--and so forth--"and do sign him with the sign
of the cross."

here she dipped her hand into the basin, and fervently drew an
immense cross upon the baby with her forefinger, continuing with
the customary sentences as to his manfully fighting against

the ecstasy of faith almost apotheosized her; it set upon her face a
glowing irradiation, and brought a red spot into the middle of each
cheek; while the miniature candle-flame inverted in her eye-pupils
shone like a diamond.  the children gazed up at her with more and
more reverence, and no longer had a will for questioning.  she did
not look like sissy to them now, but as a being large, towering, and
awful--a divine personage with whom they had nothing in common.

poor sorrow's campaign against sin, the world, and the devil was
doomed to be of limited brilliancy--luckily perhaps for himself,
considering his beginnings.  in the blue of the morning that fragile
soldier and servant breathed his last, and when the other children
awoke they cried bitterly, and begged sissy to have another pretty
baby.

with her in the infant's loss.  in the daylight, indeed, she felt her

well founded or not, she had no uneasiness now, reasoning that
if providence would not ratify such an act of approximation
she, for one, did not value the kind of heaven lost by the
irregularity--either for herself or for her child.

so passed away sorrow the undesired--that intrusive creature, that
bastard gift of shameless nature, who respects not the social law;
a waif to whom eternal time had been a matter of days merely, who
knew not that such things as years and centuries ever were; to whom
the cottage interior was the universe, the week's weather climate,
new-born babyhood human existence, and the instinct to suck human
knowledge.

that fair sufferer soon recovered herself externally; but she
remained much depressed all the afternoon. when the evening milking
was done she did not care to be with the rest of them, and went out
of doors, wandering along she knew not whither.  she was wretched--o
so wretched--at the perception that to her companions the dairyman's
story had been rather a humorous narration than otherwise; none of
them but herself seemed to see the sorrow of it; to a certainty, not
one knew how cruelly it touched the tender place in her experience.
the evening sun was now ugly to her, like a great inflamed wound in
the sky.  only a solitary cracked-voice reed-sparrow greeted her from
the bushes by the river, in a sad, machine-made tone, resembling that
of a past friend whose friendship she had outworn.

they had heard so very little of this; yet it was enough to build up
wretched dolorous dreams upon, there in the shade of the night.  they
pictured all the details of his being won round to consent, of the
wedding preparations, of the bride's happiness, of her dress and
veil, of her blissful home with him, when oblivion would have fallen
upon themselves as far as he and their love were concerned.  thus
they talked, and ached, and wept till sleep charmed their sorrow
away.

after this disclosure tess nourished no further foolish thought that
there lurked any grave and deliberate import in clare's attentions
to her.  it was a passing summer love of her face, for love's own
temporary sake--nothing more. and the thorny crown of this sad
conception was that she whom he really did prefer in a cursory way
to the rest, she who knew herself to be more impassioned in nature,
cleverer, more beautiful than they, was in the eyes of propriety far
less worthy of him than

 quite unambitious.  they are two of the few

"i don't know."

"you go to church very regularly, and our parson here is not very
high, they tell me."

tess's ideas on the views of the parish clergyman, whom she heard
every week, seemed to be rather more vague than clare's, who had
never heard him at all.

"i wish i could fix my mind on what i hear there more firmly than i
do," she remarked as a safe generality.  "it is often a great sorrow
to me."

she spoke so unaffectedly that angel was sure in his heart that his
father could not object to her on religious grounds, even though she
did not know whether her principles were high, low or broad.  he
himself knew that, in reality, the confused beliefs which she held,
apparently imbibed in childhood, were, if anything, tractarian as to
phraseology, and pantheistic as to essence.  confused or otherwise,
to disturb them was his last desire:

s of her heart, as she walked leaning on his arm; her
contented pauses, the occasional little laugh upon which her soul
seemed to ride--the laugh of a woman in company with the man she
loves and has won from all other women--unlike anything else in
nature.  they marked the buoyancy of her tread, like the skim of a
bird which has not quite alighted.

her affection for him was now the breath and life of tess's being;
it enveloped her as a photosphere, irradiated her into forgetfulness
of her past sorrows, keeping back the gloomy spectres that would
persist in their attempts to touch her--doubt, fear, moodiness, care,
shame. she knew that they were waiting like wolves just outside the
circumscribing light, but she had long spells of power to keep them
in hungry subjection there.

a spiritual forgetfulness co-existed with an intellectual
remembrance.  she walked in brightness, but she knew that in the
background those shapes of darkness were always spread.  they might

 processes.  at two o'clock there was
nothing left to do but to start.  all the servantry of the dairy were
standing in the red-brick entry to see them go out, the dairyman and
his wife following to the door.  tess saw her three chamber-mates
in a row against the wall, pensively inclining their heads.  she
had much questioned if they would appear at the parting moment; but
there they were, stoical and staunch to the last.  she knew why the
delicate retty looked so fragile, and izz so tragically sorrowful,
and marian so blank; and she forgot her own dogging shadow for a
moment in contemplating theirs.

she impulsively whispered to him--

"will you kiss 'em all, once, poor things, for the first and last
time?"

clare had not the least objection to such a farewell formality--which
was all that it was to him--and as he passed them he kissed them in
succession where they stood, saying "goodbye" to each as he did so.
when they reached the door tess femininely glanced back to discern

instant. this was the explanation of that mysterious parcel which it
had been so difficult to pack and bring; whose contents he would not
explain to her, saying that time would soon show her the purpose
thereof.  in his zest and his gaiety he had hung it there.  how
foolish and inopportune that mistletoe looked now.

having nothing more to fear, having scarce anything to hope, for that
he would relent there seemed no promise whatever, she lay down dully.
when sorrow ceases to be speculative, sleep sees her opportunity.
among so many happier moods which forbid repose this was a mood which
welcomed it, and in a few minutes the lonely tess forgot existence,
surrounded by the aromatic stillness of the chamber that had once,
possibly, been the bride-chamber of her own ancestry.

later on that night clare also retraced his steps to the house.

the marked civility of clare's tone in calling her seemed to have
inspired her, for the moment, with a new glimmer of hope.  but it
soon died when she looked at him.

the pair were, in truth, but the ashes of their former fires.  to the
hot sorrow of the previous night had succeeded heaviness; it seemed
as if nothing could kindle either of them to fervour of sensation any
more.

he spoke gently to her, and she replied with a like
undemonstrativeness.  at last she came up to him, looking in his
sharply-defined face as one who had no consciousness that her own
formed a visible object also.

"angel!" she said, and paused, touching him with her fingers lightly
as a breeze, as though she could hardly believe to be there in the

upporting her forehead.  "it is quite true,
all of it; it must be.  you must go away from me."

"but what can you do?"

"i can go home."

clare had not thought of that.

"are you sure?" he inquired.

"quite sure.  we ought to part, and we may as well get it past and
done.  you once said that i was apt to win men against their better
judgement; and if i am constantly before your eyes i may cause you
to change your plans in opposition to your reason and wish; and
afterwards your repentance and my sorrow will be terrible."

"and you would like to go home?" he asked.

"i want to leave you, and go home."

"then it shall be so."

though she did not look up at him, she started.  there was a
difference between the proposition and the covenant, which she had
felt only too quickly.

"i feared it would come to this," she murmured, her countenance
meekly fixed.  "i don't complain, angel, i--i think it best.  what
you said has quite convinced me.  yes, though nobody else should
reproach me if we should s

 know what i was saying, either,
wh--when i agreed to go!  i wish--what cannot be!"

"because i have a loving wife already."

"yes, yes!  you have!"

they reached the corner of the lane which they had passed half an
hour earlier, and she hopped down.

"izz--please, please forget my momentary levity!" he cried.  "it was
so ill-considered, so ill-advised!"

"forget it?  never, never!  o, it was no levity to me!"

he felt how richly he deserved the reproach that the wounded cry
conveyed, and, in a sorrow that was inexpressible, leapt down and
took her hand.

"well, but, izz, we'll part friends, anyhow?  you don't know what
i've had to bear!"

she was a really generous girl, and allowed no further bitterness to
mar their adieux.

"i forgive 'ee, sir!" she said.

"now, izz," he said, while she stood beside him there, forcing
himself to the mentor's part he was far from feeling; "i want you to
tell marian when you see her that she is to be a good woman, and not
to give way to folly.  promise that,

r.  goodbye!"

he drove on; but no sooner had izz turned into the lane, and clare
was out of sight, than she flung herself down on the bank in a fit of
racking anguish; and it was with a strained unnatural face that she
entered her mother's cottage late that night.  nobody ever was told
how izz spent the dark hours that intervened between angel clare's
parting from her and her arrival home.

clare, too, after bidding the girl farewell, was wrought to aching
thoughts and quivering lips.  but his sorrow was not for izz.  that
evening he was within a feather-weight's turn of abandoning his road
to the nearest station, and driving across that elevated dorsal line
of south wessex which divided him from his tess's home.  it was
neither a contempt for her nature, nor the probable state of her
heart, which deterred him.

no; it was a sense that, despite her love, as corroborated by izz's
admission, the facts had not changed.  if he was right at first,
he was right now.  and the momentum of the cours

for her gloom of the night, based on nothing more tangible than a
sense of condemnation under an arbitrary law of society which had no

it was now broad day, and she started again, emerging cautiously upon
the highway.  but there was no need for caution; not a soul was at
hand, and tess went onward with fortitude, her recollection of the
birds' silent endurance of their night of agony impressing upon her
the relativity of sorrows and the tolerable nature of her own, if she
could once rise high enough to despise opinion.  but that she could
not do so long as it was held by clare.

she reached chalk-newton, and breakfasted at an inn, where several
young men were troublesomely complimentary to her good looks.
somehow she felt hopeful, for was it not possible that her husband
also might say these same things to her even yet?  she was bound to
take care of herself on the chance of it, and keep off these casual
lovers.  to t

f blackmoor, now lying misty and still
in the dawn.  instead of the colourless air of the uplands, the
atmosphere down there was a deep blue.  instead of the great
enclosures of a hundred acres in which she was now accustomed to
toil, there were little fields below her of less than half-a-dozen
acres, so numerous that they looked from this height like the meshes
of a net.  here the landscape was whitey-brown; down there, as in
froom valley, it was always green.  yet it was in that vale that her
sorrow had taken shape, and she did not love it as formerly.  beauty
to her, as to all who have felt, lay not in the thing, but in what
the thing symbolized.

keeping the vale on her right, she steered steadily westward; passing
above the hintocks, crossing at right-angles the high-road from
sherton-abbas to casterbridge, and skirting dogbury hill and
high-stoy, with the dell between them called "the devil's kitchen".

"ah!" she said, still sighing in pity of herself, "they didn't know
that i wore those over the roughest part of the road to save these
pretty ones he bought for me--no--they did not know it!  and they
didn't think that he chose the colour o' my pretty frock--no--how
could they?  if they had known perhaps they would not have cared,
for they don't care much for him, poor thing!"

then she grieved for the beloved man whose conventional standard of
judgement had caused her all these latter sorrows; and she went her
way without knowing that the greatest misfortune of her life was this
feminine loss of courage at the last and critical moment through her
estimating her father-in-law by his sons.  her present condition was
precisely one which would have enlisted the sympathies of old mr and
mrs clare.  their hearts went out of them at a bound towards extreme
cases, when the subtle mental troubles of the less desperate among
mankind failed to win their interest or regard.  in jumping at

till this moment she had never seen or heard from d'urberville since
her departure from trantridge.

the rencounter came at a heavy moment, one of all moments calculated
to permit its impact with the least emotional shock.  but such was
unreasoning memory that, though he stood there openly and palpably a
converted man, who was sorrowing for his past irregularities, a fear
overcame her, paralyzing her movement so that she neither retreated
nor advanced.

to think of what emanated from that countenance when she saw it last,
and to behold it now! ...  there was the same handsome unpleasantness
of mien, but now he wore neatly trimmed, old-fashioned whiskers, the
sable moustache having disappeared; and his dress was half-clerical,
a modification which had changed his expression sufficiently to

, while she remained unregenerate.  and, as in the
legend, it had resulted that her cyprian image had suddenly appeared
upon his altar, whereby the fire of the priest had been well nigh
extinguished.

she went on without turning her head.  her back seemed to be endowed
with a sensitiveness to ocular beams--even her clothing--so alive
was she to a fancied gaze which might be resting upon her from the
outside of that barn.  all the way along to this point her heart
had been heavy with an inactive sorrow; now there was a change in
the quality of its trouble.  that hunger for affection too long
withheld was for the time displaced by an almost physical sense
of an implacable past which still engirdled her.  it intensified
her consciousness of error to a practical despair; the break of
continuity between her earlier and present existence, which she had
hoped for, had not, after all, taken place.  bygones would never be
complete bygones till she was a bygone herself.

"don't go on with it!" she cried passionately, as she turned away
from him to a stile by the wayside, on which she bent herself.  "i
can't believe in such sudden things!  i feel indignant with you for
talking to me like this, when you know--when you know what harm
you've done me!  you, and those like you, take your fill of pleasure

sorrow; and then it is a fine thing, when you have had enough of
that, to think of securing your pleasure in heaven by becoming
converted!  out upon such--i don't believe in you--i hate it!"

"tess," he insisted; "don't speak so!  it came to me like a jolly new
idea!  and you don't believe me?  what don't you believe?"

"your conversion.  your scheme of religion."

"why?"

she dropped her voice.  "because a better man than you does not
believe in such."

englishman, bent on the same errand, though he came from another part
of the island.  they were both in a state of mental depression, and
they spoke of home affairs.  confidence begat confidence.  with that
curious tendency evinced by men, more especially when in distant
lands, to entrust to strangers details of their lives which they
would on no account mention to friends, angel admitted to this man
as they rode along the sorrowful facts of his marriage.

the stranger had sojourned in many more lands and among many more
peoples than angel; to his cosmopolitan mind such deviations from the
social norm, so immense to domesticity, were no more than are the
irregularities of vale and mountain-chain to the whole terrestrial
curve.  he viewed the matter in quite a different light from angel;
thought that what tess had been was of no importance beside what she
would be, and plainly told clare that he was wrong in coming away

where the candles were lighted she looked at his face.

"o, it is not angel--not my son--the angel who went away!" she cried
in all the irony of sorrow, as she turned herself aside.

whole story of how he had walked in his sleep
with her in his arms across the froom stream, at the imminent risk of
both their lives, and laid her down in the stone coffin at the ruined

"why didn't you tell me next day?" he said.  "it might have prevented
much misunderstanding and woe."

"don't think of what's past!" said she.  "i am not going to think
outside of now.  why should we!  who knows what to-morrow has in

but it apparently had no sorrow.  the morning was wet and foggy, and
clare, rightly informed that the caretaker only opened the windows
on fine days, ventured to creep out of their chamber and explore the
house, leaving tess asleep.  there was no food on the premises, but
there was water, and he took advantage of the fog to emerge from the
mansion and fetch tea, bread, and butter from a shop in a little
place two miles beyond, as also a small tin kettle and spirit-lamp,
that they might get fire without smoke.  his re-entry aw
