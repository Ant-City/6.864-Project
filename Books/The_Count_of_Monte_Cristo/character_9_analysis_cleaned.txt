[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER] exemplifies human dissatisfaction, helping
to illustrate that happiness depends more on attitude than on external
circumstances. though fate--or, more precisely, dantes--treats [CHARACTER]
fairly well, he is never truly satisfied with his life. no matter how
much he has, [CHARACTER] always feels that he deserves more. with
each improvement in his position, [CHARACTER]'s desires only increase.
he is pained by the good fortune of his friends, and his
envy festers into hatred and ultimately into crime. not only covetous
but also lazy and dishonest, [CHARACTER] consistently resorts to
dishonorable means in order to acquire what he wants, thieving and
even murdering in order to better his own position. ultimately,
[CHARACTER]'s unending greed catches up with him, and he dies while
trying to rob monte cristo.
