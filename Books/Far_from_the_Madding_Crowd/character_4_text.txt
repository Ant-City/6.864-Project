half-way down his throat.
  "what a night of horrors!" murmured joseph poor-
grass, waving his hands spasmodically. "i've had the
news-bell ringing in my left ear quite bad enough for a
murder, and i've seen a magpie all alone!"
  "fanny robin -- miss everdene's youngest servant --
can't be found. they've been wanting to lock up the
door these two hours, but she isn't come in. and they
don't know what to do about going to hed for fear of
locking her out. they wouldn't be so concerned if she
hadn't been noticed in such low spirits these last few
days, and maryann d'think the beginning of a crowner's

across the river before tonight.
"is it sergeant troy?" said the blurred spot in the
snow, tremulously.
this person was so much like a mere shade upon
the earth, and the other speaker so much a part of
the building, that one would have said the wall was
holding a conversation with the snow.
"yes." came suspiciously from the shadow." what
girl are you?"
"o, frank -- don't you know me?" said the spot.
"your wife, fanny robin."
"fanny!" said the wall, in utter astonishment.
"yes." said the girl, with a half-suppressed gasp of
emotion.
there was something in the woman's tone which is
not that of the wife, and there was a mannerin the man
which is rarely a husband's. the dialogue went on:
"how did you come here?"
"i asked which was your window. forgive me!"
"i did not expect you to-night. indeed, i did not
think you would come at all. it was a wonder you
found me here. i am orderly to-morrow."

"have you read it, mr. boldwood?" said gabriel;
"if not, you had better do so. i know you are interested

boldwood read the letter and looked grieved.

never come. i see she gives no address."

troy heard the dull determination in boldwood's
voice, looked at his stalwart frame, then at the thick
cudgel he carried in his hand. he remembered it was
past ten o'clock. it seemed worth while to be civil to
boldwood.
"very well, i'll listen with pleasure." said troy,
placing his bag on the ground, "only speak low, for
somebody or other may overhear us in the farmhouse
there."
"well then -- i know a good deal concerning your
fanny robin's attachment to you. i may say, too, that
i believe i am the only person in the village, excepting
gabriel oak, who does know it. you ought to marry
her."
"i suppose i ought. indeed, l wish to, but i
cannot."
"why?"
troy was about to utter something hastily; he then
checked himself and said, "i am too poor." his voice
was changed. previously it had had a devil-may-care
tone. it was the voice of a trickster now.
boldwood's present mood was not critical enough to
notice tones. he cont

and then all three parted, joseph immediately coming
up the hill with his barrow.
bathsheba, who had seen this pantomime with some
surprise, experienced great relief when boldwood turned
back again. "well, what's the message, joseph?" she
said.
he set down his barrow, and, putting upon himself
the refined aspect that a conversation with a lady re-
quired, spoke to bathsheba over the gate.
"you'll never see fanny robin no more -- use nor

"why?"
"because she's dead in the union."
"fanny dead -- never!"

to think it was from general weakness of constitution.

"never mind; go on and do what i told you. stop
 -- well no, go on."
she turned herself away from him, that he might no
longer notice the mood which had set its sign so visibly
upon her, and went indoors with a distressing sense of
faintness and a beating brow. about an hour after, she
heard the noise of the waggon and went out, still with a
painful consciousness of

the journey, made no reply, but, closing the door again
upon them, went across to where the vehicle stood, now
getting indistinct in the fog and gloom of this mildewy
time. he pulled the horse's head from the large patch
of turf it had eaten bare, readjusted the boughs over
the coffin, and drove along through the unwholesome
night.
it had gradually become rumoured in the village
that the body to be brought and buried that day was
all that was left of the unfortunate fanny robin who
had followed the eleventh from casterbridge through
melchester and onwards. but, thanks to boldwood's
reticence and oak's generosity, the lover she had followed
had never been individualized as troy. gabriel hoped
that the whole truth of the matter might not be published
till at any rate the girl had been in her grave for a few
days, when the interposing barriers of earth and time,
and a sense that the events had been somewhat shut
into oblivion, would deaden the sting that revelat

which the interposition of many lapsing years might but
indifferently lighten, and which nothing at all might
altogether remove.
suddenly, as in a last attempt to save bathsheba
from, at any rate, immediate anguish, he looked again,
as he had looked before, at the chalk writing upon the
coffinlid. the scrawl was this simple one, " fanny
robin and child." gabriel took his handkerchief and
carefully rubbed out the two latter words, leaving visible
the inscription "fanny robin" only. he then left the
room, and went out quietly by the front door.

"do you want me any longer ma'am? " inquired liddy,
at a later hour the same evening, standing by the door
with a chamber candlestick in her hand and addressing
bathsheba, who sat cheerless and alone in the large
parlour beside the first fire of the season.
"no more to-night, liddy."
"i'll sit up for master if you like, ma'am. i am not
at all afraid of fanny, if i may

or we should surely have been told more about it if it
had been true -- don't you think so, ma'am?"
"we might or we might not."
bathsheba turned and looked into the fire, that
liddy might not see her face. finding that her mistress
was going to say no more, liddy glided out, closed the
door softly, and went to bed.
bathsheba's face, as she continued looking into the
fire that evening, might have excited solicitousness on
her account even among those who loved her least.
the sadness of fanny robin's fate did not make bath-
sheba's glorious, although she was the esther to this
poor vashti, and their fates might be supposed to stand
in some respects as contrasts to each other. when
liddy came into the room a second time the beautiful
eyes which met hers had worn a listless, weary look-
when she went out after telling the story they had ex-
pressed wretchedness in full activity. her simple
country nature, fed on old-fashioned principles, was
troubled by that which would have troubl

sadness. bathsheba was regarding him from the other
side, still with parted lips and distracted eyes. capacity
for intense feeling is proportionate to the general
intensity of the nature ,and perhaps in all fanny's
sufferings, much greater relatively to her strength, there
never was a time she suffered in an absolute sense
what bathsheba suffered now.
what troy did was to sink upon  his knees with
an indefinable union of remorse and reverence upon
his face, and, bending over fanny robin, gently kissed
her, as one would kiss an infant asleep to avoid
awakening it.
at the sight and sound of that, to her, unendurable
act, bathsheba sprang towards him. all the strong
feelings which had been scattered over her existence
since she knew what feeling was, seemed gathered
together into one pulsation now. the revulsion from
her indignant mood a little earlier, when she had
meditated upon compromised honour, forestalment,
eclipse in maternity by another, was violent and entire.

striking out a new line of conduct -- not more in our-
selves, it seems, than in circumscribing events, which
appear as if leagued together to allow no novelties in
the way of amelioration.
twenty pounds having been secured from bathsheba,
he had managed to add to the sum every farthing he
could muster on his own account, which had been seven
pounds ten. with this money, twenty-seven pounds ten
in all, he had hastily driven from the gate that morning
to keep his appointment with fanny robin.
on reaching casterbridge he left the horse and trap
at an inn, and at five minutes before ten came back to
the bridge at the lower end of the town, and sat himself
upon the parapet. the clocks struck the hour, and no
fanny appeared. in fact, at that moment she was being
robed in her grave-clothes by two attendants at the
union poorhouse -- the first and last tiring-women the
gentle creature had ever been honoured with. the

creased in power, gradually spouting further and yet
further from the side of the tower. when the rain fell
in a steady and ceaseless torrent the stream dashed
downward in volumes.
we follow its course to the ground at this point of
time. the end of the liquid parabola has come forward
from the wall, has advanced over the plinth mouldings,
over a heap of stones, over the marble border, into the
midst of fanny robin's grave.
the force of the stream had, until very lately, been
received upon some loose stones spread thereabout,
which had acted as a shield to the soil under the onset.
these during the summer had been cleared from the
ground, and there was now nothing to resist the down-
fall but the bare earth. for several years the stream
had not spouted so far from the tower as it was doing
on this night, and such a contingency had been over-
looked. sometimes this obscure corner received no

side of the scene stood gabriel.
his eyes, too, were fixed on the tomb, and her arrival
having been noiseless, she had not as yet attracted his
attention. bathsheba did not at once perceive that the
grand tomb and the disturbed grave were fanny's, and
she looked on both sides and around for some humbler
mound, earthed up and clodded in the usual way. then
her eye followed oak's, and she read the words with
which the inscription opened:  --

oak saw her, and his first act was to gaze inquiringly
and learn how she received this knowledge of the
authorship of the work, which to himself had caused
considerable astonishment. but such discoveries did
not much affect her now. emotional convulsions seemed
to have become the commonplaces of her history, and
she bade him good morning, and asked him to fill in
the hole with the spade which was standing by. whilst
oak was doing as she desired, bathsheba collected the
flowers, and

gown, till it appeared preternatural. when she
reached a little shop at the other end of the place,
which stood nearly opposite to the churchyard, bath-
sheba heard singing inside the church, and she knew
that the singers were practising. she crossed the road,
opened the gate, and entered the graveyard, the high
sills of the church windows effectually screening her
from the eyes of those gathered within. her stealthy
walk was to the nook wherein troy had worked at
planting flowers upon fanny robin's grave, and she
came to the marble tombstone.
a motion of satisfaction enlivened her face as she
read the complete inscription. first came the words of
troy himself: --
erected by francis troy
in beloved memory of
fanny robin,
who died october 9, 18 -- ,
aged 20 years.
underneath this was now inscribed in new letters: --
