mr dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a
mute curse at the sky.

—it’s as uncertain as a child’s bottom, he said.

—we’re off again.

the carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed
gently. martin cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.

—tom kernan was immense last night, he said. and paddy leonard taking
him off to his face.

—o, draw him out, martin, mr power said eagerly. wait till you hear him,
simon, on ben dollard’s singing of the croppy boy.

—immense, martin cunningham said pompously. his singing of that simple
ballad, martin, is the most trenchant rendering i ever heard in the
whole course of my experience.

—trenchant, mr power said laughing. he’s dead nuts on that. and the
retrospective arrangement.

—did you read dan dawson’s speech? martin cunningham asked.

—i did not then, mr dedalus said. where is it?

—in the paper this morning.

mr bloom took the paper from his inside pocket.

brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.

—what’s the best news? mr dedalus said.

—why then not much, father cowley said. i’m barricaded up, simon, with
two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.

—jolly, mr dedalus said. who is it?

—o, father cowley said. a certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.

—with a broken back, is it? mr dedalus asked.

—the same, simon, father cowley answered. reuben of that ilk. i’m just
waiting for ben dollard. he’s going to say a word to long john to get
him to take those two men off. all i want is a little time.

he looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in
his neck.

—i know, mr dedalus said, nodding. poor old bockedy ben! he’s always
doing a good turn for someone. hold hard!

he put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.

them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.

as he came near mr dedalus greeted:

—hold that fellow with the bad trousers.

—hold him now, ben dollard said.

mr dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of ben
dollard’s figure. then, turning to father cowley with a nod, he muttered
sneeringly:

—that’s a pretty garment, isn’t it, for a summer’s day?

—why, god eternally curse your soul, ben dollard growled furiously, i
threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.

he stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes
from points of which mr dedalus flicked fluff, saying:

—they were made for a

—and how is that basso profondo, benjamin? father cowley asked.

cashel boyle o’connor fitzmaurice tisdall farrell, murmuring,
glassyeyed, strode past the kildare street club.

ben dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter’s mouth, gave forth a
deep note.

—aw! he said.

—that’s the style, mr dedalus said, nodding to its drone.

—what about that? ben dollard said. not too dusty? what?

he turned to both.

—that’ll do, father cowley said, nodding also.

the reverend hugh c. love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint
mary’s abbey past james and charles kennedy’s, rectifiers, attended by
geraldines tall and personable, towards the tholsel beyond the ford of
hurdles.

ben dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward,
his joyful fingers in the air.

ben dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button
of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the
heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.

—what few days? he boomed. hasn’t your landlord distrained for rent?

—he has, father cowley said.

—then our friend’s writ is not worth the paper it’s printed on, ben
dollard said. the landlord has the prior claim. i gave him all the
particulars. 29 windsor avenue. love is the name?

threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.

instant from father cowley’s woe. he won’t give you any trouble, bob.
