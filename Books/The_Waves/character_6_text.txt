 the sun sharpened the walls of the house, and rested like the tip of a fan upon a white blind and made a blue finger-print of shadow under the leaf by the bedroom window. the blind stirred slightly, but all within was dim and unsubstantial. the birds sang their blank melody outside.







'i see a ring,' said bernard, 'hanging above me. it quivers and hangs in a loop of light.'

'i see a slab of pale yellow,' said susan, 'spreading away until it meets a purple stripe.'

'i hear a sound,' said rhoda, 'cheep, chirp; cheep chirp; going up and down.'

'i see a globe,' said neville, 'hanging down in a drop against the enormous flanks of some hill.'

'i see a crimson tassel,' said jinny, 'twisted with gold threads.'

'i hear something stamping,' said louis. 'a great beast's foot is chained. it stamps, and stamps, and stamps.'

'look at the spider's web on the corner of the balcony,' said bernard. 'it has beads of water on it, drops of white light.'

'islands of light are swimming on the grass,' said rhoda. 'they have fallen through the trees.'

'the birds' eyes are bright in the tunnels between the leaves,' said neville.

'the stalks are covered with harsh, short hairs,' said jinny, 'and drops of water have stuck to them.'

'a caterpillar is curled in a green ring,' said susan, 'notched with blunt feet.'

'the grey-shelled snail draws across the path and flattens the blades behind him,' said rhoda.

'and burning lights from the window-panes flash in and out on the grasses,' said louis.

'now the cock crows like a spurt of hard, red water in the white tide,' said bernard.

'birds are singing up and down and in and out all round us,' said susan.

'the beast stamps; the elephant with its foot chained; the great brute on the beach stamps,' said louis.

'look at the house,' said jinny, 'with all its windows white with blinds.'

'cold water begins to run from the scullery tap,' said rhoda, 'over the mackerel in the bowl.'

'the walls are cracked with gold cracks,' said bernard, 'and there are blue, finger-shaped shadows of leaves beneath the windows.'

'now mrs constable pulls up her thick black stockings,' said susan.

'when the smoke rises, sleep curls off the roof like a mist,' said louis.

'the dining-room window is dark blue now,' said bernard, 'and the air ripples above the chimneys.'

'a swallow is perched on the lightning-conductor,' said susan. 'and biddy has smacked down the bucket on the kitchen flags.'

'that is the first stroke of the church bell,' said louis. 'then the others follow; one, two; one, two; one, two.'

'look at the table-cloth, flying white along the table,' said rhoda. 'now there are rounds of white china, and silver streaks beside each plate.'

'suddenly a bee booms in my ear,' said neville. 'it is here; it is past.'

'now let us be quick. now let me be the first to pull off these coarse clothes. here are my clean white stockings. here are my new shoes. i bind my hair with a white ribbon, so that when i leap across the court the ribbon will stream out in a flash, yet curl round my neck, perfectly in its place. not a hair shall be untidy.'

'when miss lambert passes,' said rhoda, 'talking to the clergyman, the others laugh and imitate her hunch behind her back; yet everything changes and becomes luminous. jinny leaps higher too when miss lambert passes. suppose she saw that daisy, it would change. wherever she goes, things are changed under her eyes; and yet when she has gone is not the thing the same again? miss lambert is taking the clergyman through the wicket-gate to her private garden; and when she comes to the pond, she sees a frog on a leaf, and that will change

'strangers keep on coming, people we shall never see again, people who brush us disagreeably with their familiarity, their indifference, and the sense of a world continuing without us. we cannot sink down, we cannot forget our faces. even i who have no face, who make no difference when i come in (susan and jinny change bodies and faces), flutter unattached, without anchorage anywhere, unconsolidated, incapable of composing any blankness or continuity or wall against which these bodies move. it

'the boot-boy made love to the scullery-maid in the kitchen garden,' said susan, 'among the blown-out washing.'

'the breath of the wind was like a tiger panting,' said rhoda.

'the man lay livid with his throat cut in the gutter,' said neville. 'and going upstairs i could not raise my foot against the immitigable apple tree with its silver leaves held stiff.'

the leaf danced in the hedge without anyone to blow it,' said jinny.

'bells rang punctually,' said susan, 'maids scuffled and giggled. there was a drawing in of chairs and a drawing out of chairs on the linoleum. but from one attic there was a blue view, a distant view of a field unstained by the corruption of this regimented, unreal existence.'

'down from our heads veils fell,' said rhoda. 'we clasped the flowers with their green leaves rustling in garlands.'

'we changed, we became unrecognizable,' said louis. 'exposed to all these different lights, what we had in us (for we are all so different) came intermittently, in violent patches, spaced by blank voids, to the surface as if some acid had dropped unequally on the plate. i was this, neville that, rhoda different again, and bernard too.'

'i, however,' said louis, 'losing sight of you, sat in my office and tore the date from the calendar, and announced to the world of ship-brokers, corn-chandlers and actuaries that friday the tenth, or tuesday the eighteenth, had dawned on the city of london.'

'then,' said jinny, 'rhoda and i, exposed in bright dresses, with a few precious stones nestling on a cold ring round our throats, bowed, shook hands and took a sandwich from a plate with a smile.'

'the tiger leapt, and the swallow dipped her wings in dark pools on the other side of the world,' said rhoda.

'if i could believe,' said rhoda, 'that i should grow old in pursuit and change, i should be rid of my fear: nothing persists. one moment does not lead to another. the door opens and the tiger leaps. you did not see me come. i circled round the chairs to avoid the horror of the spring. i am afraid of you all. i am afraid of the shock of sensation that leaps upon me, because i cannot deal with it as you do--i cannot make one moment merge in the next. to me they are all violent, all separate; and if i fall under the shock of the

'unknown, with or without a secret, it does not matter,' said rhoda, 'he is like a stone fallen into a pond round which minnows swarm. like minnows, we who had been shooting this way, that way, all shot round him when he came. like minnows, conscious of the presence of a great stone, we undulate and eddy contentedly. comfort steals over us. gold runs in our blood. one, two; one, two; the heart beats in serenity, in confidence, in some trance of well-being, in some rapture of benignity; and look--the outermost parts of the earth--pale shadows on the utmost horiz

('look, rhoda,' said louis, 'they have become nocturnal, rapt. their eyes are like moths' wings moving so quickly that they do not seem to move at all.'

'the flames of the festival rise high,' said rhoda.

'let us hold it for one moment,' said jinny; 'love, hatred, by whatever name we call it, this globe whose walls are made of percival, of youth and beauty, and something so deep sunk within us that we shall perhaps never make this moment out of one man again.'

'forests and far countries on the other side of the world,' said rhoda, 'are in it; seas and jungles; the howlings of jackals and moonlight falling upon some high peak where the eagle soars.'

'happiness is in it,' said neville, 'and the quiet of ordinary things. a table, a chair, a book with a paper-knife stuck between the pages. and the petal falling from the rose, and the light flickering as we sit silent, or, perhaps, bethinking us of some trifle, suddenly speak.'

'there is the puddle,' said rhoda, 'and i cannot cross it. i hear the rush of the great grindstone within an inch of my head. its wind roars in my face. all palpable forms of life have failed me. unless i can stretch and touch something hard, i shall be blown down the eternal corridors for ever. what, then, can i touch? what brick, what stone? and so draw myself across the enormous gulf into my body safely?

there at the door by the inn, our meeting-place, they are already standing--susan, louis, rhoda, jinny and neville. they have come together already. in a moment, when i have joined them, another arrangement will form, another pattern. what now runs to waste, forming scenes profusely, will be checked, stated. i am reluctant to suffer that compulsion. already at fifty yards distance i feel the order of my being changed. the tug of the magnet of their society tells upon me. i come nearer. they do not see me. now rhoda sees me, but she pretends, with her horror of the shock of meeting, that i

'now sitting side by side,' said neville, 'at this narrow table, now before the first emotion is worn smooth, what do we feel? honestly now, openly and directly as befits old friends meeting with difficulty, what do we feel on meeting? sorrow. the door will not open; he will not come. and we are laden. being now all of us middle-aged, loads are on us. let us put down our loads. what have you made of life, we ask, and i? you, bernard; you, susan; you, jinny; and rhoda and louis? the lists have been posted on the doors. before we break these rolls, and help ourselves to fish and salad, i feel in my private pocket and find my credentials--what i carry to prove my superiority. i have passed. i have papers in my private pocket that prove it. but your eyes, susan, full of turnips and cornfields, disturb me. these papers in my private pocket--the clamour that proves that i have passed--make a faint sound like that of a man clapping in an empty field to scare away

'the gold has faded between the trees,' said rhoda, 'and a slice of green lies behind them, elongated like the blade of a knife seen in dreams, or some tapering island on which nobody sets foot. now the cars begin to wink and flicker, coming down the avenue. lovers can draw into the darkness now; the boles of the trees are swollen, are obscene with lovers.'

'as if the miracle had happened,' said jinny, 'and life were

('yet, louis,' said rhoda, 'how short a time silence lasts. already they are beginning to smooth their napkins by the side of their plates. "who comes?" says jinny; and neville sighs, remembering that percival comes no more. jinny has taken out her looking-glass. surveying her face like an artist, she draws a powder-puff down her nose, and after one moment of deliberation has given precisely that red to the lips that the lips need. susan, who feels scorn and fear at the sight of these preparations, fastens the top butto

"it is time," they keep saying. "the gardens will be shut." and going with them, rhoda, swept into their current, we shall perhaps drop a little behind.'

'like conspirators who have something to whisper,' said rhoda.)

'it is true, and i know for a fact,' said bernard, 'as we walk down this avenue, that a king, riding, fell over a molehill here. but how strange it seems to set against the whirling abysses of infinite space a little figure with a golden teapot on his head. soon one recovers belief in figures: but not at once in what they put on their heads. our english past--one

'i grasp, i hold fast,' said susan. 'i hold firmly to this hand, anyone's, with love, with hatred; it does not matter which.'

'the still mood, the disembodied mood is on us,' said rhoda, 'and we enjoy this momentary alleviation (it is not often that one has no anxiety) when the walls of the mind become transparent. wren's palace, like the quartet played to the dry and stranded people in the stalls, makes an oblong. a square is stood upon the oblong and we say, "this is our dwelling-place. the structure is now visible. very little is left outside."'

'they slink away over the grass furtively, yet with assurance as if they asked of our pity their ancient privilege--not to be disturbed. the tide in the soul, tipped, flows that way; they cannot help deserting us. the dark has closed over their bodies. what song do we hear--the owl's, the nightingale's, the wren's? the steamer hoots; the light on the electric rails flashes; the trees gravely bow and bend. the flare hangs over london. here is an old woman, quietly returning, and a man, a late f

'a bird flies homeward,' said louis. 'evening opens her eyes and gives one quick glance among the bushes before she sleeps. how shall we put it together, the confused and composite message that they send back to us, and not they only, but many dead, boys and girls, grown men and women, who have wandered here, under one king or another?'

'a weight has dropped into the night,' said rhoda, 'dragging it down. every tree is big with a shadow that is not the shadow of the tree behind it. we hear a drumming on the roofs of a fasting city when the turks are hungry and uncertain tempered. we hear them crying with sharp, stag-like barks, "open, open." listen to the trams squealing and to the flashes from the electric rails. we hear the beech trees and the birch trees raise their branches as if the bride had let her silken nightdress fall and come to the doorway saying "open, open".'

'i cannot hear death anywhere tonight. stupidity, on that man's face, age, on that woman's, would be strong enough, one would think, to resist the incantation, and bring in death. but where is death tonight? all the crudity, odds and ends, this and that, have been crushed like glass splinters into the blue, the red-fringed tide, which, drawing into the shore, fertile with innumerable fish, breaks at our feet.'

'if we could mount together, if we could perceive from a sufficient height,' said rhoda, 'if we could remain untouched without any support--but you, disturbed by faint clapping sounds of praise and laughter, and i, resenting compromise and right and wrong on human lips, trust only in solitude and the violence of death and thus are divided.'

'for ever,' said louis, 'divided. we have sacrificed the embrace among the ferns, and love, love, love by the lake, standing, like conspirators who have drawn apart to share some secret, by the urn. but now look, as we stand here, a ripple bre

'now,' said rhoda, 'as they pass that tree, they regain their natural size. they are only men, only women. wonder and awe change as they put off the draperies of the flowing tide. pity returns, as they emerge into the moonlight, like the relics of an army, our representatives, going every night (here or in greece) to battle, and coming back every night with their wounds, their ravaged faces. now light falls on them again. they have faces. they become susan and bernard, jinny and neville, people we know. now what

he garden and the canopy of the currant leaves which seemed to enclose everything; flowers, burning like sparks upon the depths of green; a rat wreathing with maggots under a rhubarb leaf; the fly going buzz, buzz, buzz upon the nursery ceiling, and plates upon plates of innocent bread and butter. all these things happen in one second and last for ever. faces loom. dashing round the corner. "hullo," one says, "there's jinny. that's neville. that's louis in grey flannel with a snake belt. that's rhoda." she had a basin in which she sailed petals of white flowers. it was susan who cried, that day when i was in the tool-house with neville; and i felt my indifference melt. neville did not melt. "therefore," i said, "i am myself, not neville", a wonderful discovery. susan cried and i followed her. her wet pocket-handkerchief, and the sight of her little back heaving up and down like a pump-handle, sobbing for what was denied her, screwed my nerves up. "that is not to be borne," i said, as i sat

 these sights.

'but we were all different. the wax--the virginal wax that coats the spine melted in different patches for each of us. the growl of the boot-boy making love to the tweeny among the gooseberry bushes; the clothes blown out hard on the line; the dead man in the gutter; the apple tree, stark in the moonlight; the rat swarming with maggots; the lustre dripping blue--our white wax was streaked and stained by each of these differently. louis was disgusted by the nature of human flesh; rhoda by our cruelty; susan could not share; neville wanted order; jinny love; and so on. we suffered terribly as we became separate bodies.

'yet i was preserved from these excesses and have survived many of my friends, am a little stout, grey, rubbed on the thorax as it were, because it is the panorama of life, seen not from the roof, but from the third-storey window, that delights me, not what one woman says to one man, even if that man is myself. how could i be bullied at school therefore? how co

waste of waters. nothing would happen to lift that weight of intolerable boredom. the terms went on. we grew; we changed; for, of course, we are animals. we are not always aware by any means; we breathe, eat, sleep automatically. we exist not only separately but in undifferentiated blobs of matter. with one scoop a whole brakeful of boys is swept up and goes cricketing, footballing. an army marches across europe. we assemble in parks and halls and sedulously oppose any renegade (neville, louis, rhoda) who sets up a separate existence. and i am so made that, while i hear one or two distinct melodies, such as louis sings, or neville, i am also drawn irresistibly to the sound of the chorus chanting its old, chanting its almost wordless, almost senseless song that comes across courts at night; which we hear now booming round us as cars and omnibuses take people to theatres. (listen; the cars rush past this restaurant; now and then, down the river, a siren hoots, as a steamer makes for the sea.)

ng, twinkling; not yet formed into one whole; and a bird sings close to the window. i heard those songs. i followed those phantoms. i saw joans, dorothys, miriams, i forget their names, passing down avenues, stopping on the crest of bridges to look down into the river. and from among them rise one or two distinct figures, birds who sang with the rapt egotism of youth by the window; broke their snails on stones, dipped their beaks in sticky, viscous matter; hard, avid, remorseless; jinny, susan, rhoda. they had been educated on the east coast or on the south coast. they had grown long pigtails and acquired the look of startled foals, which is the mark of adolescence.

'jinny was the first to come sidling up to the gate to eat sugar. she nipped it off the palms of one's hands very cleverly, but her ears were laid back as if she might bite. rhoda was wild--rhoda one never could catch. she was both frightened and clumsy. it was susan who first became wholly woman, purely feminine. it was she wh

he reason why, as we flow and change, it seems to measure. neville, for example, sat with me on the turf. but can anything be as clear as all that, i would say, following his gaze, through the branches, to a punt on the river, and a young man eating bananas from a paper bag? the scene was cut out with such intensity and so permeated with the quality of his vision that for a moment i could see it too; the punt, the bananas, the young man, through the branches of the willow tree. then it faded.

'rhoda came wandering vaguely. she would take advantage of any scholar in a blowing gown, or donkey rolling the turf with slippered feet to hide behind. what fear wavered and hid itself and blew to a flame in the depths of her grey, her startled, her dreaming eyes? cruel and vindictive as we are, we are not bad to that extent. we have our fundamental goodness surely or to talk as i talk freely to someone i hardly know would be impossible--we should cease. the willow as she saw it grew on the verge of

ilmed, not with pride, but with humility rather, i walked down the street. the first whirr of wings had gone up, the carol, the exclamation; and now one enters; one goes into the house, the dry, uncompromising, inhabited house, the place with all its traditions, its objects, its accumulations of rubbish, and treasures displayed upon tables. i visited the family tailor, who remembered my uncle. people turned up in great quantities, not cut out, like the first faces (neville, louis, jinny, susan, rhoda), but confused, featureless, or changed their features so fast that they seemed to have none. and blushing yet scornful, in the oddest condition of raw rapture and scepticism, i took the blow; the mixed sensations; the complex and disturbing and utterly unprepared for impacts of life all over, in all places, at the same time. how upsetting! how humiliating never to be sure what to say next, and those painful silences, glaring as dry deserts, with every pebble apparent; and then to say what one

'was there no sword, nothing with which to batter down these walls, this protection, this begetting of children and living behind curtains, and becoming daily more involved and committed, with books and pictures? better burn one's life out like louis, desiring perfection; or like rhoda leave us, flying past us to the desert; or choose one out of millions and one only like neville; better be like susan and love and hate the heat of the sun or the frost-bitten grass; or be like jinny, honest, an animal. all had their rapture; their common feeling with death; something that stood them in stead. thus i visited each of my friends in turn, trying, with fumbling fingers, to prise open their locked caskets. i went from one to the other holding my sorrow--no, not my sorrow but the inc

 of that old pain! the desire for someone not there. for whom? i did not know at first; then remembered percival. i had not thought of him for months. now to laugh with him, to laugh with him at neville--that was what i wanted, to walk off arm-in-arm together laughing. but he was not there. the place was empty.

'it is strange how the dead leap out on us at street corners, or in dreams.

'this fitful gust blowing so sharp and cold upon me sent me that night across london to visit other friends, rhoda and louis, desiring company, certainty, contact. i wondered, as i mounted the stairs, what was their relationship? what did they say alone? i figured her awkward with the tea-kettle. she gazed over the slate roofs--the nymph of the fountain always wet, obsessed with visions, dreaming. she parted the curtain to look at the night. "away!" she said. "the moor is dark beneath the moon." i rang; i waited. louis perhaps poured out milk in a saucer for the cat; louis, whose bony hands shut like the si

the squeak of trams mixed with her cry of delight and the rippling of leaves had to shade her languor, her delicious lassitude as she sank down cooled by all the sweetness of nature satisfied. our friends, how seldom visited, how little known--it is true; and yet, when i meet an unknown person, and try to break off, here at this table, what i call "my life", it is not one life that i look back upon; i am not one person; i am many people; i do not altogether know who i am--jinny, susan, neville, rhoda, or louis; or how to distinguish my life from theirs.

'so i thought that night in early autumn when we came together and dined once more at hampton court. our discomfort was at first considerable, for each by that time was committed to a statement, and the other person coming along the road to the meeting-place dressed like this or that, with a stick or without, seemed to contradict it. i saw jinny look at susan's earthy fingers and then hide her own; i, considering neville, so neat and exact,

 felt the nebulosity of my own life blurred with all these phrases. he then boasted, because he was ashamed of one room and one person and his own success. louis and rhoda, the conspirators, the spies at table, who take notes, felt, "after all, bernard can make the waiter fetch us rolls--a contact denied us." we saw for a moment laid out among us the body of the complete human being whom we have failed to be, but at the same time, cannot forget. all that we might have been we saw; all that we had missed, and we grudged for a moment the other's claim, as children when the cake is cut, the one cake, the only cake, watch their slice diminishing.

ed by my own pugnacity. i strike the table with a spoon. if i could measure things with compasses i would, but since my only measure is a phrase, i make phrases--i forget what, on this occasion. we became six people at a table in hampton court. we rose and walked together down the avenue. in the thin, the unreal twilight, fitfully like the echo of voices laughing down some alley, geniality returned to me and flesh. against the gateway, against some cedar tree i saw blaze bright, neville, jinny, rhoda, louis, susan, and myself, our life, our identity. still king william seemed an unreal monarch and his crown mere tinsel. but we--against the brick, against the branches, we six, out of how many million millions, for one moment out of what measureless abundance of past time and time to come, burnt there triumphant. the moment was all; the moment was enough. and then neville, jinny, susan and i, as a wave breaks, burst asunder, surrendered--to the next leaf, to the precise bird, to a child with

'when we emerged from that immersion--how sweet, how deep!--and came to the surface and saw the conspirators still standing there it was with some compunction. we had lost what they had kept. we interrupted. but we were tired, and whether it had been good or bad, accomplished or left undone, the dusky veil was falling upon our endeavours; the lights were sinking as we paused for a moment upon the terrace that overlooks the river. the steamers were

 vigilant, and hosts of other things, into the water. i could not recover myself from that endless throwing away, dissipation, flooding forth without our willing it and rushing soundlessly away out there under the arches of the bridge, round some clump of trees or an island, out where sea-birds sit on stakes, over the roughened water to become waves in the sea--i could not recover myself from that dissipation. so we parted.

'was this, then, this streaming away mixed with susan, jinny, neville, rhoda, louis, a sort of death? a new assembly of elements? some hint of what was to come? the note was scribbled, the book shut, for i am an intermittent student. i do not say my lessons by any means at the stated hour. later, walking down fleet street at the rush hour, i recalled that moment; i continued it. "must i for ever," i said, "beat my spoon on the table-cloth? shall i not, too, consent?" the omnibuses were clogged; one came up behind another and stopped with a click, like a link added to a

'what interested the hairdresser? what did the hairdresser see in the street? it is thus that i am recalled. (for i am no mystic; something always plucks at me--curiosity, envy, admiration, interest in hairdressers and the like bring me to the surface.) while he brushed the fluff from my coat i took pains to assure myself of his identity, and then, swinging my stick, i went into the strand, and evoked to serve as opposite to myself the figure of rhoda, always so furtive, always with fear in her eyes, always seeking some pillar in the desert, to find which she had gone; she had killed herself. "wait," i said, putting my arm in imagination (thus we consort with our friends) through her arm. "wait until these omnibuses have gone by. do not cross so dangerously. these men are your brothers." in persuading her i was also persuading my own soul. for this is not one life; nor do i always know if i am man or woman, bernard or neville, louis, susan,

'thus when i come to shape here at this table between my hands the story of my life and set it before you as a complete thing, i have to recall things gone far, gone deep, sunk into this life or that and become part of it; dreams, too, things surrounding me, and the inmates, those old half-articulate ghosts who keep up their hauntings by day and night; who turn over in their sleep, who utter their confused cries, who put out thei
