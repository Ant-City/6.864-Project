a lecture about her experiences? had she not been 
invited to the annual dinner of the aphroditeum club? had she not al- 



ready appeared in the feelytone news-visibly, audibly and tactually 
appeared to countless millions all over the planet? 

hardly less flattering had been the attentions paid her by conspicuous 
individuals. the resident world controller's second secretary had 
asked her to dinner and breakfast. she had spent one week-end with 
the ford chief-justice, and another with the arch-community-songster 
of canterbury. the president of the internal and external secretions 
corporation was perpetually on the phone, and she had been to deau- 
ville with the deputy-governor of the bank of europe. 

"it's wonderful, of course. and yet in a way," she had confessed to 
fanny, "i feel as though i were getting something on false pretences. 
because, of course, the first thing they all want to know is what it's 
like to make love to a savage. and i have to say i don't know." she 
shook her head. "most

"you ought to have asked me first whether i wanted to meet them." 

"but you always came before, john." 

"that's precisely why i don't want to come again." 

"just to please me," bernard bellowingly wheedled. "won't you come 
to please me?" 

"no." 

"do you seriously mean it?" 

"yes." 



despairingly, "but what shall i do?" bernard wailed. 

"go to hell!" bawled the exasperated voice from within. 

"but the arch-community-songster of canterbury is there to-night." 
bernard was almost in tears. 

"ai yaa takwa!" it was only in zuni that the savage could adequately 
express what he felt about the arch-community-songster. "hani!" he 
added as an after-thought; and then (with what derisive ferocity!): 
"sons eso tse-na." and he spat on the ground, as pope might have 
done. 

in the end bernard had to slink back, diminished, to his rooms and in- 
form the impatient assembly that the savage would not be appearing

traught, abject and agitated, he moved among his guests, stammering 
incoherent apologies, assuring them that next time the savage would 
certainly be there, begging them to sit down and take a carotene 
sandwich, a slice of vitamin a pate, a glass of champagne-surrogate. 
they duly ate, but ignored him; drank and were either rude to his face 
or talked to one another about him, loudly and offensively, as though 
he had not been there. 

"and now, my friends," said the arch-community-songster of canter- 
bury, in that beautiful ringing voice with which he led the proceedings 
at ford's day celebrations, "now, my friends, i think perhaps the time 
has come ..." he rose, put down his glass, brushed from his purple vis- 
cose waistcoat the crumbs of a considerable collation, and walked to- 
wards the door. 



bernard darted forward to intercept him. 

"must you really, arch-songster? ... it's very early still. i'd hoped you 
would ..." 

yes, what hadn't he hoped, when lenina confiden

the arch-community-songster would accept an invitation if it were 
sent. "he's really rather sweet, you know." and she had shown ber- 
nard the little golden zipper-fastening in the form of a t which the 
arch-songster had given her as a memento of the week-end she had 
spent at lambeth. to meet the arch-community-songster of canter- 
bury and mr. savage. bernard had proclaimed his triumph on every in- 
vitation card. but the savage had chosen this evening of all evenings 
to lock himself up in his room, to shout "hani!" and even (it was lucky 
that bernard didn't understand zuni) "sons eso tse-na!" what should 
have been the crowning moment of bernard's whole career had turned 
out to be the moment of his greatest humiliation. 

"i'd so much hoped ..." he stammeringly repeated, looking up at the 
great dignitary

 with pleading and distracted eyes. 

"my young friend," said the arch-community-songster in a tone of 
loud and solemn severity; there was a general silence. "let me give 
you a word of advice." he wagged his finger at bernard. "before it's 
too late. a word of good advice." (his voice became sepulchral.) "mend 
your ways, my young friend, mend your ways." he made the sign of 
the t over him and turned away. "lenina, my dear," he called in an- 
other tone. "come with me." 

obediently, but unsmiling and (wholly insensible of the honour done to 
her) without elation, lenina walked a

punctured, utterly deflated, he dropped into a chair and, covering his 
face with his hands, began to weep. a few minutes later, however, he 
thought better of it and took four tablets of soma. 

upstairs in his room the savage was reading romeo and juliet. 

lenina and the arch-community-songster stepped out on to the roof 
of lambeth palace. "hurry up, my young friend-i mean, lenina," 



called the arch-songster impatiently from the lift gates. lenina, who 
had lingered for a moment to look at the moon, dropped her eyes and 
came hurrying across the roof to rejoin him. 

"a new theory of biology" was the title of the paper which mustapha 
mond had just finished reading. he sat for some time, meditatively 
frowning, then picked up his pen and wrote across the title-page: "the

savage now said about the worthlessness of friends who could be 
turned upon so slight a provocation into persecuting enemies. but in 
spite of this knowledge and these admissions, in spite of the fact that 
his friend's support and sympathy were now his only comfort, bernard 
continued perversely to nourish, along with his quite genuine affection, 
a secret grievance against the savage, to mediate a campaign of small 
revenges to be wreaked upon him. nourishing a grievance against the 
arch-community-songster was useless; there was no possibility of be- 
ing revenged on the chief bottler or the assistant predestinator. as a 
victim, the savage possessed, for bernard, this enormous superiority 
over the others: that he was accessible. one of the principal functions 
of a friend is to suffer (in a milder and symbolic form) the punishments 
that we should like, but are unable, to inflict upon our enemies. 
bernard's other victim-friend was helmholtz. when, discomfited, he 
came and asked once more for

chair, he began to suspect that he had been mistaken. 

"lenina!" he repeated apprehensively. 

she put her hand to her neck and gave a long vertical pull; her white 
sailor's blouse was ripped to the hem; suspicion condensed into a too, 
too solid certainty. "lenina, what are you doing?" 

zip, zip! her answer was wordless. she stepped out of her bell- 
bottomed trousers. her zippicamiknicks were a pale shell pink. the 
arch-community-songster's golden t dangled at her breast. 

"for those milk paps that through the window bars bore at men's 
eyes...." the singing, thundering, magical words made her seem dou- 
bly dangerous, doubly alluring. soft, soft, but how piercing! boring and 
drilling into reason, tunnelling through resolution. "the strongest oaths 
are straw to the fire i' the blood. be more abstemious, or else ..." 

zip! the rounded pinkness fell apart like a neatly divided apple. a 
wriggle of the arms, a lifting first of

age indignantly. "why don't you give them these books about god?" 
"for the same reason as we don't give them othello: they're old; 
they're about god hundreds of years ago. not about god now." 
"but god doesn't change." 
"men do, though." 
"what difference does that make?" 

"all the difference in the world," said mustapha mond. he got up again 
and walked to the safe. "there was a man called cardinal newman," 
he said. "a cardinal," he exclaimed parenthetically, "was a kind of 
arch-community-songster." 

'"i pandulph, of fair milan, cardinal.' i've read about them in shake- 
speare." 

"of course you have. well, as i was saying, there was a man called 
cardinal newman. ah, here's the book." he pulled it out. "and while 
i'm about it i'll take this one too. it's by a man called maine de biran. 
he was a philosopher, if you know what that was." 
"a man who dreams of fewer things than there are in heaven and 
earth," said the savage promptly. 

"quite so. i'll read you one of the things he did

meanwhile, listen to what this old arch-community-songster said." he 
opened the book at the place marked by a slip of paper and began to 
read. '"we are not our own any more than what we possess is our 
own. we did not make ourselves, we cannot be supreme over our- 
selves. we are not our own masters. we are god's property. is it not 
our happiness thus to view the matter? is it any happiness or any 
comfort, to consider that we are our own? it may be thought so by the 
young and prosperous. these may think it a great thing to have every-

e here. what made you leave london (hold 



on, edzel!) so very suddenly. and, of course, that whip." (the savage 
started. how did they know about the whip?) "we're all crazy to know 
about the whip. and then something about civilization. you know the 
sort of stuff. 'what i think of the civilized girl.' just a few words, a 
very few ..." 

the savage obeyed with a disconcerting literalness. five words he ut- 
tered and no more-five words, the same as those he had said to ber- 
nard about the arch-community-songster of canterbury. "hani! sons 
eso tse-na!" and seizing the reporter by the shoulder, he spun him 
round (the young man revealed himself invitingly well-covered), aimed 
and, with all the force and accuracy of a champion foot-and-mouth- 
baller, delivered a most prodigious kick. 

eight minutes later, a new edition of the hourly radio was on sale in 
the streets of london. "hourly radio reporter has coccyx 
kicked by mystery savage," ran the headlines on the front page. 
"sensation in surrey."
