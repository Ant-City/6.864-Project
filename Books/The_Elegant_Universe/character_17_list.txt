James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) - 
A Scottish physicist. Maxwell developed the set of
four equations that became the basis of electromagnetic theory,
the single force unifying electricity and magnetism. Maxwell's work had
a huge influence on twentieth-century physics, and he is ranked
alongside Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein for the scope of his
contributions. Maxwell's field equations prompted Max Planck to
formulate the quantum hypothesis--the theory that radiant-heat energy
is emitted only in finite quantities, or quanta.
