dilsey opened it. luster was coming down the drive behind them, carrying 
the umbrella. a woman was with him. "here dey come," dilsey said. they 
passed out the gate. "now, den," she said. ben ceased. luster and his 
mother overtook them. frony wore a dress of bright blue silk and a 
flowered hat. she was a thin woman, with a flat, pleasant face.

     they went on along the street. along its quiet length white people in 
bright clumps moved churchward, under the windy bells, walking now and 
then in the random and tentative sun. the wind was gusty, out of the 
southeast, chill and raw after the warm days.    
     "i wish you wouldn't keep on bringin him to church, mammy," frony 
said. "folks talkin."

     a street turned off at right angles, descending, and became a dirt road. 
on either hand the land dropped more sharply; a broad flat dotted with 
small cabins whose weathered roofs were on a level with the crown of the 
road. they were set in small grassless plots littered with broken things, 
bricks, planks, crockery, things of a once u

     the road rose again, to a scene like a painted backdrop. notched into a 
cut of red clay crowned with oaks the road appeared to stop short off, like a 
cut ribbon. beside it a weathered church lifted its crazy steeple like a 
painted church, and the whole scene was as flat and without perspective as

whispers, they watched the insignificant looking man sitting dwarfed and 
countrified by the minister's imposing bulk, with something like 
consternation. they were still looking at him with consternation and 
unbelief when the minister rose and introduced him in rich, rolling tones

     when the visitor rose to speak he sounded like a white man. his voice 
was level and cold. it sounded too big to have come from him and they 
listened at first through curiosity, as they would have to a monkey talking. 
they began to watch him as they would a man on a tight rope. they even

     "you know whut gwine happen soon es dey start playin dat ball over

     "dey wont start fer a while yit. by dat time t. p. be here to take him

     luster gave her the hat and he and ben went on across the back yard. 
ben was still whimpering, though not loud. dilsey and frony went to the 
cabin. after a while dilsey emerged, again in the faded calico dress, and 
went to the kitchen. the fire had died down. there was no sound in the 
house. she put on the apron and went up stairs. there was no sound 
anywhere. quentin's room was as they had left it. she entered and picked 
up the undergarment and put the stocking back in the drawer and closed it. 
mrs compson's door was closed. dilsey stood beside it for a moment,

      and the library was still locked all the next day too when at three oclock 
in the afternoon, footsore and spent yet still unflagging and still clasping 
the handbag tightly under her arm, she turned into a neat small yard in the 
negro residence section of memphis and mounted the steps of the neat 
small house and rang the bell and the door opened and a black woman of 
about her own age looked quietly out at her. 'it's frony, isn't it?' the 
librarian said. 'dont you remember me--melissa meek, from jefferson--'    
      'yes,' the negress said. 'come in. you want to see mama.' and she 
entered the room, the neat yet cluttered bedroom of an old negro, rank

woman herself sat in a rocker beside the hearth where even though it was 
june a fire smoldered--a big woman once, in faded clean calico and an

already shown the picture to jason.    
      'dont you know what he said?' she cried. 'when he realised she was in 
danger, he said it was her, even if i hadn't even had a picture to show him. 
but as soon as he realised that somebody, anybody, even just me, wanted 
to save her, would try to save her, he said it wasn't. but it is! look at it!'    
      'look at my eyes,' the old negress said. 'how can i see that picture?'    
      'call frony!' the librarian cried. 'she will know her!' but already the old 
negress was folding the clipping carefully back into its old creases, handing 
it back.    
      'my eyes aint any good anymore,' she said. 'i cant see it.'    
      and that was all. at six oclock she fought her way through the crowded 
bus terminal, the bag clutched under one arm and the return half of her 
roundtrip ticket in the other hand, and was swept out onto the roaring 
platform on the diurnal tide of a few middleaged
