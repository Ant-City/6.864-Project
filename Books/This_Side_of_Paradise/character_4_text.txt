_ all right--they know life and are so adorably
tired looking (shakes her head)--but they _will_ dance.

mrs. connage: i haven’t met mr. blaine--but i don’t think you’ll care
for him. he doesn’t sound like a money-maker.

rosalind: mother, i never _think_ about money.

mrs. connage: you never keep it long enough to think about it.

rosalind: (sighs) yes, i suppose some day i’ll marry a ton of it--out of
sheer boredom.

mrs. connage: (referring to note-book) i had a wire from hartford.
dawson ryder is coming up. now there’s a young man i like, and he’s
floating in money. it seems to me that since you seem tired of howard
gillespie you might give mr. ryder some encouragement. this is the third
time he’s been up in a month.

rosalind: how did you know i was tired of howard gillespie?

mrs. connage: the poor boy looks so miserable every time he comes.

rosalind: that was one of those romantic, pre-battle affairs. they’re
all wrong.

mrs. connage: (her say said) at any rate, make us p

can beat a man nowadays.

gillespie: then why do you play with men?

rosalind: (leaning forward confidentially) for that first moment, when
he’s interested. there is a moment--oh, just before the first kiss, a
whispered word--something that makes it worth while.

gillespie: and then?

rosalind: then after that you make him talk about himself. pretty soon
he thinks of nothing but being alone with you--he sulks, he won’t fight,
he doesn’t want to play--victory!

(enter dawson ryder, twenty-six, handsome, wealthy, faithful to his own,
a bore perhaps, but steady and sure of success.)

ryder: i believe this is my dance, rosalind.

rosalind: well, dawson, so you recognize me. now i know i haven’t got
too much paint on. mr. ryder, this is mr. gillespie.

(they shake hands and gillespie leaves, tremendously downcast.)

ryder: your party is certainly a success.

rosalind: is it--i haven’t seen it lately. i’m weary--do you mind
sitting out a minute?

ryder: mind--i’m deli

mrs. connage: who is coming to-night?

(rosalind fails to hear her, at least takes no notice.)

mrs. connage: alec is coming up to take me to this barrie play, “et tu,
brutus.” (she perceives that she is talking to herself.) rosalind! i
asked you who is coming to-night?

rosalind: (starting) oh--what--oh--amory--

mrs. connage: (sarcastically) you have so _many_ admirers lately that i
couldn’t imagine _which_ one. (rosalind doesn’t answer.) dawson ryder
is more patient than i thought he’d be. you haven’t given him an evening
this week.

rosalind: (with a very weary expression that is quite new to her face.)
mother--please--

mrs. connage: oh, _i_ won’t interfere. you’ve already wasted over two
months on a theoretical genius who hasn’t a penny to his name, but _go_
ahead, waste your life on him. _i_ won’t interfere.

rosalind: (as if repeating a tiresome lesson) you know he has a
little income--and you know he’s earning thirty-fiv

amory: rosalind, another night of this and i’ll go to pieces. you’ve
been this way four days now. you’ve got to be more encouraging or i
can’t work or eat or sleep. (he looks around helplessly as if searching
for new words to clothe an old, shopworn phrase.) we’ll have to make a
start. i like having to make a start together. (his forced hopefulness
fades as he sees her unresponsive.) what’s the matter? (he gets up
suddenly and starts to pace the floor.) it’s dawson ryder, that’s what
it is. he’s been working on your nerves. you’ve been with him every
afternoon for a week. people come and tell me they’ve seen you together,
and i have to smile and nod and pretend it hasn’t the slightest
significance for me. and you won’t tell me anything as it develops.

rosalind: amory, if you don’t sit down i’ll scream.

amory: (sitting down suddenly beside her) oh, lord.

rosalind: (taking his hand gently) you know i love you, don’t you?

amory: yes.

amory: don’t talk that way; you frighten me. it sounds as if we weren’t
going to have each other. (she cries a little and rising from the couch
goes to the armchair.) i’ve felt all afternoon that things were worse.
i nearly went wild down at the office--couldn’t write a line. tell me
everything.

rosalind: there’s nothing to tell, i say. i’m just nervous.

amory: rosalind, you’re playing with the idea of marrying dawson ryder.

rosalind: (after a pause) he’s been asking me to all day.

amory: well, he’s got his nerve!

rosalind: (after another pause) i like him.

amory: don’t say that. it hurts me.

rosalind: don’t be a silly idiot. you know you’re the only man i’ve ever
loved, ever will love.

amory: (quickly) rosalind, let’s get married--next week.

rosalind: we can’t.

amory: why not?

rosalind: oh, we can’t. i’d be your squaw--in some horrible place.

rosalind: darling, i don’t even do my own hair, usually.

amory: i’ll do it for you.

rosalind: (between a laugh and a sob) thanks.

amory: rosalind, you _can’t_ be thinking of marrying some one else. tell
me! you leave me in the dark. i can help you fight it out if you’ll only
tell me.

rosalind: it’s just--us. we’re pitiful, that’s all. the very qualities i
love you for are the ones that will always make you a failure.

amory: (grimly) go on.

rosalind: oh--it _is_ dawson ryder. he’s so reliable, i almost feel that
he’d be a--a background.

amory: you don’t love him.

rosalind: i know, but i respect him, and he’s a good man and a strong
one.

amory: (grudgingly) yes--he’s that.

rosalind: well--here’s one little thing. there was a little poor boy we
met in rye tuesday afternoon--and, oh, dawson took him on his lap
and talked to him and promised him an indian suit--and next day he
remembered and bought it--and, oh, it was so sweet and i couldn’t help

rosalind: can’t you see--

amory: i’m afraid i can’t if you love me. you’re afraid of taking two
years’ knocks with me.

rosalind: i wouldn’t be the rosalind you love.

amory: (a little hysterically) i can’t give you up! i can’t, that’s all!
i’ve got to have you!

rosalind: (a hard note in her voice) you’re being a baby now.

amory: (wildly) i don’t care! you’re spoiling our lives!

rosalind: i’m doing the wise thing, the only thing.

amory: are you going to marry dawson ryder?

rosalind: oh, don’t ask me. you know i’m old in some ways--in
others--well, i’m just a little girl. i like sunshine and pretty things
and cheerfulness--and i dread responsibility. i don’t want to think
about pots and kitchens and brooms. i want to worry whether my legs will
get slick and brown when i swim in the summer.

amory: and you love me.

rosalind: that’s just why it has to end. drifting hurts too much. we
can’t have any more scenes like this.

nd in a newspaper what he
had been searching for--a dozen lines which announced to whom it might
concern that mr. amory blaine, who “gave his address” as, etc., had been
requested to leave his hotel in atlantic city because of entertaining in
his room a lady _not_ his wife.

then he started, and his fingers trembled, for directly above was a
longer paragraph of which the first words were:

“mr. and mrs. leland r. connage are announcing the engagement of their
daughter, rosalind, to mr. j. dawson ryder, of hartford, connecticut--”

he dropped the paper and lay down on his bed with a frightened, sinking
sensation in the pit of his stomach. she was gone, definitely, finally
gone. until now he had half unconsciously cherished the hope deep in his
heart that some day she would need him and send for him, cry that it had
been a mistake, that her heart ached only for the pain she had caused
him. never again could he find even the sombre luxury of wanting
her--not this rosalind, harder, older--nor
