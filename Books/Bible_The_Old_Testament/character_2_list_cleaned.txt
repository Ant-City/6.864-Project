[CHARACTER] - 
                the
reluctant savior of israel in its exodus from egyptian bondage to
the promised land. [CHARACTER] mediates between god and the people, transforming the
israelites from an oppressed ethnic group into a nation founded
on religious laws. [CHARACTER]'s legendary miracles before pharaoh, along
with his doubts and insecurities, make him the great mortal hero
of the old testament. he is the only man ever to know god "face to
face." four out of the five books of the pentateuch are devoted
to [CHARACTER] and israel's activities under 
his leadership.
