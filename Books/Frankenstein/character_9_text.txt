ess.  he passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the
affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his
marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a
husband and the father of a family.

as the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, i cannot
refrain from relating them.  one of his most intimate friends was a
merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous
mischances, into poverty.  this man, whose name was beaufort, was of a
proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty
and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been
distinguished for his rank and magnificence.  having paid his debts,
therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his
daughter to the town of lucerne, where he lived unknown and in
wretchedness.  my father loved beaufort with the truest friendship and
was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.

plored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct
so little worthy of the affection that united them.  he lost no time in
endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin
the world again through his credit and assistance.

beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten
months before my father discovered his abode.  overjoyed at this
discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street
near the reuss.  but when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed
him.  beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of
his fortunes, but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for
some months, and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable

oyment in a merchant's house.  the interval was, consequently, spent
in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had
leisure for reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind
that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable
of any exertion.

his daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw
with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that
there was no other prospect of support.  but caroline beaufort
possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support
her in her adversity.  she procured plain work; she plaited straw and
by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to
support life.

several months passed in this manner.  her father grew worse; her time
was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence
decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving
her an orphan and a beggar.  this last blow overcame

by beaufort's coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the
chamber.  he came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who
committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he
conducted her to geneva and placed her under the protection of a
relation.  two years after this event caroline became his wife.

there was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but
this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted
affection.  there was a sen

six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace,
and i stood in the same place where i had last embraced my father
before my departure for ingolstadt.  beloved and venerable parent!  he
still remained to me.  i gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood
over the mantel-piece.  it was an historical subject, painted at my
father's desire, and represented caroline beaufort in an agony of
despair, kneeling by the coffin of her dead father.  her garb was
rustic, and her cheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty,
that hardly permitted the sentiment of pity.  below this picture was a
miniature of william; and my tears flowed when i looked upon it.  while
i was thus engaged, ernest entered:  he had heard me arrive, and
hastened to welcome me:  "welcome, my dearest victor," said he.  "ah! i
wish you had come three months ago, and then you would have
