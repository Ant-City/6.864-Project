the new master and mistress.

        dr. flint, a physician in the neighborhood, had married the sister of my mistress, and i was now the property of their little daughter. it was not without murmuring that i prepared for my new home; and what added to my unhappiness, was the fact that my brother william was purchased by the same family. my father, by his nature, as well as by the habit of transacting business as a skilful mechanic, had more of the feelings of a freeman than is common among slaves. my brother was a spirited boy; and being brought up under such influences, he early detested the name of master and mistress. one day, when his father and his mistress both happened to call him at the same time, he hesitated between the two; being perplexed to know which had the strongest claim upon

        "you don't know any thing about it, linda," he replied. "we shall have to stay here all our days; we shall never be free."

        i argued that we were growing older and stronger, and that perhaps we might, before long, be allowed to hire our own time, and then we could earn money to buy our freedom. william declared this was much easier to say than to do; moreover, he did not intend to buy his freedom. we held daily controversies upon this subject.

        little attention was paid to the slaves' meals in dr. flint's house. if they could catch a bit of food while it was going, well and good. i gave myself no trouble on that score, for on my various errands i passed my grandmother's house, where there was always something to spare for me. i was frequently threatened with punishment if i stopped th

unconsciously the clouds gave place to sunshine. there was a grand big oven there, too, that baked bread and nice things for the town, and we knew there was always a choice bit in store for us.

        but, alas! even the charms of the old oven failed to reconcile us to our hard lot. benjamin was now a tall, handsome lad, strongly and gracefully made, and with a spirit too bold and daring for a slave. my brother william, now twelve years old, had the same aversion to the word master that he had when he was an urchin of seven years. i was his confidant. he came to me with all his troubles. i remember one instance in particular. it was on a lovely spring morning, and when i marked the sunlight dancing here and there, its beauty seemed to mock my sadness. for my master, whose restless, craving, vicious nature roved about day and night, seeking whom to devour, had just left me, with stinging, scorching words; word

        when he told me that i was made for his use, made to obey his command in every thing; that i was nothing but a slave, whose will must and should surrender to his, never before had my puny arm felt half so strong.

        so deeply was i absorbed in painful reflections afterwards, that i neither saw nor heard the entrance of any one, till the voice of william sounded close beside me. "linda," said he, "what makes you look so sad?

page 30
i love you. o, linda, isn't this a bad world? every body seems so cross and unhappy. i wish i had died when poor father did."

        i told him that every body was not cross, or unhappy; that those who had pleasant homes, and kind friends, and who were not afraid to love them, were happy. but we, who were slave-children, without father or mother, could not expect to be happy. we must be good; perhaps that would b

        "yes," he said, "i try to be good; but what's the use? they are all the time troubling me." then he proceeded to relate his afternoon's difficulty with young master nicholas. it seemed that the brother of master nicholas had pleased himself with making up stories about william. master nicholas said he should be flogged, and he would do it. whereupon he went to work; but william fought bravely, and the young master, finding he was getting the better of him, undertook to tie his hands behind him. he failed in that likewise. by dint of kicking and fisting, william came out of the skirmish none the worse for a few scratches.

        he continued to discourse on his young master's meanness; how he whipped the little boys, but was a perfect coward when a tussle ensued between him and white boys of his own size. on such occasions he always took to his legs. william had othe

        one afternoon i sat at my sewing, feeling unusual depression of spirits. my mistress had been accusing

page 33
me of an offence, of which i assured her i was perfectly innocent; but i saw, by the contemptuous curl of her lip, that she believed i was telling a lie.

        i wondered for what wise purpose god was leading me through such thorny paths, and whether still darker days were in store for me. as i sat musing thus, the door opened softly, and william came in. "well, brother," said i, "what is the matter this time?"

        "o linda, ben and his master have had a dreadful time!" said he.

        my first thought was that benjamin was killed. "don't be frightened, linda," said william; "i will tell you all about it."

        it appeared that benjamin's master had sent for him, and he did not immediately obey the summons. when he did, his master was angry, and began to whip him. he resisted. master and slave fought, and finally the master w

        i felt too feeble to dispute with him, and listened to his remarks in silence. his visits were less frequent; but his busy spirit could not remain quiet. he employed my brother in his office, and he was made the medium of frequent notes and messages to me. william was a bright lad, and of much use to the doctor. he had learned to put up medicines, to leech, cup, and bleed. he had taught himself to read and spell. i was proud of my brother; and the old doctor suspected as much. one day, when i had not seen him for several weeks, i heard his steps approaching the

        i was daily hoping to hear that my master had sold my children; for i knew who was on the watch to buy them. but dr. flint cared even more for revenge than he did for money. my brother william, and the good aunt who had served in his family twenty years, and my little benny, and ellen, who was a little over two years old, were thrust into jail, as a means of compelling my relatives to give some information about me. he swore my grandmother should never see one of them again till i was brought back. they kept these facts from me for several days. when i heard that my little ones were in a loathsome jail, my first impulse

        the doctor came back from new york, of course without accomplishing his purpose. he had expended considerable money, and was rather disheartened. my brother and the children had now been in jail two months, and that also was some expense. my friends thought it was a favorable time to work on his discouraged feelings. mr. sands sent a speculator to offer him nine hundred dollars for my brother william, and eight hundred for the two children. these were high prices, as slaves were then selling; but the offer was rejected. if it had been merely a question of money, the doctor would have sold any boy of benny's age for two hundred dollars; but he could not bear to give up the power of revenge. but he was hard pressed for money, and he revolved the matter in his mind. he knew that if he could keep ellen till she was fifteen, he could sell her for a high price; but i presume he reflected that she

 he inquired when he would leave town. "to-day, at ten o'clock," he replied. "ah, do you go so soon?" said the doctor; "i have been reflecting upon your proposition, and i have concluded to let you have the three negroes if you will say nineteen hundred dollars." after some parley,
page 161
the trader agreed to his terms. he wanted the bill of sale drawn up and signed immediately, as he had a great deal to attend to during the short time he remained in town. the doctor went to the jail and told william he would take him back into his service if he would promise to behave himself; but he replied that he would rather be sold. "and you shall be sold, you ungrateful rascal!" exclaimed the doctor. in less than an hour the money was paid, the papers were signed, sealed, and delivered, and my brother and children were in the hands of the trader.

        it was a hurried transaction; and after it was over, the doctor's characteristic caution returned. he went back to the speculator, and said, "sir,

        my grandmother was told that the children would be restored to her, but she was requested to act as if they were really to be sent away. accordingly, she made up a bundle of clothes and went to the jail. when she arrived, she found william handcuffed among the gang, and the children in the trader's cart. the scene seemed too much like a reality. she was afraid there might have been some deception or mistake. she fainted, and was carried home.

        when the wagon stopped at the hotel, several gentlemen came out and proposed to purchase william, but the trader refused their offers, without stating that he was already sold. and now came the trying hour for that drove of human beings, driven away like cattle, to be sold they knew

s were torn from wives, parents from children, never to look upon each other again this side the grave. there was wringing of hands and cries of despair.

        dr. flint had the supreme satisfaction of seeing the wagon leave town, and mrs. flint had the gratification of supposing that my children were going "as far as wind and water would carry them." according to the agreement, my uncle followed the wagon some miles, until they came to an old farm house. there the trader took the irons from william, and as he did so, he said, "you are a damned clever fellow. i should like to own you myself. them gentlemen that wanted to buy you said you was a bright, honest chap, and i must git you a good home. i guess your old master will swear to-morrow, and call himself an old fool for

        much as i despise and detest the class of slave-traders, whom i regard as the vilest wretches on earth, i must do this man the justice to say that he seemed to have some feeling. he took a fancy to william in the jail, and wanted to buy him. when he heard the story of my children, he was willing to aid them in getting out of dr. flint's power, even without charging the customary fee.

        my uncle procured a wagon and carried william and the children back to town. great was the joy in my grandmother's house! the curtains were closed, and the candles lighted. the happy grandmother cuddled the little ones to her bosom. they hugged her, and kissed her, and clapped their hands, and shouted. she k

        dr. flint went to my grandmother's to ascertain who was the owner of my children, and she informed him. "i expected as much," said he. "i am glad to hear it. i have had news from linda lately, and i shall soon have her. you need never expect to see her free. she shall be my slave as long as i live, and when i am dead she shall be the slave of my children. if i ever find out that you or phillip had any thing to do with her running off i'll kill him. and if i meet william in the street, and he presumes to look at me, i'll flog him within an inch of his life. keep those brats out of my sight!"

        as he turned to leave, my grandmother said something to remind him of his own doings. he looked back upon her, as if he would have been glad to strike her to the ground.

        i had my season of joy and thanksgiving. it was the first time since my childhood that i had experienced any real happiness. i heard of the old doctor's threats, but they no longer had the

important era in my brother's life.

        i missed the company and kind attentions of my brother william, who had gone to washington with his master, mr. sands. we received several letters from him, written without any allusion to me, but expressed in such a manner that i knew he did not forget me. i disguised my hand, and wrote to him in the same manner. it was a long session; and when it closed, william wrote to inform us that mr. sands was going to the north, to be gone some time, and that he was to accompany him. i knew that his master had promised to give him his freedom, but no time had been

        grandmother received a letter from mr. sands saying that william had proved a most faithful servant, and he would also say a valued friend; that no mother had ever trained a better boy. he said he had travelled through the northern states and canada; and though the abolitionists had tried to decoy him away, they had never succeeded. he ended by saying they should be at home shortly.

        we expected letters from william, describing the novelties of his journey, but none came. in time, it was reported that mr. sands would return late in the

        at last the day arrived for the return of the travellers. gr

andmother had made loving preparations to welcome her absent boy back to the old hearthstone. when the dinner table was laid, william's plate occupied its old place. the stage coach went by empty. my grandmother waited dinner. she thought perhaps he was necessarily detained by his master. in my prison i listened anxiously, expecting every moment to hear my dear brother's voice and step. in the course of the afternoon a lad was sent by mr. sands to tell grandmother that william did not return with him; that the abolitionists had decoyed him away. but he begged her not to feel troubled about it, for he felt confident she would see william in a few days. as soon as he had time to reflect he would come back, for he could never expect to be so well off at the north as he had been with him.

        if you had seen the tears, and heard the sobs, you would have thought the messenger had brought tidings of death instead of freedom. poor old grandmother felt that she should n

of money, and would naturally feel irritated by the loss he had incurred. i greatly feared this might injure the prospects of my children, who were now becoming valuable property. i longed to have their emancipation made certain. the more so, because their master and father was now married. i was too familiar with slavery not to know that promises made to slaves, though with kind intentions, and sincere at the time, depend upon many contingencies for their fulfillment.

        much as i wished william to be free, the step he had taken made me sad and anxious. the following sabbath was calm and clear; so beautiful that it seemed like a sabbath in the eternal world. my grandmother brought the children out on the piazza, that i might hear their voices. she thought it would comfort me in my despondency; and it did. they chatted merrily, as only children can. benny said, "grandmother, do you think uncle will has gone for good? won't he ever come back again? may be he'll find mother. if he does, w

 don't murmur at de lord's doings, but git down on your knees and tank him for his goodness."

        my selfishness was rebuked by what poor aggie said. she rejoiced over the escape of one who was merely her fellow-bondman, while his own sister was only thinking what his good fortune might cost her children. i knelt and prayed god to forgive me; and i thanked him from my heart, that one of my family was saved from the grasp of slavery.

        it was not long before we received a letter from william. he wrote that mr. sands had always treated him kindly, and that he had tried to do his duty to him faithfully. but ever since he was a boy, he had longed to be free; and he had already gone through

page 205
enough to convince him he had better not lose the chance that offered. he concluded by saying, "don't worry about me, dear grandmother. i shall think of you always, and it will spur me on to work hard and try to do right. when i have earned money enough to give you a home, perhaps you will

 come to the north, and we can all live happy together."

        mr. sands told my uncle phillip the particulars about william's leaving him. he said, "i trusted him as if he were my own brother, and treated him as kindly. the abolitionists talked to him in several places; but i had no idea they could tempt him. however, i don't blame william. he's young and inconsiderate, and those northern rascals decoyed him. i must confess the scamp was very bold about it. i met him coming down the steps of the astor house with his trunk on his shoulder, and i asked him where he was going. he said he was going to change his old trunk. i told him it was rather shabby, and asked if he didn't need some money. he said, no, thanked me, and went off. he did not return so soon as i expected; but i waited patiently. at last i went to see if our trunks w

eligious. he wrote that he hoped god would always bless me, and reward me for my kindness; that he was not unwilling to serve me; but he wanted to be a free man; and that if i thought he did wrong, he hoped i would forgive him. i intended to give him his freedom in five years. he might have trusted me. he has shown himself ungrateful; but i

page 206
shall not go for him, or send for him. i feel confident that he will soon return to me."

        i afterwards heard an account of the affair from william himself. he had not been urged away by abolitionists. he needed no information they could give him about slavery to stimulate his desire for freedom. he looked at his hands, and remembered that they were once in irons. what security had he that they would not be so again? mr. sands was kind to him; but he might indefinitely postpone the promise he had made to give him his freedom. he might come under pecuniary embarrassments, and his property be seized by creditors; or he might die, without mak

he had too often known such accidents to happen to slaves who had kind masters, and he wisely resolved to make sure of the present opportunity to own himself. he was scrupulous about taking any money from his master on false pretences; so he sold his best clothes to pay for his passage to boston. the slaveholders pronounced him a base, ungrateful wretch, for thus requiting his master's indulgence. what would they have done under similar circumstances?

        when dr. flint's family heard that william had deserted mr. sands, they chuckled greatly over the news. mrs. flint made her usual manifestations of christian feeling, by saying, "i'm glad of it. i hope he'll never get him again. i like to see people paid back in their own coin. i reckon linda's children will have to pay for it. i should be glad to see them in the speculator's hands again, for i'm tired of seeing those little niggers march about the streets."

might reckon years of suffering during that festival so joyous to the free. on the new year's day preceding my aunt's death, one of my friends, named fanny, was to be sold at auction to pay her master's debts

urned to my friend's house in an uneasy state of mind. in order to protect my children, it was necessary that i should own myself. i called myself free, and sometimes felt so; but i knew i was insecure. i sat down that night and wrote a civil letter to dr. flint, asking him to state the lowest terms on which he would sell me; and as i belonged by law to his daughter, i wrote to her also, making a similar request.

        since my arrival at the north i had not been unmindful of my dear brother william. i had made diligent inquiries for him, and having heard of him in boston, i went thither. when i arrived there, i found he had gone to new bedford. i wrote to that place, and was informed he had gone on a whaling voyage, and would not return for some months. i went back to new york to get employment near ellen. i received an answer from dr. flint, which gave me no encouragement. he advised me to return and submit myself to my rightful owners, and then any request i might make would be granted.

that it had ceased to be entirely bitter. i loved mrs. bruce's babe. when it laughed and crowed in my face, and twined its little tender arms confidingly about my neck, it made me think of the time when benny and ellen were babies, and my wounded heart was soothed. one bright morning, as i stood at the window, tossing baby in my arms, my attention was attracted by a young man in sailor's dress, who was closely observing every house as he passed. i looked at him earnestly. could it be my brother william? it must be heâ€”and yet, how changed! i placed the baby safely, flew down stairs, opened the front door, beckoned to the sailor, and in less than a minute i was clasped in my brother's arms. how much we had to tell each other! how we laughed, and how we cried, over each other's adventures! i took him to brooklyn, and again saw him with ellen, the dear child whom he had loved and tended so carefully, while i was shut up in my miserable den. he staid in new york a week. his old feelings of affec

        dr. flint made his visit to new york, and made every exertion to call upon me, and invite me to return with him; but not being able to ascertain where i was, his hospitable intentions were frustrated, and the affectionate family, who were waiting for me with "open arms," were doomed to disappointment.

        as soon as i knew he was safely at home, i placed benjamin in the care of my brother william, and returned to mrs. bruce. there i remained through the winter and spring, endeavoring to perform my duties faithfully, and finding a good degree of happiness in the attractions of baby mary, the considerate kindness of her excellent mother, and occasional interviews with my darling daughter.

        but when summer came, the old feeling of insecurity haunted me. it was necessary for me to take little mary out daily, for exercise and fresh air, and

     the fugitive slave law had not then passed. the judges of massachusetts had not then stooped under chains to enter her courts of justice, so called. i knew my old master was rather skittish of massachusetts. i relied on her love of freedom, and felt safe on her soil. i am now aware that i honored the old commonwealth beyond her deserts.

the confession.

        for two years my daughter and i supported ourselves comfortably in boston. at the end of that time, my brother william offered to send ellen to a boarding school. it required a great effort for me to consent to part with her, for i had few near ties, and it was her presence that made my two little rooms seem home-like. but my judgment prevailed over my selfish feelings. i made preparations for her departure. during the two years we had lived together i had often resolved to tell her something about her father; but i had never been able to muster sufficient courage. i had a shrinking dread of diminishing my chil

        the next morning, she and her uncle started on their journey to the village in new york, where she was to be placed at school. it seemed as if all the sunshine had gone away. my little room was dreadfully lonely. i was thankful when a message came from a lady, accustomed to employ me, requesting me to come and sew in her family for several weeks. on my return, i found a letter from brother william. he thought of opening an anti-slavery reading room in rochester, and combining with it the sale of some books and stationery; and he wanted me to unite with him. we tried it, but it was not successful. we found warm anti-slavery friends there, but the feeling was not general enough to support such an establishment. i passed nearly a year in the family of isaac and amy post, practical believers in the christian doctrine of human brotherhood. they measured a man's worth by his character, not by

d was a fugitive, and must leave her to insure his own safety. worse still, many a husband discovered that his wife had fled from slavery years ago, and as "the child follows the condition of its mother," the children of his love were liable to be seized and carried into slavery. every where, in those humble homes, there was consternation and

page 287
anguish. but what cared the legislators of the "dominant race" for the blood they were crushing out of trampled hearts?

        when my brother william spent his last evening with me, before he went to california, we talked nearly all the time of the distress brought on our oppressed people by the passage of this iniquitous law; and never had i seen him manifest such bitterness of spirit, such stern hostility to our oppressors. he was himself free from the operation of the law; for he did not run from any slaveholding state, being brought into the free states by his master. but i was subject to it; and so were hundreds of intelligent and indus

        i had been told that mr. dodge said his wife had never signed away her right to my children, and if he could not get me, he would take them. this it was, more

page 299
than any thing else, that roused such a tempest in my soul. benjamin was with his uncle william in california, but my innocent young daughter had come to spend a vacation with me. i thought of what i had suffered in slavery at her age, and my heart was like a tiger's when a hunter tries to seize her young.

        dear mrs. bruce! i seem to see the expression of her face, as she turned away discouraged by my obstinate mood. finding her expostulations unavailing, she sent ellen to entreat me. when ten o'clock in the evening arrived and ellen had not returned, this watchful and unwearied f
