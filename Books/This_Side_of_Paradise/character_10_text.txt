beside the bed for a cigarette.

“sleep!”

“why not? i’ve got a class at eleven-thirty.”

“you damned gloom! of course, if you don’t want to go to the coast--”

with a bound amory was out of bed, scattering the bureau cover’s burden
on the floor. the coast... he hadn’t seen it for years, since he and his
mother were on their pilgrimage.

“who’s going?” he demanded as he wriggled into his b. v. d.’s.

“oh, dick humbird and kerry holiday and jesse ferrenby and--oh about
five or six. speed it up, kid!”

in ten minutes amory was devouring cornflakes in renwick’s, and at
nine-thirty they bowled happily out of town, headed for the sands of
deal beach.

“you see,” said kerry, “the car belongs down there. in fact, it was
stolen from asbury park by persons unknown, who deserted it in princeton
and left for the west. heartless humbird here got permission from the
city council to deliver it.”

“anybody got any money?” suggested ferrenby, t

its minutest parts and remove it, which only goes to prove the rare
energy of sophomore humor under efficient leadership.

then again, that very fall, burne had caused a sensation. a certain
phyllis styles, an intercollegiate prom-trotter, had failed to get her
yearly invitation to the harvard-princeton game.

jesse ferrenby had brought her to a smaller game a few weeks before,
and had pressed burne into service--to the ruination of the latter’s
misogyny.

“are you coming to the harvard game?” burne had asked indiscreetly,
merely to make conversation.

“if you ask me,” cried phyllis quickly.

“of course i do,” said burne feebly. he was unversed in the arts of
phyllis, and was sure that this was merely a vapid form of kidding.

times, but faith is difficult. one thing i know. if living isn’t a

for a minute neither spoke and then the big man asked:

“what was your university?”

“princeton.”

the big man became suddenly interested; the expression of his goggles
altered slightly.

“i sent my son to princeton.”

“did you?”

“perhaps you knew him. his name was jesse ferrenby. he was killed last
year in france.”

“i knew him very well. in fact, he was one of my particular friends.”

“he was--a--quite a fine boy. we were very close.”

amory began to perceive a resemblance between the father and the
dead son and he told himself that there had been all along a sense of
familiarity. jesse ferrenby, the man who in college had borne off the
crown that he had aspired to. it was all so far away. what little boys
they had been, working for blue ribbons--
