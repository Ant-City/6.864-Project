 "slow down. i thought of that. douglas would pull some legal rabbit out of his hat, a deputation in
force would call, and smith would go right back to pokey. and so would both of us, maybe." he
wrinkled his brow. "but i know one man who could give him shelter and possibly get away with it."

 "that's one of his advantages; everybody knows who he is. it makes him hard to shove around.

important he is so rugged an individualist that he would fight the whole federation departtflent of security

 "safe?"
 "we can't stay here, not very long. they may be checking on every conveyance that left the

ben had intended to take him to jubal harshaw. but she did not know harshaw; she was not even sure
where he lived-somewhere in the poconos, ben had said. well, she would just have to try to find out
where he lived and call him. it was hobson's choice; she had nowhere else to turn.

 jill snapped out of her mood and looked at smith. why, the poor infant didn't even know
anything was wrong! she made a real effort to look at it from his point of view. she failed, but she did

 gillian found that it was not necessary to understand how jubal harshaw's household worked;
she could do as she pleased and nobody cared. after dinner she went into the living room with the
intention of viewing a stereocast of the evening news, being anxious to find out if she herself played a part
in it. but she could find no stereo receiver, nor was there anything which could have concealed a tank.
thinking about it, she could not recall having seen one anywhere in the house. nor were there any

the alarm circuit was missing, there being only a plain cover plate to show where it had been. jill shrugged
and decided that she would probably not oversleep anyway, crawled into bed, slid the spool into the
reading machine, lay back and scanned the words streaming across the ceiling. presently the speed
control slipped out of her relaxed fingers, the lights went out, and she slept.
 jubal harshaw did not get to sleep as easily; he was vexed with himself. his initial interest in the
situation had cooled off and reaction had set in. well over a half century earlier he had sworn a mighty
oath, full of fireworks, never again to pick up a stray cat-and now, so help him, by the multiple paps of
venus genetrix, he had managed to pick up two at once no, three, if he counted ben caxton.

that gillian infant would leave a trail behind her like a club-footed cow! nothing else could be expected.
 whereupon people would come barging into his sanctuary, asking stupid questions and making
stupid demands . . - and he, jubal harshaw, would have to make decisions and take action. since he
was philosophically convinced that all action was futile, the prospect irritated him.
 he did not expect reasonable conduct from human beings; he considered most people fit
candidates for protective restraint and wet packs. he simply wished heartily that they would leave him

 duke had jubal harshaw's stereo receiver hooked up in time to let jubal see a late rebroadcast
of the second phony interview with the "man from mars." the commentary included the rumor about
moving smith to the andes. jubal put two and two together and got twenty-two, after which he was busy
calling people until morning. at dawn dorcas brought him his breakfast, six raw eggs beaten into brandy.

in fact "hurry" was not a concept that could be symbolized
in the martian language and therefore must be presumed to be unthinkable. speed, velocity, simultaneity,
acceleration, and other mathematical abstractions having to do with the pattern of eternity were part of
martian mathematics, but not of martian emotion, contrariwise, the unceasing rush and turmoil of human
existence came not from mathematical necessities of time but from the frantic urgency implicit in human
sexual bipolarity.
 dr. jubal harshaw, professional clown, amateur subversive, and parasite by choice, had long
attempted to eliminate "hurry" and all related emotions from his pattern. being aware that he had but a
short time left to live and having neither martian nor kansan faith in his own immortality, it was his
purpose to live each golden moment as if it were eternity- without fear, without hope, but with sybaritic
gusto. to this end he found that he required something larger than diogenes' tub but smaller than kubla's

pinked him in the quick. so he pushed his advantage. "well? don't just sit there! get gil on your inside
line and tell him you've been keeping jubal harshaw waiting. tell him how long you've kept me waiting."
jubal reviewed in his own excellent memory all that witness cavendish had reported concerning the
missing berquist, plus the report on him from the detective service. yup, he thought happily, this lad is at
least three rungs down the ladder from where berquist was-so let's shake him up a little . . . and climb a
couple of rungs in the process.
