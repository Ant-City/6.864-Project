"that gravel train goes through here in ten minutes."
he jumped off his bunk and in one motion had his bed roll over his shoulders. howie
stared at him in surprise.
"what you doing?"
he gave howie a look to show the whole thing was on howie's shoulders.
"well if you're bound and determined to back out on our agreement i guess there's
nothing i can do to stop you. if we're going to get that gravel train we better be getting
outside."
most of the way riding into shale city he thought about bill harper. he thought to
himself only last night i hit bill harper. he thought to himself bill harper was my best
friend and he was telling me the truth and i hit him for it. he lay back against the gravel
and stared up at the stars. he thought how he and bill harper had sat in the drug store and
how bill harper had hemmed and hawed and how he had finally come to the point. he
remembered all over again the rage he felt when bill harper told him that diane was
going out that night with glen hogan. he knew

 it was probably true or bill harper
wouldn't have told him. yet he had stood up and he had called bill harper a liar and he
had hit bill harper and knocked him down and then he had walked out of the drug store
alone.
on the way home he had run into diane and glen hogan just getting out of glen's
roadster and going into the elysium theatre. then he knew that bill harper had been telling
him the truth. he knew that diane had been cheating on him.
down the block he met howie. howie had been having trouble with onie over glen
hogan so they both decided to leave it all and go out into the desert and work like men
and forget about it. it wasn't like he and howie were the same. howie had never been
able to keep a girl. he kind of resented howie including him in his class. but he wanted
to get away so badly that when howie suggested it he said let's go tomorrow.

ay on the gravel car and remembered all the camping trips and the swell times he
and bill harper had had together. he remembered the first time either of them took a girl
out. they made it a foursome because they were so scared. he remembered the time
major his pup was run over and how bill came over that night with his old man's car and
took him riding out in the country until after midnight and didn't say a word all that time
because bill knew how he felt. he remembered lots of other times too and he thought bill
harper is too good a friend to lose over any girl. he thought bill is too g

 was kissing let her go and diane ran up the steps in that
funny little way she always had and turned just as she got to the door to smile. he
couldn't see her face of course but he knew she was smiling. a minute of that and then
whoever she had been kissing turned away and began coming down the walk. he was
whistling. he was whistling softly and kind of bouncing up and down as he walked away
from having kissed diane. when he got out from between the trees the starlight fell on
his face. it was bill harper.
still he stood there. bill harper walked on down the street and turned the corner. the
light in diane's living room went on and off. next the light in her bedroom came on. he
saw her shadow on the curtain twice as she crossed. then the light went off. he stood
there and thought goodbye diane goodbye.
then he started walking home.
every muscle in his body was sore. his hands and his stomach and his head throbbed
and burned. the bed roll seemed to weigh a hundred pounds almost. but that wasn't w

hurt him. it was something inside of him kept saying you're no good. you're just no good.
people would ask why don't i see you and diane together any more? and there would
be nothing he could say. people would ask what's the matter with you and bill harper
that we don't see you around any more? and there would be nothing he could say. his dad
would ask how come you got a job on the section gang and stayed only one day? and
there would be nothing he could say.
it was all over. it was something he could never explain. something nobody would
understand. he had lost the only friend he might have told it to. because he knew that he
and bill could never again be what they had been. they might shake hands and say forget
it old man and start bumming arou

 like a kid. his hands were bloody and his legs were full of thistles and his eyes
were full of tears and he was sick at heart. it took him a long time to go to sleep.
it all seemed so real at the time and now it wasn't real at all. that was a long time
ago. that was in shale city. that was before he came to los angeles. that was when he
was a kid in high school. it seemed so long ago. somewhere probably in colorado glen
hogan and howie were still kicking around. he had got a letter once saying bill harper
had been killed at belleau wood. bill harper was a lucky guy. bill harper had got diane
and then he had been killed.
oh christ he was all mixed up again. he didn't know where he was or what he was
doing. but he was cooling off. he wasn't burning up any more. he was just light headed
and confused and he couldn't figure things out. everything was a mess but at least he was
cool.

s that it was raining outside because the needles
from the pine kept falling. sitting across from him and staring into the fire was ms father.
each summer they came to this place which was nine thousand feet high and covered
with pine trees and dotted with lakes. they fished in the lakes and when they slept at
night the roar of water from the streams which connected the lakes sounded in their ears
all night long.
they had been coming to this place ever since he was seven. now he was fifteen and
bill harper was going to come tomorrow. he sat in front of the fire and looked across at
his father and wondered just how he was going to tell him. it was a very serious thing.
tomorrow for the first time in all their trips together he wanted to go fishing with
someone other than his father. on previous trips the idea had never occurred to him. his
father had always preferred his company to that of men and he had always preferred his
father's company to that of the other guys. but now bill harper was comin

g up tomorrow
and he wanted to go fishing with him. he knew it was something that had to happen
sometime. yet he also knew that it was the end of something. it was an ending and a
beginning and he wondered just how he should tell his father about it.
so he told him very casually. he said bill harper's coming up tomorrow and i
thought maybe i'd go out with him. he said bill harper doesn't know very much about
fishing and i do so i think if you don't mind i'll get up early in the morning and meet
harper and he and i will go fishing.
for a little while his father didn't say a thing. then he said why sure go along joe.
and then a little later his father said has bill harper got a rod? he told his father no bill
hasn't a rod. well said his father why don't you take my rod and let bill use yours? i don't
want to go fishing tomorrow anyhow. i'm tired and i think i'll rest all

listening new each year. there was nothing his father treasured more. he felt
a little lump in his throat as he thought that even as he was deserting his father for bill
harper his father had volunteered the rod.
they went to sleep that night in the bed which lay against a floor of pine needles.
they had scooped the needles out to make a little hollow place for their hips. he lay
awake quite a while thinking about tomorrow and his father who slept beside him. then
he fell asleep. at six o'clock bill harper whispered to him through the tent flap. he got
up and gave bill his rod and took his father's for himself and they went off without
awakening his father.
it was growing dark when the terrible thing happened. they were in a rowboat
trolling with spinners. they had both lines out. he was rowing and bill harper was at the
stern sitting down facing him and holding a rod out on each side of the boat. it was very
quiet and the lake was glassy still. they were both feeling a little dreamy because they

had had such a wonderful time all day. then there was a sharp whirring sound as the fish
struck. the rod leaped out of bill harper's hand and disappeared into the water. both of
them made wild grabs for it but they were too late. it was his father's rod. they fished
around for more than an hour with the other rod and with the oars of the boat hoping to
raise it but they knew all the while there was no chance. his father's wonderful rod was
gone and they would never see it again.
they beached the boat and cleaned the fish they had caught and then they went over
to the general store for a root beer. they drank their root bee

r and talked in hushed tones
about the rod. then he left bill harper.
all the way to the tent walking under pine trees and over soft needle carpets and
hearing the sound of the streams rushing down the mountain and seeing the stars in the
sky he thought about his father. his father and mother never had much money but they
seemed to get along all right. they had a little house set far back on a long wide lot near
the edge of town. in front of the house there was a space of lawn and between the lawn
and the sidewalk his father had a lot of room for gardening. peop

ike maybe five minutes before his father made a sound. then he turned
slightly over in bed. he felt his father's arm suddenly thrown over his chest. he felt its
warm comforting pressure. well said his father i don't think we should let a little thing
like a fishing rod spoil our last trip together should we?
there was nothing to say so he just lay still. his father had known all along that it
was really their last trip together. from now on in the summers he would come up
camping with guys like bill harper and glen hogan and the rest of them. and his father
would come on fishing trips with men. it had just happened that way. it had to happen
that way. but he lay there in bed beside his father with the two of them jack-knifed
together in the way they always slept best and his father's arm around him and he blinked
back the tears. he and his father had lost everything. themselves and the rod.
he awakened thinking of his father and wondering where the nurse was. he
awakened lonelier than he had been

o glimmer. if he could in some way make
use of vibrations he could communicate with these people. then the glimmer became a
great dazzling white light. it opened up such breathless prospects that he thought he
might suffocate from sheer excitement. vibrations were a very important part of communication.
the fall of a foot on the floor is one kind of vibration. the tap of a telegraph
key is simply another kind.
when he was a kid way back maybe four years ago or five he had a wireless set. he
and bill harper used to telegraph each other. dot dash dot dash dot. particularly on rainy
nights when their folks wouldn't let them go out and there was nothing to do and they just
lounged around the house and got in everybody's way. on such nights he and bill harper
used to dot and dash at each other and they had a hell of a good time. he still remembered
the morse code. all he had to do in order to break through to people in the outside
world was to lie in bed and dot dash to the nurse. then he could talk.

ing sandwiches and she saw them and let out a howl. stumpy
telsa came swinging into the kitchen on her peg leg and grabbed a butcher knife and
came out into the back yard. they all ran like hell with stumpy telsa yelling after them
that she knew who they were and she was going right inside and phone their folks. but it
was a bluff. stumpy hadn't seen their faces and she didn't telephone anybody.
later on when they were seventeen or eighteen and practically ready to get out of
high school he and bill harper decided the hell with talking about the place all the time
so they went down to stumpy telsa's one night to find out for themselves. they walked
right into the front room and nobody pulled a knife on them or anything. it was about
eight o'clock and evidently things weren't busy because stumpy came into the parlor and
talked to them and wasn't sore at all. they were too embarrassed to say anything to
stumpy about why they came and stumpy didn't say anything to them about it either so it

them naked they always wore a kimono or something. nothing they hated said these guys
so much as a man who wanted to see them without any clothes at all. so they sat with
their hearts in their throats and waited and watched.
but when the girls came down they were fully dressed. they were dressed better
than most of the girls in shale city and they were prettier than most of them too. they
came in and sat down and they talked just like anybody else would talk. one of them
seemed to like bill harper the best and the other one seemed to like him. the one who
liked him talked about books all the time. had he read this had he read that and he hadn't
read any of them and he got to feeling pretty much like a dummy. after about a half hour
of munching sandwiches and talking about books stumpy telsa came in all beaming and
smiling and told them it was time to go home. so they got up and shook hands with the
two girls and went away.
that night they took a long walk through the town discussing all
