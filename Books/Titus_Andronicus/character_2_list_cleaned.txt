[CHARACTER]  - 
      
        tamora's moorish lover. shakespeare only created four other black characters before the tragic hero othello, and [CHARACTER] is the most substantial of the four. as he himself admits, there is not a crime in titus in which he has not had a hand. he is practically the engine of action in act ii, bringing tamora's dream of revenge to reality. this simplistic, depthless portraiture of evil is a descendant of the "devil" or "vice" from early elizabethan morality plays, created only to move the audience to contempt. for that reason, there is little about [CHARACTER] to win our sympathy or to even explain the motivation for his evil. his protectiveness of his child presents an interesting contrast in parenthood to tamora and titus.
