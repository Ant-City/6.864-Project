[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER], one of beowulf's kinsmen and thanes, is the only
warrior brave enough to help the hero in his fight against the dragon.
[CHARACTER] conforms perfectly to the heroic code in that he is willing
to die attempting to defeat the opponent and, more importantly,
to save his lord. in this regard, [CHARACTER] appears as a reflection
of the young beowulf in the first part of the story--a warrior who
is strong, fearless, valiant, and loyal. he embodies beowulf's statement
from the early scenes of the poem that it is always better to act
than to grieve. [CHARACTER] thus represents the next generation of heroism
and the future of the kingdom. his bravery and solid bearing provide
the single glint of optimism in the final part of the story, which,
for the most part, is dominated by a tone of despair at what the
future holds.
