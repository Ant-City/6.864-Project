[CHARACTER] 
[CHARACTER] is psychologically detached from the world around
him. events that would be very significant for most people, such
as a marriage proposal or a parent's death, do not matter to him,
at least not on a sentimental level. he simply does not care that
his mother is dead, or that marie loves him. 

[CHARACTER] is also honest, which means that he does not
think of hiding his lack of feeling by shedding false tears over
his mother's death. in displaying his indifference, [CHARACTER] implicitly
challenges society's accepted moral standards, which dictate that
one should grieve over death. because [CHARACTER] does not grieve,
society sees him as an outsider, a threat, even a monster. at his
trial, the fact that he had no reaction to his mother's death damages
his reputation far more than his taking of another person's life. 
	[CHARACTER] is neither moral nor immoral. rather, he is
amoral--he simply does not make the distinction between good and
bad in his own mind. when raymond asks him to write a letter that
will help raymond torment his mistress, [CHARACTER] indifferently
agrees because he "didn't have any reason not to." he does not place
any value judgment on his act, and writes the letter mainly because
he has the time and the ability to do so.
	at the novel's outset, [CHARACTER]'s indifference seems
to apply solely to his understanding of himself. aside from his
atheism, [CHARACTER] makes few assumptions about the nature of the
world around him. however, his thinking begins to broaden once he
is sentenced to death. after his encounter with the chaplain, [CHARACTER] concludes
that the universe is, like him, totally indifferent to human life.
he decides that people's lives have no grand meaning or importance,
and that their actions, their comings and goings, have no effect
on the world. this realization is the culmination of all the events
of the novel. when [CHARACTER] accepts "the gentle indifference of
the world," he finds peace with himself and with the society around
him, and his development as a character is complete.
