the [CHARACTER]  - 
      the [CHARACTER] is a messenger boy who brings lorenzo's empty box to the execution, which is believed to hold a pardon for pedringano. after the [CHARACTER] looks inside, he does not tell anyone that it is empty, out of fear for his own life. this has a distinct impact on the play, since pedringano's belief that he will be pardoned stops him from exposing lorenzo as one of horatio's murderers before it is too late.
