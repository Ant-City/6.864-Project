ere two young boars named snowball and napoleon, whom mr. jones was
breeding up for sale. napoleon was a large, rather fierce-looking
berkshire boar, the only berkshire on the farm, not much of a talker, but
with a reputation for getting his own way. snowball was a more vivacious
pig than napoleon, quicker in speech and more inventive, but was not
considered to have the same depth of character. all the other male pigs on
the farm were porkers. the best known among them was a small fat pig named
squealer, with very round cheeks, twinkling eyes, nimble movements, and a
shrill voice. he was a brilliant talker, and when he was arguing some
difficult point he had a way of skipping from side to side and whisking
his tail which was somehow very persuasive. the others said of squealer
that he could turn black into white.

these three had elaborated old major's teachings into a complete system of
thought, to which they gave the name of animalism. several nights a week,
after mr. jones was asleep, they

hich they caused to be set
against the end wall of the big barn. they explained that by their studies
of the past three months the pigs had succeeded in reducing the principles
of animalism to seven commandments. these seven commandments would now be
inscribed on the wall; they would form an unalterable law by which all the
animals on animal farm must live for ever after. with some difficulty
(for it is not easy for a pig to balance himself on a ladder) snowball
climbed up and set to work, with squealer a few rungs below him holding
the paint-pot. the commandments were written on the tarred wall in great
white letters that could be read thirty yards away. they ran thus:


the seven commandments

1. whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.
2. whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.
3. no animal shall wear clothes.
4. no animal shall sleep in a bed.
5. no animal shall drink alcohol.
6. no animal shall kill any other animal.
7. all animals are equal.

every day into the pigs' mash. the early apples were now ripening, and the
grass of the orchard was littered with windfalls. the animals had assumed
as a matter of course that these would be shared out equally; one day,
however, the order went forth that all the windfalls were to be collected
and brought to the harness-room for the use of the pigs. at this some of
the other animals murmured, but it was no use. all the pigs were in full
agreement on this point, even snowball and napoleon. squealer was sent to
make the necessary explanations to the others.

"comrades!" he cried. "you do not imagine, i hope, that we pigs are doing
this in a spirit of selfishness and privilege? many of us actually dislike
milk and apples. i dislike them myself. our sole object in taking these
things is to preserve our health. milk and apples (this has been proved by
science, comrades) contain substances absolutely necessary to the
well-being of a pig. we pigs are brainworkers. the whole management and

isation of this farm depend on us. day and night we are watching over
your welfare. it is for your sake that we drink that milk and eat those
apples. do you know what would happen if we pigs failed in our duty? jones
would come back! yes, jones would come back! surely, comrades," cried
squealer almost pleadingly, skipping from side to side and whisking his
tail, "surely there is no one among you who wants to see jones come back?"

now if there was one thing that the animals were completely certain of, it
was that they did not want jones back. when it was put to them in this
light, they had no more to say. the importance of keeping the pigs in good
health was all too obvious. so it was agreed without further argument that
the milk and the windfall apples (and also the main crop of appl

s themselves, however, were more
articulate. four young porkers in the front row uttered shrill squeals of
disapproval, and all four of them sprang to their feet and began speaking
at once. but suddenly the dogs sitting round napoleon let out deep,
menacing growls, and the pigs fell silent and sat down again. then the
sheep broke out into a tremendous bleating of "four legs good, two legs
bad!" which went on for nearly a quarter of an hour and put an end to any
chance of discussion.

afterwards squealer was sent round the farm to explain the new arrangement
to the others.

"comrades," he said, "i trust that every animal here appreciates the
sacrifice that comrade napoleon has made in taking this extra labour upon
himself. do not imagine, comrades, that leadership is a pleasure! on the
contrary, it is a deep and heavy responsibility. no one believes more
firmly than comrade napoleon that all animals are equal. he would be only
too happy to let you make your decisions for yourselves. but sometim

might make the wrong decisions, comrades, and then where should we be?
suppose you had decided to follow snowball, with his moonshine of
windmills--snowball, who, as we now know, was no better than a criminal?"

"he fought bravely at the battle of the cowshed," said somebody.

"bravery is not enough," said squealer. "loyalty and obedience are more
important. and as to the battle of the cowshed, i believe the time will
come when we shall find that snowball's part in it was much exaggerated.

not want jones back?"

once again this argument was unanswerable. certainly the animals did not
want jones back; if the holding of debates on sunday mornings was liable

een rubbed off the floor. every
sunday morning at ten o'clock the animals assembled in the big barn to
receive their orders for the week. the skull of old major, now clean of
flesh, had been disinterred from the orchard and set up on a stump at the
foot of the flagstaff, beside the gun. after the hoisting of the flag, the
animals were required to file past the skull in a reverent manner before
entering the barn. nowadays they did not sit all together as they had done
in the past. napoleon, with squealer and another pig named minimus, who
had a remarkable gift for composing songs and poems, sat on the front of
the raised platform, with the nine young dogs forming a semicircle round
them, and the other pigs sitting behind. the rest of the animals sat
facing them in the main body of the barn. napoleon read out the orders for
the week in a gruff soldierly style, and after a single singing of 'beasts
of england', all the animals dispersed.

on the third sunday after snowball's expulsion, the animal

n announce that the windmill was to be built
after all. he did not give any reason for having changed his mind, but
merely warned the animals that this extra task would mean very hard work,
it might even be necessary to reduce their rations. the plans, however,
had all been prepared, down to the last detail. a special committee of
pigs had been at work upon them for the past three weeks. the building of
the windmill, with various other improvements, was expected to take two
years.

that evening squealer explained privately to the other animals that
napoleon had never in reality been opposed to the windmill. on the
contrary, it was he who had advocated it in the beginning, and the plan
which snowball had drawn on the floor of the incubator shed had actually
been stolen from among napoleon's papers. the windmill was, in fact,
napoleon's own creation. why, then, asked somebody, had he spoken so
strongly against it? here squealer looked very sly. that, he said, was
comrade napoleon's cunning. he h

ad seemed to oppose the windmill, simply
as a manoeuvre to get rid of snowball, who was a dangerous character and a
bad influence. now that snowball was out of the way, the plan could go
forward without his interference. this, said squealer, was something
called tactics. he repeated a number of times, "tactics, comrades,
tactics!" skipping round and whisking his tail with a merry laugh. the
animals were not certain what the word meant, but squealer spoke so
persuasively, and the three dogs who happened to be with him growled so
threateningly, that they accepted his explanation without further
questions.




chapter vi



all that year the animals worked like slaves. but they were happy in their
work; they grudged no effort or sacrifice, well aware that everything that
they did was for the benefit of themselves and those of their kind who
would come after them, and not for a pack of idle, thieving human beings.

throughout the spring and s

 to come in contact with human beings, which
would clearly be most undesirable. he intended to take the whole burden
upon his own shoulders. a mr. whymper, a solicitor living in willingdon,
had agreed to act as intermediary between animal farm and the outside
world, and would visit the farm every monday morning to receive his
instructions. napoleon ended his speech with his usual cry of "long live
animal farm!" and after the singing of 'beasts of england' the animals
were dismissed.

afterwards squealer made a round of the farm and set the animals' minds at
rest. he assured them that the resolution against engaging in trade and
using money had never been passed, or even suggested. it was pure
imagination, probably traceable in the beginning to lies circulated by
snowball. a few animals still felt faintly doubtful, but squealer asked
them shrewdly, "are you certain that this is not something that you have
dreamed, comrades? have you any record of such a resolution? is it written
down anywhere?"

contact between animal farm and the outside world, but there were constant
rumours that napoleon was about to enter into a definite business agreement
either with mr. pilkington of foxwood or with mr. frederick of
pinchfield--but never, it was noticed, with both simultaneously.

it was about this time that the pigs suddenly moved into the farmhouse and
took up their residence there. again the animals seemed to remember that a
resolution against this had been passed in the early days, and again
squealer was able to convince them that this was not the case. it was
absolutely necessary, he said, that the pigs, who were the brains of the
farm, should have a quiet place to work in. it was also more suited to the
dignity of the leader (for of late he had taken to speaking of napoleon
under the title of "leader") to live in a house than in a mere sty.
nevertheless, some of the animals were disturbed when they heard that the
pigs not only took their meals in the kitchen and used the drawing-room

finding herself unable to read more than individual letters, she fetched
muriel.

"muriel," she said, "read me the fourth commandment. does it not say
something about never sleeping in a bed?"

with some difficulty muriel spelt it out.

"it says, 'no animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets,"' she announced
finally.

curiously enough, clover had not remembered that the fourth commandment
mentioned sheets; but as it was there on the wall, it must have done so.
and squealer, who happened to be passing at this moment, attended by two
or three dogs, was able to put the whole matter in its proper perspective.

"you have heard then, comrades," he said, "that we pigs now sleep in the
beds of the farmhouse? and why not? you did not suppose, surely, that
there was ever a ruling against beds? a bed merely means a place to sleep
in. a pile of straw in a stall is a bed, properly regarded. the rule was
against sheets, which are a human invention. we have removed the sheets

. still, it had been decided to build the walls three feet thick this
time instead of eighteen inches as before, which meant collecting much
larger quantities of stone. for a long time the quarry was full of
snowdrifts and nothing could be done. some progress was made in the dry
frosty weather that followed, but it was cruel work, and the animals could
not feel so hopeful about it as they had felt before. they were always
cold, and usually hungry as well. only boxer and clover never lost heart.
squealer made excellent speeches on the joy of service and the dignity of
labour, but the other animals found more inspiration in boxer's strength
and his never-failing cry of "i will work harder!"

in january food fell short. the corn ration was drastically reduced, and
it was announced that an extra potato ration would be issued to make up
for it. then it was discovered that the greater part of the potato crop
had been frosted in the clamps, which had not been covered thickly enough.
the potatoes had

 january it became obvious that it would
be necessary to procure some more grain from somewhere. in these days
napoleon rarely appeared in public, but spent all his time in the
farmhouse, which was guarded at each door by fierce-looking dogs. when he
did emerge, it was in a ceremonial manner, with an escort of six dogs who
closely surrounded him and growled if anyone came too near. frequently he
did not even appear on sunday mornings, but issued his orders through one
of the other pigs, usually squealer.

one sunday morning squealer announced that the hens, who had just come in
to lay again, must surrender their eggs. napoleon had accepted, through
whymper, a contract for four hundred eggs a week. the price of these would
pay for enough grain and meal to keep the farm going till summer came on
and conditions were easier.

when the hens heard this, they raised a terrible outcry. they had been
warned earlier that this sacrifice might be necessary, but had not
believed that it would really happen

nd traces of snowball
almost everywhere. he would put his snout to the ground, give several deep
sniffs, ad exclaim in a terrible voice, "snowball! he has been here! i can
smell him distinctly!" and at the word "snowball" all the dogs let out
blood-curdling growls and showed their side teeth.

the animals were thoroughly frightened. it seemed to them as though
snowball were some kind of invisible influence, pervading the air about
them and menacing them with all kinds of dangers. in the evening squealer
called them together, and with an alarmed expression on his face told
them that he had some serious news to report.

"comrades!" cried squealer, making little nervous skips, "a most terrible
thing has been discovered. snowball has sold himself to frederick of
pinchfield farm, who is even now plotting to attack us and take our farm
away from us! snowball is to act as his guide when the attack begins. but
there is worse than that. we had thought that snowball's rebellion was
caused simply by his

aged to formulate his thoughts.

"i do not believe that," he said. "snowball fought bravely at the battle
of the cowshed. i saw him myself. did we not give him 'animal hero, first
class,' immediately afterwards?"

"that was our mistake, comrade. for we know now--it is all written down in
the secret documents that we have found--that in reality he was trying to
lure us to our doom."

"but he was wounded," said boxer. "we all saw him running with blood."

"that was part of the arrangement!" cried squealer. "jones's shot only
grazed him. i could show you this in his own writing, if you were able to
read it. the plot was for snowball, at the critical moment, to give the
signal for flight and leave the field to the enemy. and he very nearly
succeeded--i will even say, comrades, he would have succeeded if it had
not been for our heroic leader, comrade napoleon. do you not remember how,
just at the moment when jones and his men had got inside the yard,
snowball suddenly turned and fled, and many anim

als followed him? and do
you not remember, too, that it was just at that moment, when panic was
spreading and all seemed lost, that comrade napoleon sprang forward with a
cry of 'death to humanity!' and sank his teeth in jones's leg? surely you
remember that, comrades?" exclaimed squealer, frisking from side to side.

now when squealer described the scene so graphically, it seemed to the
animals that they did remember it. at any rate, they remembered that at
the critical moment of the battle snowball had turned to flee. but boxer
was still a little uneasy.

"i do not believe that snowball was a traitor at the beginning," he said
finally. "what he has done since is different. but i believe that at the
battle of the cowshed he was a good comrade."

"our leader, comrade napoleon," announced squealer, speaking very slowly

mly, "has stated categorically--categorically, comrade--that
snowball was jones's agent from the very beginning--yes, and from long
before the rebellion was ever thought of."

"ah, that is different!" said boxer. "if comrade napoleon says it, it must
be right."

"that is the true spirit, comrade!" cried squealer, but it was noticed he
cast a very ugly look at boxer with his little twinkling eyes. he turned
to go, then paused and added impressively: "i warn every animal on this
farm to keep his eyes very wide open. for we have reason to think that
some of snowball's secret agents are lurking among us at this moment!"

four days later, in the late afternoon, napoleon ordered all the animals
to assemble in the yard. when they were all gathered together, napoleon
emerged from the farmhouse, wearing both hi

his that they had built the windmill and faced
the bullets of jones's gun. such were her thoughts, though she lacked the
words to express them.

at last, feeling this to be in some way a substitute for the words she was
unable to find, she began to sing 'beasts of england'. the other animals
sitting round her took it up, and they sang it three times over--very
tunefully, but slowly and mournfully, in a way they had never sung it
before.

they had just finished singing it for the third time when squealer,
attended by two dogs, approached them with the air of having something
important to say. he announced that, by a special decree of comrade
napoleon, 'beasts of england' had been abolished. from now onwards it was
forbidden to sing it.

the animals were taken aback.

"why?" cried muriel.

"it's no longer needed, comrade," said squealer stiffly. "'beasts of
england' was the song of the rebellion. but the rebellion is now
completed. the execution of the traitors this afternoon was the final act.

e was good reason for
killing the traitors who had leagued themselves with snowball.

throughout the year the animals worked even harder than they had worked in
the previous year. to rebuild the windmill, with walls twice as thick as
before, and to finish it by the appointed date, together with the regular
work of the farm, was a tremendous labour. there were times when it seemed
to the animals that they worked longer hours and fed no better than they
had done in jones's day. on sunday mornings squealer, holding down a long
strip of paper with his trotter, would read out to them lists of figures
proving that the production of every class of foodstuff had increased by
two hundred per cent, three hundred per cent, or five hundred per cent,
as the case might be. the animals saw no reason to disbelieve him,
especially as they could no longer remember very clearly what conditions
had been like before the rebellion. all the same, there were days when
they felt that they would sooner have had less fi

gures and more food.

all orders were now issued through squealer or one of the other pigs.
napoleon himself was not seen in public as often as once in a fortnight.
when he did appear, he was attended not only by his retinue of dogs but by
a black cockerel who marched in front of him and acted as a kind of
trumpeter, letting out a loud "cock-a-doodle-doo" before napoleon spoke.
even in the farmhouse, it was said, napoleon inhabited separate apartments
from the others. he took his meals alone, with two dogs to wait upon him,
and always ate from the crown derby

ervice which had been in the
glass cupboard in the drawing-room. it was also announced that the gun
would be fired every year on napoleon's birthday, as well as on the other
two anniversaries.

napoleon was now never spoken of simply as "napoleon." he was always
referred to in formal style as "our leader, comrade napoleon," and this
pigs liked to invent for him such titles as father of all animals, terror
of mankind, protector of the sheep-fold, ducklings' friend, and the like.
in his speeches, squealer would talk with the tears rolling down his
cheeks of napoleon's wisdom the goodness of his heart, and the deep love
he bore to all animals everywhere, even and especially the unhappy animals
who still lived in ignorance and slavery on other farms. it had become
usual to give napoleon the credit for every successful achievement and
every stroke of good fortune. you would often hear one hen remark to
another, "under the guidance of our leader, comrade napoleon, i have laid
five eggs in six days";

napoleon approved of this poem and caused it to be inscribed on the wall
of the big barn, at the opposite end from the seven commandments. it was
surmounted by a portrait of napoleon, in profile, executed by squealer in
white paint.

meanwhile, through the agency of whymper, napoleon was engaged in
complicated negotiations with frederick and pilkington. the pile of timber
was still unsold. of the two, frederick was the more anxious to get hold
of it, but he would not offer a reasonable price. at the same time there
were renewed rumours that frederick and his men were plotting to attack
animal farm and to destroy the windmill, the building of which had aroused
furious jealousy in him. snowball was known to b

frederick practised upon his animals. he had flogged an old horse to
death, he starved his cows, he had killed a dog by throwing it into the
furnace, he amused himself in the evenings by making cocks fight with
splinters of razor-blade tied to their spurs. the animals' blood boiled
with rage when they heard of these things being done to their comrades,
and sometimes they clamoured to be allowed to go out in a body and attack
pinchfield farm, drive out the humans, and set the animals free. but
squealer counselled them to avoid rash actions and trust in comrade
napoleon's strategy.

nevertheless, feeling against frederick continued to run high. one sunday
morning napoleon appeared in the barn and explained that he had never at
any time contemplated selling the pile of timber to frederick; he
considered it beneath his dignity, he said, to have dealings with
scoundrels of that description. the pigeons who were still sent out to
spread tidings of the rebellion were forbidden to set foot anywhere

on
foxwood, and were also ordered to drop their former slogan of "death to
humanity" in favour of "death to frederick." in the late summer yet
another of snowball's machinations was laid bare. the wheat crop was full
of weeds, and it was discovered that on one of his nocturnal visits
snowball had mixed weed seeds with the seed corn. a gander who had been
privy to the plot had confessed his guilt to squealer and immediately
committed suicide by swallowing deadly nightshade berries. the animals
now also learned that snowball had never--as many of them had believed
hitherto--received the order of "animal hero, first class." this was
merely a legend which had been spread some time after the battle of the
cowshed by snowball himself. so far from being decorated, he had been
censured for showing cowardice in the battle. once again some of the
animals heard this with a certain bewilderment, but squealer

ginated with
snowball and his agents. it now appeared that snowball was not, after all,
hiding on pinchfield farm, and in fact had never been there in his life:
he was living--in considerable luxury, so it was said--at foxwood, and had
in reality been a pensioner of pilkington for years past.

the pigs were in ecstasies over napoleon's cunning. by seeming to be
friendly with pilkington he had forced frederick to raise his price by
twelve pounds. but the superior quality of napoleon's mind, said squealer,
was shown in the fact that he trusted nobody, not even frederick.
frederick had wanted to pay for the timber with something called a cheque,
which, it seemed, was a piece of paper with a promise to pay written upon
it. but napoleon was too clever for him. he had demanded payment in real
five-pound notes, which were to be handed over before the timber was
removed. already frederick had paid up; and the sum he had paid was just
enough to buy the machinery for the windmill.

meanwhile the timber

s. and for a little while they halted in
sorrowful silence at the place where the windmill had once stood. yes, it
was gone; almost the last trace of their labour was gone! even the
foundations were partially destroyed. and in rebuilding it they could not
this time, as before, make use of the fallen stones. this time the stones
had vanished too. the force of the explosion had flung them to distances
of hundreds of yards. it was as though the windmill had never been.

as they approached the farm squealer, who had unaccountably been absent
during the fighting, came skipping towards them, whisking his tail and
beaming with satisfaction. and the animals heard, from the direction of
the farm buildings, the solemn booming of a gun.

"what is that gun firing for?" said boxer.

"to celebrate our victory!" cried squealer.

"what victory?" said boxer. his knees were bleeding, he had lost a shoe
and split his hoof, and a dozen pellets had lodged themselves in his hind
leg.

"what victory, comrade? have w

arm?"

"but they have destroyed the windmill. and we had worked on it for two
years!"

"what matter? we will build another windmill. we will build six windmills
if we feel like it. you do not appreciate, comrade, the mighty thing that
we have done. the enemy was in occupation of this very ground that we
stand upon. and now--thanks to the leadership of comrade napoleon--we have
won every inch of it back again!"

"then we have won back what we had before," said boxer.

"that is our victory," said squealer.

they limped into the yard. the pellets under the skin of boxer's leg
smarted painfully. he saw ahead of him the heavy labour of rebuilding the
windmill from the foundations, and already in imagination he braced
himself for the task. but for the first time it occurred to him that he
was eleven years old and that perhaps his great muscles were not quite
what they had once been.

but when the animals saw the green flag flying, and heard the gun firing
again--seven times it was fired in all--and

 when
the house was first occupied. that night there came from the farmhouse the
sound of loud singing, in which, to everyone's surprise, the strains of
'beasts of england' were mixed up. at about half past nine napoleon,
wearing an old bowler hat of mr. jones's, was distinctly seen to emerge
from the back door, gallop rapidly round the yard, and disappear indoors
again. but in the morning a deep silence hung over the farmhouse. not a
pig appeared to be stirring. it was nearly nine o'clock when squealer made
his appearance, walking slowly and dejectedly, his eyes dull, his tail
hanging limply behind him, and with every appearance of being seriously
ill. he called the animals together and told them that he had a terrible
piece of news to impart. comrade napoleon was dying!

a cry of lamentation went up. straw was laid down outside the doors of the
farmhouse, and the animals walked on tiptoe. with tears in their eyes they
asked one another what they should do if their leader were taken away from

them. a rumour went round that snowball had after all contrived to
introduce poison into napoleon's food. at eleven o'clock squealer came
out to make another announcement. as his last act upon earth, comrade
napoleon had pronounced a solemn decree: the drinking of alcohol was to be
punished by death.

by the evening, however, napoleon appeared to be somewhat better, and the
following morning squealer was able to tell them that he was well on the
way to recovery. by the evening of that day napoleon was back at work, and
on the next day it was learned that he had instructed whymper to purchase
in willingdon some booklets on brewing and distilling. a week later
napoleon gave orders that the small paddock beyond the orchard, which it
had previously been intended to set aside as a grazing-ground for animals
who were past work, was to be ploughed up. it was given out that the
pasture was exhauste

d and needed re-seeding; but it soon became known that
napoleon intended to sow it with barley.

about this time there occurred a strange incident which hardly anyone was
able to understand. one night at about twelve o'clock there was a loud
crash in the yard, and the animals rushed out of their stalls. it was a
moonlit night. at the foot of the end wall of the big barn, where the
seven commandments were written, there lay a ladder broken in two pieces.
squealer, temporarily stunned, was sprawling beside it, and near at hand
there lay a lantern, a paint-brush, and an overturned pot of white paint.
the dogs immediately made a ring round squealer, and escorted him back to
the farmhouse as soon as he was able to walk. none of the animals could
form any idea as to what this meant, except old benjamin, who nodded his
muzzle with a knowing air, and seemed to understand, but would say nothing.

but a few days later muriel, reading over the seven commandments

to a grazing-ground for superannuated
animals. for a horse, it was said, the pension would be five pounds of
corn a day and, in winter, fifteen pounds of hay, with a carrot or
possibly an apple on public holidays. boxer's twelfth birthday was due in
the late summer of the following year.

meanwhile life was hard. the winter was as cold as the last one had been,
and food was even shorter. once again all rations were reduced, except
those of the pigs and the dogs. a too rigid equality in rations, squealer
explained, would have been contrary to the principles of animalism. in any
case he had no difficulty in proving to the other animals that they were
not in reality short of food, whatever the appearances might be. for the
time being, certainly, it had been found necessary to make a readjustment
of rations (squealer always spoke of it as a "readjustment," never as a
"reduction"), but in comparison with the days of jones, the improvement
was enormous. reading out the figures in a shrill, rapid voi

ir stalls and suffered less from fleas. the animals
believed every word of it. truth to tell, jones and all he stood for had
almost faded out of their memories. they knew that life nowadays was harsh
and bare, that they were often hungry and often cold, and that they were
usually working when they were not asleep. but doubtless it had been worse
in the old days. they were glad to believe so. besides, in those days they
had been slaves and now they were free, and that made all the difference,
as squealer did not fail to point out.

there were many more mouths to feed now. in the autumn the four sows had
all littered about simultaneously, producing thirty-one young pigs between
them. the young pigs were piebald, and as napoleon was the only boar on
the farm, it was possible to guess at their parentage. it was announced
that later, when bricks and timber had been purchased, a schoolroom would
be built in the farmhouse garden. for the time being, the young pigs were
given their instruction by napo

then the sheep, and then the poultry. the dogs flanked the procession and
at the head of all marched napoleon's black cockerel. boxer and clover
always carried between them a green banner marked with the hoof and the
horn and the caption, "long live comrade napoleon!" afterwards there were
recitations of poems composed in napoleon's honour, and a speech by
squealer giving particulars of the latest increases in the production of
foodstuffs, and on occasion a shot was fired from the gun. the sheep were
the greatest devotees of the spontaneous demonstration, and if anyone
complained (as a few animals sometimes did, when no pigs or dogs were near)
that they wasted time and meant a lot of standing about in the cold, the
sheep were sure to silence him with a tremendous bleating of "four legs
good, two legs bad!" but by and large the animals enjoyed these

ations. they found it comforting to be reminded that, after all,
they were truly their own masters and that the work they did was for their
own benefit. so that, what with the songs, the processions, squealer's
lists of figures, the thunder of the gun, the crowing of the cockerel,
and the fluttering of the flag, they were able to forget that their
bellies were empty, at least part of the time.

in april, animal farm was proclaimed a republic, and it became necessary
to elect a president. there was only one candidate, napoleon, who was
elected unanimously. on the same day it was given out that fresh documents
had been discovered which revealed further details about snowball's
complicity with jones. i

!" she cried, "how are you?"

"it is my lung," said boxer in a weak voice. "it does not matter. i think
you will be able to finish the windmill without me. there is a pretty good
store of stone accumulated. i had only another month to go in any case.
to tell you the truth, i had been looking forward to my retirement. and
perhaps, as benjamin is growing old too, they will let him retire at the
same time and be a companion to me."

"we must get help at once," said clover. "run, somebody, and tell squealer
what has happened."

all the other animals immediately raced back to the farmhouse to give
squealer the news. only clover remained, and benjamin who lay down at
boxer's side, and, without speaking, kept the flies off him with his long
tail. after about a quarter of an hour squealer appeared, full of sympathy
and concern. he said that comrade napoleon had learned with the very
deepest distress of this misfortune to one of the most loyal workers on
the farm, and was already making arrangements to

except for mollie and snowball, no other animal had ever left the farm,
and they did not like to think of their sick comrade in the hands of human
beings. however, squealer easily convinced them that the veterinary
surgeon in willingdon could treat boxer's case more satisfactorily than
could be done on the farm. and about half an hour later, when boxer had
somewhat recovered, he was with difficulty got on to his feet, and managed
to limp back to his stall, where clover and benjamin had prepared a good
bed of straw for him.

for the next two days boxer remained in his stall. the pigs had sent out a
large bottle of pink medicine which they had found in the medicine

what was happening, merely set back their ears and quickened their pace.
boxer's face did not reappear at the window. too late, someone thought of
racing ahead and shutting the five-barred gate; but in another moment the
van was through it and rapidly disappearing down the road. boxer was never
seen again.

three days later it was announced that he had died in the hospital at
willingdon, in spite of receiving every attention a horse could have.
squealer came to announce the news to the others. he had, he said, been
present during boxer's last hours.

"it was the most affecting sight i have ever seen!" said squealer, lifting
his trotter and wiping away a tear. "i was at his bedside at the very
last. and at the end, almost too weak to speak, he whispered in my ear
that his sole sorrow was to have passed on before the windmill was
finished. 'forward, comrades!' he whispered. 'forward in the name of the
rebellion. long live animal farm! long live

comrade napoleon! napoleon is
always right.' those were his very last words, comrades."

here squealer's demeanour suddenly changed. he fell silent for a moment,
and his little eyes darted suspicious glances from side to side before he
proceeded.

it had come to his knowledge, he said, that a foolish and wicked rumour
had been circulated at the time of boxer's removal. some of the animals
had noticed that the van which took boxer away was marked "horse
slaughterer," and had actually jumped to the conclusion that boxer was
being sent to the knacker's. it was almost unbelievable, said squealer,
th

at any animal could be so stupid. surely, he cried indignantly, whisking
his tail and skipping from side to side, surely they knew their beloved
leader, comrade napoleon, better than that? but the explanation was really
very simple. the van had previously been the property of the knacker, and
had been bought by the veterinary surgeon, who had not yet painted the old
name out. that was how the mistake had arisen.

the animals were enormously relieved to hear this. and when squealer went
on to give further graphic details of boxer's death-bed, the admirable
care he had received, and the expensive medicines for which napoleon had
paid without a thought as to the cost, their last doubts disappeared and
the sorrow that they felt for their comrade's death was tempered by the
thought that at least he had died happy.

napoleon himself appeared at the meeting on the following sunday morning
and pronounced a short oration in boxer's honour. it had not been
possible, he said, to br

snowball was forgotten. boxer was forgotten, except by the few who had
known him. clover was an old stout mare now, stiff in the joints and with
a tendency to rheumy eyes. she was two years past the retiring age, but in
fact no animal had ever actually retired. the talk of setting aside a
corner of the pasture for superannuated animals had long since been
dropped. napoleon was now a mature boar of twenty-four stone. squealer was
so fat that he could with difficulty see out of his eyes. only old
benjamin was much the same as ever, except for being a little greyer about
the muzzle, and, since boxer's death, more morose and taciturn than ever.

there were many more creatures on the farm now, though the increase was
not so great as had been expected in earlier years. many animals had been
born to whom the rebellion was only a dim tradition, passed on by word of
mouth, and others had been bought who had never heard ment

the three-day week, were no
longer talked about. napoleon had denounced such ideas as contrary to the
spirit of animalism. the truest happiness, he said, lay in working hard
and living frugally.

somehow it seemed as though the farm had grown richer without making the
animals themselves any richer-except, of course, for the pigs and the
dogs. perhaps this was partly because there were so many pigs and so many
dogs. it was not that these creatures did not work, after their fashion.
there was, as squealer was never tired of explaining, endless work in the
supervision and organisation of the farm. much of this work was of a kind
that the other animals were too ignorant to understand. for example,
squealer told them that the pigs had to expend enormous labours every day
upon mysterious things called "files," "reports," "minutes," and
"memoranda". these were large sheets of paper which had to be closely
covered with writing, and as soon as they were so covered, they were burnt
in the furnace. this

was of the highest importance for the welfare of the
farm, squealer said. but still, neither pigs nor dogs produced any food by
their own labour; and there were very many of them, and their appetites
were always good.

as for the others, their life, so far as they knew, was as it had always
been. they were generally hungry, they slept on straw, they drank from the
pool, they laboured in the fields; in winter they were troubled by the
cold, and in summer by the flies. sometimes the older ones among them
racked their dim memories and tried to determine whether in

 the early
days of the rebellion, when jones's expulsion was still recent, things had
been better or worse than now. they could not remember. there was nothing
with which they could compare their present lives: they had nothing to go
upon except squealer's lists of figures, which invariably demonstrated
that everything was getting better and better. the animals found the
problem insoluble; in any case, they had little time for speculating on
such things now. only old benjamin professed to remember every detail of
his long life and to know that things never had been, nor ever could be
much better or much worse--hunger, hardship, and disappointment being, so
he said, the unalterable law of life.

and yet the animals never gave up hope. more, they

ry animal on the farm knew it, though no one would have dared to
sing it aloud. it might be that their lives were hard and that not all of
their hopes had been fulfilled; but they were conscious that they were not
as other animals. if they went hungry, it was not from feeding tyrannical
human beings; if they worked hard, at least they worked for themselves.
no creature among them went upon two legs. no creature called any other
creature "master." all animals were equal.

one day in early summer squealer ordered the sheep to follow him, and led
them out to a piece of waste ground at the other end of the farm, which
had become overgrown with birch saplings. the sheep spent the whole day
there browsing at the leaves under squealer's supervision. in the evening
he returned to the farmhouse himself, but, as it was warm weather, told
the sheep to stay where they were. it ended by their remaining there for a
whole week, during which time the other animals saw nothing of them.
squealer was with them f

new song, for which privacy was needed.

it was just after the sheep had returned, on a pleasant evening when the
animals had finished work and were making their way back to the farm
buildings, that the terrified neighing of a horse sounded from the yard.
startled, the animals stopped in their tracks. it was clover's voice. she
neighed again, and all the animals broke into a gallop and rushed into the
yard. then they saw what clover had seen.

it was a pig walking on his hind legs.

yes, it was squealer. a little awkwardly, as though not quite used to
supporting his considerable bulk in that position, but with perfect
balance, he was strolling across the yard. and a moment later, out from
the door of the farmhouse came a long file of pigs, all walking on their
hind legs. some did it better than others, one or two were even a trifle
unsteady and looked as though they would have liked the support of a
stick, but every one of them made his way right round the yard
successfully. and finally there
