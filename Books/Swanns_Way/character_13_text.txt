ncreased her anxiety by telling her that there was
a painter at work in the church copying the window of gilbert the
bad. françoise was at once dispatched to the grocer's, but returned
empty-handed owing to the absence of théodore, whose dual profession of
choirman, with a part in the maintenance of the fabric, and of grocer's
assistant gave him not only relations with all sections of society, but
an encyclopaedic knowledge of their affairs.

"ah!" my aunt would sigh, "i wish it were time for eulalie to come. she
is really the only person who will be able to tell me."

eulalie was a limping, energetic, deaf spinster who had 'retired' after
the death of mme. de la bretonnerie, with whom she had been in service
from her childhood, and had then taken a room beside the church, from
which she would incessantly emerge, either to attend some service,
or, when there was no service, to say a prayer by herself or to give
théodore a hand; the rest of her time she spent in visiting sick persons

d) for having them sent away, and at their look of discomfiture
when they had to turn back without having seen her; and would be filled
with secret admiration for her mistress, whom she felt to be superior
to all these other people, inasmuch as she could and did contrive not to
see them. in short, my aunt stipulated, at one and the same time, that
whoever came to see her must approve of her way of life, commiserate
with her in her sufferings, and assure her of an ultimate recovery.

in all this eulalie excelled. my aunt might say to her twenty times in
a minute: "the end is come at last, my poor eulalie!", twenty times
eulalie would retort with: "knowing your illness as you do, mme.
octave, you will live to be a hundred, as mme. sazerin said to me only
yesterday." for one of eulalie's most rooted beliefs, and one that the
formidable list of corrections which her experience must have compiled
was powerless to eradicate, was that mme. sazerat's name was really mme.
sazerin.

ve to a hundred," my aunt would say, for she
preferred to have no definite limit fixed to the number of her days.

and since, besides this, eulalie knew, as no one else knew, how to
distract my aunt without tiring her, her visits, which took place
regularly every sunday, unless something unforeseen occurred to prevent
them, were for my aunt a pleasure the prospect of which kept her on
those days in a state of expectation, appetising enough to begin with,
but at once changing to the agony of a hunger too long unsatisfied if
eulalie were a minute late in coming. for, if unduly prolonged, the
rapture of waiting for eulalie became a torture, a

cease from looking at the time, and yawning, and complaining of each of
her symptoms in turn. eulalie's ring, if it sounded from the front door
at the very end of the day, when she was no longer expecting it, would
almost make her ill. for the fact was that on sundays she thought of
nothing else than this visit, and the moment that our luncheon was ended
françoise would become impatient for us to leave the dining-room so that
she might go upstairs to 'occupy' my aunt. but--and this more than ever
from the day on which fine weather definitely set in at combray--the

ding in the garden, a thing my great-aunt would never
have understood my doing save on a sunday, that being the day on which
it was unlawful to indulge in any serious occupation, and on which she
herself would lay aside her sewing (on a week-day she would have said,
"how you can go on amusing yourself with a book; it isn't sunday, you
know!" putting into the word 'amusing' an implication of childishness
and waste of time), my aunt léonie would be gossiping with françoise
until it was time for eulalie to arrive. she would tell her that she had
just seen mme. goupil go by "without an umbrella, in the silk dress
she had made for her the other day at châteaudun. if she has far to go
before vespers, she may get it properly soaked."

"very likely" (which meant also "very likely not") was the answer,
for françoise did not wish definitely to exclude the possibility of a
happier alternative.

"there, now," went on my aunt, beating her brow, "that reminds me that

behind the steeple, and how poor the light is on the slates, you may be
certain it will rain before the day is out. it couldn't possibly keep on
like this, it's been too hot. and the sooner the better, for until the
storm breaks my vichy water won't 'go down,'" she concluded, since, in
her mind, the desire to accelerate the digestion of her vichy water was
of infinitely greater importance than her fear of seeing mme. goupil's
new dress ruined.

"i'm not at all surprised," said my aunt, looking up towards the sky.
"i've always said that she was not in the least like other people. well,
i'm glad it's she and not myself who's outside in all this."

"mme. amédée is always the exact opposite of the rest," said françoise,
not unkindly, refraining until she should be alone with the other
servants from stating her belief that my grandmother was 'a bit off her
head.'

"there's benediction over! eulalie will never come now," sighed my aunt.
"it will be the weather that's frightened her away."

"but it's not five o'clock yet, mme. octave, it's only half-past four."

"only half-past four! and here am i, obliged to draw back the small
curtains, just to get a tiny streak of daylight. at half-past four! only
a week before the rogation-days. ah, my poor françoise, the dear lord
must be sorely vexed with us. the world is going too far in these days.

is taking vengeance upon us."

a bright flush animated my aunt's cheeks; it was eulalie. as ill luck
would have it, scarcely had she been admitted to the presence when
françoise reappeared and, with a smile which was meant to indicate her
full participation in the pleasure which, she had no doubt, her tidings
would give my aunt, articulating each syllable so as to shew that, in
spite of her having to translate them into indirect speech, she was
repeating, as a good servant should, the very words which the new
visitor had condescended to use, said: "his reverence the curé would b

correspond to what was felt by her
invalid. the curé (an excellent man, with whom i am sorry now that i did
not converse more often, for, even if he cared nothing for the arts,
he knew a great many etymologies), being in the habit of shewing
distinguished visitors over his church (he had even planned to compile
a history of the parish of combray), used to weary her with his endless
explanations, which, incidentally, never varied in the least degree.
but when his visit synchronized exactly with eulalie's it became frankly
distasteful to my aunt. she would have preferred to make the most of
eulalie, and not to have had the whole of her circle about her at one
time. but she dared not send the curé away, and had to content herself
with making a sign to eulalie not to leave when he did, so that she
might have her to herself for a little after he had gone.

easel in your church, and is copying one of the windows? old as i am

n from saint hilaire."

"but i don't see where saint hilaire comes in."

"why yes, have you never noticed, in the corner of the window, a lady in
a yellow robe? very well, that is saint hilaire, who is also known, you
will remember, in certain parts of the country as saint illiers, saint
hèlier, and even, in the jura, saint ylie. but these various corruptions
of _sanctus hilarius_ are by no means the most curious that have
occurred in the names of the blessed saints. take, for example, my good
eulalie, the case of your own patron, _sancta eulalia_; do you know what
she has become in burgundy? saint eloi, nothing more nor less! the lady
has become a gentleman. do you hear that, eulalie, after you are dead
they will make a man of you!"

"father will always have his joke."

"gilbert's brother, charles the stammerer, was a pious prince, but,
having early in life lost his father, pepin the mad, who died as a
result of his mental infirmity, he wielded the supreme power with all
the arrogance of a

countryside is spread out before you like a

great rifts in the town, slicing it up so neatly that it looks like a

get it all quite perfect you would have to be in both places at once; up
here on the top of saint-hilaire and down there at jouy-le-vicomte."

the curé had so much exhausted my aunt that no sooner had he gone than
she was obliged to send away eulalie also.

"here, my poor eulalie," she said in a feeble voice, drawing a coin from
a small purse which lay ready to her hand. "this is just something so
that you shall not forget me in your prayers."

"oh, but, mme. octave, i don't think i ought to; you know very well
that i don't come here for that!" so eulalie would answer, with the
same hesitation and the same embarrassment, every sunday, as though
each temptation were the first, and with a look of displeasure which
enlivened my aunt and never

offended her, for if it so happened that
eulalie, when she took the money, looked a little less sulky than usual,
my aunt would remark afterwards, "i cannot think what has come over
eulalie; i gave her just the trifle i always give, and she did not look
at all pleased."

"i don't think she has very much to complain of, all the same,"
françoise would sigh grimly, for she had a tendency to regard as petty
cash all that my aunt might give her for herself or her children, and as
treasure riotously squandered on a pampered and ungrateful darling the
little coins slipped, sunday by sunday, into eulalie's hand, but so
discreetly passed that françoise never managed to see them. it was

ot that she wanted to have for herself the money my aunt bestowed
on eulalie. she already enjoyed a sufficiency of all that my
aunt possessed, in the knowledge that the wealth of the mistress
automatically ennobled and glorified the maid in the eyes of the world;
and that she herself was conspicuous and worthy to be praised throughout
combray, jouy-le-vicomte, and other cities of men, on account of my
aunt's many farms, her frequent and prolonged visits from the curé, and
the astonishing number of bottles of vichy water which she consumed.

people whom she despised even more if they did not address her always
as "mme. françoise," just to shew that they considered themselves to be
'not as good.' and when she saw that, despite all her warnings, my aunt
continued to do exactly as she pleased, and to fling money away with
both hands (or so, at least, françoise believed) on undeserving objects,
she began to find that the presents she herself received from my aunt
were very tiny compared to the imaginary riches squandered upon
eulalie, there was not, in the neighbourhood of combray, a farm of such
prosperity and importance that françoise doubted eulalie's ability to
buy it, without thinking twice, out of the capital which her visits to
my aunt had 'brought in.' it must be added that eulalie had formed an
exactly similar estimate of the vast and secret hoards of françoise.
so, every sunday, after eulalie had gone, françoise would mercilessly
prophesy her coming downfall. she hated eulalie, but was at the same
time afraid o

f her, and so felt bound, when eulalie was there, to 'look
pleasant.' but she would make up for that after the other's departure;
never, it is true, alluding to her by name, but hinting at her in
sibylline oracles, or in utterances of a comprehensive character, like
those of ecclesiastes, the preacher, but so worded that their special
application could not escape my aunt. after peering out at the side of
the curtain to see whether eulalie had shut the front-door behind her;
"flatterers know how to make themselves welcome, and to gather up the
crumbs; but have patience, have patience; our god is a jealous god, and
one fine day he will be avenged upon them!" she would declaim, with the
sidelong, insinuating glance of joash, thinking of athaliah alone when
he says that the

but on this memorable afternoon, when the curé had come as well, and

by his interminable visit had drained my aunt's strength, françoise
followed eulalie from the room, saying: "mme. octave, i will leave you
to rest; you look utterly tired out."

and my aunt answered her not a word, breathing a sigh so faint that
it seemed it must prove her last, and lying there with closed eyes, as
though already dead. but hardly had françoise arrived downstairs, when
four peals of a bell, pulled with the utmost violence, reverberated
through the house, and my aunt, sitting erect upon her bed, called out:
"has eulalie gone yet? would you believe it; i forgot t

quick!"

but françoise returned alone, having failed to overtake eulalie. "it
is most provoking," said my aunt, shaking her head. "the one important
thing that i had to ask her."

in this way life went by for my aunt léonie, always the same, in the
gentle uniformity of what she called, with a pretence of deprecation
but with a deep tenderness, her 'little jog-trot.' respected by all
and sundry, not merely in her own house, where every one of us, having
learned the futility of recommending any healthier mode of life, had

oom, have heard these
mordant sarcasms levelled at herself, the mere framing of which in words
would not have relieved my aunt's feelings sufficiently, had they been
allowed to remain in a purely immaterial form, without the degree
of substance and reality which she added to them by murmuring them
half-aloud. sometimes, however, even these counterpane dramas would not
satisfy my aunt; she must see her work staged. and so, on a sunday,
with all the doors mysteriously closed, she would confide in eulalie her
doubts of françoise's integrity and her determination to be rid of her,
and on another day she would confide in françoise her suspicions of the
disloyalty of eulalie, to whom the front-door would very soon be closed
for good. a few days more, and, disgusted with her latest confidant, she
would again be 'as thick as thieves' with the traitor, while, before the
next performance, the two would once more have changed their parts. but
the suspicions which eulalie might occasionally breed in he

r were no
more than a fire of straw, which must soon subside for lack of fuel,
since eulalie was not living with her in the house. it was a very
different matter when the suspect was françoise, of whose presence under
the same roof as herself my aunt was perpetually conscious, while for
fear of catching cold, were she to leave her bed, she would never dare
go downstairs to the kitchen to see for herself whether there was,
indeed, any foundation for her suspicions. and so on by degrees, until
her mind had no other occupation than to attempt, at every hour of the
day, to discover what w

as being done, what was being concealed from her
by françoise. she would detect the most furtive movement of françoise's
features, something contradictory in what she was saying, some desire
which she appeared to be screening. and she would shew her that she was
unmasked, by, a single word, which made françoise turn pale, and which
my aunt seemed to find a cruel satisfaction in driving into her unhappy
servant's heart. and the very next sunday a disclosure by eulalie--like
one of those discoveries which suddenly open up an unsuspected field
for exploration to some new science which has hitherto followed only
the beaten paths--proved to my aunt that her own worst suspicions fell
a long way short of the appalling truth. "but françoise ought to know
that," said eulalie, "now that you have given her a carriage."

"now that i have given her a carriage!" gasped my aunt.

"oh, but i didn't know; i only thought so; i saw her go by yesterday in
her open coach, as p

versailles; and was able, too, to persuade herself that her silence,
a shade of good humour or of arrogance on her features, would provide
françoise with matter for a mental commentary as tense with passion and
terror, as did the silence, the good humour or the arrogance of the king
when a courtier, or even his greatest nobles, had presented a petition
to him, at the turning of an avenue, at versailles.

one sunday, when my aunt had received simultaneous visits from the curé
and from eulalie, and had been left alone, afterwards, to rest, the
whole family went upstairs to bid her good night, and mamma ventured
to condole with her on the unlucky coincidence that always brought both
visitors to her door at the same time.

"i hear that things went wrong again to-day, léonie," she said kindly,
"you have had all your friends here at once."

and my great-aunt interrupted with: "too many good things..." for, since
her daughter's illness, she felt herself in duty bound to revive her as
