Samuel Norton - 
                One of the prison wardens. Norton institutes the new "Inside-Out" program that forces prisoners to work on chain gains to repair roads and public buildings. Even though he claims to be a devout Baptist, he accepts bribes from local construction companies so that the Inside-Out program won't put them out of business. He uses Andy's financial expertise to hide his illegal earnings and therefore refuses to help Andy win a retrial. Norton eventually resigns in disgrace after Andy's escape.
