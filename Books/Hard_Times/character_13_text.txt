the one thing needful


â€˜now, what i want is, facts.  teach these boys and girls nothing but
facts.  facts alone are wanted in life.  plant nothing else, and root out
everything else.  you can only form the minds of reasoning animals upon
facts: nothing else will ever be of any service to them.  this is the

the speaker, and the schoolmaster, and the third grown person present,
all backed a little, and swept with their eyes the inclined plane of
little vessels then and there arranged in order, ready to have imperial
gallons of facts poured into them until they were full to the brim.



chapter ii
murdering the innocents


thomas gradgrind, sir.  a man of realities.  a man of facts and
calculations.  a man who proceeds upon the principle that two and two are
four, and nothing over, and who is not to be talked into allowing for
anything over.  thomas gradgrind, sirâ€”peremptorily thomasâ€”thomas
gradgrind.  with a rule and a pair of scales, and the multiplication
table always in his pocket, sir, ready to weigh and measure any parcel of
human nature, and tell you exactly what it comes to.  it is a mere
question of figures, a case o

f simple arithmetic.  you might hope to get
some other nonsensical belief into the head of george gradgrind, or
augustus gradgrind, or john gradgrind, or joseph gradgrind (all
supposititious, non-existent persons), but into the head of thomas
gradgrindâ€”no, sir!

in such terms mr. gradgrind always mentally introduced himself, whether
to his private circle of acquaintance, or to the public in general.  in
such terms, no doubt, substituting the words â€˜boys and girls,â€™ for â€˜sir,â€™
thomas gradgrind now presented thomas gradgrind to the little pitchers
before him, who were to be filled so full of facts.

indeed, as he eagerly sparkled at them from the cellarage before
mentioned, he seemed a kind of cannon loaded to the muzzle with facts,
and prepared to blow them clean out of the regions of childhood at one
discharge.  he seemed a galvanizing apparatus, too, charged with a grim
mechanical substitute for the tender young imaginations that were to be
stormed away.

â€˜girl number twenty,â€™

said mr. gradgrind, squarely pointing with his
square forefinger, â€˜i donâ€™t know that girl.  who is that girl?â€™

â€˜sissy jupe, sir,â€™ explained number twenty, blushing, standing up, and
curtseying.

â€˜sissy is not a name,â€™ said mr. gradgrind.  â€˜donâ€™t call yourself sissy.
call yourself cecilia.â€™

â€˜itâ€™s father as calls me sissy, sir,â€™ returned the young girl in a
trembling voice, and with another curtsey.

â€˜then he has no business to do it,â€™ said mr. gradgrind.  â€˜tell him he
mustnâ€™t.  cecilia jupe.  let me see.  what is your father?â€™

â€˜he belongs to the horse-riding, if you please, sir.â€™

mr. gradgrind frowned, and waved off the objectionable calling with his
hand.

â€˜we donâ€™t want to know anything about that, here.  you mustnâ€™t tell us
about that, here.  your father breaks horses, donâ€™t he?â€™

â€˜if you please, sir, when they can get any to break, they do break horses
in the ring, sir.â€™

â€˜you mustnâ€™t tell us about the ring, h

â€˜oh yes, sir.â€™

â€˜very well, then.  he is a veterinary surgeon, a farrier, and
horsebreaker.  give me your definition of a horse.â€™

(sissy jupe thrown into the greatest alarm by this demand.)

the general behoof of all the little pitchers.  â€˜girl number twenty
possessed of no facts, in reference to one of the commonest of animals!
some boyâ€™s definition of a horse.  bitzer, yours.â€™

the square finger, moving here and there, lighted suddenly on bitzer,
perhaps because he chanced to sit in the same ray of sunlight which,
darting in at one of the bare windows of the intensely white-washed room,
irradiated sissy.  for, the boys and girls sat on the face of the

his cold eyes would hardly have been eyes, but for the short ends of
lashes which, by bringing them into immediate contrast with something
paler than themselves, expressed their form.  his short-cropped hair
might have been a mere continuation of the sandy freckles on his forehead
and face.  his skin was so unwholesomely deficient in the natural tinge,
that he looked as though, if he were cut, he would bleed white.

â€˜bitzer,â€™ said thomas gradgrind.  â€˜your definition of a horse.â€™

â€˜quadruped.  graminivorous.  forty teeth, namely twenty-four grinders,
four eye-teeth, and twelve incisive.  sheds coat in the spring; in marshy
countries, sheds hoofs, too.  hoofs hard, but requiring to be shod with
iron.  age known by marks in mouth.â€™  thus (and much more) bitzer.

â€˜now girl number twenty,â€™ said mr. gradgrind.  â€˜you know what a horse
is.â€™

she curtseyed again, and would have blushed deeper, if she could have
blushed deeper than

blinking at thomas gradgrind with both eyes at once, and so catching the
light upon his quivering ends of lashes that they looked like the antennÃ¦

again.

the third gentleman now stepped forth.  a mighty man at cutting and
drying, he was; a government officer; in his way (and in most other
peopleâ€™s too), a professed pugilist; always in training, always with a
system to force down the general throat like a bolus, always to be heard
of at the bar of

upon which the other half, seeing in the gentlemanâ€™s face that yes was
wrong, cried out in chorus, â€˜no, sir!â€™â€”as the custom is, in these
examinations.

â€˜of course, no.  why wouldnâ€™t you?â€™

a pause.  one corpulent slow boy, with a wheezy manner of breathing,
ventured the answer, because he wouldnâ€™t paper a room at all, but would
paint it.

â€˜you _must_ paper it,â€™ said the gentleman, rather warmly.

â€˜you must paper it,â€™ said thomas gradgrind, â€˜whether you like it or not.
donâ€™t tell _us_ you wouldnâ€™t paper it.  what do you mean, boy?â€™

â€˜iâ€™ll explain to you, then,â€™ said the gentleman, after another and a
dismal pause, â€˜why you wouldnâ€™t paper a room with representations of
horses.  do you ever see horses walking up and down the sides of rooms in
realityâ€”in fact?  do you?â€™

â€˜yes, sir!â€™ from one half.  â€˜no, sir!â€™ from the other.

â€˜of course no,â€™ said the gentleman, with an indignant look at the wrong

his approbation.

â€˜this is a new principle, a discovery, a great discovery,â€™ said the
gentleman.  â€˜now, iâ€™ll try you again.  suppose you were going to carpet a
room.  would you use a carpet having a representation of flowers upon
it?â€™

there being a general conviction by this time that â€˜no, sir!â€™ was always
the right answer to this gentleman, the chorus of no was very strong.
only a few feeble stragglers said yes: among them sissy jupe.

pleasant, and i would fancyâ€”â€™

â€˜ay, ay, ay!  but you mustnâ€™t fancy,â€™ cried the gentleman, quite elated
by coming so happily to his point.  â€˜thatâ€™s it!  you are never to fancy.â€™

â€˜you are not, cecilia jupe,â€™ thomas gradgrind solemnly repeated, â€˜to do
anything of that kind.â€™

â€˜fact, fact, fact!â€™ said the gentleman.  and â€˜fact, fact, fact!â€™ repeated
thomas gradgrind.

â€˜you are to be in all things regulated and governed,â€™ said the gentleman,
â€˜by fact.  we hope to have, before long, a board of fact, composed of
commissioners of fact, who will force the people to be a people of fact,
and of nothing but fact.  you must discard the word fancy altogether.

the girl curtseyed, and sat down.  she was very young, and she looked as
if she were frightened by the matter-of-fact prospect the world afforded.

â€˜now, if mr. mâ€™choakumchild,â€™ said the gentleman, â€˜will proceed to give
his first lesson here, mr. gradgrind, i shall be happy, at your request,
to observe his mode of procedure.â€™

mr. gradgrind was much obliged.  â€˜mr. mâ€™choakumchild, we only wait for
you.â€™

so, mr. mâ€™choakumchild began in his best manner.  he and some one hundred
and forty other schoolmasters, had been lately turned at the same time,
in the same factory, on the same principles, like so many pianoforte
legs.  he had been put through an immense variety of paces, and had
answered volumes of head-breaking questions.  orthograph

he went to work in this preparatory lesson, not unlike morgiana in the
forty thieves: looking into all the vessels ranged before him, one after
another, to see what they contained.  say, good mâ€™choakumchild.  when
from thy boiling store, thou shalt fill each jar brim full by-and-by,
dost thou think that thou wilt always kill outright the robber fancy
lurking withinâ€”or sometimes only maim him and distort him!



chapter iii
a loophole


mr. gradgrind walked homeward from the school, in a state of considerable
satisfaction.  it was his school, and he intended it to be a model.  he
intended every child in it to be a modelâ€”just as the young gradgrinds
were all models.

there were five young gradgrinds, and they were models every one.  they
had been lectured at, from their tenderest years; coursed, like little
hares.  almost as soon as they could run alone, they had been made to run
to the lecture-room.  the first object with which they had a

n
association, or of which they had a remembrance, was a large black board
with a dry ogre chalking ghastly white figures on it.

not that they knew, by name or nature, anything about an ogre fact
forbid!  i only use the word to express a monster in a lecturing castle,
with heaven knows how many heads manipulated into one, taking childhood
captive, and dragging it into gloomy statistical dens by the hair.

no little gradgrind had ever seen a face in the moon; it was up in the
moon before it could speak distinctly.  no little gradgrind had ever
learnt the silly jingle, twinkle, twinkle, little star; how i wonder what
you are!  no little gradgrind had ever known wonder on the subject, each
little gradgrind having at five years old dissected the great bear like a
professor owen, and driven charlesâ€™s wain like a locomotive
engine-driver.  no little gradgrind had ever associated a cow in a field
with that famous cow wi

th the crumpled horn who tossed the dog who
worried the cat who killed the rat who ate the malt, or with that yet
more famous cow who swallowed tom thumb: it had never heard of those
celebrities, and had only been introduced to a cow as a graminivorous
ruminating quadruped with several stomachs.

to his matter-of-fact home, which was called stone lodge, mr. gradgrind
directed his steps.  he had virtually retired from the wholesale hardware
trade before he built stone lodge, and was now looking about for a
suitable opportunity of making an arithmetical figure in parliament.
stone lodge was situated on a moor within a mile or two of a great
townâ€”called coketown in the present faithful guide-book.

a very regular feature on the face of the country, stone lodge was.  not
the least disguise toned down or shaded off that uncompromising fact in
the landscape.  a

fire-proof from top to bottom; mechanical lifts for the housemaids, with
all their brushes and brooms; everything that heart could desire.

everything?  well, i suppose so.  the little gradgrinds had cabinets in
various departments of science too.  they had a little conchological
cabinet, and a little metallurgical cabinet, and a little mineralogical
cabinet; and the specimens were all arranged and labelled, and the bits
of stone and ore looked as though they might have been broken from the
parent substances by those tremendously hard instruments their own names;
and, to paraphrase the idle legend of peter piper, who had never found
his way into their nursery, if the greedy little grad

their father walked on in a hopeful and satisfied frame of mind.  he was
an affectionate father, after his manner; but he would probably have
described himself (if he had been put, like sissy jupe, upon a
definition) as â€˜an eminently practicalâ€™ father.  he had a particular
pride in the phrase eminently practical, which was considered to have a
special application to him.  whatsoever the public meeting held in

rapturous plaudits from enthusiastic throngs it cannot be withdrawn.â€™
the same signor jupe was to â€˜enliven the varied performances at frequent
intervals with his chaste shaksperean quips and retorts.â€™  lastly, he was
to wind them up by appearing in his favourite character of mr. william
button, of tooley street, in â€˜the highly novel and laughable
hippo-comedietta of the tailorâ€™s journey to brentford.â€™

thomas gradgrind took no heed of these trivialities of course, but passed
on as a practical man ought to pass on, either brushing the noisy insects
from his thoughts, or consigning them to the house of correction.  but,
the turning of the road took him by the back of the booth, and at the
back of the booth a number of children were congregated in a number of
stealthy attitudes, striving to peep in at the hidden glories of the
place.

this brought him to a stop.  â€˜now, to think of these vagabonds,â€™ said he,

f stunted grass and dry rubbish being between him and the young
rabble, he took his eyeglass out of his waistcoat to look for any child

though distinctly seen, what did he then behold but his own metallurgical
louisa, peeping with all her might through a hole in a deal board, and
his own mathematical thomas abasing himself on the ground to catch but a
hoof of the graceful equestrian tyrolean flower-act!

dumb with amazement, mr. gradgrind crossed to the spot where his family
was thus disgraced, laid his hand upon each erring child, and said:

â€˜louisa!!  thomas!!â€™

both rose, red and disconcerted.  but, louisa looked at her father with
more boldness than thomas did.  indeed, thomas did not look at him, but
gave himself up to be taken home like a machine.

â€˜in the name of wonder, idleness, and folly!â€™ said mr. gradgrind, leading
each away by a hand; â€˜what do you do here?â€™

â€˜i am sorry to hear it.  i am very sorry indeed to hear it.  it makes
thomas no better, and it makes you worse, louisa.â€™

she looked at her father again, but no tear fell down her cheek.

â€˜you!  thomas and you, to whom the circle of the sciences is open; thomas
and you, who may be said to be replete with facts; thomas and you, who
have been trained to mathematical exactness; thomas and you, here!â€™ cried
mr. gradgrind.  â€˜in this degraded position!  i am amazed.â€™

â€˜i was tired, father.  i have been tired a long time,â€™ said louisa.

â€˜tired?  of what?â€™ asked the astonished father.

â€˜i donâ€™t know of whatâ€”of everything, i think.â€™

â€˜say not another word,â€™ returned mr. gradgrind.  â€˜you are childish.  i
will hear no more.â€™  he did not speak again until they had walked some
half-a-mile in silence, when he gravely broke out with: â€˜what would your
best friends say, louisa?  do you attach n

he saw nothing of it, for before he looked at her, she had again cast
down her eyes!

â€˜what,â€™ he repeated presently, â€˜would mr. bounderby say?â€™  all the way to
stone lodge, as with grave indignation he led the two delinquents home,
he repeated at intervals â€˜what would mr. bounderby say?â€™â€”as if mr.
bounderby had been mrs. grundy.



chapter iv
mr. bounderby


not being mrs. grundy, who _was_ mr. bounderby?

why, mr. bounderby was as near being mr. gradgrindâ€™s bosom friend, as a
man perfectly devoid of sentiment can approach that spiritual
relationship towards another man perfectly devoid of sentiment.  so near
was mr. bounderbyâ€”or, if the reader should prefer it, so far off.

he was a rich man: banker, merchant, manufacturer, and what not.  a big,
loud man, with a stare, and a metallic laugh.  a man made out of a coarse
material, which seemed to have been stretched to make so much of him.  a
man with a great puffed head and forehead, swelled v

looked older; his seven or eight and forty might have had the seven or
eight added to it again, without surprising anybody.  he had not much
hair.  one might have fancied he had talked it off; and that what was
left, all standing up in disorder, was in that condition from being
constantly blown about by his windy boastfulness.

in the formal drawing-room of stone lodge, standing on the hearthrug,
warming himself before the fire, mr. bounderby delivered some
observations to mrs. gradgrind on the circumstance of its being his
birthday.  he stood before the fire, partly because it was a cool spring
afternoon, though the sun shone; partly because the shade of stone lodge
was always haunted by the ghost of damp mortar; partly because he thus
took up a commanding position, from which to subdue mrs. gradgrind.

â€˜i hadnâ€™t a shoe to my foot.  as to a stocking, i didnâ€™t know such a
thing by name.  i passed the day in a ditch, and the night in a pigsty.
thatâ€™s the way i spent my t

enth birthday.  not that a ditch was new to
me, for i was born in a ditch.â€™

mrs. gradgrind, a little, thin, white, pink-eyed bundle of shawls, of
surpassing feebleness, mental and bodily; who was always taking physic
without any effect, and who, whenever she showed a symptom of coming to
life, was invariably stunned by some weighty piece of fact tumbling on
her; mrs. gradgrind hoped it was a dry ditch?

â€˜no!  as wet as a sop.  a foot of water in it,â€™ said mr. bounderby.

â€˜enough to give a baby cold,â€™ mrs. gradgrind considered.

â€˜cold?  i was born with inflammation of the lungs, and of everything
else, i believe, that was capable of inflammation,â€™ returned mr.
bounderby.  â€˜for years, maâ€™am, i was one of the most miserable little
wretches ever seen.  i was so sickly, that i was always moaning and
groaning.  i was so ragged and dirty, that you wouldnâ€™t

 have touched me
with a pair of tongs.â€™

mrs. gradgrind faintly looked at the tongs, as the most appropriate thing
her imbecility could think of doing.

â€˜how i fought through it, _i_ donâ€™t know,â€™ said bounderby.  â€˜i was
determined, i suppose.  i have been a determined character in later life,
and i suppose i was then.  here i am, mrs. gradgrind, anyhow, and nobody
to thank for my being here, but myself.â€™

mrs. gradgrind meekly and weakly hoped that his motherâ€”

â€˜_my_ mother?  bolted, maâ€™am!â€™ said bounderby.

mrs. gradgrind, stunned as usual, collapsed and gave it up.

â€˜my mother left me to my grandmother,â€™ said bounderby; â€˜and, according to
the best of my remembrance, my grandmother was the wickedest and the
worst old woman that ever lived.  if i got a little pair of shoes by any
chance, she would take â€™em off and sell â€™em for drink.  why, i have known
that grandmother of mine lie in her bed

and drink her four-teen glasses
of liquor before breakfast!â€™

mrs. gradgrind, weakly smiling, and giving no other sign of vitality,
looked (as she always did) like an indifferently executed transparency of
a small female figure, without enough light behind it.

â€˜she kept a chandlerâ€™s shop,â€™ pursued bounderby, â€˜and kept me in an
egg-box.  that was the cot of _my_ infancy; an old egg-box.  as soon as i
was big enough to run away, of course i ran away.  then i became a young
vagabond; and instead of one old woman knocking me about and starving me,

they had no business to do anything else.  i was a nuisance, an
incumbrance, and a pest.  i know that very well.â€™

his pride in having at any time of his life achieved such a great social
distinction as to be a nuisance, an incumbrance, and a pest, was only to
be satisfied by three sonorous repetitions of the boast.

â€˜i was to pull through it, i suppose, mrs. gradgrind.  whether i was to
do it or not, maâ€™am, i did it.  i pulled through it, though nobody threw
me out a rope.  vagabond, errand-boy, vagabond, labourer, porter, clerk,

the antecedents, and the culmination.  josiah bounderby of coketown

accompanied by the two young culprits, entered the room.  his eminently
practical friend, on seeing him, stopped also, and gave louisa a
reproachful look that plainly said, â€˜behold your bounderby!â€™

â€˜well!â€™ blustered mr. bounderby, â€˜whatâ€™s the matter?  what is young
thomas in the dumps about?â€™

he spoke of young thomas, but he looked at louisa.

â€˜we were peeping at the circus,â€™ muttered louisa, haughtily, without
lifting up her eyes, â€˜and father caught us.â€™

â€˜and, mrs. gradgrind,â€™ said her husband in a lofty manner, â€˜i should as
soon have expected to find my children reading poetry.â€™

â€˜dear me,â€™ whimpered mrs. gradgrind.  â€˜how can you, louisa and thomas!  i
wonder at you.  i declare youâ€™re enough to make one regret ever having
had a family at all.  i have a great mind to say i wish i hadnâ€™t.  _then_
what would you have done, i should like to know?â€™

mr. gradgrind did not seem favourably impressed by these cogent remarks.
he frowned impatiently.

lectures about circuses.  what can you possibly want to know of circuses
then?  i am sure you have enough to do, if thatâ€™s what you want.  with my
head in its present state, i couldnâ€™t remember the mere names of half the
facts you have got to attend to.â€™

â€˜thatâ€™s the reason!â€™ pouted louisa.

â€˜donâ€™t tell me thatâ€™s the reason, because it canâ€™t be nothing of the
sort,â€™

 said mrs. gradgrind.  â€˜go and be somethingological directly.â€™
mrs. gradgrind was not a scientific character, and usually dismissed her
children to their studies with this general injunction to choose their
pursuit.

in truth, mrs. gradgrindâ€™s stock of facts in general was woefully
defective; but mr. gradgrind in raising her to her high matrimonial
position, had been influenced by two reasons.  firstly, she was most
satisfactory as a question of figures; and, secondly, she had â€˜no
nonsenseâ€™ about her.  by nonsense he meant fancy; and truly it is
probable she was as free from any alloy of that nature, as any human
being not arrived at the perfection of an absolute idiot, ever was.

the simple circumstance of being left alone with her husband and mr.
bounderby, was sufficient to stun this admirable

 lady again without
collision between herself and any other fact.  so, she once more died
away, and nobody minded her.

â€˜bounderby,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, drawing a chair to the fireside, â€˜you
are always so interested in my young peopleâ€”particularly in louisaâ€”that i
make no apology for saying to you, i am very much vexed by this
discovery.  i have systematically devoted myself (as you know) to the
education of the reason of my family.  the reason is (as you know) the
only faculty to which education should be addressed.  â€˜and yet,
bounderby, it would appear from this unexpected circumstance of to-day,
though in itself a trifling one, as i

th interest at a parcel of
vagabonds,â€™ returned bounderby.  â€˜when i was a vagabond myself, nobody
looked with any interest at _me_; i know that.â€™

â€˜then comes the question; said the eminently practical father, with his
eyes on the fire, â€˜in what has this vulgar curiosity its rise?â€™

â€˜iâ€™ll tell you in what.  in idle imagination.â€™

â€˜i hope not,â€™ said the eminently practical; â€˜i confess, however, that the
misgiving _has_ crossed me on my way home.â€™

â€˜in idle imagination, gradgrind,â€™ repeated bounderby.  â€˜a very bad thing
for anybody, but a cursed bad thing for a girl like louisa.  i should ask
mrs. gradgrindâ€™s pardon for strong expressions, but that she knows very
well i am not a refined character.  whoever expects refinement in _me_
will be disappointed.  i hadnâ€™t a refined bringing up.â€™

â€˜whether,â€™ said gradgrind, pondering with his hands in his pockets, and
his cavernous eyes on the fire, â€˜whether any instructor or servant can
have suggested anything?

  whether, in spite of all precautions, any idle story-book can
have got into the house?  because, in minds that have been practically
formed by rule and line, from the cradle upwards, this is so curious, so
incomprehensible.â€™

â€˜stop a bit!â€™ cried bounderby, who all this time had been standing, as
before, on the hearth, bursting at the very furniture of the room with
explosive humility.  â€˜you have one of those strollersâ€™ children in the
school.â€™

â€˜cecilia jupe, by name,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, with something of a stricken
look at his friend.

â€˜now, stop a bit!â€™ cried bounderby again.  â€˜how did she come there?â€™

â€˜why, the fact is, i saw the girl myself, for the first time, only just
now.  she specially applied here at the house to be admitted, as not
regularly belonging to our town, andâ€”yes, you are right, bounderby, you
are right.â€™

â€˜now, stop a bit!â€™ cried bounderby, once more.  â€˜louisa saw her when she
came?â€™

â€˜louisa certainly did see her, for she mentione

but louisa saw her, i have no doubt, in mrs. gradgrindâ€™s presence.â€™

â€˜pray, mrs. gradgrind,â€™ said bounderby, â€˜what passed?â€™

â€˜oh, my poor health!â€™ returned mrs. gradgrind.  â€˜the girl wanted to come
to the school, and mr. gradgrind wanted girls to come to the school, and
louisa and thomas both said that the girl wanted to come, and that mr.
gradgrind wanted girls to come, and how was it possible to contradict
them when such was the fact!â€™

â€˜now i tell you what, gradgrind!â€™ said mr. bounderby.  â€˜turn this girl to
the right about, and thereâ€™s an end of it.â€™

â€˜i am much of your opinion.â€™

so, mr. bounderby threw on his hatâ€”he always threw it on, as expressing a
man who had been far too busily employed in making himself, to acquire
any fashion of wearing his hatâ€”and with his hands in his pockets,
sauntered out into the hall.  â€˜i never wear gloves,â€™ it was his custom to
say.  â€˜i didnâ€™t climb up the ladder in _them_.â€”shouldnâ€™t be so high up,
if i had.â€™

being left to saunter in the hall a minute or two while mr. gradgrind
went up-stairs for the address, he opened the door of the childrenâ€™s
study and looked into that serene floor-clothed apartment, which,
notwithstanding its book-cases and its cabinets and its variety of
learned and philosophical appliances, had much of the genial aspect of a
room devoted to hair-cutting.  louisa languidly leaned upon the window
looking out, without looking at anything, while young thomas stood

doing this, five minutes afterwards.

chapter v
the keynote


coketown, to which messrs. bounderby and gradgrind now walked, was a
triumph of fact; it had no greater taint of fancy in it than mrs.
gradgrind herself.  let us strike the key-note, coketown, before pursuing
our tune.

it was a town of red brick, or of brick that would have been red if the
smoke and ashes had allowed it; but as matters stood, it was a town of
unnatural red and black like the painted face of a savage.  it was a town
of machinery and tall chimneys, out of which interminable serpents of
smoke trailed themselves for ever and ever,

ious tabular statements, and showing
that the same people _would_ resort to low haunts, hidden from the public
eye, where they heard low singing and saw low dancing, and mayhap joined
in it; and where a. b., aged twenty-four next birthday, and committed for
eighteen monthsâ€™ solitary, had himself said (not that he had ever shown
himself particularly worthy of belief) his ruin began, as he was
perfectly sure and confident that otherwise he would have been a tip-top
moral specimen.  then came mr. gradgrind and mr. bounderby, the two
gentlemen at this present moment walking through coketown, and both
eminently practical, who could, on occasion, furnish more tabular
statements derived from their own personal experience, and illustrated by
cases they had known and seen, from which it clearly appearedâ€”in short,
it was the only clear thing in the caseâ€”that these same people were a bad
lot altogether, gentlemen; that do what you would for them they were
never thankful for it, gentlemen; that they w

isted on mocha coffee, and rejected all but
prime parts of meat, and yet were eternally dissatisfied and
unmanageable.  in short, it was the moral of the old nursery fable:

    there was an old woman, and what do you think?
    she lived upon nothing but victuals and drink;
    victuals and drink were the whole of her diet,
    and yet this old woman would never be quiet.

is it possible, i wonder, that there was any analogy between the case of
the coketown population and the case of the little gradgrinds?  surely,
none of us in our sober senses and acquainted with figures, are to be
told at this time of day, that one of the foremost elements in the
existence of the coketown working-people had been for scores of years,
deliberately set at nought?  that there was any fancy in them demanding
to be brought into healthy existence instead of struggling on in
convulsions?  that exactly in the ratio as they worked long and
monotonously, the craving grew within them for some physical reliefâ€”some

aright, or must and would inevitably go wrong, until the laws of the
creation were repealed?

â€˜this man lives at podâ€™s end, and i donâ€™t quite know podâ€™s end,â€™ said mr.
gradgrind.  â€˜which is it, bounderby?â€™

mr. bounderby knew it was somewhere down town, but knew no more
respecting it.  so they stopped for a moment, looking about.

almost as they did so, there came running round the corner of the street
at a quick pace and with a frightened look, a girl whom mr. gradgrind
recognized.  â€˜halloa!â€™ said he.  â€˜stop!  where are you going! stop!â€™
girl number twenty stopped then, palpitating, and made him a curtsey.

â€˜why are you tearing about the streets,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, â€˜in this
improper manner?â€™

â€˜i wasâ€”i was run after, sir,â€™ the girl panted, â€˜and i wanted to get
away.â€™

â€˜run after?â€™ repeated mr. gradgrind.  â€˜who would run after _you_?â€™

the question was unexpectedly and suddenly answered for her, by the
colourless boy, bitzer,

who came round the corner with such blind speed
and so little anticipating a stoppage on the pavement, that he brought
himself up against mr. gradgrindâ€™s waistcoat and rebounded into the road.

â€˜what do you mean, boy?â€™ said mr. gradgrind.  â€˜what are you doing?  how
dare you dash againstâ€”everybodyâ€”in this manner?â€™  bitzer picked up his
cap, which the concussion had knocked off; and backing, and knuckling his
forehead, pleaded that it was an accident.

â€˜was this boy running after you, jupe?â€™ asked mr. gradgrind.

â€˜yes, sir,â€™ said the girl reluctantly.

â€˜no, i wasnâ€™t, sir!â€™ cried bitzer.  â€˜not till she run away from me.  but
the horse-riders never mind what they say, sir; theyâ€™re famous for it.

by.  â€˜youâ€™d have had the whole school peeping in a row, in a

â€˜truly, i think so,â€™ returned his friend.  â€˜bitzer, turn you about and
take yourself home. jupe, stay here a moment.  let me hear of your
running in this manner any more, boy, and you will hear of me through the
master of the school.  you understand what i mean.  go along.â€™

the boy stopped in his rapid blinking, knuckled his forehead again,
glanced at sissy, turned about, and retreated.

â€˜now, girl,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, â€˜take this gentleman and me to your
fatherâ€™s; we are going there.  what have you got in that bottle you are
carrying?â€™

â€˜gin,â€™ said mr. bounderby.

â€˜dear, no, sir!  itâ€™s the nine oils.â€™

â€˜the what?â€™ cried mr. bounderby.

â€˜the nine oils, sir, to rub father with.â€™

â€˜then,â€™ said mr. bounderby, with a loud short laugh, â€˜what the devil do
you rub your father with nine oils for?â€™

â€˜itâ€™s what our people aways use, sir, when they get any hurts in the
ring,â€™ replie

â€˜serve â€™em right,â€™ said mr. bounderby, â€˜for being idle.â€™  she glanced up
at his face, with mingled astonishment and dread.

â€˜by george!â€™ said mr. bounderby, â€˜when i was four or five years younger
than you, i had worse bruises upon me than ten oils, twenty oils, forty
oils, would have rubbed off.  i didnâ€™t get â€™em by posture-making, but by
being banged about.  there was no rope-dancing for me; i danced on the
bare ground and was larruped with the rope.â€™

mr. gradgrind, though hard enough, was by no means so rough a man as mr.
bounderby.  his character was not unkind, all things considered; it might
have been a very kind one indeed, if he had only made some round mistake
in the arithmetic that balanced it, years ago.  he said, in what he meant
for a reassuring tone, as they turned down a narrow road, â€˜and this is
podâ€™s end; is it, jupe?â€™

â€˜this is it, sir, andâ€”if you wouldnâ€™t mind, sirâ€”this is the house.â€™

she stopped, at twilight, at the door

pegasusâ€”a theatrical oneâ€”with real gauze let in for his wings, golden
stars stuck on all over him, and his ethereal harness made of red silk.

as it had grown too dusky without, to see the sign, and as it had not
grown light enough within to see the picture, mr. gradgrind and mr.
bounderby received no offence from these idealities.  they followed the
girl up some steep corner-stairs without meeting any one, and stopped in
the dark while she went on for a candle.  they expected every moment to
hear merrylegs give tongue, but the highly trained performing dog had not
barked when the girl and the candle appeared together.

â€˜father is not in our room, sir,â€™ she said, with a face of great
surprise.  â€˜if you wouldnâ€™t mind walking in, iâ€™ll find him directly.â

voices expressing surprise.  she came bounding down again in a great
hurry, opened a battered and mangy old hair trunk, found it empty, and
looked round with her hands clasped and her face full of terror.

â€˜father must have gone down to the booth, sir.  i donâ€™t know why he
should go there, but he must be there; iâ€™ll bring him in a minute!â€™  she
was gone directly, without her bonnet; with her long, dark, childish hair
streaming behind her.

â€˜what does she mean!â€™ said mr. gradgrind.  â€˜back in a minute?  itâ€™s more
than a mile off.â€™

before mr. bounderby could reply, a young man appeared at the door, and
introducing himself with the words, â€˜by your leaves, gentlemen!â€™ walked
in with his hands in his pockets.  his face, close-shaven, thin, and
sallow, was shaded by a great quantity of dark hair, brushed into a roll
all round his head, and parted up the centre.  his legs were very robust,
but shorter than legs of good proportions should have been.  his chest

pleasing a cupid as to constitute the chief delight of the maternal part
of the spectators; but in private, where his characteristics were a
precocious cutaway coat and an extremely gruff voice, he became of the
turf, turfy.

â€˜by your leaves, gentlemen,â€™ said mr. e. w. b. childers, glancing round
the room.  â€˜it was you, i believe, that were wishing to see jupe!â€™

â€˜it was,â€™ said mr. gradgrind.  â€˜his daughter has gone to fetch him, but i
canâ€™t wait; therefore, if you please, i will leave a message for him with
you.â€™

â€˜you see, my friend,â€™ mr. bounderby put in, â€˜we are the kind of people
who know the value of time, and you are the kind of people who donâ€™t know
the value of time.â€™

â€˜kidderminster, stow that!â€™ said mr. childers.  (master kidderminster was
cupidâ€™s mortal name.)

â€˜what does he come here cheeking us for, then?â€™ cried master
kidderminster, showing a very irascible temperament.  â€˜if you want to
cheek us, pay your ochre at the doors and take it out.â€™

â€˜kidderminster,â€™ said mr. childers, raising his voice, â€˜stow that!â€”sir,â€™
to mr. gradgrind, â€˜i was addressing myself to you.  you may or you may
not be aware (for perhaps you have not been much in the audience), that
jupe has missed his tip very often, lately.â€™

â€˜hasâ€”what has he missed?â€™ asked mr. gradgrind, glancing at the potent
bounderby for assistance.

â€˜missed his tip.â€™

â€˜offered at the garters four times last night, and never done â€™em once,â€™
said master kidderminster.  â€˜missed his tip at the banners, too, and was

â€˜in a general way thatâ€™s missing his tip,â€™ mr. e. w. b. childers
answered.

â€˜nine oils, merrylegs, missing tips, garters, banners, and ponging, eh!â€™
ejaculated bounderby, with his laugh of laughs.  â€˜queer sort of company,
too, for a man who has raised himself!â€™

â€˜lower yourself, then,â€™ retorted cupid.  â€˜oh lord! if youâ€™ve raised

â€˜weâ€™d have had a young gentleman to meet you, if we had known you were

you donâ€™t have a bespeak, being so particular.  youâ€™re on the tight-jeff,
ainâ€™t you?â€™

â€˜what does this unmannerly boy mean,â€™ asked mr. gradgrind, eyeing him in
a sort of desperation, â€˜by tight-jeff?â€™

â€˜there!  get out, get out!â€™ said mr. childers, thrusting his young friend
from the room, rather in the prairie manner.  â€˜tight-jeff or slack-jeff,
it donâ€™t much signify: itâ€™s only tight-rope and slack-rope.  you were
going to give me a message for jupe?â€™

â€˜yes, i was.â€™

â€˜then,â€™ continued mr. childers, quickly, â€˜my opinion is, he will never
receive it.  do you know much of him?â€™

â€˜i never saw the man in my life

.â€™

â€˜i doubt if you ever _will_ see him now.  itâ€™s pretty plain to me, heâ€™s
off.â€™

â€˜do you mean that he has deserted his daughter?â€™

â€˜ay!  i mean,â€™ said mr. childers, with a nod, â€˜that he has cut.  he was
goosed last night, he was goosed the night before last, he was goosed
to-day.  he has lately got in the way of being always goosed, and he
canâ€™t stand it.â€™

â€˜why has he beenâ€”so very muchâ€”goosed?â€™ asked mr. gradgrind, forcing the
word out of himself, with great solemnity and reluctance.

â€˜his joints are turning stiff, and he is getting used up,â€™ said childers.
â€˜he has his points as a cackler still, but he canâ€™t get a living out of
_them_.â€™

â€˜a cackler!â€™ bounderby repeated.  â€˜here we go again!â€™

â€˜a speaker, if the gentleman likes it better,â€™ said mr. e. w. b.
childers, superciliously throwing the interpretation over his shoulder,
and accompanying it with a shake of his long hairâ€”which
 
 ___________________________
 
 all shook at
once.  â€˜now, itâ€™s a remarkable fact, sir, that it cut that man deeper, to
know that his daughter knew of his being goosed, than to go through with
it.â€™

â€˜good!â€™ interrupted mr. bounderby.  â€˜this is good, gradgrind!  a man so
fond of his daughter, that he runs away from her!  this is devilish good!
ha! ha!  now, iâ€™ll tell you what, young man.  i havenâ€™t always occupied
my present station of life.  i know what these things are.  you may be
astonished to hear it, but my motherâ€”ran away from _me_.â€™

e. w. b. childers replied pointedly, that he was not at all astonished to
hear it.

â€˜very well,â€™ said bounderby.  â€˜i was born in a ditch, and my mother ran
away from me.  do i excuse her for it?  no

rn irony.  â€˜donâ€™t give it mouth in this building, till youâ€™re

â€˜perhaps so,â€™ replied mr. bounderby, rattling his money and laughing.

â€˜then give it mouth in your own building, will you, if you please?â€™ said
childers.  â€˜because this isnâ€™t a strong building, and too much of you
might bring it down!â€™

eyeing mr. bounderby from head to foot again, he turned from him, as from
a man finally disposed of, to mr. gradgrind.

â€˜jupe sent his daughter out on an errand not an hour ago, and then was
seen to slip out himself, with his hat over his eyes, and a bundle tied
up in a handkerchief under his arm.  she will never believe it of him,
but he has cut away and left her.â€™

â€˜pray,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, â€˜why will she never believe it of him?â€™

â€˜because those two were one.  because they were never asunder.  because,
up to this time, he seemed to dote upon her,â€™ said childers, taking a

men, and with a very knowing assumption of being
stiff in the knees.  this walk was common to all the male members of
slearyâ€™s company, and was understood to express, that they were always on
horseback.

â€˜poor sissy!  he had better have apprenticed her,â€™ said childers, giving
his hair another shake, as he looked up from the empty box.  â€˜now, he
leaves her without anything to take to.â€™

â€˜it is creditable to you, who have never been apprenticed, to express
that opinion,â€™ returned mr. gradgrind, approvingly.

â€˜_i_ never apprenticed?  i was apprenticed when i was seven year old.â€™

â€˜oh!  indeed?â€™ said mr. gradgrind, rather resentfully, as having been
defrauded of his good opinion.  â€˜i was not aware of its being the custom
to apprentice young persons toâ€”â€™

â€˜idleness,â€™ mr. bounderby put in with a loud laugh.  â€˜no, by the lord
harry!  nor i!â€™

â€˜her father always had it in his head,â€™ resumed childers, feigning
unconsciousness of mr. bounderbyâ€™s existence, â€˜that

 she was to be taught
the deuce-and-all of education.  how it got into his head, i canâ€™t say; i
can only say that it never got out.  he has been picking up a bit of
reading for her, hereâ€”and a bit of writing for her, thereâ€”and a bit of
ciphering for her, somewhere elseâ€”these seven years.â€™

mr. e. w. b. childers took one of his hands out of his pockets, stroked
his face and chin, and looked, with a good deal of doubt and a little
hope, at mr. gradgrind.  from the first he had sought to conciliate that
gentleman, for the sake of the deserted girl.

â€˜when sissy got into the school here,â€™ he pursued, â€˜her father was as
pleased as punch.  i couldnâ€™t altogether make out why, myself, as we were
not stationary here, being but comers and goers anywhere.  i suppose,
however, he had this move in his mindâ€”he was always half-crackedâ€”and then
considered her provided for.  if you should happen to have looked in
to-night, for the purpose of tell
 
 ___________________________
 
ing him that you were going to do her
any little service,â€™ said mr. childers, stroking his face again, and
repeating his look, â€˜it would be very fortunate and well-timed; very
fortunate and well-timed.â€™

â€˜on the contrary,â€™ returned mr. gradgrind.  â€˜i came to tell him that her
connections made her not an object for the school, and that she must not
attend any more.  still, if her father really has left her, without any
connivance on her partâ€”bounderby, let me have a word with you.â€™

upon this, mr. childers politely betook himself, with his equestrian
walk, to the landing outside the door, and there stood stroking his face,
and softly whistling.  while thus engaged, he overheard such phrases in
mr. bounderbyâ€™s voice as â€˜no.  _i

_ say no.  i advise you not.  i say by

the words, â€˜but even as an example to louisa, of what this pursuit which
has been the subject of a vulgar curiosity, leads to and ends in.  think
of it, bounderby, in that point of view.â€™

meanwhile, the various members of slearyâ€™s company gradually gathered
together from the upper regions, where they were quartered, and, from
standing about, talking in low voices to one another and to mr. childers,
gradually insinuated themselves and him into the room.  t

believe theyâ€™ll pith you out oâ€™ winder.â€™

mr. bounderby being restrained by this mild suggestion, mr. gradgrind
found an opening for his eminently practical exposition of the subject.

â€˜it is of no moment,â€™ said he, â€˜whether this person is to be expected
back at any time, or the contrary.  he is gone away, and there is no
present expectation of his return.  that, i believe, is agreed on all
hands.â€™

â€˜thath agreed, thquire.  thick to that!â€™  from sleary.

the latter part of this speech was addressed to mr. gradgrind, who
received it with a grave inclination of his head, and then remarked:

â€˜the only observation i will make to you, jupe, in the way of influencing
your decision, is, that it is highly desirable to have a sound practical
education, and that even your father himself (from what i understand)
appears, on your behalf, to have known and felt that much.â€™

the last words had a visible effect upon her.  she stopped in her wild
crying, a little detached herself from emma gordon, and turned her face

full upon her patron.  the whole company perceived the force of the
change, and drew a long breath together, that plainly said, â€˜she will
go!â€™

say no more.  be sure you know your own mind!â€™

â€˜when father comes back,â€™ cried the girl, bursting into tears again after
a minuteâ€™s silence, â€˜how will he ever find me if i go away!â€™

â€˜you may be quite at ease,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, calmly; he worked out the
whole matter like a sum: â€˜you may be quite at ease, jupe, on that score.
in such a case, your father, i apprehend, must find out mr.â€”â€™

â€˜thleary.  thath my name, thquire.  not athamed of it.  known all over

no difficulty, at any time, in finding mr. thomas gradgrind of coket

there was another silence; and then she exclaimed, sobbing with her hands
before her face, â€˜oh, give me my clothes, give me my clothes, and let me
go away before i break my heart!â€™

the women sadly bestirred themselves to get the clothes togetherâ€”it was
soon done, for they were not manyâ€”and to pack them in a basket which had
often travelled with them.  sissy sat all the time upon the ground, still
sobbing, and covering her eyes.  mr. gradgrind and his friend bounderby
stood near the door, ready to take her away.  mr. sleary stood in the
middle of the room, with the male members of the company about him,
exactly as he would have stood in the centre of the ring during his
daughter josephineâ€™s performance.  he wanted nothing but his whip.

the basket packed in silence, they brought her bonnet to her, and
smoothed her disordered hair, and put it on.  then they pressed about
her, and bent over her in very natural attitudes, kissing and

tender-hearted, simple, foolish set of women altogether.

â€˜now, jupe,â€™ said mr. gradgrind.  â€˜if you are quite determined, come!â€™

but she had to take her farewell of the male part of the company yet, and
every one of them had to unfold his arms (for they all assumed the
professional attitude when they found themselves near sleary), and give
her a parting kissâ€”master kidderminster excepted, in whose young nature
there was an original flavour of the misanthrope, who was also known to
have harboured matrimonial views, and who moodily withdrew.  mr. sleary

with that he regarded her attentively with his fixed eye, surveyed his
company with his loose one, kissed her, shook his head, and handed her to
mr. gradgrind as to a horse.

orator of this kind brought into his peroration,

â€”it was, for certain, more or less understood among the company that he
had heard of mrs. sparsit.

â€˜mr. bounderby,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, â€˜you are unusually slow, sir, with
your breakfast this morning.â€™

â€˜why, maâ€™am,â€™ he returned, â€˜i am thinking about tom gradgrindâ€™s whim;â€™
tom gradgrind, for a bluff independent manner of speakingâ€”as if somebody
were always endeavouring to bribe him with immense sums to say thomas,
and he wouldnâ€™t; â€˜tom gradgrindâ€™s whim, maâ€™am, of bringing up the
tumbling-girl.â€™

â€˜the girl is now waiting to know,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, â€˜whether she is to
go straight to the school, or up to the lodge.â€™

â€˜she must wait, maâ€™am,â€™ answered bounderby, â€˜till i know myself.  we

he might sleep on it before he decided to let her have any association

â€˜indeed, mr. bounderby?  very thoughtful of you!â€™  mrs. sparsitâ€™s
coriolanian nose underwent a slight expansion of the nostrils, and her
black eyebrows contracted as she took a sip of tea.

â€˜itâ€™s tolerably clear to _me_,â€™ said bounderby, â€˜that the little puss can
get small good out of such companionship.â€™

â€˜are you speaking of young miss gradgrind, mr. bounderby?â€™

â€˜yes, maâ€™am, iâ€™m speaking of louisa.â€™

â€˜your observation being limited to â€œlittle puss,â€â€™ said mrs. sparsit,
â€˜and there being two little girls in question, i did not know which might
be indicated by that expression.â€™

â€˜louisa,â€™ repeated mr. bounderby.  â€˜louisa, louisa.â€™

â€˜you are quite another father to louisa, sir.â€™  mrs. sparsit took a
little more tea; and, as she bent her again contracted eyebrows over her
steaming cup, rather looked as if

â€˜if you had said i was another father to tomâ€”young tom, i mean, not my

â€˜indeed?  rather young for that, is he not, sir?â€™  mrs. spiritâ€™s â€˜sir,â€™
in addressing mr. bounderby, was a word of ceremony, rather exacting
consideration for herself in the use, than honouring him.

â€˜iâ€™m not going to take him at once; he is to finish his educational
cramming before then,â€™ said bounderby.  â€˜by the lord harry, heâ€™ll have

â€˜it is true, sir,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit, with an affectation of humility
the very opposite of his, and therefore in no danger of jostling it.

â€˜you were in the tiptop fashion, and all the rest of it,â€™ said mr.
bounderby.

â€˜yes, sir,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit, with a kind of social widowhood upon
her.  â€˜it is unquestionably true.â€™

mr. bounderby, bending himself at the knees, literally embraced his legs
in his great satisfaction and laughed aloud.  mr. and miss gradgrind
being then announced, he received the former with a shake of the hand,
and the latter with a kiss.

â€˜can jupe be sent here, bounderby?â€™ asked mr. gradgrind.

certainly.  so jupe was sent there.  on coming in, she curtseyed to mr.
bounderby, and to his friend tom gradgrind, and also to louisa; but in
her confusion unluckily omitted mrs. sparsit.  observing this, the
blustrous bounderby had the following remarks to make:

â€˜now, i tell you what, my girl.  the name of that lady by the teapot,

from having high connections i have no connections at all, and i come of
the scum of the earth.  but towards that lady, i do care what you do; and
you shall do what is deferential and respectful, or you shall not come
here.â€™

â€˜i hope, bounderby,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, in a conciliatory voice, â€˜that
this was merely an oversight.â€™

â€˜my friend tom gradgrind suggests, mrs. sparsit,â€™ said bounderby, â€˜that
this was merely an oversight.  very likely.  however, as you are aware,
maâ€™am, i donâ€™t allow of even oversights towards you.â€™

â€˜you are very good indeed, sir,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit, shaking her head
with her state humility.  â€˜it is not worth speaking of.â€™

sissy, who all this time had been faintly excusing herself with tears in
her eyes

, was now waved over by the master of the house to mr. gradgrind.
she stood looking intently at him, and louisa stood coldly by, with her
eyes upon the ground, while he proceeded thus:

â€˜jupe, i have made up my mind to take you into my house; and, when you
are not in attendance at the school, to employ you about mrs. gradgrind,
who is rather an invalid.  i have explained to miss louisaâ€”this is miss
louisaâ€”the miserable but natural end of your late career; and you are to
expressly understand that the whole of that subject is past, and is not
to be referred to any more.  from this time you begin your history.  you
are, at present, ignorant, i know.â€™

â€˜yes, sir, very,â€™ she answered, curtseying.

â€˜i shall have the satisfaction of causing you to be strictly educated;
and you will be a living proof to all who c

you, of the advantages of the training you will receive.  you will be
reclaimed and formed.  you have been in the habit now of reading to your
father, and those people i found you among, i dare say?â€™ said mr.
gradgrind, beckoning her nearer to him before he said so, and dropping
his voice.

â€˜only to father and merrylegs, sir.  at least i mean to father, when
merrylegs was always there.â€™

â€˜never mind merrylegs, jupe,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, with a passing frown.
â€˜i donâ€™t ask about him.  i understand you to have been in the habit of
reading to your father?â€™

â€˜o, yes, sir, thousands of times.  they were the happiestâ€”o, of all the
happy times we had together, sir!â€™

it was only now when her sorrow broke out, that louisa looked at her.

â€˜and what,â€™ asked mr. gradgrind, in a still lower voice, â€˜did you read to
your father, jupe?â€™

â€˜about the fairies, sir, and the dwarf, and the hunchback, and the

â€˜hush!â€™ said mr. gradgrind, â€˜that is enough.  never breathe a word of
such destructive nonsense any more.  bounderby, this is a case for rigid
training, and i shall observe it with interest.â€™

â€˜well,â€™ returned mr. bounderby, â€˜i have given you my opinion already, and
i shouldnâ€™t do as you do.  but, very well, very well.  since you are bent
upon it, _very_ well!â€™

so, mr. gradgrind and his daughter took cecilia jupe off with them to
stone lodge, and on the way louisa never spoke one word, good or bad.
and mr. bounderby went about his daily pursuits.  and mrs. sparsit got
behind her eyebrows and meditated in the gloom of that retreat, all the
evening.

when she was half a dozen years younger, louisa had been overheard to
begin a conversation with her brother one day, by saying â€˜tom

forth into the light and said, â€˜louisa, never wonder!â€™

reason without stooping to the cultivation of the sentiments and
affections.  never wonder.  by means of addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division, settle everything somehow, and never

ing.  they wondered about human nature, human passions, human hopes
and fears, the struggles, triumphs and defeats, the cares and joys and
sorrows, the lives and deaths of common men and women!  they sometimes,
after fifteen hoursâ€™ work, sat down to read mere fables about men and
women, more or less like themselves, and about children, more or less
like their own.  they took de foe to their bosoms, instead of euclid, and
seemed to be on the whole more comforted by goldsmith than by cocker.
mr. gradgrind was for ever working, in print and out of print, at this
eccentric sum, and he never could make out how it yielded this
unaccountable product.

â€˜i am sick of my life, loo.  i, hate it altogether, and i hate everybody
except you,â€™ said the unnatural young thomas gradgrind in the
hair-cutting chamber at twilight.

â€˜you donâ€™t hate sissy, tom?â€™

â€˜i hate to be obliged to call her jupe.  and she hates me,â€™ said tom,
moodily.

â€˜no, she does not, tom, i am sure!â€™

could make of it.

â€˜except that it is a fire,â€™ said tom, â€˜it looks to me as stupid and blank
as everything else looks.  what do you see in it?  not a circus?â€™

â€˜i donâ€™t see anything in it, tom, particularly.  but since i have been
looking at it, i have been wondering about you and me, grown up.â€™

â€˜wondering again!â€™ said tom.

â€˜i have such unmanageable thoughts,â€™ returned his sister, â€˜that they
_will_ wonder.â€™

â€˜then i beg of you, louisa,â€™ said mrs. gradgrind, who had opened the door
without being heard, â€˜to do nothing of that description, for goodnessâ€™
sake, you inconsiderate girl, or i shall never hear the last of it from
your father.  and, thomas, it is really shameful, with my poor head
continually wearing me out, that a boy brought up as you have been, and
whose education has cost what yours has, should be found encouraging his
sister to wonder, when he knows his father has expressly said that she is
not to do it.â€™

louisa denied tomâ€™s

participation in the offence; but her mother stopped
her with the conclusive answer, â€˜louisa, donâ€™t tell me, in my state of
health; for unless you had been encouraged, it is morally and physically
impossible that you could have done it.â€™

â€˜i was encouraged by nothing, mother, but by looking at the red sparks
dropping out of the fire, and whitening and dying.  it made me think,
after all, how short my life would be, and how little i could hope to do
in it.â€™

â€˜nonsense!â€™ said mrs. gradgrind, rendered almost energetic.  â€˜nonsense!
donâ€™t stand there and tell me such stuff, louisa, to my face, when you
know very well that if it was ever to reach your fatherâ€™s ears i should
never hear the last of it.  after all the trouble that has been taken
with you!  after the lectures you have attended, and the experiments you
have seen!  after i have heard you myself, when the whole of my right
side has been benumbed, going on with your master about combustion, and

way about sparks and ashes!  i wish,â€™ whimpered mrs. gradgrind, taking a
chair, and discharging her strongest point before succumbing under these
mere shadows of facts, â€˜yes, i really _do_ wish that i had never had a
family, and then you would have known what it was to do without me!â€™



chapter ix
sissyâ€™s progress


sissy jupe had not an easy time of it, between mr. mâ€™choakumchild and
mrs. gradgrind, and was not without strong impulses, in the first months
of her probation, to run away.  it hailed facts all day long so very
hard, and life in gener

 calculation,
and went dead against any table of probabilities that any actuary would
have drawn up from the premises.  the girl believed that her father had
not deserted her; she lived in the hope that he would come back, and in
the faith that he would be made the happier by her remaining where she
was.

the wretched ignorance with which jupe clung to this consolation,
rejecting the superior comfort of knowing, on a sound arithmetical basis,
that her father was an unnatural vagabond, filled mr. gradgrind with
pity.  yet, what was to be done?  mâ€™choakumchild reported that she had a
very dense head for figures; that, once possessed with a general idea of
the globe, she took the smallest conceivable interest in its exact
measurements; that she was extremely slow in the acquisition of dates,
unless some pitiful incident happened to be connected therewith; that she
would burst into tears on being required (by the mental process)
immediately to name the cost of two hundred and forty-seven muslin ca

ps
at fourteen-pence halfpenny; that she was as low down, in the school, as
low could be; that after eight weeks of induction into the elements of
political economy, she had only yesterday been set right by a prattler
three feet high, for returning to the question, â€˜what is the first
principle of this science?â€™ the absurd answer, â€˜to do unto others as i
would that they should do unto me.â€™

mr. gradgrind observed, shaking his head, that all this was very bad;
that it showed the necessity of infinite grinding at the mill of
knowledge, as per system, schedule, blue book, report, and tabular
statements a to z; and that jupe â€˜must be kept to it.â€™  so jupe was kept
to it, and became low-spirited, but no wiser.

â€˜it would be a fine thing to be you, miss louisa!â€™ she said, one night,
when louisa had endeavoured to make her perplexities for next day
something clearer to her.

â€˜do you think so

him, and i know he will come back.  every letter that i see in mr.
gradgrindâ€™s hand takes my breath away and blinds my eyes, for i think it
comes from father, or from mr. sleary about father.  mr. sleary promised
to write as soon as ever father should be heard of, and i trust to him to
keep his word.â€™

â€˜do look sharp for old bounderby, loo!â€™ said tom, with an impatient
whistle.  â€˜heâ€™ll be off if you donâ€™t look sharp!â€™

after this, whenever sissy dropped a curtsey to mr. gradgrind in the
presence of his family, and said in a faltering way, â€˜i beg your pardon,
sir, for being troublesomeâ€”butâ€”have you had any letter yet about me?â€™
louisa would suspend the occupation of the moment, whatever it was, and
look for the reply as earnestly as sissy did.  and when mr. gradgrind
regularly answered, â€˜no, jupe, nothing of the sort,â€™ the trembling of
sissyâ€™s lip would be repeated in louisaâ€™s face, and her eyes would follow
sissy with compassion to the door.  mr. gradgri

y remarking, when she was gone, that if jupe had been properly
trained from an early age she would have remonstrated to herself on sound
principles the baselessness of these fantastic hopes.  yet it did seem
(though not to him, for he saw nothing of it) as if fantastic hope could
take as strong a hold as fact.

this observation must be limited exclusively to his daughter.  as to tom,
he was becoming that not unprecedented triumph of calculation which is
usually at work on number one.  as to mrs. gradgrind, if she said
anything on the subject, she would come a little way out of her wrappers,
like a feminine dormouse, and say:

â€˜good gracious bless me, how my poor head is vexed and worried by that
girl jupeâ€™s so perseveringly asking, over and over again, about her
tiresome letters!  upon my word and honour i seem to be fated, and
destined, and ordained, to live in the midst of things that i am never to
hear the last of.  it really is a most extraordinary circumstance that it
appears as if i ne

at about this point, mr. gradgrindâ€™s eye would fall upon her; and under
the influence of that wintry piece of fact, she would become torpid
again.

the great manufacturer


time went on in coketown like its own machinery: so much material wrought
up, so much fuel consumed, so many powers worn out, so much money made.
but, less inexorable than iron, steel, and brass, it brought its varying
seasons even into that wilderness of smoke and brick, and made the only
stand that ever _was_ made in the place against its direful uniformity.

â€˜louisa is becoming,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, â€˜almost a young woman.â€™

time, with his innumerable horse-power, worked away, not minding what
anybody said, and presently turned out young thomas a foot taller than
when his father had last taken particular notice of him.

â€˜thomas is becoming,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, â€˜almost a young man.â€™

time passed thomas on in the mill, while his father was thinking about
it, and there he stood in a long-tailed coat and a stiff shirt-collar.

â€˜really,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, â€˜the period has ar

time, sticking to him, passed him on into bounderbyâ€™s bank, made him an
inmate of bounderbyâ€™s house, necessitated the purchase of his first
razor, and exercised him diligently in his calculations relative to
number one.

the same great manufacturer, always with an immense variety of work on
hand, in every stage of development, passed sissy onward in his mill, and
worked her up into a very pretty article indeed.

â€˜i fear, jupe,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, â€˜that your continuance at the school
any longer would be useless.â€™

â€˜i am afraid it would, sir,â€™ sissy answered with a curtsey.

â€˜i cannot disguise from you, jupe,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, knitting his
brow, â€˜that the result of your probation there has disappointed me; has
greatly disappointed me.  you have not acquired, under mr. and mrs.
mâ€™choakumchild, anything like that amount of exact knowledge which i
looked for.  you are extremely deficient in your facts.  your

and below the mark.â€™

â€˜i am sorry, sir,â€™ she returned; â€˜but i know it is quite true.  yet i
have tried hard, sir.â€™

â€˜yes,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, â€˜yes, i believe you have tried hard; i have
observed you, and i can find no fault in that respect.â€™

â€˜thank you, sir.  i have thought sometimes;â€™ sissy very timid here; â€˜that
perhaps i tried to learn too much, and that if i had asked to be allowed
to try a little less, i might haveâ€”â€™

â€˜no, jupe, no,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, shaking his head in his profoundest
and most eminently practical way.  â€˜no.  the course you pursued, you
pursued according to the systemâ€”the systemâ€”and

there is no more to be
said about it.  i can only suppose that the circumstances of your early
life were too unfavourable to the development of your reasoning powers,
and that we began too late.  still, as i have said already, i am
disappointed.â€™

â€˜i wish i could have made a better acknowledgment, sir, of your kindness
to a poor forlorn girl who had no claim upon you, and of your protection
of her.â€™

â€˜donâ€™t shed tears,â€™ said mr. gradgrind.  â€˜donâ€™t shed tears.  i donâ€™t
complain of you.  you are an affectionate, earnest, good young
womanâ€”andâ€”and we must make that do.â€™

â€˜thank you, sir, very much,â€™ said sissy, with a grateful curtsey.

â€˜you are useful to mrs. gradgrind, and (in a generally pervading way) you
are serviceable in the family also; so i understand from miss louisa,
and, indeed, so i have observed myself.  i therefore hope,â€™ said mr.
gradgrind, â€˜that you can make yourself happy in those relations.â€

if your training in the science of arriving at exact results had been
more successful, you would have been wiser on these points.  i will say

he really liked sissy too well to have a contempt for her; otherwise he
held her calculating powers in such very slight estimation that he must
have fallen upon that conclusion.  somehow or other, he had become

be easily stated at a very low figure, her mathematical knowledge at

quite known how to divide her.

in some stages of his manufacture of the human fabric, the processes of
time are very rapid.  young thomas and sissy being both at such a stage
of their working up, these changes were effected in a year or two; while

alteration.

hundred and odd years after our master?

all this while, louisa had been passing on, so quiet and reserved, and so
much given to watching the bright ashes at twilight as they fell into the
grate, and became extinct, that from the period when her father had said
she was almost a young womanâ€”which seemed but yesterdayâ€”she had scarcely
attracted his notice again, when he found her quite a young woman.

â€˜quite a young woman,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, musing.  â€˜dear me!â€™

soon after this discovery, he became more thoughtful than usual for
several days, and seemed much engrossed by one subject.  on a certain
night, when he was going out, and louisa came to bid him good-bye before
his departureâ€”as he was not to be home until late and she would not see
him again until the morningâ€”he held her in his arms, looking at her in
his kindest manner, and said:

â€˜my dear louisa, you are a woman!â€™

she answered with the old, quick, searching

â€˜yes, father.â€™

â€˜your hands are rather cold, louisa.  are you not well?â€™

â€˜quite well, father.â€™

â€˜and cheerful?â€™

she looked at him again, and smiled in her peculiar manner.  â€˜i am as
cheerful, father, as i usually am, or usually have been.â€™

â€˜thatâ€™s well,â€™ said mr. gradgrind.  so, he kissed her and went away; and

it seemed as if, first in her own fire within the house, and then in the
fiery haze without, she tried to discover what kind of woof old time,
that greatest and longest-established spinner of all, would weave from
the threads he had already spun into a woman.  but his factory is a
secret place, his work is noiseless, and his hands are mutes.

although mr. gradgrind did not take after blue beard, his room was quite
a blue chamber in its abundance of blue books.  whatever they could prove
(which is usually anything you like), they proved there, in an army
constantly strengthening by the arrival of new recruits.  in that charmed
apartment, the most complicated social questions were cast up, got into
exact totals, and finally settledâ€”if those concerned could only have been
brought to know it.  as if an astronomical observatory should be made

dows, and the astronomer within should arrange the starry
universe solely by pen, ink, and paper, so mr. gradgrind, in _his_
observatory (and there are many like it), had no need to cast an eye upon
the teeming myriads of human beings around him, but could settle all
their destinies on a slate, and wipe out all their tears with one dirty
little bit of sponge.

to this observatory, then: a stern room, with a deadly statistical clock
in it, which measured every second with a beat like a rap upon a
coffin-lid; louisa repaired on the appointed morning.  a window looked
towards coketown; and when she sat down ne

he waited, as if he would have been glad that she said something.  but
she said never a word.

â€˜louisa, my dear, you are the subject of a proposal of marriage that has
been made to me.â€™

again he waited, and again she answered not one word.  this so far
surprised him, as to induce him gently to repeat, â€˜a proposal of
marriage, my dear.â€™  to which she returned, without any visible emotion
whatever:

â€˜i hear you, father.  i am attending, i assure you.â€™

â€˜well!â€™ said mr. gradgrind, breaking into a smile, after being for the
moment at a loss, â€˜you are even more dispassionate than i expected,
louisa.  or, perhaps, you are not unprepared for the announcement i have
it in charge to make?â€™

â€˜i cannot say that, father, until i hear it.  prepared or unprepared, i
wish to hear it all from you.  i wish to hear you state it to me,
father.â€™

strange to relate, mr. gradgrind was not so collected at this moment as
his daughter was.  he took a paper-knife in his hand, turned i

which he has so long, and certainly with great constancy, looked forward,
is now come.  mr. bounderby has made his proposal of marriage to me, and
has entreated me to make it known to you, and to express his hope that
you will take it into your favourable consideration.â€™

silence between them.  the deadly statistical clock very hollow.  the
distant smoke very black and heavy.

â€˜father,â€™ said louisa, â€˜do you think i love mr. bounderby?â€™

mr. gradgrind was extremely discomfited by this unexpected question.
â€˜well, my child,â€™ he returned, â€˜iâ€”reallyâ€”cannot take upon myself to say.â€™

â€˜father,â€™ pursued louisa in exactly the same voice as before, â€˜do you ask
me to love mr. bounderby?â€™

â€˜my dear louisa, no.  no.  i ask nothing.â€™

â€˜father,â€™ she still pursued, â€˜does mr. bounderby ask me to love him?â€™

â€˜really, my dear,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, â€˜it is difficult to answer your
questionâ€”â€™

â€˜difficult to answer it,

to anything fanciful, fantastic, or (i am using synonymous terms)
sentimental.  mr. bounderby would have seen you grow up under his eyes,
to very little purpose, if he could so far forget what is due to your
good sense, not to say to his, as to address you from any such ground.
therefore, perhaps the expression itselfâ€”i merely suggest this to you, my
dearâ€”may be a little misplaced.â€™

â€˜what would you advise me to use in its stead, father?â€™

â€˜why, my dear louisa,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, completely recovered by this
time, â€˜i would advise you (since you ask me) to consider this question,
as you have been accustomed to consider every other question, simply as
one of tangible fact.  the ignorant and the giddy may embarrass such
subjects with irrelevant fancies, and other absurdities that have no
existence, properly viewedâ€”really no existenceâ€”but it is no compliment to
you to say, that you know better.  now, what are the facts of this case?

 remaining question then is: shall i marry him?  i think
nothing can be plainer than that?â€™

â€˜shall i marry him?â€™ repeated louisa, with great deliberation.

â€˜precisely.  and it is satisfactory to me, as your father, my dear
louisa, to know that you do not come to the consideration of that
question with the previous habits of mind, and habits of life, that
belong to many young women.â€™

â€˜no, father,â€™ she returned, â€˜i do not.â€™

â€˜i now leave you to judge for yourself,â€™ said mr. gradgrind.  â€˜i have
stated the case, as such cases are usually stated among practical minds;
i have stated it, as the case of your mother and myself was stated in its
time.  the rest, my dear louisa, is for you to decide.â€™

from the beginning, she had sat looking at him fixedly.  as he now leaned
back in his chair, and bent his deep-set eyes upon her in his turn,
perhaps he might have seen one wavering moment in her, when she was
impelled to throw herself upon his breast, and give him the pent-up

her attention upon him again, said, â€˜father, i have often thought that
life is very short.â€™â€”this was so distinctly one of his subjects that he
interposed.

â€˜it is short, no doubt, my dear.  still, the average duration of human
life is proved to have increased of late years.  the calculations of
various life assurance and annuity offices, among other figures which
cannot go wrong, have established the fact.â€™

â€˜i speak of my own life, father.â€™

â€˜o indeed?  still,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, â€˜i need not point out to you,
louisa, that it is governed by the laws which govern lives in the
aggregate.â€™

â€˜while it lasts, i would wish to do the little i can, and the little i am
fit for.  what does it matter?â€™

mr. gradgrind seemed rather at a loss to understand the last four words;
replying, â€˜how, matter?  what matter, my dear?â€™

â€˜mr. bounderby,â€™ she went on in a steady, straight way, without regarding
this, â€˜asks me to marry him.  the question i have to ask myself is, 
 
 ___________________________
 
 it be so.  since mr. bounderby likes to take me thus, i am satisfied
to accept his proposal.  tell him, father, as soon as you please, that
this was my answer.  repeat it, word for word, if you can, because i
should wish him to know what i said.â€™

â€˜it is quite right, my dear,â€™ retorted her father approvingly, â€˜to be
exact.  i will observe your very proper request.  have you any wish in
reference to the period of your marriage, my child?â€™

â€˜none, father.  what does it matter!â€™

mr. gradgrind had drawn his chair a little nearer to her, and taken her
hand.  but, her repetition of these words seemed to strike with some
little discord on his ear.  he paused to look at her, and, still holding
her hand, said:

â€˜louisa, i have not considered it essential to ask you one question,
because the possibility implied in it appeared to me to be too remote.
but perhaps i ought to do so.  you have never entertained in secret any
other proposal?â€™

â€˜father,â€™ she returned, almost scornfully, â

€˜what other proposal can have
been made to _me_?  whom have i seen?  where have i been?  what are my
heartâ€™s experiences?â€™

â€˜my dear louisa,â€™ returned mr. gradgrind, reassured and satisfied.  â€˜you
correct me justly.  i merely wished to discharge my duty.â€™

â€˜what do _i_ know, father,â€™ said louisa in her quiet manner, â€˜of tastes
and fancies; of aspirations and affections; of all that part of my nature
in which such light things might have been nourished?  what escape have i
had from problems that could be demonstrated, and realities that could be
grasped?â€™  as she said it, she unconsciously closed her hand, as if upon
a solid object, and slowly o

te true, quite

â€˜why, father,â€™ she pursued, â€˜what a strange question to ask _me_!  the
baby-preference that even i have heard of as common among children, has
never had its innocent resting-place in my breast.  you have been so
careful of me, that i never had a childâ€™s heart.  you have trained me so
well, that i never dreamed a childâ€™s dream.  you have dealt so wisely
with me, father, from my cradle to this hour, that i never had a childâ€™s
belief or a childâ€™s fear.â€™

mr. gradgrind was quite moved by his success, and by this testimony to
it.  â€˜my dear louisa,â€™ said he, â€˜you abundantly repay my care.  kiss me,
my dear girl.â€™

so, his daughter kissed him.  detaining her in his embrace, he said, â€˜i
may assure you now, my favourite child, that i am made happy by the sound
decision at which you have arrived.  mr. bounderby is a very remarkable
man; and what little disparity can be said to exist between youâ€”if anyâ€”is
more than counterbalanced by the tone your mind

in your early youth, be (if i may so express myself) almost any age.

accordingly, they went down to the drawing-room, where the esteemed lady
with no nonsense about her, was recumbent as usual, while sissy worked
beside her.  she gave some feeble signs of returning animation when they
entered, and presently the faint transparency was presented in a sitting
attitude.

â€˜mrs. gradgrind,â€™ said her husband, who had waited for the achievement of
this feat with some impatience, â€˜allow me to present to you mrs.
bounderby.â€™

â€˜oh!â€™ said mrs. gradgrind, â€˜so you have settled it!  well, iâ€™m sure i
hope your health may be good, louisa; for if your head begins to split as
soon as you are married, which was the case with mine, i cannot consider
that you are to be envied, though i have no doubt you think you are, as
all girls do.  however, i give you joy, my dearâ€”and i hope

 you may now
turn all your ological studies to good account, i am sure i do!  i must
give you a kiss of congratulation, louisa; but donâ€™t touch my right
shoulder, for thereâ€™s something running down it all day long.  and now
you see,â€™ whimpered mrs. gradgrind, adjusting her shawls after the
affectionate ceremony, â€˜i shall be worrying myself, morning, noon, and
night, to know what i am to call him!â€™

â€˜mrs. gradgrind,â€™ said her husband, solemnly, â€˜what do you mean?â€™

â€˜whatever i am to call him, mr. gradgrind, when he is married to louisa!
i must call him something.  itâ€™s impossible,â€™ said mrs. gradgrind, with a
mingled sense of politeness and injury, â€˜to be constantly addressing him
and never giving him a name.  i cannot call him josiah, for the name is
insupportable to me.  you yourself wouldnâ€™t hear of joe, you very well
know.  am i to call my own son-in-law, mister!  not, i believe, unles

the time has arrived when, as an invalid, i am to be trampled upon by my
relations.  then, what am i to call him!â€™

nobody present having any suggestion to offer in the remarkable
emergency, mrs. gradgrind departed this life for the time being, after
delivering the following codicil to her remarks already executed:

â€˜as to the wedding, all i ask, louisa, is,â€”and i ask it with a fluttering
in my chest, which actually extends to the soles of my feet,â€”that it may
take place soon.  otherwise, i know it is one of those subjects i shall
never hear the last of.â€™

when mr. gradgrind had presented mrs. bounderby, sissy had suddenly
turned her head, and looked, in wonder, in pity, in sorrow, in dou

â€˜sir,â€™ returned the lady, â€˜this is indeed not the first time that you
have honoured me with similar expressions of your good opinion.â€™

â€˜mrs. sparsit, maâ€™am,â€™ said mr. bounderby, â€˜i am going to astonish you.â€™

â€˜yes, sir?â€™ returned mrs. sparsit, interrogatively, and in the most
tranquil manner possible.  she generally wore mittens, and she now laid
down her work, and smoothed those mittens.

â€˜i am going, maâ€™am,â€™ said bounderby, â€˜to marry tom gradgrindâ€™s daughter.â€™

â€˜yes, sir,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit.  â€˜i hope you may be happy, mr.
bounderby.  oh, indeed i hope you may be happy, sir!â€™  and she said it
with such great condescension as well as with such great compassion for
him, that bounderby,â€”far more disconcerted than if she had thrown her
workbox at the mirror, or swooned on the hearthrug,â€”corked up the
smelling-salts tight in his pocket, and thought, â€˜now confound this
woman, who could have even guessed that she would take

article in a savoury brown sauce was her favourite supper: â€˜and i would

accept your offer gratefully, and with many sincere acknowledgments for
past favours.  and i hope, sir,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, concluding in an
impressively compassionate manner, â€˜i fondly hope that miss gradgrind may
be all you desire, and deserve!â€™

nothing moved mrs. sparsit from that position any more.  it was in vain
for bounderby to bluster or to assert himself in any of his explosive
ways; mrs. sparsit was resolved to have compassion on him, as a victim.
she was polite, obliging, cheerful, hopeful; but, the more polite, the
more obliging, the more cheerful, the more hopeful, the more exemplary
altogether, she; the forlorner sacrifice and victim, he.  she had that

period of betrothal, took a manufacturing
aspect.  dresses were made, jewellery was made, cakes and gloves were
made, settlements were made, and an extensive assortment of facts did
appropriate honour to the contract.  the business was all fact, from
first to last.  the hours did not go through any of those rosy
performances, which foolish poets have ascribed to them at such times;
neither did the clocks go any faster, or any slower, than at other
seasons.  the deadly statistical recorder in the gradgrind observatory
knocked every second on the head as it was born, and buried it with his
accustomed regularity.

so the day came, as all other days come to people who will only stick to
reason; and when it came, there were married in the church of the florid
wooden legsâ€”that popular order of architectureâ€”josiah bounderby esquire
of coketown, to louisa eldest daughter of thomas gradgrind esquire of
stone lodge, m.p. for that borough.  and when they were united in holy
matrimony, they went home to

 breakfast at stone lodge aforesaid.

there was an improving party assembled on the auspicious occasion, who
knew what everything they had to eat and drink was made of, and how it
was imported or exported, and in what quantities, and in what bottoms,
whether native or foreign, and all about it.  the bridesmaids, down to
little jane gradgrind, were, in an intellectual point of view, fit
helpmates for the calculating boy; and there was no nonsense about any of
the company.

after breakfast, the bridegroom addressed them in the following terms:

â€˜ladies and gentlemen, i am josiah bounderby of coketown.  since you have
done my wife and myself the honour of drinking our healths and happiness,
i suppose i must acknowledge the same; though, as you all know me, and
know what i am, and what my extraction was, you wonâ€™t expect a speech

speech this morning, my friend and father-in-law, tom gradgrind, is a
member of parliament, and you know where to get it.  i am not your man.
however, if i feel a little independent when i look around this table
to-day, and reflect how little i thought of marrying tom gradgrindâ€™s
daughter when i was a ragged street-boy, who never washed his face unless
it was at a pump, and that not oftener than once a fortnight, i hope i
may be excused.  so, i hope you like my feeling independent; if you
donâ€™t, i canâ€™t help it.  i _do_ feel independent.  now i have mentioned,
and you have mentioned, that i am this day married to tom gradgrindâ€™s

mrs. sparsit recognized the hand, intimated that such confirmation was
quite unnecessary, and gave mr. bounderbyâ€™s address, with all needful
clues and directions in aid.

â€˜thousand thanks,â€™ said the stranger.  â€˜of course you know the banker
well?â€™

â€˜yes, sir,â€™ rejoined mrs. sparsit.  â€˜in my dependent relation towards
him, i have known him ten years.â€™

â€˜quite an eternity!  i think he married gradgrindâ€™s daughter?â€™

â€˜yes,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, suddenly compressing her mouth, â€˜he had
thatâ€”honour.â€™

â€˜the lady is quite a philosopher, i am told?â€™

â€˜indeed, sir,â€™ said mrs. sparsit.  â€˜_is_ she?â€™

â€˜excuse my impertinent curiosity,â€™ pursued the stranger, fluttering over
mrs. sparsitâ€™s eyebrows, with a propitiatory air, â€˜but you know the

that her nocturnal sweetbread was ready, did mrs. sparsit arouse herself

creased with meditation, as if they needed ironing out-up-stairs.

â€˜o, you fool!â€™ said mrs. sparsit, when she was alone at her supper.  whom
she meant, she did not say; but she could scarcely have meant the

chapter ii
mr. james harthouse


the gradgrind party wanted assistance in cutting the throats of the
graces.  they went about recruiting; and where could they enlist recruits
more hopefully, than among the fine gentlemen who, having found out
everything to be worth nothing, were equally ready for anything?

moreover, the healthy spirits who had mounted to this sublime height were
attractive to many of the gradgrind school.  they liked fine gentlemen;
they pretended that they did not, but they did.  they became exhausted in
imitation of them

; and they yaw-yawed in their speech like them; and they
served out, with an enervated air, the little mouldy rations of political
economy, on which they regaled their disciples.  there never before was
seen on earth such a wonderful hybrid race as was thus produced.

among the fine gentlemen not regularly belonging to the gradgrind school,
there was one of a good family and a better appearance, with a happy turn
of humour which had told immensely with the house of commons on the
occasion of his entertaining it with his (and the board of directors)
view of a railway accident, in which the most careful officers ever
known, employed by the most liberal managers ever heard of, assisted by
the finest mechanical contrivances ever devised, the whole in action on
the best line ever constructed, had killed five people and wounded

go in for statistics.â€™  jem, rather
taken by the novelty of the idea, and very hard up for a change, was as
ready to â€˜go inâ€™ for statistics as for anything else.  so, he went in.
he coached himself up with a blue-book or two; and his brother put it
about among the hard fact fellows, and said, â€˜if you want to bring in,
for any place, a handsome dog who can make you a devilish good speech,
look after my brother jem, for heâ€™s your man.â€™  after a few dashes in the
public meeting way, mr. gradgrind and a council of political sages
approved of jem, and it was resolved to send him down to coketown, to
become known there and in the neighbourhood.  hence the letter jem had
last night shown to mrs. sparsit, which mr. bounderby now held in his
hand; superscribed, â€˜josiah bounderby, esquire, banker, coketown.
specially to introduce james harthouse, esquire.  thomas gradgrind.â€™

within an hour of the receipt of this dispatch and mr. james harthouseâ€™s
card, mr. bounderby put on his hat and w

 the place.â€™

mr. harthouse professed himself in the highest degree instructed and
refreshed, by this condensed epitome of the whole coketown question.

â€˜why, you see,â€™ replied mr. bounderby, â€˜it suits my disposition to have a
full understanding with a man, particularly with a public man, when i
make his acquaintance.  i have only one thing more to say to you, mr.
harthouse, before assuring you of the pleasure with which i shall
respond, to the utmost of my poor ability, to my friend tom gradgrindâ€™s
letter of introduction.  you are a man of family.  donâ€™t you deceive
yourself by supposing for a moment that i am a man of family.  i am a bit
of dirty riff-raff, and a genuine scrap of tag, rag, and bobtail.â€™

if anything could have exalted jemâ€™s interest in mr. bounderby, it would
have been this very circumstance.  or, so he told him.

â€˜so now,â€™ said bounderby, â€˜we may shake hands on equal terms.  i say,
equal terms, because although i know what i am, and the exact depth of
th
 
 ___________________________
 
are.  having now asserted my
independence in a proper manner, i may come to how do you find yourself,
and i hope youâ€™re pretty well.â€™

the better, mr. harthouse gave him to understand as they shook hands, for
the salubrious air of coketown.  mr. bounderby received the answer with
favour.

â€˜perhaps you know,â€™ said he, â€˜or perhaps you donâ€™t know, i married tom
gradgrindâ€™s daughter.  if you have nothing better to do than to walk up
town with me, i shall be glad to introduce you to tom gradgrindâ€™s
daughter.â€™

â€˜mr. bounderby,â€™ said jem, â€˜you anticipate my dearest wishes.â€™

they went out without further discourse; and mr. bounderby piloted the
new acquaintance who so strongly contrasted with him, to the private red
brick dwelling, with the black outside shutters, the green inside blinds,
and the black street door up the two white steps.  in the drawing-room of
which mansion, there presently entered to them the most remarkable girl
mr. james harthouse had ever seen.  she was s

tle device, however trivial, anywhere expressed
her influence.  cheerless and comfortless, boastfully and doggedly rich,
there the room stared at its present occupants, unsoftened and unrelieved
by the least trace of any womanly occupation.  as mr. bounderby stood in
the midst of his household gods, so those unrelenting divinities occupied
their places around mr. bounderby, and they were worthy of one another,
and well matched.

â€˜this, sir,â€™ said bounderby, â€˜is my wife, mrs. bounderby: tom gradgrindâ€™s
eldest daughter.  loo, mr. james harthouse.  mr. harthouse has joined
your fatherâ€™s muster-roll.  if he is not tom gradgrindâ€™s colleague before
long, i believe we shall at least hear of him in connexion with one of
our neighbouring towns.  you observe, mr. harthouse, that my wife is my
junior.  i donâ€™t know what she saw in me to marry me, but she saw
something in me, i suppose, or she wouldnâ€™t have married me.  she has
lots of expensive knowledge, sir, political and otherwise.  if y

he nameâ€”is, that we know it
is all meaningless, and say so; while they know it equally and will never
say so.â€™

why should she be shocked or warned by this reiteration?  it was not so
unlike her fatherâ€™s principles, and her early training, that it need
startle her.  where was the great difference between the two schools,
when each chained her down to material realities, and inspired her with
no faith in anything else?  what was there in her soul for james
harthouse to destroy, which thomas gradgrind had nurtured there in its
state of innocence!

it was even the worse for her at this pass, that in her mindâ€”implanted
there before her eminently practical father began to form itâ€”a struggling
disposition to believe in a wider and nobler humanity than she had ever
heard of, constantly strove with doubts and resentments.  with doubts,
because the aspiration had been so laid waste in her youth.  with
resentments, because of the wrong that had been done her, if it were

nd further, that the female
bounderby, instead of being the gorgon he had expected, was young, and
remarkably pretty.  after that, he wrote no more about them, and devoted
his leisure chiefly to their house.  he was very often in their house, in
his flittings and visitings about the coketown district; and was much
encouraged by mr. bounderby.  it was quite in mr. bounderbyâ€™s gusty way
to boast to all his world that _he_ didnâ€™t care about your highly
connected people, but that if his wife tom gradgrindâ€™s daughter did, she
was welcome to their company.

mr. james harthouse began to think it would be a new sensation, if the
face which changed so beautifully for the whelp, would change for him.

he was quick enough to observe; he had a good memory, and did not forget
a word of the brotherâ€™s revelations.  he interwove them with everything
he saw of the sister, and he began to understand her.  to be sure, the
better and profounder part of her character was not within his scope of
perception; f

he was a ready man, and he saw, and seized, an opportunity here of
presenting her own image to her, slightly disguised as her brother.

â€˜mrs. bounderby, though a graceless person, of the world worldly, i feel
the utmost interest, i assure you, in what you tell me.  i cannot
possibly be hard upon your brother.  i understand and share the wise
consideration with which you regard his errors.  with all possible
respect both for mr. gradgrind and for mr. bounderby, i think i perceive
that he has not been fortunate in his training.  bred at a disadvantage
towards the society in which he has his part to play, he rushes into
these extremes for himself, from opposite extremes that have long been
forcedâ€”with the very best intentions we have no doubtâ€”upon him.  mr.

characteristic, does notâ€”as we have agreedâ€”invite confidence.  if i might

â€˜halloa!â€™ he stammered; â€˜i didnâ€™t know you were here.â€™

â€˜whose name, tom,â€™ said mr. harthouse, putting his hand upon his shoulder
and turning him, so that they all three walked towards the house
together, â€˜have you been carving on the trees?â€™

â€˜whose name?â€™ returned tom.  â€˜oh!  you mean what girlâ€™s name?â€™

â€˜you have a suspicious appearance of inscribing some fair creatureâ€™s on
the bark, tom.â€™

         [picture: mr. harthouse and tom gradgrind in the garden]

â€˜not much of that, mr. harthouse, unless some fair creature with a
slashing fortune at her own disposal would take a fancy to me.  or she
might be as ugly as she was rich, without any fear of losing me.  iâ€™d
carve her name as often as she liked.â€™

â€˜i am afraid you are mercenary, tom.â€™

â€˜mercenary,â€™ repeated tom.  â€˜who is not mercenary?  ask my sister.â€™

the other side, into which mr. james harthouse had a very strong

coketown threatened to pitch their property into the atlantic.  but he
preserved his easy attitude; and nothing more solid went over the stone
balustrades than the accumulated rosebuds now floating about, a little
surface-island.

â€˜my dear tom,â€™ said harthouse, â€˜let me try to be your banker.â€™

â€˜for godâ€™s sake,â€™ replied tom, suddenly, â€˜donâ€™t talk about bankers!â€™  and
very white he looked, in contrast with the roses.  very white.

he raised his eyelids a little more, as if they were lifted by a feeble
touch of wonder.  albeit it was as much against the precepts of his
school to wonder, as it was against the doctrines of the gradgrind
college.

â€˜what is the present need, tom?  three figures?  out with them.  say what
they are.â€™

â€˜mr. harthouse,â€™ returned tom, now actually crying; and his tears were
better than his injuries, however pitiful a figure he made: â€˜itâ€™s too
late; the money is of no use to me at present.  i should have had it
before to be of use to me.  but i am very much obliged to you; youâ€™re a
true friend.â€™

a true friend!  â€˜whelp, whelp!â€™ thought mr. harthouse, lazily; â€˜what an

so james harthouse reclined in the window, indolently smoking, and
reckoning up the steps he had taken on the road by which he happened to
be travelling.  the end to which it led was before him, pretty plainly;
but he troubled himself with no calculations about it.  what will be,
will be.

as he had rather a long ride to take that dayâ€”for there was a public
occasion â€˜to doâ€™ at some distance, which afforded a tolerable opportunity
of going in for the gradgrind menâ€”he dressed early and went down to
breakfast.  he was anxious to see if she had relapsed since the previous
evening.  no.  he resumed where he had left off.  there was a look of
interest for him again.

he got through the day as much (or as little) to his own satisfaction, as
was to be expected under the fatiguing circumstances; and came riding
back at six oâ€™clock.  there was a sweep of some half-mile between the
lodge and the house, and he was riding along at a foot pace over the

â€˜i suppose it might.â€™

â€˜suppose it might!  by the lord, you _may_ suppose so.  by george!â€™ said
mr. bounderby, with sundry menacing nods and shakes of his head.  â€˜it
might have been twice twenty.  thereâ€™s no knowing what it would have
been, or wouldnâ€™t have been, as it was, but for the fellowsâ€™ being

louisa had come up now, and mrs. sparsit, and bitzer.

â€˜hereâ€™s tom gradgrindâ€™s daughter knows pretty well what it might have
been, if you donâ€™t,â€™ blustered bounderby.  â€˜dropped, sir, as if she was
shot when i told her!  never knew her do such a thing before.  does her
credit, under the circumstances, in my opinion!â€™

she still looked faint and pale.  james harthouse begged her to take his
arm; and as they moved on very slowly, asked her how the robbery had been
committed.

emotion, she would force a lambent brightness, and would be fitfully
cheerful, and would say, â€˜you have still good spirits, sir, i am thankful
to find;â€™ and would appear to hail it as a blessed dispensation that mr.
bounderby bore up as he did.  one idiosyncrasy for which she often
apologized, she found it excessively difficult to conquer.  she had a
curious propensity to call mrs. bounderby â€˜miss gradgrind,â€™ and yielded
to it some three or four score times in the course of the evening.  her
repetition of this mistake covered mrs. sparsit with modest confusion;
but indeed, she said, it seemed so natural to say miss gradgrind:
whereas, to persuade herself that the young lady whom she had had the
happiness of knowing from a child could be really and truly mrs.
bounderby, she found almost impossible.  it was a further singularity of
this remarkable case, that the more she thought about it, the more

a bull-headed blundering way, sentimental, sighed like some large
sea-animal.  â€˜i cannot bear to see you so, sir,â€™ said mrs. sparsit.  â€˜try
a hand at backgammon, sir, as you used to do when i had the honour of
living under your roof.â€™  â€˜i havenâ€™t played backgammon, maâ€™am,â€™ said mr.
bounderby, â€˜since that time.â€™  â€˜no, sir,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, soothingly,
â€˜i am aware that you have not.  i remember that miss gradgrind takes no
interest in the game.  but i shall be happy, sir, if you will
condescend.â€™

they played near a window, opening on the garden.  it was a fine night:
not moonlight, but sultry and fragrant.  louisa and mr. harthouse
strolled out into the garden, where their voices could be heard in the
stillness, though not what they said.  mrs. sparsit, from her place at
the backgammon board, was constantly straining her eyes to pierce the
shadows without.  â€˜whatâ€™s the matter, maâ€™am?â€™ said mr.

fearful of miss gradgrindâ€™s taking cold.â€™  â€˜she never takes cold,â€™ said
mr. bounderby.  â€˜really, sir?â€™ said mrs. sparsit.  and was affected with
a cough in her throat.

when the time drew near for retiring, mr. bounderby took a glass of
water.  â€˜oh, sir?â€™ said mrs. sparsit.  â€˜not your sherry warm, with
lemon-peel and nutmeg?â€™  â€˜why, i have got out of the habit of taking it

the sort of thing you want, and ought to take, sir.â€™  and when mr.
bounderby said, â€˜your health, maâ€™am!â€™ she answered with great feeling,
â€˜thank you, sir.  the same to you, and happiness also.â€™  finally, she
wished him good night, with great pathos; and mr. bounderby went to bed,

him so long to get through, and his mind wandered so much in the course
of its execution.

â€˜you found miss gradgrindâ€”i really cannot call her mrs. bounderby; itâ€™s
very absurd of meâ€”as youthful as i described her?â€™ asked mrs. sparsit,
sweetly.

â€˜you drew her portrait perfectly,â€™ said mr. harthouse.  â€˜presented her
dead image.â€™

â€˜very engaging, sir,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, causing her mittens slowly to
revolve over one another.

now, these persistent assuagements of his misery, and lightenings of his
load, had by this time begun to have the effect of making mr. bounderby
softer than usual towards mrs. sparsit, and harder than usual to most
other people from his wife downward.  so, when mrs. sparsit said with
forced lightness of heart, â€˜you want your breakfast, sir, but i dare say
miss gradgrind will soon be here to preside at the table,â€™ mr. bounderby
replied, â€˜if i waited to be taken care of by my wife, maâ€™am, i believe
you know pretty well i should wait till doomsday, so iâ€™ll trouble _you_
to take charge of the teapot.â€™  mrs. sparsit complied, and assumed her
old position at table.

this again made the excellent woman vastly sentimental.  she was so
humble withal, that when louisa appeared, she rose, protesting she never

as she had had the honour of making mr. bounderbyâ€™s breakfast, before
mrs. gradgrindâ€”she begged pardon, she meant to say miss bounderbyâ€”she
hoped to be excused, but she really could not get it right yet, though
she trusted to become familiar with it by and byâ€”had assumed her present
position.  it was only (she observed) because miss gradgrind happened to
be a little late, and mr. bounderbyâ€™s time was so very precious, and she
knew it of old to be so essential that he should breakfast to the moment,
that she had taken the liberty of complying with his request; long as his
will had been a law to her.

â€˜there!  stop where you are, maâ€™am,â€™ said mr. bounderby, â€˜stop where you

â€˜why should it be of any importance to any one, mrs. sparsit, maâ€™am?â€™
said mr. bounderby, swelling with a sense of slight.  â€˜you attach too
much importance to these things, maâ€™am.  by george, youâ€™ll be corrupted
in some of your notions here.  you are old-fashioned, maâ€™am.  you are
behind tom gradgrindâ€™s childrenâ€™s time.â€™

straightforward man, i believe.  i donâ€™t go beating about for

al-pits, with an
express from stone lodge.  it was a hasty note to inform louisa that mrs.
gradgrind lay very ill.  she had never been well within her daughterâ€™s
knowledge; but, she had declined within the last few days, had continued
sinking all through the night, and was now as nearly dead, as her limited
capacity of being in any state that implied the ghost of an intention to
get out of it, allowed.

accompanied by the lightest of porters, fit colourless servitor at
deathâ€™s door when mrs. gradgrind knocked, louisa rumbled to coketown,
over the coal-pits past and present, and was whirled into its smoky jaws.
she dismissed the messenger to his own devices, and rode away to her old
home.

she had seldom been there since her marriage.  her father was usually
sifting and sifting at his parliamentary cinder-heap in london (without
being observed to turn up many precious articles among the rubbish), and
was still hard at it in the national dust-yard.  her mother had taken it

she went, with a heavy, hardened kind of sorrow upon her, into the house
and into her motherâ€™s room.  since the time of her leaving home, sissy
had lived with the rest of the family on equal terms.  sissy was at her
motherâ€™s side; and jane, her sister, now ten or twelve years old, was in
the room.

there was great trouble before it could be made known to mrs. gradgrind
that her eldest child was there.  she reclined, propped up, from mere
habit, on a couch: as nearly in her old usual attitude, as anything so
helpless could be kept in.  she had positively refused to take to her
bed; on the ground that if she did, she would never hear the last of it.

her feeble voice sounded so far away in her bundle of shawls, and the
sound of another voice addressing her seemed to take such a long time in
getting down to her ears, that she might have been lying at the bottom

cross-purposes, that she had never called him by that name since he
married louisa; that pending her choice of an objectionable name, she had
called him j; and that she could not at present depart from that
regulation, not being yet provided with a permanent substitute.  louisa
had sat by her for some minutes, and had spoken to her often, before she
arrived at a clear understanding who it was.  she then seemed to come to
it all at once.

â€˜well, my dear,â€™ said mrs. gradgrind, â€˜and i hope you are going on
satisfactorily to yourself.  it was all your fatherâ€™s doing.  he set his
heart upon it.  and he ought to know.â€™

â€˜i want to hear of you, mother; not of myself.â€™

â€˜you want to hear of me, my dear?  thatâ€™s something new, i am sure, when
anybody wants to hear of me.  not at all well, louisa.  very faint and
giddy.â€™

â€˜are you in pain, dear mother?â€™

â€˜i think thereâ€™s a pain somewhere in the room,â€™ said mrs. gradgrind, â€˜but

after this strange speech, she lay silent for some time.  louisa, holding
her hand, could feel no pulse; but kissing it, could see a slight thin
thread of life in fluttering motion.

â€˜you very seldom see your sister,â€™ said mrs. gradgrind.  â€˜she grows like
you.  i wish you would look at her.  sissy, bring her here.â€™

she was brought, and stood with her hand in her sisterâ€™s.  louisa had
observed her with her arm round sissyâ€™s neck, and she felt the difference
of this approach.

â€˜do you see the likeness, louisa?â€™

â€˜yes, mother.  i should think her like me.  butâ€”â€™

â€˜eh!  yes, i always say so,â€™ mrs. gradgrind cried, with unexpected
quickness.  â€˜and that reminds me.  iâ€”i want to speak to you, my dear.

the last fall, as for the ripeness and fulness of the harvest of her
hopes.  hushed in expectancy, she kept her wary gaze upon the stairs; and
seldom so much as darkly shook her right mitten (with her fist in it), at
the figure coming down.

the figure descended the great stairs, steadily, steadily; always
verging, like a weight in deep water, to the black gulf at the bottom.

mr. gradgrind, apprised of his wifeâ€™s decease, made an expedition from
london, and buried her in a business-like manner.  he then returned with
promptitude to the national cinder-heap, and resumed his sifting for the
odds and ends he wanted, and his throwing of the dust about into the eyes
of other people who wanted other odds and endsâ€”in fact resumed his
parliamentary duties.

in the meantime, mrs. sparsit kept unwinking watch and ward.  separated

â€˜well, maâ€™am, then you must get on in my absence as well as you can,â€™
said mr. bounderby, not displeased.

â€˜mr. bounderby,â€™ retorted mrs. sparsit, â€˜your will is to me a law, sir;
otherwise, it might be my inclination to dispute your kind commands, not
feeling sure that it will be quite so agreeable to miss gradgrind to
receive me, as it ever is to your own munificent hospitality.  but you

eyes, â€˜i should hope you want no other invitation.â€™

the national dustmen, after entertaining one another with a great many
noisy little fights among themselves, had dispersed for the present, and
mr. gradgrind was at home for the vacation.

he sat writing in the room with the deadly statistical clock, proving
something no doubtâ€”probably, in the main, that the good samaritan was a
bad economist.  the noise of the rain did not disturb him much; but it
attracted his attention sufficiently to make him raise his head
sometimes, as if he were rather remonstrating with the elements.  when it
thundered very loudly, he glanced towards coketown, having it in his mind

he might have added more than all, when he saw the face now looking at
him.  he did add it in effect, perhaps, as he softly moved her scattered
hair from her forehead with his hand.  such little actions, slight in
another man, were very noticeable in him; and his daughter received them
as if they had been words of contrition.

â€˜but,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, slowly, and with hesitation, as well as with a
wretched sense of happiness, â€˜if i see reason to mistrust myself for the
past, louisa, i should also mistrust myself for the present and the
future.  to speak unreservedly to you, i do.  i am far from feeling

sinking, with a resigned air, on the sofa, after standing transfixed a
little while.  â€˜the defeat may now be considered perfectly accomplished.

regarded as a classical ruin, mrs. sparsit was an interesting spectacle
on her arrival at her journeyâ€™s end; but considered in any other light,
the amount of damage she had by that time sustained was excessive, and
impaired her claims to admiration.  utterly heedless of the wear and tear
of her clothes and constitution, and adamant to her pathetic sneezes, mr.
bounderby immediately crammed her into a coach, and bore her off to stone
lodge.

â€˜now, tom gradgrind,â€™ said bounderby, bursting into his father-in-lawâ€™s
room late at night; â€˜hereâ€™s a lady hereâ€”mrs. sparsitâ€”you know mrs.
sparsitâ€”who has something to say to you that will strike you dumb.â€™

â€˜you have missed my letter!â€™ exclaimed mr. gradgrind, surprised by the
apparition.

â€˜missed your letter, sir!â€™ bawled bounderby.  â€˜the present time is no
time for letters.  no man shall talk to josiah bounderby of coketown
about letters, with his mind in the state itâ€™s in now.â€™

times with great vehemence on the table, â€˜i speak of a very special
messenger that has come to me, in reference to louisa.  mrs. sparsit,

so aggravating and underwent so many facial contortions, that mr.

totally inaudible, and seemingly swallowing marbles.  tom gradgrind, mrs.
sparsit latterly found herself, by accident, in a situation to overhear a
conversation out of doors between your daughter and your precious
gentleman-friend, mr. james harthouse.â€™

â€˜indeed!â€™ said mr. gradgrind.

â€˜ah!  indeed!â€™ cried bounderby.  â€˜and in that conversationâ€”â€™

â€˜it is not necessary to repeat its tenor, bounderby.  i know what
passed.â€™

â€˜you do?  perhaps,â€™ said bounderby, staring with all his might at his so
quiet and assuasive father-in-law, â€˜you know where your daughter is at
the present time!â€™

â€˜undoubtedly.  she is here.â€™

these words, mr. bounderby extended his right hand to the weeping lady,
and escorted her to the conveyance in question, shedding many plaintive
sneezes by the way.  he soon returned alone.

â€˜now, as you showed me in your face, tom gradgrind, that you wanted to

mr. gradgrind, it will be observed, being much softened, mr. bounderby

â€˜now, youâ€™ll excuse me,â€™ said bounderby, â€˜but i donâ€™t want to be too

be difficult of general application to girls.â€™

of a fit.  with his very ears a bright purple shot with crimson, he pent
up his indignation, however, and said:

â€˜youâ€™d like to keep her here for a time?â€™

â€˜iâ€”i had intended to recommend, my dear bounderby, that you should allow
louisa to remain here on a visit, and be attended by sissy (i mean of
course cecilia jupe), who understands her, and in whom she trusts.â€™

â€˜i gather from all this, tom gradgrind,â€™ said bounderby, standing up with
his hands in his pockets, â€˜that you are of opinion that thereâ€™s what
people call some incompatibility between loo bounderby and myself.â€™

â€˜i fear there is at present a general incompatibility between louisa,
andâ€”andâ€”and almost all the relations in which i have placed her,â€™ was her
fatherâ€™s sorrowful reply.

â€˜now, look you here, tom gradgrind,â€™ said bounderby the flushed,
confronting him with his legs wide apart, his hands deeper in his

â€˜bounderby,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, â€˜i hoped, after my entreaty, you would
have taken a different tone.â€™

â€˜just wait a bit,â€™ retorted bounderby; â€˜you have said your say, i

you, between your daughter and me.  iâ€™ll give _you_ to understand, in
reply to that, that there unquestionably is an incompatibility of the
first magnitudeâ€”to be summed up in thisâ€”that your daughter donâ€™t properly
know her husbandâ€™s merits, and is not impressed with such a sense as
would become her, by george! of the honour of his alliance.  thatâ€™s plain
speaking, i hope.â€™

â€˜bounderby,â€™ urged mr. gradgrind, â€˜this is unreasonable.â€™

â€˜is it?â€™ said bounderby.  â€˜i am glad to hear you say so.  because when
tom gradgrind, with his new lights, tells me that what i say is
unreasonable, i am convinced at once it must be devilish sensible.  with
your permission i am going on.  you know my origin; and you know that for
a good many years of my life i didnâ€™t want a shoeing-horn, in consequence
of not having a shoe.  yet you may believe or not, as you think proper,
that there are ladiesâ€”born ladi

he discharged this like a rocket, at his father-in-lawâ€™s head.

â€˜whereas your daughter,â€™ proceeded bounderby, â€˜is far from being a born
lady.  that you know, yourself.  not that i care a pinch of candle-snuff
about such things, for you are very well aware i donâ€™t; but that such is
the fact, and you, tom gradgrind, canâ€™t change it.  why do i say this?â€™

â€˜not, i fear,â€™ observed mr. gradgrind, in a low voice, â€˜to spare me.â€™

â€˜hear me out,â€™ said bounderby, â€˜and refrain from cutting in till your
turn comes round.  i say this, because highly connected females have been
astonished to see the way in which your daughter has conducted herself,
and to witness her insensibility.  they have wondered how i have suffered
it.  and i wonder myself now, and i wonâ€™t suffer it.â€™

question that may shorten the business.  what do you mean by the proposal
you made just now?â€™

â€˜what do i mean, bounderby?â€™

â€˜i was merely going on to remark, bounderby, that we may all be more or
less in the wrong, not even excepting you; and that some yielding on your
part, remembering the trust you have accepted, may not only be an act of
true kindness, but perhaps a debt incurred towards louisa.â€™

â€˜i think differently,â€™ blustered bounderby.  â€˜i am going to finish this
business according to my own opinions.  now, i donâ€™t want to make a
quarrel of it with you, tom gradgrind.  to tell you the truth, i donâ€™t
think it would be worthy of my reputation to quarrel on such a subject.
as to your gentleman-friend, he may take himself off, wherever he likes

oâ€™clock at noon, i shall unde

charge of her for the future.  what i shall say to people in general, of
the incompatibility that led to my so laying down the law, will be this.
i am josiah bounderby, and i had my bringing-up; sheâ€™s the daughter of
tom gradgrind, and she had her bringing-up; and the two horses wouldnâ€™t
pull together.  i am pretty well known to be rather an uncommon man, i
believe; and most people will understand fast enough that it must be a
woman rather out of the common, also, who, in the long run, would come up
to my mark.â€™

â€˜let me seriously entreat you to reconsider this, bounderby,â€™ urged mr.
gradgrind, â€˜before you commit yourself to such a decision.â€™

â€˜i always come to a decision,â€™ said bounderby, tossing his hat

 on: â€˜and
whatever i do, i do at once.  i should be surprised at tom gradgrindâ€™s
addressing such a remark to josiah bounderby of coketown, knowing what he

after his making himself a party to sentimental humbug.  i have given you
my decision, and i have got no more to say.  good night!â€™

so mr. bounderby went home to his town house to bed.  at five minutes
past twelve oâ€™clock next day, he directed mrs. bounderbyâ€™s property to be
carefully packed up and sent to tom gradgrindâ€™s; advertised his country
retreat for sale by private contract; and resumed a bachelor life.

for a reason that will explain itself.  shall they come in here?â€™

as he answered in the affirmative, sissy went away to bring them.  she
reappeared with them directly.  tom was last; and remained standing in
the obscurest part of the room, near the door.

â€˜mrs. bounderby,â€™ said her husband, entering with a cool nod, â€˜i donâ€™t
disturb you, i hope.  this is an unseasonable hour, but here is a young
woman who has been making statements which render my visit necessary.
tom gradgrind, as your son, young tom, refuses for some obstinate reason
or other to say anything at all about those statements, good or bad, i am
obliged to confront her with your daughter.â€™

â€˜you have seen me once before, young lady,â€™ said rachael, standing in
front of louisa.

tom coughed.

â€˜you have seen me, young lady,â€™ repeated rachael, as she did not answer,
â€˜once before.â€™

tom coughed again.

â€˜i have.â€™

rachael cast her eyes proudly towards mr. bounderby, and said, â€˜will you

thereâ€™s an end of it.  i wish you good night all!  i must be off to look
a little further into this.â€™

tom came out of his corner when mr. bounderby moved, moved with him, kept
close to him, and went away with him.  the only parting salutation of
which he delivered himself was a sulky â€˜good night, father!â€™  with a
brief speech, and a scowl at his sister, he left the house.

since his sheet-anchor had come home, mr. gradgrind had been sparing of
speech.  he still sat silent, when louisa mildly said:

â€˜rachael, you will not distrust me one day, when you know me better.â€™

â€˜it goes against me,â€™ rachael answered, in a gentler manner, â€˜to mistrust
any one; but when i am so mistrustedâ€”when we all areâ€”i cannot keep such
things quite out of my mind.  i ask your pardon for having done you an
injury.  i donâ€™t think what i said now.  yet i might come to think it
again, wiâ€™ the poor lad so wronged.â€™

sissy had already been at her side asking her where she lived, and
whether she might come to-morrow night, to inquire if there were news of
him.

â€˜i doubt,â€™ said rachael, â€˜if he can be here till next day.â€™

â€˜then i will come next night too,â€™ said sissy.

when rachael, assenting to this, was gone, mr. gradgrind lifted up his
head, and said to his daughter:

â€˜louisa, my dear, i have never, that i know of, seen this man.  do you
believe him to be implicated?â€™

â€˜i think i have believed it, father, though with great difficulty.  i do
not believe it now.â€™

â€˜that is to say, you once persuaded yourself to believe it, from knowing
him to be suspected.  his appearance and manner; are they so honest?â€™

â€˜very honest.â€™

â€˜and her confidence not to be shaken!  i ask myself,â€™ said mr. gradgrind,

louisa put her finger on her lip.

next night, when sissy returned home and told louisa that stephen was not
come, she told it in a whisper.  next night again, when she came home
with the same account, and added that he had not been heard of, she spoke
in the same low frightened tone.  from the moment of that interchange of
looks, they never uttered his name, or any reference to him, aloud; nor
ever pursued the subject of the robbery, when mr. gradgrind spoke of it.

the two appointed days ran out, three days and nights ran out, and
stephen blackpool was not come, and remained unheard of.  on the fourth
day, rachael, with unabated confidence, but considering her despatch to
have miscarried, went up to the bank, and showed her letter from him with
his address, at a working colony, one of many, not upon the main road,
sixty miles away.  messengers were sent to that place, and the whole town
looked for stephen to be brought in next day.

â€˜itâ€™s mrs. pegler,â€™ said rachael.

â€˜i should think it is!â€™ cried mrs. sparsit, exulting.  â€˜fetch mr.
bounderby.  stand away, everybody!â€™  here old mrs. pegler, muffling
herself up, and shrinking from observation, whispered a word of entreaty.
â€˜donâ€™t tell me,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, aloud.  â€˜i have told you twenty
times, coming along, that i will _not_ leave you till i have handed you
over to him myself.â€™

mr. bounderby now appeared, accompanied by mr. gradgrind and the whelp,
with whom he had been holding conference up-stairs.  mr. bounderby looked
more astonished than hospitable, at sight of this uninvited party in his
dining-room.

â€˜why, whatâ€™s the matter now!â€™ said he.  â€˜mrs. sparsit, maâ€™am?â€™

â€˜sir,â€™ explained that worthy woman, â€˜i trust it is my good fortune to

at each succeeding syllable became more and more round-eyed.  mr.
bounderby still walking up and down when mrs. pegler had done, mr.
gradgrind addressed that maligned old lady:

â€˜i am surprised, madam,â€™ he observed with severity, â€˜that in your old age
you have the face to claim mr. bounderby for your son, after your
unnatural and inhuman treatment of him.â€™

â€˜_me_ unnatural!â€™ cried poor old mrs. pegler.  â€˜_me_ inhuman!  to my dear
boy?â€™

â€˜dear!â€™ repeated mr. gradgrind.  â€˜yes; dear in his self-made prosperity,
madam, i dare say.  not very dear, however, when you deserted him in his
infancy, and left him to the brutality of a drunken grandmother.â€™

â€˜_i_ deserted my josiah!â€™ cried mrs. pegler, clasping her hands.  â€˜now,
lord forgive you, sir, for your wicked imaginations, and for your scandal
against the memory of my poor mother, who died in my arms before josiah
was born.  may you repent of it, sir, and live to know better!â€™

possibility which dawned upon him, said in a gentler tone:

â€˜do you deny, then, madam, that you left your son toâ€”to be brought up in

â€˜josiah in the gutter!â€™ exclaimed mrs. pegler.  â€˜no such a thing, sir.
never!  for shame on you!  my dear boy knows, and will give _you_ to
know, that though he come of humble parents, he come of parents that
loved him as dear as the best could, and never thought it hardship on
themselves to pinch a bit that he might write

ashamed of you, sir,â€™ said mrs. pegler, lastly, â€˜for your slanders and
suspicions.  and i never stood here before, nor never wanted to stand
here when my dear son said no.  and i shouldnâ€™t be here now, if it hadnâ€™t
been for being brought here.  and for shame upon you, oh, for shame, to
accuse me of being a bad mother to my son, with my son standing here to
tell you so different!â€™

the bystanders, on and off the dining-room chairs, raised a murmur of
sympathy with mrs. pegler, and mr. gradgrind felt himself innocently
placed in a very distressing predicament, when mr. bounderby, who had
never ceased walking up and down, and had every moment swelled larger and
larger, and grown redder and redder, stopped short.

â€˜i donâ€™t exactly know,â€™ said mr. bounderby, â€˜how i come to be favoured
with the attendance of the present company, but i donâ€™t inquire.  when
theyâ€™re quite satisfied, perhaps theyâ€™ll be so good as to disperse;
whether theyâ€™re satisfied or not, perhaps theyâ€™ll

be so good as to
disperse.  iâ€™m not bound to deliver a lecture on my family affairs, i
have not undertaken to do it, and iâ€™m not a going to do it.  therefore
those who expect any explanation whatever upon that branch of the
subject, will be disappointedâ€”particularly tom gradgrind, and he canâ€™t
know it too soon.  in reference to the bank robbery, there has been a
mistake made, concerning my mother.  if there hadnâ€™t been
over-officiousness it wouldnâ€™t have been made, and i hate
over-officiousness at all times, whether or no. good evening!â€™

although mr. bounderby carried it off in these terms, holding the door
open for the company to depart, there was a blustering sheepishness upon
him, at once extremely crestfallen and superlatively absurd.  detected as
the bully

to the whole
town, to be given to the four winds, he could not have looked a bully
more shorn and forlorn, if he had had his ears cropped.  even that
unlucky female, mrs. sparsit, fallen from her pinnacle of exultation into
the slough of despond, was not in so bad a plight as that remarkable man
and self-made humbug, josiah bounderby of coketown.

rachael and sissy, leaving mrs. pegler to occupy a bed at her sonâ€™s for
that night, walked together to the gate of stone lodge and there parted.
mr. gradgrind joined them before they had gone very far, and spoke with
much interest of stephen blackpool; for whom he thought this signal
failure of the suspicions against mrs. pegler was likely to work well.

as to the whelp; throughout this scene as on all other late occasions, he
had stuck close to bounderby.  he seemed to feel that as long as
bounderby could make no discovery without his knowledge, he was so far
safe.  he never visited his sister, and had only seen her once since she
went home: that is

among the people that the man would be found alive was very slight
indeed.

there being now people enough present to impede the work, the sobered man
put himself at the head of the rest, or was put there by the general
consent, and made a large ring round the old hell shaft, and appointed
men to keep it.  besides such volunteers as were accepted to work, only
sissy and rachael were at first permitted within this ring; but, later in
the day, when the message brought an express from coketown, mr. gradgrind
and louisa, and mr. bounderby, and the whelp, were also there.

the sun was four hours lower than when sissy and rachael had first sat
down upon the grass, before a means of enabling two men to descend
securely was rigged with poles and ropes.  difficulties had arisen in the
construction of this machine, simple as it was; requisites had been found
wanting, and messages had had to go and return.  it was five oâ€™clock in
the afternoon of the bright autumnal sunday, before a candle was sent

â€˜yes, stephen, i have heard you.  and your prayer is mine.â€™

â€˜you haâ€™ a father.  will yo takâ€™ a message to him?â€™

â€˜he is here,â€™ said louisa, with dread.  â€˜shall i bring him to you?â€™

â€˜if yo please.â€™

louisa returned with her father.  standing hand-in-hand, they both looked
down upon the solemn countenance.

â€˜sir, yo will clear me anâ€™ mak my name good wiâ€™ aw men.  this i leave to
yo.â€™

mr. gradgrind was troubled and asked how?

â€˜sir,â€™ was the reply: â€˜yor son will tell yo how.  ask him.  i mak no
charges: i leave none ahint me: not a single word.  i haâ€™ seen anâ€™ spokâ€™n

the bearers being now ready to carry him away, and the surgeon being
anxious for his removal, those who had torches or lanterns, prepared to
go in front of the litter.  before it was raised, and while they

procession.  the star had shown him where to find the god of the poor;
and through humility, and sorrow, and forgiveness, he had gone to his
redeemerâ€™s rest.



chapter vii
whelp-hunting


before the ring formed round the old hell shaft was broken, one figure
had disappeared from within it.  mr. bounderby and his shadow had not
stood near louisa, who held her fatherâ€™s arm, but in a retired place by
themselves.  when mr. gradgrind was summoned to the couch, sissy,
attentive to all that happened, slipped behind that wicked shadowâ€”a sight
in the horror of his face, if there had been eyes there for any sight but
oneâ€”and whispered in his ear.  without turning his head, he conferred
with her a few moments, and vanished.  thus the whelp had gone out of the
circle before the people moved.

when the father reached home, he sent a message to mr. bounderbyâ€™s,
desiring his son to come to him directly.  the reply was, that mr.

bounderby having missed him in the crowd, and seeing nothing of him
since, had supposed him to be at stone lodge.

â€˜i believe, father,â€™ said louisa, â€˜he will not come back to town
to-night.â€™  mr. gradgrind turned away, and said no more.

in the morning, he went down to the bank himself as soon as it was
opened, and seeing his sonâ€™s place empty (he had not the courage to look
in at first) went back along the street to meet mr. bounderby on his way
there.  to whom he said that, for reasons he would soon explain, but
entreated not then to be asked for, he had found it necessary to employ
his son at a distance for a little while.  also, that he was charged with
the duty of vindicating stephen black

poolâ€™s memory, and declaring the
thief.  mr. bounderby quite confounded, stood stock-still in the street
after his father-in-law had left him, swelling like an immense
soap-bubble, without its beauty.

mr. gradgrind went home, locked himself in his room, and kept it all that
day.  when sissy and louisa tapped at his door, he said, without opening
it, â€˜not now, my dears; in the evening.â€™  on their return in the evening,
he said, â€˜i am not able yetâ€”to-morrow.â€™  he ate nothing all day, and had
no candle after dark; and they heard him walking to and fro late at
night.

but, in the morning he appeared at breakfast at the usual hour, and took
his usual place at the table.  aged and bent he looked, and 
 
 ___________________________
 
 a wiser man, and a better man, than in the days
when in this life he wanted nothingâ€”but facts.  before he left the room,
he appointed a time for them to come to him; and so, with his gray head
drooping, went away.

â€˜dear father,â€™ said louisa, when they kept their appointment, â€˜you have
three young children left.  they will be different, i will be different
yet, with heavenâ€™s help.â€™

she gave her hand to sissy, as if she meant with her help too.

â€˜your wretched brother,â€™ said mr. gradgrind.  â€˜do you think he had
planned this robbery, when he went with you to the lodging?â€™

â€˜i fear so, father.  i know he had wanted money very much, and had spent
a great deal.â€™

â€˜the poor man being about to leave the town, it came into his evil brain
to cast suspicion on him?â€™

â€˜i think it must have flashed upon him while he sat there, father.  for i
asked him to go there with me.  the visit did not originate with him.â€™

â€˜he had some conversation with the poor man.  did he take hi

is intentions should be
mistrusted, or the intelligence of his arrival should cause his son to
take flight anew; but, that the communication should be left to sissy and
louisa to open; and that they should inform the cause of so much misery
and disgrace, of his fatherâ€™s being at hand and of the purpose for which
they had come.  when these arrangements had been well considered and were
fully understood by all three, it was time to begin to carry them into
execution.  early in the afternoon, mr. gradgrind walked direct from his
own house into the country, to be taken up on the line by which he was to
travel; and at night the remaining two set forth upon their different
course, encouraged by not seeing any face they knew.

the two travelled all night, except when they were left, for odd numbers
of minutes, at branch-places, up illimitable flights of steps, or down
wellsâ€”which was the only variety of those branchesâ€”and, early in the
morning, were turned out on a swamp, a mile or two from the t

louisa, with many thanks and with a lightened load, detained mr. sleary
no longer then.  she left her love for her brother, with her eyes full of
tears; and she and sissy went away until later in the afternoon.

mr. gradgrind arrived within an hour afterwards.  he too had encountered
no one whom he knew; and was now sanguine with slearyâ€™s assistance, of
getting his disgraced son to liverpool in the night.  as neither of the
three could be his companion without almost identifying him under any
disguise, he prepared a letter to a correspondent whom he could trust,
beseeching him to ship the bearer off at any cost, to north or south
america, or any distant part of the world to which he could be the most
speedily and

they walked about, waiting for the circus to be quite vacated;
not only by the audience, but by the company and by the horses.  after
watching it a long time, they saw mr. sleary bring out a chair and sit
down by the side-door, smoking; as if that were his signal that they
might approach.

â€˜your thervant, thquire,â€™ was his cautious salutation as they passed in.
â€˜if you want me youâ€™ll find me here.  you muthnâ€™t mind your thon having a
comic livery on.â€™

they all three went in; and mr. gradgrind sat down forlorn, on the
clownâ€™s performing chair in the middle of the ring.  on one of the back
benches, remote in the subdued light and the strangeness of the place,
sat the villainous whelp, sulky to the last, whom he had the misery to
call his son.

in a preposterous coat, like a beadleâ€™s, with cuffs and flaps exaggerated
to an unspeakable extent; in an immense waistcoat, knee-breeches, buckled
shoes, and a mad cocked hat; with nothing fitting him, and everything of
coarse material, mot

h-eaten and full of holes; with seams in his black
face, where fear and heat had started through the greasy composition
daubed all over it; anything so grimly, detestably, ridiculously shameful
as the whelp in his comic livery, mr. gradgrind never could by any other
means have believed in, weighable and measurable fact though it was.  and
one of his model children had come to this!

at first the whelp would not draw any nearer, but persisted in remaining
up there by himself.  yielding at length, if any concession so sullenly
made can be called yielding, to the entreaties of sissyâ€”for louisa he
disowned altogetherâ€”he came down, bench by bench, until he stood in the
sawdust, on the verge of the circle, as far as possible, within

ooking like the hands of a monkey.  the evening was
fast closing in; and from time to time, he turned the whites of his eyes
restlessly and impatiently towards his father.  they were the only parts
of his face that showed any life or expression, the pigment upon it was
so thick.

â€˜you must be got to liverpool, and sent abroad.â€™

â€˜i suppose i must.  i canâ€™t be more miserable anywhere,â€™ whimpered the
whelp, â€˜than i have been here, ever since i can remember.  thatâ€™s one
thing.â€™

mr. gradgrind went to the door, and returned with sleary, to whom he
submitted the question, how to get this deplorable object away?

â€˜why, iâ€™ve been thinking of it, thquire.  thereâ€™th not muth time to
lothe, tho you muth thay yeth or no.  ith over twenty mileth to the rail.

minutes.â€™

â€˜i donâ€™t understand,â€™ said mr. gradgrind.

â€˜a jothkinâ€”a carter.  make up your mind quick, thquire.  thereâ€™ll be beer
to feth.  iâ€™ve never met with nothing but beer athâ€™ll ever clean a comic
blackamoor.â€™

mr. gradgrind rapidly assented; mr. sleary rapidly turned out from a box,
a smock frock, a felt hat, and other essentials; the whelp rapidly
changed clothes behind a screen of baize; mr. sleary rapidly brought
beer, and washed him white again.

â€˜now,â€™ said sleary, â€˜come along to the coath, and jump up behind; iâ€™ll go
with you there, and theyâ€™ll thuppothe you one of my people.  thay
farewell to your family, and tharpâ€™th the word.â€™  with which he
delicately retired.

the culprit was moved to a few abject tears by these words and their
pathetic tone.  but, when louisa opened her arms, he repulsed her afresh.

â€˜not you.  i donâ€™t want to have anything to say to you!â€™

â€˜o tom, tom, do we end so, afte

saw the net was gathering round me.  pretty love that!  you have

â€˜tharpâ€™th the word!â€™ said sleary, at the door.

they all confusedly went out: louisa crying to him that she forgave him,
and loved him still, and that he would one day be sorry to have left her
so, and glad to think of these her last words, far away: when some one
ran against them.  mr. gradgrind and sissy, who were both before him
while his sister yet clung to his shoulder, stopped and recoiled.

for, there was bitzer, out of breath, his thin lips parted, his thin
nostrils distended, his white eyelashes quivering, his colourless face
more colourless than ever, as if he ran himself into a white heat, when
other people ran themselves into a glow.  there he stood, panting and
heaving, as if he had never stopped since the night, now long ago, when
he had run them down before.

by the collar, too, it seemed.  for, so he took possession of him.

they went back into the booth, sleary shutting the door to keep intruders
out.  bitzer, still holding the paralysed culprit by the collar, stood in
the ring, blinking at his old patron through the darkness of the
twilight.

â€˜bitzer,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, broken down, and miserably submissive to
him, â€˜have you a heart?â€™

â€˜the circulation, sir,â€™ returned bitzer, smiling at the oddity of the
question, â€˜couldnâ€™t be carried on without one.  no man, sir, acquainted
with the facts established by harvey relating to the circulation of the
blood, can doubt that i have a heart.â€™

â€˜is it accessible,â€™ cried mr. gradgrind, â€˜to any compassionate
influence?â€™

â€˜it is accessible to reason, sir,â€™ returned the excellent young man.
â€˜and

 to nothing else.â€™

they stood looking at each other; mr. gradgrindâ€™s face as white as the
pursuerâ€™s.

â€˜what motiveâ€”even what motive in reasonâ€”can you have for preventing the
escape of this wretched youth,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, â€˜and crushing his
miserable father?  see his sister here.  pity us!â€™

â€˜sir,â€™ returned bitzer, in a very business-like and logical manner,
â€˜since you ask me what motive i have in reason, for taking young mr. tom
back to coketown, it is only reasonable to let you know.  i have
suspected young mr. tom of this bank-robbery from the first.  i had had
my eye upon him before that time, for i knew his ways.  i have kept my
observations to myself, but i have made them; and i have got ample pr

confession, which i was just in time to overhear.  i had the pleasure of
watching your house yesterday morning, and following you here.  i am
going to take young mr. tom back to coketown, in order to deliver him
over to mr. bounderby.  sir, i have no doubt whatever that mr. bounderby
will then promote me to young mr. tomâ€™s situation.  and i wish to have
his situation, sir, for it will be a rise to me, and will do me good.â€™

â€˜if this is solely a question of self-interest with youâ€”â€™ mr. gradgrind
began.

â€˜i beg your pardon for interrupting you, sir,â€™ returned bitzer; â€˜but i am
sure you know that the whole social system is a question of
self-interest.  what you must always appeal to, is a personâ€™s
self-interest.  itâ€™s your only hold.  we are so constituted.  i was
brought up in that catechism when i was very young, sir, as you are
aware.â€™

â€˜what sum of money,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, â€˜will you set against your
expected promotion?â€™

â€˜thank you, sir,â€™ returned bitzer, â

€˜for hinting at the proposal; but i
will not set any sum against it.  knowing that your clear head would
propose that alternative, i have gone over the calculations in my mind;
and i find that to compound a felony, even on very high terms indeed,
would not be as safe and good for me as my improved prospects in the
bank.â€™

â€˜bitzer,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, stretching out his hands as though he would
have said, see how miserable i am!  â€˜bitzer, i have but one chance left
to soften you.  you were many years at my school.  if, in remembrance of
the pains bestowed upon you there, you can persuade yourself in any
degree to disregard your present interest and release my son, i entreat
and pray you to give him the benefit of that remembrance.â€™

â€˜i really wonder, sir,â€™ rejoined the old pupil in an argumentative
manner, â€˜to find you taking a po

sition so untenable.  my schooling was
paid for; it was a bargain; and when i came away, the bargain ended.â€™

it was a fundamental principle of the gradgrind philosophy that
everything was to be paid for.  nobody was ever on any account to give
anybody anything, or render anybody help without purchase.  gratitude was
to be abolished, and the virtues springing from it were not to be.  every
inch of the existence of mankind, from birth to death, was to be a
bargain across a counter.  and if we didnâ€™t get to heaven that way, it
was not a politico-economical place, and we had no business there.

â€˜i donâ€™t deny,â€™ added bitzer, â€˜that my schooling

fresh lamentations from louisa, and deeper affliction on mr. gradgrindâ€™s
part, followed this desertion of them by their last friend.  but, sissy
glanced at him with great attention; nor did she in her own breast
misunderstand him.  as they were all going out again, he favoured her
with one slight roll of his movable eye, desiring her to linger behind.
as he locked the door, he said excitedly:

mr. gradgrind overwhelmed him with thanks, of course; and hinted as
delicately as he could, at a handsome remuneration in money.

â€˜i donâ€™t want money mythelf, thquire; but childerth ith a family man, and
if you wath to like to offer him a five-pound note, it mightnâ€™t be

thquire, to make a little thpread for the company at about three and
thixth ahead, not reckoning luth, it would make â€™em happy.â€™

all these little tokens of his gratitude, mr. gradgrind very willingly
undertook to render.  though he thought them far too slight, he said, for
such a service.

â€˜very well, thquire; then, if youâ€™ll only give a horthe-riding, a
bethpeak, whenever you can, youâ€™ll more than balanthe the account.  now,
thquire, if your daughter will ethcuthe me, i thould like one parting
word with you.â€™

louisa and sissy withdrew into an adjoining room; mr. sleary, stirring
and drinking his brandy and water as he stood, went on:

â€˜thquire,â€”you donâ€™t need

sleary, â€˜it ith athtonithing.  the way in whith a dogâ€™ll find youâ€”the

â€˜his scent,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, â€˜being so fine.â€™

â€˜iâ€™m bletht if i know what to call it,â€™ repeated sleary, shaking his
head, â€˜but i have had dogth find me, thquire, in a way that made me think
whether that dog hadnâ€™t gone to another dog, and thed, â€œyou donâ€™t happen

mr. gradgrind seemed to be quite confounded by this speculation.

mr. gradgrind looked out of window, and made no reply.  mr. sleary
emptied his glass and recalled the ladies.

healthy stomachs, with a vast amount of bounderby balderdash and bluster?
had he any prescience of the day, five years to come, when josiah
bounderby of coketown was to die of a fit in the coketown street, and
this same precious will was to begin its long career of quibble, plunder,
false pretences, vile example, little service and much law?  probably
not.  yet the portrait was to see it all out.

here was mr. gradgrind on the same day, and in the same hour, sitting
thoughtful in his own room.  how much of futurity did _he_ see?  did he
see himself, a white-haired decrepit man, bending his hitherto inflexible
theories to appointed circumstances; making his facts and figures
subservient to faith, hope, and charity; and no longer trying to grind
that heavenly trio in his dusty little mills?  did he catch sight of
himself, therefore much despised by his late political associates?  did
he see them, in the era of i
