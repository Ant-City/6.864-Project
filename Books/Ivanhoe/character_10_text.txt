lady rowena had watched the progress of the day with equal attention,
though without openly betraying the same intense interest. even the
unmoved athelstane had shown symptoms of shaking off his apathy, when,
calling for a huge goblet of muscadine, he quaffed it to the health
of the disinherited knight. another group, stationed under the gallery
occupied by the saxons, had shown no less interest in the fate of the
day.

â€œfather abraham!â€ said isaac of york, when the first course was run
betwixt the templar and the disinherited knight, â€œhow fiercely that
gentile rides! ah, the good horse that was brought all the long way
from barbary, he takes no more care of him than if he were a wild assâ€™s

to the enquiries of athelstane and cedric, the old jew could for some
time only answer by invoking the protection of all the patriarchs of the
old testament successively against the sons of ishmael, who were coming
to smite them, hip and thigh, with the edge of the sword. when he began
to come to himself out of this agony of terror, isaac of york (for it
was our old friend) was at length able to explain, that he had hired
a body-guard of six men at ashby, together with mules for carrying the
litter of a sick friend. this party had undertaken to escort him as
far as doncaster. they had come thus far in safety; but having received
information from a wood-cutter that there was a strong band of outlaws
lying in wait in the woods before them, isaacâ€™s mercenaries had not only
taken flight, but had carried off with them the horses which bore

leaving the saxon chiefs to return to their banquet as soon as their
ungratified curiosity should permit them to attend to the calls of their
half-satiated appetite, we have to look in upon the yet more severe
imprisonment of isaac of york. the poor jew had been hastily thrust into
a dungeon-vault of the castle, the floor of which was deep beneath
the level of the ground, and very damp, being lower than even the moat
itself. the only light was received through one or two loop-holes far
above the reach of the captiveâ€™s hand. these apertures admitted, even
at mid-day, only a dim and uncertain light, which was changed for utter
darkness long before the rest of the castle had lost the blessing of
day. chains and shackles, which had

with the species of emotion with which her devoted knight had hitherto
gazed on the beautiful features, and fair form, and lustrous eyes, of
the lovely rebecca; eyes whose brilliancy was shaded, and, as it were,

eagle with my prey in my clutch.â€--and making his way through the ring,
amidst the laughter of all around, he appeared in majestic triumph, his
huge partisan in one hand, and in the other a halter, one end of which
was fastened to the neck of the unfortunate isaac of york, who, bent
down by sorrow and terror, was dragged on by the victorious priest, who
shouted aloud, â€œwhere is allan-a-dale, to chronicle me in a ballad, or

supposing i were to pay you fifty crowns.â€

â€œthe prior shall judge of that matter,â€ replied the captain.--â€œhow say
you, father aymer? can the jew afford a good ransom?â€

â€œcan he afford a ransom?â€ answered the prior â€œis he not isaac of york,
rich enough to redeem the captivity of the ten tribes of israel, who
were led into assyrian bondage?--i have seen but little of him myself,
but our cellarer and treasurer have dealt largely with him, and report
says that his house at york is so full of gold and silver as is a shame
in any christian land. marvel it is to all living christian hearts that
such gnawing adders should be suffered to eat into the bowels of the
state, and even of the holy church herself, with foul usuries and

mary refuse me, an i burn not the abbey over thine head, though i hang

with a much worse grace than that wherewith he had penned the letter to
bois-guilbert, the prior wrote an acquittance, discharging isaac of york
of six hundred crowns, advanced to him in his need for acquittal of his
ransom, and faithfully promising to hold true compt with him for that
sum.

â€œand now,â€ said prior aymer, â€œi will pray you of restitution of my mules
and palfreys, and the freedom of the reverend brethren attending upon
me, and also of the gymmal rings, jewels, and fair vestures, of which
i have been despoiled, having now satisfied you for my ransom as a true

our tale now returns to isaac of york.--mounted upon a mule, the gift of
the outlaw, with two tall yeomen to act as his guard and guides, the
jew had set out for the preceptory of templestowe, for the purpose of
negotiating his daughterâ€™s redemption. the preceptory was but a dayâ€™s
journey from the demolished castle of torquilstone, and the jew had
hoped to reach it before nightfall; accordingly, having dismissed his
guides at the verge of the forest, and rewarded them with a piece of
silver, he began to press on with such speed

earnest agitator, a murmurer, and a machinator, and a leader amongst
those who impugn our authority; not considering that the rule is given
to the master even by the symbol of the staff and the rod--the staff to
support the infirmities of the weak--the rod to correct the faults of
delinquents.--damian,â€ he continued, â€œlead the jew to our presence.â€

the squire departed with a profound reverence, and in a few minutes
returned, marshalling in isaac of york. no naked slave, ushered into the
presence of some mighty prince, could approach his judgment-seat with
more profound reverence and terror than that with which the jew drew
near to the presence of the grand master. when he had approached within
the distance of three yards, beaumanoir made a sign with his staff that
he should come no farther. the jew kneeled down on the earth which he
kissed in token of reverence; then rising, stood before the templars,
his hands folded on his bosom, his head bo

â€œhow comes it, then, i demand of thee once more, that thou hast suffered
a brother to bring a paramour, and that paramour a jewish sorceress,
into this holy place, to the stain and pollution thereof?â€

â€œa jewish sorceress!â€ echoed albert malvoisin; â€œgood angels guard us!â€

â€œay, brother, a jewish sorceress!â€ said the grand master, sternly. â€œi
have said it. darest thou deny that this rebecca, the daughter of that
wretched usurer isaac of york, and the pupil of the foul witch
miriam, is now--shame to be thought or spoken!--lodged within this thy
preceptory?â€

â€œyour wisdom, reverend father,â€ answered the preceptor, â€œhath rolled
away the darkness from my understanding. much did i wonder that so good

charms of this female, whom i received into this house merely to place a

in all such
chapters, it is our duty to hear the advice of our brethren, and to
proceed according to our own pleasure. but when the raging wolf hath
made an inroad upon the flock, and carried off one member thereof, it is
the duty of the kind shepherd to call his comrades together, that with
bows and slings they may quell the invader, according to our well-known
rule, that the lion is ever to be beaten down. we have therefore
summoned to our presence a jewish woman, by name rebecca, daughter
of isaac of york--a woman infamous for sortileges and for witcheries;
whereby she hath maddened the blood, and besotted the brain, not of a
churl, but of a knight--not of a secular knight, but of one devoted
to the service of the holy temple--not of a knight companion, but of a
preceptor of our order, first in honour as in place. our brother, brian
de bois-guilbert, is well known to ourselves, and to all degrees who now
hear me, as a true and zealous champion of the cross, by whose arm many
deeds of valour have

n,â€ said beaumanoir, â€œyou are aware that we might well have
refused to this woman the benefit of the trial by combat--but though a
jewess and an unbeliever, she is also a stranger and defenceless, and
god forbid that she should ask the benefit of our mild laws, and that it
should be refused to her. moreover, we are knights and soldiers as well
as men of religion, and shame it were to us upon any pretence, to
refuse proffered combat. thus, therefore, stands the case. rebecca,
the daughter of isaac of york, is, by many frequent and suspicious
circumstances, defamed of sorcery practised on the person of a noble
knight of our holy order, and hath challenged the combat in proof of her
innocence. to whom, reverend brethren, is it your opinion that we should
deliver the gage of battle, naming him, at the same time, to be our
champion on the field?â€

one of the chaplains, who acted as clerks to the chapter, immediately
engrossed the order in a huge volume, which contained the proceedings of
the templar knights when solemnly assembled on such occasions; and when
he had finished writing, the other read aloud the sentence of the grand
master, which, when translated from the norman-french in which it was
couched, was expressed as follows.--

â€œrebecca, a jewess, daughter of isaac of york, being attainted of
sorcery, seduction, and other damnable practices, practised on a knight
of the most holy order of the temple of zion, doth deny the same; and
saith, that the testimony delivered against her this day is false,
wicked, and disloyal; and that by lawful â€˜essoineâ€™ [54] of her body as
being unable to combat in her own behalf, she doth offer, by a champion
instead thereof, to avouch her case, he performing his loyal â€˜devoirâ€™ in
all knightly sort, with such arms as to gage o

to peril his soul.

â€œi will get me,â€ he said, â€œmy neighbour buthanâ€™s good capul, [55] and i
will be at york within as brief space as man and beast may.â€

but as it fortuned, he had no occasion to go so far, for within a
quarter of a mile from the gate of the preceptory he met with two
riders, whom, by their dress and their huge yellow caps, he knew to be
jews; and, on approaching more nearly, discovered that one of them was
his ancient employer, isaac of york. the other was the rabbi ben samuel;
and both had approached as near to the preceptory as they dared, on
hearing that the grand master had summoned a chapter for the trial of a
sorceress.

â€œbrother ben samuel,â€ said isaac, â€œmy soul is disquieted, and i wot not
why. this charge of necromancy is right often used for cloaking evil
practices on our people.â€

may yet find out a way of deliverance.â€

â€œdo thou read, brother,â€ answered isaac, â€œfor mine eyes are as a

the physician read, but in their native language, the following words:--

peace and the blessing of the promise be multiplied unto thee!--my
father, i am as one doomed to die for that which my soul knoweth
not--even for the crime of witchcraft. my father, if a strong man can be
found to do battle for my cause with sword and spear, according to the
custom of the nazarenes, and that within the lists of templestowe, on

purpose, the stranger knight answered readily and boldly, â€œi am a good

and lawful quarrel of this damsel, rebecca, daughter of isaac of york;
