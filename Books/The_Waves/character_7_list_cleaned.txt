[CHARACTER] - 
one of the narrators. [CHARACTER] hates city life and cannot wait to return
home from school to her family farm, where she wants to tend the land and raise
children. [CHARACTER] is an earthy, passionate woman who is highly compelling to men,
though not as classically beautiful as jinny. [CHARACTER] has an intense relationship
with the land and with nature, but her cultivation of this natural bond leads to
the suppression of many of her other desires. [CHARACTER] loves bernard, for example,
but sacrifices any passion of her own for the sake of her family and her place
in the cycle of rural life.
