Lorraine Quarrles - 
                A thirty-year-old blonde American woman. Lorraine is a figure from Charlie's debauched past. She too has lost her fortune but hasn't stopped trying to live the way she did when she had money. Now a sad, almost pathetic figure, she chases after Charlie, whose newfound sobriety both amuses her and makes her jealous.
