rance,
    this fellow here, with envious carping tongue,
    upbraided me about the rose i wear,
    saying the sanguine colour of the leaves
    did represent my master's blushing cheeks
    when stubbornly he did repugn the truth
    about a certain question in the law
    argu'd betwixt the duke of york and him;
    with other vile and ignominious terms
    in confutation of which rude reproach
    and in defence of my lord's worthiness,
    i crave the benefit of law of arms.
  vernon. and that is my petition, noble lord;
    for though he seem with forged quaint conceit
    to set a gloss upon his bold intent,
    yet know, my lord, i was provok'd by him,
    and he first took exceptions at this badge,
    pronouncing that the paleness of this flower
    bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart.
  york. will not this malice, somerset, be left?
  somerset. your private grudge, my lord of york, will out,
    though ne'er so cunningly you smother it.

    such factious emulations shall arise!

  york. let this dissension first be tried by fight,
    and then your highness shall command a peace.

    betwixt ourselves let us decide it then.
  york. there is my pledge; accept it, somerset.

  gloucester. confirm it so? confounded be your strife;
