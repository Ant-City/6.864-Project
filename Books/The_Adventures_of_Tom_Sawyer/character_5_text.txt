 boys is having holiday, but he hates work more than he
hates anything else, and iï¿½ve _got_ to do some of my duty by him, or
iï¿½ll be the ruination of the child.ï¿½

tom did play hookey, and he had a very good time. he got back home
barely in season to help jim, the small colored boy, saw next-dayï¿½s wood
and split the kindlings before supper--at least he was there in time
to tell his adventures to jim while jim did three-fourths of the work.
tomï¿½s younger brother (or rather half-brother) sid was already through
with his part of the work (picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy,
and had no adventurous, trouble-some ways.

while tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity
offered, aunt polly asked him questions that were full of guile, and
very deep--for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments. like
many other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she
was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she
loved to contemplate

pump on your head, did you? unbutton your jacket!ï¿½

the trouble vanished out of tomï¿½s face. he opened his jacket. his shirt
collar was securely sewed.

ï¿½bother! well, go ï¿½long with you. iï¿½d made sure youï¿½d played hookey
and been a-swimming. but i forgive ye, tom. i reckon youï¿½re a kind of a
singed cat, as the saying is--betterï¿½n you look. _this_ time.ï¿½

she was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that tom
had stumbled into obedient conduct for once.

but sidney said:

ï¿½well, now, if i didnï¿½t think you sewed his collar with white thread,
but itï¿½s black.ï¿½

ï¿½why, i did sew it with white! tom!ï¿½

but tom did not wait for the rest. as he went out at the door he said:

ï¿½siddy, iï¿½ll lick you for that.ï¿½

in a safe place tom examined two large needles which were thrust into
the lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them--one needle
carried white thread and the other black. he said:

ï¿½sheï¿½d never noticed if it hadnï¿½t been fo

she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black. i wish to
gee-miny sheï¿½d stick to one or tï¿½other--i canï¿½t keep the run of ï¿½em. but
i bet you iï¿½ll lam sid for that. iï¿½ll learn him!ï¿½

he was not the model boy of the village. he knew the model boy very well
though--and loathed him.

within two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles. not
because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a
manï¿½s are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore
them down and drove them out of his mind for the time--just as menï¿½s
misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises. this new
interest was

astounding. his cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth
roundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons. he had shoes
on--and it was only friday. he even wore a necktie, a bright bit of
ribbon. he had a citified air about him that ate into tomï¿½s vitals. the
more tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his nose
at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to
him to grow. neither boy spoke. if one moved, the other moved--but only
sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all the
time. finally tom said:

ï¿½i can lick you!ï¿½

ï¿½iï¿½d like to see you try it.ï¿½

ï¿½well, i can do it.ï¿½

ï¿½no you canï¿½t, either.ï¿½

ï¿½yes i can.ï¿½

ï¿½no you canï¿½t.ï¿½

ï¿½i can.ï¿½

ï¿½you canï¿½t.ï¿½

ï¿½can!ï¿½

ï¿½canï¿½t!ï¿½

an uncomfortable pause. then tom said:

ï¿½whatï¿½s your name?ï¿½

ï¿½ï¿½tisnï¿½t any of your business, maybe.ï¿½

ï¿½well i ï¿½low iï¿½ll _make_ it my business.ï¿½

ï¿½well why donï¿½t you

ï¿½oh, of _course_ you will.ï¿½

ï¿½well i _will_.ï¿½

ï¿½well why donï¿½t you _do_ it then? what do you keep _saying_ you will
for? why donï¿½t you _do_ it? itï¿½s because youï¿½re afraid.ï¿½

ï¿½i _ainï¿½t_ afraid.ï¿½

ï¿½you are.ï¿½

ï¿½i ainï¿½t.ï¿½

ï¿½you are.ï¿½

another pause, and more eying and sidling around each other. presently
they were shoulder to shoulder. tom said:

ï¿½get away from here!ï¿½

ï¿½go away yourself!ï¿½

ï¿½i wonï¿½t.ï¿½

ï¿½i wonï¿½t either.ï¿½

so they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace, and both
shoving with might and main, and glowering at each other with hate. but
neither could get an advantage. after struggling till both were hot and
flushed, each relaxed his strain with watchful caution, and tom said:

ï¿½youï¿½re a coward and a pup. iï¿½ll te

and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and
threatening what he would do to tom the ï¿½next time he caught him out.ï¿½
 to which tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and
as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it
and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like
an antelope. tom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he
lived. he then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the
enemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through the
window and declined. at last the enemyï¿½s mother appeared, and called tom
a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. so he went away; but
he said he ï¿½ï¿½lowedï¿½ to ï¿½layï¿½ for that boy.

he got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed cautiously in
at the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt; and
when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his
saturday holiday into captivity a

ing was come, and all the summer world was bright and
fresh, and brimming with life. there was a song in every heart; and if
the heart was young the music issued at the lips. there was cheer in
every face and a spring in every step. the locust-trees were in bloom
and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. cardiff hill, beyond
the village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far
enough away to seem a delectable land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.

tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a
long-handled brush. he surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and
a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. thirty yards of board
fence nine feet high. life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a
burden. sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost
plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant
whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed
fence, and sat down on a tree-box discou

ï¿½_she_! she never licks anybody--whacks ï¿½em over the head with her
thimble--and who cares for that, iï¿½d like to know. she talks awful, but
talk donï¿½t hurt--anyways it donï¿½t if she donï¿½t cry. jim, iï¿½ll give you a
marvel. iï¿½ll give you a white alley!ï¿½

jim began to waver.

ï¿½white alley, jim! and itï¿½s a bully taw.ï¿½

ï¿½my! datï¿½s a mighty gay marvel, i tell you! but mars tom iï¿½s powerful

ï¿½and besides, if you will iï¿½ll show you my sore toe.ï¿½

jim was only human--this attraction was too much for him. he put down
his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing
interest while the bandage was being unwound. in another moment he
was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, tom was
whitewashing with vigor, and aunt polly was retiring from the field with
a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.

but tomï¿½s energy did not last. he began to think of t

dreading. benï¿½s gait was the hop-skip-and-jump--proof enough that his
heart was light and his anticipations high. he was eating an apple, and
giving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned
ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. as
he drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned
far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp
and circumstance--for he was personating the big missouri, and considered
himself to be drawing nine feet of water. he was boat and captain and
engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on his own
hurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them:

ï¿½stop her, sir! ting-a-ling-ling!ï¿½ the headway ran almost out, and he
drew up slowly toward the sidewalk.

ï¿½ship up to back! ting-a-ling-ling!ï¿½ his arms straightened and stiffened
down his sides.

ï¿½set her back on the stabboard! ting-a-ling-ling! chow! ch-chow-wow!

 the left hand began to describe circles.

ï¿½stop the stabboard! ting-a-ling-ling! stop the labboard! come ahead on
the stabboard! stop her! let your outside turn over slow! ting-a-ling-ling!

the engines, sir! ting-a-ling-ling! shï¿½t! sï¿½hï¿½t! shï¿½t!ï¿½ (trying the
gauge-cocks).

tom went on whitewashing--paid no attention to the steamboat. ben stared
a moment and then said: ï¿½_hi-yi! youï¿½re_ up a stump, ainï¿½t you!ï¿½

no answer. tom

surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then
he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as
before. ben ranged up alongside of him. tomï¿½s mouth watered for the
apple, but he stuck to his work. ben said:

ï¿½hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?ï¿½

tom wheeled suddenly and said:

ï¿½why, itï¿½s you, ben! i warnï¿½t noticing.ï¿½

ï¿½say--iï¿½m going in a-swimming, i am. donï¿½t you wish you could? but of
course youï¿½d druther _work_--wouldnï¿½t you? course you would!ï¿½

tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:

ï¿½what do you call work?ï¿½

ï¿½why, ainï¿½t _that_ work?ï¿½

tom resumed his whitewashing, and ans

ï¿½like it? well, i donï¿½t see why i oughtnï¿½t to like it. does a boy get a
chance to whitewash a fence every day?ï¿½

that put the thing in a new light. ben stopped nibbling his apple.
tom swept his brush daintily back and forth--stepped back to note the
effect--added a touch here and there--criticised the effect again--ben
watching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more
absorbed. presently he said:

ï¿½say, tom, let _me_ whitewash a little.ï¿½

tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind:

ï¿½no--no--i reckon it wouldnï¿½t hardly do, ben. you see, aunt pollyï¿½s awful
particular about this fence--right here on the street, you know--but if it
was the back fence i wouldnï¿½t mind and _she_ wouldnï¿½t. yes, sheï¿½s awful
particular about this fence; itï¿½s got to be done very careful; i reckon
there ainï¿½t one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it
the way itï¿½s got to be done.ï¿½

ï¿½no--is that so? oh come, now-

and anything was to happen to it--ï¿½

ï¿½oh, shucks, iï¿½ll be just as careful. now lemme try. say--iï¿½ll give you
the core of my apple.ï¿½

ï¿½well, here--no, ben, now donï¿½t. iï¿½m afeard--ï¿½

ï¿½iï¿½ll give you _all_ of it!ï¿½

tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity in his
heart. and while the late steamer big missouri worked and sweated in the
sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the sha

here was no lack of material; boys happened along every
little while; they came to jeer, but remained to whitewash. by the time
ben was fagged out, tom had traded the next chance to billy fisher for
a kite, in good repair; and when he played out, johnny miller bought in
for a dead rat and a string to swing it with--and so on, and so on, hour
after hour. and when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a
poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, tom was literally rolling in
wealth. he had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part
of a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a spool
cannon, a key that wouldnï¿½t unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a
glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles,
six fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass door-knob, a
dog-collar--but no dog--the handle of a knife, four pieces of orange-peel,
and a dilapidated old window sash.

he had had a nice, good, idle time all the while--plenty of co

he would now have
comprehended that work consists of whatever a body is _obliged_ to do,
and that play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. and
this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or
performing on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing
mont blanc is only amusement. there are wealthy gentlemen in england
who drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a
daily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable
money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn
it into work and then they would resign.

the boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place
in his worldly circumstances, and then wended toward headquarters to
report.




chapter iii

tom presented himself before aunt polly, who was sitting by an
open window in a pleasant rearward apartment, which was bedroom,
breakfast-room, dining-room, and library, combined. the balmy summer
air, the restful q

she was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took
him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him,
along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat
took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort.
and while she closed with a happy scriptural flourish, he ï¿½hookedï¿½ a
doughnut.

then he skipped out, and saw sid just starting up the outside stairway
that led to the back rooms on the second floor. clods were handy and
the air was full of them in a twinkling. they raged around sid like a
hail-storm; and before aunt polly could collect her surprised faculties
and sally to the rescue, six or seven clods had taken personal effect,
and tom was over the fence and gone. there was a gate, but as a general
thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it. his soul was at
peace, now that he had settled with si

ort days, and here in one instant of time
she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is
done.

he worshipped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that she had
discovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was present, and
began to ï¿½show offï¿½ in all sorts of absurd boyish ways, in order to win
her admiration. he kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time;
but by-and-by, while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic
performances, he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending
her way toward the house. tom came up to the fence and leaned on it,
grieving, and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer. she halted a
moment on the steps and then moved toward the door. tom heaved a great
sigh as she put her foot on the threshold. but his face lit up,
right away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she
disappeared.

the boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower, and
then shaded his eyes with his

 hand and began to look down street as
if he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction.
presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his
nose, with his head tilted far back; and as he moved from side to side,
in his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy; finally his
bare foot rested upon it, his pliant toes closed upon it, and he hopped
away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner. but only for a
minute--only while he could button the flower inside his jacket, next
his heart--or next his stomach, possibly, for he was not much posted in
anatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway.

he returned, now, and hung about the fence till nightfall, ï¿½showing
off,ï¿½ as before; but the 
 
 ___________________________
 
girl never exhibited herself again, though tom
comforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some
window, meantime, and been aware of his attentions. finally he strode
home reluctantly, with his poor head full of visions.

all through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered ï¿½what
had got into the child.ï¿½ he took a good scolding about clodding sid, and
did not seem to mind it in the least. he tried to steal sugar under his
auntï¿½s very nose, and got his knuckles rapped for it. he said:

ï¿½aunt, you donï¿½t whack sid when he takes it.ï¿½

ï¿½well, sid donï¿½t torment a body the way you do. youï¿½d be always into
that sugar if i warnï¿½t watching you.ï¿½

presently she stepped into the kitchen, and sid, happy in his immunity,
reached for the sugar-bowl--a sort of glorying over tom which was
wellnigh unbearable. but sidï¿½s fingers slippe

hen he would tell, and there would be
nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model ï¿½catch it.ï¿½ he was
so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old
lady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath
from over her spectacles. he said to himself, ï¿½now itï¿½s coming!ï¿½ and the
next instant he was sprawling on the floor! the potent palm was uplifted
to strike again when tom cried out:

ï¿½hold on, now, what ï¿½er you belting _me_ for?--sid broke it!ï¿½

aunt polly paused, perplexed, and tom looked for healing pity. but when
she got her tongue again, she only said:

ï¿½umf! well, you didnï¿½t get a lick amiss, i reckon. you been into some
other audacious mischief when i wasnï¿½t around, like enough.ï¿½

then her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say something
kind and loving; but she judged that this would be construed into a
confession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline forbade that.
so she kept silence, a

 window went up, a maid-servantï¿½s discordant voice profaned the holy
calm, and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyrï¿½s remains!

the strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort. there was a whiz
as of a missile in the air, mingled with the murmur of a curse, a sound
as of shivering glass followed, and a small, vague form went over the
fence and shot away in the gloom.

not long after, as tom, all undressed for bed, was surveying his
drenched garments by the light of a tallow dip, sid woke up; but if he
had any dim idea of making any ï¿½references to allusions,ï¿½ he thought
better of it and held his peace, for there was danger in tomï¿½s eye.

tom turned in without the added vexation of prayers, and sid made mental
note of the omission.




chapter iv

the sun rose upon a tranquil world, and beamed down upon the peaceful
village like a benediction. breakfast over, aunt polly had family
worship: it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid
courses of scriptural q
 
 ___________________________
 
uotations, welded together with a thin mortar of
originality; and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of
the mosaic law, as from sinai.

then tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to ï¿½get
his verses.ï¿½ sid had learned his lesson days before. tom bent all his
energies to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose part of the
sermon on the mount, because he could find no verses that were shorter.
at the end of half an hour tom had a vague general idea of his lesson,
but no more, for his mind was traversing the whole field of human
thought, and his hands were busy with distracting recreations. mary took
his book to hear him recite, and he tried to find his way through the
fog:

ï¿½blessed are the--

 knife would not cut anything,
but it was a ï¿½sure-enoughï¿½ barlow, and there was inconceivable grandeur
in that--though where the western boys ever got the idea that such a
weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing
mystery and will always remain so, perhaps. tom contrived to scarify the
cupboard with it, and was arranging to begin on the bureau, when he was
called off to dress for sunday-school.

mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap, and he went
outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there; then he
dipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned up his sleeves;
poured out the water on the ground, gently, and then entered the kitchen
and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door. but
mary removed the towel and said:

ï¿½now ainï¿½t you ashamed, tom. you mustnï¿½t be so bad. water wonï¿½t hurt
you.ï¿½

tom was a trifle disconcerted. the basin was refilled, and this time he
stood over it a little while, g

cleanliness that galled him. he
hoped that mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she
coated them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought
them out. he lost his temper and said he was always being made to do
everything he didnï¿½t want to do. but mary said, persuasively:

ï¿½please, tom--thatï¿½s a good boy.ï¿½

so he got into the shoes snarling. mary was soon ready, and the three
children set out for sunday-school--a place that tom hated with his whole
heart; but sid and mary were fond of it.

sabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past ten; and then church
service. two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily,
and the other always remained too--for stronger reasons. the churchï¿½s
high-backed, uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons;
the edifice was but a small, plain affair, with a sort of pine board
tree-box on top of it for a steeple. at the door tom dropped back a step
and accosted a sunday-dressed comrade:

why, is a mystery: for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music
is ever referred to by the sufferer. this superintendent was a slim
creature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair; he
wore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears
and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth--a
fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning of the
whole body when a side view was required; his chin was propped on a
spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank-note, and had
fringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply up, in the fashion
of the day, like sleigh-runners--an effect patiently and laboriously
produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a
wall for hours together. mr. walters was very earnest of mien, and very
sincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and places
in such reverence, and so separated

place like this, learning to do right and be good.ï¿½ and so forth and so
on. it is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration. it was of a
pattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all.

the latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights
and other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings
and whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases of
isolated and incorruptible rocks like sid and mary. but now every sound
ceased suddenly, with the subsidence of mr. waltersï¿½ voice, and the
conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude.

a good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was
more or less rare--the entrance of visitors: lawyer thatcher, accompanied
by a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman
with iron-gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latterï¿½s
wife. the lady was leading a child.

chapter v

about half-past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to ring,
and presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon. the
sunday-school children distributed themselves about the house and
occupied pews with their parents, so as to be under supervision. aunt
polly came, and tom and sid and mary sat with her--tom being placed next
the aisle, in order that he might be as far away from the open window
and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible. the crowd filed up
the aisles: the aged and needy postmaster, who had seen better days;
the mayor and his wife--for they had a mayor there, among other
unnecessaries; the justice of the peace; the widow douglass, fair,
smart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and well-to-do, her hill
mansion the only palace in the town, an

the model boy, willie mufferson, taking as heedful care of his mother as
if she were cut glass. he always brought his mother to church, and was
the pride of all the matrons. the boys all hated him, he was so
good. and besides, he had been ï¿½thrown up to themï¿½ so much. his
white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind, as usual on
sundays--accidentally. tom had no handkerchief, and he looked upon boys
who had as snobs.

the congregation being fully assembled, now, the bell rang once more,
to warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the
church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the
choir in the gallery. the choir always tittered and whispered all

away here in this age of abundant newspapers. often, the less there is
to justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it.

and now the minister prayed. a good, generous prayer it was, and went
into details: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the
church; for the other churches of the village; for the village itself;
for the county; for the state; for the state officers; for the united
states; for the churches of the united states; for congress; for the
president; for the officers of the government; for poor sailors, tossed
by stormy seas; for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of
european monarchies and oriental despotisms; for such as have the light
and the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear
withal; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed with
a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace
and favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a

amen.

there was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat down.
the boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he
only endured it--if he even did that much. he was restive all through it;
he kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously--for he was not
listening, but he knew the ground of old, and the clergymanï¿½s regular
route over it--and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded,
his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it; he considered
additions unfair, and scoundrelly. in the midst of the prayer a fly had
lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by
calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its head with its arms, and
polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with
the body, and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view; scraping
its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they
had been coat-tails; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly

e, and they eyed it too. presently a vagrant poodle dog came
idling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the
quiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. he spied the beetle; the
drooping tail lifted and wagged. he surveyed the prize; walked around
it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew
bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly
snatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy
the diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws,
and continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent
and absent-minded. his head nodded, and little by little his chin
descended and touched the enemy, who seized it. there was a sharp yelp,
a flirt of the poodleï¿½s head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards
away, and lit on its back once more. the neighboring spectators
shook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and
hand-kerchiefs, and tom was entirely

other weekï¿½s slow suffering in school. he
generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday,
it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious.

tom lay thinking. presently it occurred to him that he wished he was
sick; then he could stay home from school. here was a vague possibility.
he canvassed his system. no ailment was found, and he investigated
again. this time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms, and he
began to encourage them with considerable hope. but they soon grew
feeble, and presently died wholly away. he reflected further. suddenly
he discovered something. one of his upper front teeth was loose. this
was lucky; he was about to begin to groan, as a ï¿½starter,ï¿½ as he
called it, when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that
argument, his aunt would pull it out, and that would hurt. so he thought
he would hold the tooth in reserve for the present, and seek further.
nothing offered for some little time, and t

the doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or
three weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger. so the boy eagerly
drew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection.
but now he did not know the necessary symptoms. however, it seemed
well worth while to chance it, so he fell to groaning with considerable
spirit.

but sid slept on unconscious.

tom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe.

no result from sid.

tom was panting with his exertions by this time. he took a rest and then
swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans.

sid snored on.

tom was aggravated. he said, ï¿½sid, sid!ï¿½ and shook him. this course
worked well, and tom began to groan again. sid yawned, stretched, then
brought himself up on his elbow with a snort, and began to stare at tom.
tom went on

groaning. sid said:

ï¿½tom! say, tom!ï¿½ [no response.] ï¿½here, tom! tom! what is the matter,
tom?ï¿½ and he shook him and looked in his face anxiously.

tom moaned out:

ï¿½oh, donï¿½t, sid. donï¿½t joggle me.ï¿½

ï¿½why, whatï¿½s the matter, tom? i must call auntie.ï¿½

ï¿½no--never mind. itï¿½ll be over by and by, maybe. donï¿½t call anybody.ï¿½

ï¿½but i must! _donï¿½t_ groan so, tom, itï¿½s awful. how long you been this
way?ï¿½

ï¿½hours. ouch! oh, donï¿½t stir so, sid, youï¿½ll kill me.ï¿½

ï¿½tom, why didnï¿½t you wake me sooner? oh, tom, _donï¿½t!_ it makes my flesh
crawl to hear you. tom, what is the matter?ï¿½

ï¿½i forgive you everything, sid. [groan.] everything youï¿½ve ever done to

but sid had snatched his clothes and gone. tom was suffering in reality,
now, so handsomely was his imagination working, and so his groans had
gathered quite a genuine tone.

sid flew downstairs and said:

ï¿½oh, aunt polly, come! tomï¿½s dying!ï¿½

ï¿½dying!ï¿½

ï¿½yesï¿½m. donï¿½t wait--come quick!ï¿½

ï¿½rubbage! i donï¿½t believe it!ï¿½

but she fled upstairs, nevertheless, with sid and mary at her heels.
and her face grew white, too, and her lip trembled. when she reached the
bedside she gasped out:

ï¿½you, tom! tom, whatï¿½s the matter with you?ï¿½

ï¿½oh, auntie, iï¿½m--ï¿½

ï¿½whatï¿½s the matter with you--what is the matter with you, child?ï¿½

ï¿½oh, auntie, my sore toeï¿½s mortified!ï¿½

the old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little, then cried a
little, then did both together. this restored her and she said:

ï¿½tom, what a turn you did give me. now you shut up that nonsense and
climb out of this.ï¿½

the groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe.

interruption roused him.

ï¿½thomas sawyer!ï¿½

tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full, it meant trouble.

ï¿½sir!ï¿½

ï¿½come up here. now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?ï¿½

tom was about to take refuge in a lie, when he saw two long tails of
yellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric
sympathy of love; and by that form was _the only vacant place_ on the
girlsï¿½ side of the school-house. he instantly said:

ï¿½_i stopped to talk with huckleberry finn!_ï¿½

the masterï¿½s pulse stood still, and he stared helplessly. the buzz of
study ceased. the pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his
mind. the master said:

ï¿½you--you did what?ï¿½

ï¿½stopped to talk with huckleberry finn.ï¿½

there was no mistaking the words.

chapter vii

the harder tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more his ideas
wandered. so at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up. it seemed
to him that the noon recess would never come. the air was utterly dead.
there was not a breath stirring. it was the sleepiest of sleepy days.
the drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed
the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees. away off in the
flaming sunshine, cardiff hill lifted its soft green sides through a
shimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds
floated on lazy wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible
but some cows, and they were asleep. tomï¿½s heart ached to be free, or
else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time.
his hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of
gratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it. then furtively
the percussion-cap box came out. he released the tick and put him

on
the long flat desk. the creature probably glowed with a gratitude that
amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when
he started thankfully to travel off, tom turned him aside with a pin and
made him take a new direction.

tomï¿½s bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as tom had been, and
now he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in
an instant. this bosom friend was joe harper. the two boys were sworn
friends all the week, and embattled enemies on saturdays. joe took a
pin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner.
the sport grew in interest momently. soon tom said that they were
interfering with each other, and neit

her getting the fullest benefit
of the tick. so he put joeï¿½s slate on the desk and drew a line down the
middle of it from top to bottom.

ï¿½now,ï¿½ said he, ï¿½as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and
iï¿½ll let him alone; but if you let him get away and get on my side,
youï¿½re to leave him alone as long as i can keep him from crossing over.ï¿½

ï¿½all right, go ahead; start him up.ï¿½

the tick escaped from tom, presently, and crossed the equator. joe
harassed him awhile, and then he got away and crossed back again. this
change of base occurred often. while one boy was worrying the tick with
absorbing interest, the other would look on with interest as strong, the
two heads bowed together over the slate, and the two souls dead to all
things else. at last lu

ing to begin, joeï¿½s pin would deftly head him off, and keep
possession. at last tom could stand it no longer. the temptation was too
strong. so he reached out and lent a hand with his pin. joe was angry in
a moment. said he:

ï¿½tom, you let him alone.ï¿½

ï¿½i only just want to stir him up a little, joe.ï¿½

ï¿½no, sir, it ainï¿½t fair; you just let him alone.ï¿½

ï¿½blame it, i ainï¿½t going to stir him much.ï¿½

ï¿½let him alone, i tell you.ï¿½

ï¿½i wonï¿½t!ï¿½

ï¿½you shall--heï¿½s on my side of the line.ï¿½

ï¿½look here, joe harper, whose is that tick?ï¿½

ï¿½i donï¿½t care whose tick he is--heï¿½s on my side of the line, and you
shaï¿½nï¿½t touch him.ï¿½

ï¿½well, iï¿½ll just bet i will, though. heï¿½s my tick and iï¿½ll do what i
blame please with him, or die!ï¿½

a tremendous whack came down on tomï¿½s shoulders, and its duplicate on
joeï¿½s; and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from
the two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it. the boys had been

 his blunder and he stopped, confused.

ï¿½oh, tom! then i ainï¿½t the first youï¿½ve ever been engaged to!ï¿½

the child began to cry. tom said:

ï¿½oh, donï¿½t cry, becky, i donï¿½t care for her any more.ï¿½

ï¿½yes, you do, tom--you know you do.ï¿½

tom tried to put his arm about her neck, but she pushed him away and
turned her face to the wall, and went on crying. tom tried again, with
soothing words in his mouth, and was repulsed again. then his pride was
up, and he strode away and went outside. he stood about, restless and
uneasy, for a while, glancing at the door, every now and then, hoping
she would repent and come to find him. but she did not. then he began
to feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong. it was a hard struggle
with him to make new advances, now, but he nerved himself to it and
entered. she was still standing back there in the corner, sobbing, with
her face to the wall. tomï¿½s heart smote him. he went to her and stood a
moment, not knowing exactly how to proceed

or. how his name would fill the world, and make people shudder!
how gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas, in his long, low,
black-hulled racer, the spirit of the storm, with his grisly flag flying
at the fore! and at the zenith of his fame, how he would suddenly appear
at the old village and stalk into church, brown and weather-beaten, in
his black velvet doublet and trunks, his great jack-boots, his crimson
sash, his belt bristling with horse-pistols, his crime-rusted cutlass
at his side, his slouch hat with waving plumes, his black flag unfurled,
with the skull and crossbones on it, and hear with swelling ecstasy
the whisperings, ï¿½itï¿½s tom sawyer the pirate!--the black avenger of the
spanish main!ï¿½

yes, it was settled; his career was determined. he would run away from
home and enter upon it. he would start the very next morning. therefore
he must now begin to get ready. he would collect his resources together.
he went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under

 one end of
it with his barlow knife. he soon struck wood that sounded hollow. he
put his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively:

ï¿½what hasnï¿½t come here, come! whatï¿½s here, stay here!ï¿½

then he scraped away the dirt, and exposed a pine shingle. he took it
up and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides
were of shingles. in it lay a marble. tomï¿½s astonishment was bound-less!
he scratched his head with a perplexed air, and said:

ï¿½well, that beats anything!ï¿½

then he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood cogitating. the
truth was, that a superstition of his had failed, here, which he and
all his comrades had always looked upon as infallible. if you buried
a marble with certain necessary incantations, and left it alone a
fortnight, and then opened the place with the incantation he

s, and tom said, ï¿½where this arrow
falls, there bury poor robin hood under the greenwood tree.ï¿½ then he
shot the arrow and fell back and would have died, but he lit on a nettle
and sprang up too gaily for a corpse.

the boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off
grieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering what modern
civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss.
they said they would rather be outlaws a year in sherwood forest than
president of the united states forever.




chapter ix

at half-past nine, that night, tom and sid were sent to bed, as usual.
they said their prayers, and sid was soon asleep. tom lay awake and
waited, in restless impatience. when it seemed to him that it must be
nearly daylight, he heard the clock strike ten! this was despair. he
would have tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves demanded, but he was
afraid he might wake sid. so he lay still, and stared up into the dark.
everything was dismally still. by

ion of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet of
the grave.

then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time. the hooting of
a distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness. tomï¿½s
reflections grew oppressive. he must force some talk. so he said in a
whisper:

ï¿½hucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here?ï¿½

huckleberry whispered:

ï¿½i wisht i knowed. itï¿½s awful solemn like, _ainï¿½t_ it?ï¿½

ï¿½i bet it is.ï¿½

there was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this matter
inwardly. then tom whispered:

ï¿½say, hucky--do you reckon hoss williams hears us talking?ï¿½

ï¿½oï¿½ course he does. least his sperrit does.ï¿½

tom, after a pause:

ï¿½i wish iï¿½d said mister williams. but i never meant any harm. everybody
calls him hoss.ï¿½

ï¿½a body canï¿½t be too particï¿½lar how they talk ï¿½bout these-yer dead
people, tom.ï¿½

this was a damper, and conversation died again.

presently tom seized his comradeï¿½s arm an

s just what i was thinking to myself, huck.ï¿½

ï¿½if anybody tells, let muff potter do it, if heï¿½s fool enough. heï¿½s
generally drunk enough.ï¿½

tom said nothing--went on thinking. presently he whispered:

ï¿½huck, muff potter donï¿½t know it. how can he tell?ï¿½

ï¿½whatï¿½s the reason he donï¿½t know it?ï¿½

ï¿½because heï¿½d just got that whack when injun joe done it. dï¿½you reckon
he could see anything? dï¿½you reckon he knowed anything?ï¿½

ï¿½by hokey, thatï¿½s so, tom!ï¿½

ï¿½and besides, look-a-here--maybe that whack done for _him_!ï¿½

ï¿½no, ï¿½taint likely, tom. he had liquor in him; i could see that; and
besides, he always has. well, when papï¿½s full, you might take and belt
him over the head with a church and you couldnï¿½t phase him. he says so,
his own self. so itï¿½s the same with muff potter, of course. but if a man
was dead sober, i reckon maybe that whack might fetch him; i dono.ï¿½

after another reflective silence, tom said:

ï¿½hucky, you sure you can keep mum

waller some of it once--youï¿½ll
see.ï¿½

so tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy pricked
the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood. in time, after
many squeezes, tom managed to sign his initials, using the ball of his
little finger for a pen. then he showed huckleberry how to make an h and
an f, and the oath was complete. they buried the shingle close to the
wall, with some dismal ceremonies and incantations, and the fetters
that bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown
away.

a figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined
building, now, but they did not notice it.

ï¿½tom,ï¿½ whispered huckleberry, ï¿½does this keep us from _ever_
telling--_always_?ï¿½

ï¿½of course it does. it donï¿½t make any difference _what_ happens, we got
to keep mum. weï¿½d drop down dead--donï¿½t _you_ know that?ï¿½

ï¿½yes, i reckon thatï¿½s so.ï¿½

they continued to whisper for some little time. presently a dog set up
a l

ong, lugubrious howl just outside--within ten feet of them. the boys
clasped each other suddenly, in an agony of fright.

ï¿½which of us does he mean?ï¿½ gasped huckleberry.

ï¿½i dono--peep through the crack. quick!ï¿½

ï¿½no, _you_, tom!ï¿½

ï¿½i canï¿½t--i canï¿½t _do_ it, huck!ï¿½

ï¿½please, tom. there ï¿½tis again!ï¿½

ï¿½oh, lordy, iï¿½m thankful!ï¿½ whispered tom. ï¿½i know his voice. itï¿½s bull

[* if mr. harbison owned a slave named bull, tom would have spoken of
him as ï¿½harbisonï¿½s bull,ï¿½ but a

tom, quaking with fear, yielded, and put his eye to the crack. his
whisper was hardly audible when he said:

ï¿½oh, huck, _its a stray dog_!ï¿½

ï¿½quick, tom, quick! who does he mean?ï¿½

ï¿½huck, he must mean us both--weï¿½re right together.ï¿½

ï¿½oh, tom, i reckon weï¿½re goners. i reckon there ainï¿½t no mistake ï¿½bout
where _iï¿½ll_ go to. i been so wicked.ï¿½

ï¿½dad fetch it! this comes of playing hookey and doing everything a
fellerï¿½s told _not_ to do. i might a been good, like sid, if iï¿½d a
tried--but no, i wouldnï¿½t, of course. but if ever i get off this time,
i lay iï¿½ll just _waller_ in sunday-schools!ï¿½ and tom began to snuffle a
little.

ï¿½_you_ bad!ï¿½ and huckleberry began to snuffle too. ï¿½consound it, tom
sawyer, youï¿½re just old pie, ï¿½long-side oï¿½ what i am. oh, _lordy_,
lordy, lordy, i wisht i only had half your chance.ï¿½

tom choked off and whispered:

ï¿½look, hucky, look! heï¿½s got his _back_ to us!ï¿½

hucky looked, with joy in his heart.

ï¿
 
 ___________________________
 


ï¿½yes, he did. but i, like a fool, never thought. oh, this is bully, you
know. _now_ who can he mean?ï¿½

the howling stopped. tom pricked up his ears.

ï¿½sh! whatï¿½s that?ï¿½ he whispered.

ï¿½sounds like--like hogs grunting. no--itï¿½s somebody snoring, tom.ï¿½

ï¿½that _is_ it! where ï¿½bouts is it, huck?ï¿½

ï¿½i bleeve itï¿½s down at ï¿½tother end. sounds so, anyway. pap used to sleep
there, sometimes, ï¿½long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he just lifts
things when _he_ snores. besides, i reckon he ainï¿½t ever coming back to
this town any more.ï¿½

the spirit of adventure rose in the boysï¿½ souls once more.

ï¿½hucky, do you dasï¿½t to go if i lead?ï¿½

ï¿½i donï¿½t like to, much. tom, sï¿½pose itï¿½s injun joe!ï¿½

tom quailed. but presently the temptation rose up strong again and the
boys agreed to try, with the understanding that they would take to their
heels if the snoring stopped. so they went tiptoeing stealthily down,
the one behind the other. when they had got to

nï¿½t _dead_. and whatï¿½s more, sheï¿½s getting better, too.ï¿½

ï¿½all right, you wait and see. sheï¿½s a goner, just as dead sure as muff
potterï¿½s a goner. thatï¿½s what the niggers say, and they know all about
these kind of things, huck.ï¿½

then they separated, cogitating. when tom crept in at his bedroom window
the night was almost spent. he undressed with excessive caution, and
fell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade. he
was not aware that the gently-snoring sid was awake, and had been so for
an hour.

when tom awoke, sid was dressed and gone. there was a late look in the
light, a late sense in the atmosphere. he was startled. why had he not
been called--persecuted till he was up, as usual? the thought filled
him with bodings. within five minutes he was dressed and down-stairs,
feeling sore and drowsy. the family were still at table, but they had
finished breakfast. there was no voice of rebuke; but there were averted
eyes; there was a silence and an a
 
 ___________________________
 
ir of solemnity that struck a chill
to the culpritï¿½s heart. he sat down and tried to seem gay, but it
was up-hill work; it roused no smile, no response, and he lapsed into
silence and let his heart sink down to the depths.

after breakfast his aunt took him aside, and tom almost brightened in
the hope that he was going to be flogged; but it was not so. his aunt
wept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so;
and finally told him to go on, and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs
with sorrow to the grave, for it was no use for her to try any more.
this was worse than a thousand whippings, and tomï¿½s heart was sorer now
than his body. he cried, he pleaded for forgiveness, promised to reform
over and over again, and then received
 
 ___________________________
 
 his dismissal, feeling that
he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble
confidence.

he left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward
sid; and so the latterï¿½s prompt retreat through the back gate was
unnecessary. he moped to school gloomy and sad, and took his flogging,
along with joe harper, for playing hookey the day before, with the
air of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to
trifles. then he betook himself to his seat, rested his elbows on his
desk and his jaws in his hands, and stared at the wall with the stony
stare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go.
his elbow was press

raise the body of the murdered man and put it in
a wagon for removal; and it was whispered through the shuddering
crowd that the wound bled a little! the boys thought that this happy
circumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction; but they were
disappointed, for more than one villager remarked:

ï¿½it was within three feet of muff potter when it done it.ï¿½

tomï¿½s fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as
much as a week after this; and at breakfast one morning sid said:

ï¿½tom, you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me
awake half the time.ï¿½

tom blanched and dropped his eyes.

ï¿½itï¿½s a bad sign,ï¿½ said aunt polly, gravely. ï¿½what you got on your mind,
tom?ï¿½

ï¿½nothing. nothing ï¿½t i know of.ï¿½ but the boyï¿½s hand shook so that he
spilled his coffee.

ï¿½and you do talk such stuff,ï¿½ sid said. ï¿½last night you said, ï¿½itï¿½s
blood, itï¿½s blood, thatï¿½s what it is!ï¿½ you said that over and over.
and you said, ï¿½d

onï¿½t torment me so--iï¿½ll tell!ï¿½ tell _what_? what is it
youï¿½ll tell?ï¿½

everything was swimming before tom. there is no telling what might have
happened, now, but luckily the concern passed out of aunt pollyï¿½s face
and she came to tomï¿½s relief without knowing it. she said:

ï¿½sho! itï¿½s that dreadful murder. i dream about it most every night
myself. sometimes i dream itï¿½s me that done it.ï¿½

mary said she had been affected much the same way. sid seemed satisfied.
tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could, and after
that he complained of toothache for a week, and tied up his jaws every
night. he never knew that sid lay nightly watching, and frequently
slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good
while at a time, and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place
again. tomï¿½s distress of mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew
irksome and was discarded. if sid really managed to make an

ything out of
tomï¿½s disjointed mutterings, he kept it to himself.

it seemed to tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding
inquests on dead cats, and thus keeping his trouble present to his mind.
sid noticed that tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries,
though it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises;
he noticed, too, that tom never acted as a witness--and that was strange;
and sid did not overlook the fact that tom even showed a marked aversion
to these inquests, and always avoided them when he could. sid marvelled,
but said nothing. however, even inquests went out of vogue at last, and
ceased to torture tomï¿½s conscience.

every day or two, during this time of sorrow, tom watched his
opportunity and went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled such
small comforts through to the ï¿½murdererï¿½ as he could get hold of. the
jail was a trifling little brick den that

 interest, if she had built a fire under him.

tom felt that it was time to wake up; this sort of life might be
romantic enough, in his blighted condition, but it was getting to have
too little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it. so he
thought over various plans for relief, and finally hit upon that of
professing to be fond of pain-killer. he asked for it so often that he
became a nuisance, and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself and
quit bothering her. if it had been sid, she would have had no misgivings
to alloy her delight; but since it was tom, she watched the bottle
clandestinely. she found that the medicine did really diminish, but it
did not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a crack in
the sitting-room floor with it.

one day tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his auntï¿½s yellow
cat came along, purring, eyeing the teaspoon avariciously, and begging
for a taste. tom said:

ï¿½donï¿½t ask for it unless you want it, peter.ï¿½

ï¿½ï¿½tis well. give the countersign.ï¿½

two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the
brooding night:

ï¿½_blood_!ï¿½

then tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it,
tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort. there was
an easy, comfortable path along the shore under the bluff, but it lacked
the advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate.

the terror of the seas had brought a side of bacon, and had about worn
himself out with getting it there. finn the red-handed had stolen a
skillet and a quantity of half-cured leaf tobacco, and had also brought
a few corn-cobs to make pipes with. but none of the pirates smoked or
ï¿½chewedï¿½ but himself. the black avenger of the spanish main said it
would never do to start without some fire. that was a wise thought;
matches were hardly known there in that day. they saw a fire smouldering
upon a great raft a hundred yards above, and t

time, and made shift to avert it. about two oï¿½clock in the morning the
raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island,
and they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight. part
of the little raftï¿½s belongings consisted of an old sail, and this they
spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions;
but they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather, as
became outlaws.

they built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps
within the sombre depths of the forest, and then cooked some bacon in
the frying-pan for supper, and used up half of the corn ï¿½poneï¿½ stock
they had brought. it seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild,
free way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island,
far from the haunts of men, and they said they never would return to
civilization. the climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy
glare upon the pillared tree-trunk

nothing betterï¿½n this. i donï¿½t ever get enough to eat, genï¿½ally--and here
they canï¿½t come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so.ï¿½

ï¿½itï¿½s just the life for me,ï¿½ said tom. ï¿½you donï¿½t have to get up,
mornings, and you donï¿½t have to go to school, and wash, and all that
blame foolishness. you see a pirate donï¿½t have to do _anything_, joe,

know. iï¿½d a good deal rather be a pirate, now that iï¿½ve tried it.ï¿½

they used to in old times, but a pirateï¿½s always respected. and

of nature shaking off sleep and going
to work unfolded itself to the musing boy. a little green worm came
crawling over a dewy leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air
from time to time and ï¿½sniffing around,ï¿½ then proceeding again--for he
was measuring, tom said; and when the worm approached him, of its own
accord, he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling,
by turns, as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to
go elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its
curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon tomï¿½s leg and
began a journey over him, his whole heart was glad--for that meant that
he was going to have a new suit of clothes--without the shadow of a
doubt a gaudy piratical uniform. now a procession of ants appeared,
from nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one struggled
manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms,
and lugged it straight up a tree-trunk. a br

more than once. a tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily at its ball, and
tom touched the creature, to see it shut its legs against its body
and pretend to be dead. the birds were fairly rioting by this time. a
catbird, the northern mocker, lit in a tree over tomï¿½s head, and trilled
out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment; then
a shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and stopped on a twig
almost within the boyï¿½s reach, cocked his head to one side and eyed the
strangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel and a big fellow
of the ï¿½foxï¿½ kind came skurrying along, sitting up at intervals to
inspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things had probably never
seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not.
all nature was wide awake and stirring, now; long lances of sunlight
pierced down through the dense foliage far and near, and a few
butterflies came fluttering upon the scene.

g to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town. they
parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water. the little
steam ferry-boat was about a mile below the village, drifting with the
current. her broad deck seemed crowded with people. there were a great
many skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood
of the ferryboat, but the boys could not determine what the men in
them were doing. presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the
ferryboatï¿½s side, and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud, that same
dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again.

ï¿½i know now!ï¿½ exclaimed tom; ï¿½somebodyï¿½s drownded!ï¿½

ï¿½thatï¿½s it!ï¿½ said huck; ï¿½they done that last summer, when bill turner
got drownded; they shoot a cannon over the water, and that makes
him come up to the top. yes, and they take loaves of bread and put
quicksilver in ï¿½em and set ï¿½em afloat, and wherever thereï¿½s anybody

his success, for he knew it was the boatï¿½s last trip for the night. at
the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, and
tom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards
downstream, out of danger of possible stragglers.

he flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself at his
auntï¿½s back fence. he climbed over, approached the ï¿½ell,ï¿½ and looked
in at the sitting-room window, for a light was burning there. there
sat aunt polly, sid, mary, and joe harperï¿½s mother, grouped together,
talking. they were by the bed, and the bed was between them and the
door. tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch; then
he pressed gently and the door yielded a crack; he continued pushing
cautiously, and quaking every time it creaked, till he judged he might
squeeze through on his knees; so he put his head through and began,
warily.

ï¿½what makes the candle blow so?ï¿½ said aunt polly. tom hurried up. ï¿½why,

tom disappeared under the bed just in time. he lay and ï¿½breathedï¿½
 himself for a time, and then crept to where he could almost touch his
auntï¿½s foot.

ï¿½but as i was saying,ï¿½ said aunt polly, ï¿½he warnï¿½t _bad_, so to say--only
misch_ee_vous. only just giddy, and harum-scarum, you know. he warnï¿½t
any more responsible than a colt. _he_ never meant any harm, and he was

ï¿½it was just so with my joe--always full of his

break.

ï¿½i hope tomï¿½s better off where he is,ï¿½ said sid, ï¿½but if heï¿½d been
better in some ways--ï¿½

ï¿½_sid!_ï¿½ tom felt the glare of the old ladyï¿½s eye, though he could not
see it. ï¿½not a word against my tom, now that heï¿½s gone! godï¿½ll take care
of _him_--never you trouble _your_self, sir! oh, mrs. harper, i donï¿½t
know how to give him up! i donï¿½t know how to give him up! he was such a
comfort to me, although he tormented my old heart out of me, ï¿½most.ï¿½

e the boys, being good swimmers, would
otherwise have escaped to shore. this was wednesday night. if the bodies
continued missing until sunday, all hope would be given over, and the
funerals would be preached on that morning. tom shuddered.

mrs. harper gave a sobbing goodnight and turned to go. then with a
mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each otherï¿½s
arms and had a good, consoling cry, and then parted. aunt polly was
tender far beyond her wont, in her goodnight to sid and mary. sid
snuffled a bit and mary went off crying with all her heart.

aunt polly knelt down and prayed for tom so touchingly, so appealingly,
and with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice,
that he was weltering in tears again, long before she was through.

he had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept making
broken-hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing unrestfully, and
turning over. but at last she was still, only moaning a little in her

sleep. now the boy stole out, rose gradually by the bedside, shaded the
candle-light with his hand, and stood regarding her. his heart was full
of pity for her. he took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the
candle. but something occurred to him, and he lingered considering.
his face lighted with a happy solution of his thought; he put the bark
hastily in his pocket. then he bent over and kissed the faded lips, and
straightway made his stealthy exit, latching the door behind him.

he threaded his way back to the ferry landing, found nobody at large
there, and walked boldly on board the boat, for he knew she was
tenantless except that there was a watchman, who always turned in and
slept like a graven image. he untied the skiff at the stern, slipped

mile above the village, he started quartering across and bent himself
stoutly to his work. he hit the landing on the other side neatly, for
this was a familiar bit of work to him. he was moved to capture
the skiff, arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore
legitimate prey for a pirate, but he knew a thorough search would be
made for it and that might end in revelations. so he stepped ashore and
entered the woods.

he sat down and took a long rest, torturing himself meanwhile to keep
awake, and then started warily down the home-stretch. the night was far
spent. it was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the
island bar. he rested again until the sun was well up and gilding the

ant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction.

the lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will,
chattering all the time about tomï¿½s stupendous plan and admiring the
genius of it. after a dainty egg and fish dinner, tom said he wanted to
learn to smoke, now. joe caught at the idea and said he would like to
try, too. so huck made pipes and filled them. these novices had never
smoked anything before but cigars made of grapevine, and they ï¿½bitï¿½ the
tongue, and were not considered manly anyway.

now they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff,
charily, and with slender confidence. the smoke had an unpleasant taste,
and they gagged a little, but tom said:

ï¿½why, itï¿½s just as easy! if iï¿½d a knowed this was all, iï¿½d a learnt long
ago.ï¿½

ï¿½so would i,ï¿½ said joe. ï¿½itï¿½s just nothing.ï¿½

ï¿½why, many a time iï¿½ve looked at people smoking, and thought well i wish
i could do that; but i never thought i could,ï¿½ said tom.

ï¿½thatï¿½s ju

ï¿½so do i! and when we tell ï¿½em we learned when we was off pirating,
wonï¿½t they wish theyï¿½d been along?ï¿½

ï¿½oh, i reckon not! iï¿½ll just _bet_ they will!ï¿½

so the talk ran on. but presently it began to flag a trifle, and
grow disjointed. the silences widened; the expectoration marvellously
increased. every pore inside the boysï¿½ cheeks became a spouting
fountain; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues
fast enough to prevent an inundation; little overflowings down their
throats occurred in spite of all they could do, and sudden retchings
followed every time. both boys were looking very pale and miserable,
now. joeï¿½s pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers. tomï¿½s followed. both
fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and

stenings and went winging away on the blast. the boys seized each
othersï¿½ hands and fled, with many tumblings and bruises, to the shelter
of a great oak that stood upon the riverbank. now the battle was at its
highest. under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed
in the skies, everything below stood out in cleancut and shadowless
distinctness: the bending trees, the billowy river, white with foam, the
driving spray of spumeflakes, the dim outlines of the high bluffs on
the other side, glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the slanting
veil of rain. every little while some giant tree yielded the fight
and fell crashing through the younger growth; and the unflagging
thunderpeals came now in ear-splitting explosive bursts, keen and sharp,
and unspeakably appalling. the storm culminated in one matchless effort
that seemed likely to tear the island to pieces, burn it up, drown it to
the treetops, blow it away, and deafen every creature in it, all at one
and the same momen

y were but
heedless lads, like their generation, and had made no provision against
rain. here was matter for dismay, for they were soaked through and
chilled. they were eloquent in their distress; but they presently
discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had
been built against (where it curved upward and separated itself from
the ground), that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting; so they
patiently wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the under
sides of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again. then they
piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and were
gladhearted once more. they dried their boiled ham and had a feast,
and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their
midnight adventure until morning, for there was not a dry spot to sleep
on, anywhere around.

as the sun began to steal in upon the boys, drowsiness came over
them, and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep. they

ournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush
that lay upon nature. the villagers began to gather, loitering a moment
in the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event. but there
was no whispering in the house; only the funereal rustling of dresses
as the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there. none
could remember when the little church had been so full before. there
was finally a waiting pause, an expectant dumbness, and then aunt polly
entered, followed by sid and mary, and they by the harper family, all in
deep black, and the whole congregation, the old minister as well, rose
reverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front pew.
there was another communing silence, broken at intervals by muffled
sobs, and then the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed. a moving
hymn was sung, and the text followed: ï¿½i am the resurrection and the
life.ï¿½

as the service proceeded, the clergyman drew such pictures of the
graces, the winning wa

ï¿½i--well, i donï¿½t know. ï¿½twould ï¿½aï¿½ spoiled everything.ï¿½

tone that discomforted the boy. ï¿½it would have been something if youï¿½d
cared enough to _think_ of it, even if you didnï¿½t _do_ it.ï¿½

ï¿½now, auntie, that ainï¿½t any harm,ï¿½ pleaded mary; ï¿½itï¿½s only tomï¿½s giddy

_done_ it, too. tom, youï¿½ll look back, some day, when itï¿½s too late,
and wish youï¿½d cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so
little.ï¿½

ï¿½now, auntie, you know i do care for you,ï¿½ said tom.

ï¿½iï¿½d know it better if you acted more like it.ï¿½

at recess tom continued his flirtation with amy with jubilant
self-satisfaction. and he kept drifting about to find becky and lacerate
her with the performance. at last he spied her, but there was a sudden
falling of his mercury. she was sitting cosily on a little bench behind
the schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with alfred temple--and so
absorbed were they, and their heads so close together over the book,
that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides.
jealousy ran red-hot through tomï¿½s veins. he began to hate himself for
throwing away the chance becky had offered for a reconciliation. he
called himself a fool, and all the hard names he could think of. he
wanted to cry with vexation. amy chatted happily along, as they walked,
for her heart was singing, but tomï¿½s tongue had lost its function. he
did not hear what amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly
he could only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced

a footstep, but it was a false hope; no tom came. at last she grew
entirely miserable and wished she hadnï¿½t carried it so far. when
poor alfred, seeing that he was losing her, he did not know how, kept
exclaiming: ï¿½oh, hereï¿½s a jolly one! look at this!ï¿½ she lost patience at
last, and said, ï¿½oh, donï¿½t bother me! i donï¿½t care for them!ï¿½ and burst
into tears, and got up and walked away.

alfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her, but she
said:

ï¿½go away and leave me alone, canï¿½t you! i hate you!ï¿½

so the boy halted, wondering what he could have done--for she had said
she would look at pictures all through the nooning--and she walked on,
crying. then alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse. he was
humiliated and angry. he easily guessed his way to the truth--the girl
had simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon tom sawyer.

think to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you couldnï¿½t ever think
to pity us and save us from sorrow.ï¿½

ï¿½auntie, i know now it was mean, but i didnï¿½t mean to be mean. i didnï¿½t,

ï¿½benjamin rogers, did you tear this book?ï¿½

a denial. another pause.

ï¿½joseph harper, did you?ï¿½

another denial. tomï¿½s uneasiness grew more and more intense under the
slow torture of these proceedings. the master scanned the ranks of
boys--considered a while, then turned to the girls:

ï¿½amy lawrence?ï¿½

a shake of the head.

ï¿½gracie miller?ï¿½

the same sign.

ï¿½susan harper, did you do this?ï¿½

another negative. the next girl was becky thatcher. tom was trembling
from head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of the
situation.

ï¿½rebecca thatcherï¿½ [tom glanced at her face--it was white with
terror]--ï¿½did you tear--no, look me in the faceï¿½ [her hands rose in
appeal]--ï¿½did you tear this book?ï¿½

bered faculties; and when he stepped forward
to go to his punishment the surprise, the gratitude, the adoration that
shone upon him out of poor beckyï¿½s eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred
floggings. inspired by the splendor of his own act, he took without
an outcry the most merciless flaying that even mr. dobbins had ever
administered; and also received with indifference the added cruelty of a
command to remain two hours after school should be dismissed--for he
knew who would wait for him outside till his captivity was done, and not
count the tedious time as loss, either.

tom went to bed that night planning vengeance against alfred temple; for
with shame and repentance becky had told him all, not forgetting her own
treachery; but even the longing for vengeance had to give way, soon, to
pleasanter musings, and he fell asleep at last with beckyï¿½s latest words
lingering dreamily in his ear--

ï¿½tom, how _could_ you be so noble!ï¿½

in the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived. at eight in
the evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted, and adorned with
wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers. the master sat throned in
his great chair upon a raised platform, with his blackboard behind him.
he was looking tolerably mellow. three rows of benches on each side and
six rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town
and by the parents of the pupils. to his left, back of the rows of
citizens, was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the
scholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening; rows of
small boys, washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort;
rows of gawky big boys; snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in
lawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms, their

ï¿½a missouri maidenï¿½s farewell to alabama

ï¿½alabama, goodbye! i love thee well! but yet for a while do i leave thee
now! sad, yes, sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell, and burning
recollections throng my brow! for i have wandered through thy flowery
woods; have roamed and read near tallapoosaï¿½s stream; have listened to
tallasseeï¿½s warring floods, and wooed on coosaï¿½s side auroraï¿½s beam.

ï¿½yet shame i not to bear an oï¿½erfull heart, nor blush to turn behind
my tearful eyes; ï¿½tis from no stranger land i now must part, ï¿½tis to no
strangers left i yield these sighs. welcome and home were mine within
this state, whose vales i leave--whose spires fade fast from me and cold
must be mine eyes, and heart, and tete, when, dear alabama! they turn

grief, my second bliss in joy,ï¿½ came to my side. she moved like one of
those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks of fancyï¿½s eden by
the romantic and young, a queen of beauty unadorned save by her own
transcendent loveliness. so soft was her step, it failed to make even a
sound, and but for the magical thrill imparted by her genial touch,
as other unobtrusive beauties, she would have glided away
unperceived--unsought. a strange sadness rested upon her features, like
icy tears upon the robe of december, as she pointed to the contendin

this nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with a
sermon so destructive of all hope to non-presbyterians that it took
the first prize. this composition was considered to be the very finest
effort of the evening. the mayor of the village, in delivering the prize
to the author of it, made a warm speech in which he said that it was by
far the most ï¿½eloquentï¿½ thing he had ever listened to, and that daniel
webster himself might well be proud of it.

it may be remarked, in passing, that the number of compositions in which
the word ï¿½beauteousï¿½ was over-fondled, and human experience referred to

there were some boys-and-girlsï¿½ parties, but they were so few and so
delightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder.

becky thatcher was gone to her constantinople home to stay with her
parents during vacation--so there was no bright side to life anywhere.

the dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery. it was a very
cancer for permanency and pain.

during two long weeks tom lay a prisoner, dead to the world and its

upon his feet at last and moved feebly downtown, a melancholy change had

chapter xxiv

tom was a glittering hero once more--the pet of the old, the envy of the
young. his name even went into immortal print, for the village paper
magnified him. there were some that believed he would be president, yet,
if he escaped hanging.

as usual, the fickle, unreasoning world took muff potter to its bosom
and fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before. but that sort
of conduct is to the worldï¿½s credit; therefore it is not well to find
fault with it.

tomï¿½s days were days of splendor and exultation to him, but his nights
were seasons of horror. injun joe infested all his dreams, and always
with doom in his eye. hardly any temptation could persuade the boy

ï¿½he didnï¿½t have any other name. kings donï¿½t have any but a given name.ï¿½

ï¿½no?ï¿½

ï¿½but they donï¿½t.ï¿½

ï¿½well, if they like it, tom, all right; but i donï¿½t want to be a king

down in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke.

ï¿½i know it, but then thereï¿½s another thing.ï¿½

ï¿½whatï¿½s that?ï¿½.

ï¿½why, we only guessed at the time. like enough it was too late or too
early.ï¿½

huck dropped his shovel.

ï¿½thatï¿½s it,ï¿½ said he. ï¿½thatï¿½s the very trouble. we got to give this one
up. we canï¿½t ever tell the right time, and besides this kind of thingï¿½s
too awful, here this time of night with witches and ghosts a-fluttering

ï¿½donï¿½t tom! itï¿½s awful.ï¿½

ï¿½well, it just is. huck, i donï¿½t feel comfortable a bit.ï¿½

ï¿½say, tom, letï¿½s give this place up, and try somewheres else.ï¿½

ï¿½all right, i reckon we better.ï¿½

ï¿½whatï¿½ll it be?ï¿½

tom considered awhile; and then said:

ï¿½the haï¿½nted house. thatï¿½s it!ï¿½

ï¿½blame it, i donï¿½t like haï¿½nted houses, tom. why, theyï¿½re a dern sight
worseï¿½n dead people. dead people might talk, maybe, but they donï¿½t come
sliding around in a shroud, when you ainï¿½t noticing, and peep over your
shoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth, the way a ghost does. i

ood the ï¿½haï¿½ntedï¿½ house, utterly isolated,
its fences gone long ago, rank weeds smothering the very doorsteps, the
chimney crumbled to ruin, the window-sashes vacant, a corner of the roof
caved in. the boys gazed awhile, half expecting to see a blue light flit
past a window; then talking in a low tone, as befitted the time and the
circumstances, they struck far off to the right, to give the haunted
house a wide berth, and took their way homeward through the woods that
adorned the rearward side of cardiff hill.




chapter xvi

about noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree; they had come
for their tools. tom was impatient to go to the haunted house; huck was
measurably so, also--but suddenly said:

ï¿½lookyhere, tom, do you know what day it is?ï¿½

tom mentally ran over the days of the week, and then quickly lifted his
eyes with a startled look in them--

ï¿½my! i never once thought of it, huck!ï¿½

ï¿½well, i didnï¿½t neither, but all at once it popped onto me that it wa

ï¿½half-rotten plank--no, itï¿½s a box, i believe. here--bear a hand and weï¿½ll
see what itï¿½s here for. never mind, iï¿½ve broke a hole.ï¿½

he reached his hand in and drew it out--

ï¿½man, itï¿½s money!ï¿½

the two men examined the handful of coins. they were gold. the boys
above were as excited as themselves, and as delighted.

joeï¿½s comrade said:

ï¿½weï¿½ll make quick work of this. thereï¿½s an old rusty pick over amongst
the weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace--i saw it a
minute ago.ï¿½

he ran and brought the boysï¿½ pick and shovel. injun joe took the
pick, looked it over critically, shook his head, muttered something to
himself, and then began to use it. the box was soon unearthed. it was
not very large; it was iron bound and had been very strong before the
slow years had injured it. the men contemplated the treasure awhile in
blissful silence.

ï¿½pard, thereï¿½s thousands of dollars here,ï¿½ said injun joe.

chapter xxviii

that night tom and huck were ready for their adventure. they hung about
the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine, one watching the alley
at a distance and the other the tavern door. nobody entered the alley or
left it; nobody resembling the spaniard entered or left the tavern
door. the night promised to be a fair one; so tom went home with the
understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on, huck
was to come and ï¿½maow,ï¿½ whereupon he would slip out and try the keys.
but the night remained clear, and huck closed his watch and retired to
bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve.

tuesday the boys had the same ill luck. also wednesday. but thursday
night promised better. tom slipped out in good season with his auntï¿½s
old tin lantern, and a large towel to blindfold it with. he hid the
lantern in huckï¿½s sugar hogshead and the watch began. an h

donï¿½t you see, now, whatï¿½s the matter with that haï¿½nted room?ï¿½

ï¿½how?ï¿½

ï¿½why, itï¿½s haï¿½nted with whiskey! maybe _all_ the temperance taverns have
got a haï¿½nted room, hey, huck?ï¿½

ï¿½well, i reckon maybe thatï¿½s so. whoï¿½d ï¿½aï¿½ thought such a thing? but
say, tom, nowï¿½s a mighty good time to get that box, if injun joeï¿½s
drunk.ï¿½

ï¿½it is, that! you try it!ï¿½

huck shuddered.

ï¿½well, no--i reckon not.ï¿½

ï¿½and i reckon not, huck. only one bottle alongside of injun joe ainï¿½t
enough. if thereï¿½d been three, heï¿½d be drunk enough and iï¿½d do it.ï¿½

there was a long pause for reflection, and then tom said:

ï¿½lookyhere, huck, less not try that thing any more till we know injun
joeï¿½s not in there. itï¿½s too scary. now, if we watch every night, weï¿½ll
be dead sure to see him go out, some time or other, and then weï¿½ll

led him to keep
awake until a pretty late hour, and he had good hopes of hearing huckï¿½s
ï¿½maow,ï¿½ and of having his treasure to astonish becky and the picnickers
with, next day; but he was disappointed. no signal came that night.

morning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven oï¿½clock a giddy and
rollicking company were gathered at judge thatcherï¿½s, and everything was
ready for a start. it was not the custom for elderly people to mar the
picnics with their presence. the children were considered safe enough
under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young
gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. the old steam ferry-boat was
chartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the main
street laden with provision-baskets. sid was sick and had to miss
the fun; mary remained at home to entertain him. the last thing mrs.
thatcher said to becky, was:

ï¿½youï¿½ll not get back till late. perhaps youï¿½d better stay all night with
some of the girls that live nea

ferent ways of getting hot and tired were gone
through with, and by-and-by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified
with responsible appetites, and then the destruction of the good things
began. after the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in
the shade of spreading oaks. by-and-by somebody shouted:

ï¿½whoï¿½s ready for the cave?ï¿½

everybody was. bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there
was a general scamper up the hill. the mouth of the cave was up the
hillside--an opening shaped like a letter a. its massive oaken door stood
unbarred. within was a small chamber, chilly as an icehouse, and walled
by nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat. it was
romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out
upon the green valley shining in the sun. but the impressiveness of the
situation quickly wore off, and the romping began again. the moment
a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a
struggle an

d of the cave; and that he might go down, and down, and
still down, into the earth, and it was just the same--labyrinth under
labyrinth, and no end to any of them. no man ï¿½knewï¿½ the cave. that was
an impossible thing. most of the young men knew a portion of it, and it
was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion. tom sawyer
knew as much of the cave as any one.

the procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of
a mile, and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch
avenues, fly along the dismal corridors, and take each other by surprise
at points where the corridors joined again. parties were able to elude
each other for the space of half an hour without going beyond the
ï¿½knownï¿½ ground.

by-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the mouth
of the cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot with tallow
drippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted with the success of
the day. then they were astonished to find

ï¿½do it _now_? and company there? look here--iï¿½ll get suspicious of you,
first thing you know. no--weï¿½ll wait till the lights are out--thereï¿½s no
hurry.ï¿½

huck felt that a silence was going to ensue--a thing still more awful
than any amount of murderous talk; so he held his breath and stepped
gingerly back; planted his foot carefully and firmly, after balancing,
one-legged, in a precarious way and almost toppling over, first on one
side and then on the other. he took another step back, with the same
elaboration and the same risks; then another and another, and--a twig
snapped under his foot! his breath stopped and he listened. there was no
sound--the stillness was perfect. his gratitude was measureless. now he
turned in his tracks, between the walls of sumach bushes--turned
himself as carefully as if he were a ship--and then stepped quickly but
cautiously along. when he emerged at the quarry he felt secure, and
so he picked u

more visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for a couple
of hours more.

there was no sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but everybody
was early at church. the stirring event was well canvassed. news came
that not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered. when the
sermon was finished, judge thatcherï¿½s wife dropped alongside of mrs.
harper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said:

ï¿½is my becky going to sleep all day? i just expected she would be tired
to death.ï¿½

ï¿½your becky?ï¿½

ï¿½yes,ï¿½ with a startled look--ï¿½didnï¿½t she stay with you last night?ï¿½

ï¿½why, no.ï¿½

mrs. thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as aunt polly,
talking briskly with a friend, passed by. aunt polly said:

would say cheerily:

ï¿½oh, itï¿½s all right. this ainï¿½t the one, but weï¿½ll come to it right
away!ï¿½

but he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and presently began
to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random, in desperate hope of
finding the one that was wanted. he still said it was ï¿½all right,ï¿½ but
there was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their
ring and sounded just as if he had said, ï¿½all is lost!ï¿½ becky clung to
his side in an anguish of fear, and tried hard to keep back the tears,
but they would come. at last she said:

ï¿½oh, tom, never mind the bats, letï¿½s go back that way! we seem to get
worse and worse off all the time.ï¿½

ï¿½listen!ï¿½ said he.

profound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings were
conspicuous in the hush. tom shouted. the call went echoing down
the empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that
resembled a ripple of mocking laughter.

ï¿½oh, donï¿½t do it

the distant shoutings were growing more distant!
a moment or two more and they had gone altogether. the heart-sinking
misery of it! tom whooped until he was hoarse, but it was of no use. he
talked hopefully to becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no
sounds came again.

the children groped their way back to the spring. the weary time dragged
on; they slept again, and awoke famished and woe-stricken. tom believed
it must be tuesday by this time.

now an idea struck him. there were some side passages near at hand. it
would be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the
heavy time in idleness. he took a kite-line from his pocket, tied it to
a projection, and he and becky started, tom in the lead, unwinding the
line as he groped along. at the end of twenty steps the corridor ended
in a ï¿½jumping-off place.ï¿½ tom got down on his knees and felt below,
and then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands
conveniently; he made an effort to stretch yet a l

ead, and a dozen skiff-loads of
men were on their way to mcdougalï¿½s cave, and the ferryboat, well filled
with passengers, soon followed. tom sawyer was in the skiff that bore
judge thatcher.

when the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in
the dim twilight of the place. injun joe lay stretched upon the ground,
dead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing
eyes had been fixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer
of the free world outside. tom was touched, for he knew by his own
experience how this wretch had suffered. his pity was moved, but
nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security, now,
which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated
before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day
he lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast.

injun joeï¿½s bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two. the great
foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and h

acked through, with
tedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock formed a
sill outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought
no effect; the only damage done was to the knife itself. but if there
had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless
still, for if the beam had been wholly cut away injun joe could not have
squeezed his body under the door, and he knew it. so he had only hacked
that place in order to be doing something--in order to pass the weary
time--in order to employ his tortured faculties. ordinarily one could

well-gnawed bones of two or three fowls. but there
was no moneybox. the lads searched and researched this place, but in
vain. tom said:

ï¿½he said _under_ the cross. well, this comes nearest to being under the
cross. it canï¿½t be under the rock itself, because that sets solid on the
ground.ï¿½

they searched everywhere once more, and then sat down discouraged. huck
could suggest nothing. by-and-by tom said:

ï¿½lookyhere, huck, thereï¿½s footprints and some candle-grease on the clay
about one side of this rock, but not on the other sides. now, whatï¿½s
that for? i bet you the money _is_ under the rock. iï¿½m going to dig in
the clay.ï¿½

ï¿½that ainï¿½t no bad notion, tom!ï¿½ said huck with animation.

tomï¿½s ï¿½real barlowï¿½ was out at once, and he had not dug four inches
before he struck wood.

ï¿½hey, huck!--you hear that?ï¿½

huck began to dig and scratch now. some boards were soon uncovered and
removed. they had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock.
tom got into thi

ï¿½yes. well, sheï¿½s ben good friends to me, anyway.ï¿½

ï¿½all right, then. what do you want to be afraid for?ï¿½

this question was not entirely answered in huckï¿½s slow mind before he
found himself pushed, along with tom, into mrs. douglasï¿½ drawing-room.
mr. jones left the wagon near the door and followed.

the place was grandly lighted, and everybody that was of any consequence
in the village was there. the thatchers were there, the harpers, the
rogerses, aunt polly, sid, mary, the minister, the editor, and a great
many more, and all dressed in their best. the widow received the boys
as heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings. they
were covered with clay and candle-grease. aunt polly blushed crimson
with humiliation, and frowned and shook her head at tom. nobody suffered
half as much as the two boys did, however. mr. jones said:

say--ainï¿½t this grease and clay, on your clothes?ï¿½

ï¿½now, mr. siddy, you jist ï¿½tend to your own business. whatï¿½s all this
blowout about, anyway?ï¿½

ï¿½itï¿½s one of the widowï¿½s parties that sheï¿½s always having. this time
itï¿½s for the welshman and his sons, on account of that scrape they
helped her out of the other ni

ght. and say--i can tell you something, if
you want to know.ï¿½

ï¿½well, what?ï¿½

ï¿½why, old mr. jones is going to try to spring something on the people
here tonight, but i overheard him tell auntie today about it, as a
secret, but i reckon itï¿½s not much of a secret now. everybody knows--the
widow, too, for all she tries to let on she donï¿½t. mr. jones was bound
huck should be here--couldnï¿½t get along with his grand secret without
huck, you know!ï¿½

ï¿½secret about what, sid?ï¿½

ï¿½about huck tracking the robbers to the widowï¿½s. i reckon mr. jones was
going to make a grand time over his surprise, but i bet you it will drop
pretty flat.ï¿½

sid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way.

ï¿½sid, was it you that told?ï¿½

ï¿½oh, never mind who it was. _somebody_ told--thatï¿½s enough.ï¿½

ï¿½sid, thereï¿½s only one person in this town mean enough to do that, and
thatï¿½s you. if you had been in huckï¿½s place youï¿½d ï¿½aï¿½ sneaked down the
hill and never to

things, and you canï¿½t bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones.
there--no thanks, as the widow saysï¿½--and tom cuffed sidï¿½s ears and helped
him to the door with several kicks. ï¿½now go and tell auntie if you
dare--and tomorrow youï¿½ll catch it!ï¿½

some minutes later the widowï¿½s guests were at the supper-table, and a
dozen children were propped up at little side-tables in the same room,
after the fashion of that country and that day. at the proper time mr.
jones made his little speech, in which he thanked the widow for the
honor she was doing himself and his sons, but said that there was
another person whose modesty--

and so forth and so on. he sprung his secret about huckï¿½s share in
the adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of, but the
surprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and
effusive as it might have

nothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept
back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke. but
the silence was a little awkward. tom broke it:

ï¿½huckï¿½s got money. maybe you donï¿½t believe it, but heï¿½s got lots of it.
oh, you neednï¿½t smile--i reckon i can show you. you just wait a minute.ï¿½

tom ran out of doors. the company looked at each other with a perplexed
interest--and inquiringly at huck, who was tongue-tied.

ï¿½sid, what ails tom?ï¿½ said aunt polly. ï¿½he--well, there ainï¿½t ever any
making of that boy out. i never--ï¿½

tom entered, struggling with the weight of his sacks, and aunt polly
did not finish her sentence. tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the
table and said:

ï¿½there--what did i tell you? half of itï¿½s huckï¿½s and half of itï¿½s mine!ï¿½

the spectacle took the general breath away. all gazed, nobody spoke for
a moment. then there was a unanimous call for an explanation. tom said

interest. there was scarcely an interruption from any one to break the
charm of its flow. when he had finished, mr. jones said:

ï¿½i thought i had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion, but it
donï¿½t amount to anything now. this one makes it sing mighty small, iï¿½m
willing to allow.ï¿½

the money was counted. the sum amounted to a little over twelve thousand
dollars. it was more than any one present had ever seen at one time
before, though several persons were there who were worth considerably
more than that in property.




chapter xxxv

the reader may rest satisfied that tomï¿½s and huckï¿½s windfall made a
mighty stir in the poor little village of st. petersburg. so vast a
sum, all in actual cash, seemed next to incredible. it was talked
about, gloated over, glorified, until the reason of many of the citizens
tottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement. every ï¿½hauntedï¿½
 house in st. petersburg and the neighboring villages was dissected,
plank by plank, and its

to go up in the attic and rip out awhile, every day, to git a taste

she wouldnï¿½t let me yell, she wouldnï¿½t let me gape, nor stretch, nor

injury]--ï¿½and dad fetch it, she prayed all the time! i never see such a

going to open, and iï¿½d a had to go to it--well, i wouldnï¿½t stand _that_,
tom. looky-here, tom, being rich ainï¿½t what itï¿½s cracked up to be. itï¿½s
just worry and worry, and sweat and sweat, and a-wishing you was dead

i ainï¿½t ever going to shake ï¿½em any more. tom, i wouldnï¿½t ever got into

try this thing just a while longer youï¿½ll come to like it.ï¿½

ï¿½like it! yes--the way iï¿½d like a hot stove if i was to set on it long
enough. no, tom, i wonï¿½t be rich, and i wonï¿½t live in them cussed
smothery houses. i like the woods, and the river, and hogsheads, and
iï¿½ll stick to ï¿½em, too. blame it all! just as weï¿½d got guns, and a cave,
