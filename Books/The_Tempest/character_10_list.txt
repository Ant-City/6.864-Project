Boatswain - 
                Appearing
only in the first and last scenes, the Boatswain is vigorously
good-natured. He seems competent and almost cheerful in the shipwreck
scene, demanding practical help rather than weeping and praying.
And he seems surprised but not stunned when he awakens from a long
sleep at the end of the play.
