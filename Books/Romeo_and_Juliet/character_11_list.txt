Benvolio - 
                Montague's
nephew, Romeo's cousin and thoughtful friend, he makes a genuine
effort to defuse violent scenes in public places, though Mercutio
accuses him of having a nasty temper in private. He spends most
of the play trying to help Romeo get his mind off Rosaline, even
after Romeo has fallen in love with Juliet.
