in a deliberate parody of the traditional white representation of the loyal

has, remained in the decaying butler mansion taking care of their dogs. ‚Äúyou
loved those white folks that much?‚Äù milkman asks circe (246) only to learn
that what truly motivates her is the desire for revenge, the wish to turn the
tables by returning white contempt with black countercontempt.
contempt, which combines the affect of anger with dissmell, underlies
white prejudice against blacks, as shame theorists have observed. the
‚Äúfacial scene in contempt is the sneer, which is a learned transformation of
dissmell,‚Äù gershen kaufman writes, drawing on the observations of silvan

historical reconstruction that quentin attempts, but she gives him far more

one that shreve abruptly forces upon quentin.5 milkman‚Äôs community also
provides him with more reliable sources of information, and from that community
he gets a much more solid sense of the past, in various ways, than
quentin ever can. milkman‚Äôs first confirmation comes from circe. when
he visits her, she fills in many of the blank and confused areas of the family
history that he has begun to assemble based on pilate‚Äôs and his father‚Äôs
partial revelations. from her, milkman learns the names of sing and jake

in milkman‚Äôs saga. early in song of solomon,
milkman describes his mother as ‚Äútoo insubstantial, too shadowy for love.‚Äù
as a result, he has never thought of her as ‚Äúa person, a separate individual,
with a life apart from allowing or interfering with his own‚Äù (75). milkman‚Äôs
attitude later changes drastically, and a large part of his understanding evolves
from his learning not simply to hear but to listen and, more importantly, to
understand. during their conversation in chapter ten, circe tells milkman,
‚Äúyou don‚Äôt listen to people. your ear is on your head, but it‚Äôs not connected to
your brain‚Äù (247). milkman appears to take this admonition to heart because
shortly thereafter he begins to treat people quite differently. nancy ellen
batty convincingly argues that when circe teaches milkman to hear, she acts
as a revision of faulkner‚Äôs clytie, sutpen‚Äôs mulatto daughter whom quentin
finds guarding the crumbling sutpen mansion when he escorts rosa upon
her fateful return

 to that house. batty points out that quentin does not listen
to clytie in absalom, absalom! (84‚Äì85), and she feels that morrison reworks
the clytie figure by having circe successfully teach milkman how to listen
(89). during the hunt in shalimar, circe‚Äôs lesson takes hold as milkman realizes
the self-centered nature of his attitude and begins to see things from the
viewpoint of others. for instance, he thinks, ‚Äúwhy shouldn‚Äôt his parents tell
him their personal problems? if not him, then who?‚Äù and muses that hagar
‚Äúhad a right to try to kill him‚Äù for the way he betrayed her (song 276‚Äì77). in

finally begins understanding people instead of simply objectifying them.
in preparation for this impending connection to his distinctly oral history,
milkman begins to listen carefully to the hunter‚Äôs signals, sounds he
likens to ‚Äúwhat there was before language. before things were written down‚Äù
(song 278). as he begins to reflect upon his own life with greater clarity, the
import of what guitar earlier said about the peacock becomes clear: ‚Äúcan‚Äôt

you down‚Äù (179). in the dark of the hunt, milkman begins to give up the
metaphorical shit that weighs him down and prepares for his own upcoming
flight. as marilyn sanders mobley notes, milkman begins to respond to
‚Äúthe very voices he had been conditioned to ignore under the discipline of
patriarchal hegemony‚Äù (61). as he learns to hear those voices, the ones his
misunderstanding with circe taught him to listen for, he becomes capable
of the sort of reciprocal behavior that he displays with sweet in the bath
scene (song 285). this capacity for genuine feeling and reciprocity ultimately 
156 lorie watkins fulton
culminates in the connection that he feels to pilate at novel‚Äôs end. and morrison
gently guides her readers through a similar process by forcing them to
shed their dehumanizing tendencies as milkman sheds his. morrison spoke
to this when she said in an interview with thom

milkman initially resists engaging with his past in any critical, meaningful
way, and by chapter eight, he actually runs from it when he feels the need
to ‚Äúbeat a path away from his parents‚Äô past, which was also their present and
which was threatening to become his present as well‚Äù (180).
however, after circe teaches milkman how to listen and hear, and the
‚Äúshit‚Äù that weighs him down begins to fall away, milkman stops running and
begins to cultivate an understanding of his past. morrison charts this constructive
change by employing milkman‚Äôs watch as a symbol of it. when he
realizes that grace failed to give his watch back to him during that initial
visit with susan byrd, he remarks, ‚Äúdamn, . . . i‚Äôm losing everything‚Äù (294).

a connection with his past, and in her powerful role as guide, she stands in
stark opposition to macon dead.9 pilate exists as part conjure woman, part
rebel, and part original woman. like the eve of the creation story, she has

and the fury and absalom, absalom!. for example, willis contrasts pilate‚Äôs exclusively
female household with the one formed in absalom, absalom! by clytie, judith, and
rosa during the civil war (41). batty also compares faulkner‚Äôs clytie to morrison‚Äôs
circe and maintains that ‚Äúmorrison perhaps ‚Äòhears‚Äô clytie in a different register

deeply implicated in issues of narrativity: this is a story about naming, and
its characters frequently bear names which denote their narrative function,
for example pilate, who acts as a guide to the protagonist milkman dead, or
sweet, the woman he wins after completing his ordeal in shalimar. certain
names allude to other stories: hagar, ruth, rebecca, and first corinthians
have obvious biblical associations in keeping with the novel‚Äôs title. the midwife,
circe, a pivotal figure in the puzzles of naming and narrative around
which the novel is structured, is the only character to bear a name from
greek mythology. yet while she so obviously signifies a homeric intertext
and the patrilineal literary history that is its legacy, circe simultaneously
subverts this tradition, sending the protagonist on a journey that resembles
the master narrative, but is destabilized by other discourses. the integrity
of the narrative is accordingly stretched between a syst

and women‚Äôs stories compete for authority, western mythic traditions are
contested by african folklore, and the myth of the catabasis, the descent
to the underworld, is challenged by a fantasy of ascent manifested in the
folktale of the man who could fly.
in this essay i focus on how morrison employs the figure of circe to
position her novel both within and beyond the classical tradition of the catabatic
narrative. toni morrison graduated with a minor in classics from howard
university in 1953, and it is obvious that her academic training informed
song of solomon.

work, which explores the experience of black american women, by its focus
on a central male character, milkman dead. milkman, the son of a prosperous

 is narrated as a series
of events ‚Äúresonating with symbolic and archetypal significance,‚Äù3 beginning
with a miraculous birth (the first black baby to be born in mercy hospital),
proceeding to a period of alienation from his family, and culminating in a quest
ostensibly for gold, but also for his genealogy. other characters in the novel can
be mapped onto this mythic grid. milkman‚Äôs childhood friend and eventual
antagonist, guitar, functions as an alter ego, while women such as pilate and
circe correspond to the positions of helpers and threshold guardians.4
this early literary criticism identified milkman‚Äôs quest as an exponent of
a rankian mythic structure, which valorizes the male initiation pattern. this
is a completely legitimate reading of the text, but one with limitations. the
resolution of the novel, which implicates a female oral tradition and african
folktale, suggests a more subversive approach to the familiar mythic structure.
later scholarship posits that morrison mani

pulates the male initiation theme
to expose it as problematic. gerry brenner and michael awkward recognized
that morrison employs the mythic archetype to articulate a male narrative

narrative of a hero‚Äôs quest.5 i would like to expand upon this reading by providing
a closer inspection of the novel‚Äôs classical antecedents with special
emphasis on circe. my objective here is to facilitate a better understanding
of how morrison manipulates and subverts the catabatic traditions connected
with coming of age or initiation narratives and how she situates the obligatory
descent to the underworld with relation to the story of flight.
the catabasis of odysseus functions as a prototype for this narrative
tradition, and as a model for morrison‚Äôs novel: the hero experiences a death

which is symbolized by his trip to hades, where he encounters
the shades of figures from the heroic past.6 he is symbolically reborn when
he is cast ashore, naked and alone, at scheria, and he works towards recuperating
his identity when he finally arrives home in ithaca.7 circe plays
an important role in odysseus‚Äô visit to the underworld. after spending a
year of indolence on her island, the hero prepares to leave, only to be told by
circe that he must make the descent. she provides information about how
to accomplish the catabasis, and is an integral part of the nekyia.

her role in song of solomon is obviously modeled on this homeric tradition,

without considering how her role in the development not only of milkman,
but also of his father, macon dead, and his aunt pilate, resonates with her
role in the odyssey. mobley, however, does make an important point when

the men: that the sack contains rocks from different places pilate had visited,

police, human bones. but whose bones? for when the skin has melted

ther‚Äôs misogyny, milkman‚Äôs treatment of women
is hardly surprising. he callously dumps his cousin hagar, after a long-term
relationship, with a thank-you note and a gift, he interferes in his sister‚Äôs love
affair, and he robs his aunt. milkman‚Äôs quest for knowledge and identity, then,
is a gradual movement toward a more decent relationship with women, and a
value system more in line with that of pilate rather than his father. the figure
at the threshold of his development is the uncanny circe.
circe is first named by macon when he starts to recount his history to
milkman. the narration is in response to milkman‚Äôs forbidden visit to macon‚Äôs
estranged sister pilate, and to her version of their shared childhood experience.
the name of circe surfaces like a specter, as macon reminisces about
life on his father‚Äôs farm. he remembers the animals named after humans, and
significantly, a pig named general lee, who was delicious.
circe made up the best pot of maws she ever cooked. huh!

in chapter 10 milkman encounters circe for himself when he visits danville
in search of the gold that he believes is in the prospector‚Äôs cave. his
investigations lead him to the butler mansion, where circe concealed
macon and pilate. although his grandfather‚Äôs old friends have vivid
memories of circe, they assume she is dead, since she was ‚Äúa hundred when
i was a boy‚Äù (237). the accent on her extreme old age is suggestive of the
antiquity of the tale from which circe is imported (book 10 of the odyssey).
and even if her homeric associations have not been emphasized at
this point (although general lee the pig should give us pause), milkman‚Äôs
encounter with her will be infused with that anc

the decaying butler mansion, is hidden behind bushes, much like the lush
greenery of aeaea; indeed the inaccessibility of the place makes it a veritable
island.
circe is a strange combination of appalling decrepitude and sexual
power. like the ancient tale she is in decline, but still possessed of a compelling
allure. as she embraces milkman, mistaking him for his father, the young
man finds himself simultaneously aroused and disgusted. deathless she may
be, but she is by no means ageless. nonetheless milkman‚Äôs first encounter
with her is sexually charged; she is like a figure from a dream, a sexual power
which is again reminiscent of the homeric circe who

 keeps odysseus for a
year as her lover. like her epic predecessor, who supplicates the hero soon
after meeting him (after failing to enchant him with her potions, od. 10.323),
circe immediately makes close physical contact with milkman. their embrace
is only interrupted by her throng of dogs. circe is also mistress of the animals;
her strange weimaraners with human eyes recall the men turned into wolves,
who fawned on odysseus‚Äô companions ‚Äúlike dogs fawn on their masters‚Äù (od.
10.215‚Äì216). whether they are in fact her former masters is never specified.
reverend cooper had advised milkman that ‚Äúany evening up left to do, circe

full details of her retribution.

goddess.18 she is, after odysseus has overpowered her, benevolent and
nurturing, attributes she passes down to her twentieth-century counterpart
who succors macon and pilate after the murder of their father. associated
with her fecundating qualities is her role as a midwife; she delivered most
of the people in denford, including macon and pilate. it is circe to whom
odysseus returns after his visit to the underworld, so in a sense she too
functions as a midwife in his rebirth. her nurturance extends to her tutelary
capacity: she not only tells odysseus that he must make his trip to hades,
but also, once he returns, explains what he must do for the remainder of
his voyage. milkman similarly learns important information from circe:

from circe he hears the strange history of his grandfather‚Äôs corpse,
which his father had buried in a shallow grave. the body had been dislodged,
washed upstream, and eventually put in the cave, without a proper burial. the
unburied corpse is a feature of odyssey 11 and aeneid 6. it is as if elpinor and
palinurus open a portal for the heroes‚Äô trips to the underworld. milkman
declares that he will bury the bones, unaware that they are in pilate‚Äôs possession.

of the trip far easier. now inside the cave, he manages to find the pit, but it
does not contain the gold that he set out to find, nor does it hold the bones
that he claimed to want to bury. frustrated and exhausted, milkman emerges
from this cavern with a ravenous hunger, as if his spiritual starvation has been
physically manifested, and with a damaged watch, its hands twisted as if time
has somehow become distorted.
circe seems to be able to change the quality of time. milkman‚Äôs episode
with her has been, despite his disappointed expectations, a transformative
experience. she is a liminal figure who mediates between death and life, but
she also sits at the portal between two stories, not only the two sections of the
novel, but also the novel and the epic tradition. under her direction time for

and is then reborn. milkman has of cou

if milkman‚Äôs damaged watch signifies a departure from linear chronology,
it also announces his release from quotidian temporality. he has
been sent forth from a mundane existence as his father‚Äôs minion into an
epic landscape where his identity will be transformed. and transformation
is what circe is all about. when she dispatches milkman to the cave, she
effectively sends him into a narrative matrix, a loaded symbol of other stories.
the cave evokes the odyssean tradition, which gave birth to aeneas‚Äô
descent to the underworld (also through a cave, aen. 6.237‚Äì242),21 and
those of dante and milton. milkman will emerge from the cave reborn
into a different world than the one he left behind; he will enter a mythic
continuum in which his view of the world and of himself will be drastical

so often does in morrison‚Äôs fiction, the past, correlative to his return to the
womb. his encounter with circe has emphasized a different sense of time,
what julia kristeva has called ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs time,‚Äù circular and eternal, a temporality
which circumscribes a landscape strongly inflected as feminine but
which is also deeply resonant of established mythology.22 in her revision of
the catabasis morrison has emphasized the strong connection between the
midwife circe and the womb-like earth, and set aside the wise old man,
teiresias, whom odysseus had to consult.23

it is during the last that milkman experiences his epiphany in the woods,

while milkman‚Äôs experience is charted along a narrative axis that corresponds
to a male bildungsroman, there is a calculated twist in the narrative
journey. we have noted how the encounter with circe marks the landscape
as feminine, the very landscape where milkman will undergo his rite of passage

to the midwife circe, who stood at the threshold of this part of the story, and
whose name relates her to this cyclical quality.31 in his optimistic reading of
her role page suggests that milkman ‚Äúreaches the womb of his family (the
cave) by embracing the terrifying but guiding circe who models milkman‚Äôs
quest by fusing western and african-american cultural traditions, life and
death, and present and past.‚Äù32 from page‚Äôs critical perspective milkman is

and the two cultural traditions, african and european, which are in harmony
at the end of the tale. but from the perspective of a feminist classicist,
the synthesis is perhaps not so well knit. there are significant fissures in the
text which remain unresolved at its conclusion, fissures which are opened by
circe, who signifies the mythic narrative of the hero‚Äôs quest, but who simultaneously
deconstructs it. on one level of meaning, as the careful citations of
the sojourn on aeaea make clear, circe functions as she does in the odyssey:
she is an initiatrix who sets the hero on his path to symbolic rebirth‚Äîbut not
death, for he is already dead. her name alone, singular in its homeric allusion,
denotes the male heroic pattern with its linear androcentric emphasis.
yet because she has existed in other

narratives, including epics, poetry, and
novels, she also represents a never-ending cycle of stories. within the compass
of the novel circe is linked with other female voices who convey milkman‚Äôs
history: pilate who sings the song of solomon and recounts her family history,
and susan byrd who completes the tale. circe‚Äôs position in this respect
is dually coded. her name denotes the androcentric myth, yet she is an agent
who allows the hero to seek for something more than his masculine identity,
his place in the parade of heroes who make the necessary trip to the underworld
with the help of female guardians. this dualism is connoted in part by
her gorgeous voice, the voice of a sexy young woman. as narrator, odysseus
mentions circe‚Äôs voice several times; she sings in a sweet or clear voice as she

circe is possessed of a ‚Äústrong young cultivated voice‚Äù (242), the ‚Äúmellifluent

voice of a twenty year old girl‚Äù (240). in the homeric context female voices
denote danger; the sirens are the most obvious example of this.33 but in a
novel that reverberates with the voices of women, circe‚Äôs voice has a different
timbre. one way of accounting for the discrepancy between her corpse-like
appearance and youthful tones might be that her seductive voice betokens a
new story enclosed within an ancient tradition.
circe‚Äôs activities in the butler mansion contribute to the sense that the
old must be disassembled before the new can take its place. it had been her
job to clean and maintain the opulent household with its priceless tapestries
and imported marble. now that the family is ex

master narrative, and to a certain extent she does, but she also disrupts that
narrative, which is replaced by deconstructive reading of a literary edifice, the
hero‚Äôs quest.
