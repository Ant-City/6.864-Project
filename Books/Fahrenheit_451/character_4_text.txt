" 

"no, you don't," she said, in awe. 

he felt she was walking in a circle about him, turning him end for end, shaking him quietly, and 

emptying his pockets, without once moving herself. 

"kerosene," he said, because the silence had lengthened, "is nothing but perfume to me." 

"does it seem like that, really?" 

"of course. why not?" 

she gave herself time to think of it. "i don't know." she turned to face the sidewalk going toward 

their homes. "do you mind if i walk back with you? i'm clarisse mcclellan." 

"clarisse. guy montag. come along. what are you doing out so late wandering around? how 

old are you?" 

they walked in the warm-cool blowing night on the silvered pavement and there was the faintest 

breath of fresh apricots and strawberries in the air, and he looked around and realized this was 

quite impossible, so late in the year. 

there was only the girl walking with him now, her face bright as snow in the moonlight, and he 

knew she was working his questions around, seeking the

in it. it was not the hysterical light of 
electricity but-what? but the strangely comfortable and rare and gently flattering light of the 
candle. one time, when he was a child, in a power-failure, his mother had found and lit a last 
candle and there had been a brief hour of rediscovery, of such illumination that space lost its vast 
dimensions and drew comfortably around them, and they, mother and son, alone, transformed, 
hoping that the power might not come on again too soon .... 
and then clarisse mcclellan said: 

"do you mind if i ask? how long have you worked at being a fireman?" 
"since i was twenty, ten years ago." 
"do you ever read any of the books you bum?" 
he laughed. "that's against the law!" 
"oh. of course." 

"it's fine work. monday bum millay, wednesday whitman, friday faulkner, burn 'em to ashes, 
then bum the ashes. that's our official slogan." 

they walked still further and the girl said, "is it true that long ago firemen put fires out instead of 
going to start them?" 

"no. ho

and her lips were very fresh and full of colour and they looked soft and 
relaxed. someone else's blood there. if only someone else's flesh and brain and memory. if only 
they could have taken her mind along to the dry-cleaner's and emptied the pockets and steamed 
and cleansed it and reblocked it and brought it back in the morning. if only . . . 
he got up and put back the curtains and opened the windows wide to let the night air in. it was 
two o'clock in the morning. was it only an hour ago, clarisse mcclellan in the street, and him 
coming in, and the dark room and his foot kicking the little crystal bottle? only an hour, but the 
world had melted down and sprung up in a new and colourless form. 

laughter blew across the moon-coloured lawn from the house of clarisse and her father and 
mother and the uncle who smiled so quietly and so earnestly. above all, their laughter was 
relaxed and hearty and not forced in any way, coming from the house that was so brightly lit this 
late at night while all t

k was cold, too. 

montag hesitated, "was-was it always like this? the firehouse, our work? i mean, well, once 

upon a time..." 

"once upon a time!" beatty said. "what kind of talk is that?" 

fool, thought montag to himself, you'll give it away. at the last fire, a book of fairy tales, he'd 

glanced at a single line. "i mean," he said, "in the old days, before homes were completely 

fireproofed " suddenly it seemed a much younger voice was speaking for him. he opened his 

mouth and it was clarisse mcclellan saying, "didn't firemen prevent fires rather than stoke them 

up and get them going?" 

"that's rich!" stoneman and black drew forth their rulebooks, which also contained brief 

histories of the firemen of america, and laid them out where montag, though long familiar with 

them, might read: 

"established, 1790, to burn english-influenced books in the colonies. first fireman: benjamin 

franklin." 

rule 1 . answer the alarm swiftly. 

2. start the fire swiftly. 

3. burn everything.

the fireworks died in the parlour behind mildred. she had stopped talking at the same time; a 
miraculous coincidence. montag held his breath. 

"there was a girl next door," he said, slowly. "she's gone now, i think, dead. i can't even 
remember her face. but she was different. how?how did she happen?" 

beatty smiled. "here or there, that's bound to occur. clarisse mcclellan? we've a record on her 
family. we've watched them carefully. heredity and environment are funny things. you can't rid 
yourselves of all the odd ducks in just a few years. the home environment can undo a lot you try 
to do at school. that's why we've lowered the kindergarten age year after year until now we're 
almost snatching them from the cradle. we had some false alarms on the mcclellans, when they 
lived in chicago. never found a book. uncle had a mixed record; anti?social. the girl? she

i saw the damnedest snake in the world the other night. it was 

dead but it was alive. it could see but it couldn't see. you want to see that snake. it's at 

emergency hospital where they filed a report on all the junk the snake got out of you! would 

you like to go and check their file? maybe you'd look under guy montag or maybe under fear or 

war. would you like to go to that house that burnt last night? and rake ashes for the bones of the 

woman who set fire to her own house! what about clarisse mcclellan, where do we look for 

her? the morgue! listen!" 

the bombers crossed the sky and crossed the sky over the house, gasping, murmuring, whistling 

like an immense, invisible fan, circling in emptiness. 

"jesus god," said montag. "every hour so many damn things in the sky! how in hell did those 

bombers get up there every single second of our lives ! why doesn't someone want to talk about 

it? we've started and won two atomic wars since 1960. is it because we're having so much fun at

 the dynamite in her house, stick by stick. but he was not angry now, only exhausted 

and bewildered with himself. he carried the books into the backyard and hid them in the bushes 

near the alley fence. for tonight only, he thought, in case she decides to do any more burning. 

he went back through the house. "mildred?" he called at the door of the darkened bedroom. 

there was no sound. 



outside, crossing the lawn, on his way to work, he tried not to see how completely dark and 
deserted clarisse mcclellan's house was .... 

on the way downtown he was so completely alone with his terrible error that he felt the 
necessity for the strange warmness and goodness that came from a familiar and gentle voice 
speaking in the night. already, in a few short hours, it seemed that he had known faber a 
lifetime. now he knew that he was two people, that he was above all montag, who knew 
nothing, who did not even know himself a fool, but only suspected it. and he knew that he was 
also the old man who talked
