as sitting on the sofa, feeding the baby his apricots out of a jar. "the children have been to florida before," the old lady said. "you all ought to take them somewhere else for a change so they would see different parts of the world and be broad. they never have been to east tennessee."

the children's mother didn't seem to hear her but the eight-year-old boy, john wesley, a stocky child with glasses, said, "if you don't want to go to florida, why dontcha stay at home?" he and the little girl, june star, were reading the funny papers on the floor.

"she wouldn't stay at home to be queen for a day," june star said without raising her yellow head.

"yes and what would you do if this fellow, the misfit, caught you?" the grandmother asked.

"i'd smack his face," john wesley said.

"she wouldn't stay at home for a million bucks," june star said. "afraid she'd miss something. she has to go everywhere we go."

june star said her hair was naturally curly.

the next morning the grandmother was the first one in the car, ready to go. she had her big black valise that looked like the head of a hippopotamus in one corner, and underneath it she was hiding a basket with pitty sing, the cat, in it. she didn't intend for the cat to be left alone in the house for three days because he would miss her too much and she was afraid he might brush against one of the gas burners and accidentally asphyxiate himself. her son, bai

ley, didn't like to arrive at a motel with a cat.

she sat in the middle of the back seat with john wesley and june star on either side of her. bailey and the children's mother and the baby sat in front and they left atlanta at eight forty-five with the mileage on the car at 55890. the grandmother wrote this down because she thought it would be interesting to say how many miles they had been when they got back. it took them twenty minutes to reach the outskirts of the city.

the old lady settled herself comfortably, removing her white cotton gloves and putting them up with her purse on the shelf in front of the b

silver-white sunlight and the meanest of them sparkled. the children were reading comic magazines and their mother had gone back to sleep.

"let's go through georgia fast so we won't have to look at it much," john wesley said.

"if i were a little boy," said the grandmother, "i wouldn't talk about my native state that way. tennessee has the mountains and georgia has the hills."

"tennessee is just a hillbilly dumping ground," john wesley said, "and georgia is a lousy state too."

"you said it," june star said.

"in my time," said the grandmother, folding her thin veined fingers, "children were more respectful of their native states and their parents and everything else. people did right then. oh look at the cute little pickaninny!" she said and pointed to a negro child standing in the door of a shack. "wouldn't that make a picture, now?" she asked and they all turned and looked at the little negro out of the back window. he waved.

"he didn't have any britches on," june star said.

the children throw the box and the paper napkins out the window. when there was nothing else to do they played a game by choosing a cloud and making the other two guess what shape it suggested. john wesley took one the shape of a cow and june star guessed a cow and john wesley said, no, an automobile, and june star said he didn't play fair, and they began to slap each other over the grandmother.

the grandmother said she would tell them a story if they would keep quiet. when she told a story, she rolled her eyes and waved her head and was very dramatic. she said once when she was a maiden lady she had been courted by a mr. edgar atkins teagarden from jasper, georgia. she said he was a very good-looking man and a gentleman and that he bro

th hair and eyes lighter than her skin, came and took their order. the children's mother put a dime in the machine and played "the tennessee waltz," and the grandmother said that tune always made her want to dance. she asked bailey if he would like to dance but he only glared at her. he didn't have a naturally sunny disposition like she did and trips made him nervous. the grandmother's brown eyes were very bright. she swayed her head from side to side and pretended she was dancing in her chair. june star said play something she could tap to so the children's mother put in another dime and played a fast number and june star stepped out onto the dance floor and did her tap routine.

"ain't she cute?" red sam's wife said, leaning over the counter. "would you like to come be my little girl?"

"no i certainly wouldn't," june star said. "i wouldn't live in a broken-down place like this for a minion bucks!" and she ran back to the table.

 little twin arbors were still standing. "there was a secret panel in this house," she said craftily, not telling the truth but wishing that she were, "and the story went that all the family silver was hidden in it when sherman came through but it was never found . . ."

"hey!" john wesley said. "let's go see it! we'll find it! we'll poke all the woodwork and find it! who lives there? where do you turn off at? hey pop, can't we turn off there?"

"we never have seen a house with a secret panel!" june star shrieked. "let's go to the house with the secret panel! hey pop, can't we go see the house with the secret panel!"

"it's not far from here, i know," the grandmother said. "it wouldn't take over twenty minutes."

bailey was looking straight ahead. his jaw was as rigid as a horseshoe. "no," he said.

the children began to yell and scream that they wanted to see the house with the secret panel. john wesley kicked the back of the front seat and june star hung over her mother's shoulder and whined

se she had remembered so vividly was not in georgia but in tennessee.

bailey removed the cat from his neck with both hands and flung it out the window against the side of a pine tree. then he got out of the car and started looking for the children's mother. she was sitting against the side of the red gutted ditch, holding the screaming baby, but she only had a cut down her face and a broken shoulder. "we've had an accident!" the children screamed in a frenzy of delight.

"but nobody's killed," june star said with disappointment as the grandmother limped out of the car, her hat still pinned to her head but the broken front brim standing up at a jaunty angle and the violet spray hanging off the side. they all sat down in the ditch, except the children, to recover from the shock. they were all shaking.

"maybe a car will come along," said the children's mother hoarsely.

"i believe i have injured an organ," said the grandmother, pressing her side, but no one answered her. bailey's teeth were clat

"once"," he corrected. "we seen it happen. try their car and see will it run, hiram," he said quietly to the boy with the gray hat.

"what you got that gun for?" john wesley asked. "whatcha gonna do with that gun?"

"lady," the man said to the children's mother, "would you mind calling them children to sit down by you? children make me nervous. i want all you all to sit down right together there where you're at."

"what are you telling us what to do for?" june star asked.

behind them the line of woods gaped like a dark open mouth. "come here," said their mother.

"look here now," bailey began suddenly, "we're in a predicament! we're in . . ."

the grandmother shrieked. she scrambled to her feet and stood staring. "you're the misfit!" she said. "i recognized you at once!"

"yes'm," the man said, smiling slightly as if he were pleased in spite of himself to be known, "but it would have been better for all of you, lady, if yo

 heaving noises as if she couldn't get her breath. "lady," he asked, "would you and that little girl like to step off yonder with bobby lee and hiram and join your husband?"

"yes, thank you," the mother said faintly. her left arm dangled helplessly and she was holding the baby, who had gone to sleep, in the other. "hep that lady up, hiram," the misfit said as she struggled to climb out of the ditch, "and bobby lee, you hold onto that little girl's hand."

"i don't want to hold hands with him," june star said. "he reminds me of a pig."

the fat boy blushed and laughed and caught her by the arm and pulled her off into the woods after hiram and her mother.

alone with the misfit, the grandmother found that she had lost her voice. there was not a cloud in the sky nor any sun. there was nothing around her but woods. she wanted to tell him that he must pray. she opened and closed her mouth several times before anything came out. finally she found herself saying, "jesus. jesus," meaning, jesus will h
