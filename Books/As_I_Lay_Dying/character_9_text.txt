en her and darl that the understanding and the true love was. he just 
looked at her, not even coming in where she could see him and get upset, knowing 
that anse was driving him away and he would never see her again. he said 
nothing, just looking at her. 

"what you want, darl?" dewey dell said, not stopping the fan, speaking up 
quick, keeping even him from her. he didn't answer. he just stood and looked at 
his dying mother, his heart too full for words. 

dewey dell 

the first time me and lafe picked on down the row. pa dassent sweat because he 
will catch his death from the sickness so everybody that comes to help us. and 
jewel dont care about anything he is not kin to us in caring, not care-kin. and 
cash like sawing the long hot sad yellow days up into planks and nailing them to 
something. and pa thinks because neighbors will always treat one another that 
way because he has always been too busy letting neighbors do for him to find 
out. and i did not think that darl would, that

 sits at the supper table with his 
eyes gone further than the food and the lamp, full of the land dug out of his 
skull and the holes filled with distance beyond the land. 
we picked on down the row, the woods getting closer and closer and the 
secret shade, picking on into the secret shade with my sack and lafe's sack. 
because i said will i or wont i when the sack was half full because i said if 
the sack is full when we get to the woods it wont be me. i said if it dont mean 
for me to do it the sack will not be full and i will turn up the next row but if 
the sack is full, i cannot help it. it will be that i had to do it all the time 
and i cannot help it. and we picked on toward the secret shade and our eyes 
would drown together touching on his hands and my hands and i didn't say 
anything. i said

 is not any room for , 

anything else important in a big tub of guts, how can it be room in a little tub 

of guts. but i know it is there because god gave women a sign when something has 

happened bad. 

it's because i am alone. if i could just feel it, it would be different, 
because i would not be alone. but if i were not alone, everybody would know it. 
and he could do so much for me, and then i would not be alone. then i could be 
all right alone. 

i would let him come in between me and lafe, like darl came in between me 
and lafe, and so lafe is alone too. he is lafe and i am dewey dell, and when 
mother died i had to go beyond and outside of me and lafe and darl to grieve 
because he could do so much for me and he dont know it. he dont even know it. 
from the back porch i cannot see the barn. then the sound of cash's sawing 
comes in from that way. it is like a dog outside the house, going back and forth 
around the house to whatever door you come to, waiting to come in. he said

him catch him." 

"well. tell them to come to supper." 

i cannot see the barn. i said, i dont know how to worry. i dont know how to cry. 
i tried, but i cant. after a while the sound of the saw comes around, coming 
dark along the ground in the dust-dark. then i can see him, going up and down 
above the plank. 

"you come in to supper," i say. "tell him." he could do everything for me. 
and he dont know it. he is his guts and i am my guts. and i am lafe's guts. 
that's it. i dont see why he didn't stay in town. we are country people, not as 
good as town people. i dont see why he didn't. then i can see the top of the 
barn. the cow stands at the foot of the path, lowing. when i turn back, cash is 
gone. 

i carry the buttermilk in. pa and cash and he are at the table. 

"where's that big fish bud caught, sister?" he says. 

i set the milk on the table. "i never had no time to cook it." 

"plain turnip greens is mighty spindling eating for a ma

d with empty seeing, the pine clumps 

blotched up the tilted slope, secret and waiting. 

the cow in silhouette against the door nuzzles at the silhouette of the 

bucket, moaning. 

then i pass the stall. i have almost passed it, i listen to it saying for 

a long time before it can say the word and the listening part is afraid that 



there may not be time to say it i feel my body, my bones and flesh beginning to 
part and open upon the alone, and the process of coming unalone is terrible. 
lafe. lafe. "lafe" lafe. lafe. i lean a little forward, one foot advanced with 
dead walking. i feel the darkness rushing past my breast, past the cow; i begin 
to rush upon the darkness but the cow stops me and the darkness rushes on upon 
the sweet blast of her moaning breath, filled with wood and with silence. 
"vardaman. you, vardaman." 

he comes out of the stall. "you durn little sneak! you durn little sneak!" 
he does not resist; the last of rushing darkness flees whistling away. 
"what? i ai

 that all you wanted?" 

but she just stood there, not looking at me. 

"i got the money to pay you," she said. 

"is it your own, or did he act enough of a man to give you the money?" 

"he give it to me. ten dollars. he said that would be enough." 

"a thousand dollars wouldn't be enough in my store and ten cents wouldn't 

be enough," i said. "you take my advice and go home and tell your pa or your 

brothers if you have any or the first man you come to in the road." 

but she, didn't move. "lafe said i could get it at the drugstore. he said 

to tell you me and him wouldn't never tell nobody you sold it to us." 

"and i just wish your precious lafe had come for it himself; that's what i 

wish. i dont know: i'd have had a little respect for him then. and you can go 

back and tell him i said soâ€” if he aint halfway to texas by now, which i dont 

doubt. me, a respectable druggist, that's kept store and raised a family and 

been a church-member for fifty-six years in this town. i'm a

a hard life they have; sometimes a man ... if there can ever be any excuse for 

sin, which it cant be. and then, life wasn't made to be easy on folks: they 

wouldn't ever have any reason to be good and die. "look here," i said. "you get 

that notion out of your head. the lord gave you what you have, even if he did 

use the devil to do it; you let him take it away from you if it's his will to do 

so. you go on back to lafe and you and him take that ten dollars and get married 

with it." 

"lafe said i could get something at the drugstore," she said. 

"then go and get it," i said. "you wont get it here." 

she went out, carrying the package, her feet making a little hissing on 

the floor. she bumbled again at the door and went out. i could see her through 

the glass going on down the street. 

it was albert told me about the rest of it he said the wagon was stopped 

in front of grummet's hardware store, with
