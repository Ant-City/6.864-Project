Cash Bundren - 
                 The
eldest Bundren child and a skilled carpenter. Cash is the paragon
of patience and selflessness, almost to the point of absurdity.
He refuses ever to complain about his broken, festering leg, allowing
the injury to degenerate to the point that he may never walk again. Cash
emerges as one of the novel's few consistently stable characters.
