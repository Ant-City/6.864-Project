  constance. gone to be married! gone to swear a peace!
    false blood to false blood join'd! gone to be friends!
    shall lewis have blanch, and blanch those provinces?
    it is not so; thou hast misspoke, misheard;
    be well advis'd, tell o'er thy tale again.
    it cannot be; thou dost but say 'tis so;
    i trust i may not trust thee, for thy word
    is but the vain breath of a common man:
    believe me i do not believe thee, man;
    i have a king's oath to the contrary.

 jest,
    with my vex'd spirits i cannot take a truce,
    but they will quake and tremble all this day.
    what dost thou mean by shaking of thy head?
    why dost thou look so sadly on my son?
    what means that hand upon that breast of thine?
    why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum,
    like a proud river peering o'er his bounds?
    be these sad signs confirmers of thy words?
    then speak again-not all thy former tale,
    but this one word, whether thy tale be true.
  salisbury. as true as i believe you think them false
    that give you cause to prove my saying true.
  constance. o, if thou teach me to believe this sorrow,
    teach thou this sorrow how to make me die;
    and let belief and life encounter so
    as doth the fury of two desperate men
    which in the very meeting fall and die!

scene 2.

england. king john's palace

enter king john, pembroke, salisbury, and other lords

  king john. here once again we sit, once again crown'd,
    and look'd upon, i hope, with cheerful eyes.
  pembroke. this once again, but that your highness pleas'd,
    was once superfluous: you were crown'd before,
    and that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off,
    the faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt;
    fresh expectation troubled not the land
    with any long'd-for change or better state.
  salisbury. therefore, to be possess'd with double pomp,

to guard a title that was rich before,
    to gild refined gold, to paint the lily,
    to throw a perfume on the violet,
    to smooth the ice, or add another hue
    unto the rainbow, or with taper-light
    to seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,
    is wasteful and ridiculous excess.
  pembroke. but that your royal pleasure must be done,
    this act is as an ancient tale new told
    and, in the last repeating, troublesome,
    being urged at a time unseasonable.
  salisbury. in this the antique and well-noted face
    of plain old form is much disfigured;
    and like a shifted wind unto a sail
    it makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,
    startles and frights consideration,
    makes sound opinion sick, and truth suspected,
    for putting on so new a fashion'd robe.
  pembroke. when workmen strive to do better than well,
    they do confound their skill in covetousness;
    and oftentimes excusing of a fault
    doth make the fault the worse

by th' excuse,
    as patches set upon a little breach
    discredit more in hiding of the fault
    than did the fault before it was so patch'd.
  salisbury. to this effect, before you were new-crown'd,
    we breath'd our counsel; but it pleas'd your highness
    to overbear it; and we are all well pleas'd,
    since all and every part of what we would
    doth make a stand at what your highness will.
  king john. some reasons of this double coronation
    i have possess'd you with, and think them strong;
    and more, more strong, when lesser is my fear,
    i shall indue you with. meantime but ask
    what you would have reform'd that i

  king john. let it be so. i do commit his youth
    to your direction.

                     enter hubert

    [aside]  hubert, what news with you?
  pembroke. this is the man should do the bloody deed:
    he show'd his warrant to a friend of mine;
    the image of a wicked heinous fault
    lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
    doth show the mood of a much troubled breast,
    and i do fearfully believe 'tis done
    what we so fear'd he had a charge to do.
  salisbury. the colour of the king doth come and go
    between his purpose and his conscience,
    like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set.
    his passion is so ripe it needs must break.
  pembroke. and when it breaks, i fear will issue thence
    the foul corruption of a sweet child's death.
  king john. we cannot hold mortality's strong hand.
    good lords, although my will to give is living,
    the suit which you demand is gone and dead:
    he tells us arthur is deceas'd to-night.
 
 
 ___________________________
 
 salisbury. indeed, we fear'd his sickness was past cure.
  pembroke. indeed, we heard how near his death he was,
    before the child himself felt he was sick.
    this must be answer'd either here or hence.
  king john. why do you bend such solemn brows on me?
    think you i bear the shears of destiny?
    have i commandment on the pulse of life?
  salisbury. it is apparent foul-play; and 'tis shame
    that greatness should so grossly offer it.
    so thrive it in your game! and so, farewell.
  pembroke. stay yet, lord salisbury, i'll go with thee
    and find th' inheritance of this poor child,
    his little kingdom of a forced grave.
    that blood which ow'd the breadth of all this isle
    three foot of it doth hold-bad world the while!
    this must not be thus borne: this will break out
    to all our sorrows, and ere long i doubt.

  bastard. the french, my lord; men's mouths are full of it;
    besides, i met lord bigot and lord salisbury,
    with eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,
    and others more, going to seek the grave
    of arthur, whom they say is kill'd to-night
    on your suggestion.
  king john. gentle kinsman, go
    and thrust thyself into their companies.
    i have a way to will their loves again;
    bring them before me.

  king john. nay, but make haste; the better foot before.

  salisbury. the king hath dispossess'd himself of us.
    we will not line his thin bestained cloak
    with our pure honours, nor attend the foot
    that leaves the print of blood where'er it walks.
    return and tell him so. we know the worst.

    the earth had not a hole to hide this deed.
  salisbury. murder, as hating what himself hath done,
    doth lay it open to urge on revenge.
  bigot. or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,
    found it too precious-princely for a grave.
  salisbury. sir richard, what think you? have you beheld,
    or have you read or heard, or could you think?
    or do you almost think, although you see,
    that you do see? could thought, without this object,
    form such another? this is the very top,
    the height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,
    of murder's arms; this is the bloodiest shame,
    the wildest savagery, the vilest stroke,

    which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house,
    doth by the idle comments that it makes
    foretell the ending of mortality.

                   enter pembroke

  pembroke. his highness yet doth speak, and holds belief
    that, being brought into the open air,
    it would allay the burning quality
    of that fell poison which assaileth him.

ath, having prey'd upon the outward parts,
    leaves them invisible, and his siege is now
    against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds
    with many legions of strange fantasies,
    which, in their throng and press to that last hold,
    confound themselves. 'tis strange that death should sing.
    i am the cygnet to this pale faint swan
    who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,
    and from the organ-pipe of frailty sings
    his soul and body to their lasting rest.
  salisbury. be of good comfort, prince; for you are born
    to set a form upon that indigest
    which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.

  king john. ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room;
    it would not out at windows nor at doors.
    there is so hot a summer in my bosom
    that all my bowels crumble up to dust.

ead, one little hair;
    my heart hath one poor string to stay it by,
    which holds but till thy news be uttered;
    and then all this thou seest is but a clod
    and module of confounded royalty.
  bastard. the dauphin is preparing hitherward,
    where god he knows how we shall answer him;
    for in a night the best part of my pow'r,
    as i upon advantage did remove,
    were in the washes all unwarily
    devoured by the unexpected flood.                 [the king

  salisbury. you breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.
    my liege! my lord! but now a king-now thus.
  prince henry. even so must i run on, and even so stop.
    what surety of the world, what hope, what stay,
    when this was now a king, and now is clay?
  bastard. art thou gone so? i do but stay behind
    to do the office for thee of revenge,
    and then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,
    as it on earth hath been thy servant still.
    now, now, you stars that move in your right

 spheres,
    where be your pow'rs? show now your mended faiths,
    and instantly return with me again
    to push destruction and perpetual shame
    out of the weak door of our fainting land.
    straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;
    the dauphin rages at our very heels.
  salisbury. it seems you know not, then, so much as we:
    the cardinal pandulph is within at rest,
    who half an hour since came from the dauphin,
    and brings from him such offers of our peace
    as we with honour and respect may take,
    with purpose presently to leave this war.
  bastard. he will the rather do it when he sees
    ourselves well sinewed to our defence.
  salisbury. nay, 'tis in a manner done already;
    for many carriages he hath dispatch'd
    to the sea-side, and pu

business happily.
  bastard. let it be so. and you, my noble prince,
    with other princes that may best be spar'd,
    shall wait upon your father's funeral.
  prince henry. at worcester must his body be interr'd;
    for so he will'd it.
  bastard. thither shall it, then;
    and happily may your sweet self put on
    the lineal state and glory of the land!
    to whom, with all submission, on my knee
    i do bequeath my faithful services
    and true subjection everlastingly.
  salisbury. and the like tender of our love we make,
    to rest without a spot for evermore.
  prince henry. i have a kind soul that would give you thanks,
    and knows not how to do it but with tears.
  bastard. o, let us pay the time but needful woe,
    since it hath been beforehand with our griefs.
    this england never did, nor never shall,
    lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,
    but when it first did help to wound itself.
    now these her princes are come home again,
