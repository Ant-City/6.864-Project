report back to haymitch that i tried to make  friends, these two might be a  bearable choice. 
both  are  small  in  stature  with  ashen  skin  and  black  hair.  the  woman,  wiress,  is  probably 
around my mother's age and speaks in a quiet, intelligent voice. but right away i notice she 
has  a  habit  of  dropping  off  her  words  in  mid-sentence,  as  if  she's  forgotten  you're  there. 
beetee, the  man,  is  older  and  somewhat  fidgety.  he  wears  glasses  but  spends  a  lot of  time 
looking under them. they're a little strange, but i'm pretty sure neither of them is going to try 
to make me uncomfortable by stripping naked. and they're from district 3. maybe they can 
even confirm my suspicions of an uprising there. 

i  glance  around  the  training  center.  peeta  is  at  the  center  of  a  ribald  circle  of  knife 
throwers. the morphlings from district 6 are in the camo

stay put. 

wiress and beetee  make decent company. they  seem  friendly enough  but don't pry. we 
talk about our talents; they tell me they both invent things, which makes my supposed interest 
in fashion seem pretty weak. wiress brings up some sort of stitching device she's working on. 

â€œit senses the density of the  fabric and selects the strength,â€ she  says, and then  becomes 

absorbed in a bit of dry straw before she can go on.

enough to be concealed in a flake of glitter but can hold hours of songs. i remember octavia 
talking  about  this  during  the  wedding  shoot,  and  i  see  a  possible  chance  to  allude  to  the 
uprising. 

â€œoh,  yeah. my prep team was all upset a few  months ago, i think, because they  couldn't 
get  hold  of  that,â€  i  say  casually.  â€œi  guess  a  lot  of  orders  from  district  three  were  getting 
backed up.â€ 

beetee  examines  me  under  his  glasses.  â€œyes.  did  you  have  any  similar  backups  in  coal 

production, this year?â€ he asks. 

â€œno. well, we lost a couple of weeks when they brought in a new head peacekeeper and 
his crew, but nothing major,â€ i say. â€œto production, i mean. two weeks sitting around your 
house doing nothing just means two weeks of being hungry for most people.â€ 

i think they understand what i'm trying to say. that we've had no uprising. â€œoh. that's a 
shame,â€

i  feel  bad,  knowing  that their  district  must  have  suffered  much  worse  than  ours.  i  feel  i

â€œlook,â€ she says, giving her head a slight nod in their direction. i look up and see plutarch 
heavensbee in the magnificent purple robe with the fur-trimmed collar that designates him as 
head gamemaker. he's eating a turkey leg. 

i  don't  see  why  this  merits  comment,  but  i  say,  â€œyes,  he's  been  promoted  to  head 

gamemaker this year.â€ 

â€œno, no. there by the corner of the table. you can just ...â€ says wiress. 

beetee squints under his glasses. â€œjust make it out.â€ 

i  stare  in  that  direction,  perplexed.  but  then  i  see  it.  a  patch  of  space  about  six  inches 
square at the corner of the table seems almost to be  vibrating. it's as  if the air  is rippling  in 
tiny visible waves, distorting the sharp edges of the wood and a goblet of wine someone has 
set there.

â€œme, probably,â€ i confess. â€œlast year i shot an arrow at them during my private training 
session.â€  beetee  and  wiress  look  at  me  curiously.  â€œi  was  provoked.  so,  do  all  force  fields 
have a spot like that?â€ 

â€œchink,â€ says wiress vaguely. 

â€œin the armor, as it were,â€ finishes beetee. â€œideally it'd be invisible, wouldn't it?â€ 

i want to ask them more, but lunch is announced. i look for peeta, but he's hanging with a 
group of about ten other victors, so i decide just to eat with district 3. maybe i can get seeder 
to join us. 

when we make our way into the dining area, i see some of peeta's gang have other ideas. 
they're  dragging  all  the  smaller  tables  to  form  one  large  table  so  that  we  all  have  to  eat 
together. now i don't know what to do. even at

i  take  a  tray  and  start  making  my  way  around  the  food-laden  carts  that  ring  the  room. 

peeta catches up with me at the stew. â€œhow's it going?â€ 

â€œgood. fine. i like the district three victors,â€ i say. â€œwiress and beetee.â€ 

â€œreally?â€ he asks. â€œthey're something of a joke to the others.â€ 

â€œwhy  does that not surprise  me?â€ i say. i think  of  how peeta was always  surrounded at 
school by a crowd of friends. it's amazing, really, that he ever took any notice of me except to 
think i was odd. 

â€œjohanna's nicknamed them nuts and volts,â€ he says. â€œi think she's nuts and he's volts.â€ 

â€œand  so  i'm  stupid  for  thinking  they  might  be  useful.  because  of  something  johanna

â€œactually i think the nickname's been around for years. and i didn't mean that as an insult.

â€œwell,  wiress  and  beetee  are  smart.  they  invent  things.  they  could  tell  by  sight  that  a 
force field had been put up between us and the gamemakers. and if we have to have allies, i 
want them.â€ i toss the ladle back in a pot of stew, splattering us both with the gravy. 

â€œwhat are you so angry about?â€ peeta asks, wiping the gravy from his shirtfront. â€œbecause

â€œkatniss has remarkably good judgment,â€ says finnick. with one hand he reaches into the 
water and scoops out mags like she weighs no more than a puppy. she makes some remark 
that i think includes the word â€œbob,â€ then pats her belt. 

â€œlook, she's right. someone figured it out.â€ finnick points to beetee. he's flailing around

but there is no other side. i know this before anyone else, even though i am farthest from

it's  fixed  in  space,  not  shifting  when  i  move.  and  that's  when  i  connect  the  square  with 
wiress and beetee in the training center and realize what lies before us. my warning cry is 
just reaching my lips when peeta's knife swings out to slash away some vines. 

there's a sharp zapping sound. for an instant, the trees are gone and i see open space over 
a short stretch of  bare earth. then peeta's  flung  back  from the  force  field, bringing  finnick 
and mags to the ground. 

i rush over to where he lies, motionless in a web of vines. â€œpeeta?â€ there's a faint smell of

peeta starts to object but finnick cuts him off. â€œno, let her do it.â€ he frowns at me. â€œyou 
knew  that  force  field  was  there,  didn't  you?  right  at  the  last  second?  you  started to  give  a

i  hesitate.  to  reveal  that  i  know  beetee  and  wiress's  trick  of  recognizing  a  force  field 
could  be  dangerous.  i  don't  know  if  the  gamemakers  made  note  of  that  moment  during 
training  when  the  two  pointed  it  out  to  me  or  not.  one  way  or  the  other,  i  have  a  very

the sky brightens when the seal of the capitol appears as if floating in space. as i listen to 
the strains of the anthem i think, it will be harder for finnick and mags. but it turns out to be 
plenty hard for me as well. seeing the faces of the eight dead victors projected into the sky. 

the  man  from district 5, the one finnick took out with his trident, is the  first to  appear. 
that  means  that  all  the  tributes  in  1  through  4  are  alive  â€”  the  four  careers,  beetee  and 
wiress, and, of course, mags and finnick. the man from district 5 is followed by the male 
morphling  from 6, cecelia and  woof  from 8, both  from 9, the woman  from 10, and seeder 
from 11. the capitol seal is back with a final bit of music and then the sky goes dark except 
for the moon.

kids hanging on to cecelia when they took her away. seeder's kindness to me at our meeting.

to make it divulge its purpose to me. finally, in frustration, i jam one end into the dirt. â€œi give

i exchange a look with peeta. â€œwhat now?â€ i ask. 

â€œwe can't really leave finnick,â€ he says. 

â€œguess  not.  come  on,  then,â€  i  say  grouchily,  because  even  if  i'd  had  a  list  of  allies, 
johanna mason would definitely not have been on it. the two of us tromp down the beach to 
where finnick and johanna are just meeting up. as we move in closer, i see her companions, 
and confusion sets in. that's beetee on the ground on his back and wiress who's regained her 
feet to continue making loops. â€œshe's got wiress and beetee.â€ 

â€œnuts and volts?â€ says peeta, equally puzzled. â€œi've got to hear how this happened.â€ 

when  we  reach  them,  johanna's  gesturing  toward  the  jungle  and  talking  very  fast  to 
finnick.  â€œwe  thought  it  was  rain,  you  know,  because  of  the  lightning,  and  we  were  all  so

â€œi'm  sorry,  johanna,â€  says  finnick.  it  takes  a  moment  to  place  blight.  i  think  he  was 
johanna's male counterpart from district 7, but i hardly remember seeing him. come to think 
of it, i don't even think he showed up for training. 

â€œyeah,  well,  he  wasn't  much,  but  he  was  from  home,â€  she  says.  â€œand  he  left  me  alone 
with these two.â€ she nudges beetee, who's barely conscious, with her shoe. â€œhe got a knife

we all look over at wiress, who's circling around, coated in dried blood, and murmuring, 

â€œtick, tock. tick, tock.â€ 

â€œyeah, we know. tick, tock. nuts is in shock,â€ says johanna. this seems to draw wiress 
in her direction and she careens into johanna, who harshly shoves her to the beach. â€œjust stay

â€œlay off her,â€ i snap. 

johanna  narrows  her  brown

said, about getting them for me. 

â€œwhat did she mean? she got them for me?â€ i ask peeta. 

â€œi don't know. you did want them originally,â€ he reminds me. 

â€œyeah,  i  did.  originally.â€  but  that  answers  nothing.  i  look  down  at  beetee's  inert  body. 

â€œbut i won't have them long unless we do something.â€ 

peeta lifts beetee up in his arms and i take wiress by the hand and we go back to our little 
beach camp. i sit wiress in the shallows so she can get washed up a bit, but she just clutches 
her hands together and occasionally mumbles, â€œtick, tock.â€ i unhook beetee's belt and find a 
heavy metal cylinder attached to the side with a rope of vines. i can't tell what it is,  but if he

saturated with blood as well. there's no choice but to strip him naked to get him clean, but i 
have  to  say  this  doesn't  make  much  of  an  impression  on  me  anymore.  our  kitchen  table's 
been full of so many naked men this year. you kind of get used to it after a while.

nearby trees and carry  it  back to the beach. i  make a thick pad out of the  moss, place  it on

then pull him into the shade at the edge of the jungle.

â€œtick, tock.â€ she does seem to be trying to tell me something, but with no beetee to explain 
her thoughts, i'm at a loss. 

â€œyes, tick, tock. tick, tock,â€ i say. this seems to calm  her down a  little. i wash out her 
jumpsuit until there's hardly a trace of blood, and help her back into it. it's not damaged like 
ours were. her belt's fine, so i fasten that on, too. then i pin her undergarments, along with 
beetee's, under some rocks and let them soak.

came the blood rain, where johanna, wiress, and beetee were caught. we would have been 
in the third section, right next to that, when the fog appeared. and as soon as it was sucked 
away, the monkeys began to gather in the fourth. tick, tock. my head snaps to the other side. 
a couple of hours ago, at around ten, that wave came out of the second section to the left of 
where the lightning strikes now. at noon. at midnight. at noon.

tick-tocking  and  how  the  movements  of  the  invisible  hands  trigger  a  deadly  force  in  each 
section. 

i think i've convinced everyone who's conscious except johanna, who's naturally opposed 

to liking anything i suggest. but even she agrees it's better to be safe than sorry. 

while the others collect our few possessions and get beetee back into his jumpsuit, i rouse 

wiress. she awakes with a panicked â€œtick, tock!â€ 

â€œyes, tick, tock, the arena's a clock. it's a clock, wiress, you were right,â€ i say. â€œyou were

relief  floods  her  face  â€”  i  guess  because  somebody  has  finally  understood  what  she's 

known probably from the first tolling of the bells. â€œmidnight.â€

finnick gives her the last bit of bread and she gnaws on it. with the inability to communicate 
overcome, she's functioning again. 

i check my weapons. tie up the spile and the tube of medicine in the parachute and fix it 

to my belt with vine. 

beetee's still pretty out of it, but when peeta tries to lift him, he objects. â€œwire,â€ he says.

but still beetee struggles. â€œwire,â€ he insists.

â€œhe  won  his  games  with  wire.  setting  up  that  electrical  trap,â€  says  peeta.  â€œit's  the  best 

weapon he could have.â€ 

there's  something  odd  about  johanna  not  putting  this  together.  something  that  doesn't 
quite  ring  true.  suspicious.  â€œseems  like  you'd  have  figured  that  out,â€  i  say.  â€œsince  you 
nicknamed him volts and all.â€ 

johanna's eyes narrow at me dangerously. â€œyeah, that was really stupid of me, wasn't it?â€

e friends alive. while you 
were...what, again? getting mags killed off?â€ 

my fingers tighten on the knife handle at my belt. 

â€œgo  ahead.  try  it.  i  don't  care  if  you  are  knocked  up,  i'll  rip  your  throat  out,â€  says 

johanna. 

i know i can't kill her right now. but it's just a matter of time with johanna and me. before 

one of us offs the other. 

â€œmaybe we all had better be careful where we step,â€ says finnick, shooting me a look. he 
takes the coil and sets it on beetee's chest. â€œthere's your wire, volts. watch where you plug 
it.â€ 

peeta picks up the now-unresisting beetee. â€œwhere to?â€ 

â€œi'd like to go to the cornucopia and watch. just to make sure we're right about the clock,â€ 
says  finnick. it seems as good a plan as any. besides, i wouldn't  mind the chance of going 
over the weapons again. and there are six of us now. even if you count beetee and wiress 
out,  we've  got  four  good  fighters.  it's  so  different  from  where  i  was  last

doing  everything  on  my  own.  yes,  it's  great  to  have  allies  as  long  as  you  can  ignore  the 
thought that you'll have to kill them. 

beetee  and  wiress  will  probably  find  some  way  to  die  on  their  own.  if  we  have  to  run 
from something, how far would they get? johanna, frankly, i could easily kill if it came down 
to protecting peeta. or maybe even just to shut her up. what i really need is for someone to 
take out finnick for me, since i don't think i can do it personally. not after all he's done for 
peeta. i think about maneuvering him into some kind of encounter with the careers. it's cold, 
i know. but what are

president  snow.  not  very  pretty  daydreams  for  a  seventeen-year-old  girl,  i  guess,  but  very 
satisfying. 

we walk down the nearest sand strip, approaching the cornucopia with care, just in case 
the careers are concealed there. i doubt they are, because we've been on the beach for hours 
and  there's  been  no  sign  of  life.  the  area's  abandoned,  as  i  expected.  only  the  big  golden 
horn and the picked-over pile of weapons remain. 

when  peeta  lays  beetee  in  the  bit  of  shade  the  cornucopia  provides,  he  calls  out  to 
wiress.  she  crouches  beside  him  and  he  puts  the  coil  of  wire  in  her  hands.  â€œclean  it,  will 
you?â€ he asks. 

wiress nods and scampers over to the water's edge, where she dunks the coil in the water. 
she starts quietly singing some funny little song, about a mouse running up a clock. it must 
be for children, but it seems to make her happy. 

â€œoh, not the song again,â€ says johanna, rolling her eye

she started tick-tocking.â€ 

suddenly wiress stands up very straight and points to the jungle. â€œtwo,â€ she says. 

i  follow  her  finger  to  where  the  wall  of  fog  has  just  begun  to  seep  out  onto  the  beach. 

â€œyes, look, wiress is right. it's two o'clock and the fog has started.â€ 

â€œlike clockwork,â€ says peeta. â€œyou were very smart to figure that out, wiress.â€ 

wiress smiles and goes back to singing and dunking her coil. â€œoh, she's more than smart,â€ 
says beetee. â€œshe's intuitive.â€ we all turn to look at beetee, who seems to be coming back to 
life. â€œshe can sense things before anyone else. like a canary in one of your coal mines.â€ 

â€œwhat's that?â€ finnick asks me. 

â€œit's a bird that we take down into the mines to warn us if there's bad air,â€ i say. 

â€œwhat's it do, die?â€ asks johanna. 

â€œit stops singing first. that's when you should get out. but if the air's too bad, it dies, yes. 
and so do  you.â€ i don't want to talk about

despite her annoyance at wiress, johanna's as happy as i've seen her in the arena. while 
i'm adding to my stock of arrows, she pokes around until she comes up with a pair of lethal-
looking axes. it seems an odd choice until i see her throw one with such force it sticks in the 
sun-softened  gold  of  the  cornucopia.  of  course.  johanna  mason.  district  7.  lumber.  i  bet 
she's  been  tossing  around  axes  since  she  could  toddle.  it's  like  finnick  with  his  trident.  or 
beetee  with  his  wire.  rue  with  her  knowledge  of  plants.  i  realize  it's  just  another 
disadvantage  the  district  12  tributes  have  faced  over  the  years.  we  don't  go  down  in  the 
mines until we're eighteen. it looks like most of the other tributes learn something about their 
trades early on. there are things  you do in  a  mine that could come  in  handy  in the  games.

writes lightning in tiny print in the corresponding wedge, then works clockwise adding blood, 
fog, and monkeys in the following sections. 

â€œand  ten  to  eleven  is  the  wave,â€  i  say.  he  adds  it.  finnick  and  johanna  join  us  at  this 

point, armed to the teeth with tridents, axes, and knives. 

â€œdid  you  notice  anything  unusual  in  the  others?â€  i  ask  johanna  and  beetee,  since  they 
might  have  seen  something  we  didn't.  but  all  they've  seen  is  a  lot  of  blood.  â€œi  guess  they 
could hold anything.â€ 

â€œi'm going to mark the ones where we know the gamemakers' weapon follows us out past 
the  jungle,  so  we'll  stay  clear  of  those,â€  says  peeta,  drawing  diagonal  lines  on  the  fog  and 
wave beaches. then he sits back. â€œwell, it's a lot more than we knew this morning, anyway.â€ 

we all nod in agreement, and that's when i  notic

 staring  into 
that  relentless  sun.  as  i  tread  water,  i  have  to  wrench  the  coil  of  wire  from  her  fingers, 
because  her  final  grip  on  it  is  so  tight. there's  nothing  i  can  do then  but  close  her  eyelids, 
whisper  good-bye,  and  swim  away.  by  the  time  i  swing  the  coil  up  onto the  sand  and  pull 
myself from the water, her body's gone. but i can still taste her blood mingled with the sea 
salt. 

i  walk  back  to  the  cornucopia.  finnick's  gotten  beetee  back  alive,  although  a  little 
waterlogged,  sitting  up  and  snorting  out  water.  he  had  the  good  sense  to  hang  on  to  his 
glasses, so at least he can see. i place the reel of wire on his lap. it's sparkling clean, no blood 
left at all. he unravels a piece of the wire and runs it through his fingers. for the first time i 
see  it, and  it's unlike any wire i know. a pale golden color and as  fine as a piece of  hair. i 
wonder how long it is. there must be miles of the stuff

because i know he's thinking of wiress. 

i  look  at  the  others'  sober  faces.  now  finnick,  johanna,  and  beetee  have  all  lost  their 
district partners. i cross to peeta and wrap my arms around him, and for a while we all stay 
silent. 

â€œlet's  get  off  this  stinking  island,â€  johanna  says  finally.  there's  only  the  matter  of  our 
weapons  now,  which  we've  largely  retained.  fortunately  the  vines  here  are  strong  and  the 
spile  and  tube  of  medicine  wrapped  in  the  parachute  are  still  secured  to  my  belt.  finnick

head to the beach at twelve o'clock. that should provide hours of calm and keep us clear of 
any  poisonous  residue.  and  then  peeta,  johanna,  and  finnick  head  off  in  three  different 
directions. 

â€œtwelve o'clock, right?â€ says peeta. â€œthe tail points at twelve.â€ 

â€œbefore they spun us,â€ says finnick. â€œi was judging by the sun.â€ 

â€œthe sun only tells you it's going on four, finnick,â€ i

 say. 

â€œi  think  katniss's  point  is,  knowing  the  time  doesn't  mean  you  necessarily  know  where 
four is on the clock. you might have a general idea of the direction. unless you consider that 
they may have shifted the outer ring of jungle as well,â€ says beetee. 

no, katniss's point was a lot more basic than that. beetee's articulated a theory far beyond 
my comment on the sun. but i just nod my  head  like i've been on the same page all along. 
â€œyes, so any one of these paths could lead to twelve o'clock,â€ i say. 

we  circle  around  the  cornucopia,  scrutinizing  the  jungle.  it  has  a  baffling  uniformity.  i 
remember the tall tree that took the  first  lightning strike at twelve o'clock,  but every  sector 
has a similar tree. johanna thinks to follow enobaria's and brutus's tracks, but they have

been 
blown  or  washed  away.  there's  no  way  to  tell  where  anything  is.  â€œi  should  have  never 
mentioned the clock,â€ i say bitterly. â€œnow they've taken that advantage away as well.â€ 

â€œonly temporarily,â€ says beetee. â€œat ten, we'll see the wave again and be back on track.â€ 

â€œyes, they can't redesign the whole arena,â€ says peeta. 

â€œit doesn't matter,â€ says johanna impatiently. â€œyou had to tell us or we never would have 
moved our camp  in the  first place,  brainless.â€ ironically,  her  logical,  if  demeaning, reply  is 

the only one that comforts me. yes, i had to tell them to get them to move. â€œcome on, i need

tree line and i'm filled with a mixture of 
relief and anger.  why didn't peeta come to help  me?  why did  no one come after us? even 
now he hangs back, his hands raised, palms toward us, lips moving but no words reaching us. 
why?, 

the wall is so transparent, finnick and i run smack into it and bounce back onto the jungle 
floor. i'm lucky. my shoulder took the worst of the impact, whereas finnick hit face-first and 
now his  nose  is gushing  blood. this  is why peeta and johanna and even beetee, who i see 
sadly shaking his head behind them, have not come to our aid. an invisible barrier blocks the 
area in front of us. it's not a force field. you can touch the hard, smooth surface all you like. 
but  peeta's  knife  and  johanna's  ax  can't  make  a  dent  in  it.  i  know,  without  checking  more 
than a few feet to one side, that it encloses the entire four-to-five-o'clock wedge. that we will 
be trapped like rats until the hour passes. 

peeta presses his hand against the surfac

katniss. a horrible one. but we're the only ones who can be hurt by it. we're the ones in the 
games. not them.â€ 

â€œyou really believe that?â€ i say. 

â€œi  really  do,â€  says  peeta.  i  waver,  thinking  of  how  peeta  can  make  anyone  believe 

anything. i look over at finnick for confirmation, see he's fixated on peeta, his words. 

â€œdo you believe it, finnick?â€ i ask. 

â€œit  could  be  true.  i  don't  know,â€  he  says.  â€œcould  they  do  that,  beetee?  take  someone's 

regular voice and make it ...â€ 

â€œoh,  yes.  it's  not  even  that  difficult,  finnick.  our  children  learn  a  similar  technique  in 

school,â€ says beetee. 

â€œof  course  peeta's  right.  the  whole  country  adores  katniss's  little  sister.  if  they  really 
killed  her  like  this,  they'd  probably  have  an  uprising  on  their  hands,â€  says  johanna  flat ly.

remember the birds must be gone, but i still don't want anyone in there. not even her. 

â€œthey can't hurt me. i'm not like the rest of you. there's no one left i love,â€ johanna says, 
and frees her hand with an impatient shake. when she brings me back a shell of water, i take 
it with a silent nod of thanks, knowing how much she would despise the pity in my voice. 

while  johanna  collects  water  and  my  arrows,  beetee  fiddles  with  his  wire,  and  finnick 

takes to the water. i need to clean up, too, but i stay in peeta's arms, still too shaken to move. 

â€œwho did they use against finnick?â€ he asks. 

â€œsomebody named annie,â€ i say. 

â€œmust be annie cresta,â€ he says. 

â€œwho?â€ i ask. 

â€œannie  cresta.  she  was  the  girl  mags  volunteered  for.  she  won  about  five  years  ago,â€ 

says peeta.

must be some kind of record. 

â€œthey're  really  burning  through  us,â€  says  johanna.  â€œwho's  left?  besides  us  five  and 

district two?â€ asks finnick. 

â€œchaff,â€ says peeta, without needing to think about it. perhaps  he's been keeping an eye 

out for him because of haymitch. 

a  parachute  comes  down  with  a  pile  of  bite-sized  square-shaped  rolls.  â€œthese  are  from 

your district, right, beetee?â€ peeta asks. 

â€œyes, from district three,â€ he says. â€œhow many are there?â€ 

finnick  counts  them,  turning  each  one  over  in  his  hands  before  he  sets  it  in  a  neat 
configuration.  i  don't  know  what  it  is  with  finnick  and  bread,  but  he  seems  obsessed  with 
handling it. â€œtwenty-four,â€ he says. 

â€œan even two dozen, then?â€ says beetee. 

â€œtwenty-four on the nose,â€ says finnick. â€œhow should we divide them?â€ 

â€œlet's each have three, and whoeve

be tricky, because once they realize we're severing the alliance, we'll be instant targets. 

if  i  was  really  teaching  him  to  swim,  i'd  make  him  take  off  the  belt  since  it  keeps  him 
afloat, but what does it matter now? so i just show him the basic stroke and let him practice 
going back and forth in waist-high water. at first, i notice johanna keeping a careful eye on 
us, but eventually she loses interest and goes to take a nap. finnick's weaving a new net out 
of vines and beetee plays with his wire. i know the time has come. 

while  peeta  has  been  swimming,  i've  discovered  something.  my  remaining  scabs  are 
starting to peel off. by gently rubbing a handful of sand up and down my arm, i clean off the 
rest of the scales, revealing fresh new skin underneath. 

i stop peeta's practice, on the pretext of showing him how to rid himself of the itchy scabs, 

and as we scrub ourselves, i bring up our escape. 

â€œlook, the  pool  is  down  to  eight.  i  think  it'

although i doubt any of the tributes can hear me. 

peeta nods, and i can see him considering my proposition. weighing if the odds will be in 
our favor. â€œtell you what,â€ he says. â€œlet's stick around until brutus and enobaria are dead. i 
think beetee's trying to put together some kind of trap for them now. then, i promise, we'll 
go.â€ 

i'm not entirely convinced. but if we leave now, we'll have two sets of adversaries after us. 
maybe  three,  because  who  knows  what  chaff's  up to?  plus  the  clock  to  contend  with.  and 
then there's beetee to think of. johanna only brought him for me, and if we leave she'll surely 
kill him. then i remember. i can't protect beetee, too. there can only be one victor and it has 
to be peeta. i mu

the careers are dead. but that's the end of it.â€ i turn and 

wave to finnick. â€œhey, finnick, come on in! we figured out how to make you pretty again!â€ 

the  three  of  us  scour  all  the  scabs  from  our  bodies,  helping  with  the  others'  backs,  and 
come  out  the  same  pink  as  the  sky.  we  apply  another  round  of  medicine  because  the  skin 
seems too delicate for the sunlight, but it doesn't look half as bad on smooth skin and will be 
good camouflage in the jungle. 

beetee calls us over, and it turns out that during all those hours of fiddling with wire, he 
has  indeed  come  up  with  a  plan.  â€œi  think  we'll  all  agree  our  next  job  is  to  kill  brutus  and 
enobaria,â€  he  says  mildly.  â€œi  doubt  they'll  attack  us  openly  again,  now  that  they're  so 
outnumbered. we could track them down, i suppose, but it's dangerous, exhausting work.â€ 

â€œdo you think they've figured out about the clock?â€ i ask. 

â€œif they haven't, they'll figure
 
 ___________________________
 
 it out soon enough. perhaps not as specifically as we have. 
but  they  must  know  that  at  least  some  of  the  zones  are  wired  for  attacks  and  that  they're 
reoccurring in a circular fashion. also, the fact that our last fight was cut off by gamemaker 
intervention will  not have gone unnoticed by them.  we know  it was an attempt to disorient 
us, but they must be asking themselves why it was done, and this, too, may lead them to the 
realization that the arena's a clock,â€ says beetee. â€œso i think our best bet will be setting our 
own trap.â€ 

â€œwait,  let  me  get  johanna  up,â€  says  finnick.  â€œshe'll  be  rabid  if  she  thinks  she  missed 

something this important.â€ 

â€œor not,â€ i mutter, since she's always pretty much rabid, but i don't stop him, because i'd 

be angry myself if i was excluded from a plan at this point. 

when she's joined us, beetee shoos us all back a bit so he can have room to work in the 
sand. he swiftly draws a circle and divides 
 
 ___________________________
 
it into twelve wedges. it's the arena, not rendered 
in-peeta's precise strokes but in the rough lines of a man whose mind is occupied by other, far 
more complex things. â€œif you were brutus and enobaria, knowing what you do now about the 
jungle, where would you feel safest?â€ beetee asks. there's nothing patronizing  in his voice, 
and yet i can't help thinking he reminds me of a schoolteacher about to ease children into a 
lesson. perhaps it's the age difference, or simply that beetee is probably about a million times 
smarter than the rest of us. 

â€œwhere we are now. on the beach,â€ says peeta. â€œit's the safest place.â€ 

â€œso why aren't they on the beach?â€ says beetee. 

â€œbecause we're here,â€ says johanna impatiently. 

â€œexactly. we're here, claiming the beach. now where would you go?â€ says beetee. 

i think about the deadly jungle, the occupied beach. â€œi'd hide just at the edge of the jungle. 

so i could escape if an attack came. and so i could spy on

us.â€ 

â€œalso  to  eat,â€  finnick  says.  â€œthe  jungle's  full  of  strange  creatures  and  plants.  but  by 

watching us, i'd know the seafood's safe.â€ 

beetee smiles at us as if we've exceeded his expectations.  â€œyes, good. you do see. now 
here's  what  i  propose:  a  twelve  o'clock  strike.  what  happens  exactly  at  noon  and  at 
midnight?â€ 

â€œthe lightning bolt hits the tree,â€ i say. 

â€œyes.  so  what  i'm  suggesting  is  that  after  the  bolt  hits  at  noon,  but  before  it  hits  at 
midnight,  we  run  my  wire  from  that  tree  all  the  way  down  into  the  saltwater,  which  is,  of 
course, highly conductive. when the 
 
 ___________________________
 
bolt strikes, the electricity will travel down the wire and 
into not only the water but also the surrounding beach, which will still be damp from the ten 
o'clock  wave.  anyone  in  contact  with  those  surfaces  at  that  moment  will  be  electrocuted,â€ 
says beetee. 

there's  a  long  pause  while  we  all  digest  beetee's  plan.  it  seems  a  bit  fantastical  to  me, 
impossible  even.  but  why?  i've  set thousands  of  snares.  isn't  this  just  a  larger  snare  with  a 
more scientific component? could it work? how can we even question it, we tributes trained 
to gather fish and lumber and coal? what do we know about harnessing power from the sky? 

peeta takes a stab at it. â€œwill that wire really be able to conduct that much power, beetee? 

it looks so fragile, like it would just burn up.â€ 

â€œo

h,  it  will.  but  not  until  the  current  has  passed  through  it.  it  will  act  something  like  a 

fuse, in fact. except the electricity will travel along it,â€ says beetee. 

â€œhow do you know?â€ asks johanna, clearly not convinced. 

â€œbecause i invented it,â€ says beetee, as if slightly surprised. â€œit's not actually wire in the 
usual  sense.  nor  is  the  lightning  natural  lightning  nor  the  tree  a  real  tree.  you  know  trees 
better than any of us, johanna. it would be destroyed by now, wouldn't it?â€ 

â€œyes,â€ she says glumly. 

â€œdon't worry about the wire â€” it will do just what i say,â€ beetee assures us. 

â€œand where will we be when this happens?â€ asks finnick. 

â€œfar enough up in the jungle to be safe,â€ beetee replies. 

â€œthe

 careers will be safe, too, then, unless they're in the vicinity of the water,â€ i point out. 

â€œthat's right,â€ says beetee. 

â€œbut all the seafood will be cooked,â€ says peeta. 

â€œprobably more than cooked,â€ says beetee. â€œwe will most likely be eliminating that as a 

food source for good. but you found other edible things in the jungle, right, katniss?â€ 

â€œyes. nuts and rats,â€ i say. â€œand we have sponsors.â€ 

â€œwell, then. i don't see that as a problem,â€ says beetee. â€œbut as we are allies and this will 

require all our efforts, the decision of whether or not to attempt it is up to you four.â€ 

we are like schoolchildren. completely unable to dispute his theory with anything but the 
most elementary concerns. most of which don't even have anything to do with his actual plan. 
i look at the others' disconcerted faces. â€œwhy not?â€ i say. â€œif it fails, there's no harm done. if 
it  works,  there's  a  decent  chance  we'll  kill  them.  and  even  if
 
 ___________________________
 
  we  don't  and  just  kill  the 
seafood, brutus and enobaria lose it as a food source, too.â€ 

â€œi say we try it,â€ says peeta. â€œkatniss is right.â€ 

finnick  looks  at  johanna  and  raises  his  eyebrows.  he  will  not  go  forward  without  her. 
â€œall right,â€ she says finally. â€œit's better than hunting them down in the jungle, anyway. and i 
doubt they'll figure out our plan, since we can barely understand it ourselves.â€ 

beetee wants to inspect the  lightning tree before he  has to rig  it. judging  by the sun,  it's 
about  nine  in  the  morning.  we  have  to  leave  our  beach  soon,  anyway.  so  we  break  camp, 
walk over to the beach that borders the  lightning  section, and  head  into the  jungle. beetee's 
still too weak to hike up the slope on his own, so finnick and peeta take turns carrying him. i 
let johanna lead because it's a pretty straight shot up to the tree, and i figure she can't get us

i've had the fish, i'm craving salt. a piece of ice would be another good idea. or a cold drink 
of water. i'm grateful for the fluid from the trees, but it's the same temperature as the seawater 
and the air and the other tributes and me. we're all just one big, warm stew. 

as we near the tree, finnick suggests i take the lead. â€œkatniss can hear the force field,â€ he 

explains to beetee and johanna. 

â€œhear it?â€ asks beetee. 

â€œonly with the ear the capitol reconstructed,â€ i say. guess who i'm not fooling with that 
story? beetee. because surely he remembers that he showed me how to spot a force field, and 
probably  it's  impossible  to  hear  force  fields,  anyway.  but,  for  whatever  reason,  he  doesn't 
question my claim. 

â€œthen by all means, let katniss go first,â€ he says, pausing a moment to wipe the steam off 

his glasses. â€œforce fields are nothing t

nd  make everybody wait  while i  move slowly up the  slope, tossing the  nuts ahead of 
me. but i see the force field almost immediately, even before a nut hits it, because it's only 
about fifteen yards away. my eyes, which are sweeping the greenery before me, catch sight of 
the rippled square high up and to my right. i throw a nut directly  in front of me and hear it 
sizzle in confirmation. 

â€œjust stay below the lightning tree,â€ i tell the others. 

we divide up duties. finnick guards beetee while he examines the tree, johanna taps for 
water,  peeta  gathers  nuts,  and  i  hunt  nearby.  the  tree  rats  don't  seem  to  have  any  fear  of 
humans, so i take down three easily. the sound of the ten o'clock wave reminds me i should 
get back, and i return to the others and clean my kill. then i draw a line  in the dirt a few feet 
from the force field as a reminder to keep back, and peeta and i settle down to roast nuts and 
sear cubes of rat. 

beetee is still messing around the

tree, doing i don't know what, taking measurements and 
such. at one point he snaps off a sliver of bark, joins us, and throws it against the force field. 
it bounces back and lands on the ground, glowing. in a few moments it returns to its original 
color. â€œwell, that explains a lot,â€ says beetee. i look at peeta and can't help biting my lip to 
keep from laughing since it explains absolutely nothing to anyone but beetee. 

about  this  time  we  hear  the  sound  of  clicks  rising  from  the  sector  adjacent  to  us.  that 
means it's eleven o'clock. it's far louder in the jungle than it was on the beach last night. we 
all listen intently. 

â€œit's not mechanical,â€ beetee says decidedly. 

â€œi'd guess insects,â€ i say. â€œmaybe beetles.â€ 

â€œsomething with pincers,â€ adds finnick. 

the sound swells, as if alerted by our quiet words to the proximity of live flesh. whatever 

is making that clickin

g, i bet it could strip us to the bone in seconds. 

â€œwe should get out of here, anyway,â€ says johanna. â€œthere's less than an hour before the 

lightning starts.â€ 

we don't go that far, though. only to the identical tree in the blood-rain section. we have a 
picnic  of  sorts,  squatting  on  the  ground,  eating  our  jungle  food,  waiting  for  the  bolt  that 
signals  noon. at beetee's request, i climb up  into the canopy as the clicking  begins to fade 
out. when the lightning strikes, it's dazzling, even from here, even in this bright sunlight. it 
completely  encompasses  the  distant  tree,  making  it  glow  a  hot  blue-white  and  causing  the 
surrounding  air  to  crackle  with  electricity.  i  swing  down  and  report  my  findings  to  beetee, 
who seems satisfied, even if i'm not terribly scientific. 

we take a circuitous route back to the ten o'clock beach. t

with  the  wire.  since  it's  his  weapon  and  the  rest  of  us  have  to  defer  to  his  knowledge  so 
entirely, there's the odd feeling of being let out of school early. at first we take turns having 
naps in the shadowy edge of the jungle, but by late afternoon everyone is awake and restless. 
we decide, since this might be our last chance for seafood, to make a sort of feast of it. under 
finnick's  guidance  we  spear  fish  and

surely my mother and prim will know to return it to peeta before they bury my body. 

 

 

 

the anthem begins, but there are no faces in the sky tonight. the audience will be restless, 
thirsting for blood. beetee's trap holds enough promise, though, that the gamemakers haven't 
sent in other attacks. perhaps they are simply curious to see if it will work. 

at what finnick and i judge to be about nine, we leave our shell-strewn camp, cross to the 
twelve  o'clock  beach,  and  begin  to  quietly  hike  up  to  the  lightning  tree  in  the  light  of  the 
moon.  our  full  stomachs  make  us  more  uncomfortable  and  breathless  than  we  were  on  the 
morning's climb. i begin to regret those last do

beetee asks finnick to assist him, and the rest of us stand guard. before he even attaches 
any  wire  to  the  tree,  beetee  unrolls  yards  and  yards  of  the  stuff.  he  has  finnick  secure  it 
tightly around a broken branch and lay it on the ground. then they stand on either side of the 
tree, passing the spool back and forth as they wrap the wire around and around the trunk. at 
first it seems arbitrary, then i see a pattern, like an intricate maze, appearing in the moonlight 
on  beetee's  side.  i  wonder  if  it  makes  any  difference  how  the  wire's  placed,  or  if  this  is 
merely  to  add  to  the

  speculation  of  the  audience.  i  bet  most  of  them  know  as  much  about 
electricity as i do. 

the  work  on  the  trunk's  completed  just  as  we  hear  the  wave  begin.  i've  never  really 
worked out at what point in the ten o'clock hour it erupts. there must be some buildup, then 
the wave itself, then the aftermath of the flooding. but the sky tells me ten-thirty. 

this is when beetee reveals the rest of the plan. since we move most swiftly through the 
trees, he wants johanna and me to take the coil down through the jungle, unwinding the wire 
as  we  go.  we  are  to  lay  it  across  the  twelve  o'clock  beach  and  drop  the  metal  spool,  with 
whatever is left, deep into the water, making sure it sinks. then run for the jungle. if we go 
now, right now, we should make it to safety. 

â€œi want to go with them as a guard,â€ peeta says immediately. after the moment wi

pearl, i know he's less willing than ever to let me out of his sight. 

â€œyou're  too  slow.  besides,  i'll  need  you  on  this  end.  katniss  will  guard,â€  says  beetee. 
â€œthere's no time to debate this. i'm sorry. if the girls are to get out of there alive, they need to 
move now.â€ he hands the coil to johanna. 

i don't like the plan any  more than peeta does. how can i protect him at a distance? but 
beetee's right. with his leg, peeta is too slow to make it down the slope in time. johanna and 
i are the fastest and most sure-footed on the jungle floor. i can't think of any alternative. and 
if i trust anyone here besides peeta, it's beetee. 

â€œit's okay,â€ i tell peeta. â€œwe'll just drop the coil and come straight back up.â€ 

â€œnot  into the  lightning  zone,â€  beetee  reminds  me.  â€œhead  for the  tree  in  the  one-to-two-
o'clock sector. if you find you're running out of time, move

over one more. don't even think 
about going back on the beach, though, until i can assess the damage.â€ 

i take peeta's face in my hands. â€œdon't worry. i'll see you at midnight.â€ i give him a kiss 

and, before he can object any further, i let go and turn to johanna. â€œready?â€ 

â€œwhy  not?â€  says  johanna  with  a  shrug.  she's  clearly  no  happier  about  being  teamed  up 
than i am. but we're all caught up in beetee's trap. â€œyou guard, i'll unwind. we can trade off 
later.â€ 

without further discussion, we  head down the slope. in  fact there's  very  little discussion 
between  us  at  all.  we  move  at  a  pretty  good  clip,  one  manning  the  coil,  the  other  keeping 
watch.  about  halfway  down,  we  hear  the  clicking  beginning  to  rise,  indicating  it's  after 
eleven. 

â€œbetter hurry,â€ johanna says. â€œi want to put  a lot  of distance between  me and that water

this much i know. johanna attacked me. smashed that cylinder into my head. cut my arm, 
probably  doing  irreparable  damage  to  veins  and  arteries,  and  then  brutus  and  enobaria 
showed up before she had time to finish me off. 

the  alliance  is  over.  finnick  and  johanna  must  have  had  an  agreement  to  turn  on  us 
tonight. i knew we should have left this morning. i don't know where beetee stands. but i'm 
fair game, and so is peeta. 

peeta! my  eyes  fly  open  in  panic.  peeta  is  waiting  up  by  the  tree,  unsuspecting  and  off 
guard. maybe finnick has even killed him already. â€œno,â€ i whisper. that wire was cut from a 
short  distance  away  by  the  careers.  finnick  and  beetee  and  peetaâ€”they  can't  know  what's 
going on down here. they can only be wondering what has happened, why the wire has gone 
slack or maybe even  sprung  back to the tree. this,  in

peeta. my dying wish. my promise. to keep him alive. my heart lifts a bit when i realize 
he  must  be  alive  because  no  cannon  has  fired.  maybe  johanna  was  acting  alone,  knowing 
finnick would side with her once her intentions were clear. although it's hard to guess what 
goes  on  between  those  two.  i  think  of  how  he  looked  to  her  for  confirmation  before  he'd 
agree to help  set beetee's trap. there's a  much deeper alliance  based on  years of  friendship 
and who knows what else. therefore, if  johanna  has turned on me, i should no  longer trust 
finnick. 

i reach this conclusion only seconds before i hear someone running down the slope toward 
me.  neither  peeta  nor  beetee  could  move  at  this  pace.  i  duck  behind  a  curtain  of  vines, 
concealing myself just in time. finnick flies by me, his skin shadowy with medicine, leaping 
through  the  undergrowth  like

thing  snags  my  feet  and  i  sprawl  out  on  the  ground.  i  feel  it  wrapping  around  me, 
entwining me in sharp fibers. a net! this must be one of finnick's fancy nets, positioned to 
trap me, and he must be nearby, trident in hand. i flail around for a moment, only working the 

web  more tightly  around  me, and then i catch a glimpse of  it in the  moonlight. confused, i 
lift my arm and see it's entangled in shimmering golden threads. it's not one of finnick's nets 
at  all,  but  beetee's  wire.  i  carefully  rise  to  my  feet  and  find  i'm  in  a  patch  of  the  stuff  that 
caught on a trunk on its way back to the lightning tree. slowly i disengage myself from the 
wire, step out of its reach, and continue uphill. 

on the good side, i'm on the right path and have not been so disoriented by the head injury 
as to lose my sense of direction. on the bad side, the wire has reminded me of the oncoming 
lightning storm. i can still hear the insects, but are they starting to

the  tree  swims  into  view,  its  trunk  festooned  with  gold.  i  slow  down, try  to  move  with 
some stealth, but i'm really just lucky to be upright. i look for a sign of the others. no one. 
no one is there. â€œpeeta?â€ i call softly. â€œpeeta?â€ 

a soft moan answers me and i whip around to find a figure lying higher up on the ground. 
â€œbeetee!â€  i  exclaim.  i  hurry  and  kneel  beside  him.  the  moan  must  have  been  involuntary. 
he's not conscious, although i can see no wound except a gash below the crook of his elbow. 
i  grab  a  nearby  handful  of  moss  and  clumsily  wrap  it  while  i  try  to  rouse  him.  â€œbeetee! 
beetee,  what's  going  on!  who  cut  you?  beetee!â€  i  shake  him  in  the  way  you  should  never 
shake an injured person, but i don't know what else to do. he moans again and briefly raises a

hand to ward me off. 

this is when i notice he's holding a knife, one peeta was carrying earlier, i think, which is 

wrapped loosely in wire. 

perplexed, i stand and lift the wire, confirming it's attached back at the tree. it takes me a 
moment  to  remember  the  second,  much  shorter  strand  that  beetee  wound  around  a  branch 
and  left on the ground before he even  began  his  design on the tree. i'd thought it had some 
electrical significance,  had  been set aside to be used  later. but  it never was,  because there's 
probably a good twenty, twenty-five yards here. 

i squint hard up the hill and realize we're only a few paces from the force field. there's the 
telltale square, high up and to my right, just as it was this morning. what did beetee do? did 
he  actually  try  to  drive  t

nothing? a great deal? fry us all? the force field  must mostly be energy, too, i guess. the 
one in the training center was invisible. this one seems to somehow mirror the jungle. but 
i've  seen  it  falter  when  peeta's  knife  struck  it  and  when  my  arrows  hit.  the  real  world  lies 
right behind it. 

my  ears  are  not  ringing.  it  was  the  insects  after  all.  i  know  that  now  because  they  are 
dying  out  quickly  and  i  hear  nothing  but  the  jungle  sounds.  beetee  is  useless.  i  can't  rouse 
him. i can't save him. i don't know what he was trying to do with the knife and the wire and 
he's  incapable  of  explaining.  the  moss  bandage  on  my  arm  is  soaked  and  there's  no  use 
fooling myself. i'm so light-headed i'll black out in a matter of minutes. i've got to get away

here!  i'm  here!â€  he  won't  make  it.  not  with  that leg  in  the  night.  he  will  never  make  it  in

it's  working.  i  can  hear  them  coming.  two  of  them.  crashing  through  the  jungle.  my 
knees start to give out and i sink down next to  beetee, resting  my weight on my  heels. my 
bow and arrow lift into position. if i can take them out, will peeta survive the rest? 

enobaria and finnick reach the lightning tree. they can't see me, sitting above them on the 
slope, my skin camouflaged in ointment. i home in on enobaria's neck. with any luck, when 
i kill her, finnick will duck behind the tree for cover just as the lightning bolt strikes. and it 
will be any second. there's only a faint insect click here and there. i can kill them no

â€œkatniss!â€ peeta's  voice  howls  for  me. but this time i don't answer. beetee still  breathes 
faintly beside me. he and i will soon die. finnick and enobaria will die. peeta is alive. two 
cannons  have  sounded.  brutus,  johanna,  chaff.  two  of  them  are  already  dead.  that  will 
leave peeta with only one tribute to kill. and that is the very best i can do. one enemy.

haymitch's  last  words  of  advice  to  me.  why  would  i  need  reminding?  i  have  always 
known who the enemy is. who starves and tortures and kills us in the arena. who will soon 
kill everyone i love. 

my  bow  drops  as  his  meaning  registers.  yes,  i  know  who  the  enemy  is.  and  it's  not 

enobaria. 

i finally see beetee's knife with clear eyes. my shaking hands slide the wire from the hilt, 
wind  it  around  the  arrow  just  above  the  feathers,  and  secure  it  with  a  knot  picked  up  in 
training. 

i rise, turning to the force field, fully revealing myself but no longer caring. only caring 
about where i  should direct  my tip, where beetee would  have driven the knife  if  he'd  been 
able to choose. my bow tilts up at the wavering square, the flaw, the ... what did he call it that

finnick. my mind struggles to make sense of the conversation, of the fact that it's taking 
place  between  plutarch  heavensbee  and  finnick.  is  he  so  near  and  dear  to the  capitol  that 
he'll be excused his crimes? or did he really have no idea what beetee intended? he croaks 
out something else. something heavy with despair.

want you to ask any questions until i'm through. do you understand?â€ 

i nod numbly. and this is what he tells me. 

there was a plan to break us out of the arena from the moment the quell was announced. 
the  victor  tributes  from  3,  4,  6,  7,  8,  and  11  had  varying  degrees  of  knowledge  about  it. 
plutarch  heavensbee  has  been,  for  several  years,  part  of  an  undercover  group  aiming  to 
overthrow the capitol. he made sure the wire was among the weapons. beetee was in charge 
of blowing a hole in the force field. the bread we received in the arena was code for the time 
of the rescue. the district where the bread originated indicated the day. three. the number of 
rolls  the  hour.  twenty-four.  the  hovercraft  belongs  to  district  13.  bonnie  and  twill,  the 
women i met in the woods from 8, were right about its existence and its defense capabilities. 
we  are  currently  on  a  very  roundabout  journey  to  district  13.  meanwhile,  most  of
