[CHARACTER]  - 
      [CHARACTER] is described by dowell as young, gentle, and "so submissive." only twenty-three years old, mrs. maidan is recently married to a young man about the same age, although his job in the army keeps them separated. though maisie is indeed vulnerable to those who seek to trick her, it is questionable whether she is truly submissive, as dowell assumes. from the same convent school as leonora, mrs. maidan preserves some of the strict morality that was once taught to her.
