  speed. shee that your worship loues?
  val. why, how know you that i am in loue?
  speed. marry by these speciall markes: first, you haue
learn'd (like sir protheus) to wreath your armes like a
male-content: to rellish a loue-song, like a robin-redbreast:
to walke alone like one that had the pestilence:
to sigh, like a schoole-boy that had lost his a.b.c. to
weep like a yong wench that had buried her grandam:
to fast, like one that takes diet: to watch, like one that
feares robbing: to speake puling, like a beggar at hallow-masse:
you were wont, when you laughed, to crow

ike a cocke; when you walk'd, to walke like one of the

when you look'd sadly, it was for want of money: and
now you are metamorphis'd with a mistris, that when i
looke on you, i can hardly thinke you my master

   val. are all these things perceiu'd in me?
  speed. they are all perceiu'd without ye

   val. without me? they cannot

   speed. without you? nay, that's certaine: for without
you were so simple, none else would: but you are
so without these follies, that these follies are within you,
and shine through you like the water in an vrinall: that
not an eye that sees you, but is a physician to comment
on your malady

   val. but tell me: do'st thou know my lady siluia?

   val. what dost thou know?
  speed. that shee is not so faire, as (of you) well-fauourd?
  val. i meane that her beauty is exquisite,
but her fauour infinite

   speed. that's because the one is painted, and the other
out of all count

   val. how painted? and how out of count?
  speed. marry sir, so painted to make her faire, that no
man counts of her beauty

   speed. you neuer saw her since she was deform'd

and still i see her beautifull

his hose; and you, beeing in loue, cannot see to put on
your hose

   val. belike (boy) then you are in loue, for last morning
you could not see to wipe my shooes

   speed. true sir: i was in loue with my bed, i thanke
you, you swing'd me for my loue, which makes mee the
