    well, bring our lady hither to our sight;
    and once again, a pot o' th' smallest ale.
  second servant. will't please your mightiness to wash your
hands?
    o, how we joy to see your wit restor'd!
    o, that once more you knew but what you are!
    these fifteen years you have been in a dream;
    or, when you wak'd, so wak'd as if you slept.
  sly. these fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.
