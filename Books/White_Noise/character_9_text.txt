possessions carry such sorrowful weight? there is a darkness attached to them, a foreboding. they make
me wary not of personal failure and defeat but of something more general, something large in scope and
content.

downstairs  and  we  talked  about  the  school  supplies  they  would  need.  soon  it  was  time  for  lunch.  we
entered a period of chaos and noise. we milled about, bickered a little, dropped utensils. finally we were
all satisfied with what we'd been able to snatch from the cupboards and refrigerator or swipe from each
other and we began quietly plastering mustard or mayonnaise on our brightly colored food. the mood

elbowed each other twice, although neither spoke. wilder was still seated on the counter surrounded by
open cartons, crumpled tinfoil, shiny bags of potato chips, bowls of pasty substances covered with plastic
wrap, flip-top rings and twist ties, individually wrapped slices of orange cheese. heinrich came in, studied
the scene carefully, my only son, then walked out the back door and disappeared.

we walked home under a marigold moon. our house looked old and wan at the end of the street,
the porch light shining on a molded plastic tricycle, a stack of three-hour colored-flame sawdust and wax
logs.  denise  was  doing  her  homework  in  the  kitchen,  keeping  an  eye  on  wilder,  who  had  wandered

wilder was in there watching heinrich do a physics experiment with steel balls and a salad bowl.
heinrich wore a terry cloth robe, a towel around his neck, another towel on his head. he told me to look
downstairs.

babette  came  in  from  running,  her  outfit  soaked  through.  murray  walked  across  the  kitchen  to

could see it in her eyes, a sardonic connection. it was these secondary levels of life, these extrasensory

denise  and  steffie  stayed  home  that  week  as  men  in  mylex  suits  and  respirator  masks  made
systematic  sweeps  of  the  building  with  infrared  detecting  and  measuring  equipment.  because  mylex  is
itself  a  suspect  material,  the  results  tended  to  be  ambiguous  and  a  second  round  of  more  rigorous
detection had to be scheduled.

the two girls and babette, wilder and i went to the supermarket. minutes after we entered, we ran
into  murray.  this  was  the  fourth  or  fifth  time  i'd  seen  him  in  the  supermarket,  which  was  roughly  the

babette said, "where is wilder?" and turned to stare at me in a way that suggested ten minutes
had  passed  since  she'd  last  seen  him.  other  looks,  less  pensive  and  less  guilty,  indicated  greater  time

the blanker the look, the more dangerous the situation. it was as if guilt were a luxury she allowed herself

i scooped wilder off a chair and gave him a noisy kiss on the ear and he shrank away in delight.

she would read to mr. treadwell, the blind old man who lived there with his sister. wilder sat between us,
playing with the supermarket tabloids that treadwell favored as reading matter. as a volunteer reader to
the blind,  babette had some reservations about  the old gent's appetite for  the unspeakable and seamy,
believing that the handicapped were morally bound to higher types of entertainment. if we couldn't look to
them for victories of the human. spirit, who could we look to? they had an example to set just as she did

kitchen  floor  and  looking  through  the  oven  window,  and  we  ate  dinner  quickly,  moving  around  him  or
stepping over him to reach the stove and refrigerator. babette watched him as she ate. she had a class to

"we'll take him to the doctor," i said. "then i'll drop you at the church."

"would the doctor see a crying child? besides, his doctor doesn't have hours now."

"what about your doctor?"

"i think he does. but a crying child, jack. what can i say to the man? 'my child is crying.'"

"is there a condition more basic?"


there'd been no sense of crisis until now. just exasperation and despair. but once we decided to
visit  the  doctor,  we  began  to  hurry,  to  fret.  we  looked  for  wilder's  jacket  and  shoes,  tried  to  remember
what he'd eaten in the last twenty-four hours, anticipated questions the doctor would ask and rehearsed
our answers carefully. it seemed vital to agree on the answers even if we weren't sure they were correct.

and intensity. babette said nothing, i kept my eyes on the road. he sat between us, looking into the radio.

fragments that were mainly fabricated. as the camera pulled back to allow babette to demonstrate some

a dreaming mound. her hands, feet and face were drawn under the sheltering coat; only a burst of hair
remained.  i  fell  at  once  into  marine  oblivion,  a  deep-dwelling  crablike  consciousness,  silent  and
dreamless.

the supermarket is full of elderly people who look lost among the dazzling hedgerows. some people are
too small to reach the upper shelves; some people block the aisles with their carts; some are clumsy and
slow  to  react;  some  are  forgetful,  some  confused;  some  move  about  muttering  with  the  wary  look  of
people in institutional corridors.
i pushed my cart along the aisle. wilder sat inside, on the collapsible shelf, trying to grab items

whose shape and radiance excited his system of sensory analysis. there were two new developments in
the supermarket, a butcher's corner and a bakery, and the oven aroma of bread and cake combined with
the sight of a bloodstained man pounding at strips of living veal was pretty exciting for us all.

i saw murray in the generic food area, carrying a teflon skillet. i stopped to watch him for a while.
he talked to four or five people, occasionally pausing to scrawl some notes in a spiral book. he managed
to write with the skillet wedged awkwardly under his arm.
wilder called out to him, a tree-top screech, and i wheeled the cart over.

"fine," i said.

"does this kid talk yet?"

"now and then. he likes to pick his spots."

"i can picture him so clearly."

"it's strange in a way, isn't it," he said, "that we can picture the dead."


i took wilder along the fruit bins. the fruit was gleaming and wet, hard-edged. there was a self-
conscious quality about it. it looked carefully observed, like four-color fruit in a guide to photography. we
veered right at the plastic jugs of spring water and headed for the checkout. i liked being with wilder. the
world was a series of fleeting gratifications. he took what he could, then immediately forgot it in the rush of
a subsequent pleasure. it was this forgetfulness i envied and admired.

and expanded in unnameable ways.

i was surprised, entering our bedroom, to find babette standing at a window looking out into the
steely night. she gave no sign that she'd noticed my absence from the bed and did not seem to hear when
i climbed back in, burying myself beneath the covers.

fascinated by the process. i wondered if he'd uncovered some splendid connection between things he'd
always thought of as separate. the kitchen is routinely rich in such moments, perhaps for me as much as
for him.

object.  it  was wilder, standing two feet from  the bed, gazing  into  my face.  we spent  a long  moment in
mutual contemplation. his great round head, set as it was on a small-limbed and squattish body, gave him
the look of a primitive clay figurine, some household idol of obscure and cultic derivation. i had the feeling
he wanted to show me something. as i slipped quietly out of bed, he walked in his quilted booties out of

overwhelming, a fist clenching repeatedly in my chest. who was he, what was happening here? i realized
wilder was no longer next to me. i reached the doorway to his room just in time to see his head sink into
the pillow. by the time i got to the bed, he was fast asleep. i didn't know what to do. i felt cold, white. i
worked my way back to the window, gripping a doorknob, a handrail, as if to remind myself of the nature

street  and  pedaled  noisily  to  the  dead  end.  he  walked  the  tricycle  around  the  guard  rail  and  then  rode
along a paved walkway that went winding past some overgrown lots to a set of twenty concrete steps. the
plastic  wheels rumbled  and screeched. here our reconstruction yields to  the awe-struck account of  two
elderly  women  watching  from  the  second-story  back  porch  of  a  tall  house

process unfolding before them. the boy pedaled diagonally down the slope, shrewdly reducing the angle
of descent, then paused on the bottom to aim his three-wheeler at the point on the opposite side which
seemed to represent the shortest distance across. hey, sonny, no. waving their arms, looking frantically

trees  across  the  expressway.  this  frightened  them  all  the  more.  they  called  and  waved,  were

alertly pulled over, got out of  the car, skidded down  the embankment and lifted  the boy from the murky
shallows, holding him aloft for the clamoring elders to see.

we go to the overpass all the time. babette, wilder and i. we take a thermos of iced tea, park the
car, watch the setting sun. clouds are no deterrent. clouds intensify the drama, trap and shape the light.
heavy overcasts have little effect. light bursts through, tracers and smoky arcs. overcasts enhance the
mood.  we  find  little  to  say  to  each  other.  more  cars  arrive,  parking  in  a  line  that  extends  down  to  the
residential  zone.  people  walk  up  the  incline  and  onto  the  overpass,  carrying  fruit  and  nuts,  cool  dri
