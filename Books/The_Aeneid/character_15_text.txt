  (a horrid sight!) ev'n in the hero's view,
  from stem to stern by waves was overborne:
  the trembling pilot, from his rudder torn,
  was headlong hurl'd; thrice round the ship was toss'd,
  then bulg'd at once, and in the deep was lost;
  and here and there above the waves were seen
  arms, pictures, precious goods, and floating men.
  the stoutest vessel to the storm gave way,
  and suck'd thro' loosen'd planks the rushing sea.
  ilioneus was her chief: alethes old,
  achates faithful, abas young and bold,
  endur'd not less; their ships, with gaping seams,
  admit the deluge of the briny streams.

  meantime imperial neptune heard the sound
  of raging billows breaking on the ground.
  displeas'd, and fearing for his wat'ry reign,
  he rear'd his awful head above the main,
  serene in majesty; then roll'd his eyes
  around the space of earth, and seas, and skies.
  he saw the trojan fleet dispers'd, distress'd,
  by stormy winds and wintry heav'n oppress'd.

  but, when the sun restor'd the cheerful day,
  he rose, the coast and country to survey,
  anxious and eager to discover more.
  it look'd a wild uncultivated shore;
  but, whether humankind, or beasts alone
  possess'd the new-found region, was unknown.
  beneath a ledge of rocks his fleet he hides:
  tall trees surround the mountain's shady sides;
  the bending brow above a safe retreat provides.
  arm'd with two pointed darts, he leaves his friends,
  and true achates on his steps attends.
  lo! in the deep recesses of the wood,
  before his eyes his goddess mother stood:
  a huntress in her habit and her mien;
  her dress a maid, her air confess'd a queen.
  bare were her knees, and knots her garments bind;
  loose was her hair, and wanton'd in the wind;
  her hand sustain'd a bow; her quiver hung behind.
  she seem'd a virgin of the spartan blood:
  with such array harpalyce bestrode
  her thracian courser and outstripp'd the rapid flood.
  "ho, strangers!

  of so renown'd and so desir'd a guest."

  rais'd in his mind the trojan hero stood,
  and long'd to break from out his ambient cloud:
  achates found it, and thus urg'd his way:
  "from whence, o goddess-born, this long delay?
  what more can you desire, your welcome sure,
  your fleet in safety, and your friends secure?
  one only wants; and him we saw in vain
  oppose the storm, and swallow'd in the main.
  orontes in his fate our forfeit paid;
  the rest agrees with what your mother said."
  scarce had he spoken, when the cloud gave way,
  the mists flew upward and dissolv'd in day.

  unknowing whom the sacred sibyl meant.
  achates, the companion of his breast,

  they join their hands; a secret seat they choose;
  th' arcadian first their former talk renews:
  "undaunted prince, i never can believe

  but feeble are the succors i can send.

  scarce had he said; achates and his guest,
  with downcast eyes, their silent grief express'd;
  who, short of succors, and in deep despair,
  shook at the dismal prospect of the war.
  but his bright mother, from a breaking cloud,
  to cheer her issue, thunder'd thrice aloud;
  thrice forky lightning flash'd along the sky,
  and tyrrhene trumpets thrice were heard on high.

  his servants bore him off, and softly laid
  his languish'd limbs upon his homely bed.

  aeneas at their head, achates by his side.

 wretched cydon had receiv'd his doom,
  who courted clytius in his beardless bloom,
  and sought with lust obscene polluted joys:
  the trojan sword had curd his love of boys,
  had not his sev'n bold brethren stopp'd the course
  of the fierce champions, with united force.
  sev'n darts were thrown at once; and some rebound
  from his bright shield, some on his helmet sound:
  the rest had reach'd him; but his mother's care
  prevented those, and turn'd aside in air.

  the prince then call'd achates, to supply
  the spears that knew the way to victory-
  "those fatal weapons, which, inur'd to blood,
  in grecian bodies under ilium stood:
  not one of those my hand shall toss in vain
  against our foes, on this contended plain."
  he said; then seiz'd a mighty spear, and threw;
  which, wing'd with fate, thro' maeon's buckler flew,
  pierc'd all the brazen plates, and reach'd his heart:
  he stagger'd with intolerable smart.

  from the same hand, and sent with equal force,
  his right arm pierc'd, and holding on, bereft
  his use of both, and pinion'd down his left.
  then numitor from his dead brother drew
  th' ill-omen'd spear, and at the trojan threw:
  preventing fate directs the lance awry,
  which, glancing, only mark'd achates' thigh.

  in pride of youth the sabine clausus came,
  and, from afar, at dryops took his aim.
  the spear flew hissing thro' the middle space,
  and pierc'd his throat, directed at his face;
  it stopp'd at once the passage of his wind,
  and the free soul to flitting air resign'd:
  his forehead was the first that struck the ground;

  then call'd for aid: but, while he cried in vain,
  the chariot bore him backward on the plain.
  he lies revers'd; the victor king descends,
  and strikes so justly where his helmet ends,
  he lops the head. the latian fields are drunk
  with streams that issue from the bleeding trunk.

  while he triumphs, and while the trojans yield,
  the wounded prince is forc'd to leave the field:
  strong mnestheus, and achates often tried,
  and young ascanius, weeping by his side,
  conduct him to his tent. scarce can he rear
  his limbs from earth, supported on his spear.
  resolv'd in mind, regardless of the smart,
  he tugs with both his hands, and breaks the dart.
  the steel remains. no readier way he found
  to draw the weapon, than t' inlarge the wound.

  the truce was broken, and whose lance, embrued
  with trojan blood, th' unhappy fight renew'd.
  loud shouts and clamors rend the liquid sky,
