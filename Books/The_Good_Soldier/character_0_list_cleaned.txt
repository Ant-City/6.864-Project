[CHARACTER] - 
      the novel's narrator, [CHARACTER] is the reader's only guide through the twisted story of the thirteen years the couple spent in france. he is a naive man, quickly taken in by appearances, and easily cuckolded by his wife* he tells the disjointed story of his own gradual understanding of what has occurred. ultimately, he is a man who has lost all moral certitude, all comprehension of right and wrong. he is described by several literary critics as the quintessential "modern man."
