yes.
  loud peals of thunder from the poles ensue;
  then flashing fires the transient light renew;
  the face of things a frightful image bears,
  and present death in various forms appears.
  struck with unusual fright, the trojan chief,
  with lifted hands and eyes, invokes relief;
  and, "thrice and four times happy those," he cried,
  "that under ilian walls before their parents died!
  tydides, bravest of the grecian train!
  why could not i by that strong arm be slain,
  and lie by noble hector on the plain,
  or great sarpedon, in those bloody fields
  where simois rolls the bodies and the shields
  of heroes, whose dismember'd hands yet bear
  the dart aloft, and clench the pointed spear!"

  thus while the pious prince his fate bewails,
  fierce boreas drove against his flying sails,
  and rent the sheets; the raging billows rise,
  and mount the tossing vessels to the skies:
  nor can the shiv'ring oars sustain the blow;
  the galley gives her side, and turns her prow;

  the hostile spear, yet sticking in his wound,
  with tracks of blood inscrib'd the dusty ground.
  meantime the trojan dames, oppress'd with woe,
  to pallas' fane in long procession go,
  in hopes to reconcile their heav'nly foe.
  they weep, they beat their breasts, they rend their hair,
  and rich embroider'd vests for presents bear;
  but the stern goddess stands unmov'd with pray'r.
  thrice round the trojan walls achilles drew
  the corpse of hector, whom in fight he slew.
  here priam sues; and there, for sums of gold,
  the lifeless body of his son is sold.
  so sad an object, and so well express'd,
  drew sighs and groans from the griev'd hero's breast,
  to see the figure of his lifeless friend,
  and his old sire his helpless hand extend.
  himself he saw amidst the grecian train,
  mix'd in the bloody battle on the plain;
  and swarthy memnon in his arms he knew,
  his pompous ensigns, and his indian crew.

  with peals of shouts the tyrians praise the song:
  those peals are echo'd by the trojan throng.
  th' unhappy queen with talk prolong'd the night,
  and drank large draughts of love with vast delight;
  of priam much enquir'd, of hector more;
  then ask'd what arms the swarthy memnon wore,
  what troops he landed on the trojan shore;
  the steeds of diomede varied the discourse,
  and fierce achilles, with his matchless force;
  at length, as fate and her ill stars requir'd,
  to hear the series of the war desir'd.
  "relate at large, my godlike guest," she said,
  "the grecian stratagems, the town betray'd:

  "'t was in the dead of night, when sleep repairs
  our bodies worn with toils, our minds with cares,

  a bloody shroud he seem'd, and bath'd in tears;
  such as he was, when, by pelides slain,
  thessalian coursers dragg'd him o'er the plain.
  swoln were his feet, as when the thongs were thrust
  thro' the bor'd holes; his body black with dust;

  with eyes dejected, in a lowly tone,
  after a modest pause she thus begun:

  and fruitless tears came trickling from her eyes.

  "at length her lord descends upon the plain,

  a noble present to my son she brought,
  a robe with flow'rs on golden tissue wrought,
  a phrygian vest; and loads with gifts beside

  and drew the wonder of the gazing throng.

  his lifted arms around his head he throws,

  they would have chang'd the fortune of the fight:
  th' invasion of the greeks had been return'd,

  the long defense the trojan people made,

  then with a close embrace he strain'd his son,
  and, kissing thro' his helmet, thus begun:
  "my son, from my example learn the war,
  in camps to suffer, and in fields to dare;
  but happier chance than mine attend thy care!
  this day my hand thy tender age shall shield,
  and crown with honors of the conquer'd field:
  thou, when thy riper years shall send thee forth
  to toils of war, be mindful of my worth;
  assert thy birthright, and in arms be known,
  for hector's nephew, and aeneas' son."
  he said; and, striding, issued on the plain.
  anteus and mnestheus, and a num'rous train,
  attend his steps; the rest their weapons take,
  and, crowding to the field, the camp forsake.
  a cloud of blinding dust is rais'd around,
