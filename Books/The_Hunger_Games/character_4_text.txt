t mask so that no one could ever 
read my thoughts. do my work quietly in school. make only 
polite small talk in the public market. discuss little more than 
trades in the hob, which is the black market where i make 
most of my money. even at home, where i am less pleasant, i 
avoid discussing tricky topics. like the reaping, or food short-
ages, or the hunger games. prim might begin to repeat my 
words and then where would we be? 
in the woods waits the only person with whom i can be 
myself. gale. i can feel the muscles in my face relaxing, my 
pace quickening as i climb the hills to our place, a rock ledge 
overlooking a valley. a thicket of berry bushes protects it from 
unwanted eyes. the sight of him waiting there brings on a 
smile. gale says i never smile except in the woods.

â€œhey, catnip,â€ says gale. my real name is katniss, but when 
i first told him, i had barely whispered it. so he thought iâ€™d 
said catnip. then when this crazy lynx started following me 
aroun

â€œlook what i shot,â€ gale holds up a loaf of bread with an ar-
row stuck in it, and i laugh. itâ€™s real bakery bread, not the flat, 
dense loaves we make from our grain rations. i take it in my 
hands, pull out the arrow, and hold the puncture in the crust 
to my nose, inhaling the fragrance that makes my mouth flood 
with saliva. fine bread like this is for special occasions. 
â€œmm, still warm,â€ i say. he must have been at the bakery at 
the crack of dawn to trade for it. â€œwhat did it cost you?â€

â€œwell, we all feel a little closer today, donâ€™t we?â€ i say, not 
even bothering to roll my eyes. â€œprim left us a cheese.â€ i pull it 
out. his expression brightens at the treat. â€œthank you, prim. 
weâ€™ll have a real feast.â€ suddenly he falls into a capitol accent 
as he mimics effie trinket, the maniacally upbeat woman who 
arrives once a year to read out the names at the leaping. â€œi al-
most forgot! happy hunger games!â€ he plucks a few black-

tosses a berry in a high arc toward me.

i catch it in my mouth and break the delicate skin with my 
teeth. the sweet tartness explodes across my tongue. â€œâ€” be 
ever in your favor!â€ i finish with equal verve. we have to joke 
about it because the alternative is to be scared out of your 
wits. besides, the capitol accent is so affected, almost anything 
sounds funny in it. 
i watch as gale pulls out his knife and slices the bread. he 
could be my brother. straight black hair, olive skin, we even 
have the same gray eyes. but weâ€™re not related, at least not 
closely. most of the families who work the mines resemble 
one another this way. 
thatâ€™s why my mother and prim, with their light hair and 
blue eyes, always look out of place. they are. my motherâ€™s 
parents were part of the small merchant class that caters to 
officials, peacekeepers, and the occasional seam customer.

holiday, if all the day off meant was roaming the mountains 
with gale, hunting for tonightâ€™s supper. but instead we have to 
be standing in the square at two oâ€™clock waiting for the names 
to be called out. 
â€œwe could do it, you know,â€ gale says quietly. 
â€œwhat?â€ i ask. 
â€œleave the district. run off. live in the woods. you and i, we 
could make it,â€ says gale. 
i donâ€™t know how to respond. the idea is so preposterous. 
â€œif we didnâ€™t have so many kids,â€ he adds quickly. 
theyâ€™re not our kids, of course. but they might as well be. 
galeâ€™s two little brothers and a sister. prim. and you may as 
well throw in our mothers, too, because how would they live 
without us? who would fill those mouths that are always ask-
ing for more? with both of us hunting daily, there are still 
nights when game has to be swapped for lard or shoelaces or 
wool,

prim, who is the only person in the world iâ€™m certain i love? 
and gale is devoted to his family. we canâ€™t leave, so why both-
er talking about it? and even if we did . . . even if we did . . . 
where did this stuff about having kids come from? thereâ€™s 
never been anything romantic between gale and me. when we 
met, i was a skinny twelve-year-old, and although he was only 
two years older, he already looked like a man. it took a long 
time for us to even become friends, to stop haggling over 
every trade and begin helping each other out. 
besides, if he wants k

the girls whisper about him when he walks by in school that 
they want him. it makes me jealous but not for the reason 
people would think. good hunting partners are hard to find. 
â€œwhat do you want to do?â€ i ask. we can hunt, fish, or gath-

found the patch a few years ago, but gale had the idea to 
string mesh nets around it to keep out the animals. 
on the way home, we swing by the hob, the black market 
that operates in an abandoned warehouse that once held coal. 
when they came up with a more efficient system that trans-
ported the coal directly from the mines to the trains, the hob 
gradually took over the space. most businesses are closed by 
this time on reaping day, but the black marketâ€™s still fairly

madge shoots him a look, trying to see if itâ€™s a genuine 
compliment or if heâ€™s just being ironic. it is a pretty dress, but 
she would never be wearing it ordinarily. she presses her lips 
together and then smiles. â€œwell, if i end up going to the capi-
tol, i want to look nice, donâ€™t i?â€ 
now itâ€™s galeâ€™s turn to be confused. does she mean it? or is 
she messing with him? iâ€™m guessing the second. 
â€œyou wonâ€™t be going to the capitol,â€ says gale coolly. his 
eyes land on a

months. â€œwhat can you have? five entries? i had six when i 
was just twelve years old.â€ 
â€œthatâ€™s not her fault,â€ i say. 
â€œno, itâ€™s no oneâ€™s fault. just the way it is,â€ says gale. madgeâ€™s 
face has become closed off. she puts the money for the berries 
in my hand. â€œgood luck, katniss.â€ â€œyou, too,â€ i say, and the 
door closes. 
we walk toward the seam in silence. i donâ€™t like that gale 
took a dig at madge, but heâ€™s right, of course. the reaping sys-
tem is unfair, with the poor getting the worst of it. you be-
come eligible for the reaping the day you turn twelve. that 
year, your name is entered once. at thirteen, twice. and so on

and so on un

more times in exchange 
for tesserae. each tessera is worth a meager yearâ€™s supply of 
grain and oil for one person. you may do this for each of your 
family members as well. so, at the age of twelve, i had my 
name entered four times. once, because i had to, and three 
times for tesserae for grain and oil for myself, prim, and my 
mother. in fact, every year i have needed to do this. and the 
entries are cumulative. so now, at the age of sixteen, my name 
will be in the reaping twenty times. gale, who is eighteen and 
has been either helping or single-handedly feeding a family of 
five for seven years, will have his name in forty-two times. 
you can see why someone like madge, who has never been 
at risk of needing a tessera, can set him off. the chance of her 
name being drawn is very slim compared to those of us who 
live in the seam. not impossible, but slim. and even though 
the rules were set up by the capitol, not the districts, certainly 
not madgeâ€™s family, itâ€™s hard not to

resent those who donâ€™t 
have to sign up for tesserae. 
gale knows his anger at madge is misdirected. on other 
days, deep in the woods, iâ€™ve listened to him rant about how 
the tesserae are just another tool to cause misery in our dis-
trict. a way to plant hatred between the starving workers of 
the seam and those who can generally count on supper and

thereby ensure we will never trust one another. â€œitâ€™s to the

might say if there were no ears to hear but mine. if it was

made what iâ€™m sure she thought was a harmless comment. 
as we walk, i glance over at galeâ€™s face, still smoldering un-
derneath his stony expression. his rages seem pointless to me, 
although i never say so. itâ€™s not that i donâ€™t agree with him. i 
do. but what good is yelling about the capitol in the middle of 
the woods? it doesnâ€™t change anything. it doesnâ€™t make things 
fair. it doesnâ€™t fill our stomachs. in fact, it scares off the nearby 
game. i let him yell though. better he does it in the woods than 
in the district.

given on their ages, whether theyâ€™re seam or merchant, if they 
will break down and weep. most refuse dealing with the rack-
eteers but carefully, carefully. these same people tend to be 
informers, and who hasnâ€™t broken the law? i could be shot on 
a daily basis for hunting, but the appetites of those in charge 
protect me. not everyone can claim the same.

anyway, gale and i agree that if we have to choose between 
dying of hunger and a bullet in the head, the bullet would be 
much quicker. 
the space gets tighter, more claustrophobic as people ar-

rected to the adjacent streets, where they can watch the event 
on screens as itâ€™s televised live by the state.

gale has lifted prim off the ground and sheâ€™s thrashing in his

prim is not to take any tesserae. they can get by, if 
theyâ€™re careful, on selling primâ€™s goat milk and cheese and the 
small apothecary business my mother now runs for the people 
in the seam. gale will get her the herbs she doesnâ€™t grow her-
self, but she must be very careful to describe them because 
heâ€™s not as familiar with them as i am. heâ€™ll also bring them 
game â€” he and i made a pact about this a year or so ago â€” 
and will probably not ask for compensation, but they should 
thank him with some kind of trade, like milk or medicine.

the last thing on my mind. 
â€œhere, iâ€™ll put it on your dress, all right?â€ madge doesnâ€™t 
wait for an answer, she just leans in and fixes the bird to my 
dress. â€œpromise youâ€™ll wear it into the arena, katniss?â€ she 
asks. â€œpromise?â€

day. madge gives me one more. a kiss on the cheek. then sheâ€™s 
gone and iâ€™m left thinking that maybe madge really has been 
my friend all along. 
finally, gale is here and maybe there is nothing romantic 
between us, but when he opens his arms i donâ€™t hesitate to go 
into them. his body is familiar to me â€” the way it moves, the 
smell of wood smoke, even the sound of his heart beating i 
know from quiet moments on a hunt â€” but this is the first 
time i really feel it, lean and hard-muscled against my own.

not that easy. even he had to scrap his own work sometimes.

the awful thing is that if i can forget theyâ€™re people, it will 
be no different at all.

the woods immobilized us. later, we wondered if we

at bay. we knew the pair was in trouble as soon as we saw 
them. but we only watched. 
â€œthe hovercraft appeared out of nowhere,â€ i continue to 
peeta. â€œi mean, one moment the sky was empty and the next it 
was there. it didnâ€™t make a sound, but they saw it. a net 
dropped down on the girl and carried her up, fast, so fast like 
the elevator. they shot some sort of spear through the boy. it

into thin air. and the birds began to sing again, as if nothing 
had happened.â€ 
â€œdid they see you?â€ peeta asked. 
â€œi donâ€™t know. we were under a shelf of rock,â€ i reply. 
but i do know. there was a moment, after the birdcall, but 
before the hovercraft, where the girl had seen us. sheâ€™d locked

the wind and the story have blown all the warmth from my 
body. the girlâ€™s scream. had it been her last? 
peeta takes off his jacket and wraps it around my shoul-

a moment to accept both his jacket and his kindness. a friend 
would do that, right? 
â€œthey were from here?â€ he asks, and he secures a button at 
my neck. 
i nod. theyâ€™d had that capitol look about

â€œitâ€™s getting chilly. we better go in,â€ he says. inside the 
dome, itâ€™s warm and bright. his tone is conversational. â€œyour 
friend gale. heâ€™s the one who took your sister away at the 
reaping?â€ 
â€œyes. do you know him?â€ i ask. 
â€œnot really. i hear the girls talk about him a lot. i thought he 
was your cousin or something. you favor each other,â€ he says. 
â€œno, weâ€™re not related,â€ i say. 
peeta nods, unreadable. â€œdid he come to say good-bye to 
you?â€ 
â€œyes,â€ i say, observing him carefully. â€œso did your father. he 
brought me cookies.â€ 
peeta raises his eyebrows as if this is news. but after

â€œsorry, i donâ€™t. katniss. i already know youâ€™re handy with a 
knife,â€ says haymitch. 
â€œnot really. but i can hunt,â€ i say. â€œwith a bow and arrow.â€ 
â€œand youâ€™re good?â€ asks haymitch. 
i have to think about it. iâ€™ve been putting food on the table 
for four years. thatâ€™s no small task. iâ€™m not as good as my fa-
ther was, but heâ€™d had more practice. iâ€™ve better aim than 
gale, but iâ€™ve had more practice. heâ€™s a genius with traps and 
snares. â€œiâ€™m all right,â€ i say. 
â€œsheâ€™s excellent,â€ says peeta. â€œmy father buys her squirrels. 
he always comments on how the arrows never pierce the 
body. she hits every one in the eye. itâ€™s the same with the rab-
bits she sells the butcher. she can even bring down deer.â€ 
this assessment of my skills from peeta takes me totally by 
surprise. first, that he ever noticed. second, that heâ€™s talking 
me up. â€œwha

the crying, has worn me out. i drift off, reprieved, relieved, 
and with the number eleven still flashing behind my eyelids. 
at dawn, i lie in bed for a while, watching the sun come up 
on a beautiful morning. itâ€™s sunday. a day off at home. i won-
der if gale is in the woods yet. usually we devote all of sunday 
to stocking up for the week. rising early, hunting and gather-
ing, then trading at the hob. i think of gale without me. both 
of us can hunt alone, but weâ€™re better as a pair. particularly if 
weâ€™re trying for bigger game. but also in the littler things, hav-
ing a partner lightened the load, could even make the arduous 
task of filling my familyâ€™s table enjoyable.

day in october, the air cool and pungent with dying things. iâ€™d 
spent the morning competing with the squirrels for nuts and 
the slightly warmer afternoon wading in shallow ponds har-
vesting katniss. the only meat iâ€™d shot was a squirrel that had 
practically run over my toes in its quest for acorns, but the an-
imals would still be afoot when the snow buried my other 
food sources. having strayed farther afield than usual, i was

recognized the twitch-up snares because my father had used 
them. when the prey is caught, itâ€™s yanked into the air out of 
the reach of other hungry animals. iâ€™d been trying to use 
snares all summer with no success, so i couldnâ€™t help dropping 
my sacks to examine this one. my fingers were just on the wire

above one of the rabbits when a voice rang out. â€œthatâ€™s dan-

i jumped back several feet as gale materialized from be-
hind a tree. he must have been watching me the whole time. 
he was only fourteen, but he cleared six feet and was as good 
as an adult to me. iâ€™d seen him around the seam and at school. 
and one other time. heâ€™d lost his father in the same blast that 
killed mine. in january, iâ€™d stood by while he received his 
medal of valor in the justice building, another oldest child 
with no father. i remembered his two little brothers clutching 
his mother, a woman whose swolle

he scowled at me, not convinced. â€œso whereâ€™d you get the 
squirrel?â€ 
â€œi shot it.â€ i pulled my bow off my shoulder. i was still using 
the small version my father had made me, but iâ€™d been practic-
ing with the full-size one when i could. i was hoping that by 
spring i might be able to bring down some bigger game. 
galeâ€™s eyes fastened on the bow. â€œcan i see that?â€ i handed 
it over. â€œjust remember, stealingâ€™s punishable by death.â€

that was the first time i ever saw him smile. it transformed 
him from someone menacing to someone you wished you 
knew. but it took several months before i returned that smile. 
we talked hunting then. i told him i might be able to get 
him a bow if he had something to trade. not food. i wanted 
knowledge. i wanted to set my own snares that caught a belt

of fat rabbits in one day. he agreed something might be 
worked out. as the seasons went by, we grudgingly began to 
share our knowledge, our weapons, our secret places that 
were thick with wild plums or turkeys. he taught me snares 
and fishing. i showed him what plants to eat and eventually 
gave him one of our precious bows. and then one day, without 
either of us saying it, we became a team. dividing the work 
and the spoils. making sure that both our families had food. 
gale gave me a sense of security iâ€™d lacked since my fatherâ€™s 
death. his companionship replaced the long solitary hours in 
the woods. i became a much better hunter when i didnâ€™t have 
to look over my shoulder constantly, when someone was 
watching my back. but he turned into so much more than a 
hunting partner. he became my confidante, someone with 
whom i could share thoughts i could never voice inside the 
fence. in exchange, he trusted me with his. being out in the 
woods with gale . . .

 sometimes i was actually happy. 
i call him my friend, but in the last year itâ€™s seemed too ca-

for improvement there.â€ and then heâ€™d give me a smile and iâ€™d

t hesitating now. 
i canâ€™t help comparing what i have with gale to what iâ€™m 
pretending to have with peeta. how i never question galeâ€™s 
motives while i do nothing but doubt the latterâ€™s. itâ€™s not a fair 
comparison really. gale and i were thrown together by a mu-
tual need to survive. peeta and i know the otherâ€™s survival 
means our own death. how do you sidestep that? 
effieâ€™s knocking at the door, reminding me thereâ€™s another 
â€œbig, big, big day!â€ ahead. tomorrow night will be our tele-
vised interviews. i guess the whole team will have their hands

my spirit. this is a new thought. iâ€™m not sure exactly what it 
means, but it suggests iâ€™m a fighter. in a sort of brave way. itâ€™s 
not as if iâ€™m never friendly. okay, maybe i donâ€™t go around lov-
ing everybody i meet, maybe my smiles are hard to come by, 
but i do care for some people. 
cinna takes my icy hands in his warm ones. â€œsuppose, when 
you answer the questions, you think youâ€™re addressing a 
friend back home. who would your best friend be?â€ asks cin-
na. â€œgale,â€ i say instantly. â€œonly it doesnâ€™t make sense, cinna. i 
would never be telling gale those things about me. he already 
knows them.â€ 
â€œwhat about me? could you think of me as a friend?â€ asks 
cinna. of all the people iâ€™ve met since i left home, cinna is by far 
my favorite. i liked him right off and he hasnâ€™t disappointed 
me yet. â€œi think so, but â€”â€

i donâ€™t know what to think. â€œi should have been told, so i 
didnâ€™t look so stupid.â€ 
â€œno, your reaction was perfect. if youâ€™d known, it wouldnâ€™t 
have read as real,â€ says portia. 
â€œsheâ€™s just worried about her boyfriend,â€ says peeta gruffly, 
tossing away a bloody piece of the urn. 
my cheeks burn again at the thought of gale. â€œi donâ€™t have a 
boyfriend.â€ 
â€œwhatever,â€ says peeta. â€œbut i bet heâ€™s smart enough to 
know a bluff when he sees it. besides you didnâ€™t say you loved 
me. so what does it matter?â€ 
the words are sinking in. my anger fading. iâ€™m torn now be-
tween thinking iâ€™ve been used and thinking iâ€™ve been given an 
edge. haymitch is right. i survived my interview, but what was

the simpleminded girl who has to be taken seriously because 
of her eleven. because she can use a bow and arrow. which 
peeta knows better than anyone. 
but he hasnâ€™t told them yet. is he saving that information 
because he knows itâ€™s all that keeps him alive? is he still pre-
tending to love me for the audience? what is going on in his 
head? suddenly, the birds fall silent. then one gives a high-
pitched warning call. a single note. just like the one gale and i 
heard when the redheaded avox girl was caught. high above 
the dying campfire a hovercraft materializes. a set of huge 
metal teeth drops down. slowly, gently, the dead tribute girl is 
lifted into the hovercraft. then it vanishes. the birds resume 
their song. 
â€œmove,â€ i whisper to myself. i wriggle out of my sleeping 
bag, roll it up, and place it in the pack. i take a deep breath. 
while iâ€™ve been concealed by darkness and the sleeping bag 
and the willow branches, it has probab

this  could  be  it, i think. what chance do i have against 
them? all six are there, the five careers and peeta, and my on-
ly consolation is theyâ€™re pretty beat-up, too. even so, look at 
their weapons. look at their faces, grinning and snarling at 
me, a sure kill above them. it seems pretty hopeless. but then 
something else registers. theyâ€™re bigger and stronger than i 
am, no doubt, but theyâ€™re also heavier. thereâ€™s a reason itâ€™s me 
and not gale who ventures up to pluck the highest fruit, or rob 
the most remote bird nests. i must weigh at least fifty or sixty 
pounds less than the smallest career. 
now i smile. â€œhowâ€™s everything with you?â€ i call down 
cheerfully. 
this takes them aback, but i know the crowd will love it. 
â€œwell enough,â€ says the boy from district 2. â€œyourself?â€ 
â€œitâ€™s been a bit warm for my taste,â€ i say. i can almost hear 
the laughter from the capitol. â€œthe airâ€™s better up here. why

â€œno,â€ says cato, pushing away the bow. â€œiâ€™ll do better with 
my sword.â€ i can see the weapon, a short, heavy blade at his 
belt. i give cato time to hoist himself into the tree before i begin 
to climb again. gale always says i remind him of a squirrel the 
way i can scurry up even the slenderest limb. part of itâ€™s my 
weight, but part of itâ€™s practice. you have to know where to 
place your hands and feet. iâ€™m another thirty feet in the air 
when i hear the crack and look down to see cato flailing as he 
and a branch go down. he hits the ground hard and iâ€™m hoping 
he possibly broke his neck when he gets back to his feet, 
swearing like a fiend.

tempt to kill them. thatâ€™s where the tracker part of the name 
comes from. 
after the war, the capitol destroyed all the nests surround-
ing their city, but the ones near the districts were left un-
touched. another reminder of our weakness, i suppose, just 
like the hunger games. another reason to keep inside the 
fence of district 12. when gale and i come across a tracker 
jacker nest, we immediately head in the opposite direction. 
so is that what hangs above me? i look back to rue for help, 
but sheâ€™s melted into her tree. 
given my circumstances, i guess it doesnâ€™t matter what 
type of wasp nest it is. iâ€™m wounded and trapped. darkness 
has given me a brief reprieve, but by the time the sun rises, 
the careers will have formulated a plan to kill me. thereâ€™s no 
way they could do otherwise after iâ€™ve made them look so

her in. but then again . . . the tracker jackers wouldâ€™ve had to 
catch her, and she had a good head start. 
a foul, rotten taste pervades my mouth, and the water has 
little effect on it. i drag myself over to the honeysuckle bush 
and pluck a flower. i gently pull the stamen through the blos-
som and set the drop of nectar on my tongue. the sweetness 
spreads through my mouth, down my throat, warming my 
veins with memories of summer, and my home woods and 
galeâ€™s presence beside me. for some reason, our discussion 
from that last morning comes back to me. 
and suddenly, iâ€™m not thinking of gale but of peeta and . . . 
peeta!  he  saved  my  life! i think. because by the time we met 
up, i couldnâ€™t tell what was real and what the tracker jacker 

â€œwe could do it, you know.â€

i wonder what gale made of the incident for a moment and 
then i push the whole thing out of my mind because for some 
reason gale and peeta do not coexist well together in my 
thoughts. 
so i focus on the one really good thing thatâ€™s happened 
since i landed in the arena. i have a bow and arrows! a full 
dozen arrows if you count the one i retrieved in the tree. they 
bear no trace of the noxious green slime that came from 
glimmerâ€™s body â€” which leads me to believe that might not 
have been wholly real â€” but they have a fair amount of dried 
blood on them. i can clean them later, but i do take a minute to

â€œthey arrest you or something?â€ i ask. 
â€œthey whip you and make everyone else watch,â€ says rue. 
â€œthe mayorâ€™s very strict about it.â€ 
i can tell by her expression that itâ€™s not that uncommon an 
occurrence. a public whippingâ€™s a rare thing in district 12, al-
though occasionally one occurs. technically, gale and i could 
be whipped on a daily basis for poaching in the woods â€” well,

technically, we could get a whole lot worse â€” except all the 
officials buy our meat. besides, our mayor, madgeâ€™s father,

the least prestigious, poorest, most ridiculed district in the 
country has its advantages. such as, being largely ignored by 
the capitol as long as we produce our coal quotas.

â€œyou be careful,â€ she says to me. 
â€œyou, too,â€ i say. i turn and head back to the stream, feeling 
somehow worried. about rue being killed, about rue not be-
ing killed and the two of us being left for last, about leaving 
rue alone, about leaving prim alone back home. no, prim has 
my mother and gale and a baker who has promised she wonâ€™t 
go hungry. rue has only me. 
once i reach the stream, i have only to follow it downhill to 
the place i initially picked it up after the tracker jacker attack. 
i have to be cautious as i move along the water though, be-

death, seems inadequate. itâ€™s the capitol i hate, for doing this 
to all of us. 
galeâ€™s voice is in my head. his ravings against the capitol 
no longer pointless, no longer to be ignored. rueâ€™s death has 
forced me to confront my own fury against the cruelty, the in-
justice they inflict upon us. but here, even more strongly than 
at home, i feel my impotence. thereâ€™s no way to take revenge

then i realize . . . he was my first kill. 
along with other statistics they report to help people place 
their bets, every tribute has a list of kills. i guess technically 
iâ€™d get credited for glimmer and the girl from district 4, too, 
for dumping that nest on them. but the boy from district 1 
was the first person i knew would die because of my actions. 
numerous animals have lost their lives at my hands, but only 
one human. i hear gale saying, â€œhow different can it be, real-
ly?â€ amazingly similar in the execution. a bow pulled, an arrow 
shot. entirely different in the aftermath. i killed a boy whose 
name i donâ€™t even know. somewhere his family is weeping for 
him. his friends call for my blood. maybe he had a girlfriend 
who really believed he would come back . . . 
but then i think of rueâ€™s still body and iâ€™m able to banish 
the boy from my mind. at least, for now.

one out of me.

â€œsomething happy. tell me about the happiest day you can

something between a sigh and a huff of exasperation leaves 
my mouth. a happy story? this will require a lot more effort

them involve gale and me out hunting and somehow i donâ€™t 
think these will play well with either peeta or the audience.

customers by publicly announcing theyâ€™d breaking the law,

lady. it was a friday evening, the day before primâ€™s tenth 
birthday in late may. as soon as school ended, gale and i hit 
the woods, because i wanted to get enough to trade for a 
present for prim. maybe some new cloth for a dress or a hair-
brush. our snares had done well enough and the woods were 
flush with greens, but this was really no more than our aver-
age friday-night haul. i was disappointed as we headed back, 
even though gale said weâ€™d be sure to do better tomorrow. we 
were resting a moment by a stream when we saw him. a 
young buck, probably a yearling by his size. his antlers were

just growing in, still small and coated in velvet. poised to run 
but unsure of us, unfamiliar with humans. beautiful. 
less beautiful perhaps when the two arrows caught him, 
one in the neck, the other in the chest. gale and i had shot at 
the same time. the buck tried to run but stumbled, and galeâ€™s 
knife slit his throat before he knew what had happened. mo-
mentarily, iâ€™d felt a pang at killing something so fresh and in-
nocent. and then my stomach rumbled at the thought of all 
that fresh and innocent meat. 
a deer! gale and i have only brought down three in all. the 
first one, a doe that had injured her leg somehow, almost 
didnâ€™t count. but we knew from that experience not to go 
dragging the carcass into the hob. it had caused chaos with 
people bidding on parts and actually

the butcher, a short, chunky woman named rooba, came to 
the back door when we knocked. you donâ€™t haggle with rooba. 
she gives you one price, which you can take or leave, but itâ€™s a 
fair price. we took her offer on the deer and she threw in a 
couple of venison steaks we could pick up after the butcher-

ing. even with the money divided in two, neither gale nor i 
had held so much at one time in our lives. we decided to keep 
it a secret and surprise our families with the meat and money 
at the end of the next day. 
this is where i really got the money for the goat, but i tell 
peeta i sold an old silver locket of my motherâ€™s. that canâ€™t hurt 
anyone. then i pick up the story in the late afternoon of primâ€™s

impatient, but the goats are clean and their milk is rich if you 
can afford it. 
one of the goats, a white one with black patches, was lying 
down in a cart. it was easy to see why. something, probably a 
dog, had mauled her shoulder and infection had set in. it was 
bad, the goat man had to hold her up to milk her. but i 
thought i knew someone who could fix it. 
â€œgale,â€ i whispered. â€œi want that goat for prim.â€ 
owning a nanny goat can change your life in district 12. 
the animals can live off almost anything, the meadowâ€™s a per-

to drink, to make into cheese, to sell. itâ€™s not even against the 
law. â€œsheâ€™s hurt pretty bad,â€ said gale. â€œwe better take a closer 
look.â€ we went over and bought a cup of milk to share, then stood 
over the goat as if idly curious.

â€œlet her be,â€ said the man. 
â€œjust looking,â€ said gale. 
â€œwell, look fast. she goes to the butcher soon. hardly any-
one will buy her milk, and then they only pay half price,â€ said 
the man. 
â€œwhatâ€™s the butcher giving for her?â€ i asked. 
the man shrugged. â€œhang around and see.â€ i turned and 
saw rooba coming across the square toward us. â€œlucky thing 
you showed up,â€ said the goat man when she arrived. â€œgirlâ€™s 
got her eye on your goat.â€ 
â€œnot if sheâ€™s spoken for,â€ i said carelessly. 
rooba looked me up and down then f

the goat man was mad, but he still wanted that goal off his 
hands. it took us half an hour to agree on the price. quite a 
crowd had gathered by then to hand out opinions. it was an

people took sides in the argument, but i took the goat. 
gale offered to carry her. i think he wanted to see the look 
on primâ€™s face as much as i did. in a moment of complete gid-
diness, i bought a pink ribbon and tied it around her neck. 
then we hurried back to my house. 
you should have seen primâ€™s reaction when we walked in 
with that goat. remember this is a girl who wept to save that 
awful old cat, buttercup. she was so excited she started crying 
and laughing all at once. my mother was less sure, seeing the 
injury, but the pair of them went

a team, and made good on his promise to keep my sisterâ€™s bel-
ly full. spirits must be running high in district 12. we so rarely 
have anyone to root for at this point in the games. surely, 
people are excited about peeta and me, especially now that 
weâ€™re together. if i close my eyes, i can imagine their shouts at 
the screens, urging us on. i see their faces â€” greasy sac and 
madge and even the peacekeepers who buy my meat cheering 
for us. and gale. i know him. he wonâ€™t be shouting and cheering. 
but heâ€™ll be watching, every moment, every twist and turn, 
and willing me to come home. i wonder if heâ€™s hoping that 
peeta makes it as well. galeâ€™s not my boyfriend, but would he 
be, if i opened that door? he talked about us running away to-
gether. was that just a practical calculation of our chances of 
survival away from the district? or something more? 
i wonder what he makes of all this kissing.

leave when i remember the importance of sustaining the star-

lingering kiss. i imagine the teary sighs emanating from the 
capitol and pretend to brush away a tear of my own. then i 
squeeze through the opening in the rocks out into the night. 
my breath makes small white clouds as it hits the air. itâ€™s as 
cold as a november night at home. one where iâ€™ve slipped into 
the woods, lantern in hand, to join gale at some prearranged 
place where weâ€™ll sit bundled together, sipping herb tea from 
metal flasks wrapped in quilting, hoping game will pass our 
way as the morning comes on. oh, gale, i think. if only you had

â€œno. nobody really wanted to track thresh down in that 
grass. it has a sinister feeling to it. every time i look at that 
field, all i can think of are hidden things. snakes, and rabid an-
imals, and quicksand,â€ peeta says. â€œthere could be anything in 
there.â€

i donâ€™t say so but peetaâ€™s words remind me of the warnings 
they give us about not going beyond the fence in district 12. i 
canâ€™t help, for a moment, comparing him with gale, who 
would see that field as a potential source of food as well as a 
threat. thresh certainly did. itâ€™s not that peetaâ€™s soft exactly, 
and heâ€™s proved heâ€™s not a coward. but there are things you 
donâ€™t question too much, i guess, when your home always 
smells like baking bread, whereas gale questions everything. 
what would peeta think of the irreverent banter that passes 
between us as we break the law each day? would it shock 
him? the things we say about panem? galeâ€™s tirades

somewhere during my shift, the rain stops not gradually 
but all at once. the downpour ends and thereâ€™s only the resi-
dual drippings of water from branches, the rush of the now 
overflowing stream below us. a full, beautiful moon emerges, 
and even without the glasses i can see outside. i canâ€™t decide if 
the moon is real or merely a projection of the gamemakers. i 
know it was full shortly before i left home. gale and i watched 
it rise as we hunted into the late hours. 
how long have i been gone? iâ€™m guessing itâ€™s been about 
two weeks in the arena, and there was that week of prepara-
tion in the capitol. maybe the moon has completed its cycle. 
for some reason, i badly want it to be my moon, the same one 
i see from the woods around district 12. that would give me 
something to cling to in the surreal world of the arena where 
the authenticity of everything is to be doubted.

so, we start up again and heâ€™s a tiny bit better, but even

â€œcan you take your boots off?â€ i suggest. 
â€œhere?â€ he asks in disbelief, as if iâ€™d asked him to walk bare-
foot on hot coals or something. i have to remind myself that 
heâ€™s still not used to the woods, that itâ€™s the scary, forbidden 
place beyond the fences of district 12. i think of gale, with his 
velvet tread. itâ€™s eerie how little sound he makes, even when

back together again. somewhere, cinna and portia will be 
creating our wardrobes for the public appearances. haymitch 
and effie will be arranging the banquet for our sponsors, re-
viewing the questions for our final interviews. back home, 
district 12 is probably in chaos as they try and organize the 
homecoming celebrations for peeta and me, given that the last 
one was close to thirty years ago. 
home! prim and my mother! gale! even the thought of 
primâ€™s scruffy old cat makes me smile. soon i will be home! 
i want to get out of this bed. to see peeta and cinna, to find

to gather a bunch of wildflowers for me. when he presents

away with it up to this point because of the games. but there 
will be no games to hide behind back home.

his room for the night. i donâ€™t see him the next morning, ei-
ther. in fact, the next time he turns up, weâ€™re pulling into dis-
trict 12. he gives me a nod, his face expressionless. 
i want to tell him that heâ€™s not being fair. that we were 
strangers. that i did what it took to stay alive, to keep us both 
alive in the arena. that i canâ€™t explain how things are with 
gale because i donâ€™t know myself. that itâ€™s no good loving me 
because iâ€™m never going to get married anyway and heâ€™d just 
end up hating me later instead of sooner. that if i do have feel-
ings for him, it doesnâ€™t matter because iâ€™ll never be able to af-
ford the kind of love that leads to a family, to children. and 
how can he? how can he after what weâ€™ve just been through? 
i also want to tell him how much i already miss him. but 
that wouldnâ€™t be fair on my part.
