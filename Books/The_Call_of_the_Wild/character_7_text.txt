 there were official orders.
fresh batches of hudson bay dogs were to take the places of those
worthless for the trail. the worthless ones were to be got rid of, and,
since dogs count for little against dollars, they were to be sold.

three days passed, by which time buck and his mates found how really
tired and weak they were. then, on the morning of the fourth day, two
men from the states came along and bought them, harness and all, for a
song. the men addressed each other as “hal” and “charles.” charles was
a middle-aged, lightish-colored man, with weak and watery eyes and a
mustache that twisted fiercely and vigorously up, giving the lie to the
limply drooping lip it concealed. hal was a youngster of nineteen or
twenty, with a big colt’s revolver and a hunting-knife strapped about
him on a belt that fairly bristled with cartridges. this belt was the
most salient thing about him. it advertised his callowness--a callowness
sheer and unutterable. both men were manifestly out of pla

 passes understanding.

buck heard the chaffering, saw the money pass between the man and the
government agent, and knew that the scotch half-breed and the mail-train
drivers were passing out of his life on the heels of perrault and
francois and the others who had gone before. when driven with his mates
to the new owners’ camp, buck saw a slipshod and slovenly affair, tent
half stretched, dishes unwashed, everything in disorder; also, he saw a
woman. “mercedes” the men called her. she was charles’s wife and hal’s
sister--a nice family party.

buck watched them apprehensively as they proceeded to take down the tent
and load the sled. there was a great deal of effort about their manner,
but no businesslike method. the tent was rolled into an awkward bundle
three times as large as it should have been. the tin dishes were packed
away unwashed. mercedes continually fluttered in the way of her men and
kept up an unbroken chattering of remonstrance and advice. when they put
a clothes-sack

ing tent came out and looked on, grinning and
winking at one another.

“you’ve got a right smart load as it is,” said one of them; “and it’s
not me should tell you your business, but i wouldn’t tote that tent
along if i was you.”

“undreamed of!” cried mercedes, throwing up her hands in dainty dismay.
“however in the world could i manage without a tent?”

“it’s springtime, and you won’t get any more cold weather,” the man
replied.

she shook her head decidedly, and charles and hal put the last odds and
ends on top the mountainous load.

“think it’ll ride?” one of the men asked.

“why shouldn’t it?” charles demanded rather shortly.

“oh, that’s all right, that’s all right,” the man hastened meekly to
say. “i was just a-wonderin’, that is all. it seemed a mite top-heavy.”

charles turned his back and drew the lashings down as well as he could,
which was not in the least well.

“an’ of course the dogs can hike along all day with that co

dishes,--who’s going to wash them, anyway? good lord, do you think
you’re travelling on a pullman?”

and so it went, the inexorable elimination of the superfluous. mercedes
cried when her clothes-bags were dumped on the ground and article
after article was thrown out. she cried in general, and she cried in
particular over each discarded thing. she clasped hands about knees,
rocking back and forth broken-heartedly. she averred she would not go
an inch, not for a dozen charleses. she appealed to everybody and to
everything, finally wiping her eyes and proceeding to cast out even
articles of apparel that were imperative necessaries. and in her zeal,
when she had finished with her own, she attacked the belongings of her
men and went through them like a tornado.

this accomplished, the outfit, though cut in half, was still a
formidable bulk. charles and hal went out in the evening and bought six
outside dogs. these, added to the six of the original team, and teek

es of continuous trail, the outlook was anything
but bright. the two men, however, were quite cheerful. and they were
proud, too. they were doing the thing in style, with fourteen dogs. they
had seen other sleds depart over the pass for dawson, or come in from
dawson, but never had they seen a sled with so many as fourteen dogs. in
the nature of arctic travel there was a reason why fourteen dogs should
not drag one sled, and that was that one sled could not carry the food
for fourteen dogs. but charles and hal did not know this. they had
worked the trip out with a pencil, so much to a dog, so many dogs,
so many days, q.e.d. mercedes looked over their shoulders and nodded
comprehensively, it was all so very simple.

late next morning buck led the long team up the street. there was
nothing lively about it, no snap or go in him and his fellows. they were
starting dead weary. four times he had covered the distance between salt
water and dawson, and the knowledge that, jaded and tired, he was faci

t of their misery, increased with it, doubled
upon it, outdistanced it. the wonderful patience of the trail which
comes to men who toil hard and suffer sore, and remain sweet of speech
and kindly, did not come to these two men and the woman. they had no
inkling of such a patience. they were stiff and in pain; their muscles
ached, their bones ached, their very hearts ached; and because of this
they became sharp of speech, and hard words were first on their lips in
the morning and last at night.

charles and hal wrangled whenever mercedes gave them a chance. it was
the cherished belief of each that he did more than his share of the
work, and neither forbore to speak this belief at every opportunity.
sometimes mercedes sided with her husband, sometimes with her brother.
the result was a beautiful and unending family quarrel. starting from
a dispute as to which should chop a few sticks for the fire (a dispute
which concerned only charles and hal), presently would be lugged in the
rest of the fami

ly, fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins, people thousands
of miles away, and some of them dead. that hal’s views on art, or the
sort of society plays his mother’s brother wrote, should have
anything to do with the chopping of a few sticks of firewood, passes
comprehension; nevertheless the quarrel was as likely to tend in that
direction as in the direction of charles’s political prejudices. and
that charles’s sister’s tale-bearing tongue should be relevant to the
building of a yukon fire, was apparent only to mercedes, who disburdened
herself of copious opinions upon that topic, and incidentally upon a
few other traits unpleasantly peculiar to her husband’s family. in the
meantime the fire remained unbuilt, the camp half pitched, and the dogs
unfed.

mercedes nursed a special grievance--the grievance of sex. she was
pretty and soft, and had been chivalrously treated all her days. but
the pre

ivalrous. it was her custom to be helpless. they complained. upon
which impeachment of what to her was her most essential sex-prerogative,
she made their lives unendurable. she no longer considered the dogs, and
because she was sore and tired, she persisted in riding on the sled. she
was pretty and soft, but she weighed one hundred and twenty pounds--a
lusty last straw to the load dragged by the weak and starving animals.
she rode for days, till they fell in the traces and the sled stood
still. charles and hal begged her to get off and walk, pleaded with her,
entreated, the while she wept and importuned heaven with a recital of
their brutality.

on one occasion they took her off the sled by main strength. they never
did it again. she let her legs go limp like a spoiled child, and sat
down on the trail. they went on their way, but she did not move. after
they had travelled three miles they unloaded the sled, came back for
her, and by main strength put her on the sled again.

aining to break loose the ice that bound it down. it ate away
from beneath; the sun ate from above. air-holes formed, fissures sprang
and spread apart, while thin sections of ice fell through bodily into
the river. and amid all this bursting, rending, throbbing of awakening
life, under the blazing sun and through the soft-sighing breezes, like
wayfarers to death, staggered the two men, the woman, and the huskies.

with the dogs falling, mercedes weeping and riding, hal swearing
innocuously, and charles’s eyes wistfully watering, they staggered into
john thornton’s camp at the mouth of white river. when they halted,
the dogs dropped down as though they had all been struck dead. mercedes
dried her eyes and looked at john thornton. charles sat down on a log
to rest. he sat down very slowly and painstakingly what of his great
stiffness. hal did the talking. john thornton was whittling the last
touches on an axe-handle he had made from a stick of birch. he whittled

rom a great distance, he was
aware that he was being beaten. the last sensations of pain left him. he
no longer felt anything, though very faintly he could hear the impact of
the club upon his body. but it was no longer his body, it seemed so far
away.

and then, suddenly, without warning, uttering a cry that was
inarticulate and more like the cry of an animal, john thornton sprang
upon the man who wielded the club. hal was hurled backward, as
though struck by a falling tree. mercedes screamed. charles looked on
wistfully, wiped his watery eyes, but did not get up because of his
stiffness.

john thornton stood over buck, struggling to control himself, too
convulsed with rage to speak.

“if you strike that dog again, i’ll kill you,” he at last managed to say
in a choking voice.

“it’s my dog,” hal replied, wiping the blood from his mouth as he came
back. “get out of my way, or i’ll fix you. i’m going to dawson.”

thornton stood between him and buck, and evinced no intention

traces.

hal had no fight left in him. besides, his hands were full with his
sister, or his arms, rather; while buck was too near dead to be of
further use in hauling the sled. a few minutes later they pulled out
from the bank and down the river. buck heard them go and raised his head
to see, pike was leading, sol-leks was at the wheel, and between were
joe and teek. they were limping and staggering. mercedes was riding the
loaded sled. hal guided at the gee-pole, and charles stumbled along in
the rear.

as buck watched them, thornton knelt beside him and with rough, kindly
hands searched for broken bones. by the time his search had disclosed
nothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation, the
sled was a quarter of a mile away. dog and man watched it crawling along
over the ice. suddenly, they saw its back end drop down, as into a rut,
and the gee-pole, with hal clinging to it, jerk into the air. mercedes’s
scream came to their ears. they saw ch
