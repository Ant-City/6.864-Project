[CHARACTER]  - 
      antigone's uncle. [CHARACTER] is powerfully built, but a weary and wrinkled man suffering the burdens of rule. a practical man, he firmly distances himself from the tragic aspirations of oedipus and his line. as he tells antigone, his only interest is in political and social order. [CHARACTER] is bound to ideas of good sense, simplicity, and the banal happiness of everyday life.
