[CHARACTER] 
as candide's mentor and a philosopher, [CHARACTER] is responsible
for the novel's most famous idea: that all is for the best in this
"best of all possible worlds." this optimistic sentiment is the
main target of voltaire's satire. [CHARACTER]'s philosophy parodies
the ideas of the enlightenment thinker g. w. von leibniz. leibniz
maintains that an all-good, all-powerful god had created the world
and that, therefore, the world must be perfect. when human beings
perceive something as wrong or evil, it is merely because they do
not understand the ultimate good that the so-called evil is meant
to serve. like candide, [CHARACTER] is not a believable character;
rather, he is a distorted, exaggerated representation of a certain
kind of philosopher whose personality is inseparable from his philosophy.
	voltaire illustrates two major problems inherent in [CHARACTER]'s philosophy.
first, his philosophy flies in the face of overwhelming evidence
from the real world. [CHARACTER] is ravaged by syphilis, nearly hanged,
nearly dissected, and imprisoned, yet he continues to espouse optimism.
he maintains his optimistic philosophy even at the end
of the novel, when he himself admits that he has trouble believing
in it. voltaire advocates the induction of ideas from concrete evidence;
[CHARACTER], in contrast, willfully ignores any evidence that contradicts
his initial opinion. he also produces illogical arguments to support
his preconceived notions, justifying the consumption of pork by
saying that "since pigs were made to be eaten, we eat pork all year
round."
	second, [CHARACTER]'s philosophy encourages a
passive and complacent attitude toward all that is wrong in the
world. if this world is the best one possible, than there is no
reason to make any effort to change things perceived as evil or
wrong. therefore, when [CHARACTER]'s benefactor jacques is drowning
in the bay of lisbon, [CHARACTER] prevents candide from trying to rescue
him by "proving that the bay of lisbon had been formed expressly
for [jacques] to drown in." the consequence of this mode of thinking
is that, "while [[CHARACTER]] was proving the point a priori, the vessel
opened up and everyone perished."
