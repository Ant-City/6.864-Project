"mitterrand was a bold man," langdon replied, splitting the difference. the late french president
who had commissioned the pyramid was said to have suffered from a "pharaoh complex."
singlehandedly responsible for filling paris with egyptian obelisks, art, and artifacts.

francois mitterrand had an affinity for egyptian culture that was so all-consuming that the french
still referred to him as the sphinx.

"what is the captain's name?" langdon asked, changing topics.



"bezu fache," the driver said, approaching the pyramid's main entrance. "we call him le taureau. "

langdon glanced over at him, wondering if every frenchman had a mysterious animal epithet.
"you call your captain the bull?"

the man arched his eyebrows. "your french is better than you admit, monsieur langdon."

my french stinks, langdon thought, but my zodiac iconography is pretty good. taurus was always
the bull. astrology was a symbolic constant all over the world.

 knocked on the front door of
a pyramid and expected an answer. he raised his hand to bang on the glass, but out of the darkness
below, a figure appeared, striding up the curving staircase. the man was stocky and dark, almost
neanderthal, dressed in a dark double-breasted suit that strained to cover his wide shoulders. he
advanced with unmistakable authority on squat, powerful legs. he was speaking on his cell phone
but finished the call as he arrived. he motioned for langdon to enter.



"i am bezu fache," he announced as langdon pushed through the revolving door. "captain of the
central directorate judicial police." his tone was fitting — a guttural rumble... like a gathering
storm.

langdon held out his hand to shake. "robert langdon."

fache's enormous palm wrapped around langdon's with crushing force.

"i saw the photo," langdon said. "your agent said jacques sauniere himself did — "

"mr. langdon," fache's ebony eyes locked on. "what you see in the photo is only the beginning of

chapter 4

captain bezu fache carried himself like an angry ox, with his wide shoulders thrown back and his
chin tucked hard into his chest. his dark hair was slicked back with oil, accentuating an arrow-like
widow's peak that divided his jutting brow and preceded him like the prow of a battleship. as he
advanced, his dark eyes seemed to scorch the earth before him, radiating a fiery clarity that forecast
his reputation for unblinking severity in all matters.

langdon followed the captain down the famous marble staircase in

mistakes tonight.

and so far, no mistakes had been made.

collet was not yet privy to the evidence that had cemented fache's certainty of their suspect's guilt,
but he knew better than to question the instincts of the bull. fache's intuition seemed almost
supernatural at times. god whispers in his ear, one agent had insisted after a particularly
impressive display of fache's sixth sense. collet had to admit, if there was a god, bezu fache
would be on his a-list. the captain attended mass and confession with zealous regularity — far
more than the requisite holiday attendance fulfilled by other officials in the name of good public



relations. when the pope visited paris a few years back, fache had used all his muscle to obtain the
honor of an audience. a photo of fache with the pope now hung in his office. the papal bull, the
agents secretly called it.

collet found it ironic that one of fache's rare popular public stances in

fache was keeping his prey on a very tight leash tonight. wisely so. robert langdon had proven
himself one cool customer.



chapter 9

to ensure his conversation with mr. langdon would not be interrupted, bezu fache had turned off
his cellular phone. unfortunately, it was an expensive model equipped with a two-way radio
feature, which, contrary to his orders, was now being used by one of his agents to page him.

"capitaine?" the phone crackled like a walkie-talkie.

fache felt his teeth clench in rage. he could imagine nothing important enough that collet would
interrupt this surveillance cachee — especially at this critical juncture.

he gave langdon a calm look of apology. "one moment please." he pulle

rated the veteran french
cryptographers above her. and by far the most troubling to fache was the inescapable universal
truth that in an office of middle-aged men, an attractive young woman always drew eyes away
from the work at hand.

the man on the radio said, "agent neveu insisted on speaking to you immediately, captain. i tried
to stop her, but she's on her way into the gallery. "

fache recoiled in disbelief. "unacceptable! i made it very clear — "



for a moment, robert langdon thought bezu fache was suffering a stroke. the captain was mid-
sentence when his jaw stopped moving and his eyes bulged. his blistering gaze seemed fixated on
something over langdon's shoulder. before langdon could turn to see what it was, he heard a
woman's voice chime out behind him.

"excusez-moi, messieurs. "

langdon turned to see a young woman approaching. she was moving down the corridor toward
them with long, fluid strides... a haunting certainty to her gait. dressed casually in a knee-length,

the bishop smiled. "a fine point. our desires are in accord. godspeed."

approximately the same number of u.s. dollars. a pittance for something so powerful.

he felt a renewed confidence that the teacher and silas would not fail. money and faith were



powerful motivators.



chapter 11

"une plaisanterie numerique?" bezu fache was livid, glaring at sophie neveu in disbelief. a
numeric joke? "your professional assessment of sauniere's code is that it is some kind of
mathematical prank?"

fache was in utter incomprehension of this woman's gall. not only had she just barged in on fache
without permission, but she was now trying to convince him that sauniere, in his final moments of
life, had been inspired to leave a mathematical gag?

"this code," sophie explained in rapid french, "is simplistic to the point of absurdit

just redefined le suicide professionnel.

fache turned to langdon, who was still on the phone, looking more concerned than before,
listening intently to his phone message. the u.s. embassy. bezu fache despised many things... but
few drew more wrath than the u.s. embassy.

fache and the ambassador locked horns regularly over shared affairs of state — their most common
battleground being law enforcement for visiting americans. almost daily, dcpj arrested american
exchange students in possession of drugs, u.s. businessmen for soliciting underage prostitutes,
american tourists for shoplifting or destruction of property. legally, the u.s. embassy could
intervene and extradite guilty citizens ba

grandfather's message be? sophie needed more time with langdon. time to think. time to sort out
this mystery together. unfortunately, time was running out.

gazing up at langdon, sophie made the only play she could think of. "bezu fache will be taking
you into custody at any minute. i can get you out of this museum. but we need to act now."

langdon's eyes went wide. "you want me to run?"

"it's the smartest thing you could do. if you let fache take you into custody now, you'll spend
weeks in a french jail while dcpj and the u.s. embassy fight over which courts try your case. but

urriedly, "i need to ask you one last question." and your entire future
may depend on it. "the writing on the floor is obviously not proof of your guilt, and yet fache told



our team he is certain you are his man. can you think of any other reason he might be convinced
you're guilty?"

langdon was silent for several seconds. "none whatsoever."

sophie sighed. which means fache is lying. why, sophie could not begin to imagine, but that was
hardly the issue at this point. the fact remained that bezu fache was determined to put robert
langdon behind bars tonight, at any cost. sophie needed langdon for herself, and it was this
dilemma that left sophie only one logical conclusion.

/ need to get langdon to the u.s. embassy.

turning toward the window, sophie gazed through the alarm mesh embedded in the plate glass,
down the dizzying forty feet to the pavement below. a leap from this height would leave langdon
with a couple of broken legs. at best.

nonetheless, sophie made her decision.

the operator paused, confused. "i'm sorry, sir. your message must be quite old. that system was

who told you we had a message for you?"

"you have no automated phone system?"

"no, sir. any message for you would be handwritten in our services department. what was your
name again?"

but the man had hung up.



bezu fache felt dumbstruck as he paced the banks of the seine. he was certain he had seen
langdon dial a local number, enter a three-digit code, and then listen to a recording. but if langdon
didn't phone the embassy, then who the hell did he call?

it was at that moment, eyeing his cellular phone, that fache realized the answers were in the palm
of his hand. langdon used my phone to place that call.

keying into the cell phone's menu, fache pulled up the list of recently dialed numbers and found

grouard wanted nothing more than to pull the trigger and bury a bullet in robert langdon's back.

reminded himself, however, that killing langdon would be a generous fate compared to the misery

outside the salle des etats, bezu fache was fuming as louvre warden grouard explained how

frowning, she replaced it in the rosewood box and closed the lid. looking outside at langdon,
sophie felt grateful he was with her tonight. p.s. find robert langdon. her grandfather's rationale
for including him was now clear. sophie was not equipped to understand her grandfather's
intentions, and so he had assigned robert langdon as her guide. a tutor to oversee her education.
unfortunately for langdon, he had turned out to be far more than a tutor tonight. he had become
the target of bezu fache... and some unseen force intent on possessing the holy grail.

whatever the grail turns out to be.

sophie wondered if finding out was worth her life.



as the armored truck accelerated again, langdon was pleased how much more smoothly it drove.
"do you know how to get to versailles?"

sophie eyed him. "sightseeing?"

"no, i have a plan. there's a religious historian i know who lives near versailles. i can't remember
exactly where, but we can look it up. i've been to his estate a few times. hi

"and not to turn us in."

"i don't intend to tell him we're wanted by the police. i'm hoping he'll take us in until we can sort
all this out."

"robert, has it occurred to you that every television in france is probably getting ready to
broadcast our pictures? bezu fache always uses the media to his advantage. he'll make it
impossible for us to move around without being recognized."



terrific, langdon thought. my french tv debut will be on "paris 's most wanted. " at least jonas
faukman would be pleased; every time langdon made the news, his book sales jumped.

"is this man a good enough friend?" sophie asked.

langdon doubted teabing was someone who watched television, especially at this hour, but still
the question deserved consideration. instinct told lang

as he stood there, collet flashed on a second possible explanation for this delay. damage control.
in law enforcement, hesitating to arrest a fugitive only occurred when uncertainty had arisen
regarding the suspect's guilt. is fache having second thoughts that langdon is the right man ? the
thought was frightening. captain fache had gone out on a limb tonight to arrest robert
langdon — surveillance cachee, interpol, and now television. not even the great bezu fache would
survive the political fallout if he had mistakenly splashed a prominent american's face all over
french television, claiming he was a murderer. if fache now realized he'd made a mistake, then it
made perfect sense that he would tell collet not to make a move. the last thing fache needed was
for collet to storm an innocent brit's private estate and take langdon at gunpoint.

moreover, collet realized, if langdon were innocent, it explained one of this case's strangest
paradoxes: why had so

alone in the small cabin, aringarosa twisted the gold ring on his finger and tried to ease his
overwhelming sense of fear and desperation. everything in paris has gone terribly wrong. closing
his eyes, aringarosa said a prayer that bezu fache would have the means to fix it.

rose. tonight has become the strangest and most magical night of my life.



"lift the lid," sophie whispered, standing over him, beside langdon.

wanted to savor every millisecond of this moment. he ran a palm across the wooden lid, feeling the

opus dei character found you. from all you've told me, i can't imagine how this man could have
tailed you to my home unless he had a contact either within the judicial police or within the zurich

langdon considered it. bezu fache certainly seemed intent on finding a scapegoat for tonight's
murders. and vernet had turned on them rather suddenly, although considering langdon was
being charged with four murders, the banker's change of heart seemed understandable.

"this monk is not working alone, robert," teabing said, "and until you learn who is behind all this,
you both are in danger. the good news, my friend, is that you are now in the position of power.

bourget airfield's night shift air traffic controller had been dozing before a blank radar screen
when the captain of the judicial police practically broke down his door.

"teabing's jet," bezu fache blared, marching into the small tower, "where did it go?"

the controller's initial response was a babbling, lame attempt to protect the privacy of their british
client — one of the airfield's most respected customers. it failed miserably.

"okay," fache said, "i am placing you under arrest for permitting a private plane to take off
without registering a flight plan. " fache motioned to another officer, who approached with
handcuffs, and the traffic controller felt a surge of terror. he thoug

"go ahead," teabing said without breaking stride or glancing back. "my lawyers will fricassee
your testicles for breakfast. and if you dare board my plane without a warrant, your spleen will
follow."



no stranger to power plays, the chief inspector was unimpressed. technically, teabing was correct
and the police needed a warrant to board his jet, but because the flight had originated in france,
and because the powerful bezu fache had given his authority, the kent chief inspector felt certain
his career would be far better served by finding out what it was on this plane that teabing seemed
so intent on hiding.

"stop them," the inspector ordered. "i'm searching the plane."

his men raced over, guns leveled, and physically blocked teabing and his servant from reaching
the limousine.

plane. you will regret it."

with the exception of the frightened-looking pilot in the cockpit, the aircraft was empty. entirely
devoid of human life. quickly checking the bathroom, the chairs, and the luggage areas, the
inspector found no traces of anyone hiding... much less multiple individuals.

langdon is innocent. all charges against him have been dropped. even so, both of you are in

pulling slowly on the ends, fache slid off one of the end caps. the cylinder was empty.

as the sound of heavy footsteps thundered down the hall toward the chapter house, langdon
quietly rolled the papyrus and slipped it back in his pocket.

when the doors burst open, bezu fache entered like a bull into a ring, his feral eyes scanning,
finding his target — leigh teabing — helpless on the floor. exhaling in relief, fache holstered his
