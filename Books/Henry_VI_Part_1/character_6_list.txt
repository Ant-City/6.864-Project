Joan - 
      Also known as Joan la Pucelle or Joan of Arc, Joan is a French maiden who comes to Charles with reports of her visions of the future of France. She says she will lead his troops in breaking the Britons' siege on Orleans, and her words prove true. Thereafter she aids the French troops in several battles. Before a battle with York and Somerset, she calls to her demons for advice but they refuse to speak to her. Then she is captured by York and put on trial. She tries to save herself by claiming she is a virgin, then saying she is pregnant, but the British burn her at the stake.
