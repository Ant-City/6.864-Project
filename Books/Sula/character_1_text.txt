the beech, she lifted him to the first branch, saying,
"go on. go on. i got you." she followed the boy, steadying
him, when he needed it, with her hand and her reassuring
voice. when they were as high as they could go, sula
pointed to the far side of the river. "see? bet you never saw
that far before, did you?" "uh uh." "now look down there."
they both leaned a little and peered through the leaves at
nel standing below, squinting up at them. from their height
she looked small and foreshortened. chicken little
laughed. "y'all better come on down before you break your
neck," nel hollered. "i ain't never coming down," the boy
hollered back. "yeah. we better. come on, chicken."
"naw. lemme go." "yeah, chicken. come on, now." sula
pulled his leg gently. "lemme go." "ok, i'm leavin' you."
she started on. "wait!" he screamed. sula stopped and
together they slowly worked their way down. chicken was
still elated. "iwas way up there, wasn't i? wasn't i? i'm a tell
my brovver." sula and nel began to mimic him:

 "i'm a tell
my brovver; i'm a tell my brovver." sula picked him up by his
hands and swung him outward then around and around. his
knickers ballooned and his shrieks of frightened joy startled
the birds and the fat grasshoppers. when he slipped from
her hands and sailed away out over the water they could
still hear his bubbly laughter. the water darkened and
closed quickly over the place where chicken little sank.
the pressure of his hard and tight little fingers was still in
sula's palms as she stood looking at the closed place in
the water. they expected him to come back up, laughing.
both girls stared at the water. nel spoke first. "somebody
saw." a figure appeared briefly on the opposite shore. the
only house over there was shadrack's. sula glanced at nel.
terror widened her nostrils. had he seen? the water was
so peaceful now. there was nothing but the baking sun and
something newly missing. s

ck in some rocks and weeds, his knickers
ballooning about his legs. he would have left him there but
noticed that it was a child, not an old black man, as it first
appeared, and he prodded the body loose, netted it and
hauled it aboard. he shook his head in disgust at the kind
of parents who would drown their own children. when, he
wondered, will those people ever be anything but animals,
fit for nothing but substitutes for mules, only mules didn't kill
each other the way niggers did. he dumped chicken little
into a burlap sack and tossed him next to some egg crates
and boxes of wool cloth. later, sitting down to smoke on an
empty lard tin, still bemused bygod's curse and the terrible
burden his own kind had of elevating ham's sons, he
suddenly became alarmed by the thought that the corpse in
this heat would have a terrible odor, which might get into
the fabric of his woolen cloth. he dragged the sack away
and hooked it over the side, so that the chicken's body was
half in and half out of the water.

ed his find to the sheriff at porter's landing,
who said they didn't have no niggers in their county, but that
some lived in those hills 'cross the river, up above
medallion. the bargeman said he couldn't go all the way
back there, it was every bit of two miles. the sheriff said
whyn't he throw it on back into the water. the bargeman
said he never shoulda taken it out in the first place. finally
they got the man who ran the ferry twice a day to agree to
take it over in the morning. that was why chicken little was
missing for three days and didn't get to the embalmer's until
the fourth day, by which time he was unrecognizable to
almost everybody who once knew him, and even his mother
wasn't deep down sure, except that it just had to be him
since nobody could find him. when she saw his clothes
lying on the table in the basement of the mortuary, her
mouth snapped shut, and when she saw his body her mouth
flew wide open again and it was seven hours before she
was able to close it and make the first soun

it. then they left their pews. for with some emotions one
has to stand. they spoke, for they were full and needed to
say. they swayed, for the rivulets of grief or of ecstasy must
be rocked. and when they thought of all that life and death
locked into that little closed coffin they danced and
screamed, not to protest god's will but to acknowledge it
and confirm once more their conviction that the only way to
avoid the hand of god is to get in it. in the colored part of
the cemetery, they sank chicken little in between his
grandfather and an aunt. butterflies flew in and out of the
bunches of field flowers now loosened from the top of the
bier and lying in a small heap at the edge of the grave. the
heat had gone, but there was still no breeze to lift the hair of
the willows. nel and sula stood some distance away from
the grave, the space that had sat between them in the pews
had dissolved. they held hands and knew that only the
coffin would lie in the earth; the bubbly laughter and the
press of fin

too dark. the bathroom. it was both small and bright, and
she wanted to be in a very small, very bright place. small
enough to contain her grief. bright enough to throw into
relief the dark things that cluttered her. once inside, she
sank to the tile floor next to the toilet. on her knees, her
hand on the cold rim of the bathtub, she waited for
something to happen... inside. there was stirring, a
movement of mud and dead leaves. she thought of the
women at chicken little's funeral. the women who
shrieked over the bier and at the lip of the open grave.
what she had regarded since as unbecoming behavior
seemed fitting to her now; they were screaming at the neck
of god, his giant nape, the vast back-of-the-head that he
had turned on them in death. but it seemed to her now that
it was not a fist-shaking grief they were keening but rather a
simple obligation to say something, do something, feel
something about the dead. they could not let that heartsmashing

hurriedly down the hall, eva calling after her, "sula?" nel
couldn't see the other women today. that woman had upset
her. she handed her pass back to the lady, avoiding her
look of surprise. outside she fastened her coat against the
rising wind. the top button was missing so she covered her
throat with her hand. a bright space opened in her head
and memory seeped into it. standing on the riverbank in a
purple-and-white dress, sula swinging chicken little
around and around. his laughter before the hand-slip and
the water closing quickly over the place. what had she felt
then, watching sula going around and around and then the
little boy swinging out over the water? sula had cried and
cried when she came back from shadrack's house. but nel
had remained calm. _"shouldn't we tell?"__ _"did he
see?"__ _"i don't know. no."__ _"let's go. we can't bring
him back."__ what did old eva mean by _you watched?__

 hands slipped. she hadn't
wondered about that in years. "why didn't i feel bad when it
happened? how come it felt so good to see him fall?" all
these years she had been secretly proud of her calm,
controlled behavior when sula was uncontrollable, her
compassion for sula's frightened and shamed eyes. now it
seemed that what she had thought was maturity, serenity
and compassion was only the tranquillity that follows a joyful
stimulation. just as the water closed peacefully over the
turbulence of chicken little's body, so had contentment
washed over her enjoyment. she was walking too fast. not
watching where she placed her feet, she got into the weeds
by the side of the road. running almost, she approached
beechnut park. just over there was the colored part of the
cemetery. she went in. sula was buried there along with
plum, hannah and now pearl. with the same disregard for
name changes by marriage that the black people of
medallion always showed, each flat slab had one word
carved on it. together the

could not hold. now, however, after the way eva had just
treated her, accused her, she wondered if the townspeople

that made every gesture an offense, every off-center smile
a threat, so that even the bubbles of relief that broke in the
chest of practically everybody when sula died did not
soften their spite and allow them to go to mr. hodges'
funeral parlor or send flowers from the church or bake a
yellow cake. she thought about nathan opening the
bedroom door the day she had visited her, and finding the
body. he said he knew she was dead right a
