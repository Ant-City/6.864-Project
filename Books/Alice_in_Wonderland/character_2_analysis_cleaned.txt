the [CHARACTER]
as the ruler of wonderland, the [CHARACTER] is the
character that alice must inevitably face to figure out the puzzle
of wonderland. in a sense, the [CHARACTER] is literally the
heart of alice's conflict. unlike many of the other characters in
wonderland, the [CHARACTER] is not as concerned with nonsense
and perversions of logic as she is with absolute rule and execution.
in wonderland, she is a singular force of fear who even dominates
the king of hearts. in the queen's presence, alice finally gets
a taste of true fear, even though she understands that the queen
of hearts is merely a playing card. the gryphon later informs alice
that the queen never actually executes anyone she sentences to death,
which reinforces the fact that the [CHARACTER]'s power lies
in her rhetoric. the queen becomes representative of the idea that
wonderland is devoid of substance.
