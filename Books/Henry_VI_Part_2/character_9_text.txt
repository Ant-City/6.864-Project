and william de la pole first duke of suffolke.
this was my dreame, what it doth bode god knowes

   eli. tut, this was nothing but an argument,
that he that breakes a sticke of glosters groue,
shall loose his head for his presumption.
but list to me my humfrey, my sweete duke:

presumptuous dame, ill-nurter'd elianor,

and wilt thou still be hammering treachery,
to tumble downe thy husband, and thy selfe,
from top of honor, to disgraces feete?
away from me, and let me heare no more

god and king henry gouerne englands realme:
giue vp your staffe, sir, and the king his realme

   glost. my staffe? here, noble henry, is my staffe:
as willingly doe i the same resigne,
as ere thy father henry made it mine;
and euen as willingly at thy feete i leaue it,
as others would ambitiously receiue it.
farewell good king: when i am dead, and gone,
may honorable peace attend thy throne.

exit gloster.

  queene. why now is henry king, and margaret queen,
and humfrey, duke of gloster, scarce himselfe,
that beares so shrewd a mayme: two pulls at once;
his lady banisht, and a limbe lopt off.
this staffe of honor raught, there let it stand,
where it best fits to be, in henries hand

   glost. ah, thus king henry throwes away his crutch,
before his legges be firme to beare his body.
thus is the shepheard beaten from thy side,
and wolues are gnarling, who shall gnaw thee first.
ah that my feare were false, ah that it were;
for good king henry, thy decay i feare.

whose floud begins to flowe within mine eyes;
my body round engyrt with miserie:
for what's more miserable then discontent?
ah vnckle humfrey, in thy face i see
the map of honor, truth, and loyaltie:
and yet, good humfrey, is the houre to come,
that ere i prou'd thee false, or fear'd thy faith.
what lowring starre now enuies thy estate?
that these great lords, and margaret our queene,
doe seeke subuersion of thy harmelesse life.

   suf. the honourable blood of lancaster
must not be shed by such a iaded groome:
hast thou not kist thy hand, and held my stirrop?
bare-headed plodded by my foot-cloth mule,
and thought thee happy when i shooke my head.
how often hast thou waited at my cup,
fed from my trencher, kneel'd downe at the boord,
when i haue feasted with queene margaret?
remember it, and let it make thee crest-falne,
i, and alay this thy abortiue pride:
how in our voyding lobby hast thou stood,
