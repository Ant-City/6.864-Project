cern; regent i am of france.
    give me my steeled coat; i'll fight for france.
    away with these disgraceful wailing robes!
    wounds will i lend the french instead of eyes,
    to weep their intermissive miseries.

                   enter a second messenger

  second messenger. lords, view these letters full of bad
    mischance.
    france is revolted from the english quite,
    except some petty towns of no import.
    the dauphin charles is crowned king in rheims;
    the bastard of orleans with him is join'd;
    reignier, duke of anjou, doth take his part;
    the duke of alencon flieth to his side.
  exeter. the dauphin crowned king! all fly to him!
    o, whither shall we fly from this reproach?
  gloucester. we will not fly but to our enemies' throats.
    bedford, if thou be slack i'll fight it out.
  bedford. gloucester, why doubt'st thou of my forwardness?
    an army have i muster'd in my thoughts,
    wherewith already france is overrun.

acity?
  charles. let's leave this town; for they are hare-brain'd
    slaves,
    and hunger will enforce them to be more eager.
    of old i know them; rather with their teeth
    the walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege.
  reignier. i think by some odd gimmers or device
    their arms are set, like clocks, still to strike on;
    else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.
    by my consent, we'll even let them alone.
  alencon. be it so.

                   enter the bastard of orleans

  bastard. where's the prince dauphin? i have news for him.
  charles. bastard of orleans, thrice welcome to us.
  bastard. methinks your looks are sad, your cheer appall'd.
    hath the late overthrow wrought this offence?
    be not dismay'd, for succour is at hand.
    a holy maid hither with me i bring,
    which, by a vision sent to her from heaven,
    ordained is to raise this tedious siege
    and drive the english forth the bounds of france.
    the spirit of deep prophecy

she hath,
    exceeding the nine sibyls of old rome:
    what's past and what's to come she can descry.
    speak, shall i call her in? believe my words,
    for they are certain and unfallible.
  charles. go, call her in.                       [exit bastard]
    but first, to try her skill,
    reignier, stand thou as dauphin in my place;
    question her proudly; let thy looks be stern;
    by this means shall we sound what skill she hath.

                  re-enter the bastard of orleans with
                          joan la pucelle

  reignier. fair maid, is 't thou wilt do these wondrous feats?
  pucelle. reignier, is 't thou that thinkest to beguile me?
    where is the dauphin? come, come from behind;
    i know thee well, though never seen before.
    be not amaz'd, there's nothing hid from me.
    in private will i talk with thee apart.
    stand back, you lords, and give us leave awhile.
  reignier. she takes upon her bravely at first dash.
  pucelle. dauphin
