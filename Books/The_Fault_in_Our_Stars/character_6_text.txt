ld attend a weekly support group.

this support group featured a rotating cast of charac-
ters in various states of tumor-driven unwellness. why did
the cast rotate? a side effect of dying.

the support group, of course, was depressing as hell.
it met every wednesday in the basement of a stone-walled
episcopal church shaped like a cross. we all sat in a circle
right in the middle of the cross, where the two boards would
have met, where the heart of jesus would have been.

i noticed this because patrick, the support group
leader and only person over eighteen in the room, talked
about the heart of jesus every freaking meeting, all about
how we, as young cancer survivors, were sitting right in
christ's very sacred heart and whatever.

so here's how it went in god's heart: the six or seven or
ten of us walked/wheeled in, grazed at a decrepit selection
of cookies and lemonade, sat down in the circle of trust,
and listened to patrick recount for the thousandth time his
depressingly miserable life s

and you too might be so lucky!

then we introduced ourselves: name. age. diagnosis.
and how we're doing today. i'm hazel, i'd say when they'd
get to me. sixteen. thyroid originally but with an impres-
sive and long-settled satellite colony in my lungs. and i'm
doing okay.

once we got around the circle, patrick always asked if
anyone wanted to share. and then began the circle jerk of
support: everyone talking about fighting and battling and
winning and shrinking and scanning. to be fair to patrick,
he let us talk about dying, too. but most of them weren't
dying. most would live into adulthood, as patrick had.

(which meant there was quite a lot of competitiveness
about it, with everybody wanting to beat not only cancer
itself, but also the other people in the room. like, i realize

 still on me.

it occurred to me why they call it eye contact.

i walked into the circle and sat down next to isaac,
two seats away from the boy. i glanced again. he was still
watching me.

look, let me just say it: he was hot. a nonhot boy
stares at you relentlessly and it is, at best, awkward and, at
worst, a form of assault. but a hot boy . . . well.

i pulled out my phone and clicked it so it would dis-
play the time: 4:59. the circle filled in with the unlucky
twelve-to-eighteens, and then patrick started us out with
the serenity prayer: god, grant me the serenity to accept the things

i cannot change, the courage to change the things i can, and the wis-
dom to know the difference. the guy was still staring at me. i
felt rather blushy.

finally, i decided that the proper strategy was to stare
back. boys do not have a monopoly on the staring business,
after all. so i looked him over as patrick acknowledged for
the thousandth time his ball-lessness etc., and soon it wa

a staring contest. after a while the boy smiled, and then
finally his blue eyes glanced away. when he looked back at
me, i flicked my eyebrows up to say, i win.

he shrugged. patrick continued and then finally it was
time for the introductions. "isaac, perhaps you'd like to go
first today. i know you're facing a challenging time."

"yeah," isaac said. "i'm isaac. i'm seventeen. and it's
looking like i have to get surgery in a couple weeks, after
which i'll be blind. not to complain or anything because i
know a lot of us have it worse, but yeah, i mean, being blind
does sort of suck. my girlfriend helps, though. and friends
like augustus." he nodded toward the boy, who now h

a name. "so, yeah," isaac continued. he was looking at his
hands, which he'd folded into each other like the top of a
tepee. "there's nothing you can do about it."

"we're here for you, isaac," patrick said. "let isaac hear
it, guys." and then we all, in a monotone, said, "we're here
for you, isaac."

michael was next. he was twelve. he had leukemia.

he'd always had leukemia. he was okay. (or so he said. he'd
taken the elevator.)

lida was sixteen, and pretty enough to be the object
of the hot boy's eye. she was a regular— in a long remission
from appendiceal cancer, which i had not previously known
existed. she said— as she had every other time i'd atte

to me as the oxygen-drizzling nubs tickled my nostrils.

there were five others before they got to him. he smiled
a little when his turn came. his voice was low, smoky, and
dead sexy. "my name is augustus waters," he said. "i'm
seventeen. i had a little touch of osteosarcoma a year and a
half ago, but i'm just here today at isaac's request."

"and how are you feeling?" asked patrick.

"oh, i'm grand." augustus waters smiled with a corner
of his mouth. "i'm on a roller coaster that only goes up, my
friend."

when it was my turn, i said, "my name is hazel. i'm

the hour proceeded apace: fights were recounted,
battles won amid wars sure to be lost; hope was clung to;
families were both celebrated and denounced; it was agreed
that friends just didn't get it; tears were shed; comfort
proffered. neither augustus waters nor i spo

patrick said, "augustus, perhaps you'd like to share your
fears with the group."

"my fears?"
"yes."

"i fear oblivion," he said without a moment's pause.
"i fear it like the proverbial blind man who's afraid of the
dark."

"too soon," isaac said, cracking a smile.

"was that insensitive?" augustus asked. "i can be
pretty blind to other people's feelings."

isaac was laughing, but patrick raised a chastening
finger and said, "augustus, please. let's return to you and
your struggles. you said you fear oblivion?"

"i did," augustus answered.

patrick seemed lost. "would, uh, would anyone like to
speak to that?"

i hadn't been in proper school in three years. my
parents were my two best friends. my third best friend was
an author who did not know i existed. i was a fairly shy
person— not the hand-raising type.

and yet, just this once, i decided to speak. i half raised

part of the group.

i looked over at augustus waters, who looked back
at me. you could almost see through his eyes they were
so blue. "there will come a time," i said, "when all of us
are dead. all of us. there will come a time when there are

after i finished, there was quite a long period of silence
as i watched a smile spread all the way across augustus's
face— not the little crooked smile of the boy trying to be
sexy while he stared at me, but his real smile, too big for
his face. "goddamn," augustus said quietly. "aren't you
something else."

neither of us said anything for the rest of support

group. at the end, we all had to hold hands, and patrick led
us in a prayer. "lord jesus christ, we are gathered here in
your heart, literally in your heart, as cancer survivors. you and
you alone know us as we know ourselves. guide us to life
and the light through our times of trial. we pray for isaac's
eyes, for michael's and jamie's blood, for augustus's bones,
for hazel's lungs, for james's throat. we pray that you
might heal us and that we might feel your love, and your
peace, which passes all understanding. and we remember in
our hearts those w

it was a long list. the world contains a lot of dead
people. and while patrick droned on, reading the list from
a sheet of paper because it was too long to memorize, i
kept my eyes closed, trying to think prayerfully but mostly
imagining the day when my name would find its way onto
that list, all the way at the end when everyone had stopped
listening.

when patrick was finished, we said this stupid mantra
together-living our best life today-and it was
over. augustus waters pushed himself out of his chair and
walked over to me. his gait was crooked like his smile. he
