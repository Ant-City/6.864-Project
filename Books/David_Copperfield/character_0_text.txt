indebted to miss betsey for having been born on a friday.

my mother had left her chair in her agitation, and gone behind it in
the corner. miss betsey, looking round the room, slowly and inquiringly,
began on the other side, and carried her eyes on, like a saracen’s head
in a dutch clock, until they reached my mother. then she made a frown
and a gesture to my mother, like one who was accustomed to be obeyed, to
come and open the door. my mother went.

‘mrs. david copperfield, i think,’ said miss betsey; the emphasis
referring, perhaps, to my mother’s mourning weeds, and her condition.

‘yes,’ said my mother, faintly.

‘miss trotwood,’ said the visitor. ‘you have heard of her, i dare say?’

my mother answered she had had that pleasure. and she had a disagreeable
consciousness of not appearing to imply that it had been an overpowering
pleasure.

‘now you see her,’ said miss betsey. my mother bent her head, and begged
her to walk in.

branches, swung like wrecks upon a stormy sea.

‘where are the birds?’ asked miss betsey.

‘the--?’ my mother had been thinking of something else.

‘the rooks--what has become of them?’ asked miss betsey.

‘there have not been any since we have lived here,’ said my mother. ‘we
thought--mr. copperfield thought--it was quite a large rookery; but
the nests were very old ones, and the birds have deserted them a long
while.’

‘david copperfield all over!’ cried miss betsey. ‘david copperfield from
head to foot! calls a house a rookery when there’s not a rook near it,
and takes the birds on trust, because he sees the nests!’

‘mr. copperfield,’ returned my mother, ‘is dead, and if you dare to
speak unkindly of him to me--’

my poor dear mother, i suppose, had some momentary intention of
committing an assault and battery upon my aunt, who could easily have
settled her with one hand, even if my mother had been in

instead, and i am on my journey. the coach jolts, i wake with a start,
and the flute has come back again, and the master at salem house is
sitting with his legs crossed, playing it dolefully, while the old woman
of the house looks on delighted. she fades in her turn, and he fades,

i dreamed, i thought, that once while he was blowing into this dismal
flute, the old woman of the house, who had gone nearer and nearer to him
in her ecstatic admiration, leaned over the back of his chair and gave
him an affectionate squeeze round the neck, which stopped his playing
for a moment. i was in the middle state between sleeping and waking,

fact that he had stopped playing--

about the place; i see the hoar frost, ghostly, through it; i feel my
rimy hair fall clammy on my cheek; i look along the dim perspective of
the schoolroom, with a sputtering candle here and there to light up the
foggy morning, and the breath of the boys wreathing and smoking in the
raw cold as they blow upon their fingers, and tap their feet upon the
floor. it was after breakfast, and we had been summoned in from the
playground, when mr. sharp entered and said:

‘david copperfield is to go into the parlour.’

i expected a hamper from peggotty, and brightened at the order. some
of the boys about me put in their claim not to be forgotten in the
distribution of the good things, as i got out of my seat with great
alacrity.

‘don’t hurry, david,’ said mr. sharp. ‘there’s time enough, my boy,
don’t hurry.’

i might have been surprised by the feeling tone in which he spoke, if i
had given it a thought; but i gave it none until afterwards. i hurried

breakfast with the cane and a newspaper before him, and mrs. creakle
with an opened letter in her hand. but no hamper.

‘david copperfield,’ said mrs. creakle, leading me to a sofa, and
sitting down beside me. ‘i want to speak to you very particularly. i
have something to tell you, my child.’

mr. creakle, at whom of course i looked, shook his head without looking
at me, and stopped up a sigh with a very large piece of buttered toast.

‘you are too young to know how the world changes every day,’ said mrs.
creakle, ‘and how the people in it pass away. but we all have to learn

which has often, without my invocation, come before me like a ghost, and
haunted happier times.

i had been out, one day, loitering somewhere, in the listless,
meditative manner that my way of life engendered, when, turning the
corner of a lane near our house, i came upon mr. murdstone walking with
a gentleman. i was confused, and was going by them, when the gentleman
cried:

‘what! brooks!’

‘no, sir, david copperfield,’ i said.

‘don’t tell me. you are brooks,’ said the gentleman. ‘you are brooks of
sheffield. that’s your name.’

at these words, i observed the gentleman more attentively. his laugh
coming to my remembrance too, i knew him to be mr. quinion, whom i
had gone over to lowestoft with mr. murdstone to see, before--it is no
matter--i need not recall when.

‘and how do you get on, and where are you being educated, brooks?’ said
mr. quinion.

he had put his hand upon my

 to dig up some little root there. then, without
a scrap of courage, but with a great deal of desperation, i went softly
in and stood beside her, touching her with my finger.

‘if you please, ma’am,’ i began.

she started and looked up.

‘if you please, aunt.’

‘eh?’ exclaimed miss betsey, in a tone of amazement i have never heard
approached.

‘if you please, aunt, i am your nephew.’

‘oh, lord!’ said my aunt. and sat flat down in the garden-path.

‘i am david copperfield, of blunderstone, in suffolk--where you came,
on the night when i was born, and saw my dear mama. i have been very
unhappy since she died. i have been slighted, and taught nothing, and
thrown upon myself, and put to work not fit for me. it made me run away
to you. i was robbed at first setting out, and have walked all the
way, and have never slept in a bed since i began the journey.’ here
my self-support gave way all at once; and with a movement of my hands,

the room, until the gentleman who had squinted at me from the upper
window came in laughing.

‘mr. dick,’ said my aunt, ‘don’t be a fool, because nobody can be more
discreet than you can, when you choose. we all know that. so don’t be a
fool, whatever you are.’

the gentleman was serious immediately, and looked at me, i thought, as
if he would entreat me to say nothing about the window.

‘mr. dick,’ said my aunt, ‘you have heard me mention david copperfield?
now don’t pretend not to have a memory, because you and i know better.’

‘david copperfield?’ said mr. dick, who did not appear to me to
remember much about it. ‘david copperfield? oh yes, to be sure. david,
certainly.’

‘well,’ said my aunt, ‘this is his boy--his son. he would be as like his
father as it’s possible to be, if he was not so like his mother, too.’

‘his son?’ said mr. dick. ‘david’s son? indeed!’

‘yes,’ pursued my aunt, ‘and he

and we should have been devoted to one another. where, in the name of
wonder, should his sister, betsey trotwood, have run from, or to?’

‘nowhere,’ said mr. dick.

‘well then,’ returned my aunt, softened by the reply, ‘how can you
pretend to be wool-gathering, dick, when you are as sharp as a surgeon’s
lancet? now, here you see young david copperfield, and the question i
put to you is, what shall i do with him?’

‘what shall you do with him?’ said mr. dick, feebly, scratching his
head. ‘oh! do with him?’

‘yes,’ said my aunt, with a grave look, and her forefinger held up.
‘come! i want some very sound advice.’

‘why, if i was you,’ said mr. dick, considering, and looking vacantly
at me, ‘i should--’ the contemplation of me seemed to inspire him with a
sudden idea, and he added, briskly, ‘i should wash h

no exceptions. i don’t allow anybody to do it.’

‘your regulation is rather awkward to strangers,’ said miss murdstone.

‘is it!’ said my aunt.

mr. murdstone seemed afraid of a renewal of hostilities, and interposing
began:

‘miss trotwood!’

‘i beg your pardon,’ observed my aunt with a keen look. ‘you are the mr.
murdstone who married the widow of my late nephew, david copperfield, of
blunderstone rookery!--though why rookery, i don’t know!’

‘i am,’ said mr. murdstone.

‘you’ll excuse my saying, sir,’ returned my aunt, ‘that i think it would
have been a much better and happier thing if you had left that poor
child alone.’

‘i so far agree with what miss trotwood has remarked,’ observed miss
murdstone, bridling, ‘that i consider our lamented clara to have been,
in all essential respects, a mere child.’

‘it is a comfort to you and

‘died with her,’ replied mr. murdstone.

‘and there was no settlement of the little property--the house and
garden--the what’s-its-name rookery without any rooks in it--upon her
boy?’

‘it had been left to her, unconditionally, by her first husband,’
mr. murdstone began, when my aunt caught him up with the greatest
irascibility and impatience.

‘good lord, man, there’s no occasion to say that. left to her
unconditionally! i think i see david copperfield looking forward to any
condition of any sort or kind, though it stared him point-blank in the
face! of course it was left to her unconditionally. but when she married
again--when she took that most disastrous step of marrying you, in
short,’ said my aunt, ‘to be plain--did no one put in a word for the boy
at that time?’

‘my late wife loved her second husband, ma’am,’ said mr. murdstone, ‘and
trusted implicitly in him.’

ture with the polished head told me a long story, which i think was
about gardening. i think i heard him say, ‘my gardener’, several times.
i seemed to pay the deepest attention to him, but i was wandering in a
garden of eden all the while, with dora.

my apprehensions of being disparaged to the object of my engrossing
affection were revived when we went into the drawing-room, by the grim
and distant aspect of miss murdstone. but i was relieved of them in an
unexpected manner.

‘david copperfield,’ said miss murdstone, beckoning me aside into a
window. ‘a word.’

i confronted miss murdstone alone.

‘david copperfield,’ said miss murdstone, ‘i need not enlarge upon
family circumstances. they are not a tempting subject.’ ‘far from it,
ma’am,’ i returned.

‘far from it,’ assented miss murdstone. ‘i do not wish to revive
the memory of past differences, or of past outrages. i have received
outrages from a person--a female i am sorry to say, for the credit

 of my
sex--who is not to be mentioned without scorn and disgust; and therefore
i would rather not mention her.’

i felt very fiery on my aunt’s account; but i said it would certainly be
better, if miss murdstone pleased, not to mention her. i could not hear
her disrespectfully mentioned, i added, without expressing my opinion in
a decided tone.

miss murdstone shut her eyes, and disdainfully inclined her head; then,
slowly opening her eyes, resumed:

‘david copperfield, i shall not attempt to disguise the fact, that i
formed an unfavourable opinion of you in your childhood. it may have
been a mistaken one, or you may have ceased to justify it. that is not
in question between us now. i belong to a family remarkable, i believe,
for some firmness; and i am not the creature of circumstance or change.
i may have my opinion of you. you may have your opinion of me.’

i inclined my head, in my turn.

‘but it is not necessary,’ said miss murdstone, ‘t

and inclined my head.

‘no, thank you!’ said mr. spenlow, coldly, as i mechanically offered
them back to him. ‘i will not deprive you of them. miss murdstone, be so
good as to proceed!’

that gentle creature, after a moment’s thoughtful survey of the carpet,
delivered herself with much dry unction as follows.

‘i must confess to having entertained my suspicions of miss spenlow, in
reference to david copperfield, for some time. i observed miss spenlow
and david copperfield, when they first met; and the impression made upon
me then was not agreeable. the depravity of the human heart is such--’

‘you will oblige me, ma’am,’ interrupted mr. spenlow, ‘by confining
yourself to facts.’

miss murdstone cast down her eyes, shook her head as if protesting
against this unseemly interruption, and with frowning dignity resumed:

‘since i am to confine myself to facts, i will state them as d

i have already said, sir, that i have had my suspicions of miss spenlow,
in reference to david copperfield, for some time. i have frequently
endeavoured to find decisive corroboration of those suspicions, but
without effect. i have therefore forborne to mention them to miss
spenlow’s father’; looking severely at him--‘knowing how little
disposition there usually is in such cases, to acknowledge the
conscientious discharge of duty.’

mr. spenlow seemed quite cowed by the gentlemanly sternness of miss
murdstone’s manner, and deprecated her severity with a conciliatory
little wave of

when dislodged, he still kept the letter in his mouth; and on my
endeavouring to take it from him, at the imminent risk of being bitten,
he kept it between his teeth so pertinaciously as to suffer himself
to be held suspended in the air by means of the document. at length i
obtained possession of it. after perusing it, i taxed miss spenlow with
having many such letters in her possession; and ultimately obtained from
her the packet which is now in david copperfield’s hand.’

here she ceased; and snapping her reticule again, and shutting her
mouth, looked as if she might be broken, but could never be bent.

to ask, mr. copperfield, if you have anything to say in reply?’

why does traddles look so important when he calls upon me this afternoon
in the commons--where i still occasionally attend, for form’s sake, when
i have time? the realization of my boyish day-dreams is at hand. i am
going to take out the licence.

it is a little document to do so much; and traddles contemplates it,
as it lies upon my desk, half in admiration, half in awe. there are the
names, in the sweet old visionary connexion, david copperfield and dora
spenlow; and there, in the corner, is that parental institution,
the stamp office, which is so benignantly interested in the various
transactions of human life, looking down upon our union; and there is
the archbishop of canterbury invoking a blessing on us in print, and
doing it as cheap as could possibly be expected.

‘mr. wickfield is unwell in bed, sir, of a rheumatic fever,’ he
returned; ‘but miss wickfield, i have no doubt, will be happy to see old
friends. will you walk in, sir?’

he preceded us to the dining-room--the first room i had entered in that
house--and flinging open the door of mr. wickfield’s former office,
said, in a sonorous voice:

‘miss trotwood, mr. david copperfield, mr. thomas traddles, and mr.

i had not seen uriah heep since the time of the blow. our visit
astonished him, evidently; not the less, i dare say, because it
astonished ourselves. he did not gather his eyebrows together, for he
had none worth mentioning; but he frowned to that degree that he almost
closed his small eyes, while the hurried raising of his grisly hand to
his chin betrayed some trepidation or surprise. this was only when we
