  rom. ay, if i know the letters and the language.

  serv. ye say honestly. rest you merry!

  rom. stay, fellow; i can read.                       he reads.

      'signior martino and his wife and daughters;
      county anselmo and his beauteous sisters;
      the lady widow of vitruvio;
      signior placentio and his lovely nieces;
      mercutio and his brother valentine;
      mine uncle capulet, his wife, and daughters;
      my fair niece rosaline and livia;
      signior valentio and his cousin tybalt;
      lucio and the lively helena.'

    [gives back the paper.] a fair assembly. whither should they
    come?

  serv. up.

  rom. whither?

  serv. to supper, to our house.

  rom. whose house?

  serv. my master's.

  rom. indeed i should have ask'd you that before.

  serv. now i'll tell you without asking. my master is the great
    rich capulet; and if you be not of the house of montagues, i pray
    come and c

  ben. at this same ancient feast of capulet's
    sups the fair rosaline whom thou so lov'st;
    with all the admired beauties of verona.
    go thither, and with unattainted eye
    compare her face with some that i shall show,
    and i will make thee think thy swan a crow.

  rom. when the devout religion of mine eye
    maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
    and these, who, often drown'd, could never die,
    transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
    one fairer than my love? the all-seeing sun
    ne'er saw her match since first

o.
    romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
    appear thou in the likeness of a sigh;
    speak but one rhyme, and i am satisfied!
    cry but 'ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove';
    speak to my gossip venus one fair word,
    one nickname for her purblind son and heir,
    young adam cupid, he that shot so trim
    when king cophetua lov'd the beggar maid!
    he heareth not, he stirreth not, be moveth not;
    the ape is dead, and i must conjure him.
    i conjure thee by rosaline's bright eyes.
    by her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
    by her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
    and the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
    that in thy likeness thou appear to us!

  ben. an if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.

  mer. this cannot anger him. 'twould anger him
    to raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
    of some strange nature, letting it there stand
    till she had laid it and conjur'd it down.
    that were some spite; my invocati

thy bed.
    care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
    and where care lodges sleep will never lie;
    but where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
    doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.
    therefore thy earliness doth me assure
    thou art uprous'd with some distemp'rature;
    or if not so, then here i hit it right-
    our romeo hath not been in bed to-night.

  rom. that last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.

  friar. god pardon sin! wast thou with rosaline?

  rom. with rosaline, my ghostly father? no.
    i have forgot that name, and that name's woe.

  friar. that's my good son! but where hast thou been then?

  rom. i'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
    i have been feasting with mine enemy,
    where on a sudden one hath wounded me
    that's by me wounded. both our remedies
    within thy help and holy physic lies.
    i bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
    my intercession likewise steads my foe.

  friar. be plain,

    riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

  rom. then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
    on the fair daughter of rich capulet;
    as mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,
    and all combin'd, save what thou must combine
    by holy marriage. when, and where, and how
    we met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,
    i'll tell thee as we pass; but this i pray,
    that thou consent to marry us to-day.

  friar. holy saint francis! what a change is here!
    is rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
    so soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
    not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
    jesu maria! what a deal of brine
    hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for rosaline!
    how much salt water thrown away in waste,
    to season love, that of it doth not taste!
    the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
    thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears.
    lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
    of an old tear that is not was

h'd off yet.
    if e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
    thou and these woes were all for rosaline.
    and art thou chang'd? pronounce this sentence then:
    women may fall when there's no strength in men.

  rom. thou chid'st me oft for loving rosaline.

  friar. for doting, not for loving, pupil mine.

  rom. and bad'st me bury love.

  friar. not in a grave
    to lay one in, another out to have.

  rom. i pray thee chide not. she whom i love now
    doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
    the other did not so.

  friar. o, she knew well
    thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
    but come, young waverer, come go with me.
    in one respect i'll thy assistant be;
    for this alliance may so happy pro

  mer. where the devil should this romeo be?
    came he not home to-night?

  ben. not to his father's. i spoke with his man.

  mer. why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that rosaline,
    torments him so that he will sure run mad.

  ben. tybalt, the kinsman to old capulet,
    hath sent a letter to his father's house.

  mer. a challenge, on my life.

  ben. romeo will answer it.

  mer. any man that can write may answer a letter.

  ben. nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares,
    being dared.

  mer. alas, poor romeo, he is already dead! stabb'd with a white
    wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the
