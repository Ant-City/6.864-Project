 quite silly. her feelings
were as inflated spiritually as they had been an hour ago esthetically,
before she lost baedeker. the dear george, now striding towards them
over the tombstones, seemed both pitiable and absurd. he approached, his
face in the shadow. he said:

â€œmiss bartlett.â€

â€œoh, good gracious me!â€ said lucy, suddenly collapsing and again seeing
the whole of life in a new perspective. â€œwhere? where?â€

â€œin the nave.â€

â€œi see. those gossiping little miss alans must have--â€ she checked
herself.

â€œpoor girl!â€ exploded mr. emerson. â€œpoor girl!â€

she could not let this pass, for it was just what she was feeling
herself.

â€œpoor girl? i fail to understand the point of that remark. i think
myself a very fortunate girl, i assure you. iâ€™m thoroughly happy, and
having a splendid time. pray donâ€™t waste time mourning over me. thereâ€™s
enough sorrow in the world, isnâ€™t there, without trying to invent it.
good-bye. thank you both so

or gossips. no, i cannot forget how
they behaved at mr. eagerâ€™s lecture at santa croce. oh, poor miss
honeychurch! it really was too bad. no, i have quite changed. i do not
like the emersons. they are not nice.â€

mr. beebe smiled nonchalantly. he had made a gentle effort to introduce
the emersons into bertolini society, and the effort had failed. he was
almost the only person who remained friendly to them. miss lavish, who
represented intellect, was avowedly hostile, and now the miss alans,
who stood for good breeding, were following her. miss bartlett, smarting
under an obligation, would scarcely be civil. the case of lucy was
different. she had given him a hazy account of her adventures in santa
croce, and he gathered that the two men had made a curious and possibly
concerted attempt to annex her, to show her the world from their own
strange standpoint, to interest her in their private sorrows and joys.
this was impertinent; he did not wish their cause to be championed b

 lucyâ€™s state of mind,
for she was trying to talk to mr. beebe at the same time.

â€œoh, it has been such a nuisance--first he, then they--no one knowing
what they wanted, and everyone so tiresome.â€

â€œbut they really are coming now,â€ said mr. beebe. â€œi wrote to miss
teresa a few days ago--she was wondering how often the butcher called,
and my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably. they
are coming. i heard from them this morning.

â€œi shall hate those miss alans!â€ mrs. honeychurch cried. â€œjust because
theyâ€™re old and silly oneâ€™s expected to say â€˜how sweet!â€™ i hate
their â€˜ifâ€™-ing and â€˜butâ€™-ing and â€˜andâ€™-ing. and poor lucy--serve her
right--worn to a shadow.â€

mr. beebe watched the shadow springing and shouting over the
tennis-court. cecil was absent--one did not play bumble-puppy when he
was there.

â€œwell, if they are coming--no, minnie, not saturn.â€ saturn was a

come down to impart it, in case he got hurt. he was not a coward and
bore necessary pain as well as any man. but he hated the physical
violence of the young. how right it was! sure enough it ended in a cry.

â€œi wish the miss alans could see this,â€ observed mr. beebe, just as
lucy, who was nursing the injured minnie, was in turn lifted off her
feet by her brother.

â€œwho are the miss alans?â€ freddy panted.

â€œrather not. more like anderson.â€

â€œoh, good gracious, there isnâ€™t going to be another muddle!â€ mrs.
honeychurch exclaimed. â€œdo you notice, lucy, iâ€™m always right? i said
donâ€™t interfere with cissie villa. iâ€™m always right. iâ€™m quite uneasy at
being always right so often.â€

â€œbut has cecil--â€

â€œfriends of cecilâ€™s,â€ he repeated, â€œâ€˜and so really dee-sire-rebel. ahem!
honeychurch, i have just telegraphed to them.â€™â€

she got up from the grass.

it was hard on lucy. mr. beebe sympathized with her very much. while she
believed that her snub about the miss alans came from sir harry otway,
she had borne it like a good girl. she might well â€œscreechâ€ when
she heard that it came partly from her lover. mr. vyse was a
tease--something worse than a tease: he took a malicious pleasure
in thwarting people. the clergyman, knowing this, looked at miss
honeychurch with more than his usual kindness.

when she exclaimed, â€œbut cecilâ€™s emersons--they canâ€™t possibly be the
same ones--there is that--â€ he did not consider that the exclamation
was str

 the conversation
while she recovered her composure. he diverted it as follows:

â€œthe emersons who were at florence, do you mean? no, i donâ€™t suppose it
will prove to be them. it is probably a long cry from them to friends
of mr. vyseâ€™s. oh, mrs. honeychurch, the oddest people! the queerest
people! for our part we liked them, didnâ€™t we?â€ he appealed to lucy.
â€œthere was a great scene over some violets. they picked violets and
filled all the vases in the room of these very miss alans who have
failed to come to cissie villa. poor little ladies! so shocked and so
pleased. it used to be one of miss catharineâ€™s great stories. â€˜my dear
sister loves flowers,â€™ it began. they found the whole room a mass of
blue--vases and jugs--and the story ends with â€˜so ungentlemanly and yet
so beautiful.â€™ it is all very difficult. yes, i always connect those
florentine emersons with violets.â€

â€œfiascoâ€™s done you this time,â€ remarked freddy, not seeing that his

he looked very attractive when his face was bright, and he dispelled her
ridiculous forebodings at once.

â€œi have heard,â€ she said. â€œfreddy has told us. naughty cecil! i suppose
i must forgive you. just think of all the trouble i took for nothing!
certainly the miss alans are a little tiresome, and iâ€™d rather have nice
friends of yours. but you oughtnâ€™t to tease one so.â€

â€œfriends of mine?â€ he laughed. â€œbut, lucy, the whole joke is to come!
come here.â€ but she remained standing where she was. â€œdo you know where
i met these desirable tenants? in the national gallery, when i was up to
see my mother last week.â€

â€œno, you donâ€™t,â€ she snapped. â€œyou donâ€™t know what the word means.â€

he stared at her, and felt again that she had failed to be leonardesque.
â€œno, you donâ€™t!â€

her face was inartistic--that of a peevish virago.

â€œit isnâ€™t fair, cecil. i blame you--i blame you very much indeed. you
had no business to undo my work about the miss alans, and make me look
ridiculous. you call it scoring off sir harry, but do you realize that
it is all at my expense? i consider it most disloyal of you.â€

she left him.

â€œtemper!â€ he thought, raising his eyebrows.

no, it was worse than temper--snobbishness. as long as lucy thought
that his own smart friends were supplanting the miss alans, she had
not minded. he perceived that these new tenants might be of value
educationally. he would tolerate the father and draw out the son, wh

the comic muse, though able to look after her own interests, did not
disdain the assistance of mr. vyse. his idea of bringing the emersons to
windy corner struck her as decidedly good, and she carried through the
negotiations without a hitch. sir harry otway signed the agreement,
met mr. emerson, who was duly disillusioned. the miss alans were
duly offended, and wrote a dignified letter to lucy, whom they held
responsible for the failure. mr. beebe planned pleasant moments for the
new-comers, and told mrs. honeychurch that freddy must call on them as
soon as they arrived. indeed, so ample was the museâ€™s equipment that she
permitted mr. harris, never a very robust criminal, to droop his head,
to be forgotten, and to die.

formally. old mr. emerson claimed her with much warmth, and said how
glad he was that she was going to be married. she said yes, she was glad
too; and then, as miss bartlett and minnie were lingering behind with
mr. beebe, she turned the conversation to a less disturbing topic, and
asked him how he liked his new house.

â€œvery much,â€ he replied, but there was a note of offence in his voice;
she had never known him offended before. he added: â€œwe find, though,
that the miss alans were coming, and that we have turned them out. women
mind such a thing. i am very much upset about it.â€

â€œi believe that there was some misunderstanding,â€ said mrs. honeychurch
uneasily.

â€œour landlord was told that we should be a different type of person,â€
 said george, who seemed disposed to carry the matter further. â€œhe
thought we should be artistic. he is disappointed.â€

â€œand i wonder whether we ought to write to the miss alans and offer to
give it up. what do you

â€œoh, stop now you have come,â€ said lucy lightly. she must avoid
censuring cecil. for it was on cecil that the little episode turned,
though his name was never mentioned.

â€œso george says. he says that the miss alans must go to the wall. yet it
does seem so unkind.â€

â€œthere is only a certain amount of kindness in the world,â€ said george,
watching the sunlight flash on the panels of the passing carriages.

â€œyes!â€ exclaimed mrs. honeychurch. â€œthatâ€™s exactly what i say. why all
this twiddling and twaddling over two miss alans?â€

â€œthere is a certain amount of kindness, just as there is a certain
amount of light,â€ he continued in measured tones. â€œwe cast a shadow
on something whe

â€œvery well, george doesnâ€™t mind tennis on sunday. no more do i. thatâ€™s
settled. mr. emerson, if you could come with your son we should be so
pleased.â€

he thanked her, but the walk sounded rather far; he could only potter
about in these days.

she turned to george: â€œand then he wants to give up his house to the
miss alans.â€

â€œi know,â€ said george, and put his arm round his fatherâ€™s neck. the
kindness that mr. beebe and lucy had always known to exist in him came
out suddenly, like sunlight touching a vast landscape--a touch of the
morning sun? she remembered that in all his perversities he had never
spoken against affection.

miss bartlett approached.

â€œyou know our cousin, miss bartlett,â€ said mrs. honeychurch pleasantly.
â€œyou met her with my daughter in florence.â€

â€œyes, indeed!â€

romance? most certainly they will go to constantinople. they are taken
in a snare that cannot fail. they will end by going round the world.â€

cecil listened civilly, and said he was sure that lucy would be amused
and interested.

â€œisnâ€™t romance capricious! i never notice it in you young people; you
do nothing but play lawn tennis, and say that romance is dead, while the
miss alans are struggling with all the weapons of propriety against the
terrible thing. â€˜a really comfortable pension at constantinople!â€™ so
they call it out of decency, but in their hearts they want a pension
with magic windows opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairyland
forlorn! no ordinary view will content the miss alans. they want the
pension keats.â€

â€œiâ€™m awfully sorry to interrupt, mr. beebe,â€ said freddy, â€œbut have you
any matches?â€

â€œthen you donâ€™t see the wonder of this greek visit. i havenâ€™t been
to greece myself, and donâ€™t mean to go, and i canâ€™t imagine any of my
friends going. it is altogether too big for our little lot. donâ€™t you
think so? italy is just about as much as we can manage. italy is heroic,
but greece is godlike or devilish--i am not sure which, and in either
case absolutely out of our suburban focus. all right, freddy--i am

e began to read her the letter. after
a few words her eyes grew alert, and soon she interrupted him with
â€œgoing abroad? when do they start?â€

â€œnext week, i gather.â€

â€œdid freddy say whether he was driving straight back?â€

â€œno, he didnâ€™t.â€

â€œbecause i do hope he wonâ€™t go gossiping.â€

so she did want to talk about her broken engagement. always complaisant,
he put the letter away. but she, at once exclaimed in a high voice, â€œoh,
do tell me more about the miss alans! how perfectly splendid of them to
go abroad!â€

â€œi want them to start from venice, and go in a cargo steamer down the
illyrian coast!â€

she laughed heartily. â€œoh, delightful! i wish theyâ€™d take me.â€

â€œhas italy filled you with the fever of travel? perhaps george emerson
is right. he says that â€˜italy is only an euphuism for fate.â€™â€

â€œoh, not italy, but constantinople. i have always longed to go to
constantinople. constantinople is practically asia, isnâ€™t it?â€

mr. beebe reminded her that constantinople was still unlikely, and that
the miss alans only aimed at athens, â€œwith delphi, perhaps, if the roads
are safe.â€ but this made no difference to her enthusiasm. she had always
longed to go to greece even more, it seemed. he saw, to his surprise,
that she was apparently serious.

â€œi didnâ€™t realize that you and the miss alans were still such friends,
after cissie villa.â€

â€œoh, thatâ€™s nothing; i assure you cissie villaâ€™s nothing to me; i would
give anything to go with them.â€

â€œwould your mother spare you again so soon? you have scarcely been home
three months.â€

â€œshe must spare me!â€ cried lucy, in growing excitement. â€œi simply must
go away. i have to.â€ she ran her fingers hysterically through her hair.
â€œdonâ€™t you see that i have to go away? i didnâ€™t realize at the time--and

â€œnothing about the past. i know little and care less about that; i am

loftily and rightly, and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we
think too highly of her. but the future. seriously, what do you think of
this greek plan?â€ he pulled out the letter again. â€œi donâ€™t know whether
you overheard, but she wants to join the miss alans in their mad career.
itâ€™s all--i canâ€™t explain--itâ€™s wrong.â€

miss bartlett read the letter in silence, laid it down, seemed to
hesitate, and then read it again.

â€œi canâ€™t see the point of it myself.â€

to his astonishment, she replied: â€œthere i cannot agree with you. in it
i spy lucyâ€™s salvation.â€

â€œreally. now, why?â€

â€œshe wanted to leave windy corner.â€

â€œi know--but it seems so odd, so unlike her, so--i was going to

â€œitâ€™s a song that cecil gave her. how odd girls are!â€

â€œwhatâ€™s that?â€ called lucy, stopping short.

â€œall right, dear,â€ said mrs. honeychurch kindly. she went into the
drawing-room, and mr. beebe heard her kiss lucy and say: â€œi am sorry i
was so cross about greece, but it came on the top of the dahlias.â€

rather a hard voice said: â€œthank you, mother; that doesnâ€™t matter a
bit.â€

â€œand you are right, too--greece will be all right; you can go if the
miss alans will have you.â€

â€œoh, splendid! oh, thank you!â€

mr. beebe followed. lucy still sat at the piano with her hands over the
keys. she was glad, but he had expected greater gladness. her mother
bent over her. freddy, to whom she had been singing, reclined on the
floor with his head against her, and an unlit pipe between his lips.
oddly enough, the group was beautiful. mr. beebe, who loved the art of
the past, was reminded of a favourite theme, the santa conversazione,

perhaps the song stated â€œthe better partâ€ rather too strongly. he half
fancied that the soaring accompaniment--which he did not lose in the
shout of the gale--really agreed with freddy, and was gently criticizing
the words that it adorned:

  â€œvacant heart and hand and eye

however, for the fourth time windy corner lay poised below him--now as a
beacon in the roaring tides of darkness.

the miss alans were found in their beloved temperance hotel near

mackintosh squares, digestive bread, and other continental necessaries.

they escaped, and lucy said with relief: â€œthatâ€™s all right. we just got
through that time.â€

but her mother was annoyed. â€œi should be told, dear, that i am
unsympathetic. but i cannot see why you didnâ€™t tell your friends about
cecil and be done with it. there all the time we had to sit fencing, and
almost telling lies, and be seen through, too, i dare say, which is most
unpleasant.â€

lucy had plenty to say in reply. she described the miss alansâ€™
character: they were such gossips, and if one told them, the news would
be everywhere in no time.

â€œbut why shouldnâ€™t it be everywhere in no time?â€

â€œbecause i settled with cecil not to announce it until i left england. i
shall tell them then. itâ€™s much pleasanter. how wet it is! letâ€™s turn in

throughout the squalor of her homeward drive--she spoke at once--his

chapter xx: the end of the middle ages

the miss alans did go to greece, but they went by themselves. they alone
of this little company will double malea and plough the waters of the
saronic gulf. they alone will visit athens and delphi, and either shrine
of intellectual song--that upon the acropolis, encircled by blue seas;
that under parnassus, where the eagles build and the bronze charioteer
drives undismayed towards infinity. trembling, anxious, cumbered with
much digestive bread, they did proceed to constantinople, they did go
round the
