en our present
level of understanding has allowed us to gain striking new insights into the workings of the universe.
a central thread in what follows will be those developments that carry forward the revolution in our
understanding of space and time initiated by einstein's special and general theories of relativity. we
will see that if string theory is correct, the fabric of our universe has properties that would likely have
dazzled even einstein.

the dilemma of space, time, and the quanta

space, time, and the eye of the beholder

in june 1905, twenty-six-year-old albert einstein submitted a technical article to the german annals
of  physics  in  which  he  came  to  grips  with  a  paradox  about  light  that  had  first  troubled  him  as  a
teenager, some ten years earlier. upon turning the final page of einstein's manuscript, the editor of the
journal, max planck, realized that the accepted scientific order had been overthrown. without hoopla
or fanfare, a patent

nation of the photons we shine on the metallic surface.

this  is  precisely  in  accord  with  the  experimental  data.  the  frequency  of  the  light  (its  color)
determines the speed of the ejected electrons; the total intensity of the light determines the number of
ejected  electrons. and  so  einstein  showed  that  planck's  guess  of  lumpy  energy  actually  reflects  a
fundamental feature of electromagnetic waves: they are composed of particles—photons—that are
little bundles, or quanta, of light. the lumpiness of the energy embodied by such waves is due to their
being composed of lumps.

einstein's insight represented great progress. but, as we shall now see, the story is not as tidy as

it might appear.

is it a wave or is it a particle?

everyone  knows  that  water—and  hence  water  waves—are  composed  of  a  huge  number  of  water
molecules. so is it really surprising that light waves are also composed of a huge number of particles,
namely photons? it is. but the s

infinite? we are forced to conclude that there is something seriously wrong. by closely examining the
basic properties of general relativity and quantum mechanics, we can identify what that something is.

the heart of quantum mechanics

when  heisenberg  discovered  the  uncertainty  principle,  physics  turned  a  sharp  corner,  never  to
retrace  its  steps.  probabilities,  wave  functions,  interference,  and  quanta  all  involve  radically  new
ways of seeing reality. nevertheless, a die-hard "classical" physicist might still have hung on to a
thread of hope that when all was said and done these departures would add up to a framework not too
distant from old ways of thinking. but the uncertainty principle cleanly and definitively undercut any
attempt to cling to the past.

the uncertainty principle tells us that the universe is a frenetic place when examined on smaller
