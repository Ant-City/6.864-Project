rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead
the play
 act one
two elizabethans passing time in a place without any visible character. they are well-dressed - hats, cloaks,
sticks and all. each of them has a large leather money bag. guildenstern's bag is nearly empty. rosencrantz's bag
is nearly full. the reason being: they are betting on the toss of a coin, in the following manner: guildenstern
(hereafter 'guil') takes a coin out of his bag, spins it, letting it fall. rosencrantz (hereafter 'ros') studies it,
announces it as "heads" (as it happens) and puts it into his own bag. then they repeat the process. they have
apparently been doing it for some time. the run of "heads" is impossible, yet ros betrays no surprise at all -
he feels none. however he is nice enough to feel a little embarrassed attaking so much money off his friend. let
that be his character note. guil is well alive t

 ros: tumblers, are you?
 player: we can give you a tumble if that's your taste and times being what they are... otherwise, for a jingle
of coin we can do you a selection of gory romances, full of fine cadence and corpses, pirated from italian;
and it doesn't take much to make a jingle - even a single coin has music in it.

 (ros and guil have got to their feet.)
 ros: my name is guildenstern, and this is rosencrantz.
 (guil confers briefly with him.)
 (without embarrassment.) i'm sorry - his name's guildenstern, and i'm rosencrantz.
 player: a pleasure. we've played to bigger, of course, but quality counts for something. i recognised you at
once -
 ros: and who are we?
 player: - as fellow artists.
 ros: i thought we were gentlemen.
 player: for some of us it is performance, for others, patronage. they are two sides of the same coin, or, let
us say, being as there are so many of us

 your visitation shall receive such thanks
 as fits the king's remembrance.

 might, by the sovereign power you have on us,
 put your dread pleasure more into command
 than to entreaty.
 guil: but we both obey,
 and here give up ourselves in the full bent
 to lay our service freely at your feet,
 to be commanded.
 claudius: thanks, rosencrantz (turning to ros who is caught unprepared, while guil bows) and gentle
guildenstern (turning to guil who is bent double).
 gertrude (correcting): thanks, guildenstern (turning to ros, who bows as guil checks upward movement
to bow too - both bent double, squinting at each other)... and gentle rosencrantz. (turning to guil, both
straightening up - guil checks again and bows again.)

 my too much changed son. go, some of you,
 and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is.

star, and our drift represents merely a slight chance of angle to it: we may seize the moment, toss it around while
the moment pass, a short dash here, an exploration there, but we are brought round full circle to face again the
single immutable fact - that we, rosencrantz and guildenstern, are taking hamlet to england.

him, awakened by a man standing on his saddle, are summoned, and arrive, and are instructed to glean what
afflicts him and draw him on to pleasures, such as a play, which unfortunately, as it turns out, is abandoned in some
confusion owing to certain nuances outside our appreciation - which, among other causes, results in, among
other effects, a high, not to say, homicidal, excitement in hamlet, whom we, in consequence, are escorting, for his

death. but since, so jump upon this bloody question, you from the polack wars, and you from england, are here
arrived, give order that these bodies high on a stage be placed to the view; and let me speak to the yet unknowing
world how these things came about: so shall you hear of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts, of accidental
judgements, casual
