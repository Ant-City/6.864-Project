out. the stage is empty. a noise begins in the next room.
fiers, leaning on a stick, walks quickly across the stage; he has just
been to meet lubov andreyevna. he wears an old-fashioned livery and a
tall hat. he is saying something to himself, but not a word of it can be
made out. the noise behind the stage gets louder and louder. a voice is
heard: â€œletâ€™s go in there.â€ enter lubov andreyevna, anya, and charlotta
ivanovna with a little dog on a chain, and all dressed in travelling
clothes, varya in a long coat and with a kerchief on her head. gaev,
simeonov-pischin, lopakhin, dunyasha with a parcel and an umbrella, and
a servant with luggage--all cross the room.]

anya. letâ€™s come through here. do you remember what this room is,
mother?

lubov. [joyfully, through her tears] the nursery!

varya. how cold it is! my hands are quite numb. [to lubov andreyevna]
your rooms, the white one and the violet one, are just as they used to
be, mother.

lubov. my dear nursery, oh, you beautiful roo

she used to be, just like a nun. and i knew dunyasha. [kisses her.]

gaev. the train was two hours late. there now; howâ€™s that for
punctuality?

charlotta. [to pischin] my dog eats nuts too.

pischin. [astonished] to think of that, now!

[all go out except anya and dunyasha.]

dunyasha. we did have to wait for you!

[takes off anyaâ€™s cloak and hat.]

anya. i didnâ€™t get any sleep for four nights on the journey.... iâ€™m
awfully cold.

have a run in the garden....oh, if i could only get to sleep! i didnâ€™t
sleep the whole journey, i was so bothered.

dunyasha. peter sergeyevitch came two days ago.

anya. [joyfully] peter!

dunyasha. he sleeps in the bath-house, he lives there. he said he was
afraid heâ€™d be in the way. [looks at her pocket-watch] i ought to wake
him, but barbara mihailovna told me not to. â€œdonâ€™t wake him,â€ she said.

[enter varya, a bunch of keys on her belt.]

varya. dunyasha, some coffee, quick. mother wants some.

dunyasha. this minute. [exit.]

varya. well, youâ€™ve come, glory be to god. home again. [caressing her]
my darling is back again! my pretty one is back again!

anya. i did have an awful time, i tell you.

varya. i can just imagine it!

anya. i went away in holy week; it was very cold then. charlotta talked
the whole way and would go on performing her tricks. why did you tie
charlotta on to me?

varya. you

couldnâ€™t go alone, darling, at seventeen!

anya. we went to paris; itâ€™s cold there and snowing. i talk french
perfectly horribly. my mother lives on the fifth floor. i go to her, and
find her there with various frenchmen, women, an old abbÃ© with a book,
and everything in tobacco smoke and with no comfort at all. i suddenly
became very sorry for mother--so sorry that i took her head in my arms
and hugged her and wouldnâ€™t let her go. then mother started hugging me
and crying....

varya. [weeping] donâ€™t say any more, donâ€™t say any more....

anya. sheâ€™s already sold her villa near mentone; sheâ€™s nothing left,
nothing. and i havenâ€™t a copeck left either; we only just managed to get
here. and mother wonâ€™t understand! we had dinner at a station; she asked
for all the expensive things, and tipped the waiters one rouble each.
and charlotta too. yasha wants his share too--itâ€™s too bad. motherâ€™s got
a footman now, yasha; weâ€™ve brought him here.

varya. i saw the wret

anya. howâ€™s business? has the interest been paid?

varya. not much chance of that.

anya. oh god, oh god...

varya. the place will be sold in august.

anya. o god....

lopakhin. [looks in at the door and moos] moo!... [exit.]

varya. [through her tears] iâ€™d like to.... [shakes her fist.]

anya. [embraces varya, softly] varya, has he proposed to you? [varya
shakes head] but he loves you.... why donâ€™t you make up your minds? why
do you keep on waiting?

varya. i think that it will all come to nothing. heâ€™s a busy man. iâ€™m
not his affair... he pays no attention to me. bless the man, i donâ€™t
want to see him.... but everybody talks about our marriage, everybody
congratulates me, and thereâ€™s nothing in it at all, itâ€™s all like a
dream. [in another tone] youâ€™ve got a brooch like a bee.

anya. [sadly] mother bought it. [goes into her room, and talks lightly,
like a child] in paris i went up in a balloon!

varya. my darlingâ€™s come back, my pr

etty oneâ€™s come back! [dunyasha has
already returned with the coffee-pot and is making the coffee, varya
stands near the door] i go about all day, looking after the house, and
i think all the time, if only you could marry a rich man, then iâ€™d be
happy and would go away somewhere by myself, then to kiev... to moscow,
and so on, from one holy place to another. iâ€™d tramp and tramp. that
would be splendid!

anya. the birds are singing in the garden. what time is it now?

varya. it must be getting on for three. time you went to sleep, darling.
[goes into anyaâ€™s room] splendid!

[enter yasha with a plaid shawl and a travelling bag.]

yasha. [crossing the stage: politely] may i go this way?

dunyasha. i hardly knew you, yasha. you have changed abroad.

yasha. hm... and who are you?

dunyasha. when you went away i was only so high. [showing with her hand]
iâ€™m dunyasha, the daughter of theodore kozoyedov. you donâ€™t remember!

yasha. oh, you little cucumber!

goes out quickly.]

varya. [in the doorway: in an angry voice] whatâ€™s that?

dunyasha. [through her tears] iâ€™ve broken a saucer.

varya. it may bring luck.

anya. [coming out of her room] we must tell mother that peterâ€™s here.

varya. i told them not to wake him.

anya. [thoughtfully] father died six years ago, and a month later my
brother grisha was drowned in the river--such a dear little boy of
seven! mother couldnâ€™t bear it; she went away, away, without looking
round.... [shudders] how i understand her; if only she knew! [pause] and
peter trofimov was grishaâ€™s tutor, he might tell her....

dunyasha, severely] you! whereâ€™s the cream?

dunyasha. oh, dear me...! [rapid exit.]

fiers. [fussing round the coffee-pot] oh, you bungler.... [murmurs
to himself] back from paris... the master went to paris once... in a
carriage.... [laughs.]

varya. what are you talking about, fiers?

fiers. i beg your pardon? [joyfully] the mistress is home again. iâ€™ve
lived to see her! donâ€™t care if i die now.... [weeps with joy.]

[enter lubov andreyevna, gaev, lopakhin, and simeonov-pischin, the
latter in a long jacket of thin cloth and loose trousers. gaev, coming
in, moves his arms and body about as if he is playing billiards.]

anya. iâ€™m going to bed. good-night, mother. [kisses her.]

lubov. my lovely little one. [kisses her hand] glad to be at home? i
canâ€™t get over it.

anya. good-night, uncle.

gaev. [kisses her face and hands] god be with you. how you do resemble
your mother! [to his sister] you were just like her at her age, luba.

[anya gives her hand to lopakhin and pischin and goes out, shutting the
door behind her.]

lubov. sheâ€™s awfully tired.

pischin. itâ€™s a very long journey.

varya. [to lopakhin and pischin] well, sirs, itâ€™s getting on for three,
quite time you went.

lubov. [laughs] youâ€™re just the same as ever, varya. [draws her close
and kisses her] iâ€™ll have some coffee now, then weâ€™ll all go. [fiers
lays a cushion under her feet] thank you, dear. iâ€™m used to coffee. i
drink it day and night. thank you, dear old man. [kisses fiers.]

varya. iâ€™ll go and see if theyâ€™ve brought in all the luggage. [exit.]

lubov. is it really i who am sitting here? [laughs]
 
 ___________________________
 
ow in the villages there were only the gentry and the
labourers, and now the people who live in villas have arrived. all towns
now, even small ones, are surrounded by villas. and itâ€™s safe to say
that in twenty yearsâ€™ time the villa resident will be all over the
place. at present he sits on his balcony and drinks tea, but it may well
come to pass that heâ€™ll begin to cultivate his patch of land, and then
your cherry orchard will be happy, rich, splendid....

gaev. [angry] what rot!

[enter varya and yasha.]

varya. there are two telegrams for you, little mother. [picks out a key
and noisily unlocks an antique cupboard] here they are.

lubov. theyâ€™re from paris.... [tears them up without reading them] iâ€™ve
done with paris.

gaev. and do you know, luba, how old this case is? a week ago i took out
the bottom drawer; i looked and saw figures burnt out in it. that case
was made exactly a hundred years ago. what do you think of that? what?
we could celebrate its jubilee. it hasnâ€™t a so

now?

pischin. you oughtnâ€™t to take medicines, dear madam; they do you neither
harm nor good.... give them here, dear madam. [takes the pills, turns
them out into the palm of his hand, blows on them, puts them into his
mouth, and drinks some kvass] there!

lubov. [frightened] youâ€™re off your head!

pischin. iâ€™ve taken all the pills.

lopakhin. gormandizer! [all laugh.]

fiers. they were here in easter week and ate half a pailful of
cucumbers.... [mumbles.]

lubov. whatâ€™s he driving at?

varya. heâ€™s been mumbling away for three years. weâ€™re used to that.

yasha. senile decay.

[charlotta ivanovna crosses the stage, dressed in white: she is very
thin and tightly laced; has a lorgnette at her waist.]

lopakhin. excuse me, charlotta ivanovna, i havenâ€™t said â€œhow do you doâ€
 to you yet. [tries to kiss her hand.]

charlotta. [takes her hand away] if you let people kiss your hand, then
theyâ€™ll want your elbow, then your shoulder, and then...

lopakhin. my luckâ€™s out to-day! [
 
 ___________________________
 
all laugh] show us a trick, charlotta
ivanovna!

lubov andreyevna. charlotta, do us a trick.

charlotta. itâ€™s not necessary. i want to go to bed. [exit.]

lopakhin. we shall see each other in three weeks. [kisses lubov
andreyevnaâ€™s hand] now, good-bye. itâ€™s time to go. [to gaev] see you
again. [kisses pischin] au revoir. [gives his hand to varya, then to
fiers and to yasha] i donâ€™t want to go away. [to lubov andreyevna]. if
you think about the villas and make up your mind, then just let me
know, and iâ€™ll raise a loan of 50,000 roubles at once. think about it
seriously.

varya. [angrily] do go, now!

lopakhin. iâ€™m going, iâ€™m going.... [exit.]

gaev. snob. still, i beg pardon.... varyaâ€™s going to marry him, heâ€™s
varyaâ€™s young man.

varya. donâ€™t talk too much, uncle.

lubov. why not, varya? i should be very glad. heâ€™s a

pischin. to speak the honest truth... heâ€™s a worthy man.... and my
dashenka... also says that... she says lots of things. [snores, but
wakes up again at once] but still, dear madam, if you could lend me...
240 roubles... to pay the interest on my mortgage to-morrow...

varya. [frightened] we havenâ€™t got it, we havenâ€™t got it!

lubov. itâ€™s quite true. iâ€™ve nothing at all.

pischin. iâ€™ll find it all right [laughs] i never lose hope. i used to
think, â€œeverythingâ€™s lost now. iâ€™m a dead man,â€ when, lo and behold, a
railway was built over my land... and they paid me for it. and something
else will happen to-day or to-morrow. dashenka may win 20,000 roubles...
sheâ€™s got a lottery ticket.

lubov. the coffeeâ€™s all gone, we can go to bed.

the wrong trousers again. what am i to do with you?

varya. [quietly] anyaâ€™s asleep. [opens window quietly] the sun has risen
already; it isnâ€™t cold. look, little mother: what lovely trees! and the
air! the starlings are singing!

gaev. [opens the other window] the whole gardenâ€™s white. you havenâ€™t
forgotten, luba? thereâ€™s that long avenue going straight, straight, like
a stretched strap; it shines on moonlight nights. do you remember? you
havenâ€™t forgotten?

lubov. [looks out into the garden] oh, my childhood, days of my
innocence! in this

all, all white! oh, my orchard! after the dark autumns and the cold
winters, youâ€™re young again, full of happiness, the angels of heaven
havenâ€™t left you.... if only i could take my heavy burden off my breast
and shoulders, if i could forget my past!

gaev. yes, and theyâ€™ll sell this orchard to pay off debts. how strange
it seems!

lubov. look, thereâ€™s my dead mother going in the orchard... dressed in
white! [laughs from joy] thatâ€™s she.

gaev. where?

varya. god bless you, little mother.

lubov. thereâ€™s nobody there; i thought i saw somebody. on the right, at
the turning by the summer-house, a white little tree bent down, looking
just like a woman. [enter trofimov in a worn student uniform and
spectacles] what a marvellous garden! white masses of flowers, the blue
sky....

trofimov. lubov andreyevna! [she looks round at him] i only want to show
myself, and iâ€™ll go away. [kisses her hand warmly] i was told to wait
till the morning, but i didnâ€

varya. [crying] itâ€™s peter trofimov.

trofimov. peter trofimov, once the tutor of your grisha.... have i
changed so much?

[lubov andreyevna embraces him and cries softly.]

gaev. [confused] thatâ€™s enough, thatâ€™s enough, luba.

varya. [weeps] but i told you, peter, to wait till to-morrow.

lubov. my grisha... my boy... grisha... my son.

varya. what are we to do, little mother? itâ€™s the will of god.

trofimov. [softly, through his tears] itâ€™s all right, itâ€™s all right.

lubov. [still weeping] my boyâ€™s dead; he was drowned. why? why, my
friend? [softly] anyaâ€™s asleep in there. i am speaking so loudly, making
such a noise.... well, peter? whatâ€™s made you look so bad? why have you
grown so old?

trofimov. in the train an old woman called me a decayed gentleman.

lubov. you were quite a boy then, a nice little student, and no

hair is not at all thick and you wear spectacles. are you really still a
student? [goes to the door.]

trofimov. i suppose i shall always be a student.

lubov. [kisses her brother, then varya] well, letâ€™s go to bed.... and
youâ€™ve grown older, leonid.

pischin. [follows her] yes, weâ€™ve got to go to bed.... oh, my gout! iâ€™ll
stay the night here. if only, lubov andreyevna, my dear, you could get
me 240 roubles to-morrow morning--

gaev. still the same story.

pischin. two hundred and forty roubles... to pay the interest on the
mortgage.

lubov. i havenâ€™t any money, dear man.

pischin. iâ€™ll give it back... itâ€™s a small sum....

lubov. well, then, leonid will give it to you

.... let him have it,
leonid.

gaev. by all means; hold out your hand.

lubov. why not? he wants it; heâ€™ll give it back.

[lubov andreyevna, trofimov, pischin, and fiers go out. gaev, varya, and
yasha remain.]

gaev. my sister hasnâ€™t lost the habit of throwing money about. [to
yasha] stand off, do; you smell of poultry.

yasha. [grins] you are just the same as ever, leonid andreyevitch.

gaev. really? [to varya] whatâ€™s he saying?

varya. [to yasha] your motherâ€™s come from the village; sheâ€™s been
sitting in the servantsâ€™ room since yesterday, and wants to see you....

yasha. bless the woman!

varya. shameless man.

yasha. a lot of use there is in her coming. she might have come tomorrow
just as well. [exit.]

varya. mother hasnâ€™t altered a scrap, sheâ€™s just as she always was.
sheâ€™d give away everything, if the idea only entered her head.

gaev. yes.... [pause] if thereâ€™s any illness for which people offer many

man, it would be nice to go to yaroslav and try my luck with my aunt the
countess. my aunt is very, very rich.

varya. [weeps] if only god helped us.

gaev. donâ€™t cry. my auntâ€™s very rich, but she doesnâ€™t like us. my
sister, in the first place, married an advocate, not a noble.... [anya
appears in the doorway] she not only married a man who was not a noble,
but she behaved herself in a way which cannot be described as proper.
sheâ€™s nice and kind and charming, and iâ€™m very fond of her, but say what
you will in her favour and you still have to admit that sheâ€™s wicked;

varya. [whispers] anyaâ€™s in the doorway.

gaev. really? [pause] itâ€™s curious, somethingâ€™s got into my right eye...
i canâ€™t see properly out of it. and on thursday, when i was at the
district court...

[enter anya.]

varya. why arenâ€™t you in bed, anya?

anya. canâ€™t sleep. itâ€™s no good.

gaev. my darling! [kisses anyaâ€™s face and hands] my child.... [crying]
youâ€™re not my niece, youâ€™re my angel, youâ€™re my all.... believe in me,
believe...

anya. i do believe in you, uncle. everybody loves you and respects
you... but, uncle dear, you ought to say nothing, no more than that.
what were you saying just now about my mother, your own sister? why did
you say those things?

gaev. yes, yes. [covers his face wi

varya. yes, uncle dear, you really ought to say less. keep quiet, thatâ€™s
all.

anya. youâ€™d be so much happier in yourself if you only kept quiet.

gaev. all right, iâ€™ll be quiet. [kisses their hands] iâ€™ll be quiet. but
letâ€™s talk business. on thursday i was in the district court, and a lot
of us met there together, and we began to talk of this, that, and the
other, and now i think i can arrange a loan to pay the interest into the
bank.

varya. if only god would help us!

gaev. iâ€™ll go on

tuesday. iâ€™ll talk with them about it again. [to varya]
donâ€™t howl. [to anya] your mother will have a talk to lopakhin; he, of
course, wonâ€™t refuse... and when youâ€™ve rested youâ€™ll go to yaroslav to
the countess, your grandmother. so you see, weâ€™ll have three irons in
the fire, and weâ€™ll be safe. weâ€™ll pay up the interest. iâ€™m certain.
[puts some sugar-candy into his mouth] i swear on my honour, on anything
you will, that the estate will not be sold! [excitedly] i swear on my

[enter fiers.]

fiers. [reproachfully] leonid andreyevitch, donâ€™t you fear god? when are
you going to bed?

gaev. soon, soon. you go away, fiers. iâ€™ll undress myself. well,
children, bye-bye...! iâ€™ll give you the details to-morrow, but letâ€™s go
to bed now. [kisses anya and varya] iâ€™m a man of the eighties.... people
donâ€™t praise those years much, but i can still say that iâ€™ve suffered
for my beliefs. the peasants donâ€™t love me for nothing, i assure you.
weâ€™ve got to learn to know the peasants! we ought to learn how....

anya. youâ€™re doing it again, uncle!

here while you were away. in the old servantsâ€™ part of the house, as you
know, only the old people live--little old efim and polya and evstigney,
and karp as well. they started letting some tramps or other spend the
night there--i said nothing. then i heard that they were saying that i
had ordered them to be fed on peas and nothing else; from meanness, you

the orchard, a shepherd plays his pipe. trofimov crosses the stage and

lubov. whoâ€™s smoking horrible cigars here? [sits.]

gaev. they built that railway; thatâ€™s made this place very handy. [sits]
went to town and had lunch... red in the middle! iâ€™d like to go in now
and have just one game.

lubov. youâ€™ll have time.

lopakhin. just one word! [imploringly] give me an answer!

gaev. [yawns] really!

lubov. [looks in her purse] i had a lot of money yesterday, but thereâ€™s
very little to-day. my poor varya feeds everybody on milk soup to
save money, in the kitchen the old people only get peas, and i spend
recklessly. [drops the purse, scattering gold coins] there, they are all
over the place.

yasha. permit me to pick them up. [collects the coins.]

lubov. please do, yasha. and why did i go and have lunch there?... a
horrid restaurant with band and tablecloths smelling of soap.... why
do you drink so much, leon? why do you eat so much? why do you talk so
much? you talked again too much to-day in

lopakhin. itâ€™s true. to speak the straight truth, we live a silly life.
[pause] my father was a peasant, an idiot, he understood nothing, he
didnâ€™t teach me, he was always drunk, and always used a stick on me. in
point of fact, iâ€™m a fool and an idiot too. iâ€™ve never learned anything,
my handwriting is bad, i write so that iâ€™m quite ashamed before people,
like a pig!

lubov. you ought to get married, my friend.

lopakhin. yes... thatâ€™s true.

lubov. why not to our varya? sheâ€™s a nice girl.

lopakhin. yes.

lubov. sheâ€™s quite homely in her ways, works all day, and, what matters
most, sheâ€™s in love with you. and youâ€™ve liked her for a long time.

lopakhin. well? i donâ€™t mind... sheâ€™s a nice girl. [pause.]

varya. better tell us something about the planets, peter.

lubov andreyevna. no, letâ€™s go on with yesterdayâ€™s talk!

trofimov. about what?

gaev. about the proud man.

trofimov. yesterday we talked for a long time but we didnâ€™t come to
anything in the end. thereâ€™s something mystical about the proud man, in
your sense. perhaps you are right from your point of view, but if you
take the matter simply, without complicating it, then what pride can
there be, what sense can there be in it, if a man

of a breaking string, which dies away sadly.]

trofimov. [to pischin] if the energy which you, in the course of your

that.

trofimov. she takes too much on herself, she keeps on interfering in
other peopleâ€™s business. the whole summer sheâ€™s given no peace to me or
to anya, sheâ€™s afraid weâ€™ll have a romance all to ourselves. what has it

epikhodov. you cannot, if i may say so, call me to order.

a corner as if for sale. the emptiness is felt. by the door that
leads out of the house and at the back of the stage, portmanteaux and
travelling paraphernalia are piled up. the door on the left is open; the
voices of varya and anya can be heard through it. lopakhin stands and
waits. yasha holds a tray with little tumblers of champagne. outside,
epikhodov is tying up a box. voices are heard behind the stage. the
peasants have come to say good-bye. the voice of gaev is heard: â€œthank

and quietly, fearing that somebody might hear them.]

gaev. [in despair] my sister, my sister....

lubov. my dear, my gentle, beautiful orchard! my life, my youth, my
happiness, good-bye!
