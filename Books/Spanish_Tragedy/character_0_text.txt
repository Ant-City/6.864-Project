 passage in the silent night.
    no sooner had she spoke but we were here,
    i wot not how, in the twinkling of an eye.

  revenge.  then know, andrea, that thou arriv'd
    where thou shalt see the author of thy death,
    don balthazar, the prince of portingal,
    depriv'd of life by bel-imperia:
    here sit we down to see the mystery,
    and serve for chorus in this tragedy.



[act i. scene 1.]
                [the spanish court]

                enter spanish king, general, castille, hieronimo.

  king.  now say, lord general: how fares our camp?

  gen.  all well, my sovereign liege, except some few
    that are deceas'd by fortune of the war.

  king.  but what portends thy cheerful countenance
    and posting to our presence thus in haste?
    speak, man:  hath fortune given us victory?

  gen.  victory, my liege, and that with little loss.

  king.  our portugals will pay us tribute then?

  gen.  tribute, and wonted homage therewithal.

  king.  then blest be heav'n, and guider

.  put off your greetings till our feast be done;
    now come and sit with us, and taste our cheer.

                sit to the banquet.

    sit down, young prince, you are our second guest;
    brother, sit down; and nephew, take your place.
    signior horatio, wait thou upon our cup,
    for well thou hast deserved to be honour'd.
    now, lordings, fall too: spain is portugal,
    and portugal is spain; we both are friends;
    tribute is paid, and we enjoy our right.
    but where is old hieronimo, our marshall?
    he promis'd us, in honour of our guest,
    to grace our banquet with some pompous jest.

                enter hieronimo with a drum, three knights,
                each with scutcheon; then he fetches three
                kings; they take their crowns and them
                captive.

    hieronimo, this makes content mine eye,
    although i sound not well the mystery.

  hiero.  the first arm'd knight that hung his scutcheon up

                he takes the scutcheon an

d gives it to
                the king.

    was english robert, earle of gloucester,
    who, when king stephen bore sway in albion,
    arriv'd with five and twenty thousand men
    in portingal, and, by success of war,
    enforc'd the king, then but a saracen,
    to bear the yoke of the english monarchy.

  king.  my lord of portingal, by this you see
    that which may comfort both your king and you,
    and make your late discomfort seem the less.
    but say, hieronimo:  what was the next?

  hiero.  the second knight that hung his scutcheon up

                he doth as he did before.

    was edmond, earle of kent in albion.
    when english richard wore the diadem,
    he came likewise and razed lisbon walls,
    and took the king of portingal in fight,--
    for which, and other such service done,
    he after was created duke of york.

  king.  this is another special argument
    that portingal may deign to bear our yoke,
    when it by little england

hath been yok'd.
    but now, hieronimo, what were the last?

  hiero.  the third and last, not least in our account,

                doing as before.

    was, as the rest, a valiant englishman,
    brave john of gaunt, the duke of lancaster,
    as by his scutcheon plainly may appear:
    he with a puissant army came to spain
    and took our king of castille prisoner.

  ambass.  this is an argument for our viceroy
    that spain may not insult for her success,
    since english warriors likewise conquer'd spain
    and made them

  king.  hieronimo, i drink to thee for this device,
    which hath pleas'd both the ambassador and me:
    pledge me, hieronimo, if thou love the king!

                takes the cup of horatio.

    my lord, i fear we sit but over-long,
    unless our dainties were more delicate,--
    but welcome are you to the best we have.
    now let us in, that you may be dispatch'd;
    i think our council is already set.

                exeunt omnes.

                [chorus.]

    to see him feast that gave me my death's wound?
    these pleasant sights are sorrow to my

  hor.                          what, will you murder me?

  lor.  aye; thus!  and thus!  these are the fruits of love!

                they stab him.

  bel.  o, save his life, and let me die for him!
    o, save him, brother!  save him, balthazar!
    i lov'd horatio, but he lov'd not me.

  bal.  but balthazar loves bel-imperia.

  lor.  although his life were still ambitious, proud,
    yet is he at the highest now he is dead.

  bel.  murder!  murder!  help!  hieronimo, help!

  lor.  come, stop her mouth!  away with her!

                exeunt.

                enter hieronimo in his shirt, &c.

  hiero.  what outcries pluck me from my naked bed,
    and chill my throbbing heart with trembling fear,
    which never danger yet could daunt before?
    who calls hieronimo?  speak; hear i am!
    i did not slumber; therefore 'twas no dream.
    no, no; it was some woman cried for help.
    and here within this garden did she cry,
    and in this garden must i r

    o earth, why didst thou not in time devour
    the vile profaner of this sacred bower?
    o poor horatio, what hadst thou misdone
    to leese thy life ere life was new begun?
    o wicked butcher, whatsoe'er thou wert,
    how could thou strangle virtue and desert?
    ay me, most wretched!  that have lost my joy
    in leesing my horatio, my sweet boy!

                enter isabell.

  isa.  my husband's absence makes my heart to throb.
    hieronimo!

  hiero.  here, isabella.  help me to lament;
    for sighs are stopp'd, and all my tears are spent.

  isa.  what world of grief--my son horatio!
    o where's the author of this endless woe?

  hiero.  to know the author were some ease of grief,
    for in revenge my heart would find relief.

  isa.  then is he gone?  and is my son gone too?
    o, gush out, tears!  fountains and floods of tears!
    blow, sighs, and raise an everlasting storm;
    for outrage fits our cursed wretchedness.

    and time will bring this treachery to light.

  hiero.  meanwhile, good isabella, cease thy plaints,
    or, at the least, dissemble them awhile;
    so shall we sooner find the practise out,
    and learn by whom all this was brought about.
    come, isabell, now let us take him up.

                they take him up.

    and bear him in from out this cursed place.
    i'll say his dirge,--singing fits not this case.
    o aliquis mihi quas pulchrum ver educat herbas

                hieronimo sets his breast unto his sword.

    entreat me not!  go, take the traitor hence!

    and, alexandro, let us honour thee
    with public notice of thy loyalty.
    to end those things articulated here

  hiero.  oh eyes!  no eyes but fountains fraught with tears;
    oh life! no life, but lively form of death;
    oh world! no world, but mass of public wrongs,
    confus'd and fill'd with murder and misdeeds;
    oh sacred heav'ns, if this unhallow'd deed,
    if this inhuman and barbarous attempt,
    if this incomparable murder thus

 my distressful son
    solicit me for notice of his death;
    the ugly fiends do sally forth of hell,
    and frame my heart with fierce inflamed thoughts;
    the cloudy day my discontents records,
    early begins to register my dreams
    and drive me forth to seek the murderer.
    eyes, life, world, heav'ns, hell, night and day,
    see, search, show, send, some man, some mean, that may--

                a letter falleth.

    what's here? a letter?  tush, it is not so!
    a letter for hieronimo.
    [reads]  "for want of ink receive this bloody writ.
    me hath my hapless brother hid from thee.
    revenge thyself on balthazar and him,
    for these were they that murdered thy son.
    hieronimo, revenge horatio's death,
    and better fare then bel-imperia doth!"--
    what means this unexpected miracle?
    my son slain by lorenzo and the prince?
    what cause had they horatio to malign?
    or what might move thee, bel-imperia,
    to accuse thy brother, had he been the mean?
   
 
 ___________________________
 
 hieronimo, beware!  thou art betray'd,
    and to entrap thy life this train is laid.
    advise thee therefore, be not credulous:
    this is devised to endanger thee,
    that thou, by this, lorenzo should'st accuse.
    and he, for thy dishonour done, should draw
    thy life in question and thy name in hate.
    dear was the life of my beloved son,
    and of his death behooves me be aveng'd:
    then hazard not thine own, hieronimo,
    but live t'effect thy resolution!
    i therefore will by circumstances try
    what i can gather to confirm this writ,
    and, harken near the duke of castile's house,
    close if i can with bel-imperia,
    to listen more, but nothing to bewray.

                enter pedringano.

    now, pedringano!

  ped.                  now, hieronimo!

  ped.                  i know not; here's my lord.

  lor.  what to do, hieronimo?  use me.

  hiero.  oh, no, my lord, i dare not, it must not be;
    i humbly thank your lordship.

  lor.                          why then, farewell!

  hiero.  my grief no heart, my thoughts no tongue can tell.

                exit.

  lor.  come hither, pedringano; see'st thou this?

  ped.  my lord, i see it, and suspect it too.

  lor.  this is that damned villain serberine,
    that hath, i fear, reveal'd horatio's death.

  ped.  my lord, he could not; 'twas so lately done,

  lor.  now to confirm the complot thou hast cast
    of all these practices, i'll spread the watch,
    upon precise commandment from the king
    strongly to guard the place where pedringano
    this night shall murder hapless serberine.
    thus must we work that will avoid distrust,
    thus must we practice to prevent mishap,
    and thus one ill another must expulse.
    this sly enquiry of hieronimo
    for bel-imperia breeds suspicion;
    and this suspicion bodes a further ill.
    as for myself, i know my secret fault,
    and so do they, but i have dealt for them.
    they that for coin their souls endangered
    to save my life, for coin shall venture theirs;
    and better 'tis that base companions die
    than by their life to hazard our good haps.
    nor shall they live for me to fear their faith;
    i'll trust myself, myself shall be my friend;
    for die they shall,--

  iii watch.  sirrah, confess, and therein play the priest.
    why hast thou thus unkindly kill'd the man?

  ped.  why, because he walk'd abroad so late.

  iii watch.  come sir, you had been better kept your bed
    then have committed this misdeed so late.

  ii watch.  come to the marshall's with the murderer!

  i watch.  on to hieronimo's!  help me here
    to bring the murder'd body with us too.

  ped.  hieronimo?  carry me before whom you will;
    what e'er he be, i'll answer him and you.
    and do your worst, for i defy you all!

  lor.  nor you nor me, my lord, but both in one;
    but i suspect--and the presumptions great--
    that by those base confed'rates in our fault
    touching the death of don horatio
    we are all betray'd to old hieronimo.

  bal.  betray'd, lorenzo? tush!  it cannot be.

  lor.  a guilty conscience urged with the thought
    of former evils, easily cannot err:
    i am persuaded--and dissuade me not--
    that all's revealed to hieronimo.
    and therefore know that i have cast it thus--

a scurvy jest that a man should jest himself to death?  alas, poor

  hiero.  thus must we toil in others men's extremes
    that know not how to remedy our own,
    and do them justice, when unjustly we
    for all our wrongs can compass no redress.
    but shall i never live to see the day
    that i may come by justice to the heav'ns
    to know the cause that may my cares allay?
    this toils my body, this consumeth age,
    that only i to all men just must be,

  hiero.  i have not seen a wretch so impudent.
    o monstrous times where murders are so light,
    and where the soul that should be shrin'd in heav'n
    solely delights in interdicted things,
    still wand'ring in the thorny passages
    that intercepts itself of happiness!
    murder?  o bloody monster!  god forbid
    a fault so foul should 'scape unpunished!
    dispatch and see this execution done;
    this makes me to remember thee, my son.

  depu.  why, wherefore stay you? have you hope of life?

  ped. why, aye.

  ped.  why, rascal, by my pardon from the king.

  hang.  stand you on that?  then you shall off with this.

                he turns him off.

  depu.  so, executioner, convey him hence;
    but let his body be unburied.
    let not the earth be choked or infect

                [the spanish court.]

                enter hieronimo with a ponyard in one hand,
                and a rope in the other.

  hiero.  now, sir, perhaps i come to see the king,
    the king sees me, and fain would hear my suit:
    why, is this not a strange and seld-seen thing
    that standers-by with toys should strike me mute?
    go to, i see their shifts, and say no more;
    hieronimo, 'tis time for thee to trudge!
    down by the dale that flows with purple gore
    standeth a fiery tower; there sits a judge

    and 'twixt his teeth he holds a fire-brand,
    that leads unto the lake where he doth stand.
    away, hieronimo; to him be gone:
    he'll do thee justice for horatio's death.
    turn down this path, thou shalt be with him straight;
    or this, and then thou need'st not take thy breath.
    this way, or that way?  soft and fair, not so!
    for, if i hang or kill myself, let's know
    who will revenge horatio's murther then!
    no, no; fie, no!  pardon me, i'll none of that:

                he flings away the dagger & halter.

    this way i'll take; and this way comes the king,

takes them up again.

    and here i'll have a fling at him, that's flat!
    and, balthazar, i'll be with thee to bring;
    and thee, lorenzo!  here's the king; nay, stay!
    and here,--aye, here,--there goes the hare away!

                enter king, ambassador, castille, and
                lorenzo.

    hath he receiv'd the articles we sent?

  hiero.  justice!  o, justice to hieronimo!

  hiero.  o!  is he so?

  king.  who is he that interrupts our business?

    although he send not that his son return--
    his ransom due to don horatio.

  hiero.  horatio?  who calls horatio?

  king.  and well remember'd, thank his majesty!
    here, see it given to horatio.

  hiero.  justice!  o justice!  justice, gentle king!

  king.  who is that?  hieronimo?

  hiero.  justice!  o justice!  o my son!  my son!
    my son, whom naught can ransom or redeem!

  lor.  hieronimo, you are not well advis'd.

  hiero.  away, lorenzo!  hinder me no more,
    for thou hast made me bankrupt of my bliss!

  king.  what means this outrage?
    will none of you restrain his fury?

  hiero.  nay, soft and fair; you shall not need to strive!
    needs must he go that the devils drive.

                exit.

  king.  what accident hath happ'd to hieronimo?
    i have not seen him to demean him so.

  lor.  my gracious lord, he is with extreme pride
    conceiv'd of young horatio, his son,
    and covetous of having himself
    the ransom of the young prince, balthazar,
    distract, and in a manner lunatic.

  king.  believe me, nephew, we are sorry for 't;
    this is the love that fathers bear their sons.
    but, gentle brother, go give to him this gold,
    the prince's ransom; let him have his due;

    'tis requisite his office be resign'd
    and giv'n to one of more discretion.

  king.  we shall increase his melancholy so.
    'tis best that we see further in it first;
    till when, ourself will hold exempt the place.
    and, brother, now bring in the ambassador,
    that he may be a witness of the match

[act iii.  scene 13.]

                [hieronimo's house.]

                enter hieronimo with a book in his hand.

  [hiero.]  vindicta mihi.
    aye, heav'n will be reveng'd of every ill,
    nor will they suffer murder unrepaid!
    then stay, hieronimo, attend their will;
    for mortal men may not appoint their time.
    per scelus semper tutum est sceleribus iter:
    strike, and strike home, where wrong is offer'd thee;
    for evils unto ills conductors be,
    and death's the worst of resolution.
    for he that thinks with patience to contend
    to quiet life, his life shall easily end.
    fata si miseros juvant, habes salutem;
    fata si vitam negant, habes sepulchrum:
    if destiny thy miseries do ease,

and happy shalt thou be;
    if destiny deny thee life, hieronimo,
    yet shalt thou be assured of a tomb;
    if neither, yet let this thy comfort be:
    heav'n covereth him that hath no burial.
    and, to conclude, i will revenge his death!
    but how?  not as the vulgar wits of men,
    with open, but inevitable ills;
    as by a secret, yet a certain mean,
    which under kindship will be cloaked best.
    wise men will take their opportunity,
    closely and safely fitting things to time;
    but in extremes advantage hath no time;
    and therefore

    thus, therefore, will i rest me in unrest,
    dissembling quiet in unquietness,
    not seeming that i know their villainies,
    that my simplicity may make them think
    that ignorantly i will let all slip;
    for ignorance, i wot, and well they know,
    remedium malorum iners est.
    nor aught avails it me to menace them.
    who, as a wintry storm upon a plain,
    will bear me down with their nobility.
    no, no, hieronimo, thou must enjoin
    thine eyes to observation, and thy tongue
    to milder speeches than thy spirit affords,
    thy heart to patience, and thy hands to rest,
    thy cap to courtesy, and thy knee to bow,
    till to revenge thou know when, where and how.

    o, no; not this!  horatio, this was thine!
    and when i dy'd it in thy dearest blood,
    this was a token twixt thy soul and me
    that of thy death revenged i should be.
    but here: take this, and this!  what? my purse?
    aye, this and that and all of them are thine;
    for all as one are our extremities.

    see here a loving father to his son:
    behold the sorrows and the sad laments
    that he deliv'reth for his son's decease.
    if love's effect so strives in lesser things,
    if love enforce such moods in meaner wits,
    if love express such power in poor estates,

    i'll down to hell and in this passion
    knock at the dismal gates of pluto's court,
    getting by force, as once alcides did,
    a troupe of furies and tormenting hags,
    to torture don lorenzo and the rest.
    yet, lest the triple-headed porter should
    deny my passage to the slimy strand,

    shiv'ring their limbs in pieces with my teeth!

                tears the papers.

    how is it possible i should slay it then?
    tush, no!  run after, catch me if you can!

    to plague hieronimo, that is remiss

    aye, my gracious lord, and this is the day

  cas.  thou wouldst be loath that any fault of thine
    should intercept her in her happiness?

  lor.  heav'ns will not let lorenzo err so much.

  cas.  why then, lorenzo, listen to my words:
    it is suspected, and reported too,
    that thou, lorenzo, wrong'st hieronimo,
    and in his suits toward his majesty
    still keep'st him back and seek'st to cross his suit.

  lor.  that i, my lord?

  cas.  i tell thee, son, myself have heard it said,
    when to my sorrow i have been asham'd
    to answer for thee, though thou art my son.
    lorenzo, know'st thou not the common love
    and kindness that hieronimo hath won
    by his deserts within the court of spain?
    or see'st thou not the king my brother's care
    in his behalf and to procure his health?

    tell me,--and look thou tell me truly too,--
    whence grows the ground of this report in court?

  lor.  my lord, it lies not in lorenzo's power
    to stop the vulgar, liberal of their tongues:
    a small advantage makes a water-breach;
    and no man lives that long contenteth all.

  cas.  myself have seen thee busy to keep back
    him and his supplications from the king.

  cas.  hieronimo, my son, mistakes thee then.

  lor.  my gracious father, believe me, so he doth;
    but what's a silly man, distract in mind,
    to think upon the murder of his son?
    alas, how easy is it for him to err!
    but, for his satisfaction and the world's,
    'twere good, my lord, that hieronimo and i

    we are to entreat your help.

  hie.           my help?
   why, my good lords, assure yourselves of me;
    for you have giv'n me cause,--
    aye, by my faith, have you!

  bal.                         it pleased you
    at the entertainment of the ambassador,
    to grace the king so much as with a show;
    now were your study so well furnished
    as, for the passing of the first night's sport,
    to entertain my father with the like,
    or any such like pleasing motion,

   which, long forgot, i found this other day.
    nor would your lordships favour me so much
    as but to grace me with your acting it,
    i mean each one of you to play a part.
    assure you it will prove most passing strange
    and wondrous plausible to that assembly.

  bal.  what, would you have us play a tragedy?

  hiero.  why, nero thought it no disparagement,
    and kings and emperors have ta'en delight
    to make experience of their wit in plays!

  lor.  nay, be not angry, good hieronimo;
    the prince but ask'd a question.

  bal.  in faith, hieronimo, and you be in earnest,
    i'll make one.

  lor.          and i another.

  hiero.  now, my good lord, could you entreat,
    your sister, bel-imperia, to make one,--
    for what's a play without a woman in it?

  bel.  little entreaty shall serve me, hieronimo,
    for i must needs be employed in your play.

  hiero.  why, this is well!  i tell you, lordings,
    it was determined to have been acted,

break his passions to a friend,
    one of his bashaws whom he held full dear.
    her has this bashaw long solicited,
    and saw she was not otherwise to be won
    but by her husband's death, this knight of rhodes,
    whom presently by treachery he slew.
    she, stirr'd with an exceeding hate therefore,
    as cause of this, slew sultan suleiman,
    and, to escape the bashaw's tyranny,
    did stab herself.  and this is the tragedy.

  lor.  o, excellent!

  bel.                  but say, hieronimo:
    what then became of him that was the bashaw?

  hiero.
                         marry thus:
   moved with remorse of his misdeeds,
    ran to a mountain top and hung himself.

  bal.  but which of us is to perform that part?

  hiero.  o, that will i, my lords; make no doubt of it;
    i'll play the murderer, i warrant you;
    for i already have conceited that.

  bal.  and what shall i?

  hiero.  great suleiman, the turkish emperor.

  lor.  and i?

                he giveth bel-imperia another.

    like phoebe, flora, or the huntress dian,
    which to your discretion shall seem best.
    and as for me, my lords, i'll look to one,
    and with the ransom that the viceroy sent
    so furnish and perform this tragedy
    as all the world shall say hieronimo
    was liberal in gracing of it so.

  bal. hieronimo, methinks a comedy were better.

  hiero.  a comedy?  fie!  comedies are fit for common wits;
    but to present a kingly troupe withal,
    give me a stately-written tragedy,--
    tragedia cothurnata, fitting kings,
    containing matter, and not common things!
    my lords, all this our sport must be perform'd,
    as fitting for the first night's revelling.
    the italian tragedians were so sharp
    of wit that in one hour's meditatio

    they would perform any-thing in action.

  lor.  and well it may, for i have seen the like
    in paris, 'mongst the french tragedians.

  hiero.  in paris? mass, and well remembered!--
    there's one thing more that rests for us to do.

  bal. what's that, hieronimo?
    forget not anything.

  hiero.                each one of us
    must act his part in unknown languages,
    that it may breed the more variety:
    as you, my lord, in latin, i in greek,
    you in italian, and, for-because i know
    that bel-imperia hath practised the french,
    in courtly french shall all her phrases be.

  bel.  you mean to try my cunning then, hieronimo!

  bal. but this will be a mere confusion,
    and hardly shall we all be understood.

    assure yourself, shall make the matter known.
    and all shall be concluded in one scene,
    for there's no pleasure ta'en in tediousness.

  bal.  [to lor.]  how like you this?

  lor. why thus, my lord, we must resolve,
    to soothe his humors up.

  bal.  on then, hieronimo; farewell till soon!

  hiero.  you'll ply this gear?

  lor.  i warrant you.

                exeuent all but hieronimo.

  hiero.  why, so!  now shall i see the fall of babylon
    wrought by the heav'ns in this confusion.
    and, if the world like not this tragedy,
    hard is the hap of old hieronimo.

  ghost.  aye; now my hopes have end in their effects,
    when blood and sorrow finish my desires:
    horatio murder'd in his father's bower,
    vile serberine by pedrigano slain,
    false pedrigano hang'd by quaint device,
    fair isabella by herself misdone,
    prince balthazar by bel-imperia stabb'd,
    the duke of castile and his wicked son
    both done to death by old hieronimo,
    my bel-imperia fallen as dido fell,
    and good hieronimo slain by himself!
    aye, these were spectacles to please my soul.
    now will i beg at lovely proserpine
    that, by the virtue of her princely doom,
    i may consort my friends in pleasing sort,
    and on my foes work just and sharp revenge.
    i'll lead my friend horatio through those fields
    where never-dying wars are still inur'd;
    i'll lead fair isabella to that train
    where pity weeps but never feeleth pain;

    against the rest how shall my hate be shown?

  revenge.  this hand shall hale them down to deepest hell,
    where none but furies, bugs and tortures dwell.
