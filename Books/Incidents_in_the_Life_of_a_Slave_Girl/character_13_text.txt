ection. i groped my way to the road, and rushed towards the town with almost lightning speed. i arrived at my grandmother's house, but dared not see her. she would say, "linda, you are killing me;" and i knew that would unnerve me. i tapped softly at the window of a room, occupied by a woman, who had lived in the house several years. i knew she was a faithful friend, and could be trusted with my secret. i tapped several times before she heard me. at last she raised the window, and i whispered, "sally, i have run away. let me in, quick." she opened the door softly, and said in low tones, "for god's sake, don't. your grandmother is trying to buy you and de chillern. mr. sands was here last week. he tole her he was going away on business, but he wanted her to go ahead about buying you and de chillern, and he would help her all he could. don't run away, linda. your grandmother is all bowed down wid trouble now."
