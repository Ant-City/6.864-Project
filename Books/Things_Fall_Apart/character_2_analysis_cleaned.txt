[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER], okonkwo's favorite daughter and the only
child of ekwefi, is bold in the way that she approaches--and even
sometimes contradicts--her father. okonkwo remarks to himself multiple
times that he wishes she had been born a boy, since he considers
her to have such a masculine spirit. [CHARACTER] alone seems to win okonkwo's
full attention, affection, and, ironically, respect. she and he
are kindred spirits, which boosts her confidence and precociousness.
she grows into a beautiful young woman who sensibly agrees to put
off marriage until her family returns from exile so as to help her
father leverage his sociopolitical power most effectively. in doing
so, she shows an approach similar to that of okonkwo: she puts strategy
ahead of emotion.
