evening  chow  mark  fossie  explained  how  he'd  set  it  up.  it  was
expensive, he admitted, and the logistics were complicated, but it wasn't
like  going  to  the  moon.  cleveland  to  los  angeles,  la  to  bangkok,
bangkok  to  saigon.  she'd  hopped  a  c-130  up  to  chu  lai  and  stayed
overnight at the uso and the next morning hooked a ride west with the
resupply chopper.

"a cinch," fossie said, and gazed down at his pretty girlfriend. "thing

is, you just got to want it enough."

mary anne bell and mark fossie had been sweethearts since grammar
school. from the sixth grade on they had known for a fact that someday
they  would  be  married,  and  live  in  a  fine  gingerbread  house  near  lake
erie,  and  have  three  healthy  yellow-haired  children,  and  grow  old



together,  and  no  doubt  die  in  each  other's  arms  and  be  buried  in  the
same walnut casket. that was the plan. they were very much in love, full

ings she liked
to dance to music from rat's portable tape deck. there was a novelty to
it; she was good for morale. at times she gave off a kind of come-get-me
energy, coy and flirtatious, but apparently it never bothered mark fossie.
in  fact  he  seemed  to  enjoy  it,  just  grinning  at  her,  because  he  was  so
much  in  love,  and  because  it  was  the  sort  of  show  that  a  girl  will
sometimes put on for her boyfriend's entertainment and education.

though she was young, rat said, mary anne bell was no timid child.
she was curious about things. during her first days in-country she liked
to roam around the compound asking questions: what exactly was a trip

eddie  about  what  happened,  it  almost  made  me  .  .  .  like  you  say,  it's

what  happened  to  her,  rat  said,  was  what  happened  to  all  of  them.
you come over clean and you get dirty and then afterward it's never the

all. for mary anne bell, it seemed, vietnam had the effect of a powerful
drug: that mix of unnamed terror and unnamed pleasure that comes as
the  needle  slips  in  and  you  know  you're  risking  something.  the
endorphins  start  to  flow,  and  the  adrenaline,  and  you  hold  your  breath
and creep quietly through the moonlit nightscapes; you become intimate
with danger; you're in touch with the far side of yourself, as though it's
another hemisphere, and you want to string it out and go wherever the
trip takes
