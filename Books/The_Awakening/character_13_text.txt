oup.

mr. pontellier scanned the names of his wifeâ€™s callers, reading some of
them aloud, with comments as he read.

â€œâ€˜the misses delasidas.â€™ i worked a big deal in futures for their father
this morning; nice girls; itâ€™s time they were getting married. â€˜mrs.
belthrop.â€™ i tell you what it is, edna; you canâ€™t afford to snub mrs.
belthrop. why, belthrop could buy and sell us ten times over. his
business is worth a good, round sum to me. youâ€™d better write her a
note. â€˜mrs. james highcamp.â€™ hugh! the less you have to do with mrs.
highcamp, the better. â€˜madame laforce.â€™ came all the way from carrolton,
too, poor old soul. â€˜miss wiggs,â€™ â€˜mrs. eleanor boltons.â€™â€ he pushed the
cards aside.

â€œmercy!â€ exclaimed edna, who had been fuming. â€œwhy are you taking the
thing so seriously and making such a fuss over it?â€

â€œiâ€™m not making any fuss over it. but itâ€™s just such seeming trifles
that weâ€™ve got to take seriously; such things count.â€

flourished, and he drew upon this fund of memories so that he might not
be left out and seem wholly devoid of the modern spirit. but he failed
to impose upon the colonel, and was even far from impressing him with
this trumped-up knowledge of bygone days. edna had staked her father
on his last venture, with the most gratifying results to both of them.
besides, they had met some very charming people, according to the
colonelâ€™s impressions. mrs. mortimer merriman and mrs. james highcamp,
who were there with alcee arobin, had joined them and had enlivened the
hours in a fashion that warmed him to think of.

mr. pontellier himself had no particular leaning toward horseracing, and
was even rather inclined to discourage it as a pastime, especially
when he considered the fate of that blue-grass farm in kentucky. he
endeavored, in a general way, to express a particular disapproval, and
only succeeded in arousing the ire and opposition of his father-in-law.
a pretty dispute followed,

edna went out and sought the society of
the friends she had made at grand isle. or else she stayed indoors
and nursed a mood with which she was becoming too familiar for her own
comfort and peace of mind. it was not despair; but it seemed to her as
if life were passing by, leaving its promise broken and unfulfilled.
yet there were other days when she listened, was led on and deceived by
fresh promises which her youth held out to her.

she went again to the races, and again. alcee arobin and mrs. highcamp
called for her one bright afternoon in arobinâ€™s drag. mrs. highcamp was
a worldly but unaffected, intelligent, slim, tall blonde woman in the
forties, with an indifferent manner and blue eyes that stared. she had
a daughter who served her as a pretext for cultivating the society of
young men of fashion. alcee arobin was one of them. he was a familiar
figure at the race course, the opera, the fashionable clubs. there was
a perpetual smile in his eyes, which seldom failed to awaken a

he had met her before on other occasions, but she had seemed to
him unapproachable until that day. it was at his instigation that mrs.
highcamp called to ask her to go with them to the jockey club to witness
the turf event of the season.

there were possibly a few track men out there who knew the race horse as
well as edna, but there was certainly none who knew it better. she sat
between her two companions as one having authority to speak. she laughed
at arobinâ€™s pretensions, and deplored mrs. highcampâ€™s ignorance. the
race horse was a friend and intimate associate of her childhood. the
atmosphere of the stables and the breath of the blue grass paddock
revived in her memory and lingered in her nostrils. she did not perceive
that she was talking like her father as the sleek geldings ambled in
review before them. she played for very high stakes, and fortune favored
her. the fever of the game flamed in her cheeks and eyes, and it got
into her blood and into her brain like an intoxicant. people

 turned
their heads to look at her, and more than one lent an attentive ear to
her utterances, hoping thereby to secure the elusive but ever-desired
â€œtip.â€ arobin caught the contagion of excitement which drew him to
edna like a magnet. mrs. highcamp remained, as usual, unmoved, with her
indifferent stare and uplifted eyebrows.

edna stayed and dined with mrs. highcamp upon being urged to do so.
arobin also remained and sent away his drag.

the dinner was quiet and uninteresting, save for the cheerful efforts
of arobin to enliven things. mrs. highcamp deplored the absence of her
daughter from the races, and tried to convey to her what she had missed
by going to the â€œdante readingâ€ instead of joining them. the girl held
a geranium leaf up to her nose and said nothing, but looked knowing and
noncommittal. mr. highcamp was a plain, bald-headed man, who only

talked under compulsion. he was unresponsive. mrs. highcamp was full of
delicate courtesy and consideration toward her husband. she addressed
most of her conversation to him at table. they sat in the library after
dinner and read the evening papers together under the droplight; while
the younger people went into the drawing-room near by and talked. miss
highcamp played some selections from grieg upon the piano. she seemed to
have apprehended all of the composerâ€™s coldness and none of his poetry.
while edna listened she could not help wondering if she

had lost her
taste for music.

when the time came for her to go home, mr. highcamp grunted a lame offer
to escort her, looking down at his slippered feet with tactless concern.
it was arobin who took her home. the car ride was long, and it was late
when they reached esplanade street. arobin asked permission to enter for
a second to light his cigarette--his match safe was empty. he filled his
match safe, but did not light his cigarette until he left her, after she
had expressed her willingness to go to the races with him again.

edna was neither tired nor sleepy. she was hungr

unted the money she had won. but
there was nothing else to do, so she went to bed, and tossed there for
hours in a sort of monotonous agitation.

in the middle of the night she remembered that she had forgotten to
write her regular letter to her husband; and she decided to do so next
day and tell him about her afternoon at the jockey club. she lay wide
awake composing a letter which was nothing like the one which she wrote
next day. when the maid awoke her in the morning edna was dreaming of
mr. highcamp playing the piano at the entrance of a music store on canal
street, while his wife was saying to alcee arobin, as they boarded an
esplanade street car:

â€œwhat a pity that so much talent has been neglected! but i must go.â€

when, a few days later, alcee arobin again called for edna in his drag,
mrs. highcamp was not with him. he said they would pick her up. but as
that lady had not been apprised of his intention of picking her up, she
was not at home. the daughter was just leaving the house

he moment that madame ratignolle was to the last degree
souffrante and unpresentable, and not foreseeing that madame lebrun
would send a thousand regrets at the last moment. so there were only
ten, after all, which made a cozy, comfortable number.

there were mr. and mrs. merriman, a pretty, vivacious little woman in
the thirties; her husband, a jovial fellow, something of a shallow-pate,
who laughed a good deal at other peopleâ€™s witticisms, and had thereby
made himself extremely popular. mrs. highcamp had accompanied them. of
course, there was alcee arobin; and mademoiselle reisz had consented
to come. edna had sent her a fresh bunch of violets with black lace
trimmings for her hair. monsieur ratignolle brought himself and his
wifeâ€™s excuses. victor lebrun, who happened to be in the city, bent upon
relaxation, had accepted with alacrity. there was a miss mayblunt, no
longer in her teens, who looked at the world through lorgnettes and with
the keenest interest. it was thought and said that

she was intellectual;
it was suspected of her that she wrote under a nom de guerre. she had
come with a gentleman by the name of gouvernail, connected with one of
the daily papers, of whom nothing special could be said, except that he
was observant and seemed quiet and inoffensive. edna herself made the
tenth, and at half-past eight they seated themselves at table, arobin
and monsieur ratignolle on either side of their hostess.

mrs. highcamp sat between arobin and victor lebrun. then came mrs.
merriman, mr. gouvernail, miss mayblunt, mr. merriman, and mademoiselle
reisz next to monsieur ratignolle.

there was something extremely gorgeous about the appearance of the
table, an effect of splendor conveyed by a cover of pale yellow satin
under strips of lace-work. there were wax candles, in massive brass
candelabra, burning softly under yellow silk shades; full, fragrant
roses, yellow and red, abounded. there were silver and gold, as s

€™s stories were always lame and lacking point,
his wife seldom permitted him to complete them. she interrupted him to
ask if he remembered the name of the author whose book she had bought
the week before to send to a friend in geneva. she was talking â€œbooksâ€
 with mr. gouvernail and trying to draw from him his opinion upon current
literary topics. her husband told the story of the waco man privately
to miss mayblunt, who pretended to be greatly amused and to think it
extremely clever.

mrs. highcamp hung with languid but unaffected interest upon the warm
and impetuous volubility of her left-hand neighbor, victor lebrun.
her attention was never for a moment withdrawn from him after seating
herself at table; and when he turned to mrs. merriman, who was prettier
and more vivacious than mrs. highcamp, she waited with easy indifference
for an opportunity to reclaim his attention. there was the occasional
sound of music, of mandolins, sufficiently removed to be an agreeable
accompaniment rather

ld allay.

mademoiselle reisz arose with monsieur ratignolle, who offered to escort
her to the car. she had eaten well; she had tasted the good, rich wines,
and they must have turned her head, for she bowed pleasantly to all
as she withdrew from table. she kissed edna upon the shoulder, and
whispered: â€œbonne nuit, ma reine; soyez sage.â€ she had been a little
bewildered upon rising, or rather, descending from her cushions, and
monsieur ratignolle gallantly took her arm and led her away.

mrs. highcamp was weaving a garland of roses, yellow and red. when she
had finished the garland, she laid it lightly upon victorâ€™s black curls.
he was reclining far back in the luxurious chair, holding a glass of
champagne to the light.

as if a magicianâ€™s wand had touched him, the garland of roses
transformed him into a vision of oriental beauty. his cheeks were the
color of crushed grapes, and his dusky eyes glowed with a languishing
fire.

â€œsapristi!â€ exclaimed arobin.

but mrs. highcamp had one m

â€œoh! to be able to paint in color rather than in words!â€ exclaimed miss
mayblunt, losing herself in a rhapsodic dream as she looked at him.

â€œâ€˜there was a graven image of desire painted with red blood on a ground
of gold.â€™â€ murmured gouvernail, under his breath.

the effect of the wine upon victor was to change his accustomed
volubility into silence. he seemed to have abandoned himself to a
reverie, and to be seeing pleasing visions in the amber bead.

â€œsing,â€ entreated mrs. highcamp. â€œwonâ€™t you sing to us?â€

â€œlet him alone,â€ said arobin.

â€œheâ€™s posing,â€ offered mr. merriman; â€œlet him have it out.â€

â€œi believe heâ€™s paralyzed,â€ laughed mrs. merriman. and leaning over the
youthâ€™s chair, she took the glass from his hand and held it to his lips.
he sipped the wine slowly, and when he had drained the glass she laid it
upon the table and wiped his lips with her little filmy handkerchief.

â€œyes, iâ€™ll sing for you,â€ he said, turning in his chair to

ward mrs.
highcamp. he clasped his hands behind his head, and looking up at the
ceiling began to hum a little, trying his voice like a musician tuning
an instrument. then, looking at edna, he began to sing:

     â€œah! si tu savais!â€

â€œstop!â€ she cried, â€œdonâ€™t sing that. i donâ€™t want you to sing it,â€
 and she laid her glass so impetuously and blindly upon the table as to
shatter it against a carafe. the wine spilled over arobinâ€™s legs and
some of it trickled down upon mrs. highcampâ€™s black gauze gown. victor
had lost all idea of courtesy, or else he thought his hostess was not in
earnest, for he laughed and went on:


     â€œah! si tu savais

     ce que tes yeux me disentâ€--

â€œoh! you mustnâ€™t! you mustnâ€™t,â€ exclaimed edna, and pushing back her
chair she got up, and going behind him placed her hand over his mouth.
he kissed the soft palm that pressed upon his lips.

â€œno, no, i wonâ€™t, mrs. pontellier. i didnâ€™t know you meant it,â€ looking
up at her with

 caressing eyes. the touch of his lips was like a pleasing
sting to her hand. she lifted the garland of roses from his head and
flung it across the room.

â€œcome, victor; youâ€™ve posed long enough. give mrs. highcamp her scarf.â€

mrs. highcamp undraped the scarf from about him with her own hands. miss
mayblunt and mr. gouvernail suddenly conceived the notion that it was
time to say good night. and mr. and mrs. merriman wondered how it could
be so late.

before parting from victor, mrs. highcamp invited him to call upon her
daughter, who she knew would be charmed to meet him and talk french and
sing french songs with him. victor expressed his desire and intention to
call upon miss highcamp at the first opportunity which presented itself.
he asked if arobin were going his way. arobin was not.

the mandolin players had long since stolen away. a profound stillness
had fallen upon the broad, beautiful street. the voices of ednaâ€™s
disbanding guests jarred like a discordant note upon the q

come back and see you; it was very, very imprudent to-day.â€

â€œmind the step!â€ cried edna.

â€œdonâ€™t neglect me,â€ entreated madame ratignolle; â€œand donâ€™t mind what i
said about arobin, or having some one to stay with you.

â€œof course not,â€ edna laughed. â€œyou may say anything you like to me.â€
 they kissed each other good-by. madame ratignolle had not far to go, and
edna stood on the porch a while watching her walk down the street.

then in the afternoon mrs. merriman and mrs. highcamp had made their
â€œparty call.â€ edna felt that they might have dispensed with the
formality. they had also come to invite her to play vingt-et-un one
evening at mrs. merrimanâ€™s. she was asked to go early, to dinner, and
mr. merriman or mr. arobin would take her home. edna accepted in a
half-hearted way. she sometimes felt very tired of mrs. highcamp and
mrs. merriman.

late in the afternoon she sought refuge with mademoiselle reisz, and
stayed there alone, waiting for her, feeling a kind of
