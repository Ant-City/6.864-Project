i can feel my mind begin to race. who is here? what 
do they want? why is my mother so pale? 

"go right in," says the capitol man, who has followed 
me down the hallway. 

i twist the polished brass knob and step inside. my 
nose registers the conflicting scents of roses and 
blood. a small, white-haired man who seems vaguely 
familiar is reading a book. he holds up a finger as if 
to say, "give me a moment." then he turns and my 
heart skips a beat. 

i'm staring into the snakelike eyes of president snow.

in my mind, president snow should be viewed in front 
of marble pillars hung with oversized flags. it's jarring 
to see him surrounded by the ordinary objects in the 
room. like taking the lid off a pot and finding a 
fanged viper instead of stew. 

what could he be doing here? my mind rushes back 
to the opening days of other victory tours. i 
remember seeing the winning tributes with their 
mentors and stylists. even some high governme

if he's made the journey all the way from his city, it 
can only mean one thing. i'm in serious trouble. and 
if i am, so is my family. a shiver goes through me 
when i think of the proximity of my mother and sister 
to this man who despises me. will always despise me. 
because i outsmarted his sadistic hunger games, 
made the capitol look foolish, and consequently 
undermined his control. 

all i was doing was trying to keep peeta and myself

y. so i don't welcome him or offer him a 
chair. i don't say anything. in fact, i treat him as if 
he's a real snake, the venomous kind. i stand 
motionless, my eyes locked on him, considering plans 
of retreat. 

"i think well make this whole situation a lot simpler 
by agreeing not to lie to each other," he says. "what 
do you think?" 

i think my tongue has frozen and speech will be 
impossible, so i surprise myself by answering back in 
a steady voice, "yes, i think that would save time." 

president snow smiles and i notice his lips for the 
first time. i'm expecting snake lips, which is to say 
none. but his are overly full, the skin stretched too 
tight. i have to wonder if his mouth has been altered 
to make him more appealing. if so, it was a waste of 
time and money, because he's not appealing at all. 
"my advisors were concerned you would be difficult, 
but you're not planning on being difficult, are you?" 
he asks. 

"no," i answer. 

"that's what i told them. i said any girl who goes to

lengths to preserve her life isn't going to be 
interested in throwing it away with both hands. and 
then there's her family to think of. her mother, her 
sister, and all those... cousins." by the way he lingers 
on the word "cousins," i can tell he knows that gale 
and i don't share a family tree. 

well, it's all on the table now. maybe that's better. i 
don't do well with ambiguous threats. i'd much rather 
know the score.

"let's sit." president snow takes a seat at the large 
desk of polished wood where prim does her homework 
and my mother her budgets. like our home, this is a 
place that he has no right, but ultimately every right, 
to occupy. i sit in front of the desk on one of the 
carved, straight-backed chairs. it's made for someone 
taller than i am, so only my toes rest on the ground. 

"i have a problem, miss everdeen," says president 
snow. "a problem that began the moment you pulled 
out those poisonous berries in the arena."

the latter. 

"if the head gamemaker, seneca crane, had had any 
brains, he'd have blown you to dust right then. but 
he had an unfortunate sentimental streak. so here 
you are. can you guess where he is?" he asks. 

i nod because, by the way he says it, it's clear that 
seneca crane has been executed. the smell of roses 
and blood has grown stronger now that only a desk 
separates us. there's a rose in president snow's lapel, 
which at least suggests a source of the flower 
perfume, but it must be genetically enhanced, 
because no real rose reeks like that. as for the 
blood... i don't know. 

"after that, there was nothing to do but let you play 
out your little scenario. and you were pretty good, 
too, with the love-crazed schoolgirl bit. the people in 
the capitol were quite convinced. unfortunately, not 
everyone in the districts fell for your act," he says.

. and if a girl from district twelve of all places 
can defy the capitol and walk away unharmed, what 
is to stop them from doing the same?" he says. "what 
is to prevent, say, an uprising?" 

it takes a moment for his last sentence to sink in. 
then the full weight of it hits me. "there have been 
uprisings?" i ask, both chilled and somewhat elated 
by the possibility. 

"not yet. but they'll follow if the course of things 
doesn't change. and uprisings have been known to 
lead to revolution." president snow rubs a spot over 
his left eyebrow, the very spot where i myself get 
headaches. "do you have any idea what that would 
mean? how many people would die? what conditions 
those left would have to face? whatever problems 
anyone may have with the capitol, believe me when i 
say that if it released its grip on the districts for even 
a short time, the entire system would collapse." 

i'm taken aback by the directness and even the 
sincerity of this speech. as if his primary concern is 
the welfare

my mother sets the tray on the desk. it holds a china 
teapot and cups, cream and sugar, and a plate of 
cookies. they are beautifully iced with softly colored 
flowers. the frosting work can only be peeta's. 

"what a welcome sight. you know, it's funny how 
often people forget that presidents need to eat, too," 
president snow says charmingly. well, it seems to 
relax my mother a bit, anyway. 

"can i get you anything else? i can cook something 
more substantial if you're hungry," she offers. 

"no, this could not be more perfect. thank you," he 
says, clearly dismissing her. my mother nods, shoots 
me a glance, and goes. president snow pours tea for 
both of us and fills his with cream and sugar, then 
takes a long time stirring. i sense he has had his say

conversation, at discussing my feelings for two of the

people i care most about with president snow, chokes 
me off. 



"speak, miss everdeen. him i can easily kill off if we 
don't come to a happy resolution," he says. "you 
aren't doing him a favor by disappearing into the 
woods with him each sunday." 

if he knows this, what else does he know? and how 
does he know it? many people could tell him that gale 
and i spend our sundays hunting. don't we show up 
at the end of each one loaded down with game? 
haven't we for years? the real question is what he

impossible. at least by a person. cameras? that 
never crossed my mind until this moment. the woods 
have always been our place of safety, our place 
beyond the reach of the capitol, where we're free to 
say what we feel, be who we are. at least before the 
games. if we've been watched since, what have they 
seen? two people hunting, saying treasonous things 
against the capitol, yes. but not two people in love, 
which seems to be president snow's implication. we 
are safe on that charge. unless... unless... 

it only happened once. it was fast and unexpected, 
but it did happen. 

after peeta and i got home from the games, it was 
several weeks before i saw gale alone. first there 
were the obligatory celebrations. a banquet for the 
victors that only the most high-ranking people were 
invited to. a holiday for the whole district with free 
food and entertainers brought in from the capitol.

marrying, but i didn't end up using it. gale acted as if 
the kiss had never happened. 

maybe he was waiting for me to say something. or 
kiss him back. instead i just pretended it had never 
happened, either. but it had. gale had shattered 
some invisible barrier between us and, with it, any 
hope i had of resuming our old, uncomplicated 
friendship. whatever i pretended, i could never look 
at his lips in quite the same way. 

this all flashes through my head in an instant as 
president snow's eyes bore into me on the heels of his 
threat to kill gale. how stupid i've been to think the 
capitol would just ignore me once i'd returned home! 
maybe i didn't know about the potential uprisings. 
but i knew they were angry with me. instead of acting 
with the extreme caution the situation called for, 
what have i done? from the president's point of view, 
i've ignored peeta and flaunted my preference for 
gale's company before the whole district. and by 
doing so made it clear i was, in

"please don't hurt gale," i whisper. "he's just my

between us. besides, everyone thinks we're cousins 
now." 

"i'm only interested in how it affects your dynamic 
with peeta, thereby affecting the mood in the 
districts," he says. 

"it will be the same on the tour. ill be in love with him 
just as i was," i say. 

"just as you are," corrects president snow. 
"just as i am," i confirm. 

"only youll have to do even better if the uprisings are 
to be averted," he says. "this tour will be your only 
chance to turn things around." 

"i know. i will. ill convince everyone in the districts 
that i wasn't defying the capitol, that i was crazy with 
love," i say. 

president snow rises and dabs his puffy lips with a 
napkin. "aim higher in case you fall short."

still holds peeta's beautiful cookie. i think it had a 
tiger lily on it, but now it's been reduced to crumbs in 
my fist. i didn't even know i was crushing it, but i 
guess i had to hold on to something while my world

when my hair is done, i find cinna downstairs in the 
living room, and just the sight of him makes me feel 
more hopeful. he looks the same as always, simple 
clothes, short brown hair, just a hint of gold eyeliner. 
we embrace, and i can barely keep from spilling out 
the entire episode with president snow. but no, i've 
decided to tell haymitch first. he'll know best who to 
burden with it. it's so easy to talk to cinna, though. 
lately we've been speaking a lot on the telephone that 
came with the house. it's sort of a joke, because 
almost no one else we know owns one. there's peeta, 
but obviously i don't call him. haymitch tore his out 
of the wall years ago. my friend madge, the mayor's 
daughter, has a telephone in her house, but if we 
want to talk, we do it in person. at first, the thing

f course, but the pain is so real i take a 
step back. i squeeze my eyes shut and i don't see 
prim â€” i see rue, the twelve-year-old girl from district 
1 1 who was my ally in the arena. she could fly, 
birdlike, from tree to tree, catching on to the 
slenderest branches. rue, who i didn't save. who i let 
die. i picture her lying on the ground with the spear 
still wedged in her stomach... 

who else will i fail to save from the capitol's 
vengeance? who else will be dead if i don't satisfy 
president snow? 

i realize cinna's trying to put a coat on me, so i raise 
my arms. i feel fur, inside and out, encasing me. it's 
from no animal i've ever seen. "ermine," he tells me 
as i stroke the white sleeve. leather gloves. a bright 
red scarf. something furry covers my ears. "you're 
bringing earmuffs back in style." 

/ hate earmuffs, i think. they make it hard to hear, 
and since i was blasted deaf in one ear in the arena, i 
dislike them even more. after i won, the capitol

their marvelous trip. all right, katniss, big smile, 
you're very excited, right?" i don't exaggerate when i 
say she shoves me out the door. 

for a moment i can't quite see right because of the 
snow, which is now coming down in earnest. then i 
make out peeta coming through his front door. in my 
head i hear president snow's directive, "convince me." 
and i know i must. 

my face breaks into a huge smile and i start walking 
in peeta's direction. then, as if i can't stand it 
another second, i start running. he catches me and 
spins me around and then he slips â€” he still isn't 
entirely in command of his artificial leg â€” and we fall 
into the snow, me on top of him, and that's where we 
have our first kiss in months. it's full of fur and

before he answers, scowling, as if he's certain i've 
brought bad news. 

"what do you want?" he says, nearly knocking me out 
with a cloud of wine fumes. 

"i have to talk to you," i whisper. 

"now?" he says. i nod. "this better be good." he waits, 
but i feel certain every word we utter on a capitol 
train is being recorded. "well?" he barks. 

the train starts to brake and for a second i think 
president snow is watching me and doesn't approve 
of my confiding in haymitch and has decided to go 
ahead and kill me now. but we're just stopping for 
fuel. 

"the train's so stuffy," i say. 

it's a harmless phrase, but i see haymitch's eyes 
narrow in understanding. "i know what you need." he 
pushes past me and lurches down the hall to a door. 
when he wrestles it open, a blast of snow hits us. he 
trips out onto the ground.

just crawl between the covers of my bed in my

about my conversation with haymitch. everything he 
said was true about the capitol's expectations, my 
future with peeta, even his last comment. of course, i 
could do a lot worse than peeta. that isn't really the 
point, though, is it? one of the few freedoms we have 
in district 12 is the right to marry who we want or not 
marry at all. and now even that has been taken away 
from me. i wonder if president snow will insist we 
have children. if we do, theyll have to face the 
reaping each year. and wouldn't it be something to 
see the child of not one but two victors chosen for the 
arena? victors' children have been in the ring before. 
it always causes a lot of excitement and generates 
talk about how the odds are not in that family's favor. 
but it happens too frequently to just be about odds.

the drawings to add extra drama. given all the

alternative? i had a taste of that alternative when they 
called prim's name on reaping day and i watched her 
walk to the stage to her death. but as her sister i 
could take her place, an option forbidden to our 
mother. 

my mind searches frantically for a way out. i can't let 
president snow condemn me to this. even if it means 
taking my own life. before that, though, i'd try to run 
away. what would they do if i simply vanished? 
disappeared into the woods and never came out? 
could i even manage to take everyone i love with me, 
start a new life deep in the wild? highly unlikely but 
not impossible. 

i shake my head to clear it. this is not the time to be 
making wild escape plans. i must focus on the victory 
tour. too many people's fates depend on my giving a

tattoo my breasts? dye my skin magenta and implant

really have no idea how freakish they look to the rest 
of us?

all my friends are probably going to end up dead, but

his offer does make me feel better. less duplicitous 
somehow. it would be nice if he'd come to me with 
this earlier, before i knew that president snow had 
other plans and just being friends was not an option 
for us anymore. but either way, i'm glad we're 
speaking again.

intentional â€” i only meant to express my thanks â€” but 
i have elicited something dangerous. an act of dissent

haymitch?" 

"it will be better coming from you," haymitch says to 
me.

i don't agree. i think it will be a hundred times worse 
coming from me. but i tell peeta everything as calmly 
as i can. about president snow, the unrest in the 
districts. i don't even omit the kiss with gale. i lay out 
how we are all in jeopardy, how the whole country is 
in jeopardy because of my trick with the berries. "i 
was supposed to fix things on this tour. make 
everyone who had doubted believe i acted out of love. 
calm things down. but obviously, all i've done today 
is. get three people killed, and now everyone in the

"oh" is all i can think to say. 

"you'll see, the choices you'll have to make. if we 
survive this," says haymitch. "youll learn." 

well, i've learned one thing today. this place is not a 
larger version of district 12. our fence is unguarded 
and rarely charged. our peacekeepers are unwelcome 
but less brutal. our hardships evoke more fatigue 
than fury. here in 1 1 , they suffer more acutely and 
feel more desperation. president snow is right. a 
spark could be enough to set them ablaze. 

everything is happening too fast for me to process it. 
the warning, the shootings, the recognition that i 
may have set something of great consequence in 
motion. the whole thing is so improbable. and it 
would be one thing if i had planned to stir things up, 
but given the circumstances... how on earth did i 
cause so much trouble?

knee, pours out his heart, and begs me to marry him. 
i, of course, accept. caesar is beside himself, the

president snow himself makes a surprise visit to 
congratulate us. he clasps peeta's hand and gives 
him an approving slap on the shoulder. he embraces 
me, enfolding me in the smell of blood and roses, and 
plants a puffy kiss on my cheek. when he pulls back, 
his fingers digging into my arms, his face smiling into 
mine, i dare to raise my eyebrows. they ask what my

that i have some genuine happiness at our 
engagement. his eyes reflect his puzzlement but only

and she escorts us around to say good-bye to 
important people, then herds us to the door. 

"shouldn't we thank president snow?" asks peeta. 
"it's his house." 

"oh, he's not a big one for parties. too busy," says 
effie. "i've already arranged for the necessary notes 
and gifts to be sent to him tomorrow. there you are!" 
effie gives a little wave to two capitol attendants who 
have an inebriated haymitch propped up between 
them.

district 8. i recognize it because i was there only last 
week. there are still banners with my face waving 
from the rooftops. below them, there's a mob scene. 
the square's packed with screaming people, their 
faces hidden with rags and homemade masks, 
throwing bricks. buildings burn. peacekeepers shoot 
into the crowd, killing at random. 

i've never seen anything like it, but i can only be 
witnessing one thing. this is what president snow 
calls an uprising.

pair of fur-lined gloves that cinna left behind. three

will not accept because of his anger at me. i know 
exactly how he feels. didn't i do the same thing to my 
mother? 

i look in his eyes. his temper can't quite mask the 
hurt, the sense of betrayal he feels at my engagement 
to peeta. this will be my last chance, this meeting 
today, to not lose gale forever. i could take hours 
trying to explain, and even then have him refuse me. 
instead i go straight to the heart of my defense. 

"president snow personally threatened to have you 
killed," i say. 

gale raises his eyebrows slightly, but there's no real 
show of fear or astonishment. "anyone else?" 

"well, he didn't actually give me a copy of the list. but 
it's a good guess it includes both our families," i say. 

it's enough to bring him to the fire. he crouches 
before the hearth and warms himself. "unless what?"

gloves, flexes his fingers, and nods in approval. "at 
least i'll die in comfort." 

"that's optimistic. of course, you don't know what's 
happened," i say. 

"let's have it," he says. 

i decide to begin with the night peeta and i were 
crowned victors of the hunger games, and haymitch 
warned me of the capitol's fury. i tell him about the 
uneasiness that dogged me even once i was back 
home, president snow's visit to my house, the 
murders in district 1 1, the tension in the crowds, the 
last-ditch effort of the engagement, the president's 
indication that it hadn't been enough, my certainty 
that 111 have to pay.

gloves in his pocket and occupies himself with 
turning the food in the leather bag into a meal for us.

into the night finishing up laundry. i could go then, 
tap at the window, tell her the situation so she'll keep 
gale from doing anything foolish. 

my conversation with president snow in the study 
comes back to me. 

"my advisors were concerned you would be difficult, 
but you're not planning on being difficult at all, are 
you?" 

"no. " 

"that's what i told them. i said any girl who goes to 
such lengths to preserve her life isn't going to be 
interested in throwing it away with both hands. " 

i think of how hard hazelle has worked to keep that

le use. it's a safe 
enough place to talk. but i can't seem to get the 
words out. proposing it to gale was such a disaster. i 
gnaw on my chapped lips. the square gets closer with 
every step. i may not have an opportunity again soon. 
i take a deep breath and let the words rush out. 
"peeta, if i asked you to run away from the district 
with me, would you?" 

peeta takes my arm, bringing me to a stop. he doesn't 
need to check my face to see if i'm serious. "depends 
on why you're asking." 

"president snow wasn't convinced by me. there's an 
uprising in district eight. we have to get out," i say. 

"by \ve' do you mean just you and me? no. who else 
would be going?" he asks. 

"my family. yours, if they want to come. haymitch, 
maybe," i say. 

"what about gale?" he says. 

"i don't know. he might have other plans," i say. 

peeta shakes his head and gives me a rueful smile. "i 
bet he does. sure, katniss, i'll go." 

i feel a slight twinge of hope. "you will?"

gale begins stirring at my voice, trying to reach me. 
the movement causes fresh blood to stain his 
bandages and an agonized sound to come from his 
mouth. 

"take her out," says my mother. haymitch and peeta 
literally carry me from the room while i shout 
obscenities at her. they pin me down on a bed in one 
of the extra bedrooms until i stop fighting. 

while i lie there, sobbing, tears trying to squeeze out 
of the slit of my eye, i hear peeta whisper to haymitch 
about president snow, about the uprising in district

has an opinion on this, he doesn't offer it. 

after a while, my mother comes in and treats my face. 
then she holds my hand, stroking my arm, while 
haymitch fills her in on what happened with gale. 

"so it's starting again?" she says. "like before?" 

"by the looks of it," he answers. "who'd have thought 
we'd ever be sorry to see old cray go?"

no wonder i won the games. no decent person ever

you saved peeta, i think weakly. 

but now i question even that. i knew good and well 
that my life back in district 12 would be unlivable if i 
let that boy die. 

i rest my head forward on the edge of the table, 
overcome with loathing for myself. wishing i had died 
in the arena. wishing seneca crane had blown me to 
bits the way president snow said he should have 
when i held out the berries. 

the berries. i realize the answer to who i am lies in 
that handful of poisonous fruit. if i held them out to 
save peeta because i knew i would be shunned if i 
came back without him, then i am despicable. if i 
held them out because i loved him, i am still self- 
centered, although forgivable. but if i held them out 
to defy the capitol, i am someone of worth. the 
trouble is, i don't know exactly what was going on 
inside me at that moment.

"he went home when we heard you stirring. didn't 
want to leave his house unattended during the 
storm," says my mother. 

"did he get back all right?" i ask. in a blizzard, you 
can get lost in a matter of yards and wander off 
course into oblivion. 

"why don't you give him a call and check?" she says. 

i go into the study, a room i've pretty much avoided 
since my meeting with president snow, and dial 
peeta's number. after a few rings he answers. 

"hey. i just wanted to make sure you got home," i 
say. 

"katniss, i live three houses away from you," he says.

sick and dying, the bleeding backs, the gaunt-faced 
children, the marching boots, or the omnipresent 
misery that drives me under the fence. it's the arrival 
of a crate of wedding dresses one night with a note 
from effie saying that president snow approved these 
himself. 

the wedding. is he really planning to go through with 
it? what, in his twisted brain, will that achieve? is it 
for the benefit of those in the capitol? a wedding was 
promised, a wedding will be given. and then he'll kill 
us? as a lesson to the districts? i don't know. i can't

"i know. i know. since i pulled out those berries," i 
say tiredly. 

i hardly notice the walk home even though a wet 
snow begins to fall. my mind is spinning with new 
information about the uprising in district 8 and the 
unlikely but tantalizing possibility of district 13. 

listening to bonnie and twill confirmed one thing: 
president snow has been playing me for a fool. all the 
kisses and endearments in the world couldn't have 
derailed the momentum building up in district 8. yes, 
my holding out the berries had been the spark, but i 
had no way to control the fire. he must have known 
that. so why visit my home, why order me to 
persuade the crowd of my love for peeta? 

it was obviously a ploy to distract me and keep me 
from doing anything else inflammatory in the 
districts. and to entertain the people in the capitol, of

i thought no one saw me sneak under the fence, but 
who knows? there are always eyes for hire. someone 
reported gale kissing me in that very spot. still, that 
was in daylight and before i was more careful about 
my behavior. could there be surveillance cameras? 
i've wondered about this before. is this the way

when i went under and my face was bundled in a 
scarf. but the list of suspects likely to be trespassing 
into the woods is probably very short. 

my eyes peer through the trees, past the fence, into 
the meadow. all i can see is the wet snow illuminated 
here and there by the light from the windows on the 
edge of the seam. no peacekeepers in sight, no signs i 
am being hunted. whether thread knows i left the

will figure out how i got back in and arrest me. it's 
funny, because he could just arrest me, anyway, 
based on past crimes, but maybe he has to have 
something really irrefutable to do it, now that i'm a 
victor. and i wonder if president snow's in contact 
with thread. i think it's unlikely he ever

levision, but then caesar is telling us to stay tuned 
for the other big event of the evening. "that's right, 
this year will be the seventy-fifth anniversary of the 
hunger games, and that means it's time for our third 
quarter quell!" 

"what will they do?" asks prim. "it isn't for months

and distant, as if she's remembering something. "it 
must be the reading of the card." 

the anthem plays, and my throat tightens with 
revulsion as president snow takes the stage. he's 
followed by a young boy dressed in a white suit, 
holding a simple wooden box. the anthem ends, and 
president snow begins to speak, to remind us all of 
the dark days from which the hunger games were 
born. when the laws for the games were laid out,

they dictated that every twenty-five years the 
anniversary would be marked by a quarter quell. it 
would call for a glorified version of the games to make

memory of those killed by the districts' 
rebellion. 

these words could not be more pointed, since i 
suspect several districts are rebelling right now. 

president snow goes on to tell us what happened in 
the previous quarter quells. "on the twenty-fifth 
anniversary, as a reminder to the rebels that their 
children were dying because of their choice to initiate 
violence, every district was made to hold an election 
and vote on the tributes who would represent it." 

i wonder how that would have felt. picking the kids 
who had to go. it is worse, i think, to be turned over 
by your own neighbors than have your name drawn 
from the reaping ball.

there's some kind of sheeting, the kind they put 
down when they paint. i pull it over me like a blanket. 
in the distance, someone is calling my name. but at 
the moment, i excuse myself from thinking about 
even those i love most. i think only of me. and what 
lies ahead. 

the sheeting's stiff but holds warmth. my muscles 
relax, my heart rate slows. i see the wooden box in 
the little boy's hands, president snow drawing out the 
yellowed envelope. is it possible that this was really 
the quarter quell written down seventy-five years 
ago? it seems unlikely. it's just too perfect an answer 
for the troubles that face the capitol today. getting 
rid of me and subduing the districts all in one neat 
little package. 

i hear president snow's voice in my head. "on the

that even the strongest among them cannot overcome

"you and me. that's who he plans on coming home," i 
say. 

"well, then the joke's on him," says haymitch. 

but after a few days, we agree to act like careers, 
because this is the best way to get peeta ready as 
well. every night we watch the old recaps of the 
games that the remaining victors won. i realize we 
never met any of them on the victory tour, which 
seems odd in retrospect. when i bring it up, 
haymitch says the last thing president snow would've 
wanted was to show peeta and me â€” especially me â€” 
bonding with other victors in potentially rebellious 
districts. victors have a special status, and if they 
appeared to be supporting my defiance of the capitol, 
it would've been dangerous politically. adjusting for 
age, i realize some of our opponents may be elderly, 
which is both sad and reassuring. peeta takes 
copious notes, haymitch volunteers information 
about the victors' personalities, and slowly we begin 
to know our

feel weird. it seems like some major invasion of 
haymitch's privacy. i don't know why it should, since 
the whole thing was public. but it does. i have to 
admit i'm also extremely curious. "we don't have to 
tell haymitch we saw it." 

"okay," peeta agrees. he puts in the tape and i curl 
up next to him on the couch with my milk, which is 
really delicious with the honey and spices, and lose 
myself in the fiftieth hunger games. after the 
anthem, they show president snow drawing the 
envelope for the second quarter quell. he looks 
younger but just as repellent. he reads from the 
square of paper in the same onerous voice he used for 
ours, informing panem that in honor of the quarter 
quell, there will be twice the number of tributes. the 
editors smash cut right into the reapings, where 
name after name after name is called. 

by the time we get to district 12, i'm completely 
overwhelmed by the sheer number of kids going to 
certain death. there's a woman, n

particularly riveting to the pair from district 6, who 
are known morphling addicts. both bone thin, with 
sagging yellowish skin. they can't tear their overlarge 
eyes away, even when president snow begins to speak 
from his balcony, welcoming us all to the quell. the 
anthem plays, and as we make our final trip around 
the circle, am i wrong? or do i see the president 
fixated on me as well? 

peeta and i wait until the doors of the training center 
have closed behind us to relax. cinna and portia are

he somehow ended up at the end of the noose," i say.

of the sort then, but i hadn't understood what he

going to try. to get you home, i mean. but if i'm 
perfectly honest about it..." 

"if you're perfectly honest about it, you think 
president snow has probably given them direct orders 
to make sure we die in the arena anyway," i say. 

"it's crossed my mind," says peeta.

know 111 never leave that arena alive, i'm still holding 
on to the hope that peeta will. after all, he didn't pull 
out those berries, i did. no one has ever doubted that 
peeta's defiance was motivated by love. so maybe 
president snow will prefer keeping him alive, crushed 
and heartbroken, as a living warning to o

"but even if that happens, everyone will know we've

distance myself from the personal tragedy that has 
consumed me since they announced the quell. i 
remember the old man they shot in district 1 1 , and 
bonnie and twill, and the rumored uprisings. yes, 
everyone in the districts will be watching me to see 
how i handle this death sentence, this final act of 
president snow's dominance. they will be looking for 
some sign that their battles have not been in vain. if i 
can make it clear that i'm still defying the capitol 
right up to the end, the capitol will have killed me... 
but not my spirit. what better way to give hope to the 
rebels?

my prep team. my foolish, shallow, affectionate pets, 
with their obsessions with feathers and parties, 
nearly break my heart with their good-bye. it's certain 
from venia's last words that we all know i won't be 
returning. does the whole world know it? i wonder. i 
look at cinna. he knows, certainly. but as he 
promised, there's no danger of tears from him. 

"so, what am i wearing tonight?" i ask, eyeing the 
garment bag that holds my dress. 

"president snow put in the dress order himself," says 
cinna. he unzips the bag, revealing one of the 
wedding dresses i wore for the photo shoot. heavy 
white silk with a low neckline and tight waist and 
sleeves that fall from my wrists to the floor. and 
pearls. everywhere pearls. stitched into the dress and 
in ropes at my throat and forming the crown for the 
veil. "even though they announced the quarter quell

i rub a bit of the silk between my fingers, trying to 
figure out president snow's reasoning. i suppose 
since i was the greatest offender, my pain and loss 
and humiliation should be in the brightest spotlight. 
this, he thinks, will make that clear. it's so barbaric, 
the president turning my bridal gown into my shroud, 
that the blow strikes home, leaving me with a dull 
ache inside. "well, it'd be a shame to waste such a 
pretty dress" is all i say. 

cinna helps me carefully into the gown. as it settles 
on my shoulders, they can't help giving a shrug of 
complaint. "w

"no, this year i'm just winging it. the funny thing is, 
i'm not nervous at all." and i'm not. however much 
president snow may hate me, this capitol audience is 
mine. 

we meet up with effie, haymitch, portia, and peeta at 
the elevator. peeta's in an elegant tuxedo and white 
gloves. the sort of thing grooms wear to get married 
in, here in the capitol. 

back home everything is so much simpler. a woman 
usually rents a white dress that's been worn 
hundreds of times. the man wears something clean 
that's not mining clothes. they fill out some forms at

no one really feels married in district 12 until after 
the toasting. 

the other tributes have already gathered offstage and 
are talking softly, but when peeta and i arrive, they 
fall silent. i realize everyone's staring daggers at my 
wedding dress. are they jealous of its beauty? the 
power it might have to manipulate the crowd? 

finally finnick says, "i can't believe cinna put you in 
that thing." 

"he didn't have any choice. president snow made

criticize cinna.

brother's hand and pulls him into place to lead our 
procession onto the stage. the other tributes begin to 
line up as well. i'm confused because, while they all 
are angry, some are giving us sympathetic pats on the 
shoulder, and johanna mason actually stops to

m pay for it, okay?" she says. 

i nod, but i don't know what she means. not until 
we're all sitting out onstage and caesar flickerman, 
hair and face highlighted in lavender this year, has 
done his opening spiel and the tributes begin their 
interviews. this is the first time i realize the depth of 
betrayal felt among the victors and the rage that 
accompanies it. but they are so smart, so wonderfully 
smart about how they play it, because it all comes 
back to reflect on the government and president snow 
in particular. not everyone. there are the old 
throwbacks, like brutus and enobaria, who are just 
here for another games, and those too baffled or 
drugged or lost to join in on the attack. but there are 
enough victors who still have the wits and the nerve 
to come out fighting.

how she just can't stop crying when she thinks of how 
much the people in the capitol must be suffering 
because they will lose us. gloss recalls the kindness

is one true 
love in the capitol, and about a hundred people faint 
because they're sure he means them. by the time 
johanna mason gets up, she's asking if something 
can't be done about the situation. surely the creators 
of the quarter quell never anticipated such love 
forming between the victors and the capitol. no one

could be so cruel as to sever such a deep bond. 
seeder quietly ruminates about how, back in district 
11, everyone assumes president snow is all-powerful. 
so if he's all-powerful, why doesn't he change the 
quell? and chaff, who comes right on her heels, 
insists the president could change the quell if he 
wanted to, but he must not think it matters much to 
anyone. 

by the time i'm introduced, the audience is an 
absolute wreck. people have been weeping and 
collapsing and even calling for change. the sight of 
me in my white silk bridal gown practically causes a 
riot. no more me, no more star-crossed lovers living 
happily e

hink you better 
take a bow!" caesar gestures for cinna to rise. he 
does, and makes a small, gracious bow. and suddenly 
i am so afraid for him. what has he done? something 
terribly dangerous. an act of rebellion in itself. and 
he's done it for me. i remember his words... 

"don't worry. i always channel my emotions into my 
work. that way i don't hurt anyone but myself. " 

...and i'm afraid he has hurt himself beyond repair. 
the significance of my fiery transformation will not be 
lost on president snow. 

the audience, who's been stunned into silence, 

breaks into wild applause. i can barely hear the

buzzer that indicates that my three minutes are up. 
caesar thanks me and i go back to my seat, my dress 
now feeling lighter than air. 

as i pass peeta, who's headed for his interview, he 
doesn't meet my eyes. i take my seat carefully, but 
aside from the puffs of smoke here and there, i seem 
unharmed, so i turn my attention to him.

ut move where? 

i can't think straight. the image of cinna, beaten and 
bloody, consumes me. where is he now? what are 
they doing to him? torturing him? killing him? 
turning him into an avox? obviously his assault was 
staged to unhinge me, the same way darius's 
presence in my quarters was. and it has unhinged 
me. all i want to do is collapse on my metal plate. but 
i can hardly do that after what i just witnessed. i 
must be strong. i owe it to cinna, who risked 
everything by undermining president snow and 
turning my bridal silk into mockingjay plumage. and i 
owe it to the rebels who, emboldened by cinna's 
example, might be fighting to bring down the capitol 
at this moment. my refusal to play the games on the 
capitol's terms is to be my last act of rebellion. so i 
grit my teeth and will myself to be a player. 

where are you? i can still make no sense of my 
surroundings. where are you?! i demand an answer 
from myself and slowly the world comes into focus.

"yes. do you mind that i used your mockingjay? i

"no, of course i don't mind." i force a smile. peeta 
showing up in the arena wearing a mockingjay is both

a blessing and a curse. on the one hand, it should 
give a boost to the rebels in the district. on the other, 
it's hard to imagine president snow will overlook it, 
and that makes the job of keeping peeta alive harder. 

"so you want to make camp here, then?" finnick 
asks. 

"i don't think that's an option," peeta answers. 
"staying here. with no water. no protection. i feel all 
right, really. if we could just go slowly." 

"slowly would be better than not at all." finnick helps 
peeta to his feet while i pull myself together. since i 
got up this morning i've watched cinna beaten to a 
pulp, landed in another arena, and seen peeta die

think i can do it personally. not after all he's done for 
peeta. i think about maneuvering him into some kind 
of encounter with the careers. it's cold, i know. but 
what are my options? now that we know about the 
clock, he probably won't die in the jungle, so 
someone's going to have to kill him in battle. 

because this is so repellent to think about, my mind 
frantically tries to change topics. but the only thing 
that distracts me from my current situation is 
fantasizing about killing president snow. not very 
pretty daydreams for a seventeen-year-old girl, i 
guess, but very satisfying. 

we walk down the nearest sand strip, approaching 
the cornucopia with care, just in case the careers are 
concealed there. i doubt they are, because we've been 
on the beach for hours and there's been no sign of 
life. the area's abandoned, as i expected. only the big

colored blossoms of light. i can't think why the sky's 
being bombed until i realize the gamemakers are 
shooting off fireworks up there, while the real 
destruction occurs on the ground. just in case it's 
not enough fun watching the obliteration of the arena 
and the remaining tributes. or perhaps to illuminate 
our gory ends. 

will they let anyone survive? will there be a victor of 
the seventy-fifth hunger games? maybe not. after all, 
what is this quarter quell but... what was it 
president snow read from the card? 

"...a reminder to the rebels that even the strongest 
among them cannot overcome the power of the 
capitol. . . " 

not even the strongest of the strong will triumph. 
perhaps they never intended to have a victor in these 
games at all. or perhaps my final act of rebellion 
forced their hand. 

i'm sorry, peeta, i think. i'm sorry i couldn't save you. 
save him? more likely i stole his last chance at life, 
condemned him, by destroying the force field. maybe, 
if we had al

"i wish she was dead," he says. "i wish they were all 
dead and we were, too. it would be best." 

well, there's no good response to that. i can hardly 
dispute it since i was walking around with a syringe 
to kill peeta when i found them. do i really want him 
dead? what i want... what i want is to have him back.

but i'll never get him back now. even if the rebel 
forces could somehow overthrow the capitol, you can 
be sure president snow's last act would be to cut 
peeta's throat. no. i will never get him back. so then 
dead is best. 

but will peeta know that or will he keep fighting? he's 
so strong and such a good liar. does he think he has 
a chance of surviving? does he even care if he does? 
he wasn't planning on it, anyway. he had already 
signed off on life. maybe, if he knows i was rescued, 
he's even happy. feels he fulfilled his mission to keep 
me alive. 

i think i hate him even more than i do haymitch.
