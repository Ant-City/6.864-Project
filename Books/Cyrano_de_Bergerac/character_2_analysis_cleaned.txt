christian represents the other half of the romantic hero. he operates as cyrano’s spokesman and comes to represent the shallowness of outer beauty. his good looks and charm tend to overshadow his lingering shyness, waning creativity, and eloquence. christian’s needs and desires are simple and clear compared to cyrano’s more complex motivations and goals. yet there is an undeniable, human source to christian’s deeper emotions and feelings. he is a legitimate lover, but he has no talents to express his love. christian proves to be rather average in all but his striking physical attractiveness.
