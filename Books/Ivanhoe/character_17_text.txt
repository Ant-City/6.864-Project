useful to assist the reader in comprehending
the characters of the jew, the templar, the captain of the mercenaries,
or free companions, as they were called, and others proper to the
period, are added, but with a sparing hand, since sufficient information
on these subjects is to be found in general history.

an incident in the tale, which had the good fortune to find favour in
the eyes of many readers, is more directly borrowed from the stores of
old romance. i mean the meeting of the king with friar tuck at the cell
of that buxom hermit. the general tone of the story belongs to all ranks
and all countries, which emulate each other in describing the rambles of
a disguised sovereign, who, going in search of information or amusement,
into the lower ranks of life, meets with adventures diverting to the
reader or hearer, from the contrast betwixt the monarchâ€™s outward
appearance, and his real character. the eastern tale-teller has for his
theme the disguised expeditions of haroun alraschid wi

volume, entitled â€œancient metrical tales, printed chiefly from original

similarity to the meeting of king richard and friar tuck.

king edward (we are not told which among the monarchs of that name, but,
from his temper and habits, we may suppose edward iv.) sets forth with
his court to a gallant hunting-match in sherwood forest, in which, as
is not unusual for princes in romance, he falls in with a deer of
extraordinary size and swiftness, and pursues it closely, till he has
outstripped his whole retinue, tired out hounds and horse, and finds
himself alone under the gloom of an extensive forest, upon which

f procuring some venison. the hermit replies, by once more
insisting on the duties incumbent upon him as a churchman, and continues
to affirm himself free from all such breaches of order:

     â€œmany day i have here been,
     and flesh-meat i eat never,
     but milk of the kye;
     warm thee well, and go to sleep,
     and i will lap thee with my cope,
     softly to lye.â€

it would seem that the manuscript is here imperfect, for we do not find
the reasons which finally induce the curtal friar to amend the kingâ€™s
cheer. but acknowledging his guest to be such a â€œgood fellowâ€ as has
seldom graced his board, the holy man at length produces the best his
cell affords. two candles are placed on a table, white bread and baked
pasties are displayed by the light, besides choice of venison, both salt
and fresh, from which they select collops. â€œi might have eaten my bread
dry,â€ said the king, â€œhad i not pressed thee on the score of archery,
but now have i dined like a prince--if we

this too is afforded by the hospitable anchorite, who dispatches an
assistant to fetch a pot of four gallons from a secret corner near his
bed, and the whole three set in to serious drinking. this amusement
is superintended by the friar, according to the recurrence of certain
fustian words, to be repeated by every compotator in turn before he
drank--a species of high jinks, as it were, by which they regulated
their potations, as toasts were given in latter times. the one toper
says â€œfusty bandiasâ€, to which the other is obliged to reply, â€œstrike
pantnereâ€, and the friar passes many jests on the kingâ€™s want of memory,
who sometimes forgets the words of action. the night is spent in this
jolly pastime. before his depar

espect due to his sovereign, while incognito, is agreeably surprised by
receiving honours and reward.

in mr hartshorneâ€™s collection, there is a romance on the same
foundation, called king edward and the shepherd, [4]

which, considered as illustrating manners, is still more curious than
the king and the hermit; but it is foreign to the present purpose.
the reader has here the original legend from which the incident in the
romance is derived; and the identifying the irregular eremite with the
friar tuck of robin hoodâ€™s story, was an obvious expedient.

the name of ivanhoe was suggested by an old rhyme. all novelists have
had occasion at some time or other to wish with falstaff, that they knew
where a commodity of good names was to be had. on such an occasion the
author chanced to call to memory a rhyme recording three names of the
manors forfeited by the ancestor of the celebrated hampden, for striking
the black prince a blow with his racket, when they quarrelled at tennis:

the knight (whose brain began to be heated with these
repeated draughts) qualified his flagon from the water pitcher.

â€œwhy,â€ said the knight, â€œdid you not tell me that this water was from
the well of your blessed patron, st dunstan?â€

â€œay, truly,â€ said the hermit, â€œand many a hundred of pagans did he
baptize there, but i never heard that he drank any of it. every thing
should be put to its proper use in this world. st dunstan knew, as well
as any one, the prerogatives of a jovial friar.â€

and so saying, he reached the harp, and entertained his guest with
the following characteristic song, to a sort of derry-down chorus,
appropriate to an old english ditty. [24]


     the barefooted friar.

     1.

     iâ€™ll give thee, good fellow, a twelvemonth or twain,
     to search europe through, from byzantium to spain;
     but neâ€™er shall you find, should you search till you tire,
     so happy a man as the barefooted friar.

     2.

     your knight for his lady pricks forth

     i confess him in haste--for his lady desires
     no comfort on earth save the barefooted friarâ€™s.

     3.

     your monarch?--pshaw! many a prince has been known
     to barter his robes for our cowl and our gown,
     but which of us eâ€™er felt the idle desire
     to exchange for a crown the grey hood of a friar!

     4.

     the friar has walkâ€™d out, and whereâ€™er he has gone,
     the land and its fatness is markâ€™d for his own;
     he can roam where he lists, he can stop when he tires,
     for every manâ€™s house is the barefooted friarâ€™s.

     5.

     heâ€™s expected at noon, and no wight till he comes
     may profane the great chair, or the porridge of plums
     for the best of the cheer, and the seat by the fire,
     is the undenied right of the barefooted friar.

     long flourish the sandal, the cord, and the cope,
     the dread of the devil and trust of the pope;
     for to gather lifeâ€™s roses, unscathed by the briar,
     is granted alone to the barefooted friar.


â€œby my troth,â€ said the knight, â€œthou hast sung well and lustily, and in
high praise of thine order. and, talking of the devil, holy clerk,
are you not afraid that he may pay you a visit during some of your
uncanonical pastimes?â€

â€œi uncanonical!â€ answered the hermit; â€œi scorn the charge--i scorn it
with my heels!--i serve the duty of my chapel duly and truly--two masses

â€œâ€˜exceptis excipiendisâ€™â€ replied the hermit, â€œas our old abbot taught me
to say, when impertinent laymen should ask me if i kept every punctilio
of mine order.â€

â€œtrue, holy father,â€ said the knight; â€œbut the devil is apt to keep
an eye on such exceptions; he goes about, thou knowest, like a roaring
lion.â€

â€œlet him roar here if he dares,â€ said the friar; â€œa touch of my cord
will make him roar as loud as the tongs of st dunstan himself did. i
never feared man, and i as little fear the devil and his imps. saint
dunstan, saint dubric, saint winibald, saint winifred, saint swibert,

â€œwalked up towards the watling-street, to watch for the prior of

â€œthat is well thought on also,â€ replied the captain;--â€œand where is the

the hermit speedily unbolted his portal, and admitted locksley, with his
two companions.

â€œwhy, hermit,â€ was the yeomanâ€™s first question as soon as he beheld the
knight, â€œwhat boon companion hast thou here?â€

â€œa brother of our order,â€ replied the friar, shaking his head; â€œwe have
been at our orisons all night.â€

â€œhe is a monk of the church militant, i think,â€ answered locksley; â€œand
there be more of them abroad. i tell thee, friar, thou must lay down
the rosary and take up the quarter-staff; we shall need every one of our
merry men, whether clerk or layman.--but,â€ he added, taking him a step
aside, â€œart thou mad? to give admittance to a knight thou dost not know?
hast thou forgot our articles?â€

â€œnot know him!â€ replied the

 friar, boldly, â€œi know him as well as the
beggar knows his dish.â€

â€œand what is his name, then?â€ demanded locksley.

â€œhis name,â€ said the hermit--â€œhis name is sir anthony of
scrabelstone--as if i would drink with a man, and did not know his
name!â€

â€œthou hast been drinking more than enough, friar,â€ said the woodsman,
â€œand, i fear, prating more than enough too.â€

â€œgood yeoman,â€ said the knight, coming forward, â€œbe not wroth with my
merry host. he did but afford me the hospitality which i would have
compelled from him if he had refused it.â€

â€œthou compel!â€ said the friar; â€œwait but till have changed this grey
gown for a green cassock, and if i make not a quarter-staff ring twelve
upon thy pate, i am neither true clerk nor good woodsman.â€

while he spoke thus, he stri

appeared in a close
black buckram doublet and drawers, over which he speedily did on a
cassock of green, and hose of the same colour. â€œi pray thee truss my
points,â€ said he to wamba, â€œand thou shalt have a cup of sack for thy
labour.â€

â€œgramercy for thy sack,â€ said wamba; â€œbut thinkâ€™st thou it is lawful
for me to aid you to transmew thyself from a holy hermit into a sinful
forester?â€

â€œnever fear,â€ said the hermit; â€œi will but confess the sins of my green
cloak to my greyfriarâ€™s frock, and all shall be well again.â€

â€œamen!â€ answered the jester; â€œa broadcloth penitent should have a
sackcloth confessor, and your frock may absolve my motley doublet into
the bargain.â€

so saying, he accommodated the friar with his assistance in tying the
endless number of points, as the laces which attached the hose to the
doublet were then termed.

while they were thus employed, locksley led the knight a little apart,
and addressed him thus:--â€œdeny it not, sir knight--you

e unknown. believe, however, that my word, when
pledged, is as inviolate as if i wore golden spurs.â€

â€œi willingly believe it,â€ said the knight; â€œi have been accustomed
to study menâ€™s countenances, and i can read in thine honesty and
resolution. i will, therefore, ask thee no further questions, but aid
thee in setting at freedom these oppressed captives; which done, i trust
we shall part better acquainted, and well satisfied with each other.â€

â€œso,â€ said wamba to gurth,--for the friar being now fully equipped, the
jester, having approached to the other side of the hut, had heard the
conclusion of the conversation,--â€œso we have got a new ally?--l trust
the valour of the knight will be truer metal than the religion of the
hermit, or the honesty of the yeoman; for this locksley looks like a
born deer-stealer, and the priest like a lusty hypocrite.â€

â€œhold thy peace, wamba,â€ said gurth; â€œit may all be as thou dost guess;

religion enough to refuse the foul fiendâ€™s offer, and bid him get behind

the friar was now completely accoutred as a yeoman, with sword and
buckler, bow, and quiver, and a strong partisan over his shoulder. he
left his cell at the head of the party, and, having carefully locked the
door, deposited the key under the threshold.

â€œart thou in condition to do good service, friar,â€ said locksley, â€œor
does the brown bowl still run in thy head?â€

â€œnot more than a drought of st dunstanâ€™s fountain will allay,â€ answered
the priest; â€œsomething there is of a whizzing in my brain, and of
instability in my legs, but you shall presently see both pass away.â€

so saying, he stepped to the stone basin, in which the waters of
the fountain as they fell formed bubbles which danced in the white
moonlight, and took so long a drought as if he had meant to exhaust the
sprin

â€œwhen didst thou drink as deep a drought of water before, holy clerk of

â€œnever since my wine-butt leaked, and let out its liquor by an illegal
vent,â€ replied the friar, â€œand so left me nothing to drink but my
patronâ€™s bounty here.â€

then plunging his hands and head into the fountain, he washed from them
all marks of the midnight revel.

thus refreshed and sobered, the jolly priest twirled his heavy partisan
round his head with three fingers, as if he had been balancing a reed,
exclaiming at the same time, â€œwhere be those false ravishers, who carry
off wenches against their will? may the foul fiend fly off with me, if i

a deed for which i could exact a fearful penalty.â€

â€œi would,â€ said the black knight, â€œthere were some one among us who
could obtain admission into the castle, and discover how the case stands
with the besieged. methinks, as they require a confessor to be sent,
this holy hermit might at once exercise his pious vocation, and procure
us the information we desire.â€

â€œa plague on thee, and thy advice!â€ said the pious hermit; â€œi tell thee,
sir slothful knight, that when i doff my friarâ€™s frock, my priesthood,
my sanctity, my very latin, are put off along with it; and when in my
green jerkin, i can better kill twenty deer than confess one christian.â€

â€œi fear,â€ said the black knight, â€œi fear greatly, there is no one here
that is qualified to take upon him, for the nonce, this same character
of father confessor?â€

all looked on each other, and were silent.

sanctity, and learning which are stitched into the cowl of it, i shall
be found qualified to administer both worldly and ghostly comfort to our
worthy master cedric, and his companions in adversity.â€

assure these tyrants, that whatever violence they exercise on the
persons of their prisoners, shall be most severely repaid upon their
own.â€

â€œpax vobiscum,â€ said wamba, who was now muffled in his religious
disguise.

and so saying he imitated the solemn and stately deportment of a friar,
and departed to execute his mission.

when the jester, arrayed in the cowl and frock of the hermit, and having
his knotted cord twisted round his middle, stood before the portal of
the castle of front-de-boeuf, the warder demanded of him his name and
errand.

our own drunken confessor, a cock of thy feather hath not crowed these
twenty years.â€

â€œyet i pray thee, do mine errand to the lord of the castle,â€ answered
the pretended friar; â€œtrust me it will find good acceptance with him,
and the cock shall crow, that the whole castle shall hear him.â€

â€œgramercy,â€ said the warder; â€œbut if i come to shame for leaving my
post upon thine errand, i will try whether a friarâ€™s grey gown be proof
against a grey-goose shaft.â€

with this threat he left his turret, and carried to the hall of the
castle his unwonted intelligence, that a holy friar stood before the
gate and demanded instant admission. with no small wonder he re

â€œtell me in plain terms what numbers there are, or, priest, thy cloak

â€œto bid you prepare yourselves for death,â€ answered the jester.

they are, they dare not attempt such open and gratuitous cruelty!â€

â€œalas!â€ said the jester, â€œto restrain them by their sense of humanity,

the exchange of dress was now accomplished, when a sudden doubt struck
cedric.

â€œi know no language,â€ he said, â€œbut my own, and a few words of their
mincing norman. how shall i bear myself like a reverend brother?â€

â€œthe spell lies in two words,â€ replied wamba--â€œâ€˜pax vobiscumâ€™ will
answer all queries. if you go or come, eat or drink, bless or ban, â€˜pax
vobiscumâ€™ carries you through it all. it is as useful to a friar as a
broomstick to a witch, or a wand to a conjurer. speak it but thus, in a
deep grave tone,--â€˜pax vobiscum!â€™--it is irresistible--watch and ward,
knight and squire, foot and horse, it acts as a charm upon them all.
i think, if they bring me out to be hanged to-morrow, as is much to
be doubted they may, i will try its weight upon the finisher of the
sentence.â€

â€œfarewell, noble cedric,â€ said athelstane; â€œremember it is the true part
of a friar to accept refreshment, if you are offered any.â€

â€œfarewell, uncle,â€ added wamba; â€œand remember â€˜pax vobiscumâ€™.â€

thus exhorted, cedric sallied forth upon his expedition; and it was not
long ere he had occasion to try the force of that spell which his jester
had recommended as omnipotent. in a low-arched and dusky passage, by
which he endeavoured to work his way to the hall of the castle, he was
interrupted by a female form.

compelled himself to make obeisance to the haughty baron, who returned
his courtesy with a slight inclination of the head.

â€œthy penitents, father, have made a long shrift--it is the better for
them, since it is the last they shall ever make. hast thou prepared them
for death?â€

â€œi found them,â€ said cedric, in such french as he could command,
â€œexpecting the worst, from the moment they knew into whose power they
had fallen.â€

â€œhow now, sir friar,â€ replied front-de-boeuf, â€œthy speech, methinks,
smacks of a saxon tongue?â€

â€œi was bred in the convent of st withold of burton,â€ answered cedric.

â€œay?â€ said the baron; â€œit had been better for thee to have been a

â€œspeak your commands,â€ said cedric, with suppressed emotion.

â€œfollow me through this passage, then, that i may dismiss thee by the
postern.â€

and as he strode on his way before the supposed friar, front-de-boeuf
thus schooled him in the part which he desired he should act.

â€œthou seest, sir friar, yon herd of saxon swine, who have dared to

before it for twenty-four hours. meantime bear thou this scroll--but

the hands of the cruel front-de-boeuf.

â€œthe royal blood of alfred is endangered,â€ said cedric.

â€œthe honour of a noble lady is in peril,â€ said the black knight.

â€œand, by the saint christopher at my baldric,â€ said the good yeoman,
â€œwere there no other cause than the safety of that poor faithful knave,
wamba, i would jeopard a joint ere a hair of his head were hurt.â€

â€œand so would i,â€ said the friar; â€œwhat, sirs! i trust well that a

master of his craft, and can give as much relish and flavour to a cup of
wine as ever a flitch of bacon can--i say, brethren, such a fool shall

and, snatching it up, he again assailed the loosened pinnacle, which was
of weight enough, if thrown down, not only to have destroyed the remnant
of the drawbridge, which sheltered the two foremost assailants, but also
to have sunk the rude float of planks over which they had crossed. all
saw the danger, and the boldest, even the stout friar himself, avoided
setting foot on the raft. thrice did locksley bend his shaft against de
bracy, and thrice did his arrow bound back from the knightâ€™s armour of
proof.

during this combat and the brief conversation which ensued, cedric, at
the head of a body of men, among whom the friar was conspicuous, had
pushed across the bridge as soon as they saw the postern open, and drove
back the dispirited and despairing followers of de bracy, of whom some
asked quarter, some offered vain resistance, and the greater part fled
towards the court-yard. de bracy himself arose from the ground, and cast
a sorrowful glance after his conqueror. â€œhe trusts me not!â€ he repeated;
â€œbut have i deserved his trust?â€ he then lifted his sword from the
floor, took off his helmet in token of sub

one of turf erected under the twisted branches of the huge
oak, and the silvan followers were gathered around him. he assigned to
the black knight a seat at his right hand, and to cedric a place upon
his left.

â€œpardon my freedom, noble sirs,â€ he said, â€œbut in these glades i am
monarch--they are my kingdom; and these my wild subjects would reck but
little of my power, were i, within my own dominions, to yield place to

the numbers who hastened to execute this duty, considering that an
interesting division of spoil was about to take place, showed how much
the troop had at heart the safety of their spiritual father.

â€œmeanwhile, let us proceed,â€ said locksley; â€œfor when this bold deed

a prisoner at no great distance, and i would fain have the friar to help
me to deal with him in due sort--i greatly misdoubt the safety of the

â€œwe can bear witness,â€ said gilbert; â€œfor when we had cleared away the

found the runlet of sack half empty, the jew half dead, and the friar
more than half--exhausted, as he calls it.â€

â€œye be knaves! ye lie!â€ retorted the offended friar; â€œit was you and
your gormandizing companions that drank up the sack, and called it your

â€œthou liest, jew, and thou knowest thou dost.â€ said the friar; â€œi will
remind thee of but one word of our conference--thou didst promise to
give all thy substance to our holy order.â€

â€œso help me the promise, fair sirs,â€ said isaac, even more alarmed than
before, â€œas no such sounds ever crossed my lips! alas! i am an aged

accordingly, he raised his halberd, and

â€œnay, be not wroth with me,â€ said the knight; â€œthou knowest i am thy
sworn friend and comrade.â€

â€œi know no such thing,â€ answered the friar; â€œand defy thee for a
meddling coxcomb!â€

â€œnay, but,â€ said the knight, who seemed to take a pleasure in provoking
his quondam host, â€œhast thou forgotten how, that for my sake (for i say
nothing of the temptation of the flagon and the pasty) thou didst break
thy vow of fast and vigil?â€

â€œtruly, friend,â€ said the friar, clenching his huge fist, â€œi will bestow

â€œno brawling,â€ said the knight, â€œit is but a friendly interchange of

â€œthou hast the advantage with that iron pot on thy head,â€ said the
churchman; â€œbut have at thee--down thou goest, an thou wert goliath of

the friar bared his brawny arm up to the elbow, and putting his full
strength to the blow, gave the knight a buffet that might have felled an

so spoke the burly priest, assuming, on his part, high defiance. but
who may resist his fate? the buffet of the knight was given with such
strength and good-will, that the friar rolled head over heels upon
the plain, to the great amazement of all the spectators. but he arose
neither angry nor crestfallen.

men, who, taking on them the sacred character without due cause, profane
the holy rites, and endanger the souls of those who take counsel at
their hands; â€˜lapides pro pane condonantes iisâ€™, giving them stones
instead of bread as the vulgate hath it.â€

â€œnay,â€ said the friar, â€œan my brain-pan could have been broken by latin,

misproud priests as thou art of their jewels and their gimcracks, is a
lawful spoiling of the egyptians.â€

â€œthou beâ€™st a hedge-priest,â€ [46] said the prior, in great wrath,

made thy peace perfect with god, provoke the friar no further.--hermit,
let the reverend father depart in peace, as a ransomed man.â€

the yeomen separated the incensed priests, who continued to raise their
voices, vituperating each other in bad latin, which the prior delivered
the more fluently, and the hermit with the greater vehemence. the prior
at length recollected himself sufficiently to be aware that he was
compromising his dignity, by squabbling with such a hedge-priest as the

so the prior of saint botolphâ€™s hobbled back again into the refectory,
to preside over the stockfish and ale, which was just serving out for
the friarsâ€™ breakfast. busy and important, he sat him down at the table,
and many a dark word he threw out, of benefits to be expected to the
convent, and high deeds of service done by himself, which, at another
season, would have attracted observation. but as the stockfish was
highly salted, and the ale reasonably powerful, the jaws of the brethren
were too anxiously employed to admit of their making much use of their
ears; nor do we read of any of the fraternity, who was tempted to

â€œwhy,â€ said wamba, â€œan your valour be so dull, you will please to learn

the knight.

approached with great caution.

â€œmy knightly word i pledge; only come on with thy foolish self.â€

â€œnay, then, valour and folly are once more boon companions,â€ said the
jester, coming up frankly to the knightâ€™s side; â€œbut, in truth, i love
not such buffets as that you bestowed on the burly friar, when his
holiness rolled on the green like a king of the nine-pins. and now that
folly wears the horn, let valour rouse himself, and shake his mane;

the ground; yet the situation of the knight of the fetterlock continued
very precarious, as he was pressed close by several men completely
armed, and began to be fatigued by the violent exertions necessary
to defend himself on so many points at nearly the same moment, when
a grey-goose shaft suddenly stretched on the earth one of the most
formidable of his assailants, and a band of yeomen broke forth from the
glade, headed by locksley and the jovial friar, who, taking ready and
effectual part in the fray, soon disposed of the ruffians, all of whom
lay on the spot dead or mortally wounded. the black knight thanked his
deliverers with a dignity they had not observed in his former bearing,
which hitherto had seemed rather that of a blunt bold soldier, than of a
person of exalted rank.

richard looked around, and beheld the jovial friar on his knees, telling
his rosary, while his quarter-staff, which had not been idle during the
skirmish, lay on the grass beside him. his countenance was gathered so
as he thought might best express the most profound contrition, his
eyes being turned up, and the corners of his mouth drawn down, as wamba
expressed it, like the tassels at the mouth of a purse. yet this demure
affectation of extreme penitence was whimsically belied by a ludicrous
meaning which lurked in his huge features, and seeme

secrets that pass over the flagon.â€

â€œnay, most gracious sovereign,â€ answered the hermit, (well known to the
curious in penny-histories of robin hood, by the name of friar
tuck,) â€œit is not the crosier i fear, but the sceptre.--alas! that my
sacrilegious fist should ever have been applied to the ear of the lordâ€™s
anointed!â€

â€œha! ha!â€ said richard, â€œsits the wind there?--in truth i had forgotten
the buffet, though mine ear sung after it for a whole day. but if the
cuff was fairly given, i will be judged by the good men around, if it
was not as well repaid--or, if thou thinkest i still owe thee aught, and
will stand forth for another counterbuff--â€

little reason to complain of an empty exchequer.â€

blow!---â€

so many cuffs from paynims and misbelievers, i were void of reason to
quarrel with the buffet of a clerk so holy as he of copmanhurst. yet,

with the wild spirit of chivalry which so often impelled his master
upon dangers which he might easily have avoided, or rather, which it
was unpardonable in him to have sought out. the young knight sighed,
therefore, and held his peace; while richard, rejoiced at having

scathlock obeyed his captain, and in less than five minutes the
revellers were startled by the sound of his horn.

himself to sword and target. all the others stood to their weapons.

of coningsburgh, as right was; and thither had i gone, but for mabel
parkins, who--â€

â€œay, dead was athelstane,â€ said the old man, shaking his head, â€œand the
more pity it was, for the old saxon blood--â€

â€œbut, your story, my masters--your story,â€ said the minstrel, somewhat
impatiently.

â€œay, ay--construe us the story,â€ said a burly friar, who stood beside
them, leaning on a pole that exhibited an appearance between a pilgrimâ€™s
staff and a quarter-staff, and probably acted as either when occasion
served,--â€œyour story,â€ said the stalwart churchman; â€œburn not daylight
about it--we have short time to spare.â€

â€œan please your reverence,â€ said dennet, â€œa drunken priest came to visit
the sacristan at saint edmundâ€™s---â€

â€œit does not please my reverence,â€ answered the churchman, â€œthat there
should be such an a

â€œthat last part of thy speech, dennet,â€ said the minstrel, â€œhas saved
thee a rib or twain.â€

â€œtush, man, i fear him not,â€ said dennet; â€œi am somewhat old and stiff,
but when i fought for the bell and ram at doncaster--â€

â€œbut the story--the story, my friend,â€ again said the minstrel.

â€œwhy, the tale is but this--athelstane of coningsburgh was buried at
saint edmundâ€™s.â€

â€œthatâ€™s a lie, and a loud one,â€ said the friar, â€œfor i saw him borne to
his own castle of coningsburgh.â€

â€œnay, then, eâ€™en tell the story yourself, my masters,â€ said dennet,
turning sulky at these repeated contradictions; and it was with some
difficulty that the boor could be prevailed on, by the request of
his comrade and the minstrel, to renew his tale.--â€œthese two â€˜soberâ€™
friars,â€ said he at length, â€œsince this reverend man will needs have
them such, had continued drinking good ale, and wine, and what not,

t part for a summerâ€™s day, when they were aroused by a
deep groan, and a clanking of chains, and the figure of the deceased
athelstane entered the apartment, saying, â€˜ye evil shep-herds!--â€™â€

â€œit is false,â€ said the friar, hastily, â€œhe never spoke a word.â€

â€œso ho! friar tuck,â€ said the minstrel, drawing him apart from the
rustics; â€œwe have started a new hare, i find.â€

â€œi tell thee, allan-a-dale,â€ said the hermit, â€œi saw athelstane of
coningsburgh as much as bodily eyes ever saw a living man. he had his
shroud on, and all about him smelt of the sepulchre--a butt of sack will
not wash it out of my memory.â€

â€œpshaw!â€ answered the minstrel; â€œthou dost but jest with me!â€

â€œnever believe me,â€ said the friar, â€œan i fetched not a knock at

through his body as it might through a pillar of smoke!â€

â€œby saint hubert,â€ said the minstrel, â€œbut it is a wondrous tale, and
fit to be put in metre to the ancient tune, â€˜sorrow came to the old
friar.â€™â€

â€œlaugh, if ye list,â€ said friar tuck; â€œbut an ye catch me singing
on such a theme, may the next ghost or devil carry me off with him
headlong! no, no--i instantly formed the purpose of assisting at some
good work, such as the burning of a witch, a judicial combat, or the
like matter of godly service, and therefore am i here.â€

as they thus conversed, the heavy bell of the church of saint michael of
templestowe, a venerable building, situated in a hamlet at some distance
from the preceptory, broke short their argument. one

â€œfalse villain! what meanest thou by thy hand on my rein?â€ said sir
brian, angrily. and shaking off his companionâ€™s grasp, he rode back to
the upper end of the lists.

â€œthere is yet spirit in him,â€ said malvoisin apart to mont-fitchet,
â€œwere it well directed--but, like the greek fire, it burns whatever
approaches it.â€

the judges had now been two hours in the lists, awaiting in vain the
appearance of a champion.

â€œand reason good,â€ said friar tuck, â€œseeing she is a jewess--and yet,
by mine order, it is hard that so young and beautiful a creature should
perish without one blow being struck in her behalf! were she ten times
a witch, provided she were but the least bit of a christian, my
quarter-staff should ring noon on the steel cap of yonder fierce
templar, ere he carried the matter off thus.â€

it was, however, the general belief that no one could or would appear
for a jewess, accused of sorcery; and the knights, instigated by

and who perform mass before them. unquestionably, such reverend persons,
in such a society, must accommodate their manners and their morals to
the community in which they live; and if they can occasionally obtain
a degree of reverence for their supposed spiritual gifts, are, on most
occasions, loaded with unmerciful ridicule, as possessing a character
inconsistent with all around them.

hence the fighting parson in the old play of sir john oldcastle, and the
famous friar of robin hoodâ€™s band. nor were such characters ideal. there
exists a monition of the bishop of durham against irregular churchmen
of this class, who associated themselves with border robbers, and
desecrated the holiest offices of the priestly function, by celebrating
them for the benefit of thieves, robbers, and murderers, amongst ruins
and in caverns of the earth, without regard to canonical form, and with
torn and dirty attire, and maimed rites, altogether improper for the
occasion.

merit this disgraceful epithet. even william the conqueror, hated as he
was by them, continued to draw a considerable army of anglo-saxons to
his standard, by threatening to stigmatize those who staid at home, as

influence on the danes. l. t.]
