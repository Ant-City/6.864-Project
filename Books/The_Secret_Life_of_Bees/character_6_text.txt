that  it  seemed  like  june  might  not  want  me  here 
because  of  my  skin  color.  i  hadn't  known  this  was  
possible—to reject people for  being white. a hot wave 
passed  through  my  body.  "righteous  indignation"  is 
what  brother  gerald  called  it.  jesus  had  righteous 
indignation  when  he  turned  over  the  tables  in  the

temple  and  drove  out  the  thieving  moneychangers.  i 
wanted to march up there, flip a couple of tables over, 
and say, excuse me, june boatwright, but you don't even 
know met. 

"let's see if we can help her," august said as june 

disappeared from my line of sight. "we owe her that." 

"i  don't  see  that  we  owe  her  anything,"  june 
said.  a  door slammed.  august  flipped off  the light and 
let out a sigh that floated into the darkness. 

i  walked  back  toward  the  honey  house,  feeling 
ashamed  that  august  had  seen  through  my  hoax  but 
relieved,  too,  that  she  wasn't  planning  on  calling  the 
police or sendin

  the spray  on  me.  some  of  the water rushed  up 
my nose and burned. i yanked at the sprinkler, and each 
of us held on to one side of it while it blasted away at 
our  stomachs  and  chins.  we  went  to  our  knees, 
wrestling for it, the geyser weaving between us, her eyes

staring at me, close and bright with beads of water on 
her eyelashes. 

i  heard  may  start  to  hum  "oh!  susanna."  i 
laughed to let her know it was all right, but i wouldn't let 
go. i would not let june boatwright win. 

rosaleen said, "they say if you aim the hose on 
two locked dogs, they'll turn loose, but i guess that ain't 
always so." 

august  laughed,  and  i  saw  the  softening  come 
around june's eyes, how she was trying not to laugh, but 
it  was  like  the  dutch  boy  pulling  his  finger  out  of  the  
dike—the minute she softened her eyes, the whole thing 
collapsed.  i  could  almost  see  her  smack  her  forehead, 
thinking,  i  am  wrestling  with  a  fourteen-year-old  girl 
over

june said, "lord, i feel woozy, 
like  somebody  has  pulled  the  plugs  in  my  feet  and 
drained me out." 

rosaleen, may, and august  had returned  to the 
business of being water nymphs. i looked back down at 
the ground where our bodies had lain side by side, the

wet  grasses  pressed  down,  perfect  depressions  in  the 
earth.  i stepped  over  them with  the  utmost  care,  and, 
seeing how careful i was, june stepped over them, too, 
and then, to my shock, she hugged me. june boatwright 
hugged  me  while  our  clothes  made  sweet,  squishy 
sounds up and down our bodies.

if  the  heat  goes  over  104  degrees  in  south 
carolina, you have to go to bed. it is practically the law. 
some  people  might  see  it  as  shiftless  behavior,  but 
really,  when  we're  lying  down  from  the  heat,  we're 
giving our minds time to browse around for new ideas, 
wondering at  the true  aim of  life,  and generally letting 
things  pop  into  our  heads  that  need  to
