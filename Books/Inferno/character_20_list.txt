Fra Alberigo and Branca d'Oria - 
Sinners condemned to the Third Ring of the Ninth
Circle of Hell. Fra Alberigo and Branca d'Oria are unlike the other
sinners Dante encounters: their crimes were deemed to be so great that
devils snatched their souls from their living bodies; thus, their
souls reside in Hell while their bodies live on, now guided and
possessed by demons.
