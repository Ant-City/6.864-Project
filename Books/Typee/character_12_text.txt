 of the happar mountain, where a path
was seen winding out of sight through a gorge.

no sign of a boat, however, was beheld, nothing but a tumultuous crowd
of men and women, and some one in their midst, earnestly talking to
them. as my comrade advanced, this person came forward and proved to
be no stranger. he was an old grizzled sailor, whom toby and myself had
frequently seen in nukuheva, where he lived an easy devil-may-care life
in the household of mowanna the king, going by the name of ‘jimmy’.
in fact he was the royal favourite, and had a good deal to say in his
master’s councils. he wore a manilla hat and a sort of tappa morning
gown, sufficiently loose and negligent to show the verse of a song
tattooed upon his chest, and a variety of spirited cuts by native
artists in other parts of his body. he sported a fishing rod in his
hand, and carried a sooty old pipe slung about his neck.

this old rover having retired from active life, had resided in nukuheva
some time--could speak

cerer, who lived away
off in a den among the mountains, where he hid from the world a
great pair of horns that grew out of his temples. notwithstanding his
reputation for piety, this horrid old fellow was the terror of all the
island round, being reported to come out from his retreat, and go a
man-hunting every dark night. some anonymous paul pry, too, coming down
the mountain, once got a peep at his den, and found it full of bones. in
short, he was a most unheard-of monster.

the other prodigy jimmy told us about was the younger son of a chief,
who, although but just turned of ten, had entered upon holy orders,
because his superstitious countrymen thought him especially intended
for the priesthood from the fact of his having a comb on his head like
a rooster. but this was not all; for still more wonderful to relate, the
boy prided himself upon his strange crest, being actually endowed with a
cock’s voice, and frequently crowing over his peculiarity.

but to return to toby. the moment he

saw the old rover on the beach, he
ran up to him, the natives following after, and forming a circle round
them.

after welcoming him to the shore, jimmy went on to tell him how that he
knew all about our having run away from the ship, and being among the
typees. indeed, he had been urged by mowanna to come over to the valley,
and after visiting his friends there, to bring us back with him, his
royal master being exceedingly anxious to share with him the reward
which had been held out for our capture. he, however, assured toby that
he had indignantly spurned the offer.

all this astonished my comrade not a little, as neither of us had
entertaine

d the least idea that any white man ever visited the typees
sociably. but jimmy told him that such was the case nevertheless,
although he seldom came into the bay, and scarcely ever went back
from the beach. one of the priests of the valley, in some way or other
connected with an old tattooed divine in nukuheva, was a friend of his,
and through him he was ‘taboo’.

he said, moreover, that he was sometimes employed to come round to the
bay, and engage fruit for ships lying in nukuheva. in fact, he was now
on that very errand, according to his own account, having just co

across the mountains by the way of happar. by noon of the next day the
fruit would be heaped up in stacks on the beach, in readiness for the
boats which he then intended to bring into the bay.

jimmy now asked toby whether he wished to leave the island--if he did,
there was a ship in want of men lying in the other harbour, and he would
be glad to take him over, and see him on board that very day.

‘no,’ said toby, ‘i cannot leave the island unless my comrade goes with
me. i left him up the valley because they would not let him come down.
let us go now and fetch him.’

‘but how is he to cross the mountain with us,’ replied jimmy, ‘even if
we get him down to the beach? better le

never do,’ said toby, ‘but come along with me now, and let
us get him down here at any rate,’ and yielding to the impulse of the
moment, he started to hurry back into the valley. but hardly was his
back turned, when a dozen hands were laid on him, and he learned that he
could not go a step further.

it was in vain that he fought with them; they would not hear of his
stirring from the beach. cut to the heart at this unexpected repulse,
toby now conjured the sailor to go after me alone. but jimmy replied,
that in the mood the typees then were they would not permit him so to
do, though at the same time he was not afraid of their offering him any
harm.

little did toby then think, as he afterwards had good reason to suspect,
that this very jimmy was a heartless villain, who, by his arts, had just
incited the natives to restrain him as he was in the act of going after
me. well must the old sailor have known, too, that the natives would
never consent to our leaving together, and he therefor

e wanted to get
toby off alone, for a purpose which he afterwards made plain. of all
this, however, my comrade now knew nothing.

he was still struggling with the islanders when jimmy again came up to
him, and warned him against irritating them, saying that he was only
making matters worse for both of us, and if they became enraged, there
was no telling what might happen. at last he made toby sit down on a
broken canoe by a pile of stones, upon which was a ruinous little shrine
supported by four upright poles, and in front partly screened by a net.
the fishing parties met there, when they came in from the sea, for their
offerings were laid before an image, upon a smooth blac

k stone within.
this spot jimmy said was strictly ‘taboo’, and no one would molest or
come near him while he stayed by its shadow. the old sailor then went
off, and began speaking very earnestly to mow-mow and some other chiefs,
while all the rest formed a circle round the taboo place, looking
intently at toby, and talking to each other without ceasing.

now, notwithstanding what jimmy had just told him, there presently came
up to my comrade an old woman, who seated herself beside him on the
canoe.

‘typee motarkee?’ said she. ‘motarkee nuee,’ said toby.

she then asked him whether he was going to nukuheva; he nodded yes; and
with a plaintive wail and her eyes filling with tears she rose and left
him.

this old woman, the sailor afterwards said, was the wife of an aged king
of a small island valley, communicating by a deep pass with the country
of the typees. the inma

tes of the two valleys were related to each other
by blood, and were known by the same name. the old woman had gone down
into the typee valley the day before, and was now with three chiefs, her
sons, on a visit to her kinsmen.

as the old king’s wife left him, jimmy again came up to toby, and told
him that he had just talked the whole matter over with the natives, and
there was only one course for him to follow. they would not allow him to
go back into the valley, and harm would certainly come to both him and
me, if he remained much longer on the beach. ‘so,’ said he, ‘you and i
had better go to nukuheva now overland, and tomorrow i will bring tommo,
as they call him, by water; they have promised to carry him down to the
sea for me early in the morni

’ said toby. but the sailor had many
reasons, all of which were so mixed up with the mysterious customs
of the islanders, that he was none the wiser. indeed, their conduct,
especially in preventing him from returning into the valley, was
absolutely unaccountable to him; and added to everything else, was the
bitter reflection, that the old sailor, after all, might possibly be
deceiving him. and then again he had to think of me, left alone with the
natives, and by no means well. if he went with jimmy, he might at least
hope to procure some relief for me. but might not the savages who had
acted so strangely, hurry me off somewhere before his return? then, even
if he remained, perhaps they would not let him go back into the valley
where i was.

thus perplexed was my poor comrade; he knew not what to do, and his
courageous spirit was of no use to him now. there he was, all by
himself, seated upon the broken canoe--the natives grouped around him at
a distance, and eyeing him more and more fixed

ly. ‘it is getting late:
said jimmy, who was standing behind the rest. ‘nukuheva is far off, and
i cannot cross the happar country by night. you see how it is;--if you
come along with me, all will be well; if you do not, depend upon it,
neither of you will ever escape.’

‘there is no help for it,’ said toby, at last, with a heavy heart, ‘i
will have to trust you,’ and he came out from the shadow of the little
shrine, and cast a long look up the valley.

‘now keep close to my side,’ said the sailor, ‘and let us b

quickly.’ tinor and fayaway here appeared; the kindhearted old woman
embracing toby’s knees, and giving way to a flood of tears; while
fayaway, hardly less moved, spoke some few words of english she had
learned, and held up three fingers before him--in so many days he would
return.

at last jimmy pulled toby out of the crowd, and after calling to a
young typee who was standing by with a young pig in his arms, all three
started for the mountains.

‘i have told them that you are coming back again,’ said the old fellow,
laughing, as they began the ascent, ‘but they’ll have to wait a long
time.’ toby turned, and saw the natives all in motion--the girls waving
their tappas in adieu, and the men their spears. as the last figure
entered the grove with one arm raised, and the three fi

heart smote him.

as the natives had at last consented to his going, it might have been,
that some of them, at least, really counted upon his speedy return;
probably supposing, as indeed he had told them when they were coming
down the valley, that his only object in leaving them was to procure the
medicines i needed. this, jimmy also must have told them. and as they
had done before, when my comrade, to oblige me, started on his perilous
journey to nukuheva, they looked upon me, in his absence, as one of two
inseparable friends who was a sure guaranty for the other’s return.
this is only my own supposition, however, for as to all their strange
conduct, it is still a mystery.

‘you see what sort of a taboo man i am,’ said the sailor, after for some
time silently following the path which led up the mountain. ‘mow-

nd tomorrow
with tommo. cheer up, then, and rely upon me, you will see him in the
morning.’

the ascent of the mountain was not very difficult, owing to its being
near to the sea, where the island ridges are comparatively low; the
path, too, was a fine one, so that in a short time all three were
standing on the summit with the two valleys at their feet. the white
cascade marking the green head of the typee valley first caught toby’s
eye; marheyo’s house could easily be traced by them.

as jimmy led the way along the ridge, toby observed that the valley of
the happars did not extend near so far inland as that of the typees.
this accounted for our mistake in entering the latter valley as we had.

a path leading down from the mountain was soon seen, and, following it,
the party were in a short time fairly in the happar valley.

‘now,’ said jimmy, as they hurried on, ‘we taboo men have wives in all
the bays, and i am going to show you the two i have here.’

so, when they came to t

he house where he said they lived,--which was
close by the base of the mountain in a shady nook among the groves--he
went in, and was quite furious at finding it empty--the ladies, had gone
out. however, they soon made their appearance, and to tell the truth,
welcomed jimmy quite cordially, as well as toby, about whom they were
very inquisitive. nevertheless, as the report of their arrival spread,
and the happars began to assemble, it became evident that the appearance
of a white stranger among them was not by any means deemed so wonderful
an event as in the neighbouring valley.

the old sailor now bade his wives prepare something to eat, as he must
be in nukuheva before dark. a meal of fish, bread-fruit, and bananas,
was accordingly served up, the party regaling

themselves on the mats, in
the midst of a numerous company.

the happars put many questions to jimmy about toby; and toby himself
looked sharply at them, anxious to recognize the fellow who gave him the
wound from which he was still suffering. but this fiery gentleman, so
handy with his spear, had the delicacy, it seemed, to keep out of view.
certainly the sight of him would not have been any added inducement to
making a stay in the valley,--some of the afternoon loungers in happar
having politely urged toby to spend a few days with them,--there was a
feast coming on. he, however, declined.

a

ll this while the young typee stuck to jimmy like his shadow, and
though as lively a dog as any of his tribe, he was now as meek as
a lamb, never opening his mouth except to eat. although some of the
happars looked queerly at him, others were more civil, and seemed
desirous of taking him abroad and showing him the valley. but the typee
was not to be cajoled in that way. how many yards he would have to
remove from jimmy before the taboo would be powerless, it would be hard
to tell, but probably he himself knew to a fraction.

on the promise of a red cotton handkerchief, and something else which he
kept secret, this poor fellow had undertaken a rather ticklish journey,
though, as far as toby could ascertain, it was something that had never
happened before.

the island-punch--arva--was brought in at the conclusion of the repast,
and passed round in a shallow calabash.

now my comrade, while seated in the happar 
 
 ___________________________
 
house, began to feel more
troubled than ever at leaving me; indeed, so sad did he feel that he
talked about going back to the valley, and wanted jimmy to escort him
as far as the mountains. but the sailor would not listen to him, and, by
way of diverting his thoughts, pressed him to drink of the arva. knowing
its narcotic nature, he refused; but jimmy said he would have something
mixed with it, which would convert it into an innocent beverage that
would inspirit them for the rest of their journey. so at last he was
induced to drink of it, and its effects were just as the sailor had
predicted; his spirits rose at once, and all his gloomy thoughts left
him.

the old rover now began to reveal his true character, though he was
hardly suspected at the time. ‘if i get you off to a ship,’ said he,
‘you will surely give a poor fellow something

 and watched them as they
ascended the mountain, one group of bandit-looking fellows, shaking
their spears and casting threatening glances at the poor typee, whose
heart as well as heels seemed much the lighter when he came to look down
upon them.

on gaining the heights once more, their way led for a time along several
ridges covered with enormous ferns. at last they entered upon a wooded
tract, and here they overtook a party of nukuheva natives, well armed,
and carrying bundles of long poles. jimmy seemed to know them all very
well, and stopped for a while, and had a talk about the ‘wee-wees’, as
the people of nukuheva call the monsieurs.

the party with the poles were king mowanna’s men, and by his orders they
had been gathering them in the ravines for his allies the french.

leaving these fellows to trudge on with their loads, toby and his
companions now pushed forward again, as the sun was already low in the
west. they came upon the valleys of nukuheva on one side of the bay,
whe

re the highlands slope off into the sea. the men-of-war were still
lying in the harbour, and as toby looked down upon them, the strange
events which had happened so recently, seemed all a dream.

they soon descended towards the beach, and found themselves in jimmy’s
house before it was well dark. here he received another welcome from
his nukuheva wives, and after some refreshments in the shape of cocoanut
milk and poee-poee, they entered a canoe (the typee of course going
along) and paddled off to a whaleship which was anchored near the shore.
this was the vessel in want of men. our own had sailed some time before.
the captain professed great pleasure at seeing toby, but thought from
his exhausted appearance that he must be unfit for duty. however, he

 
 ___________________________
 
agreed to ship him, as well as his comrade, as soon as he should arrive.
toby begged hard for an armed boat, in which to go round to typee and
rescue me, notwithstanding the promises of jimmy. but this the captain
would not hear of, and told him to have patience, for the sailor would
be faithful to his word. when, too, he demanded the five silver dollars
for jimmy, the captain was unwilling to give them. but toby insisted
upon it, as he now began to think that jimmy might be a mere mercenary,
who would be sure to prove faithless if not well paid. accordingly he
not only gave him the money, but took care to assure him, over and over
again, that as soon as he brought me aboard he would receive a still
larger sum.

before sun-rise the next day, jimmy and the typee started in two of the
ship’s boats, which were manned by tabooed natives. toby, of course, was
all eagerness to go along, but the sailor told him that if he did, it
would spoil all; so, hard as it

 was, he was obliged to remain.

towards evening he was on the watch, and descried the boats turning the
headland and entering the bay. he strained his eyes, and thought he saw
me; but i was not there. descending from the mast almost distracted, he
grappled jimmy as he struck the deck, shouting in a voice that startled
him, ‘where is tommo?’ the old fellow faltered, but soon recovering,
did all he could to soothe him, assuring him that it had proved to be
impossible to get me down to the shore that morning; assigning many
plausible reasons, and adding that early on the morrow he was going to
visit the bay again in a french boat, when, if he did not find me on the
beach--as this time he certainly expected to--he would march right back
into the valley

, and carry me away at all hazards. he, however, again
refused to allow toby to accompany him. now, situated as toby was, his
sole dependence for the present was upon this jimmy, and therefore he
was fain to comfort himself as well as he could with what the old sailor
told him. the next morning, however, he had the satisfaction of seeing
the french boat start with jimmy in it. tonight, then, i will see him,
thought toby; but many a long day passed before he ever saw tommo again.
hardly was the boat out of sight, when the captain came forward and
ordered the anchor weighed; he was going to sea.

vain were all toby’s ravings--they were disregarded; and when he came to
himself, the sails were set, and the ship fast leaving the land.

... ‘oh!’ said he to me at our meeting, ‘what sleepless nights were
mine. often i started from my hammock, dreaming you wer
