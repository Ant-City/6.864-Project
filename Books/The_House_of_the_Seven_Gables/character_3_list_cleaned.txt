[CHARACTER] - 
                	a
young lodger in hepzibah's home, [CHARACTER] earns his living by making
an early kind of photograph known as a daguerreotype. [CHARACTER]'s
politics are very liberal and revolutionary, but he is kind despite
the strange and lawless company he keeps. no one knows that [CHARACTER]
is actually a descendant of the first matthew maule. this link has
given him hypnotic powers, but does not prevent him from falling
in love with phoebe pyncheon.
