archidamus.
if you shall chance, camillo, to visit bohemia, on the
like occasion whereon my services are now on foot, you shall see,
as i have said, great difference betwixt our bohemia and your
sicilia.

camillo.
i think this coming summer the king of sicilia means to
pay bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.

hearts fresh: they that went on crutches ere he was born desire
yet their life to see him a man.

would they else be content to die?

camillo.
yes, if there were no other excuse why they should desire to
live.

if the king had no son, they would desire to live on crutches
till he had one.

nine changes of the watery star hath been
the shepherd's note since we have left our throne
without a burden: time as long again
would be fill'd up, my brother, with our thanks;
and yet we should, for perpetuity,
go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,
yet standing in rich place, i multiply
with one we-thank-you many thousands more
that go before it.

polixenes.
                            sir, that's to-morrow.
i am question'd by my fears, of what may chance
or breed upon our absence; that may blow
no sneaping winds at home, to make us say,
'this is put forth too truly.' besides, i have stay'd
to tire your royalty.

leontes.
                      we are tougher, brother,
than you can put us to't.

polixenes.
                          no longer stay.

polixenes.

leontes.
we'll part the time between 's then: and in that
i'll no gainsaying.

polixenes.
                    press me not, beseech you, so,
there is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,
so soon as yours, could win me: so it should now,
were there necessity in your request, although
'twere needful i denied it. my affairs
do even drag me homeward: which to hinder,

leontes.

hermione.
i had thought, sir, to have held my peace until
you had drawn oaths from him not to stay. you, sir,
charge him too coldly. tell him you are sure
all in bohemia's well: this satisfaction
the by-gone day proclaimed: say this to him,
he's beat from his best ward.

but let him swear so, and he shall not stay,
we'll thwack him hence with distaffs.--

in those unfledg'd days was my wife a girl;

of this make no conclusion, lest you say
your queen and i are devils: yet, go on;
the offences we have made you do we'll answer;
if you first sinn'd with us, and that with us
you did continue fault, and that you slipp'd not

leontes.

hermione.
he'll stay, my lord.

leontes.
               at my request he would not.
hermione, my dearest, thou never spok'st
to better purpose.

hermione.

with spur we heat an acre. but to the goal:--
my last good deed was to entreat his stay;
what was my first? it has an elder sister,
or i mistake you: o, would her name were grace!
but once before i spoke to the purpose--when?
nay, let me have't; i long.

leontes.
                            why, that was when
three crabb√®d months had sour'd themselves to death,
ere i could make thee open thy white hand
and clap thyself my love; then didst thou utter
'i am yours for ever.'

hermione.
                       it is grace indeed.
why, lo you now, i have spoke to the purpose twice;
the one for ever earn'd a royal husband;
th' other for some while a friend.

from heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,
and well become the agent:'t may, i grant:
but to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,
as now they are; and making practis'd smiles
as in a looking-glass; and then to sigh, as 'twere

leontes.

how sometimes nature will betray its folly,
its tenderness, and make itself a pastime
to harder bosoms! looking on the lines
of my boy's face, methoughts i did recoil
twenty-three years; and saw myself unbreech'd,
in my green velvet coat; my dagger muzzled,
lest it should bite its master, and so prove,
as ornaments oft do, too dangerous.
how like, methought, i then was to this kernel,

he makes a july's day short as december;

that he did stay?

camillo.
                  at the good queen's entreaty.

at the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent;
but so it is, it is not. was this taken
by any understanding pate but thine?

more than the common blocks:--not noted, is't,

leontes.

with all the nearest things to my heart, as well

hast cleans'd my bosom; i from thee departed

deceiv'd in thy integrity, deceiv'd

 ___________________________
 
ilful-negligent,
it was my folly; if industriously
i play'd the fool, it was my negligence,
not weighing well the end; if ever fearful
to do a thing, where i the issue doubted,
whereof the execution did cry out
against the non-performance, 'twas a fear
which oft affects the wisest: these, my lord,
are such allow'd infirmities that honesty
is never free of. but, beseech your grace,
be plainer with me; let me know my trespass
by its own visage: if i then deny it,
'tis none of mine.

leontes.
                   have not you seen, camillo,--
but that's past doubt: you have, or your eye-glass
is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--
for, to a vision so apparent, rumour
cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation
resides not in that man that does not think it,--
my wife is slippery? if thou wilt confess,--
or else be impudently negative,
to have nor eyes nor ears nor thought,--then say
my wife's a hobby-horse; deserves a name
as rank as any flax-wench that puts to

leontes.
                     is whispering nothing?
is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?
kissing with inside lip? stopping the career
of laughter with a sigh?--a note infallible
of breaking honesty;--horsing foot on foot?
skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift;
hours, minutes; noon, midnight? and all eyes
blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,
that would unseen be wicked?--is this nothing?

canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,
inclining to them both.--were my wife's liver

i could do this; and that with no rash potion,
but with a ling'ring dram, that should not work
maliciously like poison: but i cannot
believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,
so sovereignly being honourable.
i have lov'd thee,--

leontes.
            make that thy question, and go rot!
dost think i am so muddy, so unsettled,
to appoint myself in this vexation; sully
the purity and whiteness of my sheets,--
which to preserve is sleep; which being spotted
is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps;
give scandal to the blood o' the prince, my son,--
who i do think is mine, and love as mine,--
without ripe moving to't?--would i do this?
could man so blench?

                           i'll draw the curtain:
my lord's almost so far transported that
he'll think anon it lives.

leontes.
                           o sweet paulina,
make me to think so twenty years together!
no settled senses of the world can match
the pleasure of that madness. let't alone.

paulina.
i am sorry, sir, i have thus far stirr'd you: but
i could afflict you further.

leontes.
                             do, paulina;
for this affliction has a taste as sweet
as any cordial comfort.--still, methinks,
there is an air comes from her: what fine chisel
could ever yet cut breath? let no man mock me,
for i will kiss her!

paulina.
                     good my lord, forbear:
the ruddiness upon her lip is wet;
you'll mar it if you kiss it; stain your own
with oily painting. shall i draw the curtain?

leontes.
no, not these twenty years.

perdita.

stand by, a looker on.

paulina.
                       either forbear,
quit presently the chapel, or resolve you
for more amazement. if you can behold it,
i'll make the statue move indeed, descend,
and take you by the hand, but then you'll think,--
which i protest against,--i am assisted
by wicked powers.

leontes.
                  what you can make her do
i am content to look on: what to speak,
i am content to hear; for 'tis as easy
to make her speak as move.

paulina.
                           it is requir'd
you do awake your faith. then all stand still;
or those that think it is unlawful business
i am about, let them depart.

no foot shall stir.

strike all that look upon with marvel. come;

bequeath to death your numbness, for from him
dear life redeems you.--you perceive she stirs.

start not; her actions shall be holy as
you hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her
until you see her die again; for then
you kill her double. nay, present your hand:
when she was young you woo'd her; now in age
is she become the suitor?

paulina.
                             that she is living,
were it but told you, should be hooted at
like an old tale; but it appears she lives,
though yet she speak not.

t? for thou shalt hear that i,--
knowing by paulina that the oracle
gave hope thou wast in being,--have preserv'd
myself to see the issue.

paulina.
                         there's time enough for that;
lest they desire upon this push to trouble
your joys with like relation.--go together,
you precious winners all; your exultation
partake to every one. i, an old turtle,
will wing me to some wither'd bough, and there
my mate, that's never to be found again,
lament till i am lost.

leontes.
                       o peace, paulina!
thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,
as i by thine a wife: this is a match,
and made between's by vows. thou hast found mine;
but how, is to be question'd: for i saw her,
as i thought, dead; and have, in vain, said many
a prayer upon her grave. i'll not seek far,--
for him, i partly know his mind,--to find thee
an honourable husband.--come, camillo,
and take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty
is richly noted, and here justified
