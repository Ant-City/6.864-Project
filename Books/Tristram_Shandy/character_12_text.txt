seem now and then to trifle upon the road,--or should sometimes put on
a fool's cap with a bell to it, for a moment or two as we pass

chapter 1.vii.

in the same village where my father and my mother dwelt, dwelt also a
thin, upright, motherly, notable, good old body of a midwife, who with
the help of a little plain good sense, and some years full employment
in her business, in which she had all along trusted little to her own
efforts, and a great deal to those of dame nature,--had acquired, in her
way, no small degree of reputation in the world:--by which word world,
need i in this place inform your worship, that i would be understood to
mean no more of it, than a small circle described upon the circle of the
great world, of four english miles diameter, or thereabouts,

three or four small children, in her forty-seventh year; and as she was
at that time a person of decent carriage,--grave deportment,--a
woman moreover of few words and withal an object of compassion, whose
distress, and silence under it, called out the louder for a friendly
lift: the wife of the parson of the parish was touched with pity; and
having often lamented an inconvenience to which her husband's flock had
for many years been exposed, inasmuch as there was no such thing as a
midwife, of any kind or degree, to be got at, let the case have been
never so urgent, within less than six or seven long miles riding; which
said seven long miles in dark nights and dismal roads, the country
thereabouts being nothing but a deep clay, was almost equal to fourteen;
and that in effect was sometimes next to having no midwife at all; it
came into her head, that it would be doing as seasonable a kindness to
the whole parish, as to the poor creature herself, to get her a little

chapter 1.x.

whatever degree of small merit the act of benignity in favour of the
midwife might justly claim, or in whom that claim truly rested,--at
first sight seems not very material to this history;--certain however it
was, that the gentlewoman, the parson's wife, did run away at that time
with the whole of it: and yet, for my life, i cannot help thinking but
that the parson himself, though he had not the good fortune to hit upon
the design first,--yet, as he heartily concurred in it the moment it was
laid before him, and as heartily parted with his money to carry it into

guess at the grounds of this procedure.

be it known then, that, for about five years before the date of
the midwife's licence, of which you have had so circumstantial an
account,--the parson we have to do with had made himself a country-talk
by a breach of all decorum, which he had committed against himself, his
station, and his office;--and that was in never appearing better, or
otherwise mounted, than upon a lean, sorry, jackass of a horse, value
about one pound fifteen shillings; who, to shorten all description of
him, was full brother to rosinante, as far as similitude congenial could
make him; for he an

but the truth of the story was as follows: in the first years of this
gentleman's life, and about the time when the superb saddle and bridle
were purchased by him, it had been his manner, or vanity, or call it
what you will,--to run into the opposite extreme.--in the language of
the county where he dwelt, he was said to have loved a good horse, and
generally had one of the best in the whole parish standing in his stable
always ready for saddling: and as the nearest midwife, as i told you,
did not live nearer to the village than seven miles, and in a vile
country,--it so fell out that the poor gentleman was scarce a whole week
together without some piteous application for his beast; and as he was
not an unkind-hearted man, and every case was more pressing and more
distressful than the last;--as much as he loved his beast, he had never
a heart to refuse him; the upshot of which was generally this; that
his horse was either clapp'd, or spavin'd, or greaz'd;--or he w

 his follies, i love more,
and would actually have gone farther to have paid a visit to, than the
greatest hero of antiquity.

but this is not the moral of my story: the thing i had in view was to
shew the temper of the world in the whole of this affair.--for you
must know, that so long as this explanation would have done the parson
credit,--the devil a soul could find it out,--i suppose his enemies
would not, and that his friends could not.--but no sooner did he bestir
himself in behalf of the midwife, and pay the expences of the ordinary's
licence to set her up,--but the whole secret came out; every horse
he had lost, and two horses more than ever he had lost, with all
the circumstances of their destruction, were known and distinctly
remembered.--the story ran like wild-fire.--'the parson had a returning
fit of pride which had just seized him; and he was going to be well
mounted once again in his life; and if it was so, 'twas plain as the sun
at noon-day, he would pocket the expence of the

of the truth of which, this gentleman was a painful example.--but to
know by what means this came to pass,--and to make that knowledge of use
to you, i insist upon it that you read the two following chapters, which
contain such a sketch of his life and conversation, as will carry its
moral along with it.--when this is done, if nothing stops us in our way,
we will go on with the midwife.



chapter 1.xi.

yorick was this parson's name, and, what is very remarkable in it, (as
appears from a most ancient account of the family, wrote upon strong
vellum, and now in perfect preservation) it had been exactly so spelt
for near,--i was within an ace of saying nine hundred years;--but
i would not shake my credit in telling an improbable truth, however
indisputable in itself,--and therefore i shall content myself with only
saying--it had been exactly so spelt, without the least variatio

ten times a day has yorick's ghost the consolation to hear his
monumental inscription read over with such a variety of plaintive tones,
as denote a general pity and esteem for him;--a foot-way crossing the
church-yard close by the side of his grave,--not a passenger goes by
without stopping to cast a look upon it,--and sighing as he walks on,
alas, poor yorick!



chapter 1.xiii.

it is so long since the reader of this rhapsodical work has been parted
from the midwife, that it is high time to mention her again to him,
merely to put him in mind that there is such a body still in the world,
and whom, upon the best judgment i can form upon my own plan at present,
i am going to introduce to him for good and all: but as fresh matter may
be started, and much unexpected business fall out betwixt the reader and
myself, which may require immediate dispatch;--'twas right to take care
that the poor woman should not be lost in the mean time;--because when
she is wanted,

chapter 1.xviii.

as the point was that night agreed, or rather determined, that my mother
should lye-in of me in the country, she took her measures accordingly;
for which purpose, when she was three days, or thereabouts, gone with
child, she began to cast her eyes upon the midwife, whom you have so
often heard me mention; and before the week was well got round, as
the famous dr. manningham was not to be had, she had come to a final
determination in her mind,--notwithstanding there was a scientific
operator within so near a call as eight miles of us, and who, moreover,
had expressly wrote a five shillings book upon the subject of midwifery,
in which he had exposed, not only the blunders of the sisterhood
itself,--but had likewise super-added many curious improvements for

ked a little
grave, as she stood cheapening a silk of five-and-twenty shillings
a yard,--told the mercer, she was sorry she had given him so much
trouble;--and immediately went and bought herself a yard-wide stuff of
ten-pence a yard.--'tis the duplication of one and the same greatness
of soul; only what lessened the honour of it, somewhat, in my mother's
case, was, that she could not heroine it into so violent and hazardous
an extreme, as one in her situation might have wished, because the old
midwife had really some little claim to be depended upon,--as much, at
least, as success could give her; having, in the course of her practice
of near twenty years in the parish, brought every mother's son of them
into the world without any one slip or accident which could fairly be
laid to her account.

these facts, tho' they had their weight, yet did not altogether satisfy
some few scruples and uneasinesses which hung upon my father's spirits
in relation to this choice.--to say nothing of the natural

the world, were, originally, all stolen from that admirable pattern
and prototype of this houshold and paternal power;--which, for a
century, he said, and more, had gradually been degenerating away into
a mix'd government;--the form of which, however desirable in great
combinations of the species,--was very troublesome in small ones,--and
seldom produced any thing, that he saw, but sorrow and confusion.

for all these reasons, private and publick, put together,--my father
was for having the man-midwife by all means,--my mother, by no means.
my father begg'd and intreated, she would for once recede from her
prerogative in this matter, and suffer him to choose for her;--my
mother, on the contrary, insisted upon her privilege in this matter,
to choose for herself,--and have no mortal's help but the old
woman's.--what could my father do? he was almost at his wit's
end;--talked it over with her in all moods;--placed his arguments in
all lights;--argued the matter with her like a christian,--like a

he,--it would not be amiss, brother, if we rung the bell.

pray, what's all that racket over our heads, obadiah?--quoth my
father;--my brother and i can scarce hear ourselves speak.

sir, answered obadiah, making a bow towards his left shoulder,--my
mistress is taken very badly.--and where's susannah running down the
garden there, as if they were going to ravish her?--sir, she is running
the shortest cut into the town, replied obadiah, to fetch the old
midwife.--then saddle a horse, quoth my father, and do you go directly
for dr. slop, the man-midwife, with all our services,--and let him know
your mistress is fallen into labour--and that i desire he will return
with you with all speed.

it is very strange, says my father, addressing himself to my uncle toby,
as obadiah shut the door,--as there is so expert an operator as dr. slop
so near,--that my wife should persist to the very last in this obstinate
humour of hers, in trusting the life of my child,

this hour, it is a thing full as problematical as the subject of the
dissertation itself,--(considering the confusion and distresses of our
domestick misadventures, which are now coming thick one upon the back
of another) whether i shall be able to find a place for it in the third
volume or not.



chapter 1.xxxiii.

it is about an hour and a half's tolerable good reading since my uncle
toby rung the bell, when obadiah was ordered to saddle a horse, and go
for dr. slop, the man-midwife;--so that no one can say, with reason,
that i have not allowed obadiah time enough, poetically speaking, and
considering the emergency too, both to go and come;--though, morally and
truly speaking, the man perhaps has scarce had time to get on his boots.

if the hypercritick will go upon this; and is resolved after all to take
a pendulum, and measure the true distance betwixt the ringing of the
bell, and the rap at the door;--and, after finding it to be no more than

to insult over me for such a breach in the unity, or rather probability
of time;--i would remind him, that the idea of duration, and of its
simple modes, is got merely from the train and succession of our
ideas--and is the true scholastic pendulum,--and by which, as a scholar,
i will be tried in this matter,--abjuring and detesting the jurisdiction
of all other pendulums whatever.

i would therefore desire him to consider that it is but poor eight miles
from shandy-hall to dr. slop, the man-midwife's house:--and that whilst
obadiah has been going those said miles and back, i have brought my
uncle toby from namur, quite across all flanders, into england:--that
i have had him ill upon my hands near four years;--and have since
travelled him and corporal trim in a chariot-and-four, a journey of near
two hundred miles down into yorkshire.--all which put together, must
have prepared the reader's imagination for the entrance of dr. slop upon
the stage,--as much, at least (i hope) as a dance, a s

inventors, at the devil;--it has been the death of thousands,--and it
will be mine in the end.--i would not, i would not, brother toby,
have my brains so full of saps, mines, blinds, gabions, pallisadoes,
ravelins, half-moons, and such trumpery, to be proprietor of namur, and
of all the towns in flanders with it.

obadiah gained the two crowns without dispute;--for he came in jingling,
with all the instruments in the green baize bag we spoke of, flung
across his body, just as corporal trim went out of the room.

it is now proper, i think, quoth dr. slop, (clearing up his looks) as
we are in a condition to be of some service to mrs. shandy, to send up
stairs to know how she goes on.

i have ordered, answered my father, the old midwife to come down to us
upon the least difficulty;--for you must know, dr. slop, continued my
father, with a perplexed kind of a smile upon his countenance, that by
express treaty, solemnly ratified between me and my wife, you are no
more than an auxiliary in this affair,--and not so much as that,--unless
the lean old mother of a midwife above stairs cannot do without
you.--women have their particular fancies, and in points of this nature,
continued my father, where they bear the whole burden, and s

fingers--alas; the nails of his fingers and thumbs were cut close.--the
duce take it! i can make nothing of it either way, cried dr. slop.--the

fellow! i shall never get the knots untied as long as i live.--my mother
gave a groan.--lend me your penknife--i must e'en cut the knots at
last--pugh!--psha!--lord! i have cut my thumb quite across to the very
bone--curse the fellow--if there was not another man-midwife within
fifty miles--i am undone for this bout--i wish the scoundrel hang'd--i
wish he was shot--i wish all the devils in hell had him for a
blockhead--!

my father had a great respect for obadiah, and could not bear to hear
him disposed of in such a manner--he had moreover some little respect
for himself--and could as ill bear with the indignity offered to himself
in it.

had dr. slop cut any part about him, but his thumb--my father had pass'd
it by--his prudence had triumphed: as it was, he wa

the hypothesis is, like most of my father's, singular and ingenious
too;--nor have i any objection to it, but that it overturns my own.



chapter 2.vi.

--bless my soul!--my poor mistress is ready to faint--and her pains are
gone--and the drops are done--and the bottle of julap is broke--and the
nurse has cut her arm--(and i, my thumb, cried dr. slop,) and the
child is where it was, continued susannah,--and the midwife has fallen
backwards upon the edge of the fender, and bruised her hip as black as
your hat.--i'll look at it, quoth dr slop.--there is no need of that,
replied susannah,--you had better look at my mistress--but the midwife
would gladly first give you an account how things are, so desires you
would go up stairs and speak to her this moment.

human nature is the same in all professions.

as the pap of an apple;--the sutures give way--and besides, i could
have extracted by the feet after.--not you, said she.--i rather wish you
would begin that way, quoth my father.

pray do, added my uncle toby.



chapter 2.x.

--and pray, good woman, after all, will you take upon you to say, it
may not be the child's hip, as well as the child's head?--'tis most
certainly the head, replied the midwife. because, continued dr. slop
(turning to my father) as positive as these old ladies generally
are--'tis a point very difficult to know--and yet of the greatest
consequence to be known;--because, sir, if the hip is mistaken for the
head--there is a possibility (if it is a boy) that the forceps....

--what the possibility was, dr. slop whispered very low to my father,
and then to my uncle toby.--there is no such danger, continued he, with
the head.--no, in truth quoth my father--but when your pos

sibility has
taken place at the hip--you may as well take off the head too.

--it is morally impossible the reader should understand this--'tis
enough dr. slop understood it;--so taking the green baize bag in his
hand, with the help of obadiah's pumps, he tripp'd pretty nimbly, for
a man of his size, across the room to the door--and from the door was
shewn the way, by the good old midwife, to my mother's apartments.



chapter 2.xi.

it is two hours, and ten minutes--and no more--cried my father, looking
at his watch, since dr. slop and obadiah arrived--and i know not how it
happens, brother toby--but to my imagination it seems almost an age.

--here--pray, sir, take hold of my cap--nay, take the bell along with
it, and my pantoufles too.

now, sir, they are all at your service; and i freely make you a present
of 'em, on condition you give me all your attention to this chapter.

his faculties upon that variety of subjects which had taken their turn

child was bereft of these!--what a teazing life did she lead herself,
and consequently her foetus too, with that nonsensical anxiety of hers
about lying-in in town? i thought my sister submitted with the greatest
patience, replied my uncle toby--i never heard her utter one fretful
word about it.--she fumed inwardly, cried my father; and that, let me
tell you, brother, was ten times worse for the child--and then! what
battles did she fight with me, and what perpetual storms about the
midwife.--there she gave vent, said my uncle toby.--vent! cried my
