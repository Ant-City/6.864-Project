â€”and how is dick, the solid man?

â€”nothing between himself and heaven, ned lambert answered.

pointing ahead. a few bob a skull. just to keep them going till the
insurance is cleared up.

â€”yes, yes, mr dedalus said dubiously. is that the eldest boy in front?

â€”yes, ned lambert said, with the wifeâ€™s brother. john henry menton is
behind. he put down his name for a quid.

â€”iâ€™ll engage he did, mr dedalus said. i often told poor paddy he ought
to mind that job. john henry is not the worst in the world.

â€”how did he lose it? ned lambert asked. liquor, what?

â€”many a good manâ€™s fault, mr dedalus said with a sigh.

they halted about the door of the mortuary chapel. mr bloom stood behind
the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the
slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar. poor b

â€”as it should be, mr kernan said.

â€”what? eh? corny kelleher said.

mr kernan assured him.

â€”who is that chap behind with tom kernan? john henry menton asked. i
know his face.

ned lambert glanced back.

â€”bloom, he said, madame marion tweedy that was, is, i mean, the soprano.
sheâ€™s his wife.

â€”o, to be sure, john henry menton said. i havenâ€™t seen her for some
time. she was a finelooking woman. i danced with her, wait, fifteen

ned lambert smiled.

â€”yes, he was, he said, in wisdom helyâ€™s. a traveller for blottingpaper.

â€”in godâ€™s name, john henry menton said, what did she marry a coon like
that for? she had plenty of game in her then.

â€”has still, ned lambert said. he does some canvassing for ads.

john henry mentonâ€™s large eyes stared ahead.

the barrow turned into a side lane. a portly man, ambushed among the
grasses, raised his hat in homage. the gravediggers touched their caps.

â€”john oâ€™connell, mr power said pleased. he never forgets a friend.

mr oâ€™connell shook all their hands in silence. mr dedalus said:

â€”i am come to pay you another visit.

â€”my dear simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. i donâ€™t want your
custom at all.

they stopped.

john henry menton stared at him for an instant without moving.

john henry menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed
the nap with care on his coatsleeve. he clapped the hat on his head
again.

â€”itâ€™s all right now, martin cunningham said.

john henry menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.

â€”thank you, he said shortly.

his joyful fingers in the air.

ben dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button
of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the
heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.

stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not
