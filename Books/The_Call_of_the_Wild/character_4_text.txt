on him, and he was
glad each time when he was not selected.

yet his time came, in the end, in the form of a little weazened man who
spat broken english and many strange and uncouth exclamations which buck
could not understand.

“sacredam!” he cried, when his eyes lit upon buck. “dat one dam bully
dog! eh? how moch?”

“three hundred, and a present at that,” was the prompt reply of the man
in the red sweater. “and seem’ it’s government money, you ain’t got no
kick coming, eh, perrault?”

perrault grinned. considering that the price of dogs had been boomed
skyward by the unwonted demand, it was not an unfair sum for so fine
an animal. the canadian government would be no loser, nor would its
despatches travel the slower. perrault knew dogs, and when he looked at
buck he knew that he was one in a thousand--“one in ten t’ousand,” he
commented mentally.

buck saw money pass between them, and was not surprised when curly, a
good-natured newfoundland, and he were led away b

man. that was the last he saw of the man in the red sweater, and as
curly and he looked at receding seattle from the deck of the narwhal, it
was the last he saw of the warm southland. curly and he were taken below
by perrault and turned over to a black-faced giant called francois.
perrault was a french-canadian, and swarthy; but francois was a
french-canadian half-breed, and twice as swarthy. they were a new kind
of men to buck (of which he was destined to see many more), and while
he developed no affection for them, he none the less grew honestly to
respect them. he speedily learned that perrault and francois were fair
men, calm and impartial in administering justice, and too wise in the
way of dogs to be fooled by dogs.

in the ‘tween-decks of the narwhal, buck and curly join

ways get at buck, he growled sharp reproof now
and again, or cunningly threw his weight in the traces to jerk buck
into the way he should go. buck learned easily, and under the combined
tuition of his two mates and francois made remarkable progress. ere they
returned to camp he knew enough to stop at “ho,” to go ahead at “mush,”
 to swing wide on the bends, and to keep clear of the wheeler when the
loaded sled shot downhill at their heels.

“t’ree vair’ good dogs,” francois told perrault. “dat buck, heem pool
lak hell. i tich heem queek as anyt’ing.”

by afternoon, perrault, who was in a hurry to be on the trail with his
despatches, returned with two more dogs. “billee” and “joe” he called
them, two brothers, and true huskies both. sons of the one mother though
they were, they were as different as day and night. billee’s one fault
was his excessive good nature, while joe was the very opposite, sour and
introspective, with a perpetual snarl and a malignant eye. b

teeth scored his flank. but no
matter how spitz circled, joe whirled around on his heels to face
him, mane bristling, ears laid back, lips writhing and snarling, jaws
clipping together as fast as he could snap, and eyes diabolically
gleaming--the incarnation of belligerent fear. so terrible was his
appearance that spitz was forced to forego disciplining him; but to
cover his own discomfiture he turned upon the inoffensive and wailing
billee and drove him to the confines of the camp.

by evening perrault secured another dog, an old husky, long and lean
and gaunt, with a battle-scarred face and a single eye which flashed a
warning of prowess that commanded respect. he was called sol-leks, which
means the angry one. like dave, he asked nothing, gave nothing, expected
nothing; and when he marched slowly and deliberately into their midst,
even spitz left him alone. he had one peculiarity which buck was unlucky
enough to discover. he did not like to be approached on his blind side.
of this offence b

r to the bone for three inches up and down. forever after
buck avoided his blind side, and to the last of their comradeship had
no more trouble. his only apparent ambition, like dave’s, was to be left
alone; though, as buck was afterward to learn, each of them possessed
one other and even more vital ambition.

that night buck faced the great problem of sleeping. the tent, illumined
by a candle, glowed warmly in the midst of the white plain; and when he,
as a matter of course, entered it, both perrault and francois bombarded
him with curses and cooking utensils, till he recovered from his
consternation and fled ignominiously into the outer cold. a chill wind
was blowing that nipped him sharply and bit with especial venom into his
wounded shoulder. he lay down on the snow and attempted to sleep,
but the frost soon drove him shivering to his feet. miserable and
disconsolate, he wandered about among the many tents, only to find that
one place was as cold as another. here and there savage dogs ru

 instinctively, the hair on his neck and shoulders
stood on end, and with a ferocious snarl he bounded straight up into
the blinding day, the snow flying about him in a flashing cloud. ere he
landed on his feet, he saw the white camp spread out before him and knew
where he was and remembered all that had passed from the time he went
for a stroll with manuel to the hole he had dug for himself the night
before.

a shout from francois hailed his appearance. “wot i say?” the dog-driver
cried to perrault. “dat buck for sure learn queek as anyt’ing.”

perrault nodded gravely. as courier for the canadian government, bearing
important despatches, he was anxious to secure the best dogs, and he was
particularly gladdened by the possession of buck.

three more huskies were added to the team inside an hour, making a total
of nine, and before another quarter of an hour had passed they were in
harness and swinging up the trail toward the dyea canon. buck was
glad to be gone, and though the work wa

 it. as francois’s whip backed him up, buck found it
to be cheaper to mend his ways than to retaliate. once, during a brief
halt, when he got tangled in the traces and delayed the start, both
dave and solleks flew at him and administered a sound trouncing. the
resulting tangle was even worse, but buck took good care to keep the
traces clear thereafter; and ere the day was done, so well had he
mastered his work, his mates about ceased nagging him. francois’s whip
snapped less frequently, and perrault even honored buck by lifting up
his feet and carefully examining them.

it was a hard day’s run, up the canon, through sheep camp, past the
scales and the timber line, across glaciers and snowdrifts hundreds of
feet deep, and over the great chilcoot divide, which stands between
the salt water and the fresh and guards forbiddingly the sad and lonely
north. they made good time down the chain of lakes which fills the
craters of extinct volcanoes, and late that night pulled into the huge
camp at

the head of lake bennett, where thousands of goldseekers were
building boats against the break-up of the ice in the spring. buck made
his hole in the snow and slept the sleep of the exhausted just, but all
too early was routed out in the cold darkness and harnessed with his
mates to the sled.

that day they made forty miles, the trail being packed; but the next
day, and for many days to follow, they broke their own trail, worked
harder, and made poorer time. as a rule, perrault travelled ahead of
the team, packing the snow with webbed shoes to make it easier for them.
francois, guiding the sled at the gee-pole, sometimes exchanged places
with him, but not often. perrault was in a hurry, and he prided himself
on his knowledge of ice, which knowledge was indispensable, for the fall
ice was very thin, and where there was swift water, there was no ice at
all.

day after day, for days unending, buck toiled in the traces. always,

a dainty eater, he found that his mates, finishing first, robbed him of
his unfinished ration. there was no defending it. while he was fighting
off two or three, it was disappearing down the throats of the others. to
remedy this, he ate as fast as they; and, so greatly did hunger compel
him, he was not above taking what did not belong to him. he watched and
learned. when he saw pike, one of the new dogs, a clever malingerer and
thief, slyly steal a slice of bacon when perrault’s back was turned,
he duplicated the performance the following day, getting away with the
whole chunk. a great uproar was raised, but he was unsuspected; while
dub, an awkward blunderer who was always getting caught, was punished
for buck’s misdeed.

this first theft marked buck as fit to survive in the hostile northland
environment. it marked his adaptability, his capacity to adjust himself
to changing conditions, the lack of which would have meant swift and
terrible death. it marked, furt

 his way to bully buck, striving constantly to start the
fight which could end only in the death of one or the other. early in
the trip this might have taken place had it not been for an unwonted
accident. at the end of this day they made a bleak and miserable camp
on the shore of lake le barge. driving snow, a wind that cut like a
white-hot knife, and darkness had forced them to grope for a camping
place. they could hardly have fared worse. at their backs rose a
perpendicular wall of rock, and perrault and francois were compelled to
make their fire and spread their sleeping robes on the ice of the lake
itself. the tent they had discarded at dyea in order to travel light.
a few sticks of driftwood furnished them with a fire that thawed down
through the ice and left them to eat supper in the dark.

close in under the sheltering rock buck made his nest. so snug and warm
was it, that he was loath to leave it when francois distributed the
fish which he had first thawed over the fire. but when buck

 he cried to buck. “gif it to heem, by gar! gif it to heem, the dirty

spitz was equally willing. he was crying with sheer rage and eagerness
as he circled back and forth for a chance to spring in. buck was no less
eager, and no less cautious, as he likewise circled back and forth for
the advantage. but it was then that the unexpected happened, the thing
which projected their struggle for supremacy far into the future, past
many a weary mile of trail and toil.

an oath from perrault, the resounding impact of a club upon a bony
frame, and a shrill yelp of pain, heralded the breaking forth of
pandemonium. the camp was suddenly discovered to be alive with skulking
furry forms,--starving huskies, four or five score of them, who had
scented the camp from some indian village. they had crept in while buck
and spitz were fighting, and when the two men sprang among them with
stout clubs they showed their teeth and fought back. they were crazed
by the smell of the food. perrault fou

a husky, and he crunched down through the bone. pike, the malingerer,
leaped upon the crippled animal, breaking its neck with a quick flash of
teeth and a jerk, buck got a frothing adversary by the throat, and was
sprayed with blood when his teeth sank through the jugular. the warm
taste of it in his mouth goaded him to greater fierceness. he flung
himself upon another, and at the same time felt teeth sink into his own
throat. it was spitz, treacherously attacking from the side.

perrault and francois, having cleaned out their part of the camp,
hurried to save their sled-dogs. the wild wave of famished beasts rolled
back before them, and buck shook himself free. but it was only for a
moment. the two men were compelled to run back to save the grub, upon
which the huskies returned to the attack on the team. billee, terrified
into bravery, sprang through the savage circle and fled away over the
ice. pike and dub followed on his heels, with the rest of the team
behind. as buck drew

while billee, the good-natured, with an ear chewed and rent to ribbons,
cried and whimpered throughout the night. at daybreak they limped warily
back to camp, to find the marauders gone and the two men in bad tempers.
fully half their grub supply was gone. the huskies had chewed through
the sled lashings and canvas coverings. in fact, nothing, no matter how
remotely eatable, had escaped them. they had eaten a pair of perrault’s
moose-hide moccasins, chunks out of the leather traces, and even two
feet of lash from the end of francois’s whip. he broke from a mournful
contemplation of it to look over his wounded dogs.

“ah, my frien’s,” he said softly, “mebbe it mek you mad dog, dose many
bites. mebbe all mad dog, sacredam! wot you t’ink, eh, perrault?”

the courier shook his head dubiously. with four hundred miles of trail

as under way, struggling
painfully over the hardest part of the trail they had yet encountered,
and for that matter, the hardest between them and dawson.

the thirty mile river was wide open. its wild water defied the frost,
and it was in the eddies only and in the quiet places that the ice held
at all. six days of exhausting toil were required to cover those thirty
terrible miles. and terrible they were, for every foot of them was
accomplished at the risk of life to dog and man. a dozen times,
perrault, nosing the way broke through the ice bridges, being saved by
the long pole he carried, which he so held that it fell each time across
the hole made by his body. but a cold snap was on, the thermometer
registering fifty below zero, and each time he broke through he was
compelled for very life to build a fire and dry his garments.

nothing daunted him. it was because nothing daunted him that he had been
chosen for government courier. he took all manner of risks, resolutely
thrusting his little w

that they were singed by the flames.

at another time spitz went through, dragging the whole team after him up
to buck, who strained backward with all his strength, his fore paws on
the slippery edge and the ice quivering and snapping all around. but
behind him was dave, likewise straining backward, and behind the sled
was francois, pulling till his tendons cracked.

again, the rim ice broke away before and behind, and there was no escape
except up the cliff. perrault scaled it by a miracle, while francois
prayed for just that miracle; and with every thong and sled lashing and
the last bit of harness rove into a long rope, the dogs were hoisted,
one by one, to the cliff crest. francois came up last, after the sled
and load. then came the search for a place to descend, which descent was
ultimately made by the aid of the rope, and night found them back on the
river with a quarter of a mile to the day’s credit.

by the time they made the hootalinqua and good

the rest of the dogs were in like condition; but perrault, to make
up lost time, pushed them late and early. the first day they covered
thirty-five miles to the big salmon; the next day thirty-five more to
the little salmon; the third day forty miles, which brought them well up
toward the five fingers.

down like a dead dog. hungry as
he was, he would not move to receive his ration of fish, which francois
had to bring to him. also, the dog-driver rubbed buck’s feet for half
an hour each night after supper, and sacrificed the tops of his own
moccasins to make four moccasins for buck. this was a great relief, and
buck caused even the weazened face of perrault to twist itself into a
grin one morning, when francois forgot the moccasins and buck lay on his
back, his four feet waving appealingly in the air, and refused to budge
without them. later his feet grew hard to the trail, and the worn-out
foot-gear was thrown away.

at the pelly one morning, as they were harnessing up, dolly, who had
never been conspicuous for anything, went suddenly mad. she announced
her condition by a long, heartbreaking wolf howl that sent every dog
bristling with fear, then

buck staggered over against the sled, exhausted, sobbing for breath,
helpless. this was spitz’s opportunity. he sprang upon buck, and twice
his teeth sank into his unresisting foe and ripped and tore the flesh to
the bone. then francois’s lash descended, and buck had the satisfaction
of watching spitz receive the worst whipping as yet administered to any
of the teams.

“one devil, dat spitz,” remarked perrault. “some dam day heem keel dat
buck.”

“dat buck two devils,” was francois’s rejoinder. “all de tam i watch dat
buck i know for sure. lissen: some dam fine day heem get mad lak hell
an’ den heem chew dat spitz all up an’ spit heem out on de snow. sure. i
know.”

from then on it was war between them. spitz, as lead-dog and
acknowledged master of the team, felt his supremacy threatened by this
strange southland dog. and strange buck was to him, for of the many
southland dogs he ha

ed and sobbed, it was with the pain of living that
was of old the pain of his wild fathers, and the fear and mystery of the
cold and dark that was to them fear and mystery. and that he should be
stirred by it marked the completeness with which he harked back through
the ages of fire and roof to the raw beginnings of life in the howling
ages.

seven days from the time they pulled into dawson, they dropped down the
steep bank by the barracks to the yukon trail, and pulled for dyea and
salt water. perrault was carrying despatches if anything more urgent
than those he had brought in; also, the travel pride had gripped him,
and he purposed to make the record trip of the year. several things
favored him in this. the week’s rest had recuperated the dogs and put
them in thorough trim. the trail they had broken into the country was
packed hard by later journeyers. and further, the police had arranged
in two or three places deposits of grub for dog and man, and he was
travelling light.

“eh? wot i say? i spik true w’en i say dat buck two devils.” this was
francois’s speech next morning when he discovered spitz missing and buck
covered with wounds. he drew him to the fire and by its light pointed
them out.

“dat spitz fight lak hell,” said perrault, as he surveyed the gaping
rips and cuts.

“an’ dat buck fight lak two hells,” was francois’s answer. “an’ now we
make good time. no more spitz, no more trouble, sure.”

while perrault packed the camp outfit and loaded the sled, the
dog-driver proceeded to harness the dogs. buck trotted up to the place
spitz would have occupied as leader; but francois, not noticing him,
brought sol-leks to the coveted position. in his judgment, sol-leks was
the best lead-dog left. buck sprang upon

clubs. the driver went about his work, and he called to buck when he was
ready to put him in his old place in front of dave. buck retreated two
or three steps. francois followed him up, whereupon he again retreated.
after some time of this, francois threw down the club, thinking that
buck feared a thrashing. but buck was in open revolt. he wanted, not to
escape a clubbing, but to have the leadership. it was his by right. he
had earned it, and he would not be content with less.

perrault took a hand. between them they ran him about for the better
part of an hour. they threw clubs at him. he dodged. they cursed him,
and his fathers and mothers before him, and all his seed to come after
him down to the remotest generation, and every hair on his body and drop
of blood in his veins; and he answered curse with snarl and kept out of
their reach. he did not try to run away, but retreated around and around
the camp, advertising plainly that when his desire was met, he would
come in and

francois sat down and scratched his head. perrault looked at his watch
and swore. time was flying, and they should have been on the trail an
hour gone. francois scratched his head again. he shook it and grinned
sheepishly at the courier, who shrugged his shoulders in sign that they
were beaten. then francois went up to where sol-leks stood and called
to buck. buck laughed, as dogs laugh, yet kept his distance. francois
unfastened sol-leks’s traces and put him back in his old place. the team

there was no place for buck save at the front. once more francois
called, and once more buck laughed and kept away.

“t’row down de club,” perrault commanded.

francois complied, whereupon buck trotted in, laughing triumphantly,
and swung around into position at the head of the team. his traces were
fastened, the sled broken out, and with both men running they dashed out
on to the river trail.

highly as the dog-driver had forevalued buck, with his two devils, he
found, while the day was yet young, that he had undervalued. at a bound
buck took up the duties of leadership; and where judgment was required,

weight, and cut him up till he ceased snapping and began to whine for
mercy.

the general tone of the team picked up immediately. it recovered its
old-time solidarity, and once more the dogs leaped as one dog in the
traces. at the rink rapids two native huskies, teek and koona, were
added; and the celerity with which buck broke them in took away
francois’s breath.

“nevaire such a dog as dat buck!” he cried. “no, nevaire! heem worth one
t’ousan’ dollair, by gar! eh? wot you say, perrault?”

and perrault nodded. he was ahead of the record then, and gaining day
by day. the trail was in excellent condition, well packed and hard, and
there was no new-fallen snow with which to contend. it was not too cold.
the temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there the whole
trip. the men rode and ran by turn, and the dogs were kept on the jump,
with but infrequent stoppages.

the thirty mile river was comparatively coated with ice, and they
covered in one day going out what ha

n they made a sixty-mile dash from the foot of lake le barge to
the white horse rapids. across marsh, tagish, and bennett (seventy miles
of lakes), they flew so fast that the man whose turn it was to run
towed behind the sled at the end of a rope. and on the last night of the
second week they topped white pass and dropped down the sea slope with
the lights of skaguay and of the shipping at their feet.

it was a record run. each day for fourteen days they had averaged forty
miles. for three days perrault and francois threw chests up and down the
main street of skaguay and were deluged with invitations to drink, while
the team was the constant centre of a worshipful crowd of dog-busters
and mushers. then three or four western bad men aspired to clean out
the town, were riddled like pepper-boxes for their pains, and public
interest turned to other idols. next came official orders. francois
called buck to him, threw his arms around him, wept over him. and that

most salient thing about him. it advertised his callowness--a callowness
sheer and unutterable. both men were manifestly out of place, and why
such as they should adventure the north is part of the mystery of things
that passes understanding.

buck heard the chaffering, saw the money pass between the man and the
government agent, and knew that the scotch half-breed and the mail-train
drivers were passing out of his life on the heels of perrault and
francois and the others who had gone before. when driven with his mates
to the new owners’ camp, buck saw a slipshod and slovenly affair, tent
half stretched, dishes unwashed, everything in disorder; also, he saw a
woman. “mercedes” the men called her. she was charles’s wife and hal’s
sister--a nice family party.

and load the sled. there was a great deal of effort about their manner,

thornton’s head around, and he would return the gaze, without speech,
his heart shining out of his eyes as buck’s heart shone out.

for a long time after his rescue, buck did not like thornton to get out
of his sight. from the moment he left the tent to when he entered it
again, buck would follow at his heels. his transient masters since he
had come into the northland had bred in him a fear that no master could
be permanent. he was afraid that thornton would pass out of his life as
perrault and francois and the scotch half-breed had passed out. even in
the night, in his dreams, he was haunted by this fear. at such times
he would shake off sleep and creep through the chill to the flap of
the tent, where he would stand and listen to the sound of his master’s
breathing.

but in spite of this great love he bore john thornton, which seemed
to bespeak the soft civilizing influence, the strain of the primitive,
which the northland had aroused in him, remained alive and active.
