"you all needs to go to bed." dilsey said. she came and lifted me down and 
wiped my face and hands with a warm cloth. "versh, can you get them up

"it's too early to go to bed now." caddy said. "we dont ever have to go to

hair was on the pillow. the fire didn't reach it, but it shone on her hand, 
where her rings were jumping.  

"come and tell mother goodnight." caddy said. we went to the bed. the 
fire went out of the mirror. father got up from the bed and lifted me up 
and mother put her hand on my head.  
"what time is it." mother said. her eyes were closed.  
"ten minutes to seven." father said. "it's too early for him to go to bed." 
mother said. "he'll wake up at daybreak, and i simply cannot bear another 
day like today."  
"there, there." father said. he touched mother's face.  
"i know i'm nothing but a burden to you. mother said. "but i'll be gone 
soon. then you will be rid of my bothering."

lurching onto the rolling cylinder with a plopping sound and a long jarring 
noise as the door rolled back and two men emerged, carrying a shell. they 
set it in the water and a moment later bland came out, with the sculls. he 
wore flannels, a gray jacket and a stiff straw hat. either he or his mother 
had read somewhere that oxford students pulled in flannels and stiff hats, 

so early one march they bought gerald a one pair shell and in his flannels 
and stiff hat he went on the river. the folks at the boathouse threatened to 
call a policeman, but he went anyway. his mother came down in a hired 
auto, in a fur suit like an arctic explorer's, and saw him off in a twenty-five 
mile wind and a steady drove of ice floes like dirty sheep. ever since then i

      "i'm sorry now," she says. she quit, then her eyes turned kind of funny 
and i says to myself if you cry here in this car, on the street, i'll whip you. 
i'll wear you out. lucky for her she didn't, so i turned her wrists loose and 
drove on. luckily we were near an alley, where i could turn into the back 
street and dodge the square. they were already putting the tent up in 
beard's lot. earl had already given me the two passes for our show 
windows. she sat there with her face turned away, chewing her lip. "i'm 
sorry now," she says. "i dont see why i was ever born."  
      "and i know of at least one other person that dont understand all he 
knows about that," i says. i stopped in front of the school house. the bell 
had rung, and the last of them were just going in. "you're on time for once, 
anyway," i says. "are you going in there and stay there, or am i coming

i'd rather be in hell than anywhere where you are."  
      "if i hear one more time that you haven't been to school, you'll wish you 
were in hell," i says. she turned and ran on across the yard. "one more 
time, remember," i says. she didn't look back.  
      i went to the postoffice and got the mail and drove on to the store and 
parked. earl looked at me when i came in. i gave him a chance to say 
something about my being late, but he just said,  
      "those cultivators have come. you'd better help uncle job put them 
up."  
      i went on to the back, where old job was uncrating them, at the rate of 
about three bolts to the hour.  
      "you ought to be working for me," i says. "every other no-count nigger 
in town eats in my kitchen."  
      "i works to suit de man whut pays me sat'dy night," he says. "when i

 no answer to the last two letters i wrote her, though the 
check in the second one was cashed with the other check. is she sick? let 
me know at once or i'll come there and see for myself. you promised you 
would let me know when she needed things. i will expect to hear from you 
before the 10th. no you'd better wire me at once. you are opening my 
letters to her. i know that as well as if i were looking at you. you'd better 
wire me at once about her to this address."  
 
     about that time earl started yelling at job, so i put them away and went 
over to try to put some life into him. what this country needs is white 
labor. let these dam trifling niggers starve for a couple of years, then 
they'd see what a soft thing they have.  
      along toward ten oclock i went up front. there was a drummer there. it 
was a couple of minutes to ten, and i invited him up the street to get a 
dope. we got to talking about crops.

      another report came in. it was down a point.  
      "jason's selling," hopkins says. "look at his face."  
      "that's all right about what i'm doing," i says. "you boys follow your 
own judgment. those rich new york jews have got to live like everybody 
else," i says.  
      i went on back to the store. earl was busy up front. i went on back to 
the desk and read lorraine's letter. "dear daddy wish you were here. no 
good parties when daddys out of town i miss my sweet daddy." i reckon 
she does. last time i gave her forty dollars. gave it to her. i never promise 
a woman anything nor let her know what i'm going to give her. that's the 
only way to manage them. always keep them guessing. if you cant think of 
any other way to surprise them, give them a bust in the jaw.

he'll be if he was to die and find out there's not any heaven, when he thinks 
about that five thousand a year. like i say, he'd better go on and die now 
and save money.  
      when it was burned good i was just about to shove the others into my 
coat when all of a sudden something told me to open quentin's before i 
went home, but about that time earl started yelling for me up front, so i 
put them away and went and waited on the dam redneck while he spent 
fifteen minutes deciding whether he wanted a twenty cent hame string or a 
thirty-five cent one.  
      "you'd better take that good one," i says. "how do you fellows ever 
expect to get ahead, trying to work with cheap equipment?"  
      "if this one aint any good," he says, "why have you got it on sale?"

next year when you have to buy a new outfit."  
      "i aint makin next year's crop yit," he says. finally i got rid of him, but 
every time i took that letter out something would come up. they were all in 
town for the show, coming in in droves to give their money to something 
that brought nothing to the town and wouldn't leave anything except what 
those grafters in the mayor's office will split among themselves, and earl 

chasing back and forth like a hen in a coop, saying "yes, ma'am, mr 
compson will wait on you. jason, show this lady a churn or a nickel's worth 
of screen hooks."  
      well, jason likes work. i says no i never had university advantages 
because at harvard they teach you how to go for a swim at night without 
knowing how to swim and at sewanee they dont even teach you what water 
is. i says you might send me to the state university; maybe i'll learn how to 
stop my clock with a nose spray

      "wait," she says, catching my arm. "i've stopped. i wont again. you 
promise, jason?" she says, and me feeling her eyes almost like they were 
touching my face. "you promise? mother--that--money if sometimes she 
needs things-- if i send checks for her to you, other ones besides those, 
you'll give them to her? you wont tell? you'll see that she has things like 
other girls?"  
      "sure," i says. "as long as you behave and do like i tell you."  
      and so when earl came up front with his hat on he says, "i'm going to 
step up to rogers' and get a snack. we wont have time to go home to 
dinner, i reckon."  
      "what's the matter we wont have time?" i says.  
      "with this show in town and all," he says. "they're going to give an 
afternoon performance too, and they'll all want to get done trading in time 
to go to it. so we'd better just run up to rogers'."  
      "all right," i says. "it's your stomach. if you want to make a slave of

what she needs than you are, that haven't even got a home. "if you want to 
give her money," i says, "you send it to mother, dont be giving it to her. if 
i've got to run this risk every few months, you'll have to do like i say, or it's 
out."  
      and just about the time i got ready to begin on it because if earl 
thought i was going to dash up the street and gobble two bits worth of 
indigestion on his account he was bad fooled. i may not be sitting with my 
feet on a mahogany desk but i am being payed for what i do inside this 
building and if i cant manage to live a civilised life outside of it i'll go 
where i can. i can stand on my own feet; i dont need any man's mahogany

already, like as not, and then i found that all the blanks were gone. i 
remembered then that i had aimed to get some more, but it was too late 
now, and then i looked up and there she came. in the back door. i heard 
her asking old job if i was there. i just had time to stick them in the drawer 
and close it.  
      she came around to the desk. i looked at my watch.  
      "you been to dinner already?" i says. "it's just twelve; i just heard it

      "yes," i says. "that's one thing you'll have to learn if you never learn 
anything else. sign it now, and get on out of here."  
      she signed it. "where's the money?" she says. i took the order and 
blotted it and put it in my pocket. then i gave her the ten dollars.  
      "now you go on back to school this afternoon, you hear?" i says. she 
didn't answer. she crumpled the bill up in her hand like it was a rag or 
something and went on out the front door just as earl came in. a customer 
came in with him and they stopped up front. i gathered up the things and 
put on my hat and went up front.  
      "been much busy?" earl says.  
      "not much," i says. he looked out the door.  
      "that your car over yonder?" he says. "better not try to go out home to 
dinner. we'll likely have another rush just before the show opens. get you a 
lunch at rogers' and put a ticket in the drawer."  
      "much obliged," i says. "i can still manage to feed myself, i rec

   and right there he'd stay, watching that door like a hawk until i came 
through it again. well, he'd just have to watch it for a while; i was doing the 

best i could. the time before i says that's the last one now; you'll have to 
remember to get some more right away. but who can remember anything 
in all this hurrah. and now this dam show had to come here the one day i'd 
have to hunt all over town for a blank check, besides all the other things i 
had to do to keep the house running, and earl watching the door like a 
hawk.  
      i went to the printing shop and told him i wanted to play a joke on a 
fellow, but he didn't have anything. then he told me to have a look in the 
old opera house, where somebody had stored a lot of papers and junk out 
of the old merchants' and farmers' bank when it failed, so i dodged up a 
few more alleys so earl couldn't see me and finally found old man 
simmons and got the key from him and went up there and dug around. at 
last i found a pad on a sai

just because of father. then she would begin to cry and say it was her own 
flesh and blood so i just says all right. have it your way. i can stand it if 
you can.  
      i fixed the letter up again and glued it back and went out.  
      "try not to be gone any longer than you can help," earl says.  
      "all right," i says. i went to the telegraph office. the smart boys were all 
there.  
      "any of you boys made your million yet?" i says.  
      "who can do anything, with a market like that?" doc says.  
      "what's it doing?" i says. i went in and looked. it was three points 
under the opening. "you boys are not going to let a little thing like the 
cotton market beat you, are you?" i says. "i thought you were too smart for 
that."

      "well," i. o. snopes says. "i've picked hit; i reckon taint no more than 
fair fer hit to pick me once in a while."  
      so i left them buying and selling among themselves at a nickel a point. i 
found a nigger and sent him for my car and stood on the corner and 
waited. i couldn't see earl looking up and down the street, with one eye on 
the clock, because i couldn't see the door from here. after about a week he 
got back with it.  
      "where the hell have you been?" i says. "riding around where the 
wenches could see you?"  
      "i come straight as i could," he says. "i had to drive clean around the

something level to walk on, that wouldn't jolt me every step, but when i got 
into the woods it was full of underbrush and i had to twist around through 
it, and then i came to a ditch full of briers. i went along it for a while, but it 
got thicker and thicker, and all the time earl probably telephoning home 
about where i was and getting mother all upset again.  
      when i finally got through i had had to wind around so much that i had 
to stop and figure out just where the car would be. i knew they wouldn't be 
far from it, just under the closest bush, so i turned and worked back 
toward the road. then i couldn't tell just how far i was, so i'd have to stop 
and listen, and then with my legs not using so much blood, it all would go 
into my head like it would explode
