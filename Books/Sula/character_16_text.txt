d the village into a town and the
streets of medallion were hot and dusty with progress,
those heavy trees that sheltered the shacks up in the
bottom were wonderful to see. and the hunters who went
there sometimes wondered in private if maybe the white
farmer was right after all. maybe it was the bottom of
heaven. the black people would have disagreed, but they
had no time to think about it. they were mightily
preoccupied with earthly things--and each other, wondering
even as early as 1920 what shadrack was all about, what
that little girl sula who grew into a woman in their town was
all about, and what they themselves were all about, tucked
up there in the bottom.
1919
except for world war ii, nothing ever interfered with the
celebration of national suicide day. it had taken place
every january third since 1920, although shadrack, its
founder, was for many years the only celebrant. blasted and
permanently astonished by the events of 1917, he had
returned to medallion handsome but ravaged, and

years back before he went off to war. a young man of
hardly twenty, his head full of nothing and his mouth
recalling the taste of lipstick, shadrack had found himself in
december, 1917, running with his comrades across a field
in france. it was his first encounter with the enemy and he
didn't know whether his company was running toward them
or away. for several days they had been marching,
keeping close to a stream that was frozen at its edges. at
one point they crossed it, and no sooner had he stepped
foot on the other side than the day was adangle with shouts
and explosions. shellfire was all around him, and though he
knew that this was s

net fixed, deep in the great sweep of men flying across
this field. wincing at the pain in his foot, he turned his head
a little to the right and saw the face of a soldier near him fly
off. before he could register shock, the rest of the soldier's
head disappeared under the inverted soup bowl of his
helmet. but stubbornly, taking no direction from the brain,
the body of the headless soldier ran on, with energy and
grace, ignoring altogether the drip and slide of brain tissue
down its back. when shadrack opened his eyes he was
propped up in a small bed. before him on a tray was a
large tin plate divided into three triangles. in one triangle
was rice, in another meat, and in the third stewed
tomatoes. a small round depression held a cup of whitish
liquid. shadrack stared at the soft colors that filled these
triangles: the lumpy whiteness of rice, the quivering blood
tomatoes, the grayish-brown meat. all their repugnance
was contained in the neat balance of the triangles--a
balance that soothed h

he tried the other and found it
also. slowly he directed one hand toward the cup and, just
as he was about to spread his fingers, they began to grow
in higgledypiggledy fashion like jack's beanstalk all over
the tray and the bed. with a shriek he closed his eyes and
thrust his huge growing hands under the covers. once out
of sight they seemed to shrink back to their normal size. but
the yell had brought a male nurse. "private? we're not
going to have any trouble today, are we? are we, private?"
shadrack looked up at a balding man dressed in a
greencotton jacket and trousers. his hair was parted low on
the right side so that some twenty or thirty yellow hairs could
discreetly cover the nakedness of his head. "come on.
pick up that spoon. pick it up, private. nobody is going to
feed you forever." sweat slid from shadrack's armpits
down his sides. he could not bear to see his hands grow
again and he was frightened of the voice in the apple-green
suit. "pick it up, i said. there's no point to this

... " the nurse
reached under the cover for shadrack's wrist to pull out the
monstrous hand. shadrack jerked it back and overturned
the tray. in panic he raised himself to his knees and tried to
fling off and away his terrible fingers, but succeeded only in
knocking the nurse into the next bed. when they bound
shadrack into a straitjacket, he was both relieved and
grateful, for his hands were at last hidden and confined to
whatever size they had attained. laced and silent in his
small bed, he tried to tie the loose cords in his mind. he
wanted desperately to see his own face and connect it with
the word "private"--the word the nurse (and the others who
helped bind him) had called him. "private" he thought was
something secret, and he wondered why they looked at him
and called him a secret. still, if his hands

 behaved as they
had done, what might he expect from his face? the fear
and longing were too much for him, so he began to think of
other things. that is, he let his mind slip into whatever cave
mouths of memory it chose. he saw a window that looked
out on a river which he knew was full of fish. someone was
speaking softly just outside the door... shadrack's earlier
violence had coincided with a memorandum from the
hospital executive staff in reference to the distribution of
patients in high-risk areas. there was clearly a demand for
space. the priority or the violence earned shadrack his
release, $217 in cash, a full suit of clothes and copies of
very official-looking papers. when he stepped out of the
hospital door the grounds overwhelmed him: the cropped
shrubbery, the edged lawns, the undeviating walks.
shadrack looked at the cement stretches

leading clearheadedly to some presumably desirable
destination. there were no fences, no warnings, no
obstacles at all between concrete and green grass, so one
could easily ignore the tidy sweep of stone and cut out in
another direction--a direction of one's own. shadrack stood
at the foot of the hospital steps watching the heads of trees
tossing ruefully but harmlessly, since their trunks were
rooted too deeply in the earth to threaten him. only the
walks made him uneasy. he shifted his weight, wondering
how he could get to the gate without stepping on the
concrete. while plotting his course-where he would have to
leap, where to skirt a clump of bushes--a loud guffaw
startled him. two men were going up the steps. then he
noticed that there were many people abou

t, and that he
was just now seeing them, or else they had just
materialized. they were thin slips, like paper dolls floating
down the walks. some were seated in chairs with wheels,
propelled by other paper figures from behind. all seemed
to be smoking, and their arms and legs curved in the
breeze. a good high wind would pull them up and away and
they would land perhaps among the tops of the trees.
shadrack took the plunge. four steps and he was on the
grass heading for the gate. he kept his head down to avoid
seeing the paper people swerving and bending here and
there, and he lost his way. when he looked up, he was
standing by a low red building separated from the main
building by a covered walkway. from somewhere came a
sweetish smell which reminded him of something painful.
he looked around for the gate and saw that he had gone
directly away from it in his complicated journey over the
grass. ju

uttered their eyes at
what they took to be a drunken man. the sun was already
directly over his head when he came to a town. a few
blocks of shaded streets and he was already at its heart--a
pretty, quietly regulated downtown. exhausted, his feet
clotted with pain, he sat down at the curbside to take off his
shoes. he closed his eyes to avoid seeing his hands and
fumbled with the laces of the heavy high-topped shoes. the
nurse had tied them into a double knot, the way one does
for children, and shadrack, long unaccustomed to the
manipulation of intricate things, could not get them loose.
uncoordinated, his fingernails tore away at the knots. he
fought a rising hysteria that was not merely anxiety to free
his aching feet; his very life depended on the release of the
knots. suddenly without raising his eyelids, he began to cry.

acknowledge the fact that he didn't even know who or what

ing nothing nothing to do... he was sure
of one thing only: the unchecked monstrosity of his hands.
he cried soundlessly at the curbside of a small midwestern
town wondering where the window was, and the river, and
the soft voices just outside the door... through his tears he
saw the fingers joining the laces, tentatively at first, then
rapidly. the four fingers of each hand fused into the fabric,
knotted themselves and zigzagged in and out of the tiny
eyeholes. by the time the police drove up, shadrack was
suffering from a blinding headache, which was not abated
by the comfort he felt when the policemen pulled his hands
away from what he thought was a permanent entanglement
with his shoelaces. they took him to jail, booked him for
vagrancy and intoxication, and locked him in a cell. lying
on a cot, shadrack could only stare helplessly at the wall,
so paralyzing was the pain in his head. he lay in this agony
for a long while and then realized he was staring at the
painted-over letters of a com

covered his head, rendering the water
dark enough to see his reflection. there in the toilet water
he saw a grave black face. a black so definite, so
unequivocal, it astonished him. he had been harboring a
skittish apprehension that he was not real--that he didn't
exist at all. but when the blackness greeted him with its
indisputable presence, he wanted nothing more. in his joy
he took the risk of letting one edge of the blanket drop and
glanced at his hands. they were still. courteously still.
shadrack rose and returned to the cot, where he fell into the
first sleep of his new life. a sleep deeper than the hospital
drugs; deeper than the pits of plums, steadier than the
condor's wing; more tranquil than the curve of eggs. the
sheriff looked through the bars at the young man with the
matted hair. he had read through his prisoner's papers and
hailed a farmer. when shadrack awoke, the sheriff handed
him back his papers and escorted him to the back of a
wagon. shadrack got in and in less than thr

ee hours he was
back in medallion, for he had been only twenty-two miles
from his window, his river, and his soft voices just outside
the door. in the back of the wagon, supported by sacks of
squash and hills of pumpkins, shadrack began a struggle
that was to last for twelve days, a struggle to order and
focus experience. it had to do with making a place for fear
as a way of controlling it. he knew the smell of death and
was terrified of it, for he could not anticipate it. it was not
death or dying that frightened him, but the unexpectedness
of both. in sorting it all out, he hit on the notion that if one
day a year were devoted to it, everybody could get it out of
the way and the rest of the year would be safe and free.

 in
this manner he instituted national suicide day. on the third
day of the new year, he walked through the bottom down
carpenter's road with a cowbell and a hangman's rope
calling the people together. telling them that this was their
only chance to kill themselves or each other. at first the
people in the town were frightened; they knew shadrack
was crazy but that did not mean that he didn't have any
sense or, even more important, that he had no power. his
eyes were so wild, his hair so long and matted, his voice
was so full of authority and thunder that he caused panic on
the first, or charter, national suicide day in 1920. the next
one, in 1921, was less frightening but still worrisome. the
people had seen him a year now in between. he lived in a
shack on the riverbank that had once belonged to his
grandfather long time dead. on tues

suicide days, the grown people looked out from behind
curtains as he rang his bell; a few stragglers increased their
speed, and little children screamed and ran. the tetter
heads tried goading him (although he was only four or five
years older then they) but not for long, for his curses were
stingingly personal. as time went along, the people took
less notice of these january thirds, or rather they thought
they did, thought they had no attitudes or feelings one way
or another about shadrack's annual solitary parade. in fact
they had simply stopped remarking on the holiday because
they had absorbed it into their thoughts, into their language,
into their lives. someone said to a friend, "you sure was a
long time delivering that baby. how long was you in labor?"
and the friend answered, "'bout three days. the pains
started on suicide day and kept up till the following
sunday. was borned on sunday. all my boys is sunday

and his sweetheart answered, "ok, but make sure it ain't
on suicide day. i ain't 'bout to be listening to no cowbells
whilst the weddin's going on." somebody's grandmother
said her hens always started a laying of double yolks right
after suicide day. then reverend deal took it up, saying
the same folks who had sense enough to avoid shadrack's
call were the ones who insisted on drinking themselves to
death or womanizing themselves to death. "may's well go
on with shad and save the lamb the trouble of
redemption." easily, quietly, suicide day became a part of
the fabric of life up in the bottom of medallion, ohio.

get him to participate in the church activities. they just
listened to him sing, wept and thought very graphically of
their own imminent deaths. the people either accepted his
own evaluation of his life, or were indifferent to it. there
was, however, a measure of contempt in their indifference,
for they had little patience with people who took themselves
that seriously. seriously enough to try to die. and it was
natural that he, after all, became the first one to join
shadrack--tar baby and the deweys--on national suicide
day. under eva's distant eye, and prey to her
idiosyncrasies, her own children grew up stealthily: pearl

about minor troubles, her husband's job and who the
children favored. hannah married a laughing man named

onsequence of all that ice was a wretched
thanksgiving of tiny tough birds, heavy pork cakes, and
pithy sweet potatoes. by the time the ice began to melt and
the first barge was seen shuddering through the ice skim
on the river, everybody under fifteen had croup, or scarlet
fever, and those over had chilblains, rheumatism, pleurisy,
earaches and a world of other ailments. still it was not
those illnesses or even the ice that marked the beginning of
the trouble, that self-fulfilled prophecy that shadrack carried
on his tongue. as soon as the silvering began, long before
the cider cracked the jugs, there was something wrong. a
falling away, a dislocation was taking place. hard on the
heels of the general relief that sula's death brought a
restless irritability took hold. teapot, for example, went into
the kitchen and asked his mother for some sugar-butterbread.
she got up to fix it and found that she had no butter,
only oleomargarine. too tired to mix the saffron-colored
powder into the hard cak

_yes'm, thank you,__ out of those sullen mouths. just as
the ice lingered inoctober, so did the phlegm of
december--which explained the enormous relief brought on
by the first three days of 1941. it was as though the season
had exhausted itself, for on january first the temperature
shot up to sixty-one degrees and slushed the whiteness
overnight. on january second drab patches of grass could
be seen in the fields. on january third the sun came out--
and so did shadrack with his rope, his bell and his childish
dirge. he had spent the night before watching a tiny moon.
the people, the voices that kept him company, were with
him less and less. now there were long periods when he
heard nothing except the wind in the trees and the plop of
buckeyes on the earth. in the winter, when the fish were too
hard to get to, he did picking-up jobs for small
businessmen (nobody would have him in or even near their
homes), and thereby continued to have enough money for
liquor.

 yet the drunk times were becoming deeper but more
seldom. it was as though he no longer needed to drink to
forget whatever it was he could not remember. now he
could not remember that he had ever forgotten anything.
perhaps that was why for the first time after that cold day in
france he was beginning to miss the presence of other
people. shadrack had improved enough to feel lonely. if he
was lonely before, he didn't know it because the noise he
kept up, the roaring, the busyness, protected him from
knowing it. now the compulsion to activity, to filling up the
time when he was not happily fishing on the riverbank, had
dwindled. he sometimes fell asleep before he got drunk;
sometimes spent whole days looking at the river and the
sky; and more and more he relinquished the military habits
of cleanliness in his shack. once a bird flew into h

one of the robins during the time there was a plague of
them. it stayed, looking for an exit, for the better part of an
hour. when the bird found the window and flew away,
shadrack was grieved and actually waited and watched for
its return. during those days of waiting, he did not make his
bed, or sweep, or shake out the little rag-braid rug, and
almost forgot to slash with his fish knife the passing day on
his calendar. when he did return to housekeeping, it was
not with the precision he had always insisted upon. the
messier his house got, the lonelier he felt, and it was harder
and harder to conjure up sergeants, and orderlies, and
invading armies; harder and harder to

looked at and fondled the one piece of evidence that he
once had a visitor in his house: a child's purple-and-white
belt. the one the little girl left behind when she came to see
him. shadrack remembered the scene clearly. he had
stepped into the door and there was a tear-stained face
turning, turning toward him; eyes hurt and wondering; mouth
parted in an effort to ask a question. she had wanted
something--from him. not fish, not work, but something only
he could give. she had a tadpole over her eye (that was
how he knew she was a friend--she had the mark of the fish
he loved), and one of her braids had come undone. but

his rope was improperly tied; his bell had a tinny
unimpassioned sound. his visitor was dead and would
come no more. years later people would quarrel about who
had been the first to go. most folks said it was the deweys,
but one or two knew better, knew that dessie and ivy had
been first. said that dessie had opened her door first and
stood there shielding her eyes from the sun while watching
shadrack coming down the road. she laughed. maybe the
sun; maybe the clots of green showing in the hills promising
so much; maybe the contrast between shadrack's doomy,
gloomy bell glinting in all that sweet sunshine. maybe just a
brief moment, for once, of not feeling fear, of looking at
death in the sunshine and being unafraid. she laughed.

and called their children out of the road. it frightened him,
this glee, but he stuck to his habit--singing his song, ringing
his bell and holding fast to his rope. the deweys with their

teen-agers got into the mood and, laughing, dancing,
calling to one another, formed a pied piper's band behind
shadrack. as the initial group of about twenty people
passed more houses, they called to the people standing in
doors and leaning out of windows to join them; to help them
open further this slit in the veil, this respite from anxiety,
from dignity, from gravity, from the weight of that very adult
pain that had undergirded them all those years before.

fear their straightened hair would beat them home. sadly,
heavily, nel left the colored part of the cemetery. further
along the road shadrack passed her by. a little shaggier, a
little older, still energetically mad, he looked at the woman
hurrying along the road with the sunset in her face. he
stopped. trying to remember where he had seen her
before. the effort of recollection was too much for him and
he moved on. he had to haul some trash out at sunnydale
