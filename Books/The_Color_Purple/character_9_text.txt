dear celie,


i keep thinking it's too soon to look for a letter from you. and i know how busy you is with all mr. ' s children. but i

miss you so much. please write to me, soon as you have a chance. every day i think about you. every minute.

the lady you met in town is name corrine. the little girl's name is olivia. the husband's name is samuel. the little boy's
name is adam. they are sanctified religious and very good to me. they live in a nice house next to the church where
samuel preaches, and we spend a lot of time on church business. i say "we" because they always try to include me in
everything they do, so i don't feel so left out and alone.

but god, i miss you, celie. i think about the time you laid yourself down for me. i love you with all my heart.

your sister,

dear celie,


by now i am almost crazy. i think albert told me the truth, and that he is not giving you my letters. the only person i can
think of who could help us out is pa, but i don't want him to know where i am.

i asked samuel if he would visit you and mr. , just to see how you are. but he says he can't risk putting himself

between man and wife, especially when he don't know them. and i felt bad for having to ask him, he and corrine have
been so nice to me. but my heart is breaking. it is breaking because i can not find any work in this town, and i will have to
leave. after i leave, what will happen to us? how will we ever know what is going on?

corrine and samuel and the children are part of a group of people called missionaries, of the american and african
missionary society. they have ministered to the indians out west and are ministering to the poor of this town. all in
preparation for the work they feel they were bor

 you feel so ashamed you couldn't even talk about it to god, you had to
write it, bad as you thought your writing was. well, now i know what you meant. and whether god will read letters or no,
i know you will go on writing them; which is guidance enough for me. anyway, when i don't write to you i feel as bad as i
do when i don't pray, locked up in myself and choking on my own heart. i am so lonely, celie.

the reason i am in africa is because one of the missionaries that was supposed to go with corrine and samuel to help
with the children and with setting up a school suddenly married a man who was afraid to let her go, and refused to come
to africa with her. so there they were, all set to go, with a ticket suddenly available and no missionary to give it to. at the
same time, i wasn't able to find a job anywhere around town. but i never dreamed of going to africa! i never even
thought about it as a real place, though samuel and corrine and even the children talked about it all the time.

beasley used to say it was a place overrun with savages who didn't wear clothes. even corrine and samuel thought
like this at times. but they know a lot more about it than miss beasley or any of our other teachers, and besides, they
spoke of all the good things they could do for the downtrodden people from whom they sprang. people who need christ
and good medical advice.

one day i was in town with corrine and we saw the mayor's wife and her maid. the mayor's wife was shopping— going in
and out of stores— and her maid was waiting for her on the street and taking the packages. i don't know if you have ever
seen the mayor's wife. she looks like a wet cat. and there was her maid looking like the very last person in the world
you'd expect to see waiting on anybody, and in particular not on anybody that looked like that.

i spoke. but just speaking to me seemed to make her embarrassed and she sudd

all that night i thought about it. then samuel and corrine told me what they'd heard about how she got to be the mayor's
maid. that she attacked the mayor, and then the mayor and his wife took her from the prison to work in their home.

in the morning i started asking questions about africa and started reading all the books samuel and corrine have on the
subject.

did you know there were great cities in africa, greater than milledgeville or even atlanta, thousands of years ago? that
the egyptians who built the pyramids and enslaved the israelites were

i hadn't realized i was so ignorant, celie. the little i knew about my own self wouldn't have filled a thimble! and to think
miss beasley always said i was the smartest child she ever taught! but one thing i do thank her for, for teaching me to
learn for myself, by reading and studying and writing a clear hand. and for keeping alive in me somehow the desire to
know. so when corrine and samuel asked me if i would come with them and help them build a school in the middle of
africa, i said yes. but only if they would teach me everything they knew to make me useful as a missionary and someone
they would not be ashamed to call a friend. they agreed to this condition, and my real education began at that time.

they have been as good as their word. and i study everything night and day.

in the beginning was that they could not have children. and then, they say, "god" sent them olivia and adam.

i wanted to say, "god" has sent you their sister and aunt, but i didn't. yes, their children, sent by "god" are your children,
celie. and they are being brought up in love, christian charity and awareness of god. and now "god" has sent me to
watch over them, to protect and cherish them. to lavish all the love i feel for you on them

while we were in town corrine bought cloth to make me two sets of traveling outfits. one olive green and the other gray.
long gored skirts and suit jackets to be worn with white cotton blouses and lace-up boots. she also bought me a woman's
boater with a checkered band.

although i work for corrine and samuel and look after the children, i don't feel like a maid. i guess this is because they
teach me, and i teach the children and there's no beginning or end to teaching and learning and working— it all runs
together.

when we got to new york we were tired and dirty. but so excited! listen, celie, new york is a beautiful city. and colored

living in houses that are finer than any white person's house down home. there are more than a hundred churches! and
we went to every one of them. and i stood before each congregation with samuel and corrine and the children and
sometimes our mouths just dropped open from the generosity and goodness of those harlem people's hearts. they live in
such beauty and dignity, celie. and they give and give and then reach down and give some more, when the name "africa"
is mentioned.

they love africa. they defend it at the drop of a hat. and speaking of hats, if we had passed our hats alone they would not
have been enough to hold all the donations to our enterprise. even the children dredged up their pennie

dear celie,


samuel is a big man. he dresses in black almost all the time, except for his white clerical collar. and he is black. until you
see his eyes you think he's somber, even mean, but he has the most thoughtful and gentle brown eyes. when he says
something it settles you, because he never says anything off the top of his head and he's never out to dampen your spirit
or to hurt. corrine is a lucky woman to have him as her husband.

but let me tell you about the ship! the ship, called the malaga, was three stories high! and we had rooms (called cabins)
with beds. oh, celie, to lie in a bed in the middle of the ocean! and the ocean! celie, more water than you can imagine in
one place. it took us two weeks to cross it! and then we were in england, which is a country full of white people and some

don't want to work to help build the country up. it was the first time i'd heard a black man use that word. i knew that to
white people all colored people are natives. but he cleared his throat and said he only meant "native" to liberia. i did not
see any of these "natives" in his cabinet. and none of the cabinet members' wives could pass for natives. compared to
them in their silks and pearls, corrine and i were barely dressed, let alone dressed for the occasion. but i think the women
we saw at the palace spend a lot of their time dressing. still, they look dissatisfied. not like the cheery schoolteachers we
saw only by chance, as they herded their classes down to the beach for a swim.

president tubman doesn't own them. people in a place called holland do. the people who make dutch chocolate. and
there are overseers who make sure the people work hard, who live in stone houses in the corners of the fields.

did i mention my first sight of the african coast? something struck in me, in my soul, celie, like a large bell, and i just
vibrated. corrine and samuel felt the same. and we kneeled down right on deck and gave thanks to god for letting us see
the land for which our mothers and fathers cried— and lived and died— to see again.

oh, celie! will i ever be able to tell you all?

i dare not ask, i know. but leave it all to god.

 coming out of little round huts with something that i thought was straw
on top of them but is really a kind of leaf that grows everywhere. they pick it and dry it and lay it so it overlaps to make
the roof rainproof. this part is women's work. menfolks drive the stakes for the hut and sometimes help build the walls
with mud and rock from the streams.

you never saw such curious faces as the village folks surrounded us with. at first they just looked. then one or two of the
women touched my and corrine's dresses. my dress was so dirty round the hem from dragging on the ground for three
nights of cooking round a campfire that i was ashamed of myself. but then i took a look at the dresses they were wearing.
most looked like they'd been drug across the yard by the pigs. and they don't fit. so then they moved up a little
bit— nobody saying a word yet— and touched our hair. then looked down at our shoes. we looked at joseph. then he

samuel asked if they'd ever seen the white woman missionary twenty miles farther on, and he said no. twenty miles
through the jungle is a very long trip. the men might hunt up to ten miles around the village, but the women stayed close
to their huts and fields.

then one of the women asked a question. we looked at joseph. he said the woman wanted to know if the children
belonged to me or to corrine or to both of us. joseph said they belonged to corrine. the woman looked us both over, and
said something else. we looked at joseph. he said the woman said they both looked like me. we all laughed politely.

then another woman had a question. she wanted to know if i was also samuel's wife.

joseph said no, that i was a missionary just like samuel and corrine. then someone said they never suspected
missionaries could have children. then another said he never dreamed missionaries could be black.

ion. little heads began to pop from behind mothers' skirts and over big sisters'
shoulders. and we were sort of swept along among the villagers, about three hundred of them, to a place without walls
but with a leaf roof, where we all sat down on the ground, men in front, women and children behind. then there was
loud whispering among some very old men who looked like the church elders back home— with their baggy trousers and
shiny, ill-fitting coats— did black missionaries drink palm wine?

corrine looked at samuel and samuel looked at corrine. but me and the children were already drinking it, because
someone had already put the little brown clay glasses in our hands and we were too nervous not to start sipping.

we got there around four o'clock, and sat under the leaf canopy until nine. we had our first meal there, a chicken and
groundnut (peanut) stew which we ate with our fingers. but mostly we listened to songs and watched dances that raised
lots of dust.

that is as high as they can think, i tell her.

you will grow up to be a strong christian woman, i tell her. someone who helps her people to advance. you will be a

will tashi? she wants to know.

yes, i tell her, tashi too.

corrine said to me this morning, nettie, to stop any kind of confusion in the minds of these people, i think we should call
one another brother and sister, all the time. some of them can't seem to get it through their thick skulls that you are not
samuel's other wife. i don't like it, she said.

sweet and good-natured. but sometimes i sense her spirit is being tested and that someth

bit of fussing over them. but i never try to take corrine's place.

well, she never borrowed anything of mine because i don't have much. but i'm all the time borrowing something of hers.

she said yes.

peculiar here. we of course have all of these pictures hung in the school and many of christ behind the altar at the
church. that is enough, i think, though samuel and corrine have pictures and relics (crosses) in their hut as well.

dear celie,


tashi's mother and father were just here. they are upset because she spends so much time with olivia. she is changing,
becoming quiet and too thoughtful, they say. she is becoming someone else; her face is beginning to show the spirit of
one of her aunts who was sold to the trader because she no longer fit into village life. this aunt refused to marry the man
chosen for her. refused to bow to the chief

ness. oh, yes. we have seen it
all before. you christians come here, try hard to change us, get sick and go back to england, or wherever you come from.
only the trader on the coast remains, and even he is not the same white man, year in and year out. we know because we
send him women.

tashi is very intelligent, i said. she could be a teacher. a nurse. she could help the people in the village.

there is no place here for a woman to do those things, he said.

then we should leave, i said. sister corrine and i.

no, no, he said.

teach only the boys? i asked.

yes, he said, as if my question was agreement.

there is a way that the men speak to women that reminds me too much of pa. they listen just long enough to issue
instructions. they don't even look at women when women are speaking. they look at the ground and bend their heads
toward the ground. the women also do not "look in a man's face" as they say. to "look in a man's face" is a brazen thing
to do. they look instead at his feet or his kn

sound of dragging. then a scent, some days, of smoke. but now, after two months, during which i or the children or
corrine has been sick, all we hear is chopping and scraping and dragging. and every day we smell smoke.

today one of the boys in my afternoon class burst out, as he entered. the road approaches! the road approaches! he had
been hunting in the forest with his father and seen it.

every day now the villagers gather at the edge of the village near the cassava fields, and watch the building of the road.
and watching them, some on their stools and some squatted down on their haunches, all chewing cola nuts

and love living in huts. they are excited by the hunting expertise of the men and the self-sufficiency of the women in
raising their crops. no matter how down i may be, and sometimes i get very down indeed, a hug from olivia or adam
completely restores me to the level of functioning, if nothing else. their mother and i are not as close as we once were,
but i feel more like their aunt than ever. and the three of us look more and more alike every day.

about a month ago, corrine asked me not to invite samuel to my hut unless she were present. she said it gave the
villagers the wrong idea. this was a real blow to me because i treasure his company. since corrine almost never visits me
herself i will have hardly anybody to talk to, just in friendship. but the children still come and sometimes spend the night
when their parents want to be alone. i love those times. we roast groundnuts on my stove, sit on the floor and study
maps of all the countries in the world. sometimes

we will fight the white man, they said.

but the white man is not alone, said the chief. he has brought his army.

that was several months ago, and so far nothing has happened. the people live like ostriches, never setting foot on the
new road if they can help it, and never, ever, looking towards the coast. we have built another church and school. i have
another hut. and so we wait.

meanwhile, corrine has been very ill with african fever. many missionaries in the past have died from it.

but the children are fine. the boys now accept olivia and tashi in class and more mothers are sending their daughters to
school. the men do not like it: who wants a wife who knows everything her husband knows? they fume. but the women
have their ways, and they love their children, even their girls.

oh, celie, this thing has been gnawing away at her all these years!

he said: i apologize for this. sister nettie, please forgive us.

two years before she died she had a baby girl that she was too sick to keep. then a baby boy. these children were named

this is samuel's story, almost word for word.

the stranger who married the widow was someone samuel had run with long before he found christ. when the man
showed up at samuel's house with first olivia and then adam, samuel felt not only unable to refuse the children, but as if
god had answered his and corrine's prayers.

he never told corrine about the man or about the children's "mother" because he hadn't wanted any sadness to cloud
her happiness.

but then, out of nowhere, i appeared. he put two and two together, remembered that his old running buddy had always
been a scamp, and took me in without any questions. which, to tell the truth, had always puzzled me, but i put it down to
christian charity. corrine had asked me once whether i was running away from home. but i explained i was a big girl no

i woke up this morning bound to tell corrine and samuel everything. i went over to their hut and pulled up a stool next to
corrine's bed. she's so weak by now that all she can do is look unfriendly— and i could tell i wasn't welcome.

i said, corrine, i'm here to tell you and samuel the truth.

she said, samuel already told me. if the children yours, why didn't you just say so?

samuel said. now, honey.

she said. don't now honey me. nettie swore on the bible to tell me the truth. to tell god the truth, and she lied.

corrine, i said, i

what do i know about pregnancy, she said. i never experienced it myself. for all i know, women may be able to rub out all
the signs.

they can't rub out stretch marks, i said. stretch marks go right into the skin, and a woman's stomach stretches enough so
that it keeps a little pot, like all the women have here.

she turned her face to the wall.

corrine, i said, i'm the children's aunt. their mother is my older sister, celie.

then i told them the whole story. only corrine was still not convinced.

you and samuel telling so many lies, who can believe anything you say? she asked.

you've got to believe nettie, said samuel. though the part about you and pa was a real shock to him.

then i remembered what you told me about seeing corrine and samuel and olivia in town, when she was buying cloth to
make her and olivia dresses, and how you sent me t

every day for the past week i've been trying to get corrine to remember meeting you in town. i know if she can just recall
your face, she will believe olivia (if not adam) is your child. they think olivia looks like me, but that is only because i look
like you. olivia has your face and eyes, exactly. it amazes me that corrine didn't see the resemblance.

how the store smelled like peanut shells?

she says she remembers all this, but no me

then i remember her quilts. the olinka men make beautiful quilts which are full of animals and birds and people. and as
soon as corrine saw them, she began to make a quilt that alternated one square of appliqued figures with one nine-patch
block, using the clothes the children had outgrown, and some of her old dresses.

i went to her trunk and started hauling out quilts.

don't touch my things, said corrine. i'm not gone yet.

i held up first one and then another to the light, trying to find the first one i remembered her making. and trying to
remember, at the same time, the dresses she and olivia were wearing the first months i lived with them.

aha, i said, when i found what i was looking for, and laid the quilt across the bed.

do you remember buying this cloth? i asked, pointing to a flowered square. and what about this checkered bird?

don't cry. don't cry, i said. my sister was glad to see olivia with you. glad to see her alive. she thought both her children
were dead.

about her private parts, her mother and father will be annoyed, and it is very important to olivia not to be looked upon as
an outsider. although the one ritual they do have to celebrate womanhood is so bloody and painful, i forbid olivia to even
think about it.

do you remember how scared i was when it first happened to me? i thought i had cut myself. but thank god you were
there to tell me i was all right.

we buried corrine in the olinka way, wrapped in barkcloth under a large tree. all of her sweet ways went with her. all of
her education and a heart intent on doing good. she taught me so much! i know i will miss her always. the children were
stunned by their mother's death. they knew she was very sick, but death is not something they think about in relation to
their parents or themselves. it was a strange little procession. all of us in our white robes and with our faces painted

i did not enjoy watching samuel speaking to either of them. the one who hung on every word, or the one who looked
through samuel's head.

samuel gave me all of corrine's clothes, and i need them, though none of our clothing is suitable in this climate. this is
true even of the clothing the africans wear. they used to wear very little, but the ladies of england introduced the mother

rrine's things. at the same time, i dreaded putting them on. i remembered
her saying we should stop wearing each other's clothes. and the memory pained me.

are you sure sister corrine would want this? i asked samuel.

yes, sister nettie, he said. try not to hold her fears against her. at the end she understood, and believed. and
forgave— whatever there was to forgive.

i should have said something sooner, i said.

he asked me to tell him about you, and the words poured out like water. i was dying to tell someone about us. i told him
about my letters to you every christmas and easter, and about how much it would have meant to us if he had gone to see
you after i left. he wa

ything else for miles around. including every last stalk of roofleaf.

after nearly unbearable weeks in the hot sun, we were awakened one morning by the sound of a large truck pulling into
the compound. it was loaded with sheets of corrugated tin.

celie, we had to pay for the tin. which exhausted what meager savings the olinka had, and nearly wiped out the money
samuel and i had managed to put by for the education of the children once we return home. which we have planned to
do each year since corrine died, only to find ourselves more and more involved in the olinka's problems. nothing could
be uglier than corrugated tin, celie. and as they struggled to put up roofs of this cold, hard, glittery, ugly metal the
women raised a deafening ululation of sorrow that echoed off the cavern walls for miles around. it was on this day that
the olinka acknowledged at least temporary defeat.

though the olinka no longer ask anything of us, beyond teaching their children— because they can see how powerle

ish and how they reminded her of the roofleaf huts of the olinka. they are square,
though, she'd say. more like our church and school than like our homes, which olivia thought very strange.

when we reached england, samuel and i presented the olinka's grievances to the bishop of the english branch of our
church, a youngish man wearing spectacles who sat thumbing through a stack of samuel's yearly reports. instead of even
mentioning the olinka the bishop wanted to know how long it had been since corrine's death, and why, as soon as she
died, i had not returned to america.

i really did not understand what he was driving at.

appearances, miss , he said. appearances. what must the natives think?

about what? i asked.

come, come, he said.


we behave as brother and sister to each other, said samuel.

the bishop smirked. yes, he did.

i felt my face go hot.

well, there was more of this, but why burden you with it? you know what some people are, and the bishop was one of
them. samuel and i left

bies. and then there are the youngsters who want bicycles and british clothes. mirrors and shiny
cooking pots. they want to work for the white people in order to have these things.

things! he said, in disgust. bloody things'.

well, we have a month here anyway, i said, let's make the most of it.

because we had spent so much of our money on tin roofs and the voyage over, it had to be a poor man's month in
england. but it was a very good time for us. we began to feel ourselves a family, without corrine. and people meeting us
on the street never failed (if they spoke to us at all) to express the sentiment that the children looked just like the two of
us. the children began to accept this as natural, and began going out to view the sights that interested them, alone.
leaving their father and me to our quieter, more sedate pleasures, one of which was simple conversation.

samuel, of course, was born in the north, in new york, and grew up and was educated there. he met corrine through his
aunt wh

o had been a missionary, along with corrine's aunt, in the belgian congo. samuel frequently accompanied his
aunt althea to atlanta, where corrine's aunt theodosia lived.

these two ladies had been through marvelous things together, said samuel, laughing. they'd been attacked by lions,
stampeded by elephants, flooded out by rains, made war on by "natives." the tales they told were simply incredible.
there they sat on a heavily antimacassared horsehair sofa, two prim and proper ladies in ruffles and lace, telling these
stupendous stories over tea.

corrine and i as teenagers used to attempt to stylize these tales into comics. we called the

we made fun of them, but we were riveted on their adventures, and on the ladies' telling of them. they were so staid
looking. so proper. you really couldn't imagine them actually building— with their own hands— a school in the bush. or
battling reptiles. or unfriendly africans who thought, since they were wearing dresses with things that looked like wings
behind, they should be able to fly.

bush? corrine would snicker to me or me to her. and just the sound of the word would send us off into quiet hysteria,
while we calmly sipped our tea. because of course they didn't realize they were being funny, and to us they were, very.
and of course the prevailing popular view of africans at that time contributed to our feeling of amusement. not only
were africans savages, they were bumbling, inept savages, rather like their bumbling, inept brethren at home. but we
carefully, not to say studiously, avoided

 this very apparent connection.

corrine's mother was a dedicated housewife and mother who disliked her more adventurous sister. but she never
prevented corrine from visiting. and when corrine was old enough, she sent her to spelman seminary where aunt
theodosia had gone. this was a very interesting place. it was started by two white missionaries from new england who
used to wear identical dresses. started in a church basement, it soon moved up to army barracks. eventually these two
ladies were able to get large sums of money from some of the richest men in america, and so the place grew. buildings,
trees. girls were taught everything: reading, writing, arithmetic, sewing, cleaning,

 to resettlement camps in oklahoma. a third of them died on the way. but many of
them refused to leave georgia. they hid out as colored people and eventually blended with us. many of these mixed-race
people were at spelman. some remembered who they actually were, but most did not. if they thought about it at all (and
it became harder to think about indians because there were none around) they thought they were yellow or reddish
brown and wavy haired because of white ancestors, not indian.

even corrine thought this, he said. and yet, i always felt her indianness. she was so quiet. so reflective. and she could
erase herself, her spirit, with a swiftness that truly startled, when she knew the people around her could not respect it.

it did not seem hard for samuel to talk about corrine while we were in england. it wasn't hard for me to listen.

it all seems so improbable, he said. here i am, an aging man whose dreams of helping people have been just that, dreams.

 would have laughed at ourselves, twenty years a fool of the west, or mouth and roofleaf disease:
a treatise on the futility of the tropics. etc. etc. we failed so utterly, he said. we became as comical as althea and theodosia.
i think her awareness of this fueled corrine's sickness. she was far more intuitive than i. her gift for understanding people
much greater. she used to say the olinka resented us, but i wouldn't see it. but they do, you know.

no, i said, it isn't resentment, exactly. it really is indifference. sometimes i feel our position is like that of flies on an
elephant's hide.

i remember once, before corrine and i were married, samuel continued. aunt theodosia had one of her at-homes. she
had them every thursday. she'd invited a lot of "serious y

african adventures, leading up to the time king leopold of belgium presented her with a medal. well edward, or perhaps
his name was bill, was a very impatient sort. you saw it in his eyes, you could see it in the way he moved his body. he was
never still. as aunt theodosia got closer to the part about her surprise and joy over receiving this medal— which validated
her service as an exemplary missionary in the king's colony— duboyce's foot began to pat the floor rapidly and
uncontrollably. corrine and i looked at each other in alarm. clearly this man had heard this tale before and was not
prepared to endure it a second time.

madame, he said, when aunt theodosia finished her story and flashed her famous medal around the room, do you realize
king leopold cut the hands off workers who, in the opinion of his plantation overseers, did not fulfill their rubber quota?
rather than cherish that medal, madame, you should regard it as a symbol of your unwitting complicity with this despot

the very texture of his palms. the pink of his inner lip. i love his big nose. i love his brows. i love his feet. and i love his
dear eyes in which the vulnerability and beauty of his soul can be plainly read.

the children saw the change in us immediately. i'm afraid, my dear, we were radiant.

we love each other dearly, samuel told them, with his arm around me. we intend to marry.

but before we do, i said, i must tell you something about my life and about corrine and about someone else. and it was
then i told them about you, celie. and about their mother corrine's love of them. and about being their aunt.

but where is this other woman, your sister? asked olivia.

i explained your marriage to mr. as best i could.

adam was instantly alarmed. he is a very sensitive soul who hears what isn't said as clearly as what is.

we will go back to america soon, said samuel to reassure him, and see about her.

the children stood up with us in a simple church ceremo

you can imagine. we read the papers and magazines from home, play any number of african games with the children.
rehearse the african children in parts of shakespeare's plays— adam was always very good as hamlet giving his to be or
not to be soliloquy. corrine had firm notions of what the children should be taught and saw to it that every good work
advertised in the papers became part of their library. they know many things, and i think will not find american society
such a shock, except for the hatred of black people, which is also very clear in all the news. but i worry about their very
