sebastian.
by your patience, no. my stars shine darkly over me: the
malignancy of my fate might perhaps distemper yours; therefore i
shall crave of you your leave that i may bear my evils alone: it
were a bad recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you.

rceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not
extort from me what i am willing to
keep in; therefore it charges me in manners the rather to express
myself. you must know of me then, antonio, my name is sebastian,
which i called roderigo. my father was that sebastian of
messaline whom i know you have heard of. he left behind him
myself and a sister, both born in an hour. if the heavens had
been pleas'd, would we had so ended! but you, sir, alter'd that;
for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was
my sister drown'd.

antonio.
alas the day!

many accounted beautiful; but, tho

boldly publish her: she bore mind that envy could not but call
fair. she is drown'd already, sir, with salt water, though i seem
to drown her remembrance again with more.

antonio.
pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.

sebastian.
o good antonio, forgive me your trouble!

antonio.
if you will not murder me for my love, let me be your servant.

sebastian.
if you will not undo what you have done, that is, kill him whom
you have recover'd, desire it not. fare ye well at once; my bosom
is full of kindness, and i am yet so near the manners of my
mother that upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell
tales of me. i am bound to the count orsino's court; farewell.

point of the letter that i dropp'd to betray him; he does smile
his face into more lines than is in the new map, with the
augmentation of the indies: you have not seen such a thing as 't
is.  i  can hardly forbear hurling things at him. i know my lady
will strike him; if she do, he'll smile, and take 't for a great
favour.

i would not by my will have troubled you;
but, since you make your pleasure of your pains,
i will no further chide you.

antonio.
i could not stay behind you: my desire,
more sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;
and not all love to see you, though so much
as might have drawn one to a longer voyage,
but jealousy what might befall your travel,
being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,
unguided and unfriended, often prove
rough and unhospitable. my will

my kind antonio,
i can no other answer make but thanks,
and thanks, and ever thanks; too oft good turns
are shuffl'd off with such uncurrent pay:
but, were my worth as is my conscience firm,
you should find better dealing. what's to do?
shall we go see the reliques of this town?

antonio.
to-morrow, sir; best first go see your lodging.

sebastian.
i am not weary, and 't is long to night;
i pray you, let us satisfy our eyes
with the memorials and the things of fame
that do renown this city.

antonio.
would you'd pardon me;
i do not without danger walk these streets.
once, in a sea-fight, 'gainst the count his galleys
i did some service; of such note indeed,
that, were i ta'en here, it would scarce be answer'd.

th' offence is not of such a bloody nature;
albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
might well have given us bloody argument.
it might have since been answer'd in repaying
what we took from them; which, for traffic's sake,
most of our city did: only myself stood out;
for which, if i be lapsed in this place,
i shall pay dear.

sebastian.
do not then walk too open.

antonio.
it doth not fit me. hold, sir, here's my purse.
in the south suburbs, at the elephant,
is best to lodge. i will bespeak our diet,
whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge
with viewing of the town; there shall you have me.

sebastian.
why i your purse?

antonio.
haply your eye shall light upon some toy
you have desire to purchase; and your store,
i think, is not for idle markets, sir.

i'll be your purse-bearer, and leave you

i must obey. [to viola] this comes with seeking you:
but there's no remedy; i shall answer it.
what will you do, now my necessity
makes me to ask you for my purse? it grieves me
much more for what i cannot do for you
than what befalls myself. you stand amaz'd;
but be of comfort.

i 'll make division of my present with you:

antonio.
will you deny me now?
is 't possible that my deserts to you
can lack persuasion? do not tempt my misery,
lest that it make me so unsound a man
as to upbraid you with those kindnesses
that i have done for you.

viola.
i know of none;
nor know i you by voice or any feature.
i hate ingratitude more in a man
than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,
or any taint of vice whose strong corruption
inhabits our frail blood.

i snatch'd one half out of the jaws of death,
reliev'd him with such sanctity of love,
and to his image, which methought did promise
most venerable worth, did i devotion.

what 's that to us? the time goes by; away!

antonio.
but o how vile an idol proves this god!
thou hast, sebastian, done good feature shame.
in nature there 's no blemish but the mind;
none can be call'd deform'd but the unkind.
virtue is beauty; but the beauteous evil
are empty trunks, o'erflourish'd by the devil.

this is the air; that is the glorious sun;
this pearl she gave me, i do feel 't and see 't;
and though 't is wonder that enwraps me thus,
yet 't is not madness. where 's antonio, then?
i could not find him at the elephant:
yet there he was; and there i found this credit,
that he did range the town to seek me out.
his counsel now might do me golden service;
for though my soul disputes well with my sense,
that this may be some error, but no madness,
yet doth this accident and flood of fortune
so far exceed all instance, all discourse,
that i am ready to distrust mine eyes
and wrangle with my reason, that persuades me
to any other trust but that i am mad,

duke.
that face of his i do remember well;
yet, when i saw it last, it was besmear'd
as black as vulcan in the smoke of war.
a baubling vessel was he captain of,
for shallow draught and bulk unprizable;
with which such scathful grapple did he make
with the most noble bottom of our fleet
that very envy and the tongue of loss
cried fame and honour on him. what 's the matter?

orsino, this is that antonio
that took the phoenix and her fraught from candy;

but in conclusion put strange speech upon me;
i know not what 't was but distraction.

duke.
notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!
what foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies,
whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,
hast made thine enemies?

antonio.
orsino, noble sir,
be pleas'd that i shake off these names you give me;
antonio never yet was thief or pirate,
though, i confess, on base and ground enough,
orsino's enemy. a witchcraft drew me hither:
that most ingrateful boy there by your side,
from the rude sea's enrag'd and foamy mouth
did i redeem; a wreck past hope he was.
his life i gave him, and did thereto ad
my love, without retention or restraint,
all his in dedication; for his sake
did i expose myself, pure for his love

into the danger of this adverse town;
drew to defend him when he was beset:
where being apprehended, his false cunning,
not meaning to partake with me in danger,
taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,
and grew a twenty years removed thing
while one would wink; denied me mine own purse,
which i had recommended to his use
not half an hour before.

viola.
how can this be?

duke.
when came he to this town?

to-day, my lord; and for three months before,
no interim, not a minute's vacancy,
both day and night did we keep company.
