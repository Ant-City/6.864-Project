ckmann. surely it is not worth bothering about! cannot you and thomas share the credit as brothers?

peter stockmann. i should have thought so; but apparently some people are not satisfied with a share.

mrs. stockmann. what nonsense! you and thomas get on so capitally together. (listens.) there he is at last, i think. (goes out and opens the door leading to the hall.)

dr. stockmann (laughing and talking outside). look here—here is another guest for you, katherine. isn't that jolly! come in, captain horster; hang your coat up on this peg. ah, you don't wear an overcoat. just think, katherine; i met him in the street and could hardly persuade him to come up! (captain horster comes into the room and greets mrs. stockmann. he is followed by dr. stockmann.) come along in, boys. they are ravenously hungry again, you know. come along, captain horster; you must have a slice of beef. (pushes horster into the dining-room. ejlif and morten go in after them.)

mrs. stockmann. but, thomas, don't you see—?

truce.

billing. that is just what it is! that word sums up the situation.

dr. stockmann. we must remember that peter is a lonely man, poor chap. he has no home comforts of any kind; nothing but everlasting business. and all that infernal weak tea wash that he pours into himself! now then, my boys, bring chairs up to the table. aren't we going to have that toddy, katherine?

mrs. stockmann (going into the dining-room). i am just getting it.

dr. stockmann. sit down here on the couch beside me, captain horster. we so seldom see you. please sit down, my friends. (they sit down at the table. mrs. stockmann brings a tray, with a spirit-lamp, glasses, bottles, etc., upon it.)

mrs. stockmann. there you are! this is arrack, and this is rum, and this one is the brandy. now every one must help themselves.

dr. stockmann (taking a glass). we will. (they all mix themselves some toddy.) and let us have the cigars. ejlif, you know where the box is. and you, morten, can fetch my pipe. (the two boys go into the r

right.) i have a suspicion that ejlif pockets a cigar now and then!—but i take no notice of it. (calls out.) and my smoking-cap too, morten. katherine, you can tell him where i left it. ah, he has got it. (the boys bring the various things.) now, my friends. i stick to my pipe, you know. this one has seen plenty of bad weather with me up north. (touches glasses with them.) your good health! ah, it is good to be sitting snug and warm here.

mrs. stockmann (who sits knitting). do you sail soon, captain horster?

horster. i expect to be ready to sail next week.

mrs. stockmann. i suppose you are going to america?

horster. yes, that is the plan.

mrs. stockmann. then you won't be able to take part in the coming election?

horster. is there going to be an election?

billing. didn't you know?

horster. no, i don't mix myself up with those things.

billing. but do you not take an interest in public affairs?

horster. no, i don't know anything about politics.

billing. all the same, one ought to vote, at

at; but i will stand at the window and watch you, that's what i will do.

dr. stockmann (puts his arms round her and kisses her). thank you, my dear! now you and i are going to try a fall, my fine gentlemen! i am going to see whether a pack of cowards can succeed in gagging a patriot who wants to purify society! (he and his wife go out by the street door.)

peter stockmann (shaking his head seriously). now he has sent her out of her senses, too.




act iv

(scene.—a big old-fashioned room in captain horster's house. at the back folding-doors, which are standing open, lead to an ante-room. three windows in the left-hand wall. in the middle of the opposite wall a platform has been erected. on this is a small table with two candles, a water-bottle and glass, and a bell. the room is lit by lamps placed between the windows. in the foreground on the left there is a table with candles and a chair. to the right is a door and some chairs standing near it. the room is nearly filled with a crowd of townspeop

key tricks of yours lead to?

dr. stockmann. i have done my duty.

morten kiil. what was that you said about the tanneries at molledal?

dr. stockmann. you heard well enough. i said they were the source of all the filth.

morten kiil. my tannery too?

dr. stockmann. unfortunately your tannery is by far the worst.

morten kiil. are you going to put that in the papers?

dr. stockmann. i shall conceal nothing.

morten kiil. that may cost you dearly, stockmann. (goes out.)

a stout man (going up to captain horster, without taking any notice of the ladies). well, captain, so you lend your house to enemies of the people?

horster. i imagine i can do what i like with my own possessions, mr. vik.

the stout man. then you can have no objection to my doing the same with mine.

horster. what do you mean, sir?

the stout man. you shall hear from me in the morning. (turns his back on him and moves off.)

petra. was that not your owner, captain horster?

horster. yes, that was mr. vik the shipowner.

ne together; but now that this report about me is being spread, she dare not keep me on any longer.

mrs. stockmann. and someone who had been a guest of ours! that shows you the return you get for your hospitality, thomas!

dr. stockmann. we won't live in such a disgusting hole any longer. pack up as quickly as you can, katherine; the sooner we can get away, the better.

mrs. stockmann. be quiet—i think i hear someone in the hall. see who it is, petra.

petra (opening the door). oh, it's you, captain horster! do come in.

horster (coming in). good morning. i thought i would just come in and see how you were.

dr. stockmann (shaking his hand). thanks—that is really kind of you.

mrs. stockmann. and thank you, too, for helping us through the crowd, captain horster.

petra. how did you manage to get home again?

horster. oh, somehow or other. i am fairly strong, and there is more sound than fury about these folk.

dr. stockmann. yes, isn't their swinish cowardice astonishing? look here, i will show

hings. and yet they stood out there bawling and swearing that they would do me some violence; but as for doing anything—you don't see much of that in this town.

horster. just as well for you this time, doctor!

dr. stockmann. true enough. but it makes one angry all the same; because if some day it should be a question of a national fight in real earnest, you will see that public opinion will be in favour of taking to one's heels, and the compact majority will turn tail like a flock of sheep, captain horster. that is what is so mournful to think of; it gives me so much concern, that—. no, devil take it, it is ridiculous to care about it! they have called me an enemy of the people, so an enemy of the people let me be!

mrs. stockmann. you will never be that, thomas.

dr. stockmann. don't swear to that, katherine. to be called an ugly name may have the same effect as a pin-scratch in the lung. and that hateful name—i can't get quit of it. it is sticking here in the pit of my stomach, eating into

me like a corrosive acid. and no magnesia will remove it.

petra. bah!—you should only laugh at them, father,

horster. they will change their minds some day, doctor.

mrs. stockmann. yes, thomas, as sure as you are standing here.

dr. stockmann. perhaps, when it is too late. much good may it do them! they may wallow in their filth then and rue the day when they drove a patriot into exile. when do you sail, captain horster?

horster. hm!—that was just what i had come to speak about—

dr. stockmann. why, has anything gone wrong with the ship?

horster. no; but what has happened is that i am not to sail in it.

petra. do you mean that you have been dismissed from your command?

horster (smiling). yes, that's just it.

petra. you too.

mrs. stockmann. there, you see, thomas!

dr. stockmann. and that for the truth's sake! oh, if i had thought such a thing possible—

horster. you mustn't take it to heart; i shal

dr. stockmann. aha! (calls out.) come in!

mrs. stockmann. dear thomas, promise me definitely—. (peter stockmann comes in from the hall.)

peter stockmann. oh, you are engaged. in that case, i will—

dr. stockmann. no, no, come in.

peter stockmann. but i wanted to speak to you alone.

mrs. stockmann. we will go into the sitting-room in the meanwhile.

horster. and i will look in again later.

dr. stockmann. no, go in there with them, captain horster; i want to hear more about—.

horster. very well, i will wait, then. (he follows mrs. stockmann and petra into the sitting-room.)

dr. stockmann. i daresay you find it rather draughty here today. put your hat on.

peter stockmann. thank you, if i may. (does so.) i think i caught cold last night; i stood and shivered—

dr. stockmann. really? i found it warm enough.

peter stockmann. i regret that it was not in my power to prevent those excesses last night.

(mrs. stockmann, petra and horster come in from the sitting-room.)

mrs. stockmann. good gracious, thomas! what is happening?

dr. stockmann (brandishing the umbrella). jump out, i tell you! out into the gutter!

hovstad. an assault on an unoffending man! i call you to witness, captain horster. (hurries out through the hall.)

aslaksen (irresolutely). if only i knew the way about here—. (steals out through the sitting-room.)

mrs. stockmann (holding her husband back). control yourself, thomas!

dr. stockmann (throwing down the umbrella). upon my soul, they have escaped after all.

mrs. stockmann. what did they want you to do?

dr. stockmann. i will tell you later on; i have something else to think about now. (goes to the table and writes something on a calling-card.) look there, ka

petra. stay here?

mrs. stockmann. here, in the town?

dr. stockmann. yes, here. this is the field of battle—this is where the fight will be. this is where i shall triumph! as soon as i have had my trousers sewn up i shall go out and look for another house. we must have a roof over our heads for the winter.

horster. that you shall have in my house.

dr. stockmann. can i?

horsier. yes, quite well. i have plenty of room, and i am almost never at home.

mrs. stockmann. how good of you, captain horster!

petra. thank you!

dr. stockmann (grasping his hand). thank you, thank you! that is one trouble over! now i can set to work in earnest at once. there is an endless amount of things to look through here, katherine! luckily i shall have all my time at my disposal; because i have been dismissed from the baths, you know.

mrs. stockmann (with a sigh). oh yes, i expected that.

dr. stockmann. and they want to take my practice away from me too. let them! i have got the poor people to fall back upon

be beaten off the field by public opinion and the compact majority and all that devilry? no, thank you! and what i want to do is so simple and clear and straightforward. i only want to drum into the heads of these curs the fact that the liberals are the most insidious enemies of freedom—that party programmes strangle every young and vigorous truth—that considerations of expediency turn morality and justice upside down—and that they will end by making life here unbearable. don't you think, captain horster, that i ought to be able to make people understand that?

horster. very likely; i don't know much about such things myself.

dr. stockmann. well, look here—i will explain! it is the party leaders that must be exterminated. a party leader is like a wolf, you see—like a voracious wolf. he requires a certain number of smaller victims to prey upon every year, if he is to live. just look at hovstad and aslaksen! how many smaller victims have they not put an end to—or at any rate maimed and man
