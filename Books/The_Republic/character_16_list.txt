Lover of sights and sounds - 
 "Lovers of sights and sounds" is Socrates's term
for the pseudo-intellectuals who claim to have expertise regarding
all that is beautiful, but who fail to recognize that there is such
a thing as the Form of the Beautiful, which causes all beauty in
the visible realm. Socrates is adamant that lovers of sights and
sounds be distinguished from philosophers, who grasp the Forms,
and thus have knowledge. Lovers of sights and sounds have no knowledge,
only opinion.
