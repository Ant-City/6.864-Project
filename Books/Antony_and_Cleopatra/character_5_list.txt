Pompey - 
                	The
son of a great general who was one of Julius Caesar's partners in
power. Pompey is young and popular with the Roman people, and he
possesses enough military might to stand as a legitimate threat
to the triumvirs. He fancies himself honorable for refusing to allow
one of his men to kill the unsuspecting Caesar, Antony, and Lepidus
when they are his guests.
