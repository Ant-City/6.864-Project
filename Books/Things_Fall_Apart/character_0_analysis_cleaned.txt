[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER], the son of the effeminate and lazy unoka, strives
to make his way in a world that seems to value manliness. in so
doing, he rejects everything for which he believes his father stood.
unoka was idle, poor, profligate, cowardly, gentle, and interested
in music and conversation. [CHARACTER] consciously adopts opposite ideals and
becomes productive, wealthy, thrifty, brave, violent, and adamantly
opposed to music and anything else that he perceives to be "soft,"
such as conversation and emotion. he is stoic to a fault.

[CHARACTER] achieves great social and financial success by
embracing these ideals. he marries three women and fathers several
children. nevertheless, just as his father was at odds with the
values of the community around him, so too does [CHARACTER] find himself
unable to adapt to changing times as the white man comes to live
among the umuofians. as it becomes evident that compliance rather
than violence constitutes the wisest principle for survival, [CHARACTER]
realizes that he has become a relic, no longer able to function
within his changing society.
[CHARACTER] is a tragic hero in the classical sense: although
he is a superior character, his tragic flaw--the equation of manliness
with rashness, anger, and violence--brings about his own destruction. [CHARACTER]
is gruff, at times, and usually unable to express his feelings (the
narrator frequently uses the word "inwardly" in reference to [CHARACTER]'s
emotions). but his emotions are indeed quite complex, as his "manly"
values conflict with his "unmanly" ones, such as fondness for ikemefuna
and ezinma. the narrator privileges us with information that [CHARACTER]'s
fellow clan members do not have--that [CHARACTER] surreptitiously follows
ekwefi into the forest in pursuit of ezinma, for example--and thus
allows us to see the tender, worried father beneath the seemingly
indifferent exterior.
