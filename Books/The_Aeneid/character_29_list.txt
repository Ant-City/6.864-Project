Ulysses - 
                    The
hero of Homer's Odyssey, and one of the captains of
the Greek army that takes Troy. Ulysses (Odysseus in Greek lore),
like Aeneas, must make a long and treacherous voyage before he finds
home again, and references to his whereabouts in the Aeneid help
situate Aeneas's wanderings in relation to Ulysses'.
