miss[CHARACTER]
miss[CHARACTER] is the lone member of the newest generation
of the compson family. many parallels arise between miss[CHARACTER]
and her mother, caddy, but the two differ in important ways. miss[CHARACTER]
repeats caddy's early sexual awakening and promiscuity, but, unlike
caddy, she does not feel guilty about her actions. likewise, miss
quentin grows up in a meaner, more confined world than caddy does,
and is constantly subject to jason's domineering and cruelty. not
surprisingly, we see that miss[CHARACTER] is not nearly as loving or
compassionate as her mother. she is also more worldly and headstrong
than caddy. yet miss[CHARACTER]'s eventual success in recovering her
stolen money and escaping the family implies that her worldliness
and lack of compunction--very modern values--indeed work to her benefit.
