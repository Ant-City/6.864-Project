ent.  they were blooming young women, and, except one, rather
older than herself.  by bedtime tess was thoroughly tired, and fell
asleep immediately.

but one of the girls, who occupied an adjoining bed, was more wakeful
than tess, and would insist upon relating to the latter various
particulars of the homestead into which she had just entered.  the
girl's whispered words mingled with the shades, and, to tess's drowsy
mind, they seemed to be generated by the darkness in which they
floated.

"mr angel clare--he that is learning milking, and that plays
the harp--never says much to us.  he is a pa'son's son, and is
too much taken up wi' his own thoughts to notice girls.  he is
the dairyman's pupil--learning farming in all its branches.  he
has learnt sheep-farming at another place, and he's now mastering
dairy-work....  yes, he is quite the gentleman-born.  his father is
the reverent mr clare at emminster--a good many miles from here."

"oh--i have heard of him," said her companion, now awake.  "a v

what they call high.  all his sons, except our mr clare, be made

tess had not at this hour the curiosity to ask why the present mr
clare was not made a parson like his brethren, and gradually fell
asleep again, the words of her informant coming to her along with the
smell of the cheeses in the adjoining cheeseloft, and the measured
dripping of the whey from the wrings downstairs.

angel clare rises out of the past not altogether as a distinct
figure, but as an appreciative voice, a long regard of fixed,
abstracted eyes, and a mobility of mouth somewhat too small and
delicately lined for a man's, though with an unexpectedly firm close
of the lower lip now and then; enough to do away with any inference
of indecision.  nevertheless, something nebulous, preoccupied, vague,
in his bearing and regard, marked him as one who probably had no very
definite aim or concern about his material fu

directed to the reverend james clare.  the vicar having opened it and
found it to contain a book, read a few pages; whereupon he jumped up
from his seat and went straight to the shop with the book under his
arm.

"why has this been sent to my house?" he asked peremptorily, holding
up the volume.

"it was ordered, sir."

"not by me, or any one belonging to me, i am happy to say."

the shopkeeper looked into his order-book.

"oh, it has been misdirected, sir," he said.  "it was ordered by mr
angel clare, and should have been sent to him."

mr clare winced as if he had been struck.  he went home pale and
dejected, and called angel into his study.

"look into this book, my boy," he said.  "what do you know about it?"

"i ordered it," said angel simply.

"what for?"

"to read."

"how can you think of reading it?"

"how can i?  why--it is a system of philosophy.  there is no more
moral, or even religious, work published."

"yes--moral enough; i don't deny that.  but religious!--and for you,

years; and having an acquaintance who was starting on a thriving life
as a colonial farmer, it occurred to angel that this might be a lead
in the right direction.  farming, either in the colonies, america, or
at home--farming, at any rate, after becoming well qualified for the
business by a careful apprenticeship--that was a vocation which would
probably afford an independence without the sacrifice of what he
valued even more than a competency--intellectual liberty.

so we find angel clare at six-and-twenty here at talbothays as a
student of kine, and, as there were no houses near at hand in which
he could get a comfortable lodging, a boarder at the dairyman's.

his room was an immense attic which ran the whole length of the
dairy-house.  it could only be reached by a ladder from the
cheese-loft, and had been closed up for a long time till he arrived
and selected it as his retreat.  here clare had plenty of space, and
could often be heard by the dairy-folk pacing up and down when

humanity.  secondarily, he made close acquaintance with phenomena
which he had before known but darkly--the seasons in their moods,
morning and evening, night and noon, winds in their different
tempers, trees, waters and mists, shades and silences, and the voices
of inanimate things.


the early mornings were still sufficiently cool to render a fire
acceptable in the large room wherein they breakfasted; and, by
mrs crick's orders, who held that he was too genteel to mess at
their table, it was angel clare's custom to sit in the yawning
chimney-corner during the meal, his cup-and-saucer and plate being
placed on a hinged flap at his elbow.  the light from the long, wide,
mullioned window opposite shone in upon his nook, and, assisted by a
secondary light of cold blue quality which shone down the chimney,
enabled him to read there easily whenever disposed to do so.  between
clare and the window was the table at which his companions sat, their
munching profiles rising sharp against the panes; while

thus, neither having the clue to the other's secret, they were
respectively puzzled at what each revealed, and awaited new knowledge
of each other's character and mood without attempting to pry into
each other's history.


every day, every hour, brought to him one more little stroke of
her nature, and to her one more of his.  tess was trying to lead a
repressed life, but she little divined the strength of her own
vitality.

at first tess seemed to regard angel clare as an intelligence rather
than as a man.  as such she compared him with herself; and at every
discovery of the abundance of his illuminations, of the distance
between her own modest mental standpoint and the unmeasurable, andean
altitude of his, she became quite dejected, disheartened from all
further effort on her own part whatever.

he observed her dejection one day, when he had casually mentioned
something to her about pastoral life in ancient greece.  she was
gathering the buds called "lord

sapling which had rooted down to a poisonous stratum on the spot of
its sowing had been transplanted to a deeper soil.  moreover she, and
clare also, stood as yet on the debatable land between predilection
and love; where no profundities have been reached; no reflections
have set in, awkwardly inquiring, "whither does this new current tend
to carry me?  what does it mean to my future?  how does it stand
towards my past?"

tess was the merest stray phenomenon to angel clare as yet--a rosy,
warming apparition which had only just acquired the attribute of
persistence in his consciousness.  so he allowed his mind to be
occupied with her, deeming his preoccupation to be no more than a
philosopher's regard of an exceedingly novel, fresh, and interesting
specimen of womankind.

 one from another in natures and moods so greatly as they
did, they yet formed, bending, a curiously uniform row--automatic,
noiseless; and an alien observer passing down the neighbouring lane
might well have been excused for massing them as "hodge".  as they
crept along, stooping low to discern the plant, a soft yellow gleam
was reflected from the buttercups into their shaded faces, giving
them an elfish, moonlit aspect, though the sun was pouring upon their
backs in all the strength of noon.

angel clare, who communistically stuck to his rule of taking part
with the rest in everything, glanced up now and then.  it was not,
of course, by accident that he walked next to tess.

"well, how are you?" he murmured.

"very well, thank you, sir," she replied demurely.

as they had been discussing a score of personal matters only
half-an-hour before, the introductory style seemed a little
superfluous.  but they got no further in speech just then.  they

y, "marry one of them, if you really do want a dairywoman and
not a lady; and don't think of marrying me!"  she followed dairyman
crick, and had the mournful satisfaction of seeing that clare
remained behind.

from this day she forced herself to take pains to avoid him--never
allowing herself, as formerly, to remain long in his company, even if
their juxtaposition were purely accidental.  she gave the other three
every chance.

tess was woman enough to realize from their avowals to herself that
angel clare had the honour of all the dairymaids in his keeping, and
her perception of his care to avoid compromising the happiness of
either in the least degree bred a tender respect in tess for what she
deemed, rightly or wrongly, the self-controlling sense of duty shown
by him, a quality which she had never expected to find in one of the
opposite sex, and in the absence of which more than one of the simple
hearts who were his house-mates might have gone weeping on her
pilgrimage.

"we can't get there anyhow, without walking right through it, or else
going round the turnpike way; and that would make us so very late!"
said retty, pausing hopelessly.

"and i do colour up so hot, walking into church late, and all the
people staring round," said marian, "that i hardly cool down again
till we get into the that-it-may-please-thees."

while they stood clinging to the bank they heard a splashing round
the bend of the road, and presently appeared angel clare, advancing
along the lane towards them through the water.

four hearts gave a big throb simultaneously.

his aspect was probably as un-sabbatarian a one as a dogmatic
parson's son often presented; his attire being his dairy clothes,
long wading boots, a cabbage-leaf inside his hat to keep his head
cool, with a thistle-spud to finish him off.  "he's not going to

"no--i wish he was!" murmured tess.

"here he comes," she murmured, and they could hear that her lips were
dry with emotion.  "and i have to put my arms round his neck and look
into his face as marian did."

"there's nothing in that," said tess quickly.

"there's a time for everything," continued izz, unheeding.  "a time
to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; the first is now
going to be mine."

"fie--it is scripture, izz!"

"yes," said izz, "i've always a' ear at church for pretty verses."

angel clare, to whom three-quarters of this performance was a
commonplace act of kindness, now approached izz.  she quietly and
dreamily lowered herself into his arms, and angel methodically
marched off with her.  when he was heard returning for the third time
retty's throbbing heart could be almost seen to shake her.  he went
up to the red-haired girl, and while he was seizing her he glanced at
tess.  his lips could not have pronounced more plainly, "it will soon
be you and i."  her comprehension appeared

the gaiety with which they had set out had somehow vanished; and
yet there was no enmity or malice between them.  they were generous
young souls; they had been reared in the lonely country nooks where
fatalism is a strong sentiment, and they did not blame her.  such
supplanting was to be.

tess's heart ached.  there was no concealing from herself the fact
that she loved angel clare, perhaps all the more passionately from
knowing that the others had also lost their hearts to him.  there is
contagion in this sentiment, especially among women.  and yet that
same hungry nature had fought against this, but too feebly, and the
natural result had followed.

"i will never stand in your way, nor in the way of either of you!"
she declared to retty that night in the bedroom (her tears running
down).  "i can't help this, my dear!  i don't think marrying is in

ving in the cows.  during the day the animals obsequiously
followed the shadow of the smallest tree as it moved round the stem
with the diurnal roll; and when the milkers came they could hardly
stand still for the flies.

on one of these afternoons four or five unmilked cows chanced to
stand apart from the general herd, behind the corner of a hedge,
among them being dumpling and old pretty, who loved tess's hands
above those of any other maid.  when she rose from her stool under a
finished cow, angel clare, who had been observing her for some time,
asked her if she would take the aforesaid creatures next.  she
silently assented, and with her stool at arm's length, and the pail
against her knee, went round to where they stood.  soon the sound of
old pretty's milk fizzing into the pail came through the hedge, and
then angel felt inclined to go round the corner also, to finish off a
hard-yielding milcher who had strayed there, he being now as capable
of this as the dairyman himself.

"well, i can't mind the exact day without looking at my
memorandum-book," replied crick, with the same intolerable unconcern.

four months or so of torturing ecstasy in his society--of "pleasure
girdled about with pain".  after that the blackness of unutterable
night.


at this moment of the morning angel clare was riding along a narrow
lane ten miles distant from the breakfasters, in the direction of
his father's vicarage at emminster, carrying, as well as he could,
a little basket which contained some black-puddings and a bottle of
mead, sent by mrs crick, with her kind respects, to his parents.  the
white lane stretched before him, and his eyes were upon it; but they
were staring into next year, and not at the lane.  he loved her;
ought he to marry her?  dared he to marry her?  what would his mothe

latterly he had seen only life, felt only the great passionate pulse
of existence, unwarped, uncontorted, untrammelled by those creeds
which futilely attempt to check what wisdom would be content to
regulate.

on their part they saw a great difference in him, a growing
divergence from the angel clare of former times.  it was chiefly a
difference in his manner that they noticed just now, particularly
his brothers.  he was getting to behave like a farmer; he flung his
legs about; the muscles of his face had grown more expressive; his
eyes looked as much information as his tongue spoke, and more.  the
manner of the scholar had nearly disappeared; still more the manner
of the drawing-room young man.  a prig would have said that he had
lost culture, and a prude that he had become coarse.  such w

ady.

"well," said the dairyman, "'tis that slack-twisted 'hore's-bird of a
feller, jack dollop.  he's lately got married to a widow-woman."

"not jack dollop?  a villain--to think o' that!" said a milker.

the name entered quickly into tess durbeyfield's consciousness, for
it was the name of the lover who had wronged his sweetheart, and had
afterwards been so roughly used by the young woman's mother in the
butter-churn.

"and had he married the valiant matron's daughter, as he promised?"
asked angel clare absently, as he turned over the newspaper he was
reading at the little table to which he was always banished by mrs
crick, in her sense of his gentility.

"not he, sir.  never meant to," replied the dairyman. "as i say, 'tis
a widow-woman, and she had money, it seems--fifty poun' a year or so;
and that was all he was after.  they were married in a great hurry;
and then she told him that by marrying she had lost her fifty poun'

wearing a crown.  the compassion of his love for her, as she saw it,
made her lift up her heart to him in devotion.  he would sometimes
catch her large, worshipful eyes, that had no bottom to them looking
at him from their depths, as if she saw something immortal before
her.

she dismissed the past--trod upon it and put it out, as one treads on
a coal that is smouldering and dangerous.

she had not known that men could be so disinterested, chivalrous,
protective, in their love for women as he.  angel clare was far from
all that she thought him in this respect; absurdly far, indeed;
but he was, in truth, more spiritual than animal; he had himself
well in hand, and was singularly free from grossness.  though not
cold-natured, he was rather bright than hot--less byronic than
shelleyan; could love desperately, but with a love more especially
inclined to the imaginative and ethereal; it was a fastidious emotion
which could jealously guard the loved one against his very self.

when they were all in bed, and the light was out, marian whispered
across to her--

"you will think of us when you be his wife, tess, and of how we told
'ee that we loved him, and how we tried not to hate you, and did not
hate you, and could not hate you, because you were his choice, and
we never hoped to be chose by him."

they were not aware that, at these words, salt, stinging tears
trickled down upon tess's pillow anew, and how she resolved, with a
bursting heart, to tell all her history to angel clare, despite her
mother's command--to let him for whom she lived and breathed despise
her if he would, and her mother regard her as a fool, rather then
preserve a silence which might be deemed a treachery to him, and
which somehow seemed a wrong to these.

this penitential mood kept her from naming the wedding-day. the
beginning of november found its date still in abeyance, though he
asked her at the most tempting times.  but tess's desire seemed to be

"what?"

"i feel the red rising up at her having been caught!  but why should
i trifle so!  we will not trifle--life is too serious."

"it is.  perhaps i saw that before you did."

she was seeing it then.  to decline to marry him after all--in
obedience to her emotion of last night--and leave the dairy, meant
to go to some strange place, not a dairy; for milkmaids were not in
request now calving-time was coming on; to go to some arable farm
where no divine being like angel clare was.  she hated the thought,
and she hated more the thought of going home.

"so that, seriously, dearest tess," he continued, "since you will
probably have to leave at christmas, it is in every way desirable and
convenient that i should carry you off then as my property.  besides,
if you were not the most uncalculating girl in the world you would
know that we could not go on like this for ever."

"i wish we could.  that it would always be summer and autumn, and you

the frame of mind.

but she wrote anew to her mother, ostensibly to notify the
wedding-day; really to again implore her advice.  it was a gentleman
who had chosen her, which perhaps her mother had not sufficiently
considered.  a post-nuptial explanation, which might be accepted with
a light heart by a rougher man, might not be received with the same
feeling by him.  but this communication brought no reply from mrs
durbeyfield.

despite angel clare's plausible representation to himself and to tess
of the practical need for their immediate marriage, there was in
truth an element of precipitancy in the step, as became apparent at a
later date.  he loved her dearly, though perhaps rather ideally and
fancifully than with the impassioned thoroughness of her feeling for
him.  he had entertained no notion, when doomed as he had thought to
an unintellectual bucolic life, that such charms as he beheld in this
idyllic creature would be found behind

another day--it is rather gloomy.  evidently some dim knowledge of
it has been brought back to your mind by the sight of this venerable
caravan."

"i don't remember hearing it before," she murmured.  "is it when we
are going to die, angel, that members of my family see it, or is it
when we have committed a crime?"

"now, tess!"

he silenced her by a kiss.

by the time they reached home she was contrite and spiritless.  she
was mrs angel clare, indeed, but had she any moral right to the name?
was she not more truly mrs alexander d'urberville?  could intensity
of love justify what might be considered in upright souls as culpable
reticence?  she knew not what was expected of women in such cases;
and she had no counsellor.

however, when she found herself alone in her room for a few
minutes--the last day this on which she was ever to enter it--she
knelt down and prayed.  she tried to pray to god, but it was her
husband who really had he

"how vexing!" said tess.

the packet had been brought by a special messenger, who had arrived
at talbothays from emminster vicarage immediately after the departure
of the married couple, and had followed them hither, being under
injunction to deliver it into nobody's hands but theirs.  clare
brought it to the light.  it was less than a foot long, sewed up in
canvas, sealed in red wax with his father's seal, and directed in his
father's hand to "mrs angel clare."

"it is a little wedding-present for you, tess," said he, handing it
to her.  "how thoughtful they are!"

tess looked a little flustered as she took it.

"i think i would rather have you open it, dearest," said she, turning
over the parcel.  "i don't like to break those great seals; they look
so serious.  please open it for me!"

he undid the parcel.  inside was a case of morocco leather, on the
top of which lay a note and a key.

the note was for clare, in the following words:

well, i don't want to be anything more."

"you may think so, tess!  you are.  what do you mean?"

"i don't know," she said hastily, with tears in her accents.  "i
thought i--because i am not respectable, i mean.  i told you i
thought i was not respectable enough long ago--and on that account
i didn't want to marry you, only--only you urged me!"

she broke into sobs, and turned her back to him.  it would almost
have won round any man but angel clare.  within the remote depths of
his constitution, so gentle and affectionate as he was in general,
there lay hidden a hard logical deposit, like a vein of metal in a
soft loam, which turned the edge of everything that attempted to
traverse it.  it had blocked his acceptance of the church; it blocked
his acceptance of tess.  moreover, his affection itself was less fire
than radiance, and, with regard to the other sex, when he ceased
to believe he ceased to follow: contrasting in this with many

her craving for the lustre of her true position as his wife, and to
hide from her parents the vast extent of the division between them,
she made use of this letter as her reason for again departing,
leaving them under the impression that she was setting out to join
him.  still further to screen her husband from any imputation of
unkindness to her, she took twenty-five of the fifty pounds clare
had given her, and handed the sum over to her mother, as if the wife
of a man like angel clare could well afford it, saying that it was a
slight return for the trouble and humiliation she had brought upon
them in years past.  with this assertion of her dignity she bade them
farewell; and after that there were lively doings in the durbeyfield
household for some time on the strength of tess's bounty, her mother
saying, and, indeed, believing, that the rupture which had arisen
between the young husband and wife had adjusted itself under their
strong feeling that they could not live apart fr

tion in which he was obliged to
practise deception on his parents.  he almost talked to her in his
anger, as if she had been in the room.  and then her cooing voice,
plaintive in expostulation, disturbed the darkness, the velvet touch
of her lips passed over his brow, and he could distinguish in the air
the warmth of her breath.

this night the woman of his belittling deprecations was thinking how
great and good her husband was.  but over them both there hung a
deeper shade than the shade which angel clare perceived, namely, the
shade of his own limitations.  with all his attempted independence of
judgement this advanced and well-meaning young man, a sample product
of the last five-and-twenty years, was yet the slave to custom and
conventionality when surprised back into his early teachings.  no
prophet had told him, and he was not prophet enough to tell himself,
that essentially this young wife of his was as deserving of the
praise of king lemuel as any other woman endowed with the same

 in others wrought beatific smiles upon her--an
enviable result, although, in the opinion of angel, it was obtained
by a curiously unnatural sacrifice of humanity to mysticism.

she had learnt that he was about to leave england, and observed what
an excellent and promising scheme it seemed to be.

"yes; it is a likely scheme enough in a commercial sense, no doubt,"
he replied.  "but, my dear mercy, it snaps the continuity of
existence.  perhaps a cloister would be preferable."

"a cloister!  o, angel clare!"

"well?"

"why, you wicked man, a cloister implies a monk, and a monk roman
catholicism."

"and roman catholicism sin, and sin damnation.  thou art in a parlous
state, angel clare."

"_i_ glory in my protestantism!" she said severely.

then clare, thrown by sheer misery into one of the demoniacal moods
in which a man does despite to his true principles, called her close
to him, and fiendishly whispered in her ear the most heterodox ideas
he could think of.  his momentary laughter at the horro

he drove on; but no sooner had izz turned into the lane, and clare
was out of sight, than she flung herself down on the bank in a fit of
racking anguish; and it was with a strained unnatural face that she
entered her mother's cottage late that night.  nobody ever was told
how izz spent the dark hours that intervened between angel clare's
parting from her and her arrival home.

clare, too, after bidding the girl farewell, was wrought to aching
thoughts and quivering lips.  but his sorrow was not for izz.  that
evening he was within a feather-weight's turn of abandoning his road
to the nearest station, and driving across that elevated dorsal line
of south wessex which divided him from his tess's home.  it was
neither a contempt for her nature, nor the probable state of her
heart, which deterred him.

sojourn.  there seemed to be no help for it; hither she was doomed to
come.  the stubborn soil around her showed plainly enough that the
kind of labour in demand here was of the roughest kind; but it was
time to rest from searching, and she resolved to stay, particularly
as it began to rain.  at the entrance to the village was a cottage
whose gable jutted into the road, and before applying for a lodging
she stood under its shelter, and watched the evening close in.

"who would think i was mrs angel clare!" she said.

the wall felt warm to her back and shoulders, and she found that
immediately within the gable was the cottage fireplace, the heat of
which came through the bricks.  she warmed her hands upon them, and
also put her cheek--red and moist with the drizzle--against their
comforting surface.  the wall seemed to be the only friend she had.
she had so little wish to leave it that she could have stayed there
all night.

tossed off the last half-pint in their flagon, put down their hooks,
tied their last sheaves, and went away.  marian and izz would have
done likewise, but on hearing that tess meant to stay, to make up
by longer hours for her lack of skill, they would not leave her.
looking out at the snow, which still fell, marian exclaimed, "now,
we've got it all to ourselves."  and so at last the conversation
turned to their old experiences at the dairy; and, of course, the
incidents of their affection for angel clare.

"izz and marian," said mrs angel clare, with a dignity which was
extremely touching, seeing how very little of a wife she was: "i
can't join in talk with you now, as i used to do, about mr clare; you
will see that i cannot; because, although he is gone away from me for
the present, he is my husband."

izz was by nature the sauciest and most caustic of all the four girls
who had loved clare.  "he was a very splendid lover, no doubt," she
said; "but i don't think he is a too fond husband to go

e about it," he said uneasily.

"i believe in the spirit of the sermon on the mount, and so did my
dear husband...  but i don't believe--"

here she gave her negations.

"the fact is," said d'urberville drily, "whatever your dear husband
believed you accept, and whatever he rejected you reject, without the
least inquiry or reasoning on your own part.  that's just like you
women.  your mind is enslaved to his."

"ah, because he knew everything!" said she, with a triumphant
simplicity of faith in angel clare that the most perfect man could
hardly have deserved, much less her husband.

"yes, but you should not take negative opinions wholesale from
another person like that.  a pretty fellow he must be to teach you
such scepticism!"

"he never forced my judgement!  he would never argue on the subject
with me!  but i looked at it in this way; what he believed, after
inquiring deep into doctrines, was much more likely to be right than
what i might believe, who hadn't looked into doctrines at all."

he clenched his lips, mortified with himself for his weakness.  his
eyes were equally barren of worldly and religious faith.  the corpses
of those old fitful passions which had lain inanimate amid the lines
of his face ever since his reformation seemed to wake and come
together as in a resurrection.  he went out indeterminately.

though d'urberville had declared that this breach of his engagement
to-day was the simple backsliding of a believer, tess's words, as
echoed from angel clare, had made a deep impression upon him, and
continued to do so after he had left her.  he moved on in silence, as
if his energies were benumbed by the hitherto undreamt-of possibility
that his position was untenable.  reason had had nothing to do with
his whimsical conversion, which was perhaps the mere freak of a
careless man in search of a new sensation, and temporarily impressed
by his mother's death.

the drops of logic tess had let fall into the sea of his enthusiasm

she tried to argue, and tell him that he had mixed in his dull
brain two matters, theology and morals, which in the primitive days
of mankind had been quite distinct.  but owing to angel clare's
reticence, to her absolute want of training, and to her being a
vessel of emotions rather than reasons, she could not get on.

"well, never mind," he resumed.  "here i am, my love, as in the old
times!"

"not as then--never as then--'tis different!" she entreated.  "and
there was never warmth with me!  o why didn't you keep your faith,
if the loss of it has brought you to speak to me like this!"

"because you've knocked it out of me; so the evil be upon your sweet

ard but herself.  under the thatched roofs her mind's eye beheld
relaxed tendons and flaccid muscles, spread out in the darkness
beneath coverlets made of little purple patchwork squares, and
undergoing a bracing process at the hands of sleep for renewed labour
on the morrow, as soon as a hint of pink nebulosity appeared on
hambledon hill.

at three she turned the last corner of the maze of lanes she had
threaded, and entered marlott, passing the field in which as a
club-girl she had first seen angel clare, when he had not danced
with her; the sense of disappointment remained with her yet.  in the
direction of her mother's house she saw a light.  it came from the
bedroom window, and a branch waved in front of it and made it wink at
her.  as soon as she could discern the outline of the house--newly
thatched with her money--it had all its old effect upon tess's
imagination.  part of her body and life it ever seemed to be; the
slope of its dormers, the finish of its gables, the broken courses of

"if you ask for it.  but you won't, tess; i know you; you'll never
ask for it--you'll starve first!"

with these words he rode off.  just at the corner of the street he
met the man with the paint-pot, who asked him if he had deserted the
brethren.

"you go to the devil!" said d'urberville.

tess remained where she was a long while, till a sudden rebellious
sense of injustice caused the region of her eyes to swell with the
rush of hot tears thither.  her husband, angel clare himself, had,
like others, dealt out hard measure to her; surely he had!  she had
never before admitted such a thought; but he had surely!  never
in her life--she could swear it from the bottom of her soul--had
she ever intended to do wrong; yet these hard judgements had
come.  whatever her sins, they were not sins of intention, but of
inadvertence, and why should she have been punished so persistently?

she passionately seized the first piece of paper that came to hand,

when he was gone she bent down upon the entrance to the vaults, and

in the meantime marian and izz huett had journeyed onward with the
chattels of the ploughman in the direction of their land of canaan--
the egypt of some other family who had left it only that morning.
but the girls did not for a long time think of where they were going.
their talk was of angel clare and tess, and tess's persistent lover,
whose connection with her previous history they had partly heard and
partly guessed ere this.

"'tisn't as though she had never known him afore," said marian.  "his

   look to your wife if you do love her as much as she do

this was addressed to angel clare at the only place they had ever
heard him to be connected with, emminster vicarage; after which they
continued in a mood of emotional exaltation at their own generosity,
which made them sing in hysterical snatches and weep at the same
time.

burning under their green shades in the vicar's study, but he had not
been sitting there.  occasionally he came in, st

at eleven o'clock that night, having secured a bed at one of the
hotels and telegraphed his address to his father immediately on his
arrival, he walked out into the streets of sandbourne.  it was too
late to call on or inquire for any one, and he reluctantly postponed
his purpose till the morning.  but he could not retire to rest just
yet.

this fashionable watering-place, with its eastern and its western
stations, its piers, its groves of pines, its promenades, and its
covered gardens, was, to angel clare, like a fairy place suddenly
created by the stroke of a wand, and allowed to get a little dusty.
an outlying eastern tract of the enormous egdon waste was close at
hand, yet on the very verge of that tawny piece of antiquity such a
glittering novelty as this pleasure city had chosen to spring up.
within the space of a mile from its outskirts every irregularity
of the soil was prehistoric, every channel an undisturbed british
trackway; not a sod having been turned there since the days of the

mrs brooks, the lady who was the householder at the herons and owner
of all the handsome furniture, was not a person of an unusually
curious turn of mind. she was too deeply materialized, poor woman,
by her long and enforced bondage to that arithmetical demon
profit-and-loss, to retain much curiousity for its own sake, and
apart from possible lodgers' pockets.  nevertheless, the visit of
angel clare to her well-paying tenants, mr and mrs d'urberville, as
she deemed them, was sufficiently exceptional in point of time and
manner to reinvigorate the feminine proclivity which had been stifled
down as useless save in its bearings to the letting trade.

tess had spoken to her husband from the doorway, without entering
the dining-room, and mrs brooks, who stood within the partly-closed
door of her own sitting-room at the back of the passage, could
hear fragments of the conversation--if conversati

quiet resounded with the tramp of many footsteps, a surgeon among the
rest.  the wound was small, but the point of the blade had touched
the heart of the victim, who lay on his back, pale, fixed, dead, as
if he had scarcely moved after the infliction of the blow.  in a
quarter of an hour the news that a gentleman who was a temporary
visitor to the town had been stabbed in his bed, spread through every
street and villa of the popular watering-place.

meanwhile angel clare had walked automatically along the way by which
he had come, and, entering his hotel, sat down over the breakfast,
staring at nothingness.  he went on eating and drinking unconsciously
till on a sudden he demanded his bill; having paid which, he took his
dressing-bag in his hand, the only luggage he had brought with him,
and went out.

at the moment of his departure a telegram was handed to him--a few
words from his mother, stating that they were glad to know his
address, and informing him that

s were walking rapidly,
as if unconscious of the trying ascent--unconscious through
preoccupation and not through buoyancy.  they had emerged upon this
road through a narrow, barred wicket in a high wall a little lower
down.  they seemed anxious to get out of the sight of the houses and
of their kind, and this road appeared to offer the quickest means
of doing so.  though they were young, they walked with bowed heads,
which gait of grief the sun's rays smiled on pitilessly.

one of the pair was angel clare, the other a tall budding
creature--half girl, half woman--a spiritualized image of tess,
slighter than she, but with the same beautiful eyes--clare's
sister-in-law, 'liza-lu.  their pale faces seemed to have shrunk
to half their natural size.  they moved on hand in hand, and never
spoke a word, the drooping of their heads being that of giotto's
"two apostles".

when they had nearly reached the top of the great west hill the
clocks in the town struck eight.  each gave a start at the notes,
