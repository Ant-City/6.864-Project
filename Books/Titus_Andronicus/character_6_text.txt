  mar. my lord to step out of these sudden dumps,
how comes it that the subtile queene of gothes,
is of a sodaine thus aduanc'd in rome?
  ti. i know not marcus: but i know it is,
(whether by deuise or no) the heauens can tell,
is she not then beholding to the man,
that brought her for this high good turne so farre?
yes, and will nobly him remunerate.

and shall do with my life,
onely thus much i giue your grace to know,
by all the duties that i owe to rome,
this noble gentleman lord titus heere,
is in opinion and in honour wrong'd,
that in the rescue of lauinia,
with his owne hand did slay his youngest son,
in zeale to you, and highly mou'd to wrath.
to be controul'd in that he frankly gaue:
receiue him then to fauour saturnine,
that hath expre'st himselfe in all his deeds,
a father and a friend to thee, and rome

   tit. prince bassianus leaue to plead my deeds,
'tis thou, and those, that haue dishonoured me,
rome and the righteous heauens be my iudge,
how i haue lou'd and honour'd saturnine

   tam. my worthy lord if euer tamora,
were gracious in those princely eyes of thine,
then heare me speake indifferently for all:
and at my sute (sweet) pardon what is past

and basely put it vp without reuenge?

d old man, and cheere the heart,
that dies in tempest of thy angry frowne

   king. rise titus, rise,
my empresse hath preuail'd

   titus. i thanke your maiestie,
and her my lord.
these words, these lookes,
infuse new life in me

   tamo. titus, i am incorparate in rome,
a roman now adopted happily.
and must aduise the emperour for his good,
this day all quarrels die andronicus.
and let it be mine honour good my lord,
that i haue reconcil'd your friends and you.
for you prince bassianus, i haue past
my word and promise to the emperour,
that you will be more milde and tractable.
and feare not lords:
and you lauinia,
by my aduise all humbled on your knees,
you shall aske pardon of his maiestie

thrust these reprochfull speeches downe his throat,
that he hath breath'd in my dishonour heere

   chi. for that i am prepar'd, and full resolu'd,
foule spoken coward,
that thundrest with thy tongue,
and with thy weapon nothing dar'st performe

   aron. a way i say.
now by the gods that warlike gothes adore,
this pretty brabble will vndoo vs all:
why lords, and thinke you not how dangerous
it is to set vpon a princes right?
what is lauinia then become so loose,
or bassianus so degenerate,
that for her loue such quarrels may be broacht,
without controulement, iustice, or reuenge?
young lords beware, and should the empresse know,
this discord ground, the musicke would not please

   chi. i care not i, knew she and all the world,
i loue lauinia more then all the world

   demet. youngling,
learne thou to make some meaner choise,
lauinia is thine elder brothers hope

how furious and impatient they be,

i tell you lords, you doe but plot your deaths,
by this deuise

   chi. aaron, a thousand deaths would i propose,
to atchieue her whom i do loue

   aron. to atcheiue her, how?
  deme. why, mak'st thou it so strange?
shee is a woman, therefore may be woo'd,
shee is a woman, therfore may be wonne,
shee is lauinia therefore must be lou'd.
what man, more water glideth by the mill
then wots the miller of, and easie it is
of a cut loafe to steale a shiue we know:
though bassianus be the emperours brother,
better then he haue worne vulcans badge

   aron. i, and as good as saturninus may

   deme. then why should he dispaire that knowes to court it
with words, faire lookes, and liberality:
what hast not thou full often strucke a doe,
and borne her cleanly by the keepers nose?

would serue your turnes

   aron. for shame be friends, & ioyne for that you iar:
'tis pollicie, and stratageme must doe
that you affect, and so must you resolue,
that what you cannot as you would atcheiue,
you must perforce accomplish as you may:
take this of me, lucrece was not more chast
then this lauinia, bassianus loue,
a speedier course this lingring languishment

my lords, a solemne hunting is in hand.
there will the louely roman ladies troope:
the forrest walkes are wide and spacious,
and many vnfrequented plots there are,
fitted by kinde for rape and villanie:

and strike her home by force, if not by words:

our desires,
saturne is dominator ouer mine:
what signifies my deadly standing eye,
my silence, and my cloudy melancholie,
my fleece of woolly haire, that now vncurles,
euen as an adder when she doth vnrowle
to do some fatall execution?
no madam, these are no veneriall signes,
vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
blood, and reuenge, are hammering in my head.
harke tamora, the empresse of my soule,
which neuer hopes more heauen, then rests in thee,
this is the day of doome for bassianus;
his philomel must loose her tongue to day,
thy sonnes make pillage of her chastity,
and wash their hands in bassianus blood.
seest thou this letter, take it vp i pray thee,
and giue the king this fatall plotted scrowle,
now question me no more, we are espied,
heere comes a parcell of our hopefull booty,
which dreads not yet their liues destruction.

but fierce andronicus would not relent,
therefore away with her, and vse her as you will,
the worse to her, the better lou'd of me

be call'd a gentle queene,
and with thine owne hands kill me in this place,
for 'tis not life that i haue beg'd so long,
poore i was slaine, when bassianus dy'd

   tam. what beg'st thou then? fond woman let me go?
  laui. 'tis present death i beg, and one thing more,
that womanhood denies my tongue to tell:
oh keepe me from their worse then killing lust,
and tumble me into some loathsome pit,
where neuer mans eye may behold my body,
doe this, and be a charitable murderer

  mart. vpon his bloody finger he doth weare
a precious ring, that lightens all the hole:
which like a taper in some monument,
doth shine vpon the dead mans earthly cheekes,
and shewes the ragged intrailes of the pit:
so pale did shine the moone on piramus,
when he by night lay bath'd in maiden blood:

or wanting strength to doe thee so much good,
