kili and fili rushed for their bags and brought back little fiddles; dori, nori, and ori 
brought out flutes from somewhere inside their coats; bombur produced a drum from the 
hall; bifur and bofur went out too, and came back with clarinets that they had left among 
the walking-sticks dwalin and balin said: "excuse me, i left mine in the porch!" "just 
bring mine in with you," said thorin. they came back with viols as big as themselves, 
and with thorin's harp wrapped in a green cloth. it was a beautiful gold-en harp, and 
when thorin struck it the music began all at once, so sudden and sweet that 
bilbo forgot everything else, and was swept away into dark lands under strange moons, 
far over the water and very far from his hobbit-hole under the hill.

kings used to send for our smiths, and reward even the least skilful most richly. fathers

know, from men and elves and dwarves, wherever they can find them; and they guard 
their plunder as long as they live (which is practically forever, unless they are killed), and 
never enjoy a brass ring of it. indeed they hardly know a good bit of work from a bad, 
though they usually have a good notion of the current market value; and they can't make 
a thing for themselves, not even mend a little loose scale of their armour. there were 
lots of dragons in the north in those days, and gold was probably getting scarce up 
there, with the dwarves flying south or getting killed, and all the general waste and 
destruction that dragons make going from bad to worse. there was a most specially

doubt william had thought it very small and secret. it must have fallen out of his pocket, 
very luckily, before he was turned to stone. 
"why on earth didn't you mention it before?" they cried. 
gandalf grabbed it and fitted it into the key-hole. then the stone door swung back with 
one big push, and they all went inside. there were bones on the floor and a nasty smell 
was in the air; but there was a good deal of food jumbled carelessly on shelves and on 
the ground, among an untidy litter of plunder, of all sorts from brass buttons to pots full of 
gold coins standing in a corner. there were lots of clothes, too, hanging on the walls-too 
small for trolls, i am afraid they belonged to victims-and among them were several 
swords of various makes, shapes, and sizes. two caught their eyes particularly, 
because of their beautiful scabbards and jewelled hilts. gandalf and thorin each took 
one of these; and bilbo took a knife in a leather s

y of rivendell. the air grew warmer as 
they got lower, and the smell of the pine-trees made him drowsy, so that every now and 
again he nodded and nearly fell off, or bumped his nose on the pony's neck. 
their spirits rose as they went down and down. the trees changed to beech and oak, 
and hire was a comfortable feeling in the twilight. the last green had almost faded out of 
the grass, when they came at length to an open glade not far above the banks of the 
stream. 

"hrnmm! it smells like elves!" thought bilbo, and he looked up at the stars. they were 
burning bright and blue. just then there came a burst of song like laughter in the trees: 
 
"o! what are you doing, 
and where are you going? 
your ponies need shoeing! 
the river is flowing! 
o! tra-la-la-lally 
here down in the valley! 
o! what are you seeking, 
and where are you making?

so they laughed and sang in the trees; and pretty fair nonsense i daresay you think it. 
not that they would care they would only laugh all the more if you told them so. they 
were elves of course. soon bilbo caught glimpses of them as the darkness deepened. 
he loved elves, though he seldom met them; but he was a little frightened of them too. 
dwarves don't get on well with them. 
even decent enough dwarves like thorin and his friends think them foolish (which is a 
very foolish thing to think), or get annoyed with them. for some elves tease them and 
laugh at them, and most of all at their beards. 
"well, well!" said a voice. "just look! bilbo the hobbit on a pony, my dear!

then off they went into another song as ridiculous as the one i have written down in full. 
at last one, a tall young fellow, came out from the trees and bowed to gandalf and to 
thorin. 
"welcome to the valley!" he said. 

"thank you!" said thorin a bit gruffly; but gandalf was already off his horse and among 
the elves, talking merrily with them. 
"you are a little out of your way," said the elf: "that is, if you are making for the only path 
across the water and to the house beyond. we will set you right, but you had best get on 
foot, until you are over the bridge. are you going to stay a bit and sing with us, or will you 
go straight on? supper is preparing over there," he said. "i can smell the wood-fires for

also he would have liked to have a few private words with these people that seemed to 
know his name and all about him, although he had never been them before. he thought 
their opinion of his adventure might be interesting. elves know a lot and are wondrous 
folk for news, and know what is going on among the peoples of the land, as quick as 
water flows, or quicker. but the dwarves were all for supper as soon 'as possible just 
then, and would not stay. on they all went, leading their ponies, till they were brought to 
a good path and so at last to the very brink of the river. it was flowing fast and noisily, as 
mountain-streams do of a summer evening, when sun has been all day on the snow far 
up above. there was only

 a narrow bridge of stone without a parapet, as narrow as a 
pony could well walk on; and over that they had to go, slow and careful, one by one, 
each leading his pony by the bridle. the elves had brought bright lanterns to the shore, 
and they sang a merry song as the party went across. 
"don't dip your beard in the foam, father!" they cried to thorin, who was bent almost on 
to his hands and knees. "it is long enough without watering it." 
"mind bilbo doesn't eat all the cakes!" they called. "he is too fat to get through key-holes 
yet!" 
"hush, hush! good people! and good night!" said gandalf, who came last. 
"valleys have ears, and some elves have over merry tongues. good night!"

take a deal 
of telling anyway. they stayed long in that good house, fourteen days at least, and they 
found it hard to leave. bilbo would gladly have stopped there for ever and ever-even 
supposing a wish would have taken him right back to his hobbit-hole without trouble. yet 
there is little to tell about their stay. 
the master of the house was an elf-friend-one of those people whose fathers came into 
the strange stories before the beginning of history, the wars of the evil goblins and the 
elves and the first men in the north. in those days of our tale there were still some 
people who had both elves and heroes of the north for ancestors, and elrond the master 
of the house was their chief. he was as noble and as fair in face as an elf-lord, as strong 
as a warrior, as wise as a wizard, as venerable as a king of dwarves, and as kind as 
summer. he comes into. many tales, but his part in the story of bilbo's great adventure is 
only a small one, though important, as you will see, if we

hopes. their bags were filled with food and provisions light to carry but strong to bring 
them over the mountain passes. their plans were improved with the best advice. so the 

time came to mid- summer eve, and they were to go on again with the early sun on 
midsummer morning. 
elrond knew all about runes of every kind. that day he looked at the swords they had 
brought from the trolls' lair, and he said: "these are not troll-make. they are old swords, 
very old swords of the high elves of the west, my kin. they were made in gondolin for 
the goblin-wars. they must have come from a dragon's hoard or goblin plunder, for 
dragons and goblins destroyed that city many ages ago. this, thorin, the runes name 
orcrist, the goblin-cleaver in the ancient tongue of gondolin; it was a famous blade. 
this, gandalf, was glamdring, foe-hammer that the king of gondolin once wore. keep 
them well!" 
"whence did the trolls get them, i wonder?" said thorin looking at his 
sword with new interes

the last moon of autumn and the sun are in the sky together. but this will not help us 
much, i fear, for it passes our skill in these days to guess when such a time will come 
again." 
"that remains to be seen," said gandalf. "is there any more writing?" 
"none to be seen by this moon," said elrond, and he gave the map back to 

thorin; and then they went down to the water to see the elves dance and sing upon the 
midsummer's eve. 
the next morning was a midsummer's morning as fair and fresh as could be dreamed: 
blue sky and never a cloud, and the sun dancing on the water. now they rode away 
amid songs of farewell and good speed, with their hearts ready for more adventure, and 
with a knowledge of the road they must follow over the misty mountains to the land 
beyond.

 everybody knew they could not have been long about it; 
they had come back too quick. "it isn't all that big, and it does not go far back." 
that, of course, is the dangerous part about caves: you don't know how far they go back, 
sometimes, or where a passage behind may lead to, or what is waiting for you inside. 
but now fili and kill's news seemed good enough. so they all got up and prepared to 
move. the wind was howling and the thunder still growling, and they had a business 
getting themselves and their ponies along. still it was not very far to go, and before long 
they came to a big rock standing out into the path. if you stepped behind, you found a 
low arch in the side of the mountain. there was just room to get the ponies through with 
a squeeze, when they had been unpacked and unsaddled. as they passed under the 
arch, it was good to hear the wind and the rain outside instead of all about them, and to 
feel safe from the giants and their rocks. but the wizard was taking no risk

and being rummaged by goblins, and smelt by goblins, and fingered by goblins, and 
quarreled over by goblins. 
i am afraid that was the last they ever saw of those excellent little ponies, including a 
jolly sturdy little white fellow that elrond had lent to gandalf, since his horse was not 
suitable for the mountain-paths. for goblins eat horses and ponies and donkeys (and 
other much more dreadful things), and they are always hungry. just now however the 
prisoners were thinking only of themselves. the goblins chained their hands behind their 
backs and linked them all together in a line and dragged them to the far end of the 
cavern with little bilbo tugging at the end of the row. 
there in the shadows on a large flat stone sat a tremendous goblin with a huge head, 
and armed goblins were standing round him carrying the axes and the bent swords that 
they use. now goblins are cruel, wicked, and bad-hearted.

is called) so far. they did not hate dwarves especially, no more than 
they hated everybody and everything, and particularly the orderly and prosperous; in 
some parts wicked dwarves had even made alliances with them. but they had a special 
grudge against thorin's people, because of the war which you have heard mentioned, 
but which does not come into this tale; and anyway goblins don't care who they catch, as 
long as it is done smart and secret, and the prisoners are not able to defend 
themselves. 
"who are these miserable persons?" said the great goblin. 
"dwarves, and this!" said one of the drivers, pulling at bilbo's chain so that he fell 
forward onto his knees. 
"we found them sheltering in our front porch." 
"what do you mean by it?" said the great goblin turning to thorin. "up to no good, i'll

which thorin had worn, the sword which came from the trolls' lair. 
the great goblin gave a truly awful howl of rage when he looked at it, and all his 
soldiers gnashed their teeth, clashed their shields, and stamped. 
they knew the sword at once. it had killed hundreds of goblins in its time, when the fair 
elves of gondolin hunted them in the hills or did battle before their walls. they had called 
it orcrist, goblin-cleaver, but the goblins called it simply biter. they hated it and hated 
worse any one that carried it. 
"murderers' and elf-friends!" the great goblin shouted. "slash them! beat them! bite 
them! gnash them! take them away to dark holes full of snakes, and never let them see 
the light again!" he was in such a rage that he jumped off his seat and himself rushed at

goblin-hall growing fainter behind him. a pale light was leading them on. 
"quicker, quicker!" said the voice. "the torches will soon be relit." 
"half a minute!" said dori, who was at the back next to bilbo, and a decent fellow. he 
made the hobbit scramble on his shoulders as best he could with his tied hands, and 
then off they all went at a run, with a clink-clink of chains, and many a stumble, since 
they had no hands to steady themselves with. not for a long while did they stop, and by 
that time they must have been right down in the very mountain's heart. 
then gandalf lit up his wand. of course it was gandalf; but just then they were too busy 
to ask how he got there. he took out his sword again, and again it flashed in the dark by

blue flame for delight in the killing of the great lord of the cave. it made no trouble

on they went. gandalf was quite right: they began to hear goblin noises and horrible 
cries far behind in the passages they had come through. that sent them on faster than 
ever, and as poor bilbo could not possibly go half as fast-for dwarves can roll along at a 
tremendous pace, i can tell you, when they have to-they took it in turn to carry him on 
their backs. 
still goblins go faster than dwarves, and these goblins knew the way better (they had 
made the paths themselves), and were madly angry; so that do what they could the 
dwarves heard the cries and howls getting closer and closer. soon they could hear even 
the flap of the goblin feet, many many feet which seemed only just round the last corner. 
the blink of red torches could be seen behind them in the tunnel they were following; 
and they were getting deadly tired.

too, of nasty slimy things, with big bulging blind eyes, wriggling in the water. there are 
strange things living in the pools and lakes in the hearts of mountains: fish whose fathers 
swam in, goodness only knows how many years ago, and never swam out again, while 
their eyes grew bigger and bigger and bigger from trying to see in the blackness; also 
there are other things more slimy than fish. even in the tunnels and caves the goblins 
have made for themselves there are other things living unbeknown to them that have 
sneaked in from outside to lie up in the dark. some of these caves, too, go back in their 
beginnings to ages before the goblins, who only widened them and joined them up with 
passages, and the original owners are still there in odd comers, slinking and nosing

have got to' go back now into those abominable tunnels to look for him, then drat him, i

gandalf answered angrily: "i brought him, and i don't bring things that are of no use. 
either you help me to look for him, or i go and leave you here to get out of the mess as 
best you can yourselves. if we can only find him again, you will thank me before all is 
over. whatever did you want to go and drop him for, dori?" 
"you would have dropped him," said dori, "if a goblin had suddenly grabbed your leg 
from behind in the dark, tripped up your feet, and kicked you in the back!" 
"then why didn't you pick him up again?" 
"good heavens! can you ask! goblins fighting and biting in the dark, everybody falling

stomach felt all empty and loose and his legs all wobbly, now that the excitement was 
over. 
"can't help it," said gandalf, "unless you like to go back and ask the goblins nicely to let 
you have your pony back and your luggage." 
"no thank you!" said bilbo. 
"very well then, we must just tighten our belts and trudge on - or we shall be made into 
supper, and that will be much worse than having none ourselves." 
as they went on bilbo looked from side to side for something to eat; but the blackberries 
were still only in flower, and of course there were no nuts, nor even hawthorn-berries. he 
nibbled a bit of sorrel, and he drank from a small mountain-stream that crossed the path, 
and he ate three wild strawberries that he found on its bank, but it was not much good. 
they still went on and on. the rough path disappeared. the bushes, and the long

sage and the marjoram, and the yellow rockroses all vanished, and they found 
themselves at the top of a wide steep slope of fallen stones, the remains of a landslide. 
when they began to go down this, rubbish and small pebbles rolled away from their feet; 
soon larger bits of split stone went clattering down and started other pieces below them 
slithering and rolling; then lumps of rocks were disturbed and bounded off, crashing 
down with a dust and a noise. before long the whole slope above them and below them 
seemed on the move, and they were sliding away, huddled all together,

 in a fearful 
confusion of slipping, rattling, cracking slabs and stones. 

it was the trees at the bottom that saved them. they slid into the edge of a climbing 
wood of pines that here stood right up the mountain slope from the deeper darker forests 
of the valleys below. some caught hold of the trunks and swung themselves into lower 
branches, some (like the little hobbit) got behind a tree to shelter from the onslaught of 
the rocks. soon the danger was over, the slide had stopped, and the last faint crashes 
could be heard as the largest of the disturbed stones went bounding and spinning 
among the bracken and the pine-roots far below. 
"well! that has got us on a bit," said gandalf; "and even goblins tracking us will have a 
job to come down here quietly."

ves like men do on horses. now it 
seemed that a great goblin-raid had been planned for that very night. the wargs had 
come to meet the goblins and the goblins were late. the reason, no doubt, was the 
death of the great goblin, and all the excitement caused by the dwarves and bilbo and 
the wizard, for whom they were probably still hunting. 

in spite of the dangers of this far land bold men had of late been making their way back 
into it from the south, cutting down trees, and building themselves places to live in 
among the more pleasant woods in the valleys and along the river-shores. there were 
many of them, and they were brave and wellarmed, and even the wargs dared not 
attack them if there were many together, or in the bright day. but now they had planned 
with the goblins' help to come by night upon some of the villages nearest the mountains. 
if their plan had been carried out, there would have been none left there next day; all 
would have been killed except the few the goblin

down well on their journey across the plains below. 
the lord of the eagles would not take them anywhere near where men lived. 
"they would shoot at us with their great bows of yew," he said, "for they would think we 
were after their sheep. and at other times they would be right. 
no! we are glad to cheat the goblins of their sport, and glad to repay our thanks to you, 
but we will not risk ourselves for dwarves in the southward plains." 
"very well," said gandalf. "take us where and as far as you will! we are already deeply 
obliged to you. but in the meantime we are famished with hunger." 
"i am nearly dead of it," said bilbo in a weak little voice that nobody heard. 

"that can perhaps be mended," said the lord of the eagles. 
later on you might have seen a bright fire on the shelf of rock and the figures of the 
dwarves round it cooking and making a fine roasting smell. the eagles had

were coming out of the lands over west into these countries-it is a long tale." 
"then you had better come inside and tell me some of it, if it won't take all day," said the 
man leading the way through a dark door that opened out of the courtyard into the 
house. 
following him they found themselves in a wide hall with a fire-place in the middle. 
though it was summer there was a wood-fire burning and the smoke was rising to the 
blackened rafters in search of the way out through an opening in the roof. they passed 
through this dim hall, lit only by the fire and the hole above it, and came through another 
smaller door into a sort of veranda propped on wooden posts made of single tree-trunks.

"that's enough!" said beorn. "sit down and be quiet! now go on, gandalf!"

down into the west. but he could not resist the temptation to have the last word. before 
he had passed quite out of hearing he turned and put his hands to his mouth and called 
to them. they heard his voice come faintly: "good-bye! be good, take care of 
yourselves-and don't leave the path!" 
then he galloped away and was soon lost to sight. "o good-bye and go away!" grunted 
the dwarves, all the more angry because they were really filled with dismay at losing 
him. now began the most dangerous part of all the journey. 
they each shouldered the heavy pack and the water-skin which was their share, and 
turned from the light that lay on the lands outside and plunged into the forest.

much water, and in all the time they had 
seen neither spring nor stream. this was their state when one day they found their path 
blocked by a running water. it flowed fast and strong but not very wide right across the 
way, and it was black, or looked it in the gloom. it was well that beorn had warned them 
against it, or they would have drunk from it, whatever its colour, and filled some of their 
emptied skins at its bank. as it was they only thought of how to cross it without wetting 
themselves in its water. there had been a bridge of wood across, but it had rotted and 
fallen leaving only the broken posts near the bank. 
bilbo kneeling on the brink and peering forward cried: "there is a boat against the far 
bank! now why couldn't it have been this side!" 
"how far away do you think it is?" asked thorin, for by now they knew 
bilbo had the sharpest eyes among them. 
"not at all far. i shouldn't think above twelve yards." 
"twelve yards! i should have thought it was thirty at least, b

they were lost in a completely lightless dark and they could not even find one another, 
not for a long time at any rate. after blundering frantically in the gloom, falling over logs, 
bumping crash into trees, and shouting and calling till they must have waked everything 
in the forest for miles, at last they managed to gather themselves in a bundle and count 
themselves by touch. by that time they had, of course, quite forgotten in what direction 
the path lay, and they were all hopelessly lost, at least till morning. 
there was nothing for it but to settle down for the night where they were; they did not 
even dare to search on the ground for scraps of food for fear of becoming separated 
again. but they had not been lying long, and bilbo was only just getting drowsy, when

before he had time to slip on his ring, he stumbled forward into the full blaze of the fire 
and torches. it was no good. out went all the lights again and complete darkness fell. if it 
had been difficult collecting themselves before, it was far worse this time. and they 
simply could not find the hobbit. every time they counted themselves it only made 
thirteen. they shouted and called: "bilbo baggins! hobbit! you dratted hobbit! 
hi! hobbit, confusticate you, where are you?" and other things of that sort, but there was 
no answer. 
they were just giving up hope, when dori stumbled across him by sheer luck. in the dark

he felt a different person, and much fiercer and bolder in spite of an empty stomach, as 
he wiped his sword on the grass and put it back into its sheath. 
"i will give you a name," he said to it, "and i shall call you sting." 
after that he set out to explore. the forest was grim and silent, but obviously he had first 
of all to look for his friends, who were not likely to be very far off, unless they had been 
made prisoners by the elves (or worse things). 
bilbo felt that it was unsafe to shout, and he stood a long while wondering in what 
direction the path lay, and in what direction he should go first to look for the dwarves. "o! 
why did we not remember beorn's advice, and gandalf's!" he lamented. "what a mess 
we are in now! we! i only wish it was we: it is horrible being all alone." 
in the end he made as good a guess as he could at the direction from which the cries for 
help had come in the night - and by luck (he was b

thorin had been caught much faster than they had. you remember bilbo falling like a log 
into sleep, as he stepped into a circle of light? the next time it had been thorin who 
stepped forward, and as the lights went out he fell like a stone enchanted. all the noise 
of the dwarves lost in the night, their cries as the spiders caught them and bound them, 
and all the sounds of the battle next day, had passed over him unheard. then the wood-
elves had come to him, and bound him, and carried him away. the feasting people were 
woodelves, of course. these are not wicked folk. if they have a fault it is distrust of 
strangers. though their magic was strong, even in those days they were wary. they 
differed from the high elves of the west, and were more dangerous and less wise. for 
most of them (together with their scattered relations in the hills and mountains) were 
descended from the ancient tribes that never went to faerie in the west.

in the wide world the wood-elves lingered in the twilight of our sun and moon but loved

"i don't know, but i expect starving in the forest." 
"what were you doing in the forest?" 
"looking for food and drink, because we were starving." 
"but what brought you into the forest at all?" asked the king angrily. 
at that thorin shut his mouth and would not say another word. 
"very well!" said the king. "take him away and keep him safe, until he feels inclined to

then the elves put thongs on him, and shut him in one of the inmost caves with strong 
wooden doors, and left him. they gave him food and drink, plenty of both, if not very

ders bilbo and the dwarves made one last despairing 
effort to find a way out before they died of hunger and thirst. they got up and staggered 
on in the direction which eight out of the thirteen of them guessed to be the one in which 
the path lay; but they never found out if they were right. such day as there ever was in 
the forest was fading once more into the blackness of night, when suddenly out sprang 
the light of many torches all round them, like hundreds of red stars. out leaped wood-
elves with their bows and spears and called the dwarves to halt. 
there was no thought of a fight. even if the dwarves had not been in such a state that 
they were actually glad to be captured, their small knives, the only weapons they had, 

would have been of no use against the arrows of the elves that could hit a bird's eye in 
the dark. so they simply stopped dead and sat down and waited-all except bilbo, who 
popped on his ring and slipped quickly to one side.

each dwarf was blindfold, but that did not make much difference, for even bilbo with the 
use of his eyes could not see where they were going, and neither he nor the others knew 
where they had started from anyway. bilbo had all he could do to keep up with the 
torches, for the elves were making the dwarves go as fast as ever they could, sick and 
weary as they were. the king had ordered them to make haste. suddenly the torches 
stopped, and the hobbit had just time to catch them up before they began to cross the 
bridge. this was the bridge that led across the river to the king's doors. the water flowed 
dark and swift and strong beneath; and at the far end were gates before the mouth of a 
huge cave that ran into the side of a steep slope covered with trees. there the gre

bridge the elves thrust their prisoners, but bilbo hesitated in the rear. he did not at all 
like the look of the cavern-mouth and he only made up his mind not to desert his friends 
just in time to scuttle over at the heels of the fast elves, before the great gates of the king 
closed behind them with a clang. 
inside the passages were lit with red torch-light, and the elf-guards sang as they 
marched along the twisting, crossing, and echoing paths. these were not like those of 
the goblin-cities: they were smaller, less deep underground, and filled with a cleaner air.

then if bilbo was very nimble, he could slip out just behind them; though it was a 
dangerous thing to do. more than once he was nearly caught in the doors, as they 
clashed together when the last elf passed; yet he did not dare to march among them

he did no good. 
he did not wish to desert the dwarves, and indeed he did not know where in the world to 
go without them. he could not keep up with the hunting elves all the time they were out, 
so he never discovered the ways out of the wood, and was left to wander miserably in 
the forest, terrified of losing himself, until a chance came of returning. he was hungry too 
outside, for he was no hunter; but inside the caves he could pick up a living of some sort 
by stealing food from store or table when no one was at hand. "i am like a burglar that 
can't get away, but must go on miserably burgling the same house day after day," he 
thought. "this is the dr

other way had disappeared; until in fact the remarkable mr. invisible baggins (of whom 
he began to have a very high opinion indeed) had altogether failed to think of 
something clever. 
the other dwarves quite agreed when they got the message. they all thought their own 
shares in the treasure (which they quite regarded as theirs, in spite of their plight and the 
still unconquered dragon) would suffer seriously if the wood-elves claimed part of it, and 
they all trusted bilbo. 
just what gandalf had said would happen, you see. perhaps that war part of his reason 
for going off and leaving them.

depended on by everyone, and he wished he had the wizard at hand.

river to prevent anyone coming in or 
out that way. but the portcullis was often open, for a good deal of traffic went out and in 
by the water-gate. if anyone had come in that way, he would have found himself in a 
dark rough tunnel leading deep into the heart of the hill; but at one point where it passed 
under the caves the roof had been cut away and covered with great oaken trapdoors. 
these opened upwards into the king's cellars. there stood barrels, and barrels, and 
barrels; for the wood-elves, and especially their king, were very fond of wine, though no 
vines grew in those parts. the wine, and other goods, were brought from far away, from 
their kinsfolk in the south, or from the vineyards of men in distant lands. 
hiding behind one of the largest barrels bilbo discovered the trapdoors and their use, 
and lurking there, listening to the talk of the king's servants, he learned how the wine and 
other goods came up the rivers, or over land, to the long lake. it seemed a town of men

still throve there, built out on bridges far into the water as a protection against enemies 
of all sorts, and especially against the dragon of the mountain. from lake-town the 
barrels were brought up the forest river. often they were just tied together like big rafts 
and poled or rowed up the stream; sometimes they were loaded on to flat boats. 
when the barrels were empty the elves cast them through the trapdoors, opened the 
water-gate, and out the barrels floated on the stream, bobbing along, until they were 
carried by the current to a place far down the river where the bank jutted out, near to the 
very eastern edge of mirkwood. there they were collected and tied together and floated 
back to lake-town, which stood close to the point where the forest river flowed into the 
long lake. 
for some time bilbo sat and thought about this water-gate, and wondered if it could

"very good," laughed the chief of the guards. "i'll taste with you, and see if it is fit for the 
king's table. there is a feast tonight and it would not do to send up poor stuff!" 
when he heard this bilbo was all in a flutter, for he saw that luck was with him and he 
had a chance at once to try his desperate plan. he followed the two elves, until they 
entered a small cellar and sat down at a table on which two large flagons were set. soon 
they began to drink and laugh merrily. 
luck of an unusual kind was with bilbo then. it must be potent wine to make a wood-elf 
drowsy; but this wine, it would seem, was the heady vintage of the great gardens of 

dorwinion, not meant for his soldiers or his servants, but for the king's feasts only, and 
for smaller bowls, not for the butler's great flagons. 
very soon the chief guard nodded

disappear. disappear! we have got to get busy very quick, if that is to happen!" balin 
was told off to watch the guard and the butler and give warning if they stirred. the rest 
went into the adjoining cellar with the trapdoors. 
there was little time to lose. before long, as bilbo knew, some elves were under orders 
to come down and help the butler get the empty barrels through the doors into the 
stream. these were in fact already standing in rows in the middle of the floor waiting to 
be pushed off. some of them were wine-barrels, and these were not much use, as they 
could not easily be opened at the end without a deal of noise, nor could they easily be 
secured again. but among them were several others which had been used for bringing 
other stuffs, butter, apples, and all sorts of t

es and said he was stifling, even before his lid was on. bilbo had done what he 
could to close holes in the sides of the barrels, and to fix on all the lids as safely as could 
be managed, and now he was left alone again, running round putting the finishing 
touches-to the packing, and hoping against hope that his plan would come off. 
it had not been a-bit too soon. only a minute or two after balin's lid had been fitted on 
there came the sound of voices and the flicker of lights. a number of elves came 
laughing and talking into the cellars and singing snatches of song. they had left a merry 
feast in one of the halls and were bent on returning as soon as they could. "where's old 
galion, the butler?" said one. "i haven't seen him at the tables tonight. he ought to be 
here now to show us what is to be done." 
"i shall be angry if the old slowcoach is late," said another. "i have no wish to waste time 
down here while the song is up!" 
"ha, ha!" came a cry. "here's the old villain with h

with many a clash and a bump, thudding on top of ones below, smacking into the water, 
jostling against the walls of the tunnel, knocking into one another, and bobbing away 
down the current. 
it was just at this moment that bilbo suddenly discovered the weak point in his plan. 
most likely you saw it some time ago and have been laughing at him; but i don't suppose 
you would have done half as well yourselves in his place. of course he was not in a 
barrel himself, nor was there anyone to pack him in, even if there had been a chance! it 
looked as if he would certainly lose his friends this time (nearly all of them had already 
disappeared through the dark trap-door), and get utterly left behind and have to stay 
lurking as a permanent burglar in the elf-caves for ever. for even if he could have 
escaped through the upper gates at once, he had precious small chance of ever finding

they were out of the wood. while all these thoughts were passing through his mind, the

gone to haul on the ropes which pulled up the portcullis at the water-gate so as to let out 
the barrels as soon as they were all afloat below.

into the water he fell, splash! into the cold dark water with the barrel on top of him. he 
came up again spluttering and clinging to the wood like a rat, but for all his efforts he 
could not scramble on top. every time he tried, the barrel rolled round and ducked him 
under again. it was really empty, and floated light as a cork. though his ears were full of 
water, he could hear the elves still singing in the cellar above. 
then suddenly the trapdoors fell to with a boom and their voices faded away. 
he was in the dark tunnel, floating in icy water, all alone-for you cannot count friends that 
are all packed up in barrels. 
very soon a grey patch came up in the darkness ahead. he heard the creak of the 
water-gate being hauled up, and he found that he was in the midst of a bobbing and 
bumping mass of casks and tubs all pressing together to pass under the arch and get

of the night he had to pass wet as he was and far from a fire, but the bottle helped him to 
do that, and he actually dozed a little on some dry leaves, even though the year was 
getting late and the air was chilly. 
he woke again with a specially loud sneeze. it was already grey morning, and there was 
a merry racket down by the river. they were making up a raft of barrels, and the raft-
elves would soon be steering it off down the stream to lake-town. bilbo sneezed again. 
he was no longer dripping but he felt cold all over. he scrambled down as fast as his stiff 
legs would take him and managed just in time to get on to the mass of casks without 
being noticed in the general bustle. luckily there was no sun at the time to cast an 
awkward shadow, and for a mercy he did not sneeze again for a good while.

said. 
"no time now!" cried the raftman. "shove off!" 
and off they went at last, slowly at first, until they had passed the point of rock where 
other elves stood to fend them off with poles, and then quicker and quicker as they 
caught the main stream and went sailing away down, down towards the lake. 
they had escaped the dungeons of the king and were through the wood, but whether 
alive or dead still remains to be seen.

d that he was very fortunate ever to have seen it at all, even 
from this distance. dreary as had been his imprisonment and unpleasant as was his 
position (to say nothing of the poor dwarves underneath him) still, he had been more 
lucky than he had guessed. the talk was all of the trade that came and went on the 
waterways and the growth of the traffic on the river, as the roads out of the east towards 
mirkwood vanished or fell into disuse; and of the bickerings of the lake-men and the 
wood-elves about the upkeep of the forest river and the care of the banks. 
those lands had changed much since the days when dwarves dwelt in the mountain, 
days which most people now remembered only as a very shadowy tradition. they had 
changed even in recent years, and since the last news that gandalf had had of them. 
great floods and rains had swollen the waters that flowed east; and there had been an 
earthquake or two (which some were inclined to attribute to the dragon-alluding to him

 the marshes 
and bogs had spread wider and wider on either side. paths had vanished, and many a 
rider and wanderer too, if they had tried to find the lost ways across. the elf-road 
through the wood which the dwarves had followed on the advice of beorn now came to a 
doubtful and little used end at the eastern edge of the forest; only the river offered any 
longer a safe way from the skirts of mirkwood in the north to the mountain-shadowed 
plains beyond, and the river was guarded by the wood-elves' king. 
so you see bilbo had come in the end by the only road that was any good. 
it might have been some comfort to mr. baggins shivering on the barrels, if he had 
known that news of this had reached gandalf far away and given him great anxiety, and 
that he was in fact finishing his other business (which does not come into this tale) and 
getting ready to come in search of thorin's company. 
but bilbo did not know it. 
all he knew was that the river seemed to go on and on and on for ever, an

p there, 
where the stars of the wain were already twinkling, the running river came down into 
the lake from dale and with the forest river filled with deep waters what must once 
have been a great deep rocky valley. at the southern end the doubled waters poured out 
again over high waterfalls and ran away hurriedly to unknown lands. in the still evening 
air the noise of the falls could be heard like a distant roar. 
not far from the mouth of the forest river was the strange town he heard the elves 
speak of in the king's cellars. it was not built on the shore, though there were a few huts 
and buildings there, but right out on the surface of the lake, protected from the swirl of 
the entering river by a promontory of rock which formed a calm bay. a great . bridge 
made of wood ran out to where on huge piles made of forest trees was built a busy 
wooden town, not a town of elves but of men, who still dared to dwell here under the 
shadow of the distant dragon-mountain. they still throve o

soon the raft was drawn out of the current of the forest river and towed away round the 
high shoulder of rock into the little bay of lake-town. there it was moored not far from 
the shoreward head of the great bridge. soon men would come up from the south and 
take some of the casks away, and others they would fill with goods they had brought to 
be taken back up the stream to the wood-elves' home. in the meanwhile the barrels 
were left afloat while the elves of the raft and the boatmen went to feast in lake-town. 
they would have been surprised, if they could have seen what happened down by the 
shore, after they had gone and the shades of night had fallen. 
first of all a barrel was cut loose by bilbo and pushed to the shore and opened. groans 
came from inside, and out crept a most unhappy dwarf. wet straw was in his draggled

"i suggest lake-town," said bilbo, "what else is there?" nothing else could, of course, be

shore to the great bridge. there were guards at the head of it, but they were not keeping 
very careful watch, for it was so long since there had been any real need. except for 
occasional squabbles about river-tolls they were friends with the wood-elves. other folk 
were far away; and some of the younger people in the town openly doubted the 
existence of any dragon in the mountain, and laughed at the greybeards and gammers 
who said that they had seen him flying in the sky in their young days. that being so it is 
not surprising that the guards were drinking and laughing by a fire in their hut, and did 
not hear the noise of the unpacking of the dwarves or the footsteps of the four scouts. 
their astonishment was enormous when thorin oakenshi

"if you come in peace lay down your arms!" said the captain. 
"we have none," said thorin, and it was true enough: their knives had been taken from 
them by the wood-elves, and the great sword orcrist too. bilbo had his short sword, 
hidden as usual, but he said nothing about that. "we have no need of weapons, who 
return at last to our own as spoken of old. nor could we fight against so many. take us 
to your master!" 
"he is at feast," said the captain.

these solemnities. "we are worn and famished after our long road and we have sick

pressing forward before the master's table they cried: 
"these are prisoners of our king that have escaped, wandering vagabond dwarves that 
could not give any good account of themselves, sneaking through the woods and 
molesting our people!"

waylaid by the elven-king and imprisoned without

hinder the homecoming spoken of old. nor is this town in the wood-elves' realm. i speak 
to the master of the town of the men of the lake, not to the raft-men of the king." 
then the master hesitated and looked from one to the other. the elvenking was very 
powerful in those parts and the master wished for no enmity with him, nor did he think 
much of old songs, giving his mind to .trade and tolls, to cargoes and gold, to which habit 
he owed his position. others were of different mind, however, and quickly the matter was 
settled without him. the news had spread f

and the rivers golden run. 
the streams shall run in gladness, 
the lakes shall shine and burn, 
and sorrow fail and sadness 
at the mountain-king's return!" 
 
so they sang, or very like that, only there was a great deal more of it, and there was 
much shouting as well as the music of harps and of fiddles mixed up with it. indeed such 
excitement had not been known in the town in the memory of the oldest grandfather. the 
wood-elves themselves began to wonder greatly and even to be afraid. they did not 
know of course how thorin had escaped, and they began to think their king might have 
made a serious mistake. 

as for the master he saw there was nothing else for it but to obey the general clamour, 
for the moment at any rate, and to pretend to believe that thorin was what he said. so 
he gave up to him his own great chair and set fili and kili beside him in places of 
honour. even bilbo was given a seat at the high tabl

y day. there were no more groans or grumbles. they drank his health, and they 
patted him on the back, and they made a great fuss of him; which was just as well, for he 
was not feeling particularly cheerful. he had not forgotten the look of the mountain, nor 
the thought of the dragon, and he had besides a shocking cold. for three days he 
sneezed and coughed, and he could not go out, and even after that his speeches at 
banquets were limited to "thag you very buch." 
in the meanwhile the wood-elves had gone back up the forest river with their cargoes, 
and there was great excitement in the king's palace. i have never heard what happened 
to the chief of the guards and the butler. nothing of course was ever said about keys or 
barrels while the dwarves stayed in lake-town, and bilbo was careful never to become 
invisible. still, i daresay, more was guessed than was known, though doubtless mr. 
baggins remained a bit of a mystery. in any case the king knew now the dwarves' 
errand, or thoug

him. there it is: dwarves are not heroes, but calculating folk with a great idea of the 
value of money; some are tricky and treacherous and pretty bad lots; some are not, but 
are decent enough people like thorin and company, if you don't expect too much. 
the stars were coming out behind him in a pale sky barred with black when the hobbit 
crept through the enchanted door and stole into the mountain. it was far easier going 
than he expected. this was no goblin entrance, or rough wood-elves' cave. it was a 
passage made by dwarves, at the height of their wealth and skill: straight as a ruler, 
smooth-floored and smooth-sided, going with a gentle never-varying slope direct-to 
some distant end in the blackness below. 
after a while balin bade bilbo "good luck!" and stopped where he could still see the faint 
outline of the door, and by a trick of, the echoes of the tunnel hear the rustle of the 
whispering voices of the others just outside.

fragments of gold from his long lying on his costly bed. 
behind him where the walls were nearest could dimly be seen coats of mail, helms and 
axes, swords and spears hanging; and there in rows stood great jars and vessels filled 
with a wealth that could not be guessed. to say that bilbo's breath was taken away is no 
description at all. there are no words left to express his staggerment, since men 
changed the language that they learned of elves in the days when all the world was 
wonderful. bilbo had heard tell and sing of dragon-hoards before, but the splendour, the 
lust, the glory of such treasure had never yet come home to him. his heart was filled and 
pierced with enchantment and with the desire of dwarves; and he gazed motionless, 
almost forgetting the frightful guardian, at the gold beyond price and count. 
he gazed for what seemed an age, before drawn almost against his will, he stole from 
the shadow of the doorway, across

no more of that." 
nor did he. balin was overjoyed to see the hobbit again, and as delighted as he was 
surprised. he picked bilbo up and carried him out into the open air. 
it was midnight and clouds had covered the stars, but bilbo lay with his eyes shut, 
gasping and taking pleasure in the feel of the fresh air again, and hardly noticing the 
excitement of the dwarves, or how they praised him and patted him on the back and put 
themselves and all their families for generations to come at his service. 
the dwarves were still passing the cup from hand to hand and talking delightedly of the 
recovery of their treasure, when suddenly a vast rumbling woke in the mountain 
underneath as if it was an old volcano that had made up its mind to start eruptions once 
again. the door behind them was pulled nearly to, and blocked from closing with a 
stone, but up the long tunnel came the dreadful echoes, from far down in the depths, of

still in tune. the dark hall was filled with a melody that had 
long been silent. but most of the dwarves were more practical; they gathered gems and 
stuffed their pockets, and let what they could not carry far back through their fingers with 
a sigh. thorin was not least among these; but always he searched from side to side for 
something which he could not find. it was the arkenstone but he spoke of it yet to no 
one. 
now the dwarves took down mail and weapons from the walls, and armed themselves. 
royal indeed did thorin look, clad in a coat of gold-plated rings, with a silver hafted axe 
in a belt crusted with scarlet stones. 
"mr. baggins!" he cried. "here is the first payment of your reward! cast off your old coat 
and put on this!" 
with that he put on bilbo a small coat of mail, wrought for some young elf-prince long 
ago. it was of silver-steel which the elves call mithril, and with it went a belt of pearls and 
crystals. a light helm of figured leather, strengthened beneath with

ected to see smaug perched there like a 
bird on a steeple. 
"we must take our chance of that," said thorin. "we can go no further today." 
"hear, hear!" cried bilbo, and flung himself on the ground. 
in the rock-chamber there would have been room for a hundred, and there was a small 
chamber further in, more removed from the cold outside. it was quite deserted; not even 
wild animals seemed to have used it in all the days of smaug's dominion. there they laid 
their burdens; and some threw themselves down at once and slept, but the others sat 
near the outer door and discussed their plans. 
in all their talk they came perpetually back to one thing: where was smaug? they looked 
west and there was nothing, and east there was nothing, and in the south there was no 
sign of the dragon, but there was a gathering of very many birds. at that they gazed and 
wondered; but they were no nearer understanding it, when the first cold stars came out.

 they looked seldom at it, for it

suddenly it flickered back to view; a brief glow touched it and faded. 
"look!" said one. "the lights again! last night the watchmen saw them start and fade 
from midnight until dawn. something is happening up there." 
"perhaps the king under the mountain is forging gold," said another. "it is long since he 
went north. it is time the songs began to prove themselves again." 

"which king?" said another with a grim voice. "as like as not it is the marauding fire of 
the dragon, the only king under the mountain we have ever known." 
"you are always foreboding gloomy things!" said the others. "anything from floods to 
poisoned fish. think of something cheerful!" 
then suddenly a great light appeared in the low place in the hills and the northern end of 
the lake turned golden.

meanwhile bard took the lead, and ordered things as he wished, though always in the 
master's name, and he had a hard task to govern the people and direct the preparations 
for their protection and housing. probably most of them would have perished in the 
winter that now hurried after autumn, if help had not been to hand. but help came swiftly; 
for bard at once had speedy messengers sent up the river to the forest to ask the aid of 
the king of the elves of the wood, and these messengers had found a host already on 
the move, although it was then only the third day after the fall of smaug. 
the elvenking had received news from his own messengers and from the birds that 
loved his folk, and already knew much of what had happened. very great indeed was the 
commotion among all things with wings that dwelt on the borders of the desolation of the 
dragon. the air was filled with circling flocks, and their swift-flying messengers flew here

e him, for they thought that 
war was awakening again, such as had not been in those parts for a long age. but the 
king, when he received the prayers of bard, had pity, for he was the lord of a good and 
kindly people; so turning his march, which had at first been direct towards the mountain, 
he hastened now down the river to the long lake. he had not boats or rafts enough for 
his host, and they were forced to go the slower way by foot; but great store of goods he 
sent ahead by water. still elves are light-footed, and though they were not in these days 
much used to the marches and the treacherous lands between the forest and the lake, 
their going was swift. only five days after the death of the dragon they came upon the 
shores and looked on the ruins of the town. their welcome was good, as may be 
expected, and the men and their master were ready to make any bargain for the future in 
return for the elvenking's aid. 
their plans were soon made. with the women and the children, the ol

and also under the master's direction they began the planning of a new town, designed 
more fair and large even than before, but not in the same place. they removed

"so much for joy, thorin oakenshield. you may go back to your halls in safety; all the 
treasure is yours-for the moment. but many are gathering hither beside the birds. the 
news of the death of the guardian has already gone far and wide, and the legend of the 
wealth of thror has not lost in the telling during many years; many are eager for a share 
of the spoil. already a host of the elves is on the way, and carrion birds are with them 
hoping for battle and slaughter. by the lake men murmur that their sorrows are due to 
the dwarves; for they are homeless and many have died, and smaug has destroyed 
their town. they too think to find amends from your treasure, whether you are alive or 
dead.

the long desolation; but it may cost you dear in gold. i have spoken." 
then thorin burst forth in anger: "our thanks, rac carc's son. you and your people

ad turned aside to the lake, and they still had a breathing space. better 
still, they heard that three of their ponies had escaped and were wandering wild far down 
the banks of the running river, not far from where the rest of their stores had been left. 
so while the others went on with their work, fili and kili were sent, guided by a raven, to 
find the ponies and bring back all they could. 
they were four days gone, and by that time they knew that the joined armies of the 
lake-men and the elves were hurrying towards the mountain. but now their hopes were 
higher; for they had food for some weeks with carechiefly cram, of course, and they were 
very tired of it; but cram is much better than nothing-and already the gate was blocked 
with a wall of squared stones laid dry, but very thick and high across the opening. there 
were holes in the wall through which they could see (or shoot) but no entrance. they 
climbed in or out with ladders, and hauled stuff up with ropes. for the issuing o

then bilbo longed to escape from the dark fortress and to go down and join in the mirth 
and feasting by the fires. some of the younger dwarves were moved in their hearts, too, 
and they muttered that they wished things had fallen out otherwise and that they might 
welcome such folk as friends; but thorin scowled. 
then the dwarves themselves brought forth harps and instruments regained from the 
hoard, and made music to soften his mood; but their song was not as elvish song, and 
was much like the song they had sung long before in bilbo's little hobbit-hole.

battle in the valley. i do not call this counsel good. though they are a grim folk, they are 
not likely to overcome the host that besets you; and even if they did so, what will you 
gain? winter and snow is hastening behind them. how shall you be fed without the 
friendship and goodwill of the lands about you? the treasure is likely to be your death, 
though the dragon is no more!"' 
but thorin was not moved. "winter and snow will bite both men and elves," he said, "and 
they may find their dwelling in the waste grievous to bear. with my friends behind them 
and winter upon them, they will perhaps be in softer mood to parley with." 
that night bilbo made up his mind. the sky was black and moonless. as soon as it was 
full dark, he went to a corner of an inner chamber just within the gate and drew from his 
bundle a rope, and also the arkenstone wrapped in a rag. then he climbed to the top of

strange to him. at last he came to the bend where he had to cross the water, if he was to 
make for the camp, as he wished. the bed of the stream was there shallow but already 
broad, and fording it in the dark was not easy for the little hobbit. he was nearly across 
when he missed his footing on a round stone and fell into the cold water with a splash. 
he had barely scrambled out on the far bank, shivering and spluttering, when up came 
elves in the gloom with bright lanterns and searched for the cause of the noise. 
"that was no fish!" one said. "there is a spy about. hide your lights! 
they will help him more than us, if it is that queer little creature that is said to be their 
servant." 
"servant, indeed!" snorted bilbo; and in the middle of his snort he sneezed loudly, and 
the elves immediately gathered towards the sound. 
"let's have a light!" he said. "i am here, if you want me!" and he slipped off his ring, and

after another. 
"i am mr. bilbo baggins," he answered, "companion of thorin, if you want to know. i 
know your king well by sight, though perhaps he doesn't know me to look at. but bard 
will remember me, and it is bard i particularly want to see." 
"indeed!" said they, "and what may be your business?" 
"whatever it is, it's my own, my good elves. but if you wish ever to get back to your own 
woods from this cold cheerless place," he answered shivering, "you will take me along 
quiet to a fire, where i can dry-and then you will let me speak to your chiefs as quick as 
may be. i have only an hour or two to spare." 
that is how it came about that some two hours after his escape from the gate, bilbo was

le metal mesh, the secret of whose making was 
possessed by dain's people. 
the dwarves are exceedingly strong for their height, but most of these were strong even 
for dwarves. in battle they wielded heavy two-handed mattocks; but each of them had 
also a short broad sword at his side and a round shield slung at his back. their beards 

were forked and plaited and thrust into their belts. their caps were of iron and they were 
shod with iron, and their faces were grim. trumpets called men and elves to arms. 
before long the dwarves could be seen coming up the valley at a great pace. they 
halted between the river and the eastern spur; but a few held on their way, and crossing 
the river drew near the camp; and there they laid down their weapons and held up their 
hands in sign of peace. bard went out to meet them, and with him went bilbo. 
"we are sent from dain son of nain," they said when questioned. "we are hastening to 
our kinsmen in the mountain, since we learn that the kingdom of o

amazement and confusion fell upon them all. even as gandalf had been speaking the 
darkness grew. the dwarves halted and gazed at the sky. the elves cried out with many 
voices. 
"come!" called gandalf. "there is yet time for council. let dain son of nain come swiftly 
to us!" 
so began a battle that none had expected; and it was called the battle of five armies, 
and it was very terrible. upon one side were the goblins and the wild wolves, and upon 
the other were elves and men and dwarves. this is how it fell out. ever since the fall of 
the great goblin of the misty mountains the hatred of their race for the dwarves had 
been rekindled t

ut in the broken lands which divided the lonely mountain from 
the hills behind. how much gandalf knew cannot be said, but it is plain that he had not 
expected this sudden assault. 
this is the plan that he made in council with the elvenking and with bard; and with dain, 
for the dwarf-lord now joined them: the goblins were the foes of all, and at their coming 
all other quarrels were forgotten. their only hope was to lure the goblins into the valley 
between the arms of the mountain; and themselves to man the great spurs that struck 
south and east. yet this would be perilous, if the goblins were in sufficient numbers to 
overrun the mountain itself, and so attack them also from behind and above; but there 
was no time for make any other plan, or to summon any help. 
soon the thunder passed, rolling away to the south-east; but the batcloud came, flying 
lower, over the shoulder of the mountain, and whirled above them shutting out the light 
and filling them with dread. 
"to the mountain!"

 called bard. "to the mountain! let us take our places while there is

on the southern spur, in its lower slopes and in the rocks at its feet, the elves were set; 
on the eastern spur were men and dwarves. but bard and some of the nimblest of men 
and elves climbed to the height of the eastern shoulder to gain a view to the north. soon 
they could see the lands before the mountain's feet black with a hurrying multitude. ere 
long the vanguard swirled round the spur's end and came rushing into dale. these were 
the swiftest wolfriders, and already their cries and howls rent the air afar. a few brave 
men were strung before them to make a feint of resistance, and many there fell before 
the rest drew back and fled to either side. as gandalf had hope

 one he was most proud of, and most 
fond of recalling long afterwards, although he was quite unimportant in it. actually i must 
say he put on his ring early in the business, and vanished from sight, if not from all 
danger. a magic ring of that sort is not a complete protection in a goblin charge, nor 
does it stop flying arrows and wild spears; but it does help in getting out of the way, and 
it prevents your head from being specially chosen for a sweeping stroke by a goblin 
swordsman. 
the elves were the first to charge. their hatred for the goblins is cold and bitter. their 
spears and swords shone in the gloom with a gleam of chill flame, so deadly was the 
wrath of the hands that held them. as soon as the host of their enemies was dense in 
the valley, they sent against it a shower of arrows, and each flickered as it fled as if with 
stinging fire. behind the arrows a thousand of their spearmen leapt down and charged. 
the yells were deafening. the rocks were stained black with gobl

in blood. just as the 
goblins were recovering from the onslaught and the elf-charge was halted, there rosen 
from across the valley a deep-throated roar. with cries of "moria!" and "dain, dain!" the 
dwarves of the iron hills plunged in, wielding their mattocks, upon the other side; and 
beside them came the men of the lake with long swords. 
panic came upon the goblins; and even as they turned to meet this new attack, the 
elves charged again with renewed numbers. already many of the goblins were flying 
back down the river to escape from the trap: and many of their own wolves were turning 
upon them and rending the dead and the wounded. victory seemed at hand, when a cry 
rang out on the heights above. 
goblins had scaled the mountain from the other side and already many were on the 
slopes above the gate, and others were streaming down recklessly, heedless of those

day drew on. the goblins gathered again in the valley. there a host of wargs came 
ravening and with them came the bodyguard of bolg, goblins of huge size with scimitars 
of steel. soon actual darkness was coming into a stormy sky; while still the great bats 
swirled about the heads and ears of elves and men, or fastened vampire-like on the 
stricken. now bard was fighting to defend the eastern spur, and yet giving slowly back; 
and the elf-lords were at bay about their king upon the southern arm, near to the watch-
post on ravenhill. 
suddenly there was a great shout, and from the gate came a trumpet call.

rocks were buried down from on high by the goblins above; but they held on leapt down 
to the falls' foot, and rushed forward to battle. wolf and rider fell or fled before them. 
thorin wielded his axe with mighty strokes, and nothing seemed to harm him.

down, heedless of order, rushed all the dwarves of dain to his help. down too came 
many of the lake-men, for bard could not restrain them; and out upon the other side 
came many of the spearmen of the elves. once again the goblins were stricken in the

widened his onset grew ever slower. his numbers were too few. 
his flanks were unguarded. soon the attackers were attacked, and they were forced into 
a great ring, facing every way, hemmed all about with goblins and wolves returning to 
the assault. the bodyguard of bolg came howling against them, and drove in upon their 
ranks like waves upon cliffs of sand. their friends could not help them, for the assault 
from the mountain was renewed with redoubled force, and upon either side men and 
elves were being slowly beaten down. 
on all this bilbo looked with misery. he had taken his stand on ravenhill among the 
elves-partly because there was more chance of escape from that point, and partly (with 
the more tookish part of his mind) because if he was going to be in a last desperate 
stand, he preferred on the whole to defend the elvenking. gandalf, too, i may say, was 
there, sitting on the ground as if in deep thought, preparing, i suppose, some last blast of 
magic before the end.

t did not seem far off. "it will not be long now," thought bilbo, "before the goblins win 
the gate, and we are all slaughtered or driven down and captured. really it is enough to 
make one weep, after all one has gone through. i would rather old smaug had been left 
with all the wretched treasure, than that these vile creatures should get it, and poor old 
bombur, and balin and fili and kili and all the rest come to a bad end; and bard too, and 
the lake-men and the merry elves. misery me! i have heard songs of many battles, and i 
have always understood that defeat may be glorious. it seems very uncomfortable, not 
to say distressing. i wish i was well out of it." 
the clouds were torn by the wind, and a red sunset slashed the west. 
seeing the sudden gleam in the gloom bilbo looked round. he gave a great cry: he had 
seen a sight that made his heart leap, dark shapes small yet majestic against the distant 
glow. 
"the eagles! the eagles!" he shouted. "the eagles are

bilbo's eyes were seldom wrong. the eagles were coming down the wind, line after line, 
in such a host as must have gathered from all the eyries of the north. 
"the eagles! the eagles!" bilbo cried, dancing and waving his arms. if the elves could 
not see him they could hear him. soon they too took up the cry, and it echoed across the 
valley. many wondering eyes looked up, though as yet nothing could be seen except 
from the southern shoulders of the mountain. 
"the eagles!" cried bilbo once more, but at that moment a stone hurtling from above 
smote heavily on his helm, and he fell with a crash and knew no more.

of ravenhill, and no one was near. a cloudless day, but cold, was broad above him. he 
was shaking, and as chilled as stone, but his head burned with fire. 
"now i wonder what has happened?" he said to himself. "at any rate i am not yet one of 
the fallen heroes; but i suppose there is still time enough for that!" 
he sat up painfully. looking into the valley he could see no living goblins. after a while 
as his head cleared a little, he thought he could see elves moving in the rocks below. he 
rubbed his eyes. surely there was a camp still in the plain some distance off; and there 

was a coming and going about the gate? dwarves seemed to be busy removing the 
wall. but all was deadly still. there was no call and no echo of a song. sorrow seemed 
to be in the air. "victory after all, i suppose!" he said, feeling his aching head. "well, 
it seems a very gloomy business." 
suddenly he was aware of a man climbing up and coming towards him. 
"hullo there!"

g; from 
their watchfulness the movements in the mountains could not be altogether hid. so they 
too had gathered in great numbers, under the great eagle of the misty mountains; and at 
length smelling battle from afar they had come speeding down the gale in the nick of 
time. they it was who dislodged the goblins from the mountainslopes, casting them over 
precipices, or driving them down shrieking and bewildered among their foes. it was not 
long before they had freed the lonely mountain, and elves and men on either side of the 
valley could come at last to the help of the battle below. 
but even with the eagles they were still outnumbered. 
in that last hour beorn himself had appeared - no one knew how or from where. he 
came alone, and in bear's shape; and he seemed to have grown almost to giant-size in 
his wrath. the roar of his voice was like drums and guns; and he tossed wolves and 
goblins from his path like straws and feathers. he fell upon their rear, and broke like a 
clap of th

and pulled down bolg himself and crushed him. then dismay fell on the goblins and 
they fled in all directions. but weariness left their enemies with the coming of new hope, 
and they pursued them closely, and prevented most of them from escaping where they 
could. they drove many of them into the running river, and such as fled south or west 
they hunted into the marshes about the forest river; and there the greater part of the 
last fugitives perished, while those that came hardly to the wood-elves' realm were there 
slain, or drawn in to die in the trackless dark of mirkwood. songs have said that three 
parts of the goblin warriors of the north perished on that day, and the mountains had 
peace for many a year. 
victory had been assured before the fall of night, but the pursuit was still on foot, when 
bilbo returned to the camp; and not many were in the valley save the more grievously 
wounded. 
"where are the eagles?" he asked gandalf that evening, as he lay wrapped in many 
warm blank

 have i earned such a gift, o hobbit?" said the king. 
"well, er, i thought, don't you know," said bilbo rather confused, "that, er, some little 
return should be made for your, er, hospitality. i mean even a burglar has his feelings. i 
have drunk much of your wine and eaten much of your bread." 
"i will take your gift, o bilbo the magnificent!" said the king gravely. 
"and i name you elf-friend and blessed. may your shadow never grow less (or stealing 
would be too easy)! farewell!" 
then the elves turned towards the forest, and bilbo started on his long road home. 
he had many hardships and adventures before he got back. the wild was still the wild, 
and there were many other things in it in those days besides goblins; but he was well 
guided and well guarded-the wizard was with him, and beorn for much of the way-and 
he was never in great danger again. anyway by mid-winter gandalf and bilbo had come 
all the way back, along both edges of the forest, to the doors of beorn's house; and

the last stage 
 
it was on may the first that the two came back at last to the brink of the valley of 
rivendell, where stood the last (or the first) homely house. 
again it was evening, their ponies were tired, especially the one that carried the 
baggage; and they all felt in need of rest. as they rode down the steep path, bilbo heard 
the elves still singing in the trees, as if they had not stopped since he left; and as soon 
as their riders came down into the lower glades of the wood they burst into a song of 
much the same kind as before. 
this is something like it: 
 
"the dragon is withered, 
his bones are now crumbled; 

his armour is shivered, 
his splendour is humbled! 
though sword shall be rusted, 
and throne and crown perish 
with strength that men trusted 
and wealth that they cherish,

then the elves of the valley came out and greeted them and led them across the water 
to the house of elrond. there a warm welcome was made them, and there were many 
eager ears that evening to hear the tale of their adventures. gandalf it was who spoke, 
for bilbo was fallen quiet and drowsy. 
most of the tale he knew, for he had been in it, and had himself told much of it to the 
wizard on their homeward way or in the house of beorn; but every now and again he 
would open one eye, and listen, when a part of

"it would be well indeed," said elrond; "but i fear that will not come about in this age of 
the world, or for many after." 
when the tale of their joumeyings was told, there were other tales, and yet more tales, 
tales of long ago, and tales . of new things, and tales of no time at all, till bilbo's head fell 
forward on his chest, and he snored comfortably in a corner. 
he woke to find himself in a white bed, and the moon shining through an open window. 
below it many elves were singing loud and clear on the banks of the stream. 
"sing all ye joyful, now sing all together? 
the wind's in the free-top, the wind's in the heather; 
the stars are in blossom, the moon is in flower, 
and bright are the windows of night in her tower.

e thank you," they answered with 
laughter. "it is drawing towards dawn, and you have slept now since the night's 
beginning. tomorrow, perhaps, you will be cured of weariness." 
"a little sleep does a great cure in the house of elrond," said he; "but i will take all the 
cure i can get. a second good night, fair friends!" and with that he went back to bed and 
slept till late morning. 
weariness fell from him soon in that house, and he had many a merry jest and dance, 
early and late, with the elves of the valley. yet even that place could not long delay him 
now, and he thought always of his own home. after a week, therefore, he said farewell to 
elrond, and giving him such small gifts as he would accept, he rode away with gandalf. 
even as they left the valley the sky darkened in the west before them, and wind and rain 
came up to meet them. 
"merry is may-time!" said bilbo, as the rain beat into his face. "but our back is to legends 
and we are coming home. i suppose this is a first tas

than it had been even 
in the quiet days before the unexpected party. his sword he hung over the mantelpiece. 
his coat of mail was arranged on a stand in the hall (until he lent it to a museum). his 
gold and silver was largely spent in presents, both useful and extravagant - which to a 
certain extent accounts for the affection of his nephews and his nieces. his magic ring 
he kept a great secret, for he chiefly used it when unpleasant callers came. he took to 
writing poetry and visiting the elves; and though many shook their heads and touched 
their foreheads and said "poor old baggins!" and though few believed any of his tales, 
he remained very happy to the end of his days, and those were extraordinarily long. 
one autumn evening some years afterwards bilbo was sitting in his study writing his 
memoirs - he thought of calling them "there and back again, a hobbit's holiday" - when 
there was a ring at the door. it was gandalf and a dwarf; and the dwarf was actually 
balin.

going in the lands of the mountain. it seemed they were going very well. bard had rebuilt 
the town in dale and men had gathered to him from the lake and from south and west, 
and all the valley had become tilled again and rich, and the desolation was now filled 
with birds and blossoms in spring and fruit and feasting in autumn. and lake-town was 
refounded and was more prosperous than ever, and much wealth went up and down the 
running river; and there was friendship in those parts between elves and dwarves and 
men. 
the old master had come to a bad end. bard had given him much gold for the help of 
the lake-people, but being of the kind that easily catches such disease he fell under the 
dragon-sickness, and took most of the gold and fled with it, and died of starvation in the 
waste, deserted by his companions. 
"the new master is of wiser kind," said balin, "and very popular, for, of course, he gets 
most of the credit for the present prosperity. they are making 
songs which say th
