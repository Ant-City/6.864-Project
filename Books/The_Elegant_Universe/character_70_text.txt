 patterns with spins differing from a whole number by a half unit. this led to two problems.
first,  if  string  theory  was  to  describe  all  forces  and  all  matter,  it  would  somehow  have  to
incorporate  fermionic  vibrational  patterns,  since  the  known  matter  particles  all  have  spin-1/2.
second, and far more troubling, was the realization that there was one pattern of vibration in bosonic
string theory whose mass (more precisely, whose mass squared) was negative—a so-called tachyon.
even before string theory, physicists had studied the possibility that our world might have tachyon
particles, in addition to the familiar particles that all have positive masses, but their efforts showed
that it is difficult if not impossible for such a theory to be logically sensible. similarly, in the context
of  bosonic  string  theory,  physicists  tried  all  sorts  of  fancy  footwork  to  make  sense  of  the  bizarre
prediction of a tachyon vibrational pattern, but to no avail. these

ndo  gliozzi  of  the  university  of  turin,  scherk,  and  david  olive  of  imperial
college put this pairing into the proper light. the new string theory incorporated supersymmetry, and
the  observed  pairing  of  bosonic  and  fermionic  vibrational  patterns  reflected  this  highly  symmetric
character. supersymmetric string theory—superstring theory, that is—had been born. moreover, the
work of gliozzi, scherk, and olive had one other crucial result: they showed that the troublesome
tachyon vibration of the bosonic string does not afflict the superstring. slowly, the pieces of the string
puzzle were falling into place.

nevertheless, the major initial impact of the work of ramond, and also of neveu and schwarz,
was not actually in string theory. by 1973, the physicists julius wess and bruno zumino realized that
supersymmetry—the new symmetry emerging from the reformulation of string theory—was applicable
even to theories based on point particles. they rapidly made important st

n this point-particle theory owes a great debt to string theory.

with the resurgence of superstring theory in the mid-1980s, supersymmetry has re-emerged in the
context  of  its  original  discovery.  and  in  this  framework,  the  case  for  supersymmetry  goes  well
beyond that presented in the preceding section. string theory is the only way we know of to merge
general relativity and quantum mechanics. but it's only the supersymmetric version of string theory
that  avoids  the  pernicious  tachyon  problem  and  that  has  fermionic  vibrational  patterns  that  can
account  for  the  matter  particles  constituting  the  world  around  us.  supersymmetry  therefore  comes

hand-in-hand with string theory's proposal for a quantum theory of gravity, as well as with its grand
claim  of  uniting  all  forces  and  all  of  matter.  if  string  theory  is  right,  physicists  expect  that  so  is
supersymmetry.

until  the  mid-1990s,  however,  one  particularly  troublesome  aspect  plagu

ates the properties of particles with a whole number
amount of spin (bosons) to those with half a whole (odd) number amount of spin (fermions).
symmetry. a property of a physical system that does not change when the system is transformed in
some manner. for instance, a sphere is rotationally symmetrical since its appearance does not change
if it is rotated.
symmetry  breaking.  a  reduction  in  the  amount  of symmetry  a  system  appears  to  have,  usually
associated with a phase transition.
tachyon.  particle  whose  mass  (squared)  is  negative;  its  presence  in  a  theory  generally  yields
inconsistencies.
thermodynamics.  laws  developed  in  the  nineteenth  century  to  describe  aspects  of  heat,  work,
energy, entropy, and their mutual evolution in a physical system.
three-brane. see brane.
three-dimensional sphere. see sphere.
time dilation. feature emerging from special relativity, in which the flow of time slows down for an
observer in motion.
