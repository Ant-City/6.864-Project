  rosalind. but is there any else longs to see this broken music in
    his sides? is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking?
    shall we see this wrestling, cousin?

  le beau. you must, if you stay here; for here is the place
    appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to perform it.

  celia. alas, he is too young; yet he looks successfully.

  frederick. how now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither to

    there is such odds in the man. in pity of the challenger's youth
    i would fain dissuade him, but he will not be entreated.

  rosalind. young man, have you challeng'd charles the wrestler?

  orlando. no, fair princess; he is the general challenger. i come
    but in, as others do, to try with him the strength of my youth.

  celia. young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years.
    you have seen cruel proof of this man's strength; if you saw

is it possible, on such a sudden, you should fall
    into so strong a liking with old sir rowland's youngest son?

  rosalind. the duke my father lov'd his father dearly.

  celia. doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly?
    by this kind of chase i should hate him, for my father hated his
    father dearly; yet i hate not orlando.

  rosalind. no, faith, hate him not, for my sake.

  celia. why should i not? doth he not deserve well?

    and get you from our court.

    duke frederick, hearing how that every day
    men of great worth resorted to this forest,
    address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,
    in his own conduct, purposely to take
    his brother here, and put him to the sword;
    and to the skirts of this wild wood he came,
