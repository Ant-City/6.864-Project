captain the honorable edward fairfax vere - 
 captain of the h.m.s. bellipotent. a
bachelor of aristocratic lineage, the forty-year-old vere has made
his mark as a distinguished sailor. his nickname, "starry vere," seems
fitting for this abstracted, intellectual figure who often shuts
himself up at sea with his books. vere remains somewhat aloof and
diffident among his peers, though he is not haughty.
