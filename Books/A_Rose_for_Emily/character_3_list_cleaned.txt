mr.[CHARACTER] - 
                emily's father. mr.[CHARACTER] is a controlling, looming presence even in death, and the community clearly sees his lasting influence over emily. he deliberately thwarts emily's attempts to find a husband in order to keep her under his control. we get glimpses of him in the story: in the crayon portrait kept on the gilt-edged easel in the parlor, and silhouetted in the doorway, horsewhip in hand, having chased off another of emily's suitors.
