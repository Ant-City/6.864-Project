    the princes orgillous, their high blood chaf'd,
    have to the port of athens sent their ships
    fraught with the ministers and instruments

act i. scene 1.
troy. before priam's palace

enter troilus armed, and pandarus

  troilus. call here my varlet; i'll unarm again.
    why should i war without the walls of troy
    that find such cruel battle here within?
    each troyan that is master of his heart,
    let him to field; troilus, alas, hath none!
  pandarus. will this gear ne'er be mended?
  troilus. the greeks are strong, and skilful to their strength,
    fierce to their skill, and to their fierceness valiant;
    but i am weaker than a woman's tear,
    tamer than sleep,

fonder than ignorance,
    less valiant than the virgin in the night,
    and skilless as unpractis'd infancy.
  pandarus. well, i have told you enough of this; for my part,
    i'll not meddle nor make no farther. he that will have a cake
    out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.
  troilus. have i not tarried?
  pandarus. ay, the grinding; but you must tarry the bolting.
  troilus. have i not tarried?
  pandarus. ay, the bolting; but you must tarry the leavening.
  troilus. still have i tarried.
  pandarus. ay, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word
    'hereafter' the kneading, the making of the cake, the heating
    of the oven, and the baking; nay, you must stay the cooling too,
    or you may chance to burn your lips.
  troilus. patience herself, what goddess e'er she be,
    doth lesser blench at suff'rance than i do.
    at priam's royal table do i sit;
    and when fair cressid comes into my thoughts-
    so, traitor, then she comes when she

 is thence.
  pandarus. well, she look'd yesternight fairer than ever i saw her
    look, or any woman else.
  troilus. i was about to tell thee: when my heart,
    as wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,
    lest hector or my father should perceive me,
    i have, as when the sun doth light a storm,
    buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile.
    but sorrow that is couch'd in seeming gladness
    is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.
  pandarus. an her hair were not somewhat darker than helen's-well,
    go to- there were no more comparison between the women. but, for
    my part, she i

s my kinswoman; i would not, as they term it,
    praise her, but i would somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as
    i did. i  will not dispraise your sister cassandra's wit; but-
  troilus. o pandarus! i tell thee, pandarus-
    when i do tell thee there my hopes lie drown'd,
    reply not in how many fathoms deep
    they lie indrench'd. i tell thee i am mad
    in cressid's love. thou answer'st 'she is fair'-
    pourest in the open ulcer of my heart-
    her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,
    handlest in thy discourse. o, that her hand,
    in whose comparison all whites are ink
    writing their own reproach; to whose soft seizure

own is harsh, and spirit of sense
    hard as the palm of ploughman! this thou tell'st me,
    as true thou tell'st me, when i say i love her;
    but, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,
    thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me
    the knife that made it.
  pandarus. i speak no more than truth.
  troilus. thou dost not speak so much.
  pandarus. faith, i'll not meddle in it. let her be as she is: if
    she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she be not, she has the
    mends in her own hands.
  troilus. good pandarus! how now, pandarus!
  pandarus. i have had my labour for my travail, ill thought on of
    her and ill thought on of you; gone between and between, but
    small thanks for my labour.
  troilus. what, art thou angry, pandarus? what, with me?
  pandarus. because she's kin

 to me, therefore she's not so fair as
    helen. an she were not kin to me, she would be as fair a friday
    as helen is on sunday. but what care i? i care not an she were a
    blackamoor; 'tis all one to me.
  troilus. say i she is not fair?
  pandarus. i do not care whether you do or no. she's a fool to stay
    behind her father. let her to the greeks; and so i'll tell her
    the next time i see her. for my part, i'll meddle nor make no
    more i' th' matter.
  troilus. pandarus!
  pandarus. not i.
  troilus. sweet pandarus!
  pandarus. pray you, speak no more to me: i will leave all
    as i found it, and there an end.
                                     exit. sound alarum
  troilus. peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!
    fools on both sides! helen must needs be fair,
    when with your blood you daily paint her thus.
    i cannot fight upon this argument;
    it is too starv'd a subject for my sword.

  aeneas. that paris is returned home, and hurt.

  alexander. queen hecuba and helen.
  cressida. and whither go they?

  cressida. this morning, uncle.
  pandarus. what were you talking of when i came? was hector arm'd
    and gone ere you came to ilium? helen was not up, was she?
  cressida. hector was gone; but helen was not up.
  pandarus. e'en so. hector was stirring early.
  cressida. that were we talking of, and of his anger.
  pandarus. was he angry?
  cressida. so he says here.
  pandarus. true, he was so; i know the cause too; he'll lay about
    him today, i can tell them that. and there's troilus will not
    come far behind him; let them take heed of troilus, i can tell
    them that too.
  cressida. what, is he angry too?
  pandarus. who, troilus? troilus is the better man of the two.
  cressida. o jupiter! there's no comparison.
  pandarus. what, not between troilus and hector? do you know a man
    if you see him?
  cressida. ay, if i ever saw him before and knew him.
  pandarus. well, i say troilus is troilus.

  cressida. he is not hector.
  pandarus. himself! no, he's not himself. would 'a were himself!
    well, the gods are above; time must friend or end. well, troilus,
    well! i would my heart were in her body! no, hector is not a
    better man than troilus.
  cressida. excuse me.
  pandarus. he is elder.
  cressida. pardon me, pardon me.
  pandarus. th' other's not come to't; you shall tell me another tale
    when th' other's come to't. hector shall not have his wit this

ome him: his own's better.
  pandarus. you have no judgment, niece. helen herself swore th'
    other day that troilus, for a brown favour, for so 'tis, i must
    confess- not brown neither-
  cressida. no, but brown.
  pandarus. faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.
  cressida. to say the truth, true and not true.
  pandarus. she prais'd his complexion above paris.
  cressida. why, paris hath colour enough.
  pandarus. so he has.
  cressida. then troilus should have too much. if she prais'd him
    above, his complexion is higher than his; he having colour
    enough, and the other higher, is too flaming praise for a good
    complexion. i had as lief helen's golden tongue had commended
    troilus for a copper nose.
  pandarus. i swear to you i think helen loves him better than paris.
  cressida. then she's a merry greek indeed.
  pandarus. nay, i am sure she does. she came to him th' other day
    into the compass'd window-and you kno

 young a man and so old a lifter?
  pandarus. but to prove to you that helen loves him: she came and
    puts me her white hand to his cloven chin-
  cressida. juno have mercy! how came it cloven?
  pandarus. why, you know, 'tis dimpled. i think his smiling becomes
    him better than any man in all phrygia.
  cressida. o, he smiles valiantly!
  pandarus. does he not?
  cressida. o yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn!
  pandarus. why, go to, then! but to prove to you that helen loves
    troilus-
  cressida. troilus will stand to the proof, if you'll prove it so.
  pandarus. troilus! why, he esteems her no more than i esteem an
    addle egg.
  cressida. if you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
    head, you would eat chickens i' th' shell.
  pandarus. i cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled his
    chin. indeed, she has a marvell's white hand, i must needs
    confess.
  cressida. without the rack.
  pandarus. and she takes upon her to spy a white hair

 on his chin.
  cressida. alas, poor chin! many a wart is richer.
  pandarus. but there was such laughing! queen hecuba laugh'd that
    her eyes ran o'er.
  cressida. with millstones.
  pandarus. and cassandra laugh'd.
  cressida. but there was a more temperate fire under the pot of her
    eyes. did her eyes run o'er too?
  pandarus. and hector laugh'd.
  cressida. at what was all this laughing?
  pandarus. marry, at the white hair that helen spied on troilus'
    chin.
  cressida. an't had been a green hair i should have laugh'd too.
  pandarus. they laugh'd not so much at the hair as at his pretty
    answer.
  cressida. what was his answer?
  pandarus. quoth she 'here's but two and fifty hairs on your chin,
    and one of them is white.'
  cressida. this is her question.
  pandarus. that's true; make no question of that. 'two and fifty
    hairs,' quoth he 'and one white. that white hair is my father,
    and all the rest are his sons.

 but modest doubt is call'd

    since the first sword was drawn about this question,
    every tithe soul 'mongst many thousand dismes
    hath been as dear as helen-i mean, of ours.
    if we have lost so many tenths of ours
    to guard a thing not ours, nor worth to us,
    had it our name, the value of one ten,
    what merit's in that reason which denies
    the yielding of her up?
  troilus. fie, fie, my brother!
    weigh you the worth and honour of a king,
    so great as our dread father's, in a scale
    of common ounces? will you with counters sum
    the past-proportion of his infinite,
    and buckle in a waist most fathomless
    with spans and inches so diminutive
    as fears and reasons? fie, for godly shame!
  helenus. no marvel though you bite so sharp at reasons,
    you are so empty of them. should not our father

  troilus. you are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest;
    you fur your gloves with reason. here are your reasons:
    you know an enemy intends you harm;
    you know a sword employ'd is perilous,
    and reason flies the object of all harm.
    who marvels, then, when helenus beholds
    a grecian and his sword, if he do set
    the very wings of reason to his heels
