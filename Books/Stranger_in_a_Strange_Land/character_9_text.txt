boone leaned over the rail, made a megaphone of his hands and cut through the high noise level. "dawn!
hey, dawn!" a woman looked up; he caught her eye, motioned her to come up. she smiled. "add a
whiskey sour to that order. fly."
 the woman showed up quickly, as did the drinks. boone swung a seat out of the box's back row

and put it cornerwise in front of him so that she could visit more easily. "folks, meet miss dawn ardent.
m'dear, that's miss boardnlan, the little lady down in the corner-and this is the famous doctor jubal
harshaw here by me-"
 "really? doctor, i think your stories are simply divine~"
 "thank you."
 "oh, i really do. i put one of your tapes on my player and let it lull me to sleep almost every
night."
 "higher praise a writer cannot expect," jubal said with a straight face.
 "that's enough, dawn," put in boone. "the young man sitting between them is . . . mr. valentine
smith the man from mars."

 he eyes came open wider as her mouth opened. "oh, my goodness!"
 boone roared. "bless you, child! i guess i really snuck up on you that time."
 she said, "are you really the man from mars?"
 "yes, miss dawn ardent."
 "just call me 'dawn.' oh, goodness!"
 boone patted her hand. "don't you know it's a sin to doubt the word of a bishop? m'dear, how
would you like to help lead the man from mars ta the light?"
 "oh, i'd love it!"
 (you certainly would, you sleek bitch! jill said to herself~ she had been growing increasingly
angry ever since miss ardent had joined them. the dress the woman was wearing was long sleeved, high
necked, and opaque-and covered nothing. it was a knit fabric almost exactly the shade o

 she stood up obediently. "yes, bishop. pleased to meet you, doctor, and miss broad. i hope
i'll see you again, mr. smith. i'll pray for you." she undulated away.
 "a fine girl, that," boone said happily. "ever catch her act, doctor?"
 "i think not. what does she do?"

 boone seemed unable to believe his ears. "you don't know?"
 "didn't you hear her name? that's dawn ardent-she's simply the highest paid peeler in all baja
california, that's who she is. men have committed suicide over her-very sad. works under an irised
spotlight and by the time she's down to her shoes, the light is just on her face and you really can't see
anything else. very effective. highly spiritual. would you believe it, looking at that sweet face now, that
she used to be a most immoral woman?"
 "i can't believe it."
 "well, she was. ask her. she'll tell you. better yet, come to a cleansing f

felt both homesick and warmly
at home. no detail of the scene was martian, all was wildly different, yet he grokked correctly that this
was a growing-closer as real as water ceremony, and in numbers and intensity that he had never met
before outside his own nest. he wished forlornly that someone would invite him to join that jumping up

 he spotted miss dawn ardent again in its van and tried to catch her eye-perhaps she would
invite him. he did not have to recognize her-by size and proportions even though he had noted when he
had first seen her that she was exactly as tall as his brother jill with very nearly the same shapings and
masses throughout. but miss dawn ardent had her own face, with her pains and sorrows and growings
graved on it under her warm smile. he wondered if miss dawn ardent might some day be willing to
share water with him and grow clos

er. senator bishop boone had made him feel wary and he was glad
that jubal had not permitted them to sit side by side. but mike was sony when miss dawn ardent had
been sent away.
 miss dawn ardent did not feel him looking at her. the snake dance carried her away.
 the man on the platform had both his arms raised; the great cave became quieter. suddenly he
brought them down. "who's happy?"
 "we're happy!"
 "why?"
 "god... loves us!"
 "how d'you know?"
 "foster told us!"
 he dropped to his knees, raised one clenched fist. "let's hear that lion roar!"
 the congregation roared and shrieked and screamed while he controlled the din using his fist as a
baton, raising the volume, lowering it, sq

oors until we reached a gallery. it
was sort of a loge overlooking the main auditorium. mike was holding forth on the platform. no pulpit,
no altar, just a lecture hall, with a big all-worlds symbol on the wall behind him. there was a robed
priestess on the platform with him and, at that distance, i thought it was jill- but it wasn't; it was another
woman who looks a bit like her and is almost as beautiful. the other high priestess, dawn-dawn
ardent."
 "what was that name?" jubal interrupted.
 "dawn ardent-n√©e higgins, if you want to be fussy."
 "i've met her."

 "i know you have, you allegedly retired goat. she's got a crush on you..."
 jubal shook his head. "some mistake. the 'dawn ardent' i mean i just barely met, about two
years ago. she wouldn't even remember me."
 "she remembers you. she gets every one of your pieces of commercial crud, on tape, under
every pseudonym she has been able to track down. she goes to sle

 jubal said, "did you do that? or ben?"
 "ben did. i don't smoke, unless the man i'm with wants to smoke. but he's always forgetting his
cigarettes; they chase him all over the nest."
 "hmmm ... pretty fair-sized mud pies he makes these days."
 "ben is advancing much more rapidly than he will ever admit. he's a very holy person-but he
hates to admit it. he's shy."
 "umph. dawn, you are the dawn ardent i met at foster tabernacle about two and half years
ago, aren't you?"
 "oh, you remember!!" she looked as if he had handed her a lollipop.
 "of course i remember. but i was slightly puzzled. you've changed some. all for the better. you
seem much more beautiful."

more beautiful, too."
