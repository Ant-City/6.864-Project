Michael Cassio - 
                	Othello's
lieutenant. Cassio is a young and inexperienced soldier, whose high
position is much resented by Iago. Truly devoted to Othello, Cassio
is extremely ashamed after being implicated in a drunken brawl on
Cyprus and losing his place as lieutenant. Iago uses Cassio's youth,
good looks, and friendship with Desdemona to play on Othello's insecurities
about Desdemona's fidelity.
