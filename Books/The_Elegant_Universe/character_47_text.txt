chapters  11  and  13)  an  isolated  "chunk"  of  space  is  collapsing.  the  general  belief  among  string
theorists is that, regardless of shape, there is a minimum limiting size, much as in the case of circular

dimensions, so long as we are shrinking a full spatial dimension. establishing this expectation is an
important goal for further research because it has a direct impact on a number of aspects of string
theory, including its implications for cosmology.

mirror symmetry

through general relativity, einstein forged a link between the physics of gravity and the geometry of
spacetime.  at  first  blush,  string  theory  strengthens  and  broadens  the  link  between  physics  and
geometry, since the properties of vibrating strings—their mass and the force charges they carry—are
largely determined by the properties of the curled-up component of space. we have just seen, though,
that  quantum  geometry—the  geometry-physics  association  in  string  theory—

recisely by the interchange of the number of even and odd holes. i told him that i was still seated—
that plesser and i had found the same result. candelas's and our work turned out to be complementary;
we  had  gone  one  step  further  by  showing  that  all  of  the  resulting  physics  in  a  mirror  pair  was
identical, whereas candelas and his students had shown that a significantly larger sample of calabi-
yau shapes fell into mirror pairs. through the two papers, we had discovered the mirror symmetry
of string theory.7

the physics and the mathematics of mirror symmetry

the loosening of einstein's rigid and unique association between the geometry of space and observed
physics is one of the striking paradigm shifts of string theory. but these developments entail far more
than a change in philosophical stance. mirror symmetry, in particular, provides a powerful tool for
understanding both the physics of string theory and the mathematics of calabi-yau spaces.

in  arild  strømme—happened  to  be  working  on  one  of
numerous calculations that candelas and his collaborators had successfully conquered with mirror
symmetry. roughly speaking, it amounted to calculating the number of spheres that could be "packed"
inside a particular calabi-yau space, somewhat like our analogy of counting oranges in a large bin.
at a meeting of physicists and mathematicians in berkeley in 1991, candelas announced the result
reached by his group using string theory and mirror symmetry: 317,206,375. ellingsrud and strømme
announced  the  result  of  their  very  difficult  mathematical  calculation:  2,682,549,425.  for  days,
mathematicians and physicists debated: who was right? the question turned into a real litmus test of
the quantitative reliability of string theory. a number of people even commented—somewhat in jest—
that  this  test  was  the  next  best  thing  to  being  able  to  compare  string  theory  with  experiment.
moreover, candelas's results went far b

the meeting ended
with a great deal of fruitful exchange between mathematicians and physicists, but no resolution of the
discrepancy.

about  a  month  later,  an  e-mail  message  was  widely  circulated  among  participants  in  the
berkeley meeting with the subject heading physics wins! ellingsrud and strømme had found an error
in their computer code that, when corrected, confirmed candelas's result. since then, there have been
many mathematical checks on the quantitative reliability of the mirror symmetry of string theory: it has
passed all with flying colors. even more recently, almost a decade after physicists discovered mirror
symmetry,  mathematicians  have  made  great  progress  in  revealing  its  inherent  mathematical
foundations.  by  utilizing  substantial  contributions  of  the  mathematicians  maxim  kontsevich,  yuri
manin, gang tian, jun li, and alexander givental, yau and his collaborators bong lian and kefeng
liu have finally found a rigorous mathematical proof of the formulas

member of a mirror pair of calabi-yau shapes (if
selected for the extra dimensions) is identical, but the complexity of the mathematics that a physicist

must employ to extract the physics can differ significantly between the two. aspinwall and lütken
speculated that the mathematically complicated flop transition of figures 11.3 and 11.4 might have a
far  simpler  mirror  description—one  that  might  give  a  more  transparent  view  on  the  associated
physics.

at the time of their work, mirror symmetry was not understood at the depth required to answer
the question they posed. however, aspinwall and lütken noted that there did not seem to be anything
in the mirror description that would indicate a disastrous physical consequence associated with the
spatial tears of flop transitions. around the same time, the work plesser and i had done in finding
mirror  pairs  of  calabi-yau  shapes  (see  chapter  10)  unexpectedly  led  us  to  think  about  flop
transitions  as  well.  it  is  a  well-kn

d, each of us turned to working on other string theory projects.

even  so,  i  found  myself  mulling  over  the  possibility  of  space-tearing  flop  transitions. as  the
months  went  by,  i  felt  increasingly  sure  that  they  had  to  be  part  and  parcel  of  string  theory.  the
preliminary  calculations  plesser  and  i  had  done,  together  with  insightful  discussions  with  david
morrison, a mathematician from duke university, made it seem that this was the only conclusion that
mirror symmetry naturally supported. in fact, during a visit to duke, morrison and i, together with
some helpful observations from sheldon katz of oklahoma state university, who was also visiting
duke at the time, outlined a strategy for proving that flop transitions can occur in string theory. but
when we sat down to do the required calculations, we found that they were extraordinarily intensive.
even on the world's fastest computer, they would take more than a century to complete. we had made
progress,  but

 we  clearly  needed  a  new  idea,  one  that  could  greatly  enhance  the  efficiency  of  our
calculational  method.  unwittingly,  victor  batyrev,  a  mathematician  from  the  university  of  essen,
revealed such an idea through a pair of papers released in the spring and summer of 1992.

batyrev had become very interested in mirror symmetry, especially in the wake of the success of

candelas and his collaborators in using it to solve the sphere-counting problem described at the end
of  chapter  10.  with  a  mathematician's  perspective,  though,  batyrev  was  unsettled  by  the  methods
plesser and i had invoked to find mirror pairs of calabi-yau spaces. although our approach used
tools  familiar  to  string  theorists,  batyrev  later  told  me  that  our  paper  seemed  to  him  to  be  "black
magic." this reflects the large

nt itself. since mirrors interchange left and right, the work of lee, yang, and
wu established that the universe is not perfectly left-right symmetric—in the language of the field, the
universe  is chiral.  it  is  this  feature  of  the  standard  model  (the  weak  force,  in  particular)  that
physicists found nearly impossible to incorporate into a higher-dimensional supergravity framework.
to avoid confusion, we note that in chapter 10 we will discuss a concept in string theory known as
"mirror symmetry," but the use of the word "mirror" in that context is completely different from its use
here.

8.  for  the  mathematically  inclined  reader,  we  note  that  a  calabi-yau  manifold  is  a  complex
kähler  manifold  with  vanishing  first  chern  class.  in  1957  calabi  conjectured  that  every  such
manifold admits a ricci-flat metric, and in 1977 yau proved this to be true.

ven-dimensional holes. the conclusion, however, is the same. for
instance, if two calabi-yau spaces differ by the interchange of their respective h2,1  and h1,1 hodge
numbers, the number of particle families—and the total number of "holes"—will not change.

6. the name comes from the fact that the "hodge diamonds"—a mathematical summary of the
holes of various dimensions in a calabi-yau space—for each calabi-yau space of a mirror pair are
mirror reflections of one another.

7. the term mirror symmetry is also used in other, completely different contexts in physics, such
as in the question of chirality—that is, whether the universe is left-right symmetric—as discussed in
note 7 of chapter 8.

space  is  dynamical—that  is,  whether  it  can  change.  we  note  that  although  we  will  often  use  the

which branes can have an effect on familiar physics. for example, it has been suggested that our three
extended spatial dimensions might themselves be a three-brane that is large and unfurled. if so, as we
go  about  our  daily  business  we  would  be  gliding  through  the  interior  of  a  three-dimensional
membrane. investigations of such possibilities are now being undertaken.

chapter 13

1. the expert reader will recognize that under mirror symmetry, a collapsing three-dimensional
sphere on one calabi-yau space gets mapped to a collapsing two-dimensional sphere on the mirror
calabi-yau space—apparently putting us back in the situation of flops discussed in chapter 11. the
difference, however, is that a mirror rephrasing of this sort results in the antisymmetric tensor field
bµv—the real part of the complexified kähler form on the mirror calabi-yau space—vanishing, and
this is a far more drastic sort of singularity than that discuss
