     that it is an oven, and that it encompasses us, and that
     we are the embers. these men teach, if one give them
     money, to conquer in speaking, right or wrong.

     phid. who are they?

     strep. i do not know the name accurately. they are
     minute philosophers, noble and excellent.

     phid. bah! they are rogues; i know them. you mean the
     quacks, the pale-faced wretches, the bare-footed
     fellows, of whose numbers are the miserable socrates and
     chaerephon.

     strep. hold! hold! be silent! do not say anything
     foolish. but, if you have any concern for your father's
     patrimony, become one of them, having given up your
     horsemanship.

     phid. i would not, by bacchus, even if you were to give
     me the pheasants which leogoras  rears!

     strep. go, i entreat you, dearest of men, go and be
     taught.

     phid. why, what shall i learn?

     strep. they say that among them are both the two

     against the door so very carelessly, and have caused the
     miscarriage of an idea which i had conceived.

     strep. pardon me; for i dwell afar in the country. but
     tell me the thing which has been made to miscarry.

     dis. it is not lawful to mention it, except to
     disciples.

     strep. tell it, then, to me without fear; for i here am
     come as a disciple to the thinking-shop.

     dis. i will tell you; but you must regard these as
     mysteries. socrates lately asked chaerephon  about a
     flea, how many of its own feet it jumped; for after
     having bit the eyebrow of chaerephon, it leaped away
     onto the head of socrates.

     strep. how then did he measure this?

     dis. most cleverly. he melted some wax; and then took
     the flea and dipped its feet in the wax; and then a pair
     of persian slippers stuck to it when cooled. having
     gently loosened these, he measured back the distance.

     strep. o king jupiter! what subt

lety of thought!

     dis. what then would you say if you heard another
     contrivance of socrates?

     strep. of what kind? tell me, i beseech you!

     dis. chaerephon the sphettian asked him whether he
     thought gnats buzzed through the mouth or the breech.

     strep. what, then, did he say about the gnat?

     dis. he said the intestine of the gnat was narrow and
     that the wind went forcibly through it, being slender,
     straight to the breech; and then that the rump, being
     hollow where it is adjacent to the narrow part,
     resounded through the violence of the wind

et! oh,
     thrice happy he for his sharp-sightedness! surely a
     defendant might easily get acquitted who understands the
     intestine of the gnat.

     dis. but he was lately deprived of a great idea by a
     lizard.

     strep. in what way? tell me.

     dis. as he was investigating the courses of the moon and
     her revolutions, then as he was gaping upward a lizard
     in the darkness dropped upon him from the roof.

     strep. i am amused at a lizard's having dropped on
     socrates.

     dis. yesterday evening there was no supper for us.

     strep. well. what then did he contrive for provisions?

     dis. he sprinkled fine ashes on the table, and bent a
     little spit, and then took it as a pair of compasses and
     filched a cloak from the palaestra.

     strep. why then do we admire thales?  open open quickly
     the thinking-shop, and show to me socrates as quickly as
     possible. for i desire to be a disciple. come, open the
     door.

     air in a basket.]

     o hercules, from what country are these wild beasts?

     dis. what do you wonder at? to what do they seem to you
     to be like?

     strep. to the spartans who were taken at pylos.  but why
     in the world do these look upon the ground?

     dis. they are in search of the things below the earth.

     strep. then they are searching for roots. do not, then,
     trouble yourselves about this; for i know where there
     are la

smen of cicynna?

     dis. here they are. and euboea here, as you see, is
     stretched out a long way by the side of it to a great
     distance.

     strep. i know that; for it was stretched by us and
     pericles.  but where is lacedaemon?

     dis. where is it? here it is.

     strep. how near it is to us! pay great attention to
     this, to remove it very far from us.

     dis. by jupiter, it is not possible.

     strep. then you will weep for it.

     [looking up and discovering socrates.]

     come, who is this man who is in the basket?

     dis. himself.

     strep. who's "himself"?

     dis. socrates.

     strep. o socrates! come, you sir, call upon him loudly
     for me.

     dis. nay, rather, call him yourself; for i have no
     leisure.

     [exit disciple.]

     strep. socrates! my little socrates!

     socrates. why callest thou me, thou creature of a day?

     strep. first tell me, i beseech you, what are you doing.

     soc. i am walking in the air, and s

     celestial if i had not suspended the intellect, and
     mixed the thought in a subtle form with its kindred air.
     but if, being on the ground, i speculated from below on
     things above, i should never have discovered them. for
     the earth forcibly attracts to itself the meditative
     moisture. water-cresses also suffer the very same thing.

     strep. what do you say? does meditation attract the
     moisture to the water-cresses? come then, my little
     socrates, descend to me, that you may teach me those
     things, for the sake of which i have come.

     [socrates lowers himself and gets out of the basket.]

     soc. and for what did you come?

     strep. wishing to learn to speak; for by reason of
     usury, and most ill-natured creditors, i am pillaged and
     plundered, and have my goods seized for debt.

     soc. how did you get in debt without observing it?

     strep. a horse-disease consumed me--terrible at eating.
     but teach me th

     soc. do you wish to know clearly celestial matters, what
     they rightly are?

     strep. yes, by jupiter, if it be possible!

     soc. and to hold converse with the clouds, our
     divinities?

     strep. by all means.

     soc. (with great solemnity). seat yourself, then, upon
     the sacred couch.

     strep. well, i am seated!

     soc. take, then, this chaplet.

     strep. for what purpose a chaplet? ah me! socrates, see
     that you do not sacrifice me like athamas!

     strep. no; we do all these to those who get initiated.

     strep. then what shall i gain, pray?

     soc. you shall become in oratory a tricky knave, a
     thorough rattle, a subtle speaker. but keep quiet.

     strep. by jupiter! you will not deceive me; for if i am
     besprinkled, i shall become fine flour.

     soc. it becomes the old man to speak words of good omen,
     and to hearken to my prayer. o sovereign king,

     the loud-sounding music of flutes.

     strep. tell me, o socrates, i beseech you, by jupiter,
     who are these that have uttered this grand song? are
     they some heroines?

     to idle men; who supply us with thought and argument,
     and intelligence and humbug, and circumlocution, and
     ability to hoax, and comprehension.

     strep. on this account therefore my soul, having heard
     their voice, flutters, and already seeks to discourse
     subtilely, and to quibble about smoke, and

     strep. what shall i experience?

     cho. you shall pass with me the most enviable of mortal
     lives the whole time.

     strep. shall i then ever see this?

     cho. yea, so that many be always seated at your gates,
     wishing to communicate with you and come to a conference
     with you, to consult with you as to actions and
     affidavits of many talents, as is worthy of your
     abilities.

     [to socrates.]

     but attempt to teach the old man by degrees whatever you
     purpose, and scrutinize his intellect, and make trial of
     his mind.

     soc. come now, tell me your own turn of mind; in order
     that, when i know of what sort it is, i may now, after
     this, apply to you new engines.

     strep. what? by the gods, do you purpose to besiege me?

     soc. no; i wish to briefly learn from you if you are
     possessed of a good memory.

     soc. don't chatter; but quickly follow me hither with
     smartness.

     strep. then give me first into my hands a honeyed cake;
     for i am afraid of descending within, as if into the
     cave of trophonius.

     soc. proceed; why do you keep poking about the door?

     [exeunt socrates and strepsiades]

     cho. well, go in peace, for the sake of this your
     valour. may prosperity attend the man, because, being
     advanced into the vale of years, he imbues his intellect
     with modern subjects, and cultivates wisdom!

     sacrificing, you are inflicting tortures and litigating.
     and often, while we gods are observing a fast, when we
     mourn for memnon or sarpedon,  you are pouring libations
     and laughing. for which reason hyperbolus, having
     obtained the lot this year to be hieromnemon,  was
     afterward deprived by us gods of his crown; for thus he
     will know better that he ought to spend the days of his
     life according to the moon.

     soc. by respiration, and chaos, and air, i have not seen
     any man so boorish, nor so impracticable, nor so stupid,
     nor so forgetful; who, while learning some little petty
     quibbles, forgets them before he has learned them.
     nevertheless i will certainly call him out here to the
     light. where is strepsiades? come forth with your couch.

     soc. it is no use, by jupiter! having reclined yourself
     down here--

     strep. what must i do?

     soc. think out some of your own affairs.

     strep. not here, pray, i beseech you; but, if i must,
     suffer me to excogitate these very things on the ground.

     soc. there is no other way.

     strep. unfortunate man that i am! what a penalty shall i
     this day pay to the bugs!

     cho. now meditate and examine closely; and roll yourself
     about in every way, having wrapped yourself up; and
     quickly, when you fall into a difficulty, spring to
     another mental contrivance. but let delightful sleep be
     absent from your eyes.

     cho. do not now be very grievously distressed.

     strep. why, how, when my money is gone, my complexion
     gone, my life gone, and my slipper gone? and furthermore
     in addition to these evils, with singing the
     night-watches, i am almost gone myself.

     soc. ho you! what are you about? are you not meditating?

     strep. i? yea, by neptune!

     soc. and what, pray, have you thought?

     strep. whether any bit of me will be left by the bugs.

     soc. you will perish most wretchedly.

     strep. but, my good friend, i have already perished.

     strep. no; by jupiter, certainly not!

     strep. about what? for do you tell me this, o socrates!

     soc. do you, yourself, first find out and state what you
     wish.

     strep. you have heard a thousand times what i wish.
     about the interest; so that i may pay no one.

     then shut it up, as if it were a mirror, in a round

     willing to learn. what must i do?

     cho. but do you permit him?

     strep. yes, for he is robust in body, and in good
     health, and is come of the high-plumed dames of coesyra.
     i will go for him, and if he be not willing, i will
     certainly drive him from my house.

     strep. then i will shout with a very loud shout: ho!
     weep, you petty-usurers, both you and your principals,
     and your compound interests! for you can no longer do me
     any harm, because such a son is being reared for me in
     this house, shining with a double-edged tongue, for my
     guardian, the preserver of my house, a mischief to my
     enemies, ending the sadness of the great woes of his
     father. him do thou run and summon from within to me.

     [socrates goes into the house.]

     o child! o son! come forth from the house! hear your
     father!

     [re-enter socrates leading in phidippides]

     soc. lo, here is the man!

     strep. o my dear, my dear!

     soc. take your son and depart.

     [exit socrates.]

     strep. oh, oh, my child! huzza! huzza! how i am
     delighted at the first sight of your complexion! now,
     indeed, you are, in the first place, negative and
     disputatious to look at, and this fashion native to the

ny blows as
     we received before the law was made, we remit: and we
     concede to them our having been thrashed without return.
     observe the cocks and these other animals, how they
     punish their fathers; and yet, in what do they differ
     from us, except that they do not write decrees?

     strep. why then, since you imitate the cocks in all
     things, do you not both eat dung and sleep on a perch?

     phid. it is not the same thing, my friend; nor would it
     appear so to socrates.

     strep. therefore do not beat me; otherwise you will one
     day blame yourself.

     phid. why, how?

     strep. since i am justly entitled to chastise you; and
     you to chastise your son, if you should have one.

     phid. but if i should not have one, i shall have wept
     for nothing, and you will die laughing at me.

     strep. to me, indeed, o comrades, he seems to speak
     justly; and i think we ought to concede to them what is
     fitting. for it is proper that we shou

 how, pray? for inform me what good you will do me
     by this.

     phid. i will beat my mother, just as i have you.

     strep. what do you say? what do you say? this other,
     again, is a greater wickedness.

     phid. but what if, having the worst cause, i shall
     conquer you in arguing, proving that it is right to beat
     one's mother?

     strep. most assuredly, if you do this, nothing will
     hinder you from casting yourself and your worse cause
     into the pit along with socrates. these evils have i
     suffered through you, o clouds! having intrusted all my
     affairs to you.

     cho. nay, rather, you are yourself  the cause of these
     things, having turned yourself to wicked courses.

     strep. why, pray, did you not tell me this, then, but
     excited with hopes a rustic and aged man?

     cho. we always do this to him whom we perceive to be a
     lover of wicked courses, until we precipitate him into
     misfortune, so that he may learn to fear the god

s.

     strep. ah me! it is severe, o clouds! but it is just;
     for i ought not to have withheld the money which i
     borrowed. now, therefore, come with me, my dearest son,
     that you may destroy the blackguard chaerephon and
     socrates, who deceived you and me.

     phid. i will not injure my teachers.

     strep. yes, yes, reverence paternal jove.

     phid. "paternal jove" quoth'a! how antiquated you are!
     why, is there any jove?

     strep. there is.

     phid. there is not, no; for vortex reigns having
     expelled jupiter.

     strep. he has not expelled him; but i fancied this, on
     account of this vortex here. ah me, unhappy man! when i
     even took you who are of earthenware for a god.

     strep. ah me, what madness! how mad, then, i was when i
     ejected the gods on account of socrates! but o dear
     hermes, by no means be wroth with me, nor destroy me;
     but pardon me, since i have gone crazy through prating.
     and become my adviser, whether i shall bring an action
     and prosecute them, or whatever you think. you advise me
     rightly, not permitting me to get up a lawsuit, but as
     soon as possible to set fire to the house of the prating
     fellows. come hither, come hither, xanthias! come forth
     with a ladder and with a mattock and then mount upon the
