when he was stirred to seek the court of cupid he
was "at eighteen year of age." according to leland, however,
he was educated at oxford, proceeding thence to france and
the netherlands, to finish his studies; but there remains no
certain evidence of his having belonged to either university. at
the same time, it is not doubted that his family was of good
condition; and, whether or not we accept the assertion that his
father held the rank of knighthood -- rejecting the hypotheses
that make him a merchant, or a vintner "at the corner of kirton
lane" -- it is plain, from chaucer's whole career, that he had
introductions to public life, and recommendations to courtly
favour, wholly independent of his genius. we have the clearest
testimony that his mental training was of wide range and
thorough excellence, altogether rare for a mere courtier in those
days: his poems attest his intimate acquaintance with the
divinity, the philosophy, and the scholarship of his time, and
show him to have had the scie

none other message would they thither send,
but come themselves to rome, this is the end:
and in such place as thought them a vantage

sojourned have these merchants in that town
a certain time as fell to their pleasance:
and so befell, that th' excellent renown

notes to the prologue to the wife of bath's tale


1. among the evidences that chaucer's great work was left
incomplete, is the absence of any link of connexion between the
wife of bath's prologue and tale, and what goes before. this
deficiency has in some editions caused the squire's and the
merchant's tales to be interposed between those of the man of
law and the wife of bath; but in the merchant's tale there is
internal proof that it was told after the jolly dame's.  several
manuscripts contain verses designed to serve as a connexion;
but they are evidently not chaucer's, and it is unnecessary to
give them here. of this prologue, which may fairly be regarded
as a distinct autobiographical tale, tyrwhitt says: "the
extraordinary length of it, as well as the vein of pleasantry that
runs thr

16. chichevache, in old popular fable, was a monster that fed
only on good women, and was always very thin from scarcity of
such food; a corresponding monster, bycorne, fed only on
obedient and kind husbands, and was always fat. the origin of
the fable was french; but lydgate has a ballad on the subject.
"chichevache" literally means "niggardly" or "greedy cow."

"weeping and wailing, care and other sorrow,
i have enough, on even and on morrow,"
quoth the merchant, "and so have other mo',
that wedded be; i trow* that it be so;                          *believe
for well i wot it fareth so by me.
i have a wife, the worste that may be,
for though the fiend to her y-coupled were,
she would him overmatch, i dare well swear.

and yet i trow* that he that all his life                       *believe

could tellen of my wife's cursedness."*                      *wickedness

"now," quoth our host, "merchant, so god you bless,
since ye so muche knowen of that art,
full heartily i pray you tell us part."
"gladly," quoth he; "but of mine owen sore,
for sorry heart, i telle may no more."


notes to the prologue to the merchant's tale


1.  though the manner in which the merchant takes up the
closing words of the envoy to the clerk's tale, and refers to
the patience of griselda, seems to prove beyond doubt that
the order of the tales in the text is the right one, yet in
some manuscripts of good authori

fe at home had heard this legend once;
this is a gentle tale for the nonce;
as, to my purpose, wiste ye my will.
but thing that will not be, let it be still.'"

in other manuscripts of less authority the host proceeds, in
two similar stanzas, to impose a tale on the franklin; but
tyrwhitt is probably right in setting them aside as spurious,
and in admitting the genuineness of the first only, if it be
supposed that chaucer forgot to cancel it when he had
decided on another mode of connecting the merchant's with
the clerk's tale.

whilom there was dwelling in lombardy
a worthy knight, that born was at pavie,
in which he liv'd in great prosperity;
and forty years a wifeless man was he,
and follow'd aye his bodily delight
on women, where as was his appetite,
as do these fooles that be seculeres.<2>
and, when that he was passed sixty years,
were it for holiness, or for dotage,

and with that word she leapt down from the tree.
this january, who is glad but he?
he kissed her, and clipped* her full oft,                      *embraced
and on her womb he stroked her full soft;
and to his palace home he hath her lad.*                            *led
now, goode men, i pray you to be glad.
thus endeth here my tale of january,
god bless us, and his mother, sainte mary.


notes to the merchant's tale


1. if, as is probable, this tale was translated from the french,
the original is not now extant. tyrwhitt remarks that the scene
"is laid in italy, but none of the names, except damian and
justin, seem to be italian,  but rather made at pleasure; so that i
doubt whether the story be really of italian growth. the
adventure of the pear-tree i find in a small collection of latin
fables, written by one adoiphus, in elegiac verses of his fashion,

notes to the prologue to the franklin's tale


1. in the older editions, the verses here given as the prologue
were prefixed to the merchant's tale, and put into his mouth.
tyrwhitt was abundantly justified, by the internal evidence
afforded by the lines themselves, in transferring them to their
present place.

2. the "breton lays" were an important and curious element in
the literature of the middle ages; they were originally
composed in the armorican language, and the chief collection
of them extant was translated into french verse by a poetess
calling herself "marie," about the middle of the thirteenth
century.  but though this c

 were the tares among the lord's wheat; so, a few lines
below, the shipman intimates his fear lest the parson should
"spring cockle in our clean corn."

3. cockle: a weed, the "agrostemma githago" of linnaeus;
perhaps named from the anglo-saxon, "ceocan," because it
chokes the corn.
(transcriber's note: it is also possible chaucer had in mind
matthew 13:25, where in some translations, an enemy sowed
"cockle" amongst the wheat. (other translations have "tares"
and "darnel".))


the tale. <1>


a merchant whilom dwell'd at saint denise,
that riche was, for which men held him wise.
a wife he had of excellent beauty,
and *companiable and revellous* was she,            *fond of society and
which is a thing that causeth more dispence                merry making*
than worth is all the cheer and reverence
that men them do at feastes and at dances.

in which array we dance jollily.
and if that he may not, paraventure,
or elles list not such dispence endure,
but thinketh it is wasted and y-lost,
then must another paye for our cost,
or lend us gold, and that is perilous.

this noble merchant held a noble house;
for which he had all day so great repair,*           *resort of visitors
for his largesse, and for his wife was fair,
that wonder is; but hearken to my tale.
amonges all these guestes great and smale,
there was a monk, a fair man and a bold,
i trow a thirty winter he was old,
that ever-in-one* was drawing to that place.                 *constantly

and bade the meinie* "farewell; have good day."                *servants
for none of them, nor no wight in the town,
had of dan john right no suspicioun;
and forth he rode home to his abbay,
or where him list; no more of him i say.

the merchant, when that ended was the fair,
to saint denis he gan for to repair,
and with his wife he made feast and cheer,
and tolde her that chaffare* was so dear,                   *merchandise
that needes must he make a chevisance;*                       *loan <11>
for he was bound in a recognisance
to paye twenty thousand shields* anon.                     *crowns, ecus
for which this merchant is to paris gone,
to borrow of certain friendes that he had
a certain francs, and some with him he lad.*

d shields should ye not miss,
for ye so kindely the other day
lente me gold, and as i can and may
i thanke you, by god and by saint jame.
but natheless i took unto our dame,
your wife at home, the same gold again,
upon your bench; she wot it well, certain,
by certain tokens that i can her tell
now, by your leave, i may no longer dwell;
our abbot will out of this town anon,
and in his company i muste gon.
greet well our dame, mine owen niece sweet,
and farewell, deare cousin, till we meet.

this merchant, which that was full ware and wise,
*creanced hath,* and paid eke in paris             *had obtained credit*
to certain lombards ready in their hond
the sum of gold, and got of them his bond,
and home he went, merry as a popinjay.*                          *parrot
for well he knew he stood in such array
that needes must he win in that voyage
a thousand francs, above all his costage.*                     *expenses

as she was wont of old usage algate*

for he was rich, and clearly out of debt.
when it was day, the merchant gan embrace
his wife all new, and kiss'd her in her face,
and up he went, and maked it full tough.

"no more," quoth she, "by god ye have enough;"
and wantonly again with him she play'd,
till at the last this merchant to her said.
"by god," quoth he, "i am a little wroth
with you, my wife, although it be me loth;
and wot ye why? by god, as that i guess,
that ye have made a *manner strangeness*        *a kind of estrangement*
betwixte me and my cousin, dan john.
ye should have warned me, ere i had gone,
that he you had a hundred frankes paid
by ready token; he *had him evil apaid*                 *was displeased*

 and if so be i fail,
i am your wife, score it upon my tail,
and i shall pay as soon as ever i may.
for, by my troth, i have on mine array,
and not in waste, bestow'd it every deal.
and, for i have bestowed it so well,
for your honour, for godde's sake i say,
as be not wroth, but let us laugh and play.
ye shall my jolly body have *to wed;*                        *in pledge*
by god, i will not pay you but in bed;
forgive it me, mine owen spouse dear;
turn hitherward, and make better cheer."

the merchant saw none other remedy;
and for to chide, it were but a folly,
since that the thing might not amended be.
"now, wife," he said, "and i forgive it thee;
but by thy life be no more so large;*                   *liberal, lavish
keep better my good, this give i thee in charge."
thus endeth now my tale; and god us send
taling enough, until our lives' end!

and in some passages, especially where husband and wife debate
the merits or demerits of women, and where prudence dilates
on the evils of poverty, chaucer only reproduces much that had
been said already in the tales that preceded -- such as the
merchant's and the man of law's.
