racks, taxes on the land, and to buy
water and wood and food, everyone must work. so, we teach the young ones, babysit the babies, look after the old and
sick, and attend birthing mothers. our days are fuller than ever, our sojourn in england already a dream. but all things
look brighter because i have a loving soul to share them with.


your sister, nettie

well, i say, anything coming from him, i don't want it.

i hear daisy suck in her breath. how about your sister nettie, she say. you think she feel the same way?

him.

she say, celie, the old house you remember was torn down so alphonso could build this one. he got an atlanta architect
to design it, and these tiles come all the way from new york. we was standing in the kitchen at the time. but he put tiles
everywhere. kitchen, toilet, back porch. all around the fireplaces in back and front parlour. but this the house go with the

of defense. it's a big war. so much going on. one ship lost feel like nothing, i guess. plus, colored don't count to those
people.

well, they just don't know, and never did. never will. and so what? i know you on your way home and you may not git
here till i'm ninety, but one of these days i do expect to see your face.

buy anyhow, well, she might exchange a few pleasant words with you. plus, she scare that white man. anybody else
colored he try to call 'em auntie or something. first time he try that with sofia she ast
