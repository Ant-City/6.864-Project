[CHARACTER] - 
                the
cart-horse whose incredible strength, dedication, and loyalty play
a key role in the early prosperity of animal farm and the later
completion of the windmill. quick to help but rather slow-witted,
[CHARACTER] shows much devotion to animal farm's ideals but little ability to
think about them independently. he naively trusts the pigs to make
all his decisions for him. his two mottoes are "i will work harder"
and "napoleon is always right."
