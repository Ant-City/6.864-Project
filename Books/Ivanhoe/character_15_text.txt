 johnâ€™s kirk;--but what, in the
name of ten devils,â€ continued he, turning to the cupbearer, and raising
his voice as if happy to have found a channel into which he might divert
his indignation without fear or control--â€œwhat, in the name of ten
devils, keeps gurth so long afield? i suppose we shall have an evil
account of the herd; he was wont to be a faithful and cautious drudge,
and i had destined him for something better; perchance i might even have
made him one of my warders.â€ [11]

oswald the cupbearer modestly suggested, â€œthat it was scarce an hour
since the tolling of the curfew;â€ an ill-chosen apology, since it turned
upon a topic so harsh to saxon ears.

â€œthe foul fiend,â€ exclaimed cedric, â€œtake the curfew-bell, and the
tyrannical bastard by whom it was devised, and the heartless slave who
names it with a saxon tongue to a saxon ear! the curfew!â€ he added,
pausing, â€œay, the curfew; which compels true men to extinguish their
lights, that thieves and robbers may

that my property has been swept off to save from starving the hungry
banditti, whom they cannot support but by theft and robbery. my faithful
slave is murdered, and my goods are taken for a prey--and wamba--where
is wamba? said not some one he had gone forth with gurth?â€

oswald replied in the affirmative.

â€œay? why this is better and better! he is carried off too, the saxon
fool, to serve the norman lord. fools are we all indeed that serve them,
and fitter subjects for their scorn and laughter, than if we were born
with but half our wits. but i will be avenged,â€ he added, starting from
his chair in impatience at the supposed injury, and catching hold of his
boar-spear; â€œi will go with my complaint to the great council; i have

them, hundebert, that cedric would himself bid them welcome, but he is
under a vow never to step more than three steps from the dais of his own
hall to meet any who shares not the blood of saxon royalty. begone! see
them carefully tended; let them not say in their pride, the saxon churl
has shown at once his poverty and his avarice.â€

the major-domo departed with several attendants, to execute his masterâ€™s
commands.

â€œthe prior aymer!â€ repeated cedric, looking to oswald, â€œthe brother, if
i mistake not, of giles de mauleverer, now lord of middleham?â€

oswald made a respectful sign of assent. â€œhis brother sits in the
seat, and usurps the patrimony, of a better race, the race of ulfgar of
middleham; but what norman lord doth not the same? this prior is, they
say, a free and jovial priest, who loves the wine-cup and the bugle-horn
better than bell and book: good; let him come, he shall be welcome. how
named ye the templar?â€

and which resembled a man who talks to himself rather than to those
around him--â€œbois-guilbert? that name has been spread wide both for
good and evil. they say he is valiant as the bravest of his order;
but stained with their usual vices, pride, arrogance, cruelty, and
voluptuousness; a hard-hearted man, who knows neither fear of earth,
nor awe of heaven. so say the few warriors who have returned from
palestine.--well; it is but for one night; he shall be welcome

odoriferous pigments, upon the board; fill the largest horns [13]

readiness, â€œfor she is ever desirous to hear the lat

conversation was here interrupted by the entrance of the porterâ€™s
page, who announced that there was a stranger at the gate, imploring
admittance and hospitality.

â€œadmit him,â€ said cedric, â€œbe he who or what he may;--a night like that
which roars without, compels even wild animals to herd with tame, and to
seek the protection of man, their mortal foe, rather than perish by
the elements. let his wants be ministered to with all care--look to it,
oswald.â€

and the steward left the banqueting hall to see the commands of his
patron obeyed.

â€œand where sleeps gurth the swineherd?â€ said the stranger.

â€œgurth,â€ replied the bondsman, â€œsleeps in the cell on your right, as the
jew on that to your left; you serve to keep the child of circumcision
separate from the abomination of his tribe. you might have occupied a
more honourable place had you accepted of oswaldâ€™s invitation.â€

â€œit is as well as it is,â€ said the palmer; â€œthe company, even of a jew,
can hardly spread contamination through an oaken partition.â€

so saying, he entered the cabin allotted to him, and taking the torch
from the domesticâ€™s hand, thanked him, and wished him good-night. having
shut the door of his cell, he placed the torch in a candlestick made of
wood, and looked around his sleeping apartment, the furniture of which
was of the most simple kind. it consisted of a ru

when cedric the saxon saw his son drop down senseless in the lists at
ashby, his first impulse was to order him into the custody and care of
his own attendants, but the words choked in his throat. he could not
bring himself to acknowledge, in presence of such an assembly, the son
whom he had renounced and disinherited. he ordered, however, oswald to
keep an eye upon him; and directed that officer, with two of his serfs,
to convey ivanhoe to ashby as soon as the crowd had dispersed. oswald,
however, was anticipated in this good office. the crowd dispersed,
indeed, but the knight was nowhere to be seen.

it was in vain that cedricâ€™s cupbearer looked around for his young
master--he saw the bloody spot on which he had lately sunk down, but
himself he saw no longer; it seemed as if the fairies had conveyed him
from the spot. perhaps oswald

 (for the saxons were very superstitious)
might have adopted some such hypothesis, to account for ivanhoeâ€™s
disappearance, had he not suddenly cast his eye upon a person attired
like a squire, in whom he recognised the features of his fellow-servant
gurth. anxious concerning his masterâ€™s fate, and in despair at his
sudden disappearance, the translated swineherd was searching for him
everywhere, and had neglected, in doing so, the concealment on which
his own safety depended. oswald deemed it his duty to secure gurth, as a
fugitive of whose fate his master was to judge.

renewing his enquiries concerning the fate of ivanhoe, the only
information which the cupbearer could collect from the bystanders
was, that the knight had been raised with care by certain well-attired
grooms, and placed in a litter belonging to a lady among the spectators,
which had immediately transported him out of the press. oswald, on
receiving this intelligence, resolved to return to his master for

gly to the banquet, of which we have already mentioned
the principal events. immediately upon retiring from the castle, the
saxon thanes, with their attendants, took horse; and it was during the
bustle which attended their doing so, that cedric, for the first time,
cast his eyes upon the deserter gurth. the noble saxon had returned from
the banquet, as we have seen, in no very placid humour, and wanted but a
pretext for wreaking his anger upon some one.

â€œthe gyves!â€ he said, â€œthe gyves!--oswald--hundibert!--dogs and
villains!--why leave ye the knave unfettered?â€

without daring to remonstrate, the companions of gurth bound him with
a halter, as the readiest cord which occurred. he submitted to the
operation without remonstrance, except that, darting a reproachful
look at his master, he said, â€œthis comes of loving your flesh and blood
better than mine own.â€

â€œto horse, and forward!â€ said cedric.

â€œit is indeed full time,â€ said the noble athelstane; â€œfor, if we

œwamba!â€ and, at the same time, a dog, which he
recognised to be fangs, jumped up and fawned upon him. â€œgurth!â€ answered
wamba, with the same caution, and the swineherd immediately stood before
him.

â€œwhat is the matter?â€ said he eagerly; â€œwhat mean these cries, and that
clashing of swords?â€

â€œonly a trick of the times,â€ said wamba; â€œthey are all prisoners.â€

â€œwho are prisoners?â€ exclaimed gurth, impatiently.

â€œmy lord, and my lady, and athelstane, and hundibert, and oswald.â€

â€œin the name of god!â€ said gurth, â€œhow came they prisoners?--and to
whom?â€

â€œour master was too ready to fight,â€ said the jester; â€œand athelstane
was not ready enough, and no other person was ready at all. and they are
prisoners to green cassocks, and black visors. and they lie all tumbled
about on the green, like the crab-apples that you shake down to your
swine. and i would laugh at it,â€ said the honest jester, â€œif i could for

â€œbe it so, kind maiden,â€ said ivanhoe; â€œi were most ungrateful to
dispute thy commands. but one word of the fate of poor gurth, and i have
done with questioning thee.â€

â€œi grieve to tell thee, sir knight,â€ answered the jewess, â€œthat he is in
custody by the order of cedric.â€--and then observing the distress which
her communication gave to wilfred, she instantly added, â€œbut the steward
oswald said, that if nothing occurred to renew his masterâ€™s displeasure
against him, he was sure that cedric would pardon gurth, a faithful
serf, and one who stood high in favour, and who had but committed
this error out of the love which he bore to cedricâ€™s son. and he said,
moreover, that he and his comrades, and especially wamba the jester,
were resolved to warn gurth to make his escape by the way, in case
cedricâ€™s ire against him could not be mitigated.â€
