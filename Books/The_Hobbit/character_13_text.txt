 towards the red light, i don't suppose 
even a weasel would have stirred a whisker at it. so, naturally, he got right up to the fire-
for fire it was without disturbing anyone. and this is what he saw. three very large 
persons sitting round a very large fire of beech-logs. 
they were toasting mutton on long spits of wood, and licking the gravy off their fingers. 
there was a fine toothsome smell. also there was a barrel of good drink at hand, and 
they were drinking out of jugs. but they were trolls. 
obviously trolls. even bilbo, in spite of his sheltered life, could see that: from the great 
heavy faces of them, and their size, and the shape of their legs, not to mention their 
language, which was not drawing-room fashion at all, at all. 
"mutton yesterday, mutton today, and blimey, if it don't look like mutton again tomorrow," 
said one of the trolls. 
"never a blinking bit of manflesh have we had for long enough," said a second. "what

william choked. "shut yer mouth!" he said as soon as he could. "yer can't expect folk to 
stop here for ever just to be et by you and bert. you've et a village and a half between 
yer, since we come down from the mountains. how much more d'yer want? and time's 
been up our way, when yer'd have said 'thank yer bill' for a nice bit o' fat valley mutton 
like what this is." he took a big bite off a sheep's leg he was toasting, and wiped his lips 
on his sleeve. 
yes, i am afraid trolls do behave like that, even those with only one head each. after 
hearing all this bilbo ought to have done something at once. 
either he should have gone back quietly and warned his friends that there were three 
fair-sized trolls at hand in a nasty mood, quite likely to try toasted dwarf, or even pony, 
for a change; or else he should have done a bit of good quick burgling. a really first-
class and legendary burglar would at this point have picked the trolls' pockets-it is nearly 
always worth

 pride would perhaps have stuck a dagger into each of them before they 
observed it. then the night could have been spent cheerily. 
bilbo knew it. he had read of a good many things he had never seen or done. he was 
very much alarmed, as well as disgusted; he wished himself a hundred miles away, and 
yet-and yet somehow he could not go straight back to thorin and company empty-
handed. so he stood and hesitated in the shadows. of the various burglarious 
proceedings he had heard of picking the trolls' pockets seemed the least difficult, so at 
last he crept behind a tree just behind william. 
bert and tom went off to the barrel. william was having another drink. 
then bilbo plucked up courage and put his little hand in william's enormous pocket. 
there was a purse in it, as big as a bag to bilbo. "ha!" thought he warming to his new 
work as he lifted it carefully out, "this is a beginning!" 
it was! trolls' purses are the mischief, and this was no exception. " 
'ere, 'oo are you?" it squeak

ed, as it left the pocket; and william turned round at once 
and grabbed bilbo by the neck, before he could duck behind the tree. 
"blimey, bert, look what i've copped!" said william. 
"what is it?" said the others coming up. 
"lumme, if i knows! what are yer?" 
"bilbo baggins, a bur- a hobbit," said poor bilbo, shaking all over, and wondering how to 
make owl-noises before they throttled him. 

"a burrahobbit?" said they a bit startled. trolls are slow in the uptake, and mighty 
suspicious about anything new to them. 
"what's a burrahobbit got to do with my pocket, anyways?" said william. 
"and can yer cook 'em?" said tom. 
"yer can try," said bert, picking up a skewer. 
"he wouldn't make above a mouthful," said william, who had already had a fine supper, 
"not when he was skinned and boned." 
"p'raps there are more like him round about, and we might make a pie," said bert. "here 
you, are there any more of your sort a-sneakin' in th

bert's big paw, and he had no breath in his body, and his head was going round; so 
there he lay for a while panting, just outside the circle of firelight. 
right in the middle of the fight up came balin. the dwarves had heard noises from a 
distance, and after wait-ing for some time for bilbo to come back, or to hoot like an owl, 
they started off one by one to creep towards the light as quietly as they could. no sooner 
did tom see balin come into the light than he gave an awful howl. trolls simply detest 
the very sight of dwarves (uncooked). bert and bill stopped fighting immediately, and "a 
sack, tom, quick!" they said, before balin, who was wondering where in all this 
commotion bilbo was, knew what was happening, a sack was over his head, and he was 
down. 
"there's more to come yet," said tom, "or i'm mighty mistook. lots and none at all, it is," 
said he. "no burra- hobbits, but lots of these here dwarves. that's about the shape of it!" 
"i reckon you're right," said bert,

and bombur piled uncomfortably near the fire. 
"that'll teach 'em," said tom; for bifur and bombur had given a lot of trouble, and fought 
like mad, as dwarves will when cornered. 
thorin came last-and he was not caught unawares. he came expecting mischief, and 
didn't need to see his friends' legs sticking out of sacks to tell him that things were not all 
well. he stood outside in the shadows some way off, and said: "what's all this trouble? 
who has been knocking my people about?" 
"it's trolls!" said bilbo from behind a tree. they had forgotten all about him. "they're 
hiding in the bushes with sacks," said he. 
"o! are they?" said thorin, and he jumped forward to the fire, before they could leap on 
him. he caught up a big branch all on fire at one end; and bert got that end in his eye 
before he could step aside. that put him out of the battle for a bit. bilbo did his best. he 
caught hold of tom's leg-as well as he could, it was thick as a young tree-trunk -but he 
was sent spinni

thorin's face. 
tom got the branch in his teeth for that, and lost one of the front ones. 
it made him howl, i can tell you. but just at that moment william came up behind and 
popped a sack right over thorin's head and down to his toes. and so the fight ended. a 
nice pickle they were all in now: all neatly tied up in sacks, with three angry trolls (and 
two with burns and bashes to remember) sitting by them, arguing whether they should 
roast them slowly, or mince them fine and boil them, or just sit on them one by one and 
squash them into jelly: and bilbo up in a bush, with his clothes and his skin torn, not 
daring to move for fear they should hear him. 
it was just then that gandalf came back. but no one saw him. the trolls had just decided 
to roast the dwarves now and eat them later-that was bert's idea, and after a lot of

 bert together. "the night's gettin' on, and dawn comes early. 
let's get on with it!" 
"dawn take you all, and be stone to you!" said a voice that sounded like william's. but it 
wasn't. for just at that moment the light came over the hill, and there was a mighty 
twitter in the branches. william never spoke for he stood turned to stone as he stooped; 
and bert and tom were stuck like rocks as they looked at him. and there they stand to 
this day, all alone, unless the birds perch on them; for trolls, as you probably know, must 
be underground before dawn, or they go back to the stuff of the mountains they are 
made of, and never move again. that is what had happened to bert and tom and 
william. 
"excellent!" said gandalf, as he stepped from behind a tree, and helped bilbo to climb 
down out of a thorn-bush. then bilbo understood. it was the wizard's voice that had kept 
the trolls bickering and quarrelling, until the light came and made an end of them. 
the next thing was to untie the sac

ks and let out the dwarves. they were nearly 
suffocated, and very annoyed: they had not at all enjoyed lying there listening to the 
trolls making plans for roasting them and squashing them and mincing them. they had 
to hear bilbo's account of what had happened to him twice over, before they were 
satisfied. 
"silly time to go practising pinching and pocket-picking," said bombur, "when what we 
wanted was fire and food!" 
"and that's just what you wouldn't have got of those fellows without a struggle, in any 
case," said gandalf. 
"anyhow you are wasting time now. don't you realize that the trolls must have a cave or 
a hole dug s

they searched about, and soon found the marks of trolls' stony boots going away 
through the trees. they followed the tracks up the hill, until hidden by bushes they came 
on a big door of stone leading to a cave. but they could not open it, not though they all 
pushed while gandalf tried various incantations. 
"would this be any good?" asked bilbo, when they were getting tired and angry. "i found 
it on the ground where the trolls had their fight." he held out a largish key, though no 
doubt william had thought it very small and secret. it must have fallen out of his pocket, 
very luckily, before he was turned to stone. 
"why on earth didn't you mention it before?" they cried. 
gandalf grabbed it and fitted it into the key-hole. then the stone door swung back with 
one big push, and they all went inside. there were bones on the floor and a nasty smell 
was in the air; but there was a good deal of food jumbled carelessly

on shelves and on 
the ground, among an untidy litter of plunder, of all sorts from brass buttons to pots full of 
gold coins standing in a corner. there were lots of clothes, too, hanging on the walls-too 
small for trolls, i am afraid they belonged to victims-and among them were several 
swords of various makes, shapes, and sizes. two caught their eyes particularly, 
because of their beautiful scabbards and jewelled hilts. gandalf and thorin each took 
one of these; and bilbo took a knife in a leather sheath. 
it would have made only a tiny pocket-knife for a troll, but it was as good as a short 
sword for the hobbit.

usly. "they were not made by any troll, nor by any smith among men in these parts 
and days; but when we can read the runes on them, we shall know more about them." 
"let's get out of this horrible smell!" said fili so they carried out the pots of coins, and 
such food as was un-touched and looked fit to eat, also one barrel of ale which was still 
full. by that time they felt like breakfast, and being very hungry they did not turn their 
noses up at what they had got from the trolls' larder. their own provisions were very 
scanty. now they had bread and cheese, and plenty of ale, and bacon to toast in the 
embers of the fire. 
after that they slept, for their night had been disturbed; (and they did nothing more till the 
afternoon. then they i brought up their ponies, and carried away the pots of gold, and 
buried them very secretly not far from the track by the river, putting a great many spells

"i went on to spy out our road. it will soon become dangerous and difficult. also i was 
anxious about replenishing our small stock of provisions. i had not gone very far, 
however, when i met a couple of friends of mine from rivendell." 
"where's that?" asked bilbo, 
"don't interrupt!" said gandalf. "you will get there in a few days now, if we're lucky, and 
find out all about it as i was saying i met two of elrond's people. they were hurrying 
along for fear of the trolls. it was they who told me that three of them had come down 
from the mountains and settled in the woods not far from the road; they had frightened 
everyone away from the district, and they waylaid strangers. 
"i immediately had a feeling that i was wanted back. looking behind i saw a fire in the 
distance and made for it. so now you know. please be more careful, next time, or we 
shall never get anywhere!" 
"thank you!" said thorin.

s that day, even though the weather improved; nor the next 
day, nor the day after. they had begun to feel that danger was not far away on either 
side. they camped under the stars, and their horses had more to eat than they had; for 
there was plenty of grass, but there was not much in their bags, even with what they had 
got from the trolls. one morning they forded a river at a wide shallow place full of the 
noise of stones and foam. the far bank was steep and slippery. when they got to the top 
of it, leading their ponies, they saw that the great mountains had marched down very 
near to them. already they i seemed only a day's easy journey from the feet of the 
nearest. dark and drear it looked, though there were patches of sunlight on its brown 
sides, and behind its shoulders the tips of snowpeaks gleamed.

shed and strong in a few 
days there. their clothes were mended as well as their bruises, their tempers and their 
hopes. their bags were filled with food and provisions light to carry but strong to bring 
them over the mountain passes. their plans were improved with the best advice. so the 

time came to mid- summer eve, and they were to go on again with the early sun on 
midsummer morning. 
elrond knew all about runes of every kind. that day he looked at the swords they had 
brought from the trolls' lair, and he said: "these are not troll-make. they are old swords, 
very old swords of the high elves of the west, my kin. they were made in gondolin for 
the goblin-wars. they must have come from a dragon's hoard or goblin plunder, for 
dragons and goblins destroyed that city many ages ago. this, thorin, the runes name 
orcrist, the goblin-cleaver in the ancient tongue of gondolin; it was a famous blade. 
this, gandalf, was glamdring, foe-hammer that the king of gondolin once wore. keep

 well!" 
"whence did the trolls get them, i wonder?" said thorin looking at his 
sword with new interest. 
"i could not say," said elrond, "but one may guess that your trolls had plundered other 
plunderers, or come on the remnants of old robberies in some hold in the mountains of 
the north. i have heard that there are still forgotten treasures of old to be found in the 
deserted caverns of the mines of moria, since the dwarf and goblin war." 
thorin pondered these words. "i will keep this sword in honour," he said. 
"may it soon cleave goblins once again!" 
"a wish that is likely to be granted soon enough in the mountains!" said elrond. "but 
show me now your map!

 live on the east 
side of these truly hospitable mountains," said thorin, not quite knowing what to say all 
at once in a moment, when obviously the exact truth would not do at all. 
"he is a liar, o truly tremendous one!" said one of the drivers. "several of our people 
were struck by lightning in the cave, when we invited these creatures to come below; 
and they are as dead as stones. also he has not explained this!" he held out the sword 
which thorin had worn, the sword which came from the trolls' lair. 
the great goblin gave a truly awful howl of rage when he looked at it, and all his 
soldiers gnashed their teeth, clashed their shields, and stamped. 
they knew the sword at once. it had killed hundreds of goblins in its time, when the fair 
elves of gondolin hunted them in the hills or did battle before their walls. they had called 
it orcrist, goblin-cleaver, but the goblins called it simply biter. they hated it and hated 
worse any one that carried it.

felt for matches and he could not find any at all, and that shattered his hopes 
completely. just as well for him, as he agreed when he came to his senses. goodness 
knows what the striking of matches and the smell of tobacco would have brought on him 
out of dark holes in that horrible place. still at the moment he felt very crushed. but in 
slapping all his pockets and feeling all round himself for matches his hand came on the 
hilt of his little sword - the little dagger that he got from the trolls, and that he had quite 
forgotten; nor do the goblins seem to have noticed it, as he wore it inside his breeches. 
now he drew it out. it shone pale and dim before his eyes. "so it is an elvish blade, too," 
he thought; "and goblins are not very near, and yet not far enough." 
but somehow he was comforted. it was rather splendid to be wearing a blade made in 
gondolin for the goblin-wars of which so many songs had sung; and also he had noticed 
that such weapons made a great impression on gobli

"go on, if you must," he said. "i'm just going to lie here and sleep and dream of food, if i 
can't get it any other way. i hope i never wake up again." 
at that very moment balin, who was a little way ahead, called out: "what was that? i 
thought i saw a twinkle of light in the forest." 
they all looked, and a longish way off, it seemed, they saw a red twinkle in the dark; 
then another and another sprang out beside it. even bombur got up, and they hurried 
along then, not caring if it was trolls or goblins. the light was in front of them and to the 
left of the path, and when at last they had drawn level with it, it seemed plain that torches 
and fires were burning under the trees, but a good way off their track. 
"it looks as if my dreams were coming true," gasped bombur puffing up behind. he 
wanted to rush straight off into the wood after the lights. but the others remembered only 
too well the warnings of the wizard and of beorn. "a feast would be no good, if we never

n, who was rather fond the hobbit. 
he said he would come inside at least and perhaps a bit of the way too, really to call for 
help if necessary. 
the most that can be said for the dwarves is this: they intended to pay bilbo really 
handsomely for his services; they had brought him to do a nasty job for them, and they 

did not mind the poor little fellow doing it if he would; but they would all have done their 
best to get him out of trouble, if he got into it, as they did in the case of the trolls at the 
beginning of their adventures before they had any particular reasons for being grateful to 
him. there it is: dwarves are not heroes, but calculating folk with a great idea of the 
value of money; some are tricky and treacherous and pretty bad lots; some are not, but 
are decent enough people like thorin and company, if you don't expect too much.

ilbo. they came to the river that marked the very edge of 
the borderland of the wild, and to the ford beneath the steep bank, which you may 
remember. the water was swollen both with the melting of the snows at the approach of 
summer, and with the daylong rain; but they crossed with some difficulty, and pressed 
forward, as evening fell, on the last stage of their journey. this was much as it had been 
before, except that the company was smaller, and more silent; also this time there were 
no trolls. 
at each point on the road bilbo recalled the happenings and the words of a year ago-it 
seemed to him more like ten-so that, of course, he quickly noted the place where the 
pony had fallen in the river, and they had turned aside for their nasty adventure with tom 
and bert and bill. not far from the road they found the gold of the trolls, which they had 

buried, still hidden and untouched. "i have enough to last me my time," said bilbo, when 
they had dug it up. "you had better take this,
