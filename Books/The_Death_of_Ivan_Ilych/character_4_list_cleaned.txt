[CHARACTER] - 
      ivan's colleague and friend. [CHARACTER] is a well-dressed, playful, thoroughly proper man. he ignores life's unpleasantness. at ivan's funeral, he is immune to all depressing influences and maintains his jovial and lighthearted demeanor. ivan mentions that [CHARACTER] reminds him very much of his former self, and thus it is clear that [CHARACTER] is a kind of double for ivan. the fact that "[CHARACTER]" is german for "black," hints at tolstoy's belief in the emptiness and ultimate demise of such an attitude toward life.
