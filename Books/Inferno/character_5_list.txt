Lucifer - 
                The
prince of Hell, also referred to as Dis. Lucifer resides at the
bottom of the Ninth (and final) Circle of Hell, beneath the Earth's
surface, with his body jutting through the planet's center. An enormous
giant, he has three faces but does not speak; his three mouths are busy
chewing three of history's greatest traitors: Judas, the betrayer
of Christ, and Cassius and Brutus, the betrayers of Julius Caesar.
