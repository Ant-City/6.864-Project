_ant. e._ good signior angelo, you must excuse us all;
my wife is shrewish when i keep not hours:
say that i linger’d with you at your shop
to see the making of her carcanet,
and that to-morrow you will bring it home.                           5
but here’s a villain that would face me down
he met me on the mart, and that i beat him,
and charged him with a thousand marks in gold,
and that i did deny my wife and house.
thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean

bring it, i pray you, to the porpentine;
for there’s the house: that chain will i bestow--
be it for nothing but to spite my wife--
upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.
since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,                       120
i’ll knock elsewhere, to see if they’ll disdain me.

_ang._ i’ll meet you at that place some hour hence.
