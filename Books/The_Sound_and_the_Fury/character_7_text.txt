courageous being who was to him but a touch and a sound

splashed water on caddy. some of it splashed on versh and me and versh

"i'll feed him tonight." caddy said. "sometimes he cries when versh feeds 
him."  
"take this tray up." dilsey said. "and hurry back and feed benjy."  
"dont you want caddy to feed you." caddy said.

has he got to keep that old dirty slipper on the table, quentin said. why 
dont you feed him in the kitchen. it's like eating with a pig.  
if you dont like the way we eat, you'd better not come to the table, jason 
said.

steam came off of roskus. he was sitting in front of the stove. the oven 
door was open and roskus had his feet in it. steam came off the bowl. 
caddy put the spoon into

it got down below the mark. then the bowl was empty. it went away. "he's 
hungry tonight." caddy said. the bowl came back. i couldn't see the spot. 
then i could. "he's starved, tonight." caddy said. "look how much he's 
eaten."  
19.24 
yes he will, quentin said. you all send him out to spy on me. i hate this 
house. i'm going to run away.

so bad now i cant scarcely move. climbing them stairs all evening."

oh, i wouldn't be surprised, jason said. i wouldn't be surprised at 
anything you'd do.  
quentin threw her napkin on the table.  
hush your mouth, jason, dilsey said. she went and put her arm around

"she sulling again, is she." roskus said.  
"hush your mouth." dilsey said.

quentin pushed dilsey away. she looked at jason. her mouth was red. 
she picked up her glass of water and swung her arm back, looking at 
jason. dilsey caught her arm. they fought. the glass broke on the table, 
and the water ran into the table. quentin was running.

caddy gave me the cushion, and i could look at the cushion and the mirror 
and the fire.  
"we must be quiet while quentin's studying." father said. "what are you

we didn't go to our room.  
"this is where we have the measles." caddy said. "why do we have to sleep

"what you care where you sleep." dilsey said. she shut the door and sat

looked in our door and came in and stooped over the bed and kissed me 
on the forehead.

there were two beds. quentin got in the other one. he turned his face to

 lot of time and trouble before i learned that the best way 
to take all people, black or white, is to take them for what they think they 
are, then leave them alone. that was when i realisedthat a digger is not a 
person so much as a form of behavior; a sort of obverse reflection of the 
white people he lives among. but i thought at first that i ought to miss 
having a lot of them around me because i thought that northerners 
thought i did, but i didn't know that i really had missed roskus and dilsey 
and them until that morning in virginia. the train was stopped when i 
waked and i raised the shade and looked out. the car was blocking a road 
crossing, where two white fences came down a hill and then sprayed 
outward and downward like part of the skeleton of a horn, and there was a 

nigger on a mule in the middle of the stiff ruts, waiting for the train to 
move. how long he had been there i didn't know, but he sat straddle of the 
mule, his head wrapped in a piece of blanket, as if they

and the released surging of feet moving already, feeling earth in the scuffed 
floor, and the day like a pane of glass struck a light, sharp blow, and my 
insides would move, sitting still. moving sitting still. my bowels moved for 
thee. one minute she was standing in the door. benjy. bellowing. 
benjamin the child of mine old age bellowing. caddy! caddy!  
     i'm going to run away. he began to cry she went and touched him. 
hush. i'm not going to. hush. he hushed. dilsey.

     can he smell that new name they give him? can he smell bad luck?  
     what he want to worry about luck for? luck cant do him no hurt.  
     what they change his name for then if aint trying to help his luck?  
     the car stopped, started, stopped again. below the window i watched 
the crowns of people's heads passing beneath new straw hats not yet 
unbleached. there were women in the car now, with mar

niggers say a drowned man's shadow was watching for him in the water all 
the time. it twinkled and glinted, like breathing, the float slow like 
breathing too, and debris half submerged, healing out to the sea and the 
caverns and the grottoes of the sea. the displacement of water is equal to 
the something of something. reducto absurdum of all human experience, 
and two six-pound flat-irons weigh more than one tailor's goose. what a 
sinful waste dilsey would say. benjy knew it when damuddy died. he 
cried. he smell hit. he smell hit.  
     the tug came back downstream, the water shearing in long rolling 
cylinders, rocking the float at last with the echo of passage, the float 
lurching onto the rolling cylinder with a plopping sound and a long jarring 
noise as the door rolled back and two men emerged, carrying a shell. they 
set it in the water and a moment later bland came out, with the sculls. he

twilight and the sense of water peaceful and swift beyond. then the car 
went on, the draft building steadily up in the open door until it was 
drawing steadily through the car with the odor of summer and darkness 
except honeysuckle. honeysuckle was the saddest odor of all, i think. i 
remember lots of them. wistaria was one. on the rainy days when mother 
wasn't feeling quite bad enough to stay away from the windows we used to 
play under it. when mother stayed in bed dilsey would put old clothes on 
us and let us go out in the rain because she said rain never hurt young 
folks. but if mother was up we always began by playing on the porch until 
she said we were making too much noise, then we went out and played 
under the wisteria frame.   
      this was where i saw the river for the last time this morning, about 
here. i could feel water beyond the twilight, smell. when it bloomed in the 
spring and it rained the smell was everywhere you didn't notice it so much

benjamin. dilsey said it was because mother was too proud for him. they 
come into white people's lives like that in sudden sharp black trickles that 
isolate white facts for an instant in unarguable truth like under a 
microscope; the rest of the time just voices that laugh when you see 
nothing to laugh at, tears when no reason for tears. they will bet on the 
odd or even number of mourners at a funeral. a brothel full of them in

says beyond the door. i went on down stairs. there wasn't anybody in the 
diningroom, then i heard her in the kitchen. she was trying to make dilsey 
let her have another cup of coffee. i went in.  
      "i reckon that's your school costume, is it?" i says. "or maybe today's a 
holiday?"  
      "just a half a cup, dilsey," she says. "please."

      "come on," i says. "put that cup in the sink and come in here."

      "you may think you can run over me like you do your grandmother and 
everybody else," i says. "but you'll find out different. i'll give you ten 
seconds to put that cup down like i told you."  
      she quit looking at me. she looked at dilsey. "what time is it, dilsey?" 
she says. "when it's ten seconds, you whistle. just a half a cup. dilsey, pl--"

caught that hand too and held her like a wildcat. "you will, will you?" i 
says. "you think you will?"

kimono came unfastened, flapping about her, dam near naked. dilsey came 
hobbling along. i turned and kicked the door shut in her face.  
      "you keep out of here," i says.  
      quentin was leaning against the table, fastening her kimono. i looked at 
her.  
      "now," i says. "i want to know what you mean, playing out of school 
and telling your grandmother lies and forging her name on your report and 
worrying her sick. what do you mean by it?"

      dilsey came in the door. "you, jason," she says.  
      "you get out of here, like i told you," i says, not even looking back. "i 
want to know where you go when you play out of school," i says. "you keep 
off the streets, or i'd see you. who do you play out with? are you hiding out 
in the woods with one of those dam slick-headed jellybeans? is that where 
you go?"  
      "you--you old goddam!" she says. she fought, but i held her. "you

"you may can scare an old woman off, but i'll

      "you wait until i get this belt out and i'll show you," i says, pulling my 
belt out. then dilsey grabbed my arm.

      "dilsey," quentin says. "dilsey."  
      "i aint gwine let him," dilsey says. "dont you worry, honey." she held to 
my arm. then the belt came out and i jerked loose and flung her away. she 
stumbled into the table. she was so old she couldn't do any more than 
move hardly. but that's all right: we need somebody in the kitchen to eat 
up the grub the young ones cant tote off. she came hobbling between us,

somebody wont do you. hit me," she says.

    "i dont put no devilment beyond you," she says. then i heard mother 
on the stairs. i might have known she wasn't going to keep out of it. i let go. 
she stumbled back against the wall, holding her kimono shut.  
      "all right," i says. "we'll just put this off a while. but dont think you can 
run it over me. i'm not an old woman, nor an old half dead nigger, either. 
you dam little slut," i says.  
      "dilsey," she says. "dilsey, i want my mother."  
      dilsey went to her. "now, now," she says. "he aint gwine so much as lay

      i went on out the back to back the car out, then i had to go all the way 
round to the front before i found them.  
      "i thought i told you to put that tire on the back of the car," i says.  
      "i aint had time," luster says. "aint nobody to watch him till mammy

to keep him around here where people can see him?" i made them go on, 
before he got started bellowing good. it's bad enough on sundays, with that 
dam field full of people that haven't got a side show and six niggers to feed, 
knocking a dam oversize mothball around. he's going to keep on running 
up and down that fence and bellowing every time they come in sight until 
first thing i know they're going to begin charging me golf dues, then 
mother and dilsey'll have to get a couple of china door knobs and a 
walking stick and work it out, unless i play at night with a lantern. then 
they'd send us all to jackson, maybe. god knows, they'd hold old home 
week when that happened.  
      i went on back to the garage. there was the tire, leaning against the 
wall, but be damned if i was going to put it on. i backed out and turned 
around. she was standing by the drive. i says,

she sent quentin home for me to feed too i says i guess that's right too, 
instead of me having to go way up north for a job they sent the job down 
here to me and then mother begun to cry and i says it's not that i have any

then they came and said they were ready to start. mother stopped crying 
then. she pulled her veil down and we went down stairs. uncle maury was 
coming out of the diningroom, his handkerchief to his mouth. they kind of 
made a lane and we went out the door just in time to see dilsey driving ben

uncle maury kept saying poor little sister, poor little sister, talking around 
his mouth and patting mother's hand. talking around whatever it was.  
      "have you got your band on?" she says. "why dont they go on, before 
benjamin comes out and makes a spectacle. poor little boy. he doesn't

      "well, they brought my job home tonight" because all the time we kept 
hoping they'd get things straightened out and he'dfool keep her because 
mother kept saying she would at least have enough regard for the family 
not to jeopardise my chance after she and quentin had had theirs.  
      "and whar else do she belong?" dilsey says. "who else gwine raise her

      "why aint she gwine sleep in here," dilsey says. "in the same room 
whar i put her maw to bed ev'y night of her life since she was big enough to 
sleep by herself."  
      "you dont know," mother says. "to have my own daughter cast off by 
her husband. poor little innocent baby," she says, looking at quentin. "you 
will never know the suffering you've caused."  
      "hush, caroline," father says.  
      "what you want to go on like that fo jason fer?" dilsey says.  
      "i've tried to protect him," mother says. "i've always tried

to protect him 
from it. at least i can do my best to shield her."  
      "how sleepin in dis room gwine hurt her, i like to know," dilsey says.  
      "i cant help it," mother says. "i know i'm just a troublesome old 
woman. but i know that people cannot flout god's laws with impunity."  
      "nonsense," father says. "fix it in miss caroline's room then, dilsey."  
      "you can say nonsense," mother says. "but she must never know. she 
must never even learn that name. dilsey, i forbid you ever to speak that 
name in her hearing. if she could grow up never to know that she had a 
mother, i would thank god."  
      "dont be a fool," father says.  
      "i have never interfered with the way you brought them up," mother 
says. "but now i cannot stand anymore. we must decide this now, tonight. 
either that name is never to be spoken in her hearing, or she must go, or i 
will go. take your choice."  
      "hush," father says. "you're just upset. fix it in here, dilsey

      "en you's about sick too," dilsey says. "you looks like a hant. you git in 
bed and i'll fix you a toddy and see kin you sleep. i bet you aint had a full 
night's sleep since you lef."  

      "no," mother says. "dont you know what the doctor says? why must 
you encourage him to drink? that's what's the matter with him now. look 
at me, i suffer too, but i'm not so weak that i must kill myself with 
whiskey."  
      "fiddlesticks," father says. "what do doctors know? they make their 
livings advising people to do whatever th

 are not doing at the time, which 
is the extent of anyone's knowledge of the degenerate ape. you'll have a 
minister in to hold my hand next." then mother cried, and he went out. 
went down stairs, and then i heard the sideboard. i woke up and heard 
him going down again. mother had gone to sleep or something, because 
the house was quiet at last. he was trying to be quiet too, because i 
couldn't hear him, only the bottom of his nightshirt and his bare legs in 
front of the sideboard.  
      dilsey fixed the cradle and undressed her and put her in it. she never 
had waked up since he brought her in the house.  
      "she pretty near too big fer hit," dilsey says. "dar now. i gwine spread 
me a pallet right across de hall, so you wont need to git up in de night."  
      "i wont sleep," mother says. "you go on home. i wont mind. i'll be 
happy to give the rest of my life to her, if i can just prevent--"  
      "hush, now," dilsey says. "we gwine take keer of her. en you go on to

rgot something and wanted it again, so they let me take it. mink was 
driving. i bought him a cigar, so we drove around until it begun to get dark 
on the back streets where they wouldn't see him. then mink said he'd have 
to take the team on back and so i said i'd buy him another cigar and so we 
drove into the lane and i went across the yard to the house. i stopped in the 
hall until i could hear mother and uncle maury upstairs, then i went on 
back to the kitchen. she and ben were there with dilsey. i said mother 
wanted her and i took her into the house. i found uncle maury's raincoat 
and put it around her and picked her up and went back to the lane and got 
in the hack. i told mink to drive to the depot. he was afraid to pass the 
stable, so we had to go the back way and i saw her standing on the corner 
under the light and i told mink to drive close to the walk and when i said 
go on, to give the team a bat. then i took the raincoat off of her and held 
her to the window and caddy saw

ays. "damn you."  
      "sure," i says. "that's all right too. mind what i say, now. after number 
17, and i tell them."  
      after she was gone i felt better. i says i reckon you'll think twice before 
you deprive me of a job that was promised me. i was a kid then. i believed 
folks when they said they'd do things. i've learned better since. besides, 
like i say i guess i dont need any man's help to get along i can stand on my 
own feet like i always have. then all of a sudden i thought of dilsey and 
uncle maury. i thought how she'd get around dilsey and that uncle maury 
would do anything for ten dollars. and there i was, couldn't even get away 
from the store to protect my own mother. like she says, if one of you had 

to be taken, thank god it was you left me i can depend on you and i says 
well i dont reckon i'll ever get far enough from the store to get out of your 
reach. somebody's got to hold on to what little we have left, i reckon.  
      so as soon as i got home i fixed di

lsey. i told dilsey she had leprosy and 
i got the bible and read where a man's flesh rotted off and i told her that if 
she ever looked at her or ben or quentin they'd catch it too. so i thought i 
had everything all fixed until that day when i came home and found ben 
bellowing. raising hell and nobody could quiet him. mother said, well, get 
him the slipper then. dilsey made out she didn't hear. mother said it again 
and i says i'd go i couldn't stand that dam noise. like i say i can stand lots 
of things i dont expect much from them but if i have to work all day long in 
a dam store dam if i dont think i deserve a little peace and quiet to eat 
dinner in. so i says i'd go and dilsey says quick, "jason!"  
      well, like a flash i knew what was up, but just to make sure i went and 
got the slipper and brought it back, and just like i thought, when he saw it

you'd thought we were killing him. so i made dilsey own up, then i told 
mother. we had to take her up to bed then, and after things got quieted 
down a little i put the fear of god into dilsey. as much as you can into a 
nigger, that is. that's the trouble with nigger servants, when they've been 
with you for a long time they get so full of self importance that they're not 
worth a dam. think they run the whole family.  
      "i like to know whut's de hurt in lettin dat po chile see her own baby," 
dilsey says. "if mr jason was still here hit ud be different."  
      "only mr jason's not here," i says. "i know you wont pay me any mind, 
but i reckon you'll do what mother says. you

ing her like this 
until you get her into the graveyard too, then you can fill the whole house 
full of ragtag and bobtail. but what did you want to let that dam boy see her 
for?"  
      "you's a cold man, jason, if man you is," she says. "i thank de lawd i 
got mo heart den cat, even ef hit is black."  
      "at least i'm man enough to keep that flour barrel full," i says. "and if 
you do that again, you wont be eating out of it either."  
      so the next time i told her that if she tried dilsey again, mother was 
going to fire dilsey and send ben to jackson and take quentin and go 
away. she looked at me for a while. there wasn't any street light close and i 

couldn't see her face much. but i could feel her looking at me. when we 
were little when she'd get mad and couldn't do anything about it her upper 
lip would begin to jump. everytime it jumped it would leave a little more of 
her teeth showing, and all the time she'd be as still as a post, not a muscle 
moving except her lip j

where the hell have you been?" i says. "riding around where the 
wenches could see you?"  
      "i come straight as i could," he says. "i had to drive clean around the 
square, wid all dem wagons."  
      i never found a nigger yet that didn't have an airtight alibi for whatever 
he did. but just turn one loose in a car and he's bound to show off. i got in 
and went on around the square. i caught a glimpse of earl in the door 
across the square.  
      i went straight to the kitchen and told dilsey to hurry up with dinner.  
      "quentin aint come yit," she says.  
      "what of that?" i says. "you'll be telling me next that luster's not quite 
ready to eat yet. quentin knows when meals are served in this house. 
hurry up with it, now."  

      mother was in her room. i gave her the letter. she opened it and took 
the check out and sat holding it in her hand. i went and got the shovel from 
the corner and gave her a match. "come on," i says. "get it over with. you'll 
be crying in a

day when my children will have to accept that, the 
wages of sin," she says. "i'd rather see even you dead in your coffin first."  
      "have it your way," i says. "are we going to have dinner soon?" i says. 
"because if we're not, i'll have to go on back. we're pretty busy today." she 
got up. "i've told her once," i says. "it seems she's waiting on quentin or 
luster or somebody. here, i'll call her. wait." but she went to the head of 
the stairs and called.  
      "quentin aint come yit," dilsey says.  
      "well, i'll have to get on back," i says. "i can get a sandwich downtown. 
i dont want to interfere with dilsey's arrangements," i says. well, that got 
her started again, with dilsey hobbling and mumbling back and forth, 
saying,  

      "all right, all right, ise puttin hit on fast as i kin."  
      "i try to please you all," mother says. "i try to make things as easy for 
you as i can."  
      "i'm not complaining, am i?" i says. "have i said a word except i had to

 saying that so 
long that i'm beginning to believe you" only i says you'd better be sure and 
not let me know you're gone because i'll sure have him on number 
seventeen that night and i says i think i know a place where they'll take her 
too and the name of it's not milk street and honey avenue either. then she 
begun to cry and i says all right all right i have as much pride about my 
kinfolks as anybody even if i dont always know where they come from.  
      we ate for a while. mother sent dilsey to the front to look for quentin 
again.  
      "i keep telling you she's not coming to dinner," i says.  
      "she knows better than that," mother says. "she knows i dont permit 

her to run about the streets and not come home at meal time. did you look 
good, dilsey?"  
      "dont let her, then," i says.  
      "what can i do," she says. "you have all of you flouted me. always."  
      "if you wouldn't come interfering, i'd make her mind," i says. "it 
wouldn't take me but about one da

kind, god knows he ought to do something for him but if you think i'm 
going to trust a thousand dollars' worth of delicate machinery to a 
halfgrown nigger or a grown one either, you'd better buy him one yourself 
because i says you like to ride in the car and you know you do.  
      dilsey said she was in the house. i went on into the hall and listened, 
but i didn't hear anything. i went up stairs, but just as i passed her door 
she called me.  
      "i just wanted to know who it was," she says. "i'm here alone so much 
that i hear every sound."  
      "you dont have to stay here," i says. "you could spend the whole day 
visiting like other women, if you wanted to." she came to the door.

there for a while, thinking 
about that kitchen full of niggers and not one of them had time to lift a tire 
onto the rack and screw up a couple of bolts. it was kind of funny because 
even she couldn't have seen far enough ahead to take the pump out on 
purpose, unless she thought about it while he was letting out the air maybe. 

but what it probably was was somebody took it out and gave it to ben to 
play with for a squirt gun because they'd take the whole car to pieces if he 
wanted it and dilsey says, aint nobody teched yo car. what we want to fool 
with hit fer? and i says you're a nigger. you're lucky, do you know it? i says 
i'll swap with you any day because it takes a white man not to have 
anymore sense than to worry about what a little slut of a girl does.  
      i walked up to russell's. he had a pump. that was just an oversight on 
their part, i reckon. only i still couldn't believe she'd have had the nerve to. 
i kept thinking that. i dont know why it is i cant seem to learn

people going along the streets toward home. sometimes the sparrows 
never got still until full dark. the night they turned on the new lights 
around the courthouse it waked them up and they were flying around and 
blundering into the lights all night long. they kept it up two or three 
nights, then one morning they were all gone. then after about two months 
they all came back again.  
      i drove on home. there were no lights in the house yet, but they'd all be 
looking out the windows, and dilsey jawing away in the kitchen like it was 
her own food she was having to keep hot until i got there. you'd think to 
hear her that there wasn't but one supper in the world, and that was the 
one she had to keep back a few minutes on my account. well at least i 
could come home one time without finding ben and that nigger hanging on 
the gate like a bear and a monkey in the same cage. just let it come toward 
sundown and he'd head for the gate like a cow for the barn, hanging onto it 
and bobbing

wondered what he'd be thinking about, down there at the gate, watching 
the girls going home from school, trying to want something he couldn't 
even remember he didn't and couldn't want any longer. and what he'd 
think when they'd be undressing him and he'd happen to take a look at 
himself and begin to cry like he'd do. but like i say they never did enough 
of that. i says i know what you need you need what they did to ben then 
you'd behave. and if you dont know what that was i says, ask dilsey to tell 
you.  
      there was a light in mother's room. i put the car up and went on into 
the kitchen. luster and ben were there.  
      "where's dilsey?" i says. "putting supper on?"  
      "she up stairs wid miss cahline," luster says. "dey been goin hit. ever 
since miss quentin come home. mammy up there keepin um fum fightin.

      he put the poker back and got the cushion out of mother's chair and 
gave it to ben, and he hunkered down in front of the fireplace and got 
quiet.  
      i read the paper. there hadn't been a sound from upstairs when dilsey

ready.

they were straight up and three feet apart. i heard her at mother's door, 
then i heard her calling quentin, like the door was locked, then she went 
back to mother's room and then mother went and talked to quentin. then 
they came down stairs. i read the paper.  
      dilsey came back to the door. "come on," she says, "fo you kin think up 
some mo devilment. you just tryin yoself tonight."  
      i went to the diningroom. quentin was sitting with her head bent. she 
had painted her face again. her nose looked like a porcelain insulator.

the day dawned bleak and chill, a moving wall of gray light out of the 
northeast which, instead of dissolving into moisture, seemed to 
disintegrate into minute and venomous particles, like dust that, when 
dilsey opened the door of the cabin and emerged, needled laterally into her 
flesh, precipitating not so much a moisture as a substance partaking of the 
quality of thin, not quite congealed oil. she wore a stiff black straw hat 
perched upon her turban, and a maroon velvet cape with a border of 
mangy and anonymous fur above a dress of purple silk, and she stood in 
the door for a while with her myriad and sunken face lifted to the weather, 
and one gaunt hand flac-soled as the belly of a fish, then

as the palms of hands streaming flatly 
undulant upon the driving air. a pair of jaybirds came up from nowhere, 
whirled up on the blast like gaudy scraps of cloth or paper and lodged in 
the mulberries, where they swung in raucous tilt and recover, screaming 
into the wind that ripped their harsh cries onward and away like scraps of 

paper or of cloth in turn. then three more joined them and they swung and 
tilted in the wrung branches for a time, screaming. the door of the cabin 
opened and dilsey emerged once more, this time in a man's felt hat and an 
army overcoat, beneath the frayed skirts of which her blue gingham dress 
fell in uneven balloonings, streaming too about her as she crossed the yard 
and mounted the steps to the kitchen door.    
     a moment later she emerged, carrying an open umbrella now, which she 
slanted ahead into the wind, and crossed to the woodpile and laid the 
umbrella down, still open. immediately she caught at it and arrested it and 
held to it for a whil

into the box behind the stove. then she removed the 
overcoat and hat and took a soiled apron down from the wall and put it on 
and built a fire in the stove. while she was doing so, rattling the grate bars 
and clattering the lids, mrs compson began to call her from the head of the 
stairs.    
     she wore a dressing gown of quilted black satin, holding it close under 
her chin. in the other hand she held a red rubber hot water bottle and she 
stood at the head of the back stairway, calling "dilsey" at steady and 
inflectionless intervals into the quiet stairwell that descended into 
complete darkness, then opened again where a gray window fell across it. 
"dilsey," she called, without inflection or emphasis or haste, as though she 
were not listening for a reply at all. "dilsey."    
     dilsey answered and ceased clattering the stove, but before she could 
cross the kitchen mrs compson called her again, and before she crossed 
the diningroom and brought her head into relief against the

 gray splash of 
the window, still again.    
     "all right," dilsey said. "all right, here i is. i'll fill hit soon ez i git some 
hot water." she gathered up her skirts and mounted the stairs, wholly 
blotting the gray light. "put hit down dar en g'awn back to bed."    
     "i couldn't understand what was the matter," mrs compson said. "i've 
been lying awake for an hour at least, without hearing a sound from the 

kitchen."    
     "you put hit down and g'awn back to bed," dilsey said. she toiled 
painfully up the steps, shapeless, breathing heavily. "i'll have de fire gwine 
in a minute, en de water hot in two mot"    
     "i've been lying there for an hour, at least," mrs compson said. "i 
thought maybe you were waiting for me to come down and start the fire."    
     dilsey reached the top of the stairs and took the water bottle. "i'll fix hit 
in a minute," she said. "luster overslep dis mawnin, up half de night at dat

he hears about it. you know he wont."    
     "'twusn't none of jason's money he went on," dilsey said. "dat's one 
thing shot" she went on down the stairs. mrs compson returned to her 
room. as she got into bed again she could hear dilsey yet descending the 
stairs with a sort of painful and terrific slowness that would have become 
maddening had it not presently ceased beyond the flapping diminishment 
of the pantry door.    
     she entered the kitchen and built up the fire and began to prepare 
breakfast. in the midst of this she ceased and went to the window and 
looked out toward her cabin, then she went to the door and opened it and 
shouted into the driving weather.    
     "luster!" she shouted, standing to listen, til

ting her face from the wind. 
"you, luster!" she listened, then as she prepared to shout again luster 
appeared around the corner of the kitchen.    
     "ma'am?" he said innocently, so innocently that dilsey looked down at 
him, for a moment motionless, with something more than mere surprise.    
     "whar you at?" she said.    
     "nowhere," he said. "jes in de cellar."    
     "whut you coin in de cellar?" she said. "dont stand dar in de rain, fool," 
she said.    
     "aint coin nothin," he said. he came up the steps.    
     "dont you dare come in dis do widout a armful of wood," she said. "here 
i done had to tote yo wood en build yo fire bofe. didn't i tole you not to

benjy."    
     she shut the door. luster went to the woodpile. the five jaybirds 
whirled over the house, screaming, and into the mulberries again. he 
watched them. he picked up a rock and threw it. "whoo," he said. "git on 
back to hell, whar you belong at. 'taint monday yit."    
     he loaded himself mountainously with stove wood. he could not see 
over it, and he staggered to the steps and up them and blundered crashing 
against the door, shedding billets. then dilsey came and opened the door 
for him and he blundered across the kitchen. "you, luster!"hah!"" she 
shouted, but he had already hurled the wood into the box with a 
thunderous crash. "hah!" he said.    
     "is you tryin to wake up de whole house?" dilsey said. she hit him on 
the back of his head with the flat of her hand. "go on up dar and git benjy 
dressed, now."    
     "yessum," he said. he went toward the outer door.    
     "whar you gwine dilsey said.    
     "i thought i better go ro

     "you go on up dem back stairs like i tole you en git benjy's clothes on 
him," dilsey said. "go on, now."    
     "yessum," luster said. he returned and left by the diningroom door. 
after a while it ceased to flap. dilsey prepared to make biscuit. as she 
ground the sifter steadily above the bread board, she sang, to herself at 
first, something without particular tune or words, repetitive, mournful and 
plaintive, austere, as she ground a faint, steady snowing of flour onto the 
bread board. the stove had begun to heat the room and to fill it with 
murmurous minors of the fire, and presently she was singing louder, as if 
her voice too had been thawed out by the growing warmth, and then mrs 
compson called her

name again from within the house. dilsey raised her 
face as if her eyes could and did penetrate the walls and ceiling and saw the 

old woman in her quilted dressing gown at the head of the stairs, calling 
her name with machinelike regularity.    
     "oh, lawd," dilsey said. she set the sifter down and swept up the hem of 
her apron and wiped her hands and caught up the bottle from the chair on 
which she had laid it and gathered her apron about the handle of the kettle 
which was now jetting faintly. "jes a minute," she called. "de water jes dis 
minute got hot."    
     it was not the bottle which mrs compson wanted, however, and 
clutching it by the neck like a dead hen dilsey went to the foot of the stairs 
and looked upward.    
     "aint luster up dar

 wid him?" she said.    
     "luster hasn't been in the house. i've been lying here listening for him. i 
knew he would be late, but i did hope he'd come in time to keep benjamin 
from disturbing jason on jason's one day in the week to sleep in the 
morning."    
     "i dont see how you expect anybody to sleep, wid you standin in de hall, 
holl'in at folks fum de crack of dawn," dilsey said. she began to mount the 
stairs, toiling heavily. "i sent dat boy up dar half an hour ago."    
     mrs compson watched her, holding the dressing gown under her chin. 
"what are you going to do?" she said.    
     "gwine git benjy dressed en bring him down to de kitchen, whar he 
wont wake jason en quentin," dilsey said.    
     "haven't you started breakfast yet?"    
     "i'll tend to dat too," dilsey said. "you better git back in bed swell luster 
make yo fire. hit cold dis mawnin."
 
 ___________________________
 
    
     "i know it," mrs compson said. "my feet are like ice. they were so cold 
they waked me up." she watched dilsey mount the stairs. it took her a long 
while. "you know how it frets jason when breakfast is late," mrs compson 
said.    
     "i cant do but one thing at a time," dilsey said. "you git on back to bed, 
fo i has you on my hands dis mawnin too."    
     "if you're going to drop everything to dress benjamin, i'd better come 
down and get breakfast. you know as well as i do how jason acts when it's 
late."    
     "en who gwine eat yo messin?" dilsey said. "tell me dat. go on now," 

she said, toiling upward. mrs compson stood watching her as she 
mounted, steadying herself against the wall with one hand, holding her 
skirts up with the other.    
     "are you 
 
 ___________________________
 
going to wake him up just to dress him?" she said.    
     dilsey stopped. with her foot lifted to the next step she stood there, her 
hand against the wall and the gray splash of the window behind her, 
motionless and shapeless she loomed.    
     "he aint awake den?" she said.    
     "he wasn't when i looked in," mrs compson said. "but it's past his time. 
he never does sleep after half past seven. you know he doesn't."    
     dilsey said nothing. she made no further move, but though she could 
not see her save as a blobby shape without depth, mrs compson knew that 
she had lowered her face a little and that she stood now like cows do in the 
rain, holding the empty water bottle by its neck.    
     "you're not the one who has to bear it," mrs compson said. "it's not 
your responsibility. you can go away. you dont have to bear the brunt of it 
day in and day out. you owe nothing to them, to mr compson's memory. i

     dilsey said nothing. she turned slowly and descended, lowering her 
body from step to step, as a small child does, her hand against the wall. 
"you go on and let him alone," she said. "dont go in dar no mo, now. i'll 
send luster up soon as i find him. let him alone, now."    
     she returned to the kitchen. she looked into the stove, then she drew 
her apron over her head and donned the overcoat and opened the outer 
door and looked up and down the yard. the weather drove upon her flesh,

 minute, but the scene was empty of all else that moved. she 
descended the steps, gingerly, as if for silence, and went around the corner 
of the kitchen. as she did so luster emerged quickly and innocently from 
the cellar door.    
     dilsey stopped. "whut you up to?" she said.    
     "nothin," luster said. "mr jason say fer me to find out whar dat water 
leak in de cellar fum."    
     "en when wus hit he say fer you to do dat?" dilsey said. "last new 
year's day, wasn't hit?"    

     "i thought i jes be lookin whiles dey sleep," luster said. dilsey went to 
the cellar door. he stood aside and she peered down into the obscurity 
odorous of dank earth and mold and rubber.    
     "huh," dilsey said. she looked at luster again. he met her gaze blandly, 
innocent and open. "i dont know whut you up to, but you aint got no 
business coin hit. you jes tryin me too dis mawnin cause de others is, aint 
you? you git on up dar en s

     "yessum," luster said. he went on toward the kitchen steps, swiftly.    
     "here," dilsey said. "you git me another armful of wood while i got 
you."    
     "yessum," he said. he passed her on the steps and went to the woodpile. 
when he blundered again at the door a moment later, again invisible and 
blind within and beyond his wooden avatar, dilsey opened the door and 
guided him across the kitchen with a firm hand.    
     "jes thow hit at dat box again," she said. "jes thow hit."    
     "i got to," luster said, panting. "i cant put hit down no other way."    
     "den you stand dar en hold hit a while," dilsey said. she unloaded him a 
stick at a time. "whut got into you dis mawnin? here i vent you fer wood

stairs at me swell i rings de bell. you hear me."    
     "yessum," luster said. he vanished through the swing door. dilsey put 
some more wood in the stove and returned to the bread board. presently 
she began to sing again.    
     the room grew warmer. soon dilsey's skin had taken on a rich, lustrous 
quality as compared with that as of a faint dusting of wood ashes which 
both it and luster's had worn as she moved about the kitchen, gathering 
about her the raw materials of food, coordinating the meal. on the wall 
above a cupboard, invisible save at night, by lamp light and even then 
evincing an enigmatic profundity because it had but one hand, a cabinet 
clock ticked, then with a preliminary sound as if it had cleared its throat,

     "eight oclock," dilsey said. she ceased and tilted her head upward, 
listening. but there was no sound save the clock and the fire. she opened 
the oven and looked at the pan of bread, then stooping she paused while 
someone descended the stairs. she heard the feet cross the diningroom, 
then the swing door opened and luster entered, followed by a big man who 
appeared to have been shaped of some substance whose particles would 
not or did not cohere to one another or to the frame which supported it. 
his skin was de

ad looking and hairless; dropsical too, he moved with a 
shambling gait like a trained bear. his hair was pale and fine. it had been 
brushed smoothly down upon his brow like that of children in 
daguerrotypes. his eyes were clear, of the pale sweet blue of cornflowers, 
his thick mouth hung open, drooling a little.    
     "is he cold?" dilsey said. she wiped her hands on her apron and touched 
his hand.    
     "ef he aint, i is," luster said. "always cold easter. aint never seen hit 
fail. miss cahline say ef you aint got time to fix her hot water bottle to 
never mind about hit." "oh, lawd," dilsey said. she drew a chair into the 
corner between the woodbox and the stove. the man went obediently and 
sat in it. "look in de dinin room and see whar i laid dat bottle down," 
dilsey said. luster fetched the bottle from the diningroom

it and gave it to him. "hurry up, now," she said. "see ef jason wake now. 
tell em hit's all ready."    
     luster went out. ben sat beside the stove. he sat loosely, utterly 
motionless save for his head, which made a continual bobbing sort of 
movement as he watched dilsey with his sweet vague gaze as she moved 
about. luster returned.    
     "he up," he said. "miss cahline say put hit on de table." he came to the 
stove and spread his hands palm down above the firebox. "he up, too," he 
said. "gwine hit wid bofe feet dis mawnin."    
     "whut's de matter now?" dilsey said. "git away fum dar. how kin i do 
anything wid you standin over de stove?"

     "you ought to thought about dat whiles you was down dar in dat cellar,"

     "is dey one broke?" dilsey said.    
     "dat's whut he sayin," luster said. "say i broke hit."    
     "how could you, when he keep hit locked all day en night?"    
     "say i broke hit chunkin rocks at hit," luster said.

     "nome," luster said.

     "i never done hit," luster said. "ask benjy ef i did. i aint stud'in dat

     "who could a broke hit, den?" dilsey said. "he jes tryin hisself, to wake

     she went to the diningroom, where they heard her moving about, then 
she returned and set a plate at the kitchen table and set food there. ben 
watched her, slobbering, making a faint, eager sound.    
     "all right, honey," she said. "here yo breakfast. bring his chair, luster." 
luster moved the chair up and ben sat down, whimpering and slobbering.

int the spoon and cause ben to close his mouth upon the 
empty air, but it was apparent that luster's mind was elsewhere. his other 
hand lay on the back of the chair and upon that dead surface it moved 
tentatively, delicately, as if he were picking an inaudible tune out of the 

dead void, and once he even forgot to tease ben with the spoon while his 
fingers teased out of the slain wood a soundless and involved arpeggio until 
ben recalled him by whimpering again.    
     in the diningroom dilsey moved back and forth. presently she rang a 
small clear bell, then in the kitchen luster heard mrs compson and jason 
descending, and jason's voice, and he rolled his eyes whitely with 
listening.    
     "sure, i know they didn't break it," jason said. "sure, i know that. 
maybe the change of weather broke it."    
     "i dont see how it could have," mrs compson said. "your room stays

anybody's private affairs. i wouldn't put my foot over the threshold, even if 
i had a key."    
     "yes," jason said. "i know your keys wont fit. that's why i had the lock 
changed. what i want to know is, how that window got broken."    
     "luster say he didn't do hit," dilsey said.    
     "i knew that without asking him," jason said. "where's quentin?" he 
said.    
     "where she is ev'y sunday mawnin," dilsey said. "whut got into you de

     "well, we're going to change all that," jason said. "go up and tell her

     "you'd better do as he says," mrs compson said. "he's head of the house 
now. it's his right to require us to respect his wishes. i try to do it, and if i 
can, you can too."    
     "'taint no sense in him bein so bad tempered he got to make quentin git

stairs. "wid you naggin at her all de blessed time you in de house."    
     "hush, dilsey," mrs compson said. "it's neither your place nor mine to 
tell jason what to do. sometimes i think he is wrong, but i try to obey his 
wishes for you all's sakes. if i'm strong enough to come to the table, 
quentin can too."    
     dilsey went out. they heard her mounting the stairs. they heard her a 
long while on the stairs.    
     "you've got a prize set of servants," jason said. he helped his mother 
and himself to food. "did you ever have one that was worth killing? you 
must have had

the house work myself. i could at least take that much off your shoulders."    
     "and a fine pigsty we'd live in, too," jason said. "hurry up, dilsey," he 
shouted.    
     "i know you blame me," mrs compson said, "for letting them off to go to 
church today."    
     "go where?" jason said. "hasn't that damn show left yet?"    
     "to church," mrs compson said. "the darkies are having a special 
easter service. i promised dilsey two weeks ago that they could get off."    
     "which means we'll eat cold dinner," jason said, "or none at all."    
     "i know it's my fault," mrs compson said. "i know you blame me."    
     "for what?"

jason said. "you never resurrected christ, did you?"    
     they heard dilsey mount the final stair, then her slow feet overhead.

from one another in identical attitudes; the one cold and shrewd, with 
close-thatched brown hair curled into two stubborn hooks, one on either 
side of his forehead like a bartender in caricature, and hazel eyes with 
black-ringed irises like marbles, the other cold and querulous, with

his voice ceased, ebbed, left him staring at his mother with eyes that for an 
instant were quite empty of anything. it was as though his eyes were 
holding their breath, while his mother looked at him, her face flaccid and 
querulous, interminable, clairvoyant yet obtuse. as they sat so dilsey said,    
     "quentin. dont play wid me, honey. come on to breakfast, honey. dey 
waitin fer you."    
     "i cant understand it," mrs compson said. "it's just as if somebody had 
tried to break into the house--" jason sprang up. his chair crashed over 
backward. "what--" mrs compson said, staring at him as he ran past her 
and went jumping up the stairs, where he met dilsey. his face was now in 
shadow, and dilsey said,    
     "she sullin. yo maw aint unlocked--" but jason ran on past her

along the corridor to a door. he didn't call. he grasped the knob and tried 
it, then he stood with the knob in his hand and his head bent a little, as if 
he were listening to something much further away than the dimensioned 
room beyond the door, and which he already heard. his attitude was that 
of one who goes through the motions of listening in order to deceive 
himself as to what he already hears. behind him mrs compson mounted 
the stairs, calling his name. then she saw dilsey and she quit calling him 
and began to call dilsey instead.    
     "i told you she aint unlocked dat do yit," dilsey said.

matter of fact. "she carry the key with her?" he said. "has she got it now, i 
mean, or will she have--"    
     "dilsey," mrs compson said on the stairs.

met her. "give me the key," he said. he fell to pawing at the pockets of the 
rusty black dressing sacque she wore. she resisted.    
     "jason," she said. "jason! are you and dilsey trying to put me to bed 
again?" she said, trying to fend him off. "cant you even let me have sunday 
in peace?"    
     "the key," jason said, pawing at her. "give it here." he looked back at 
the door, as if he expected it to fly open before he could get back to it with 
the key he did not yet have.    
     "you, dilsey!" mrs compson said, clutching her sacque about her.    
     "give me the key, you old fool!" jason cried suddenly. from her pocket

said. "you know i never let anyone take my keys, dilsey," she said. she 
began to wail.

     "but on sunday morning, in my own house," mrs compson said. "when 
i've tried so hard to raise them christians. let me find the right key, jason," 
she said. she put her hand on his arm. then she began to struggle with 
him, but he flung her aside with a motion of his elbow and looked around 
at her for a moment, his eyes cold and harried, then he turned to the door 
again and the unwieldy keys.

it that dead and stereotyped transience of rooms in 
assignation houses. the bed had not been disturbed. on the floor lay a 
soiled undergarment of cheap silk a little too pink, from a half open bureau 
drawer dangled a single stocking. the window was open. a pear tree grew 
there, close against the house. it was in bloom and the branches scraped 
and rasped against the house and the myriad air, driving in the window, 
brought into the room the forlorn scent of the blossoms.

     "all right?" mrs compson said. dilsey followed her into the room and 
touched her.    
     "you come on and lay down, now," she said. "i find her in ten minutes."    
     mrs compson shook her off. "find the note," she said. "quentin left a 
note when he did it."    
     "all right," dilsey said. "i'll find hit. you come on to yo room, now."    
     "i knew the minute they named her quentin this would happen," mrs 
compson said. she went to

the bureau and began to turn over the scattered 
objects there--scent bottles, a box of powder, a chewed pencil, a pair of 
scissors with one broken blade lying upon a darned scarf dusted with 
powder and stained with rouge. "find the note," she said.    
     "i is," dilsey said. "you come on, now. me and jason'll find hit. you 
come on to yo room."    
     "jason," mrs compson said. "where is he?" she went to the door. dilsey 
followed her on down the hall, to another door. it was closed. "jason," she 
called through the door. there was no answer. she tried the knob, then she 
called him again. but there was still no answer, for he was hurling things 
backward out of the closet, garments, shoes, a suitcase. then he emerged 
carrying a sawn section of tongue-and-groove planking and laid it down 
and entered the closet again and emerged with a metal box. he set it on the 

bed and stood looking at the broken lock whi

ill carefully he sorted the papers, taking them up one at a time and 
shaking them. then he upended the box and shook it too and slowly 
replaced the papers and stood again, looking at the broken lock, with the 
box in his hands and his head bent. outside the window he heard some 
jaybirds swirl shrieking past and away, their cries whipping away along the 
wind, and an automobile passed somewhere and died away also. his 
mother spoke his name again beyond the door, but he didn't move. he 
heard dilsey lead her away up the hall, and then a door closed. then he 
replaced the box in the closet and flung the garments back into it and went 
down stairs to the telephone. while he stood there with the receiver to his 
ear waiting dilsey came down the stairs. she looked at him, without 
stopping, and went on.    
     the wire opened. "this is jason compson," he said, his voice so harsh 
and thick that he had to repeat himself. "jason compson," he said, 
controlling his voice. "have a car ready, wit

     he clapped the receiver back and crossed the diningroom, where the 
scarce broken meal lay cold now on the table, and entered the kitchen. 
dilsey was filling the hot water bottle. ben sat, tranquil and empty. beside 
him luster looked like a fice dog, brightly watchful. he was eating 
something. jason went on across the kitchen.    
     "aint you going to eat no breakfast?" dilsey said. he paid her no 
attention. "go on en eat yo breakfast, jason." he went on. the outer door 
banged behind him. luster rose and went to the window and looked out.    
     "whoo," he said. "whut happenin up dar? he been beatin miss

they heard jason pass the house in his car. then there was no sound in the 
kitchen save the simmering murmur of the kettle and the clock.

him, bellowing slowly with each expiration. luster came and shook him. 
"you hush dis minute!" he shouted. "here," he said. he hauled ben out of 
the chair and dragged the chair around facing the stove and opened the 
door to the firebox and shoved ben into the chair. they looked like a tug 
nudging at a clumsy tanker in a narrow dock. ben sat down again facing 
the rosy door. he hushed. then they heard the clock again, and dilsey slow 
on the stairs. when she entered he began to whimper again. then he lifted 
his voice.    
     "whut you done to him?" dilsey said. "why cant you let him lone dis 
mawnin, of all times?"    
     "i aint doin nothin to him," luster said. "mr jason skeered him, dat's

     they went out. dilsey stood for a while at the table, then she went and 
cleared the breakfast things from the diningroom and ate her breakfast and 
cleaned up the kitchen. then she removed her apron and hung it up and 
went to the foot of the stairs and listened for a moment. there was no 
sound. she donned the overcoat and the hat and went across to her cabin.    
     the rain had stopped. the air now drove out of the southeast, broken 
overhead into blue patches. upon the crest of a hill beyond the trees and

away. upon the air a bell came, then as if at a signal, other bells took up the 
sound and repeated it.    
     the cabin door opened and dilsey emerged, again in the maroon cape 
and the purple gown, and wearing soiled white elbow-length gloves and 
minus her headcloth now. she came into the yard and called luster. she 
waited a while, then she went to the house and around it to the cellar door, 
moving close to the wall, and looked into the door. ben sat on the steps. 

before him luster squatted on the damp floor. he held a saw in his left 
hand, the blade sprung a little by pressure of his hand, and he was in the 
act of striking t

he blade with the worn wooden mallet with which she had 
been making beaten biscuit for more than thirty years. the saw gave forth 
a single sluggish twang that ceased with lifeless alacrity, leaving the blade 
in a thin clean curve between luster's hand and the floor. still, inscrutable, 
it bellied.    
     "dat's de way he done hit," luster said. "i jes aint foun de right thing to 
hit it wid."    
     "dat's whut you doin, is it?" dilsey said. "bring me dat mallet," she 
said.    
     "i aint hurt hit," luster said.    
     "bring hit here," dilsey said. "put dat saw whar you got hit first."    
     he put the saw away and brought the mallet to her. then ben wailed 
again, hopeless and prolonged. it was nothing. just sound. it might have 
been all time and injustice and sorrow become vocal for an instant by a 
conjunction of planets.    
     "listen at him," luster said. "he been gwine on dat way ev'y since you

en de house. i dont know whut got in to him dis mawnin."    
     "bring him here," dilsey said.    
     "come on, benjy," luster said. he went back down the steps and took 
ben's arm. he came obediently, wailing, that slow hoarse sound that ships 
make, that seems to begin before the sound itself has started, seems to 
cease before the sound itself has stopped.    
     "run and git his cap," dilsey said. "dont make no noise miss cahline kin 
hear. hurry, now. we already late."    
     "she gwine hear him anyhow, ef you dont stop him," luster said.    
     "he stop when we git off de place," dilsey said. "he smellin hit. dat's 
whut hit is."    
     "smell whut, mammy?" luster said.    
     "you go git dat cap," dilsey said. luster went on. they stood in the cellar 
door, ben one step below her. the sky was broken now into scudding 
patches that dragged their swift shadows up out of th

e shabby garden, over 
the broken fence and across the yard. dilsey stroked ben's head, slowly and 
steadily, smoothing the bang upon his brow. he wailed quietly, 

unhurriedly. "hush," dilsey said. "hush, now. we be gone in a minute. 
hush, now." he wailed quietly and steadily.    
     luster returned, wearing a stiff new straw hat with a colored band and 
carrying a cloth cap. the hat seemed to isolate luster's skull, in the 
beholder's eye as a spotlight would, in all its individual planes and angles. 
so peculiarly individual was its shape that at first glance the hat appeared 
to be on the head of someone standing immediately behind luster. dilsey 
looked at the hat.    
     "

whyn't you wear yo old hat?" she said.

     "aw, mammy," luster said. "hit aint gwine rain."

from time to time as they went down the drive. they reached the gate.

the umbrella. a woman was with him. "here dey come," dilsey said. they

mother overtook them. frony wore a dress of bright blue silk and a 
flowered hat. she was a thin woman, with a flat, pleasant face.

gwine do ef hit rain?"    
     "git wet, i reckon," frony said. "i aint never stopped no rain yit."    
     "mammy always talkin bout hit gwine rain," luster said.

     "rev'un shegog kin do dat," frony said. "so dey tells."    
     they went on along the street. along its quiet length white people in 
bright clumps moved churchward, under the

then in the random and tentative sun. the wind was gusty, out of the 
southeast, chill and raw after the warm days.    
     "i wish you wouldn't keep on bringin him to church, mammy," frony 
said. "folks talkin."    
     "whut folks?" dilsey said.    
     "i hears em," frony said.    
     "and i knows whut kind of folks," dilsey said. "trash white folks. dat's 
who it is. thinks he aint good enough fer white church, but nigger church 
aint good enough fer him."    
     "dey talks, jes de same," frony said.    
     "den you send um to me," dilsey said. "tell um de good lawd dont keer 
whether he bright er not. dont nobody but white trash keer dat."    
     a street turned off at right angles, descending, and became a dirt road. 
on either hand the land dropped more sharply; a broad flat dotted with 
small cabins whos

, things of a once utilitarian value. what growth 
there was consisted of rank weeds and the trees were mulberries and 
locusts and sycamores--trees that partook also of the foul desiccation 
which surrounded the houses; trees whose very burgeoning seemed to be 
the sad and stubborn remnant of september, as if even spring had passed 
them by, leaving them to feed upon the rich and unmistakable smell of 
negroes in which they grew.    
     from the doors negroes spoke to them as they passed, to dilsey 
usually:    
     "sis' gibson! how you dis mawnin?" "i'm well. is you well?"    
     "i'm right well, i thank you."    
     they emerged from the cabins and struggled up the sharing levee to the 

road--men in staid, hard brown or black, with gold watch chains and now 
and then a stick; young men in cheap violent blues or stripes and 
swaggering hats; women a little stiffly sibilant, and children in garments 
bought second hand of white people, who looked at ben with the 
covertness of noc

     "dat's too bad. but rev'un shegog'll kyo dat. he'll give her de comfort en

     the road rose again, to a scene like a painted backdrop. notched into a 
cut of red clay crowned with oaks the road appeared to stop short off, like a 
cut ribbon. beside it a weathered church lifted its crazy steeple like a 
painted church, and the whole scene was as flat and without perspective as 
a painted car

whispers, they watched the insignificant looking man sitting dwarfed and 
countrified by the minister's imposing bulk, with something like 
consternation. they were still looking at him with consternation and 
unbelief when the minister rose and introduced him in rich, rolling tones 
whose very unction served to increase the visitor's insignificance.    
     "en dey brung dat all de way fum saint looey," frony whispered.    
     "i've knowed de lawd to use cuiser tools den dat," dilsey said. "hush,

     when the visitor rose to speak he sounded like a white man. his voice 
was level and cold. it sounded too big to have come from him and they 
listened at first through curiosity, as they would have to a monkey talking. 
they began to watch him as they would a man on a tight rope. they even 
forgot his insignificant appearance in the virtuosity with which he ran and 
poised and swooped upon the cold inflectionle

last, when with a sort of swooping glide he came to rest again beside the 
reading desk with one arm resting upon it at shoulder height and his 
monkey body as reft of all motion as a mummy or an emptied vessel, the 
congregation sighed as if it waked from a collective dream and moved a 
little in its seats. behind the pulpit the choir fanned steadily. dilsey 

whispered, "hush, now. dey fixin to sing in a minute."    
     then a voice said, "brethren."    
     the preacher had not moved. his arm lay yet across the desk, and he 
still held that pose while the voice died in sonorous echoes between the 
walls. it was as different as day and dark from his former tone, with a sad, 
timbrous quality like an alto horn, sinking into their hearts and speaking 
there again when it had ceased in fading and cumulate echoes.    
     "brethren and sisteren,"

for words, 
so that when he came to rest against the reading desk, his monkey face 
lifted and his whole attitude that of a serene, tortured crucifix that 
transcended its shabbiness and insignificance and made it of no moment, a 
long moaning expulsion of breath rose from them, and a woman's single 
soprano: "yes, jesus!"    
     as the scudding day passed overhead the dingy windows glowed and 
faded in ghostly retrograde. a car passed along the road outside, laboring 
in the sand, died away. dilsey sat bolt upright, her hand on ben's knee. 
two tears slid down her fallen cheeks, in and out of the myriad 
coruscations of immolation and abnegation and time.    
     "brethren," the minister said in a harsh whisper, without moving.    
     "yes, jesus!" the woman's voice said, hushed yet.    
     "breddren en sistuhn!" his voice rang again, with the horns. he 
removed his arm and stood erect and raised his hands. "i got de

     in the midst of the voices and the hands ben sat, rapt in his sweet blue 
gaze. dilsey sat bolt upright beside, crying rigidly and quietly in the 
annealment and the blood of the remembered lamb.    
     as they walked through the bright noon, up the sandy road with the 
dispersing congregation talking easily again group to group, she continued 
to weep, unmindful of the talk.    
     "he sho a preacher, mon!! he didn't look like much at first, but hush!"

     before they reached the street though she stopped and lifted her skirt 
and dried her eyes on the hem of her topmost underskirt. then they went 
on. ben shambled along beside dilsey, watching luster who anticked along 
ahead, the umbrella in his hand and his new straw hat slanted viciously in 
the sunlight, like a big foolish dog watching a small clever one. they 
reached the gate and entered. immediately ben began to whimper again,

     "nothin," dilsey said. "you tend to yo business en let de whitefolks tend

ben was still whimpering, though not loud. dilsey and frony went to the 
cabin. after a while dilsey emerged, again in the faded calico dress, and 
went to the kitchen. the fire had died down. there was no sound in the 
house. she put on the apron and went up stairs. there was no sound 
anywhere. quentin's room was as they had left it. she entered and picked 
up the undergarment and put the stocking back in the drawer and closed it.

listening. then she opened it and entered, entered a pervading reek of

     "well?" she said. "what is it?"    
     "hit's me," dilsey said. "you want anything?"    
     mrs compson didn't answer. after a while, without moving her head at 
all, she said: "where's jason?"    
     "he aint come back yit," dilsey said. "whut you want?"    
     mrs compson said nothing. like so many cold, weak people, when faced 

at last by the incontrovertible disaster she exhumed from somewhere a sort 
of fortitude, strength. in her case it was an unshakable conviction 
regarding the yet unplumbed event. "well," she said presently. "did you 
find it?"    
     "find whut? whut you talkin about?"    
     "the note. at least she would have enough consideration to leave a note.

bed. "you cant see to read, noways," she said. "you want me to raise de 
shade a little?"    
     "no. let them alone. go on and fix jason something to eat."    
     dilsey went out. she closed the door and returned to the kitchen. the 
stove was almost cold. while she stood there the clock above the cupboard 
struck ten times. "one oclock," she said aloud. "jason aint comin home. ise

ng at the cold stove. "i seed de first 
en de last." she set out some cold food on a table. as she moved back and 
forth she sang, a hymn. she sang the first two lines over and over to the 
complete tune. she arranged the meal and went to the door and called 
luster, and after a time luster and ben entered. ben was still moaning a 
little, as to himself.    
     "he aint never quit," luster said.    
     "y'all come on en eat," dilsey said. "jason aint comin to dinner." they 
sat down at the table. ben could manage solid food pretty well for himself, 
though even now, with cold food before him, dilsey tied a cloth about his 
neck. he and luster ate. dilsey moved about the kitchen, singing the two 
lines of the hymn which she remembered. "y'all kin g'awn en eat," she said. 
"jason aint comin home."    
     he was twenty miles away at that time. when he left the house he drove 
rapidly to town, overreaching the slow sabbath g

jolting, i can get something there. they drove on, along the streets where 
people were turning peacefully into houses and sunday dinners, and on out 
of town. he thought that. he wasn't thinking of home, where ben and 
luster were eating cold dinner at the kitchen table. something--the 
absence of disaster, threat, in any constant evil--permitted him to forget 
jefferson as any place which he had ever seen before, where his life must 
resume itself.    
     when ben and luster were done dilsey sent them outdoors. "and see 
kin you let him alone swell fo oclock. t. p. be here den."    
     "yessum," luster said. they went out. dilsey ate her dinner and cleared 
up the kitchen. then she went to the foot of the stairs and listened, but 
there was no sound. she returned through the kitchen and out the outer 
door and stopped on the steps. ben and luster were not in sight, but while 
she stood there she heard another sluggish twang from the direction of the 
cellar door and she went to t

the morning's scene.    
     "he done hit jes dat way," luster said. he contemplated the motionless 
saw with a kind of hopeful dejection. "i aint got de right thing to hit it wid 
yit," he said.    
     "en you aint gwine find hit down here, neither," dilsey said. "you take 
him on out in de sun. you bofe get pneumonia down here on dis wet flo."    
     she waited and watched them cross the yard toward a clump of cedar 
trees near the fence. then she went on to her cabin.    
     "now, dont you git started," luster said. "i had enough trouble wid you 
today." there was a hammock made of barrel staves slatted into woven 
wires. luster lay down in the swing, but ben went on vaguely and 
purposelessly. he began to whimper again. "hush, now," luster

eople move on and away.    
     "will you hush now?" luster said. "will you hush now?" he shook ben's 
arm. ben clung to the fence, wailing steadily and hoarsely. "aint you gwine 
stop?" luster said. "or is you?" ben gazed through the fence. "all right, 
den," luster said. "you want somethin to belier about?" he looked over his 
shoulder, toward the house. then he whispered: "caddy! beller now. 
"caddy! "caddy! "caddy!    
     a moment later, in the slow intervals of ben's voice, luster heard dilsey 
calling. he took ben by the arm and they crossed the yard toward her.    
     "i tole you he warnt gwine stay quiet," luster said.    
     "you vilyun!" dilsey said. "whut you done to him?"    
     "i aint done nothin. i tole you when dem folks start playin, he git started 
up."    
     "you come on here," dilsey said. "hush, benjy. hush, now." but he 
wouldn't hush. they crossed the yard quickly and went to the cabin and 
entered. "run git dat shoe," dilsey said. "dont you sturb miss cahl

down beside her and she held him, rocking back and forth, wiping his 
drooling mouth upon the hem of her skirt. "hush, now," she said, stroking 
his head. "hush. dilsey got you." but he bellowed slowly, abjectly, without 
tears; the grave hopeless sound of all voiceless misery under the sun. 
luster returned, carrying a white satin slipper. it was yellow now, and 
cracked, and soiled, and when they gave it into ben's hand he hushed for a 
while. but he still whimpered, and soon he lifted his voice again.    
     "you reckon you kin find t. p.?" dilsey said.

said. "will you think about yo ole mammy en drive dat surrey right?"

coat. he wailed steadily. she took the slipper from him and put it away and 
they went out. luster came up, with an ancient white horse in a battered 
and lopsided surrey.    
     "you gwine be careful, luster?" she said.    
     "yessum," luster said. she helped ben into the back seat. he had ceased

     "hit's his flower," luster said. "wait, i'll git him one."    
     "you set right dar," dilsey said. she went and took the cheekstrap. 
"now, hurry en git him one." luster ran around the house, toward the 
garden. he came back with a single narcissus.    
     "dat un broke," dilsey said. "whyn't you git him a good un?"    
     "hit de onliest one i could find," luster said. "y'all took all of um friday

both to blackmail the mother not only into staying away from jefferson for 
the rest of her life but into appointing him sole unchallengeable trustee of
