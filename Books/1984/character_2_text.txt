of being more dangerous than most. once when they passed in the corridor
she gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right into
him and for a moment had filled him with black terror. the idea had even
crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the thought police. that,
it was true, was very unlikely. still, he continued to feel a peculiar
uneasiness, which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility, whenever
she was anywhere near him.

the other person was a man named o'brien, a member of the inner party and
holder of some post so important and remote that winston had only a dim
idea of its nature. a momentary hush passed over the group of people
round the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an inner party member
approaching. o'brien was a large, burly man with a thick neck and a coarse,
humorous, brutal face. in spite of his formidable appearance he had a
certain charm of manner. he had a trick of resettling his spectacles on
his nose which was curiously disar

ming--in some indefinable way, curiously
civilized. it was a gesture which, if anyone had still thought in such
terms, might have recalled an eighteenth-century nobleman offering his
snuffbox. winston had seen o'brien perhaps a dozen times in almost as many
years. he felt deeply drawn to him, and not solely because he was intrigued
by the contrast between o'brien's urbane manner and his prize-fighter's
physique. much more it was because of a secretly held belief--or perhaps
not even a belief, merely a hope--that o'brien's political orthodoxy was
not perfect. something in his face suggested it irresistibly. and again,
perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face, but
simply intelligence. but at any rate he had the appearance of being a
person that you could talk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and
get him alone. winston h

ad never made the smallest effort to verify this
guess: indeed, there was no way of doing so. at this moment o'brien glanced
at his wrist-watch, saw that it was nearly eleven hundred, and evidently
decided to stay in the records department until the two minutes hate was
over. he took a chair in the same row as winston, a couple of places away.
a small, sandy-haired woman who worked in the next cubicle to winston was
between them. the girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind.

the next moment a hideous, grinding speech, as of some monstrous machine
running without oil, burst from the big telescreen a

nly through vague rumours. neither the brotherhood nor
the book was a subject that any ordinary party member would mention if
there was a way of avoiding it.

in its second minute the hate rose to a frenzy. people were leaping up and
down in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in an effort
to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen. the little
sandy-haired woman had turned bright pink, and her mouth was opening and
shutting like that of a landed fish. even o'brien's heavy face was flushed.
he was sitting very straight in his chair, his powerful chest swelling and
quivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave. the
dark-haired girl behind winston had begun crying out 'swine! swine! swine!'
and suddenly she picked up a heavy newspeak dictionary and flung it at the
screen. it struck goldstein's nose and bounced off; the voice continued
inexorably. in a lucid moment winston found that he was shouting with the
others and kicking his heel vio

his sub-human chanting of
'b-b!...b-b!' always filled him with horror. of course he chanted with the
rest: it was impossible to do otherwise. to dissemble your feelings, to
control your face, to do what everyone else was doing, was an instinctive
reaction. but there was a space of a couple of seconds during which the
expression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed him. and it was
exactly at this moment that the significant thing happened--if, indeed,
it did happen.

momentarily he caught o'brien's eye. o'brien had stood up. he had taken
off his spectacles and was in the act of resettling them on his nose with
his characteristic gesture. but there was a fraction of a second when
their eyes met, and for as long as it took to happen winston knew--yes, he
knew!--that o'brien was thinking the same thing as himself. an unmistakable
message had passed. it was as though their two minds had opened and the
thoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes. 'i am
with you,' o'brien

 seemed to be saying to him. 'i know precisely what you
are feeling. i know all about your contempt, your hatred, your disgust.
but don't worry, i am on your side!' and then the flash of intelligence
was gone, and o'brien's face was as inscrutable as everybody else's.

that was all, and he was already uncertain whether it had happened. such
incidents never had any sequel. all that they did was to keep alive in him
the belief, or hope, that others besides himself were the enemies of the
party. perhaps the rumours of vast underground conspiracies were true after
all--perhaps the brotherhood really existed! it was impossible, in spite
of the endless arrests and confessions and executions, to be sure that the
brothe

rhood was not simply a myth. some days he believed in it, some days
not. there was no evidence, only fleeting glimpses that might mean anything
or nothing: snatches of overheard conversation, faint scribbles on lavatory
walls--once, even, when two strangers met, a small movement of the hand
which had looked as though it might be a signal of recognition. it was all
guesswork: very likely he had imagined everything. he had gone back to his
cubicle without looking at o'brien again. the idea of following up their
momentary contact hardly crossed his mind. it would have been inconceivably
dangerous even if he had known how to set about doing it. for a second, two
seconds, they had exchanged an equivocal glance, and that was the end of
the story. but even that was a memorable event, in the locked loneliness in
which one had to live.

winston roused himself and sat up straighter. he let out a belch. the gin
was rising from his stomach.

his eyes re-focused on the page.

 to be frightened of their own children. and with
good reason, for hardly a week passed in which 'the times' did not carry
a paragraph describing how some eavesdropping little sneak--'child hero'
was the phrase generally used--had overheard some compromising remark
and denounced its parents to the thought police.

the sting of the catapult bullet had worn off. he picked up his pen
half-heartedly, wondering whether he could find something more to write
in the diary. suddenly he began thinking of o'brien again.

years ago--how long was it? seven years it must be--he had dreamed that he
was walking through a pitch-dark room. and someone sitting to one side of
him had said as he passed: 'we shall meet in the place where there is no
darkness.' it was said very quietly, almost casually--a statement, not a
command. he had walked on without pausing. what was curious was that at the
time, in the dream, the words had not made much impression on him. it was
only later and by degrees that they had seemed
 
 ___________________________
 
 to take on significance. he
could not now remember whether it was before or after having the dream that
he had seen o'brien for the first time, nor could he remember when he had
first identified the voice as o'brien's. but at any rate the identification
existed. it was o'brien who had spoken to him out of the dark.

winston had never been able to feel sure--even after this morning's flash
of the eyes it was still impossible to be sure whether o'brien was a friend
or an enemy. nor did it even seem to matter greatly. there was a link of
understanding between them, more important than affection or partisanship.
'we shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,' he had said.
winston did not know what it meant, only that in some way or another it
would come true.

the voice from the telescreen paused. a trumpet call, clear and beautiful,
floated into the stagnant air. the voice continued raspingly:

'attention! your attention, please! a ne
 
 ___________________________
 
well--just thought i'd ask you, old boy.'

'sorry,' said winston.

the quacking voice from the next table, temporarily silenced during the
ministry's announcement, had started up again, as loud as ever. for some
reason winston suddenly found himself thinking of mrs parsons, with her
wispy hair and the dust in the creases of her face. within two years those
children would be denouncing her to the thought police. mrs parsons would
be vaporized. syme would be vaporized. winston would be vaporized. o'brien
would be vaporized. parsons, on the other hand, would never be vaporized.
the eyeless creature with the quacking voice would never be vaporized.
the little beetle-like men who scuttle so nimbly through the labyrinthine
corridors of ministries they, too, would never be vaporized. and the girl
with dark hair, the girl from the fiction department--she would never be
vaporized either. it seemed to him that he knew instinctively who would
survive and who would perish: though just what it was that ma

heresy of heresies was common sense. and what was terrifying was not that
they would kill you for thinking otherwise, but that they might be right.
for, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? or that the
force of gravity works? or that the past is unchangeable? if both the past
and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is
controllable what then?

but no! his courage seemed suddenly to stiffen of its own accord. the face
of o'brien, not called up by any obvious association, had floated into his
mind. he knew, with more certainty than before, that o'brien was on his
side. he was writing the diary for o'brien--to o'brien: it was like an
interminable letter which no one would ever read, but which was addressed
to a particular person and took its colour from that fact.

the party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. it was
their final, most essential command. his heart sank as he thought of
the enormous powe

against him, the ease with which any party
intellectual would overthrow him in debate, the subtle arguments which he
would not be able to understand, much less answer. and yet he was in the
right! they were wrong and he was right. the obvious, the silly, and the
true had got to be defended. truisms are true, hold on to that! the solid
world exists, its laws do not change. stones are hard, water is wet,
objects unsupported fall towards the earth's centre. with the feeling that
he was speaking to o'brien, and also that he was setting forth an important
axiom, he wrote:


   freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. if that is
granted, all else follows.

from somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell of roasting
coffee--real coffee, not victory coffee--came floating out into the street.
winston paused involuntarily. for perhaps two seconds he was back in the
half-forgotten world of his childhood. then a door banged, seeming to cut
off the smell as abruptly a

he opened the diary. it was important to write something down. the woman
on the telescreen had started a new song. her voice seemed to stick into
his brain like jagged splinters of glass. he tried to think of o'brien,
for whom, or to whom, the diary was written, but instead he began thinking
of the things that would happen to him after the thought police took him
away. it would not matter if they killed you at once. to be killed was
what you expected. but before death (nobody spoke of such things, yet
everybody knew of them) there was the routine of confession that had to
be gone through: the grovelling on the floor and screaming for mercy, the
crack of broken bones, the smashed teeth and bloody clots of ha

why did you have to endure it, since the end was always the same? why was
it not possible to cut a few days or weeks out of your life? nobody ever
escaped detection, and nobody ever failed to confess. when once you had
succumbed to thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given date you would be
dead. why then did that horror, which altered nothing, have to lie embedded
in future time?

he tried with a little more success than before to summon up the image of
o'brien. 'we shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,' o'brien
had said to him. he knew what it meant, or thought he knew. the place where
there is no darkness was the imagined future, which one would never see,
but which, by foreknowledge, one could mystically share in. but with the
voice from the telescreen nagging at his ears he could not follow the train
of thought further. he put a cigarette in his mouth. half the tobacco
promptly fell out on to his tongue, a bitter dust which was diffi

spit out again. the face of big brother swam into his mind, displacing that
of o'brien. just as he had done a few days earlier, he slid a coin out of
his pocket and looked at it. the face gazed up at him, heavy, calm,
protecting: but what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache?
like a leaden knell the words came back at him:

 spinning out a present that had no future, seemed
an unconquerable instinct, just as one's lungs will always draw the next

sometimes, too, they talked of engaging in active rebellion against the
party, but with no notion of how to take the first step. even if the
fabulous brotherhood was a reality, there still remained the difficulty
of finding one's way into it. he told her of the strange intimacy that
existed, or seemed to exist, between himself and o'brien, and of the
impulse he sometimes felt, simply to walk into o'brien's presence, announce
that he was the enemy of the party, and demand his help. curiously enough,
this did not strike her as an impossibly rash thing to do. she was used to
judging people by their faces, and it seemed natural to her that winston
should believe o'brien to be trustworthy on the strength of a single flash
of the eyes. moreover she took it for granted that everyone, or nearly
everyone, secretly hated the party and wou

it had happened at last. the expected message had come. all his life, it
seemed to him, he had been waiting for this to happen.

he was walking down the long corridor at the ministry and he was almost
at the spot where julia had slipped the note into his hand when he became
aware that someone larger than himself was walking just behind him. the
person, whoever it was, gave a small cough, evidently as a prelude to
speaking. winston stopped abruptly and turned. it was o'brien.

at last they were face to face, and it seemed that his only impulse was
to run away. his heart bounded violently. he would have been incapable of
speaking. o'brien, however, had continued forward in the same movement,
laying a friendly hand for a moment on winston's arm, so that the two of
them were walking side by side. he began speaking with the peculiar grave
courtesy that differentiated him from the majority of inner party members.

'i had been hoping for an opportunity of talking to you,

' he said. 'i was
reading one of your newspeak articles in 'the times' the other day. you
take a scholarly interest in newspeak, i believe?'

winston had recovered part of his self-possession. 'hardly scholarly,' he
said. 'i'm only an amateur. it's not my subject. i have never had anything
to do with the actual construction of the language.'

'but you write it very elegantly,' said o'brien. 'that is not only my own
opinion. i was talking recently to a friend of yours who is certainly an
expert. his name has slipped my memory for the moment.'

again winston's heart stirred painfully. it was inconceivable that this
was anything other than a reference to syme. but syme was not only dead,
he was abolished, an unperson. any identifiable reference to him would have
been mortally dangerous. o'brien's remark must obviously have been intended
as a signal, a codeword. by sharing a small ac

t of thoughtcrime he had
turned the two of them into accomplices. they had continued to stroll
slowly down the corridor, but now o'brien halted. with the curious,
disarming friendliness that he always managed to put in to the gesture he
resettled his spectacles on his nose. then he went on:

'what i had really intended to say was that in your article i noticed you
had used two words which have become obsolete. but they have only become
so very recently. have you seen the tenth edition of the newspeak
dictionary?'

'no,' said winston. 'i didn't think it had been issued yet. we are still
using the ninth in the records department.'
 
 ___________________________
 
h so,' said winston, immediately seeing where this tended.

'some of the new developments are most ingenious. the reduction in the
number of verbs--that is the point that will appeal to you, i think. let
me see, shall i send a messenger to you with the dictionary? but i am
afraid i invariably forget anything of that kind. perhaps you could pick
it up at my flat at some time that suited you? wait. let me give you my
address.'

they were standing in front of a telescreen. somewhat absent-mindedly
o'brien felt two of his pockets and then produced a small leather-covered
notebook and a gold ink-pencil. immediately beneath the telescreen, in
such a position that anyone who was watching at the other end of the
instrument could read what he was writing, he scribbled an address, tore
out the page and handed it to winston.

'i am usually at home in the evenings,' he said. 'if not, my servant will
give you the dictionary.'

he was gone, leaving winston holding the scrap of paper, which this time
there

was no need to conceal. nevertheless he carefully memorized what was
written on it, and some hours later dropped it into the memory hole along
with a mass of other papers.

they had been talking to one another for a couple of minutes at the most.
there was only one meaning that the episode could possibly have. it had
been contrived as a way of letting winston know o'brien's address. this
was necessary, because except by direct enquiry it was never possible to
discover where anyone lived. there were no directories of any kind. 'if
you ever want to see me, this is where i can be found,' was what o'brien
had been saying to him. perhaps there would even be a message concealed
somewhere in the dictionary. but at any rate, one thing was certain. the
conspiracy that he had dreamed of did exist, and he had reached the outer
edges of it.

he knew that sooner or later he

would obey o'brien's summons. perhaps
tomorrow, perhaps after a long delay--he was not certain. what was
happening was only the working-out of a process that had started years
ago. the first step had been a secret, involuntary thought, the second
had been the opening of the diary. he had moved from thoughts to words,
and now from words to actions. the last step was something that would
happen in the ministry of love. he had accepted it. the end was contained
in the beginning. but it was frightening: or, more exac

tly, it was like
a foretaste of death, like being a little less alive. even while he was
speaking to o'brien, when the meaning of the words had sunk in, a chilly
shuddering feeling had taken possession of his body. he had the sensation
of stepping into the dampness of a grave, and it was not much better
because he had always known that the grave was there and waiting for him.

they had done it, they had done it at last!

the room they were standing in was long-shaped and softly lit. the
telescreen was dimmed to a low murmur; the richness of the dark-blue carpet
gave one the impression of treading on velvet. at the far end of the room
o'brien was sitting at a table under a green-shaded lamp, with a mass of
papers on either side of him. he had not bothered to look up when the
servant showed julia and winston in.

winston's heart was thumping so hard that he doubted whether he would be
able to speak. they had done it, they had done it at last, was all he
could think. it had been a rash act to come here at all, and sheer folly
to arrive together; though it was true that they had come by different
routes and only met on o'brien's doorst

 lived. the whole
atmosphere of the huge block of flats, the richness and spaciousness of
everything, the unfamiliar smells of good food and good tobacco, the
silent and incredibly rapid lifts sliding up and down, the white-jacketed
servants hurrying to and fro--everything was intimidating. although he had
a good pretext for coming here, he was haunted at every step by the fear
that a black-uniformed guard would suddenly appear from round the corner,
demand his papers, and order him to get out. o'brien's servant, however,
had admitted the two of them without demur. he was a small, dark-haired
man in a white jacket, with a diamond-shaped, completely expressionless
face which might have been that of a chinese. the passage down which he
led them was softly carpeted, with cream-papered walls and white
wainscoting, all exquisitely clean. that too was intimidating. winston
could not remember ever to have seen a passageway whose walls were not
grimy from the contact of human bodies.

ge.'

he rose deliberately from his chair and came towards them across the
soundless carpet. a little of the official atmosphere seemed to have fallen
away from him with the newspeak words, but his expression was grimmer than
usual, as though he were not pleased at being disturbed. the terror that
winston already felt was suddenly shot through by a streak of ordinary
embarrassment. it seemed to him quite possible that he had simply made a
stupid mistake. for what evidence had he in reality that o'brien was any
kind of political conspirator? nothing but a flash of the eyes and a single
equivocal remark: beyond that, only his own secret imaginings, founded on
a dream. he could not even fall back on the pretence that he had come to
borrow the dictionary, because in that case julia's presence was impossible
to explain. as o'brien passed the telescreen a thought seemed to strike
him. he stopped, turned aside and pressed a switch on the wall. there was
a sharp snap. the voice had stopped.

julia ut

tered a tiny sound, a sort of squeak of surprise. even in the midst
of his panic, winston was too much taken aback to be able to hold his
tongue.

'you can turn it off!' he said.

'yes,' said o'brien, 'we can turn it off. we have that privilege.'

he was opposite them now. his solid form towered over the pair of them,
and the expression on his face was still indecipherable. he was waiting,
somewhat sternly, for winston to speak, but about what? even now it was
quite conceivable that he was simply a busy man wondering irritably why he
had been interrupted. nobody spoke. after the stopping of the telescreen
the room seemed deadly silent. the seconds marched past, enormous. with

ston continued to keep his eyes fixed on o'brien's. then
suddenly the grim face broke down into what might have been the beginnings
of a smile. with his characteristic gesture o'brien resettled his
spectacles on his nose.

'shall i say it, or will you?' he said.

'i will say it,' said winston promptly. 'that thing is really turned off?'

'yes, everything is turned off. we are alone.'

'we have come here because----'

he paused, realizing for the first time the vagueness of
his own motives. since he did not in fact know what kind of
help he expected from o'brien, it was not easy to say why he
had come here. he went on, conscious that what he was saying
must sound both feeble

disbelieve in the principles of ingsoc. we are thought-criminals. we are
also adulterers. i tell you this because we want to put ourselves at your
mercy. if you want us to incriminate ourselves in any other way, we are
ready.'

he stopped and glanced over his shoulder, with the feeling that the door
had opened. sure enough, the little yellow-faced servant had come in
without knocking. winston saw that he was carrying a tray with a decanter
and glasses.

'martin is one of us,' said o'brien impassively. 'bring the drinks over
here, martin. put them on the round table. have we enough chairs? then
we may as well sit down and talk in comfort. bring a chair for yourself,
martin. this is business. you can stop being a servant for the next ten
minutes.'

the little man sat down, quite at his ease, and yet still with a
servant-like air, the air of a valet enjoying a privilege. winston
regarded him out of the corner of his eye. it struck him that the man's
whole life was playing a part, a

nd that he felt it to be dangerous to
drop his assumed personality even for a moment. o'brien took the decanter
by the neck and filled up the glasses with a dark-red liquid. it aroused
in winston dim memories of something seen long ago on a wall or a
hoarding--a vast bottle composed of electric lights which seemed to move
up and down and pour its contents into a glass. seen from the top the
stuff looked almost black, but in the decanter it gleamed like a ruby.
it had a sour-sweet smell. he saw julia pick up her glass and sniff at
it with frank curiosity.

tly.' he looked at his wrist-watch. 'it is
unwise even for members of the inner party to turn off the telescreen for
more than half an hour. you ought not to have come here together, and
you will have to leave separately. you, comrade'--he bowed his head to
julia--'will leave first. we have about twenty minutes at our disposal.
you will understand that i must start by asking you certain questions.
in general terms, what are you prepared to do?'

'anything that we are capable of,' said winston.

o'brien had turned himself a little in his chair so that he was facing
winston. he almost ignored julia, seeming to take it for granted that
winston could speak for her. for a moment the lids flitted down over his
eyes. he began asking his questions in a low, expressionless voice, as
though this were a routine, a sort of catechism, most of whose answers
were known to him already.

'you are prepared to give your lives?'

'yes.'

'you are prepared to commit murder?'

'yes.'

'to commit acts of sabotage w

'yes.'

'you are prepared, the two of you, to separate and never see one another
again?'

'no!' broke in julia.

it appeared to winston that a long time passed before he answered. for a
moment he seemed even to have been deprived of the power of speech. his
tongue worked soundlessly, forming the opening syllables first of one word,
then of the other, over and over again. until he had said it, he did not
know which word he was going to say. 'no,' he said finally.

'you did well to tell me,' said o'brien. 'it is necessary for us to know
everything.'

he turned himself toward julia and added in a voice with somewhat more
expression in it:

'do you understand that even if he survives, it may be as a different
person? we may be obliged to give him a new identity. his face, his
movements, the shape of his hands, the colour of his hair--even his voice
would be different. and you yourself might have become a different person.
our surgeons can alter people beyond recognition. sometimes it is
necessary

. sometimes we even amputate a limb.'

winston could not help snatching another sidelong glance at martin's
mongolian face. there were no scars that he could see. julia had turned a
shade paler, so that her freckles were showing, but she faced o'brien
boldly. she murmured something that seemed to be assent.

'good. then that is settled.'

there was a silver box of cigarettes on the table. with a rather
absent-minded air o'brien pushed them towards the others, took one himself,
then stood up and began to pace slowly to and fro, as though he could think
better standing. they were very good cigarettes, very thick and
well-packed, with an unfamiliar silkiness in the paper. o'brien looked at
his wrist-watch again.

'you had better go back to your pantry, martin,' he said. 'i shall switch
on in a quarter of an hour. take a good look at these comrades' faces
before you go. you will be seeing them again. i may not.'

exactly

as they had done at the front door, the little man's dark eyes
flickered over their faces. there was not a trace of friendliness in his
manner. he was memorizing their appearance, but he felt no interest in
them, or appeared to feel none. it occurred to winston that a synthetic
face was perhaps incapable of changing its expression. without speaking
or giving any kind of salutation, martin went out, closing the door
silently behind him. o'brien was strolling up and down, one hand in the
pocket of his black overalls, the other holding his cigarette.

'you understand,' he said, 'that you will be fighting in the dark. you
will always be in the dark. you will receive orders and you will obey them,
without knowing why. later i shall send you a book from which you will
learn the true nature of the society we live in, and the strategy by which
we shall destroy it. when you have read the book, you will be full members

rstanding tinged by irony. however
much in earnest he might be, he had nothing of the single-mindedness that
belongs to a fanatic. when he spoke of murder, suicide, venereal disease,
amputated limbs, and altered faces, it was with a faint air of persiflage.
'this is unavoidable,' his voice seemed to say; 'this is what we have got
to do, unflinchingly. but this is not what we shall be doing when life is
worth living again.' a wave of admiration, almost of worship, flowed out
from winston towards o'brien. for the moment he had forgotten the shadowy
figure of goldstein. when you looked at o'brien's powerful shoulders and
his blunt-featured face, so ugly and yet so civilized, it was impossible
to believe that he could be defeated. there was no stratagem that he was
not equal to, no danger that he could not foresee. even julia seemed to
be impressed. she had let her cigarette go out and was listening intently.
o'brien went on:

'you will have heard rumours of the existence of the brotherhood. no d
 
 ___________________________
 
s no other way.'

he halted and looked for the third time at his wrist-watch.

'it is almost time for you to leave, comrade,' he said to julia. 'wait.
the decanter is still half full.'

he filled the glasses and raised his own glass by the stem.

'what shall it be this time?' he said, still with the same faint
suggestion of irony. 'to the confusion of the thought police? to the
death of big brother? to humanity? to the future?'

'to the past,' said winston.

'the past is more important,' agreed o'brien gravely.

they emptied their glasses, and a moment later julia stood up to go.
o'brien took a small box from the top of a cabinet and handed her a flat
white tablet which he told her to place on her tongue. it was important,
he said, not to go out smelling of wine: the lift attendants were very
observant. as soon as the door had shut behind her he appeared to forget
her existence. he took another pace or two up and down, then stopped.

'there are details to be settled,' he said. 'i assume that

you have a
hiding-place of some kind?'

winston explained about the room over mr charrington's shop.

'that will do for the moment. later we will arrange something else for you.
it is important to change one's hiding-place frequently. meanwhile i shall
send you a copy of the book'--even o'brien, winston noticed, seemed to
pronounce the words as though they were in italics--'goldstein's book, you
understand, as soon as possible. it may be some days before i can get hold
of one. there are not many in existence, as you can imagine. the thought
police hunt them down and destroy them almost as fast as we can produce
them. it makes very little difference. the book is indestructible. if
the last copy were gone, we could reproduce it almost word for word. do

at some time during the day, in the street, a man will touch you on the
arm and say "i think you have dropped your brief-case." the one he gives
you will contain a copy of goldstein's book. you will return it within
fourteen days.'

they were silent for a moment.

'there are a couple of minutes before you need go,' said o'brien. 'we
shall meet again--if we do meet again----'

winston looked up at him. 'in the place where there is no darkness?'
he said hesitantly.

o'brien nodded without appearance of surprise. 'in the place where there
is no darkness,' he said, as though he had recognized the allusion. 'and
in the meantime, is there anything that you wish to say before you leave?
any message? any question?.'

winston thought. there did not seem to be any further question that he
wanted to ask: still less did he feel a
 
 ___________________________
 
ny impulse to utter high-sounding
generalities. instead of anything directly connected with o'brien or the
brotherhood, there came into his mind a sort of composite picture of the
dark bedroom where his mother had spent her last days, and the little room
over mr charrington's shop, and the glass paperweight, and the steel
engraving in its rosewood frame. almost at random he said:

'did you ever happen to hear an old rhyme that begins "oranges and lemons,
say the bells of st clement's"?'

again o'brien nodded. with a sort of grave courtesy he completed the
stanza:


  'oranges and lemons, say the bells of st clement's,
  you owe me three farthings, say the bells of st martin's,
  when will you pay me? say the bells of old bailey,
  when i grow rich, say the bells of shoreditch.'


'you knew the last line!' said winston.

'yes, i knew the last line. and now, i am afraid, it is time for you to go.
but wait. you had better let me give you one of these tablets.'

as winston stood up o'brien held 
 
 ___________________________
 
out a hand. his powerful grip crushed
the bones of winston's palm. at the door winston looked back, but o'brien
seemed already to be in process of putting him out of mind. he was waiting
with his hand on the switch that controlled the telescreen. beyond him
winston could see the writing-table with its green-shaded lamp and the
speakwrite and the wire baskets deep-laden with papers. the incident was
closed. within thirty seconds, it occurred to him, o'brien would be back
at his interrupted and important work on behalf of the party.




chapter 9



winston was gelatinous with fatigue. gelatinous was the right word. it had
come into his head spontaneously. his body seemed to have not only the
weakness of a jelly, but its translucency. he felt that if he held up his
hand he would be able to see the light through it. all the blood and
lymph had been drained out of him by an enormous debauch of work, leaving
only a frail structure of nerves, bones, an
 
 ___________________________
 
ith such actuality
that his heart galloped and his breath stopped. he felt the smash of
truncheons on his elbows and iron-shod boots on his shins; he saw himself
grovelling on the floor, screaming for mercy through broken teeth. he
hardly thought of julia. he could not fix his mind on her. he loved her
and would not betray her; but that was only a fact, known as he knew the
rules of arithmetic. he felt no love for her, and he hardly even wondered
what was happening to her. he thought oftener of o'brien, with a flickering
hope. o'brien might know that he had been arrested. the brotherhood, he
had said, never tried to save its members. but there was the razor blade;
they would send the razor blade if they could. there would be perhaps five
seconds before the guard could rush into the cell. the blade would bite
into him with a sort of burning coldness, and even the fingers that held
it would be cut to the bone. everything came back to his sick body, which
shrank trembling from the smallest pain.
 
 ___________________________
 
the end of it.

sometimes he tried to calculate the number of porcelain bricks in the
walls of the cell. it should have been easy, but he always lost count at
some point or another. more often he wondered where he was, and what time
of day it was. at one moment he felt certain that it was broad daylight
outside, and at the next equally certain that it was pitch darkness. in
this place, he knew instinctively, the lights would never be turned out.
it was the place with no darkness: he saw now why o'brien had seemed to
recognize the allusion. in the ministry of love there were no windows. his
cell might be at the heart of the building or against its outer wall; it
might be ten floors below ground, or thirty above it. he moved himself
mentally from place to place, and tried to determine by the feeling of his
body whether he was perched high in the air or buried deep underground.

there was a sound of marching boots outside. the steel door opened with
a clang. a young officer, a trim black-uniform
 
 ___________________________
 
 stepped into the cell. with
a brief movement of the hand he indicated ampleforth.

'room 101,' he said.

ampleforth marched clumsily out between the guards, his face vaguely
perturbed, but uncomprehending.

what seemed like a long time passed. the pain in winston's belly had
revived. his mind sagged round and round on the same trick, like a ball
falling again and again into the same series of slots. he had only six
thoughts. the pain in his belly; a piece of bread; the blood and the
screaming; o'brien; julia; the razor blade. there was another spasm in his
entrails, the heavy boots were approaching. as the door opened, the wave
of air that it created brought in a powerful smell of cold sweat. parsons
walked into the cell. he was wearing khaki shorts and a sports-shirt.

this time winston was startled into self-forgetfulness.

'you here!' he said.

parsons gave winston a glance in which there was neither interest nor
surprise, but only misery. he began walking jerkily up and down, evidently
u

at it,
but presently hunger gave way to thirst. his mouth was sticky and
evil-tasting. the humming sound and the unvarying white light induced a
sort of faintness, an empty feeling inside his head. he would get up
because the ache in his bones was no longer bearable, and then would sit
down again almost at once because he was too dizzy to make sure of
staying on his feet. whenever his physical sensations were a little under
control the terror returned. sometimes with a fading hope he thought of
o'brien and the razor blade. it was thinkable that the razor blade might
arrive concealed in his food, if he were ever fed. more dimly he thought
of julia. somewhere or other she was suffering perhaps far worse than he.
she might be screaming with pain at this moment. he thought: 'if i could
save julia by doubling my own pain, would i do it? yes, i would.' but that
was merely an intellectual decision, taken because he knew that he ought
to take it. he did not feel it. in this place you could not feel a

nything,
except pain and foreknowledge of pain. besides, was it possible, when you
were actually suffering it, to wish for any reason that your own pain
should increase? but that question was not answerable yet.

the boots were approaching again. the door opened. o'brien came in.

winston started to his feet. the shock of the sight had driven all
caution out of him. for the first time in many years he forgot the
presence of the telescreen.

'they've got you too!' he cried.

'they got me a long time ago,' said o'brien with a mild, almost regretful
irony. he stepped aside. from behind him there emerged a broad-chested
guard with a long black truncheon in his hand.

'you know this, winston,' said o'brien. 'don't deceive yourself. you did
know it--you have always k
 
 ___________________________
 
f pain you could wish only one thing: that it should stop.
nothing in the world was so bad as physical pain. in the face of pain
there are no heroes, no heroes, he thought over and over as he writhed
on the floor, clutching uselessly at his disabled left arm.




chapter 2



he was lying on something that felt like a camp bed, except that it was
higher off the ground and that he was fixed down in some way so that he
could not move. light that seemed stronger than usual was falling on his
face. o'brien was standing at his side, looking down at him intently. at
the other side of him stood a man in a white coat, holding a hypodermic
syringe.

even after his eyes were open he took in his surroundings only gradually.
he had the impression of swimming up into this room from some quite
different world, a sort of underwater world far beneath it. how long he
had been down there he did not know. since the moment when they arrested
him he had not seen darkness or daylight. besides, his memories were no

urn round. he did not look at winston
either; he was looking only at the dials.

he was rolling down a mighty corridor, a kilometre wide, full of glorious,
golden light, roaring with laughter and shouting out confessions at the
top of his voice. he was confessing everything, even the things he had
succeeded in holding back under the torture. he was relating the entire
history of his life to an audience who knew it already. with him were the
guards, the other questioners, the men in white coats, o'brien, julia,
mr charrington, all rolling down the corridor together and shouting with
laughter. some dreadful thing which had lain embedded in the future had
somehow been skipped over and had not happened. everything was all right,
there was no more pain, the last detail of his life was laid bare,
understood, forgiven.

he was starting up from the plank bed in the half-certainty that he had
heard o'brien's voice. all through his interrogation, although he had
never seen him, he had had the feeling t
 
 ___________________________
 
hat o'brien was at his elbow, just
out of sight. it was o'brien who was directing everything. it was he who
set the guards on to winston and who prevented them from killing him. it
was he who decided when winston should scream with pain, when he should
have a respite, when he should be fed, when he should sleep, when the
drugs should be pumped into his arm. it was he who asked the questions and
suggested the answers. he was the tormentor, he was the protector, he was
the inquisitor, he was the friend. and once--winston could not remember
whether it was in d
 
 ___________________________
 
rugged sleep, or in normal sleep, or even in a moment
of wakefulness--a voice murmured in his ear: 'don't worry, winston; you
are in my keeping. for seven years i have watched over you. now the
turning-point has come. i shall save you, i shall make you perfect.' he
was not sure whether it was o'brien's voice; but it was the same voice
that had said to him, 'we shall meet in the place where there is no
darkness,' in that other dream, seven years ago.

he did not remember any ending to his interrogation. there was a period of
blackness and then the cell, or room, in which he now was had gradually
materialized round him. he was almost flat on his back, and unable to move.
his body was held down at every essential point. even the back of his head
was gripped in some manner. o'brien was looking 
 
 ___________________________
 
down at him gravely and
rather sadly. his face, seen from below, looked coarse and worn, with
pouches under the eyes and tired lines from nose to chin. he was older
than winston had thought him; he was perhaps forty-eight or fifty. under
his hand there was a dial with a lever on top and figures running round
the face.

'i told you,' said o'brien, 'that if we met again it would be here.'

'yes,' said winston.

without any warning except a slight movement of o'brien's hand, a wave of
pain flooded his body. it was a frightening pain, because he could not see
what was happening, and he had the feeling that some mortal injury was
being done to him. he did not know whether the thing was really happening,
or whether the effect was electrically produced; but his body was being
wrenched out of shape, the joints were being slowly torn apart. although
the pain had brought the sweat out on his forehead, the worst of all was
the fear that his backbone was about to sn

ap. he set his teeth and
breathed hard through his nose, trying to keep silent as long as possible.

'you are afraid,' said o'brien, watching his face, 'that in another moment
something is going to break. your especial fear is that it will be your
backbone. you have a vivid mental picture of the vertebrae snapping apart
and the spinal fluid dripping out of them. that is what you are thinking,
is it not, winston?'

winston did not answer. o'brien drew back the lever on the dial. the wave
of pain receded almost as quickly as it had come.

'that was forty,' said o'brien. 'you can see that the numbers on this dial
run up to a hundred. will you please remember, throughout our conversation,
that i have it in my power to inflict pain on you at any moment and to
whatever degree i choose? if you tell me any lies, or attempt to
prevaricate in any way, or even fall below your usual level of
intelligence, you will cry out with pain, instantly. do

you understand
that?'

'yes,' said winston.

o'brien's manner became less severe. he resettled his spectacles
thoughtfully, and took a pace or two up and down. when he spoke his voice
was gentle and patient. he had the air of a doctor, a teacher, even a
priest, anxious to explain and persuade rather than to punish.

'i am taking trouble with you, winston,' he said, 'because you are worth
trouble. you know perfectly well what is the matter with you. you have
known it for years, though you have fought against the knowledge. you are
mentally derange
 
 ___________________________
 
h eastasia. good. and oceania has always been at war with eastasia,
has it not?'

winston drew in his breath. he opened his mouth to speak and then did not
speak. he could not take his eyes away from the dial.

'the truth, please, winston. your truth. tell me what you think you
remember.'

'i remember that until only a week before i was arrested, we were not at
war with eastasia at all. we were in alliance with them. the war was
against eurasia. that had lasted for four years. before that----'

o'brien stopped him with a movement of the hand.

'another example,' he said. 'some years ago you had a very serious delusion
indeed. you believed that three men, three one-time party members named
jones, aaronson, and rutherford--men who were executed for treachery and
sabotage after making the fullest possible confession--were not guilty of
the crimes they were charged with. you believed that you had seen
unmistakable documentary evidence proving that their confessions were
false. there was a certain
 
 ___________________________
 
 photograph about which you had a hallucination.
you believed that you had actually held it in your hands. it was a
photograph something like this.'

an oblong slip of newspaper had appeared between o'brien's fingers. for
perhaps five seconds it was within the angle of winston's vision. it was
a photograph, and there was no question of its identity. it was the
photograph. it was another copy of the photograph of jones, aaronson, and
rutherford at the party function in new york, which he had chanced upon
eleven years ago and promptly destroyed. for only an instant it was before
his eyes, then it was out of sight again. but he had seen it,
unquestionably he had seen it! he made a desperate, agonizin
 
 ___________________________
 
g effort to
wrench the top half of his body free. it was impossible to move so much as
a centimetre in any direction. for the moment he had even forgotten the
dial. all he wanted was to hold the photograph in his fingers again, or at
least to see it.

'it exists!' he cried.

'no,' said o'brien.

he stepped across the room. there was a memory hole in the opposite wall.
o'brien lifted the grating. unseen, the frail slip of paper was whirling
away on the current of warm air; it was vanishing in a flash of flame.
o'brien turned away from the wall.

'ashes,' he said. 'not even identifiable ashes. dust. it does not exist.
it never existed.'

'but it did exist! it does exist! it exists in memory. i remember it.
you remember it.'

'i do not remember it,' said o'brien.

winston's heart sank. that was doublethink. he had a feeling of deadly
helplessness. if he could have been
 
 ___________________________
 
 certain that o'brien was lying, it
would not have seemed to matter. but it was perfectly possible that o'brien
had really forgotten the photograph. and if so, then already he would have
forgotten his denial of remembering it, and forgotten the act of
forgetting. how could one be sure that it was simple trickery? perhaps
that lunatic dislocation in the mind could really happen: that was the
thought that defeated him.

o'brien was looking down at him speculatively. more than ever he had the
air of a teacher taking pains with a wayward but promising child.

'there is a party slogan dealing with the control of the past,' he said.
'repeat it, if you please.'

'"who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present
controls the past,"' repeated winston obediently.

'"who controls the present controls the past,"' said o'brien, nodding his
head with slow approval. 'is it your opinion, winston, that the past h
 
 ___________________________
 
as
real existence?'

again the feeling of helplessness descended upon winston. his eyes flitted
towards the dial. he not only did not know whether 'yes' or 'no' was the
answer that would save him from pain; he did not even know which answer he
believed to be the true one.

o'brien smiled faintly. 'you are no metaphysician, winston,' he said.
'until this moment you had never considered what is meant by existence. i
will put it more precisely. does the past exist concretely, in space? is
there somewhere or other a place, a world of solid objects, where the past
is still happening?'

'no.'

'then where does the past exist, if at all?'

'in records. it is written down.'

'in records. and----?'

'in the mind. in human memories.'

'in memory. very well, then. we, the party, co
 
 ___________________________
 
ntrol all records, and we
control all memories. then we control the past, do we not?'

'but how can you stop people remembering things?' cried winston again
momentarily forgetting the dial. 'it is involuntary. it is outside oneself.
how can you control memory? you have not controlled mine!'

o'brien's manner grew stern again. he laid his hand on the dial.

'on the contrary,' he said, 'you have not controlled it. that is what has
brought you here. you are here because you have failed in humility, in
self-discipline. you would not make the act of submission which is the
price of sanity. you preferred to be a lunatic, a minority of one. only the
disciplined mind can see reality, winston. you believe that reality is
something objective, external, existing in its own right. you also believe
tha
 
 ___________________________
 
e the truth, is truth. it is impossible to see reality except by
looking through the eyes of the party. that is the fact that you have got
to relearn, winston. it needs an act of self-destruction, an effort of the
will. you must humble yourself before you can become sane.'

he paused for a few moments, as though to allow what he had been saying to
sink in.

'do you remember,' he went on, 'writing in your diary, "freedom is the
freedom to say that two plus two make four"?'

'yes,' said winston.

o'brien held up his left hand, its back towards winston, with the thumb
hidden and the four fingers extended.

'how many fingers am i holding up, winston?'

'four.'

'and if the party says that it is not four but five--then how many?'

'four.'

the word ended in a gasp of pain. the needle of the dial had shot up to
fifty-five. the sweat had sprung out all over winston's body. the air tore
into his lungs and issued again in deep groans which even by clenching his
teeth he could not stop. o'brien watched
 
 ___________________________
 
d the four fingers filled his vision. the fingers stood up
before his eyes like pillars, enormous, blurry, and seeming to vibrate,
but unmistakably four.

'how many fingers, winston?'

'four! stop it, stop it! how can you go on? four! four!'

'how many fingers, winston?'

'five! five! five!'

'no, winston, that is no use. you are lying. you still think there are
four. how many fingers, please?'

'four! five! four! anything you like. only stop it, stop the pain!'

abruptly he was sitting up with o'brien's arm round his shoulders. he had
perhaps lost consciousness for a few seconds. the bonds that had held his
body down were loosened. he felt very cold, he was shaking uncontrollably,
his teeth were chattering, the tears were rolling down his cheeks. for a
moment he clung to o'brien like a baby, curiously comforted by the heavy
arm round his shoulders. he had the feeling that o'brien was his protector,
that the pain was something that came from outside, from some other source,
and that it was o'
 
 ___________________________
 
brien who would save him from it.

'you are a slow learner, winston,' said o'brien gently.

'how can i help it?' he blubbered. 'how can i help seeing what is in front
of my eyes? two and two are four.'

'sometimes, winston. sometimes they are five. sometimes they are three.
sometimes they are all of them at once. you must try harder. it is not
easy to become sane.'

he laid winston down on the bed. the grip of his limbs tightened again,
but the pain had ebbed away and the trembling had stopped, leaving him
merely weak and cold. o'brien motioned with his head to the man in the
 
 ___________________________
 

white coat, who had stood immobile throughout the proceedings. the man in
the white coat bent down and looked closely into winston's eyes, felt his
pulse, laid an ear against his chest, tapped here and there, then he
nodded to o'brien.

'again,' said o'brien.

the pain flowed into winston's body. the needle must be at seventy,
seventy-five. he had shut his eyes this time. he knew that the fingers
were still there, and still four. all that mattered was somehow to stay
alive until the spasm was over. he had ceased to notice whether he was
crying out or not. the pain lessened again. he opened his eyes. o'brien
had drawn back the lever.

'how many fingers, winston?'

'four. i suppose there are four. i would see five if i could. i am trying
to see five.
 
 ___________________________
 
'

'which do you wish: to persuade me that you see five, or really to see
them?'

'really to see them.'

'again,' said o'brien.

perhaps the needle was eighty--ninety. winston could not intermittently
remember why the pain was happening. behind his screwed-up eyelids a
forest of fingers seemed to be moving in a sort of dance, weaving in and
out, disappearing behind one another and reappearing again. he was trying
to count them, he could not remember why. he knew only that it was
impossible to count them, and that this was somehow due to the mysterious
identity between five and four. the pain died down again. when he op
 
 ___________________________
 
ened
his eyes it was to find that he was still seeing the same thing.
innumerable fingers, like moving trees, were still streaming past in
either direction, crossing and recrossing. he shut his eyes again.

'how many fingers am i holding up, winston?'

'i don't know. i don't know. you will kill me if you do that again. four,
five, six--in all honesty i don't know.'

'better,' said o'brien.

a needle slid into winston's arm. almost in the same instant a blissful,
healing warmth spread all through his body. the pain was already
half-forgotten. he opened his eyes and looked up gratefully at o'brien.
at sight of the heavy, lined face, so ugly and so intelligent, his heart
seemed to turn over. if he could have moved he would have stretched out
a hand and laid it on o'brien's arm. he had never loved him so deeply as
at this moment, and not merely because he had stopped the pain. the o
 
 ___________________________
 
ld
feeling, that at bottom it did not matter whether o'brien was a friend
or an enemy, had come back. o'brien was a person who could be talked to.
perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood. o'brien
had tortured him to the edge of lunacy, and in a little while, it was
certain, he would send him to his death. it made no difference. in some
sense that went deeper than friendship, they were intimates: somewhere or
other, although the actual words might never be spoken, there was a place
where they could meet and talk. o'brien was looking down at him with an
expression which suggested that the same thought might be in his own mind.
when he spoke it was in an easy, conversational tone.

'do you
 
 ___________________________
 
 know where you are, winston?' he said.

'i don't know. i can guess. in the ministry of love.'

'do you know how long you have been here?'

'i don't know. days, weeks, months--i think it is months.'

'and why do you imagine that we bring people to this place?'

'to make them confess.'

'no, that is not the reason. try again.'

'to punish them.'

'no!' exclaimed o'brien. his voice had changed extraordinarily, and his
face had suddenly become both stern and animated. 'no! not merely to
extract your confession, not to punish you. shall i tell you why we have
brought you here? to cure you! to make you sane! will you understand,
winston, that no one whom we bring to this place ever leaves our hands
uncured? we are not interested in those stupid crimes that you have
committed. the party is not interested in the overt act: the thought is
all we care about. we do not
 
 ___________________________
 
 merely destroy our enemies, we change them.
do you understand what i mean by that?'

he was bending over winston. his face looked enormous because of its
nearness, and hideously ugly because it was seen from below. moreover it
was filled with a sort of exaltation, a lunatic intensity. again winston's
heart shrank. if it had been possible he would have cowered deeper into
the bed. he felt certain that o'brien was about to twist the dial out of
sheer wantonness. at this moment, however, o'brien turned away. he took a
pace or two up and down. then he continued less vehemently:

'the first thing for you to understand is that in this place there are no
martyrdoms. you have read of the religious persecutions of the past. in
the middle ages there was the inquisition. it was a failure. it set out
to eradicate heresy, and ended by perpetuating it. for every heretic it
burned at the stake, thousands of others rose up. why was that? because
the inquisition killed its enemies in the open, and k

o rise up against us.
you must stop imagining that posterity will vindicate you, winston.
posterity will never hear of you. you will be lifted clean out from the
stream of history. we shall turn you into gas and pour you into the
stratosphere. nothing will remain of you, not a name in a register, not
a memory in a living brain. you will be annihilated in the past as well
as in the future. you will never have existed.'

then why bother to torture me? thought winston, with a momentary
bitterness. o'brien checked his step as though winston had uttered the
thought aloud. his large ugly face came nearer, with the eyes a little
narrowed.

'you are thinking,' he said, 'that since we intend to destroy you utterly,
so that nothing that you say or do can make the smallest difference--in
that case, why do we go to the trouble of interrogating you first? that is
what you were thinking, was it not?'

'yes,' said winston.

o'brien smiled slightly. 'you are a flaw in the pattern, winston. you are
a stain th

how they loved him. they begged to be shot quickly, so that they could die
while their minds were still clean.'

his voice had grown almost dreamy. the exaltation, the lunatic enthusiasm,
was still in his face. he is not pretending, thought winston, he is not a
hypocrite, he believes every word he says. what most oppressed him was the
consciousness of his own intellectual inferiority. he watched the heavy
yet graceful form strolling to and fro, in and out of the range of his
vision. o'brien was a being in all ways larger than himself. there was no
idea that he had ever had, or could have, that o'brien had not long ago
known, examined, and rejected. his mind contained winston's mind. but
in that case how could it be true that o'brien was mad? it must be he,
winston, who was mad. o'brien halted and looked down at him. his voice had
grown stern again.

'do not imagine that you will save yourself, winston, however completely
you surrender to us. no one who has once gone astray is ever

t recover, if you lived a thousand years. never again will you be
capable of ordinary human feeling. everything will be dead inside you.
never again will you be capable of love, or friendship, or joy of living,
or laughter, or curiosity, or courage, or integrity. you will be hollow.
we shall squeeze you empty, and then we shall fill you with ourselves.'

he paused and signed to the man in the white coat. winston was aware of
some heavy piece of apparatus being pushed into place behind his head.
o'brien had sat down beside the bed, so that his face was almost on a
level with winston's.

'three thousand,' he said, speaking over winston's head to the man in the
white coat.

two soft pads, which felt slightly moist, clamped themselves against
winston's temples. he quailed. there was pain coming, a new kind of pain.
o'brien laid a hand reassuringly, almost kindly, on his.

'this time it will not hurt,' he said. 'keep your eyes fixed on mine.'

at this moment there was a devastating explosion, or w

ough he had already been lying on his back when the thing
happened, he had a curious feeling that he had been knocked into that
position. a terrific painless blow had flattened him out. also something
had happened inside his head. as his eyes regained their focus he
remembered who he was, and where he was, and recognized the face that was
gazing into his own; but somewhere or other there was a large patch of
emptiness, as though a piece had been taken out of his brain.

'it will not last,' said o'brien. 'look me in the eyes. what country is
oceania at war with?'

winston thought. he knew what was meant by oceania and that he himself was
a citizen of oceania. he also remembered eurasia and eastasia; but who was
at war with whom he did not know. in fact he had not been aware that there
was any war.

'i don't remember.'

'oceania is at war with eastasia. do you remember that now?'

'yes.'

'oceania has always been at war with eastasia. since the beginning of your
life, since the beginning of the

'yes.'

'eleven years ago you created a legend about three men who had been
condemned to death for treachery. you pretended that you had seen a piece
of paper which proved them innocent. no such piece of paper ever existed.
you invented it, and later you grew to believe in it. you remember now the
very moment at which you first invented it. do you remember that?'

'yes.'

'just now i held up the fingers of my hand to you. you saw five fingers.
do you remember that?'

'yes.'

o'brien held up the fingers of his left hand, with the thumb concealed.

'there are five fingers there. do you see five fingers?'

'yes.'

and he did see them, for a fleeting instant, before the scenery of his
mind changed. he saw five fingers, and there was no deformity. then
everything was normal again, and the old fear, the hatred, and the
bewilderment came crowding back again. but there had been a moment--he did
not know how long, thirty seconds, perhaps--of luminous certainty, when
each new sugges

tion of o'brien's had filled up a patch of emptiness and
become absolute truth, and when two and two could have been three as
easily as five, if that were what was needed. it had faded but before
o'brien had dropped his hand; but though he could not recapture it, he
could remember it, as one remembers a vivid experience at some period of
one's life when one was in effect a different person.

'you see now,' said o'brien, 'that it is at any rate possible.'

'yes,' said winston.

o'brien stood up with a satisfied air. over to his left winston saw the
man in the white coat break an ampoule and draw back the plunger of a
syringe. o'brien turned to winston with a smile. in almost the old manner
he resettled his spectacles on his nose.

'do you remember writing in your diary,' he said, 'that it did not matter
whether i was a friend or an enemy, since i was at least a person who
understood you and could be talked to? you were right. i enjoy talking to
you. your mind appeals to me. i

t resembles my own mind except that you
happen to be insane. before we bring the session to an end you can ask me
a few questions, if you choose.'

'any question i like?'

'anything.' he saw that winston's eyes were upon the dial. 'it is switched
off. what is your first question?'

'what have you done with julia?' said winston.

o'brien smiled again. 'she betrayed you, winston. immediately--unreservedly.
i have seldom seen anyone come over to us so promptly. you would hardly
recognize her if you saw her. all her rebelliousness, her deceit, her
folly, her dirty-mindedness--everything has been burned out of her. it was
a perfect conversion, a textbook case.'

'you tortured her?'

o'brien left this unanswered. 'next question,' he said.

'does big brother exist?'

'of course he exists. the party exists. big brother is the embodime
 
 ___________________________
 
nt of
the party.'

'does he exist in the same way as i exist?'

'you do not exist,' said o'brien.

once again the sense of helplessness assailed him. he knew, or he could
imagine, the arguments which proved his own nonexistence; but they were
nonsense, they were only a play on words. did not the statement, 'you do
not exist', contain a logical absurdity? but what use was it to say so?
his mind shrivelled as he thought of the unanswerable, mad arguments with
which o'brien would demolish him.

'i think i exist,' he said wearily. 'i am conscious of my own identity.
i was born and i shall die. i have arms and legs. i occupy a particular
point in space. no other solid object can occupy the same point
simultaneously. in that sense, does big brother exist?'

'it is of no importance. he exists.'

'will big brother ever die?'

'of course not. how could he die? next question.'

'does the brotherhood exist?'

'that, winston, you will never know. if we choose to set you fr

ee when we
have finished with you, and if you live to be ninety years old, still you
will never learn whether the answer to that question is yes or no. as long
as you live it will be an unsolved riddle in your mind.'

winston lay silent. his breast rose and fell a little faster. he still had
not asked the question that had come into his mind the first. he had got
to ask it, and yet it was as though his tongue would not utter it. there
was a trace of amusement in o'brien's face. even his spectacles seemed to
wear an ironical gleam. he knows, thought winston suddenly, he knows what
i am going to ask! at the thought the words burst out of him:

'what is in room 101?'

the expression on o'brien's face did not change. he answered drily:

'you know what is in room 101, winston. everyone knows what is in
room 101.'

he raised a finger to the man in the white coat. evidently the session was
at an end. a needle jerked into winston's arm. he sank almost instantly
into d

chapter 3



'there are three stages in your reintegration,' said o'brien. 'there is
learning, there is understanding, and there is acceptance. it is time for
you to enter upon the second stage.'

as always, winston was lying flat on his back. but of late his bonds were
looser. they still held him to the bed, but he could move his knees a
little and could turn his head from side to side and raise his arms from
the elbow. the dial, also, had grown to be less of a terror. he could
evade its pangs if he was quick-witted enough: it was chiefly when he
showed stupidity th

at o'brien pulled the lever. sometimes they got through
a whole session without use of the dial. he could not remember how many
sessions there had been. the whole process seemed to stretch out over a
long, indefinite time--weeks, possibly--and the intervals between the
sessions might sometimes have been days, sometimes only an hour or two.

'as you lie there,' said o'brien, 'you have often wondered--you have even
asked me--why the ministry of love should expend so much time and trouble
on you. and when you were free you were puzzled by what was essentially
the same question. you could grasp the mechanics of the society you lived
in, but not its underlying motives. do you remember writing in your diary,
"i understand how: i do not understand why"? it was when you thought about
"why" that you doubted your own sanity. you have read the book,
goldstein's book, or par
 
 ___________________________
 
oint of your thoughts.'

he came closer to the bed. 'for ever!' he repeated. 'and now let us get
back to the question of "how" and "why". you understand well enough how
the party maintains itself in power. now tell me why we cling to power.
what is our motive? why should we want power? go on, speak,' he added as
winston remained silent.

nevertheless winston did not speak for another moment or two. a feeling of
weariness had overwhelmed him. the faint, mad gleam of enthusiasm had come
back into o'brien's face. he knew in advance what o'brien would say. that
the party did not seek power for its own ends, but only for the good of
the majority. that it sought power because men in the mass were frail,
cowardly creatures who could not endure liberty or face the truth, and
must be ruled over and systematically deceived by others who were stronger
than themselves. that the choice for mankind lay between freedom and
happiness, and that, for the great bulk of mankind, happiness was better.
that the pa

rty was the eternal guardian of the weak, a dedicated sect
doing evil that good might come, sacrificing its own happiness to that of
others. the terrible thing, thought winston, the terrible thing was that
when o'brien said this he would believe it. you could see it in his face.
o'brien knew everything. a thousand times better than winston he knew what
the world was really like, in what degradation the mass of human beings
lived and by what lies and barbarities the party kept them there. he had
understood it all, weighed it all, and it made no difference: all was
justified by the ultimate purpose. what can you do, thought winston,
against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself, who gives your
arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy?

'you are
 
 ___________________________
 
 ruling over us for our own good,' he said feebly. 'you believe
that human beings are not fit to govern themselves, and therefore----'

he started and almost cried out. a pang of pain had shot through his body.
o'brien had pushed the lever of the dial up to thirty-five.

'that was stupid, winston, stupid!' he said. 'you should know better than
to say a thing like that.'

he pulled the lever back and continued:

'now i will tell you the answer to my question. it is this. the party
seeks power entirely for its own sake. we are not interested in the good
of others; we are interested solely in power. not wealth or luxury or long
life or happiness: only power, pure power. what pure power means you will
understand 
 
 ___________________________
 
 and equal. we are not like that. we know that
no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. power is
not a means, it is an end. one does not establish a dictatorship in order
to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish
the dictatorship. the object of persecution is persecution. the object of
torture is torture. the object of power is power. now do you begin to
understand me?'

winston was struck, as he had been struck before, by the tiredness of
o'brien's face. it was strong and fleshy and brutal, it was full of
intelligence and a sort of controlled passion before which he felt himself
helpless; but it was tired. there were pouches under the eyes, the skin
sagged from the cheekbones. o'brien leaned over him, deliberately bringing
the worn face nearer.

'you are thinking,' he said, 'that my face is old and tired. you are
thinking that i talk of power, and yet i am not even able to prevent the
decay of my own body. can you not understand, winsto
 
 ___________________________
 
r over human beings. over the body--but, above
all, over the mind. power over matter--external reality, as you would call
it--is not important. already our control over matter is absolute.'

for a moment winston ignored the dial. he made a violent effort to raise
himself into a sitting position, and merely succeeded in wrenching his
body painfully.

'but how can you control matter?' he burst out. 'you don't even control
the climate or the law of gravity. and there are disease, pain, death----'

o'brien silenced him by a movement of his hand. 'we control matter because
we control the mind. reality is inside the skull. you will learn by
degrees, winston. there is nothing that we could not do. invisibility,
levitation--anything. i could float off this floor like a soap bubble if
i wish to. i do not wish to, because the party does not wish it. you must
get rid of those nineteenth-century ideas about the laws of nature. we
make the laws of nature.'

'but you do not! you are not even masters of thi

mals--mammoths and
mastodons and enormous reptiles which lived here long before man was ever
heard of.'

'have you ever seen those bones, winston? of course not. nineteenth-century
biologists invented them. before man there was nothing. after man, if he
could come to an end, there would be nothing. outside man there is
nothing.'

'but the whole universe is outside us. look at the stars! some of them are
a million light-years away. they are out of our reach for ever.'

'what are the stars?' said o'brien indifferently. 'they are bits of fire
a few kilometres away. we could reach them if we wanted to. or we could
blot them out. the earth is the centre of the universe. the sun and the
stars go round it.'

winston made another convulsive movement. this time he did not say
anything. o'brien continued as though answering a spoken objection:

'for certain purposes, of course, that is not true. when we navigate the
ocean, or when we predict an eclipse, we often find it convenient to
assume that the ea

. do you suppose our mathematicians
are unequal to that? have you forgotten doublethink?'

winston shrank back upon the bed. whatever he said, the swift answer
crushed him like a bludgeon. and yet he knew, he knew, that he was in the
right. the belief that nothing exists outside your own mind--surely there
must be some way of demonstrating that it was false? had it not been
exposed long ago as a fallacy? there was even a name for it, which he
had forgotten. a faint smile twitched the corners of o'brien's mouth as
he looked down at him.

'i told you, winston,' he said, 'that metaphysics is not your strong
point. the word you are trying to think of is solipsism. but you are
mistaken. this is not solipsism. collective solipsism, if you like. but
that is a different thing: in fact, the opposite thing. all this is a
digression,' he added in a different tone. 'the real power, the power we
have to fight for night and day, is not power over things, but over men.'
he paused, and for a moment assumed a

his, winston--always there will be
the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing
subtler. always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory,
the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. if you want a
picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face--for ever.'

he paused as though he expected winston to speak. winston had tried to
shrink back into the surface of the bed again. he could not say anything.
his heart seemed to be frozen. o'brien went on:

'and remember that it is for ever. the face will always be there to be
stamped upon. the heretic, the enemy of society, will always be there, so
that he can be defeated and humiliated over again. everything that you
have undergone since you have been in our hands--all that will continue,
and worse. the espionage, the betrayals, the arrests, the tortures, the
executions, the disappearances will never cease. it will be a world of
terror as much as a world of triumph. the more the party

 that hatred is more exhausting
than love. why should it be? and if it were, what difference would that
make? suppose that we choose to wear ourselves out faster. suppose that we
quicken the tempo of human life till men are senile at thirty. still what
difference would it make? can you not understand that the death of the
individual is not death? the party is immortal.'

as usual, the voice had battered winston into helplessness. moreover he
was in dread that if he persisted in his disagreement o'brien would twist
the dial again. and yet he could not keep silent. feebly, without
arguments, with nothing to support him except his inarticulate horror of
what o'brien had said, he returned to the attack.

'i don't know--i don't care. somehow you will fail. something will defeat
you. life will defeat you.'

'we control life, winston, at all its levels. you are imagining that there
is something called human nature which will be outraged by what we do and
will turn against us. but we create human nat

ston?'

'no.'

'then what is it, this principle that will defeat us?'

'i don't know. the spirit of man.'

'and do you consider yourself a man?'

'yes.'

'if you are a man, winston, you are the last man. your kind is extinct; we
are the inheritors. do you understand that you are alone? you are outside
history, you are non-existent.' his manner changed and he said more
harshly: 'and you consider yourself morally superior to us, with our lies
and our cruelty?'

'yes, i consider myself superior.'

o'brien did not speak. two other voices were speaking. after a moment
winston recognized one of them as his own. it was a sound-track of the
conversation he had had with o'brien, on the night when he had enrolled
himself in the brotherhood. he heard himself promising to lie, to steal,
to forge, to murder, to encourage drug-taking and prostitution, to
disseminate venereal diseases, to throw vitriol in a child's face. o'brien
made a small impatient gesture, as though to say that the demonstration
was har

dly worth making. then he turned a switch and the voices stopped.

'get up from that bed,' he said.

the bonds had loosened themselves. winston lowered himself to the floor
and stood up unsteadily.

'you are the last man,' said o'brien. 'you are the guardian of the human
spirit. you shall see yourself as you are. take off your clothes.'

winston undid the bit of string that held his overalls together. the zip
fastener had long since been wrenched out of them. he could not remember
whether at any time since his arrest he had taken off all his clothes at
one time. beneath the overalls his body was looped with filthy yellowish
rags, just recognizable as the remnants of underclothes. as he slid
them to the ground he saw that ther

e was a three-sided mirror at the far
end of the room. he approached it, then stopped short. an involuntary cry
had broken out of him.

'go on,' said o'brien. 'stand between the wings of the mirror. you shall
see the side view as well.'

he had stopped because he was frightened. a bowed, grey-coloured,
skeleton-like thing was coming towards him. its actual appearance was
frightening, and not merely the fact that he knew it to be himself. he
moved closer to the glass. the creature's face seemed to be protruded,
because of its bent carriage. a forlorn, jailbird's face with a nobby
forehead running back into a bald scalp, a crooked nose, and
battered-l

y the scalp that was
grey. except for his hands and a circle of his face, his body was grey all
over with ancient, ingrained dirt. here and there under the dirt there
were the red scars of wounds, and near the ankle the varicose ulcer was an
inflamed mass with flakes of skin peeling off it. but the truly frightening
thing was the emaciation of his body. the barrel of the ribs was as narrow
as that of a skeleton: the legs had shrunk so that the knees were thicker
than the thighs. he saw now what o'brien had meant about seeing the side
view. the curvature of the spine was astonishing. the thin shoulders were
hunched forward so as to make a cavity of the chest, the scraggy neck
seemed to be bending double under the weight of the skull. at a guess he
would have said that it was the body of a man of sixty, suffering from
some malignant disease.

'you have thought sometimes,' said o'brien, 'that my face--the face of a
member of the inner party--looks old and worn. what do you think of your
own face

 carrot. do you know that you have lost twenty-five
kilograms since you have been in our hands? even your hair is coming out
in handfuls. look!' he plucked at winston's head and brought away a tuft
of hair. 'open your mouth. nine, ten, eleven teeth left. how many had you
when you came to us? and the few you have left are dropping out of your
head. look here!'

he seized one of winston's remaining front teeth between his powerful
thumb and forefinger. a twinge of pain shot through winston's jaw. o'brien
had wrenched the loose tooth out by the roots. he tossed it across the
cell.

'you are rotting away,' he said; 'you are falling to pieces. what are you?
a bag of filth. now turn around and look into that mirror again. do you
see that thing facing you? that is the last man. if you are human, that is
humanity. now put your clothes on again.'

winston began to dress himself with slow stiff movements. until now he had
not seemed to notice how thin and weak he was. only one thought stirred in
his mi
 
 ___________________________
 
nd: that he must have been in this place longer than he had imagined.
then suddenly as he fixed the miserable rags round himself a feeling of
pity for his ruined body overcame him. before he knew what he was doing
he had collapsed on to a small stool that stood beside the bed and burst
into tears. he was aware of his ugliness, his gracelessness, a bundle of
bones in filthy underclothes sitting weeping in the harsh white light: but
he could not stop himself. o'brien laid a hand on his shoulder, almost
kindly.

'it will not last for ever,' he said. 'you can escape from it whenever you
choose. everything depends on yourself.'

'you did it!' sobbed winston. 'you reduced me to this state.'

'no, winston, you reduced yourself to it. this is what you accepted when
you set yourself up against the party. it was all contained in that first
act. nothing has happened that you did not foresee.'

he paused, and then went on:

'we have beaten you, winston. we have broke

p. you have seen what
your body is like. your mind is in the same state. i do not think there
can be much pride left in you. you have been kicked and flogged and
insulted, you have screamed with pain, you have rolled on the floor in
your own blood and vomit. you have whimpered for mercy, you have betrayed
everybody and everything. can you think of a single degradation that has
not happened to you?'

winston had stopped weeping, though the tears were still oozing out of his
eyes. he looked up at o'brien.

'i have not betrayed julia,' he said.

o'brien looked down at him thoughtfully. 'no,' he said; 'no; that is
perfectly true. you have not betrayed julia.'

the peculiar reverence for o'brien, which nothing seemed able to destroy,
flooded winston's heart again. how intelligent, he thought, how
intelligent! never did o'brien fail to understand what was said to him.
anyone else on earth would have answered promptly that he had betrayed
julia. for what was there that they had not screwed out of hi

torture? he had told them everything he knew about her, her habits, her
character, her past life; he had confessed in the most trivial detail
everything that had happened at their meetings, all that he had said to
her and she to him, their black-market meals, their adulteries, their
vague plottings against the party--everything. and yet, in the sense in
which he intended the word, he had not betrayed her. he had not stopped
loving her; his feelings towards her had remained the same. o'brien had
seen what he meant without the need for explanation.

'tell me,' he said, 'how soon will they shoot me?'

'it might be a long time,' said o'brien. 'you are a difficult case. but
don't give up hope. everyone is cured sooner or later. in the end we shall
shoot you.'

was proper to speak of days.

was a little more comfortable than th

ne meal to the next almost
without stirring, sometimes asleep, sometimes waking into vague reveries
in which it was too much trouble to open his eyes. he had long grown
used to sleeping with a strong light on his face. it seemed to make no
difference, except that one's dreams were more coherent. he dreamed a
great deal all through this time, and they were always happy dreams. he
was in the golden country, or he was sitting among enormous glorious,
sunlit ruins, with his mother, with julia, with o'brien--not doing
anything, merely sitting in the sun, talking of peaceful things. such
thoughts as he had when he was awake were mostly about his dreams. he
seemed to have lost the power of intellectual effort, now that the
stimulus of pain had been removed. he was not bored, he had no desire
for conversation or distraction. merely to be alone, not to be beaten
or questioned, to have enough to eat, and to be clean all over, was
completely satisfying.

by degrees he came to spend less time in sleep, b

render, and everything else
followed. it was like swimming against a current that swept you backwards
however hard you struggled, and then suddenly deciding to turn round and
go with the current instead of opposing it. nothing had changed except
your own attitude: the predestined thing happened in any case. he hardly
knew why he had ever rebelled. everything was easy, except----!

anything could be true. the so-called laws of nature were nonsense. the
law of gravity was nonsense. 'if i wished,' o'brien had said, 'i could
float off this floor like a soap bubble.' winston worked it out. 'if he
thinks he floats off the floor, and if i simultaneously think i see him
do it, then the thing happens.' suddenly, like a lump of submerged wreckage
breaking the surface of water, the thought burst into his mind: 'it doesn't
really happen. we imagine it. it is hallucination.' he pushed the thought
under instantly. the fallacy was obvious. it presupposed that somewhere
or other, outside oneself, there was a

. the arithmetical
problems raised, for instance, by such a statement as 'two and two make
five' were beyond his intellectual grasp. it needed also a sort of
athleticism of mind, an ability at one moment to make the most delicate
use of logic and at the next to be unconscious of the crudest logical
errors. stupidity was as necessary as intelligence, and as difficult to
attain.

all the while, with one part of his mind, he wondered how soon they would
shoot him. 'everything depends on yourself,' o'brien had said; but he knew
that there was no conscious act by which he could bring it nearer. it
might be ten minutes hence, or ten years. they might keep him for years in
solitary confinement, they might send him to a labour-camp, they might
release him for a while, as they sometimes did. it was perfectly possible
that before he was shot the whole drama of his arrest and interrogation
would be enacted all over again. the one certain thing was that death
never came at an expected moment. the traditi

let such an outburst go unpunished. they would know now, if they had not
known before, that he was breaking the agreement he had made with them.
he obeyed the party, but he still hated the party. in the old days he had
hidden a heretical mind beneath an appearance of conformity. now he had
retreated a step further: in the mind he had surrendered, but he had hoped
to keep the inner heart inviolate. he knew that he was in the wrong, but
he preferred to be in the wrong. they would understand that--o'brien would
understand it. it was all confessed in that single foolish cry.

he would have to start all over again. it might take years. he ran a hand
over his face, trying to familiarize himself with the new shape. there
were deep furrows in the cheeks, the cheekbones felt sharp, the nose
flattened. besides, since last seeing himself in the glass he had been
given a complete new set of teeth. it was not easy to preserve
inscrutability when you did not know what your face looked like. in any

had got to plunge into the filthiest of filth. what was the most horrible,
sickening thing of all? he thought of big brother. the enormous face
(because of constantly seeing it on posters he always thought of it as
being a metre wide), with its heavy black moustache and the eyes that
followed you to and fro, seemed to float into his mind of its own accord.
what were his true feelings towards big brother?

there was a heavy tramp of boots in the passage. the steel door swung open
with a clang. o'brien walked into the cell. behind him were the waxen-faced
officer and the black-uniformed guards.

'get up,' said o'brien. 'come here.'

winston stood opposite him. o'brien took winston's shoulders between his
strong hands and looked at him closely.

'you have had thoughts of deceiving me,' he said. 'that was stupid.

he paused, and went on in a gentler tone:

'you are improving. intellectually there is very little wrong with you.

you must love big brother. it is not enough to obey him: you must love
him.'

he released winston with a little push towards the guards.

'room 101,' he said.




chapter 5



at each stage of his imprisonment he had known, or seemed to know,
whereabouts he was in the windowless building. possibly there were slight
differences in the air pressure. the cells where the guards had beaten him
were below ground level. the room where he had been interrogated by
o'brien was high up near the roof. this place was many metres underground,
as deep down as it was possible to go.

it was bigger than most of the cells he had been in. but he hardly noticed
his surroundings. all he noticed was that there were two small tables
straight in front of him, each covered with green baize. one was only a
metre or two from him, the other was further away, near the door. he was
strapped upright in a chair, so tightly that he could move nothing, not
even his head. a sort of pad g

ripped his head from behind, forcing him to
look straight in front of him.

for a moment he was alone, then the door opened and o'brien came in.

'you asked me once,' said o'brien, 'what was in room 101. i told you that
you knew the answer already. everyone knows it. the thing that is in
room 101 is the worst thing in the world.'

the door opened again. a guard came in, carrying something made of wire,
a box or basket of some kind. he set it down on the further table. because
of the position in which o'brien was standing. winston could not see what
the thing was.

'the worst thing in the world,' said o'brien, 'varies from individual to
individual. it may be burial alive,

 not even fatal.'

he had moved a little to one side, so that winston had a better view of
the thing on the table. it was an oblong wire cage with a handle on top
for carrying it by. fixed to the front of it was something that looked
like a fencing mask, with the concave side outwards. although it was three
or four metres away from him, he could see that the cage was divided
lengthways into two compartments, and that there was some kind of creature
in each. they were rats.

'in your case,' said o'brien, 'the worst thing in the world happens to be
rats.'

a sort of premonitory tremor, a fear of he was not certain what, had
passed through winston as soon as he caught his first glimpse of the cage.
but at this moment the meaning of the mask-like attachment in front of it
suddenly sank into him. his bowels seemed to turn to water.

'you can't do that!' he cried out in a high cracked voice. 'you couldn't,
you couldn't! it's impossible.'

'do you remember,' said o'brien, 'the moment of panic that u

sed to occur
in your dreams? there was a wall of blackness in front of you, and a
roaring sound in your ears. there was something terrible on the other side
of the wall. you knew that you knew what it was, but you dared not drag it
into the open. it was the rats that were on the other side of the wall.'

'o'brien!' said winston, making an effort to control his voice. 'you know
this is not necessary. what is it that you want me to do?'

o'brien made no direct answer. when he spoke it was in the schoolmasterish
manner that he sometimes affected. he looked thoughtfully into the
distance, as though he were addressing an audience somewhere behind
winston's back.

'by itself,' he said, 'pain is not always enough. there are occasions when
a human being will stand out against pain, even to the point of death.
but for everyone there is something unendurable--something that cannot be
contemplated. courage and cowardice are not involved. if you

 are falling
from a height it is not cowardly to clutch at a rope. if you have come up
from deep water it is not cowardly to fill your lungs with air. it is
merely an instinct which cannot be destroyed. it is the same with the
rats. for you, they are unendurable. they are a form of pressure that you
cannot withstand, even if you wished to. you will do what is required of
you.'

'but what is it, what is it? how can i do it if i don't know what it is?'

o'brien picked up the cage and brought it across to the nearer table.
he set it down carefully on the baize cloth. winston could hear the blood
singing in his ears. he had the feeling of sitting in utter loneliness.
he was in the middle of a great empty plain, a flat desert drenched with
sunlight, across which all sounds came to him out of immense distances.
yet the cage with the rats was not two metres away from him. they were
enormous rats. they were at the age when a rat's muzzle grows blunt and

rce and his fur brown instead of grey.

'the rat,' said o'brien, still addressing his invisible audience,
'although a rodent, is carnivorous. you are aware of that. you will have
heard of the things that happen in the poor quarters of this town. in some
streets a woman dare not leave her baby alone in the house, even for five
minutes. the rats are certain to attack it. within quite a small time they
will strip it to the bones. they also attack sick or dying people. they
show astonishing intelligence in knowing when a human being is helpless.'

there was an

outburst of squeals from the cage. it seemed to reach winston
from far away. the rats were fighting; they were trying to get at each
other through the partition. he heard also a deep groan of despair.
that, too, seemed to come from outside himself.

o'brien picked up the cage, and, as he did so, pressed something in it.
there was a sharp click. winston made a frantic effort to tear himself
loose from the chair. it was hopeless; every part of him, even his head,
was held immovably. o'brien moved the cage nearer. it was less than a
metre from winston's face.

'i have pressed the first lever,' said o'brien. 'you understand the
construction of this cage. the mask will fit over your head, leaving no
exit. when i press this other lever, the door of the cage will slide up.
these starving brutes will shoot out of it like bullets. have you ever
seen a rat leap through the air? they will leap on to your face and bore
straight into it. sometimes they attack the eyes first. sometimes they

was large enough now to shut out the vision of
anything else. the wire door was a couple of hand-spans from his face. the
rats knew what was coming now. one of them was leaping up and down, the
other, an old scaly grandfather of the sewers, stood up, with his pink
hands against the bars, and fiercely sniffed the air. winston could see
the whiskers and the yellow teeth. again the black panic took hold of him.
he was blind, helpless, mindless.

'it was a common punishment in imperial china,' said o'brien as
didactically as ever.

the mask was closing on his face. the wire brushed his cheek. and then--no,
it was not relief, only hope, a tiny fragment of hope. too late, perhaps
too late. but he had suddenly understood that in the whole world there was
just one person to whom he could transfer his punishment--one body that he
could thrust between himself and the rats. and he was shouting frantically,
over and over.

'do it to julia! do it to julia! not me! julia! i don't care what you do
to her. t

ear her face off, strip her to the bones. not me! julia! not me!'

he was falling backwards, into enormous depths, away from the rats. he was
still strapped in the chair, but he had fallen through the floor, through
the walls of the building, through the earth, through the oceans, through
the atmosphere, into outer space, into the gulfs between the stars--always
away, away, away from the rats. he was light years distant, but o'brien
was still standing at his side. there was still the cold touch of wire
against his cheek. but through the darkness that enveloped him he heard
another metallic click, and knew that the cage door had clicked shut and
not open.




chapter 6



the chestnut tree was almost empty. a ray of sunlight slanting through a
window fell on dusty table-tops. it was the lonely hour of fifteen. a
tinny music trickled from the telescreens.

winston sat in his usual corner, gazing into an empty glass. now and

layers of feeling, in which one could not say which layer was
undermost--struggled inside him.

the spasm passed. he put the white knight back in its place, but for the
moment he could not settle down to serious study of the chess problem.
his thoughts wandered again. almost unconsciously he traced with his
finger in the dust on the table:

2+2=5

'they can't get inside you,' she had said. but they could get inside you.
'what happens to you here is for ever,' o'brien had said. that was a true
word. there were things, your own acts, from which you could never recover.
something was killed in your breast: burnt out, cauterized out.

he had seen her; he had even spoken to her. there was no danger in it. he
knew as though instinctively that they now took almost no interest in his
doings. he could have arranged to meet her a second time if either of them
had wanted to. actually it was by chance that they had met. it was in the
park, on a vile, biting day in marc
