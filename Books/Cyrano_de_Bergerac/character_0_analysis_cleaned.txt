cyrano is courageous, poetic, witty, and eloquent. he is a remarkable fighter, poet, musician, and philosopher, as well as a lover of beauty, ideals, and values. never presented in a bad or unflattering light, cyrano is difficult to dislike. throughout the play, cyrano acts according to his uncompromising sense of values and morals. he remains steadfast in his pursuit to become an honorable man and comes to represent the kind of man that everyone would like to be—and more.

cyrano displays bravado reminiscent of the warrior tradition, never talking himself or others out of a fight. cyrano’s brashness has earned him many enemies. his lack of self-confidence and low self-esteem, however, prove to be his most potent adversaries. more powerful than the simple flaw from which they grew—his nose—cyrano’s insecurities prevent him from attaining what he cherishes most: love. his inner beauty wins over everyone, but he, and only he, fails to forget about his large nose. in public, cyrano appears heroic, possessed of an extraordinary wit and a dizzying array of skills. his private self, however, is dark and despondent. rather than marring his image, the few flaws that cyrano possesses appear so fundamental to the human condition that they evoke an even deeper appreciation of his character.
cyrano never wavers in his commitment to roxane, but he may not be truly in love with her. perhaps he is in love with the idea of love and of being in love. after all, cyrano worships and obeys the magic, mystery, and poetry of love, as well as the powers and art of romance. delighted by the romantic challenge of dying for love, cyrano allows love to kill him in the end, even after roxane discovers and reciprocates his feelings.
