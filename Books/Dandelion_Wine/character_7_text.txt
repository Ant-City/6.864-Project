didn't stroll 
myself across a recollection of my grandparents' northern illinois grass, hoping to come 
across some old half-burnt firecracker, a rusted toy, or a fragment of letter written to 
myself in some young year hoping to contact the older person i became to remind him of 
his past, his life, his people, his joys, and his drenching sorrows. 

it became a game that i took to with immense gusto: to see how much i could 
remember about dandelions themselves, or picking wild grapes with my father and 
brother, rediscovering the mosquito-breeding ground rain barrel by the side bay window, 
or searching out the smell of the goldfuzzed bees that hung around our back porch grape 
arbor. bees do have a smell, you know, and if they don't they should, for their feet are 
dusted with spices from a million flowers. 

and then i wanted to call back what the ravine was like, especially on those nights 
when walking home late across town, after seeing lon chaney's delicious fright the 
phantom of t

"boy," whispered douglas. 

a whole summer ahead to cross off the calendar, day by day. like the goddess siva in 
the travel books, he saw his hands jump everywhere, pluck sour apples, peaches, and 
midnight plums. he would be clothed in trees and bushes and rivers. he would freeze, 
gladly, in the hoarfrosted icehouse door. he would bake, happily, with ten thousand 
chickens, in grandma's kitchen. 

but now— a familiar task awaited him. 

one night each week he was allowed to leave his father, his mother, and his younger 
brother tom asleep in their small house next door and run here, up the dark spiral stairs 
to his grandparents' cupola, and in this sorcerer's tower sleep with thunders and visions, 
to wake before the crystal jingle of milk bottles and perform his ritual magic. 

he stood at the open window in the dark, took a deep breath and exhaled. 

the street lights, like candles on a black cake, went out. he exhaled again and again 
and the stars began to vanish.

crossing the lawn that morning, douglas spaulding broke a spider web with his face. a 
single invisible line on the air touched his brow and snapped without a sound. 

so, with the subtlest of incidents, he knew that this day was going to be different. it 
would be different also, because, as his father explained, driving douglas and his ten- 
year-old brother tom out of town toward the country, there were some days 
compounded completely of odor, nothing but the world blowing in one nostril and out the 
other. and some days, he went on, were days of hearing every trump and trill of the 
universe. some days were good for tasting and some for touching. and some days were 
good for all the senses at once. this day now, he nodded, smelled as if a great and 
nameless orchard had grown up overnight

"all right, boys, behave." 

they had been jostling elbows. 

"yes, sir." 

they climbed out, carrying the blue tin pails away from the lonely dirt road into the 
smell of fallen rain. 

"look for bees," said father. "bees hang around grapes like boys around kitchens, 
doug?" douglas looked up suddenly. 

"you're off a million miles," said father. "look alive. walk with us." 
"yes, sir." 

and they walked through the forest, father very tall, douglas moving in his shadow, 
and tom, very small, trotting in his brother's shade. they came to a little rise and looked 
ahead. here, here, did they see? father pointed. here was where the big summer-quiet 
winds lived and passed in the green depths, like ghost wha

he liked to listen to the silence, he said, if silence could be listened to, for, he went on, in 
that silence you could hear wildflower pollen sifting down the bee-fried air, by god, the 
bee-fried air! listen! the waterfall of birdsong beyond those trees! 

now, thought douglas, here it comes! running! i don't see it! running! almost on me! 

"fox grapes!" said father. "we're in luck, look here!"

but tom and dad bent down to shove their hands deep in rattling bush. the spell was 
shattered. the terrible prowler, the magnificent runner, the leaper, the shaker of souls, 
vanished. 

douglas, lost and empty, fell to his knees. he saw his fingers sink through green 
shadow and come forth stained with such color that it seemed he had somehow cut the 
forest and delved his hand in the open wound.

which were, no more, no less, said father, the world humming under its breath, they sat 
on a green-mossed log, chewing sandwiches and trying to listen to the forest the same 
way father did. douglas felt dad watching him, quietly amused. dad started to say 
something that had crossed his mind, but instead tried another bite of sandwich and 
mused over it. 

"sandwich outdoors isn't a sandwich anymore. tastes different than indoors, notice? 
got more spice. tastes like mint and pinesap. does wonders for the appetite." 

douglas's tongue hesitated on the texture of bread and deviled ham. no . . .no . . .it

the bees followed and the smell of fox grapes and yellow summer followed as he 
walked heavy-laden and half drunk, his fingers wonderously callused, arms numb, feet 
stumbling so his father caught his shoulder. 

"no," mumbled douglas, "i'm all right. i'm fine . . ." 

it took half an hour for the sense of the grass, the roots, the stones, the bark of the 
messy log, to fade from where they had patterned his arms and legs and back. while he 
pondered this, let it slip, slide, dissolve away, his brother and his quiet father followed 
behind, allowing him to pathfind the forest alone out toward that incredible highway 
which would take them back to the town . . .

grandfather stood on the wide front porch like a captain surveying the vast 
unmotioned calms of a season dead ahead. he questioned the wind and the untouchable 
sky and the lawn on which stood douglas and tom to question only him. 

"grandpa, are they ready? now?" 

grandfather pinched his chin. "five hundred, a thousand, two thousand easy. yes, 
yes, a good supply. pick 'em easy, pick 'em all. a dime for every sack delivered to the 
press!" 

"hey!"

world, dripped off lawns onto brick streets, tapped softly at crystal cellar windows and 
agitated themselves so that on all sides lay the dazzle and glitter of molten sun.

sees, yes. but for us, a noble thing, the dandelion." 

so, plucked carefully, in sacks, the dandelions were carried below. the cellar dark 
glowed with their arrival. the wine press stood open, cold. a rush of flowers warmed it. 
the press, replaced, its screw rotated, twirled by grandfather, squeezed gently on the 
crop. 

"there . . . so . . ." 

the golden tide, the essence of this fine fair month ran, then gushed from the spout 
below, to be crocked, skimmed of ferment, and bottled in clean ketchup shakers, then 
ranked in sparkling rows in cellar gloom.

the words were summer on the tongue. the wine was summer caught and stoppered.

yes, even grandma, drawn to the cellar of winter for a june adventure, might stand

father and uncle pert, or some of the boarders, communing with a last touch of a 
calendar long departed, with the picnics and the warm rains and the smell of fields of 
wheat and new popcorn and bending hay. even grandma, repeating and repeating the 
fine and golden words, even as they were said now in this moment when the flowers 
were dropped into the press, as they would be repeated every winter for all the white 
winters in time. saying them over and over on the lips, like a smile, li

the first rite of summer, the dandelion picking, the starting of the wine, was over. 
now the second rite waited for him to make the motions, but he stood very still. 

"doug . . .come on . . .doug . . . !"the running boys faded. 

"i'm alive," said douglas. "but what's the use? they're more alive than me. how 
come? how come?" and standing alone, he knew the answer, staring down at his 
motionless feet . . . 



late that night, going home from the show with his mother and father and his brother 
tom, douglas saw the tennis shoes in the bright store window. he glanced quickly away, 
but his ankles were seized, his feet suspended, then rushed. the earth spun; the shop 
awnings slammed their canvas wings overhead with the thrust of his body running. his 
mother and father and brother walked quietly on both sides of him. douglas walked 
backward, watching the tennis shoes in the midnight window left behind. 

"it was a nice movie," said mother. 

douglas murmured, "it was

leave not a stir in the clover and weeds. and here douglas stood, trapped on the dead 
cement and the red-brick streets, hardly able to move. 

"dad!" he blurted it out. "back there in that window, those cream-sponge para

his father didn't even turn. "suppose you tell me why you need a new pair of

it was because they felt the way it feels every summer when you take off your shoes 
for the first time and run in the grass. they felt like it feels sticking your feet out of the

they put marshmallows and coiled springs in the soles and they wove the rest out of 
grasses bleached and fired in the wilderness. somewhere deep in the soft loam of the 
shoes the thin hard sinews of the buck deer were hidden. the people that made the 
shoes must have watched a lot of winds blow the trees and a lot of rivers going down to 
the lakes. whatever it was, it was in the shoes, and it was summer. 

douglas tried to get all this in words. 

"yes," said father, "but what's wrong with last year's sneakers? why can't you dig 
them out of the closet?" 

well, he felt sorry for boys who lived in california where they wore tennis shoes all 
year and never knew what it was to get winter off your feet, peel off the iron leather 
shoes all full of snow and rain and run barefoot for a day and then lace on the first new 
tennis shoes of the season, which was better than barefoot. the magic was always in the

yes, summer was rituals, each with its natural time and place. the ritual of lemonade 
or ice-tea making, the ritual of wine, shoes, or no shoes, and at last, swiftly following the 
others, with quiet dignity, the ritual of the front-porch swing. 

on the third day of summer in the late afternoon grandfather reappeared from the 
front door to gaze serenely at the two empty eye rings in the ceiling of the porch. moving 
to the geranium-pot-lined rail like ahab surveying the mild mild day and mild-looking 
sky, he wet his finger to test the wind, and shucked his coat to see how shirt sleeves felt 
in the westering hours. he acknowledged the salutes of other captains on yet other 
flowered porches, out themselves to discern the gentle ground swell of weather, oblivious 
to their wives chirping or snap

in the garage they found, dusted, and carried forth the howdah, as it were, for the

eyelets. 

douglas, being lighter, was first to sit in the swing. then, after a moment, grandfather 
gingerly settled his pontifical weight beside the boy. thus they sat, smiling at each other, 
nodding, as they swung silently back and forth, back and forth. 

ten minutes later grandma appeared with water buckets and brooms to wash down 
and sweep off the porch. other chairs, rockers and straight-backs, were summoned from 
the house.

widening his large liquid-dark eyes, at last threw up his childlike hands and cried out in

cool soft fount; grandfather imagined it tickling his legs, spraying his warm face, filling 
his nostrils with the timeless scent of a new season begun, with the promise that, yes, 
we'll all live another twelve months. 

god bless the lawn mower, he thought. who was the fool who made january first new

right," he said. "bought the grass yesterday. thought, while i'm on vacation i'd just plant 
it for you." 

"why wasn't i consulted about this? it's my lawn!" cried grandfather. 
"thought you'd appreciate it, mr. spaulding." 

"well, i don't think i do appreciate it. let's see this confounded grass of yours." 

they stood by the little square pads of new grass. grandpa toed at it with one end of 
his shoe suspiciously. "looks like plain old grass to me. you sure some horse trader 
didn't catch you early in the morning when you weren't fully awake?"

i'd miss it fearfully if it wasn't there, and i'd miss the smell of cut grass." 

bill bent to pick up a flat. "here i go to the ravine."

the morning passed, noon came on, grandpa retired after lunch, read a little whittier, 
and slept well on through the day. when he awoke at three the sun was streaming 
through the windows, bright and fresh. he lay in bed and was startled to hear the old, 
the familiar, the memorable sound.

he felt the hairs rise along the back of his neck. 

when saul slept again, uneasily, whimpering, his father went downstairs and out to 
the garage where, not breathing, he put his hand out. 

in the cool night the happiness machine's metal was too hot to touch. 

so, he thought, saul was here tonight. 

why? was saul unhappy, in need of the machine? no, happy, but wanting to hold onto 
happiness always. could you blame a boy wise enough to know his position who tried to 
keep it that way? no! and yet . . .

and then inside the happiness machine, lena auffmann began to weep. 

the inventor's smile faded. 

"she's crying" said naomi.

"she simply can't be crying!" leo auffmann, blinking, pressed his ear to the machine.

"all right, saul," she said. "run call the fire department." 



everybody who was anybody came to the fire. there was grandpa spaulding and 
douglas and tom and most of the boarders and some of the old men from across the 
ravine and all the children from six blocks around. and leo auffmann's children stood out 
front, proud of how fine the flames looked jumping from the garage roof. 

grandfather spaulding studied the smoke ball in the sky and said, quietly, "lee, was 
that it? your happiness machine?" 

"some year," said leo auffmann "i'll figure it and tell you." 

lena auffmann, standing in the dark now, watched as the firemen ran in and out of 
the yard; the garage, roaring, settled upon itself. 

"leo," she said, "it won't take a year to figure. look around. think. keep quiet a little

when the firemen and the neighbors were gone leo auffmann was left with 
grandfather spaulding and douglas and tom, brooding over the smoldering ruin. he 
stirred his foot in the wet ashes and slowly said what he had to say. 

"the first thing you learn in life is you're a fool. the last thing you learn in life is you're 
the same fool. in one hour, i've done a lot of thinking. i thought, leo auffmann is

"but the fire—" said douglas. 

"sure, the fire, the garage! but like lena said, it don't take a year to figure; what 
burned in the garage don't count!" they followed him up the front-porch steps. 

"here," whispered leo auffmann, "the front window. quiet, and you'll see it." 

hesitantly, grandfather, douglas, and tom peered through the large windowpane. 

and there, in small warm pools of lamplight, you could see what leo auffmann wanted 
you to see. there sat saul and marshall, playing chess at the coffee table. in the dining 
room rebecca was laying out the silver. naomi was cutting paper-doll dresses. ruth was 
painting water colors. joseph was running his electric train. through the kitchen door, 
lena auffmann was sliding a pot roast from the steaming oven. every hand, every head,

grandfather, douglas, and tom turned to look at leo auffmann, who gazed serenely 
through the window, the pink light on his cheeks. 

"sure," he murmured. "there it is." and he watched with now-gentle sorrow and now- 
quick delight, and at last quiet acceptance as all the bits and pieces of this house mixed,

douglas raised the bottle of warm dandelion wine but did not set it on the shelf. he

upstairs, on his bed, douglas breathed. 

it was a sound like a sharp knife going in and out, in and out, of a sheath. 



at eight o'clock the doctor came and went again shaking his head, his coat off, his tie 
untied, looking as if he had lost thirty pounds that day. at nine o'clock tom and mother 
and father carried a cot outside and brought douglas down to sleep in the yard under 
the apple tree where, if there might be a wind, it would find him sooner than in the 
terrible rooms above. then they went back and forth until eleven o'clock, when they set 
the alarm clock to wake them at three and chip more ice to refill the packs. 

the house was dark and still at last, and they slept. 

at twelve thirty-five, douglas's eyes flinched.

"what's grandma cooking for dinner tonight?" said aunt rose's voice from the real 
world of afternoon in the parlor. 

"no one knows what grandma cooks," said grandfather, home from the office early to 
tend this immense flower, "until we sit at table. there's always mystery, always 
suspense." 

"well, i always like to know what i'm going to eat," cried aunt rose, and laughed. the 
chandelier prisms in the dining room rang with pain. 

douglas moved deeper into pantry darkness.

but to his horror he heard them sweeping and dusting, throwing out half-empty sacks, 
pasting new labels on cans, putting dishes and pots and pans in drawers that had stood 
empty for years. even the knives, which had lain like a catch of silvery fish on the kitchen 
tables, were dumped into boxes. 

grandfather had been listening behind douglas for a full five minutes. somewhat 
uneasily he scratched his chin. "now that i think of it, that kitchen's been a mess right on 
down the line. things need a little arrangement, no doubt. and if what aunt rose claims 
is true, doug boy, it'll be a rare experience at supper tomorrow night."

looked as if she had been chased around town. she gasped as rose helped her into the 
house. 

"there you are, grandma. now you got everything where you can find it. now you can

served, or i'll eat my vest."

smiling people stopped smiling. douglas chewed one bit of food for three minutes, and

the boarders murmured, all of them, locked in the dim, comfortable library.

heavily on douglas's shoulder. "douglas, we have a great mission for you, son. now

the boarders, all ten of them, were seated on the porch stiffly. grandfather, like a 
train conductor, a mayor, a good friend, came down the steps solemnly. 

"rose," he said to her, taking her hand and shaking it up and down, "i have 
something to say to you" 

"what is it?" said aunt rose.

grandfather took out his solid gold watch. "and now i suggest we all repair to the library 
for a glass of sherry while waiting for grandma to fix one of her amazing banquets." 

grandma walked off to the back of the house. 

everyone talked and laughed and listened— the boarders, grandfather, and douglas, 
and they heard the quiet sounds in the kitchen. when grandma rang the bell they herded

grandfather, arriving home from a late evening's work at the printing office, was

as for the food? the meats were deviled, the sauces curried, the greens mounded with 
sweet butter, the biscuits splashed with jeweled honey; everything toothsome, luscious,

"grandma," he said, "i ask only that tomorrow night for supper you cook us this very

douglas laughed. they went down in the cellar with grandpa and while he decapitated

motionless streams, the bottles of dandelion wine. numbered from one to ninety-odd, 
there the ketchup bottles, most of them full now, stood burning in the cellar twilight, one 
for every living summer day. 

"boy," said tom, "what a swell way to save june, july, and august. real practical." 
grandfather looked up, considered this, and smiled. 

"better than putting things in the attic you never use again. this way, you get to live 
the summer over for a minute or two here or there along the way through the winter, 
and when the bottles are empty the summer's gone for good and no regrets and no 
sentimental trash lying about for you to stumble over forty years from now. clean,
