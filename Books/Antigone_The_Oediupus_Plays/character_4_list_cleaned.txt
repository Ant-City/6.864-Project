[CHARACTER] - 
                	son
of oedipus, and thus also his brother. [CHARACTER] appears only very
briefly in oedipus at colonus. he arrives at colonus
seeking his father's blessing in his battle with his brother, eteocles,
for power in thebes. [CHARACTER] tries to point out the similarity
between his own situation and that of oedipus, but his words seem opportunistic
rather than filial, a fact that oedipus points out.
