[CHARACTER]  - 
      [CHARACTER]--wilde's saint john the baptist--is the prophet imprisoned in a tomb-like cistern at the orders of the tetrarch. "terrible to look at", he spends much of the play in his subterranean prison, figuring as a mad, booming voice that prophecies the ruin of the kingdom, curses the royal family, and proclaims the coming of christ. he appears on-stage and takes corporeal form, against his wishes, at salome's lustful call. as a mystic, [CHARACTER] is a tabooed body: herod bans others from seeing him, and he himself--as salome learns--refuses to suffer the gaze of the cursed. he is also "blind" in a sense, failing to see those around him in his inspiration by the divine word.
