scene ii. rome. a room in the house of lepidus.

[enter enobarbus and lepidus.]

lepidus.
good enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,
and shall become you well, to entreat your captain
to soft and gentle speech.

enobarbus.
i shall entreat him
to answer like himself: if caesar move him,
let antony look over caesar's head,
and speak as loud as mars. by jupiter,
were i the wearer of antonius' beard,
i would not shave't to-day.

lepidus.
'tis not a time
for private stomaching.

enobarbus.
every time

lepidus.
but small to greater matters must give way.

enobarbus.
not if the small come first.

lepidus.

enobarbus.
a very fine one: o, how he loves caesar!

agrippa.
nay, but how dearly he adores mark antony!

enobarbus.
caesar? why he's the jupiter of men.

agrippa.
what's antony? the god of jupiter.

enobarbus.
spake you of caesar? how! the nonpareil!

agrippa.
o, antony! o thou arabian bird!

enobarbus.
would you praise caesar, say 'caesar'--go no further.

agrippa.
indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.

enobarbus.
but he loves caesar best;--yet he loves antony:
hoo! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, poets, cannot
think, speak, cast, write, sing, number--hoo!--
his love to antony. but as for cae
