Bushy, Bagot, and Green (also called Greene) - 
      
        Richard's friends and loyal backers in the court. Bushy and Greene are trapped by Bolingbroke and executed in Act II, scene ii; Bagot, also captured, turns informer in Act IV, scene i and apparently survives the play. (These three names are sometimes mentioned alongside that of the mysterious Earl of Wiltshire, a character whom Shakespeare apparently meant to be another of Richard's friends but failed to write into any actual scenes.)
