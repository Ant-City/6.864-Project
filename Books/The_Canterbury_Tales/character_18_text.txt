notes to the prologue to the merchant's tale


1.  though the manner in which the merchant takes up the
closing words of the envoy to the clerk's tale, and refers to
the patience of griselda, seems to prove beyond doubt that
the order of the tales in the text is the right one, yet in
some manuscripts of good authority the franklin's tale
follows the clerk's, and the envoy is concluded by this
stanza: --
"this worthy clerk when ended was his tale,
our hoste said, and swore by cocke's bones
'me lever were than a barrel of ale
my wife at home had heard this legend once;
this is a gentle tale for the nonce;
as, to my purpose, wiste ye my will.
but thing that will not be, let it be still.'"

in other manuscripts of less authority the host proceeds, in
two similar stanzas, to impose a tale on the franklin; but

family; and
in thorough consistency with this plan, and with the canons of
chivalric story, would be "the marriage of canace to some
knight who was first obliged to fight for her with her two
brethren; a method of courtship," adds tyrwhitt, "very
consonant to the spirit of ancient chivalry."

lines, being the beginning of the third part, are found: -

notes to the prologue to the franklin's tale


1. in the older editions, the verses here given as the prologue
were prefixed to the merchant's tale, and put into his mouth.
tyrwhitt was abundantly justified, by the internal evidence
afforded by the lines themselves, in transferring them to their
present place.

2. the "breton lays" were an important and curious element in
the literature of the middle ages; they were originally
composed in the armorican language, and the chief collection
of them extant was translated into french ver

calling herself "marie," about the middle of the thirteenth
century.  but though this collection was the most famous, and
had doubtless been read by chaucer, there were other british or
breton lays, and from one of those the franklin's tale is taken.
boccaccio has dealt with the same story in the "decameron"
and the "philocopo,"  altering the circumstances to suit the
removal of its scene to a southern clime.

notes to the prologue to the doctor's tale


1. the authenticity of the prologue is questionable. it is found in
one manuscript only; other manuscripts give other prologues,
more plainly not chaucer's than this; and some manuscripts
have merely a colophon to the effect that "here endeth the
franklin's tale and beginneth the physician's tale without a
prologue." the tale itself is the well-known story of virginia,
with several departures from the text of livy. chaucer probably
followed the "romance of the rose" and gower's "confessio
amantis," in both of which the story is found.

notes to the nun's priest's tale


1.  the tale of the nun's priest is founded on the fifth chapter
of an old french metrical "romance of renard;" the same story
forming one of the fables of marie, the translator of the breton
lays. (see note 2 to the prologue to the franklin's tale.)
although dryden was in error when he ascribed the tale to
chaucer's own invention, still the materials on which he had to
operate were out of cornparison more trivial than the result.

2.  tyrwhitt quotes two statutes of edward iii, in which "deys"
are included among the servants employed in agricultural
pursuits; the name seems to have originally meant a servant who
gave his labour by the day, but afterwards to have been
appropriated exclusively to one who superintended or worked

un's priest
seem, as tyrwhitt observes, to commence the prologue to the
succeeding tale -- but the difficulty is to determine which that
tale should be. in earlier editions, the lines formed the opening
of the prologue to the manciple's tale; but most of the
manuscripts acknowledge themselves defective in this part, and
give the nun's tale after that of the nun's priest. in the harleian
manuscript, followed by mr wright, the second nun's tale, and
the canon's yeoman's tale, are placed after the franklin's tale;
and the sixteen lines above are not found -- the manciple's
prologue coming immediately after the "amen" of the nun's
priest. in two manuscripts, the last line of the sixteen runs thus:
"said unto the nun as ye shall hear;" and six lines more
evidently forged, are given to introduce the nun's tale.  all this
confusion and doubt only strengthen the certainty, and deepen
the regret, that "the canterbury tales" were left at chaucer's,
death not merely very imperfect as a whole, but destitu

 "shave" -- meaning a trick or fraud.

tales.

16. if this reference is to any book of chaucer's in which the
house of fame was mentioned, the book has not come down to
us. it has been reasonably supposed, however, that chaucer
means by "his own book" ovid's "metamorphoses," of which he
was evidently very fond; and in the twelfth book of that poem
the temple of fame is described.

17. saint julian was the patron of hospitality; so the franklin, in
the prologue to the canterbury tales is said to be "saint julian
in his country," for his open house and liberal cheer. the eagle,
at sight of the house of fame, cries out "bon hostel!" -- "a fair
lodging, a glorious house, by st julian!"

assembly of fowls.

prominent part in the tenth book of statius' "thebaid." both he

word, see note 14 to the franklin's tale.

39. pythonesses:  women who, like the pythia in apollo's
temple at delphi, were possessed with a spirit of divination or
prophecy. the barbarous latin form of the word was
"pythonissa" or "phitonissa." see note 9 to the friar's tale.

14. mr bell thinks that chaucer here praises the complaisance
of marcia, the wife of cato, in complying with his will when he
made her over to his friend hortensius. it would be in better
keeping with the spirit of the poet's praise, to believe that we
should read "porcia catoun" -- porcia the daughter of cato,
who was married to brutus, and whose perfect wifehood has
been celebrated in the franklin's tale. see note 25 to the
franklin's tale.
