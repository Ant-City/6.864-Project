pick somebody. you  had to think of someÂ­

one  everybody  knew.  someone  you  could  imitate  and 
everyone  else  would  have  to  guess  who  it  was.  it started 
out  with  famous  people:  wonder  woman,  the  beatles, 

the house on mango street  59 

born bad. 

most likely  i  will  go to hell and most likely  i deserve 
to be there.  my  mother says i was born on an evil day and 
prays for me. lucy and rachel pray too. for ourselves and 
for each other ... because of what we  did to aunt lupe. 
her name was guadalupe and she was pretty like my 
mother. dark. good to look at. in her joan crawford dress 
and swimmer's legs.  aunt lupe of the photographs. 

but i  knew  her sick  from the disease that would  not 
go,  her legs bunched  under the  yellow  sheets,  the  bones 
gone limp as  worms.  the yellow  pillow,  the yellow  smell, 
the bottles and spoons. her head thrown back like a thirsty 
lady.  my  aunt, the swimmer.
