  orlando. as i remember, adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed
    me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou say'st,
    charged my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there
    begins my sadness. my brother jaques he keeps at school, and
    report speaks goldenly of his profit. for my part, he keeps me
    rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at
    home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my
    birth that diffe

they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly
    hir'd; but i, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for
    the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him
    as i. besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the
    something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from
    me. he lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
    brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my
    education. this is it, adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of
    my father, which i think is within me, begins to mutiny against
    this servitude. i will no longer endure it, though yet i know no
    wise remedy how to avoid it.

                           enter oliver


  adam. yonder comes my master, your brother.

  orlando. go apart, adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me
    up.                                           [adam retires]

  orlando. come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.

  oliver. wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?

  orlando. i am no villain; i am the youngest son of sir rowland de
    boys. he was my father; and he is thrice a villain that says such
    a father begot villains. wert thou not my brother, i would not
    take this hand from thy throat till this other had pull'd out thy
    tongue for saying so. thou has rail'd on thyself.

  adam. [coming forward] sweet masters, be patient; for your father's
    remembrance, be at accord.

  oliver. let me go, i say.

  orlando. i will not, till i please; you shall hear me. my father
    charg'd you in his will to give me good education: you have
    train'd me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all
    gentleman-like qualities. the spirit of my father grows strong in
    me, and i will no longer endure it; therefore allow me such
    exercises as may become a gentle

    allottery my father left me by testament; with that i will go buy
    my fortunes.

  oliver. and what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent? well, sir,
    get you in. i will not long be troubled with you; you shall have
    some part of your will. i pray you leave me.

  orlando. i no further offend you than becomes me for my good.

  oliver. get you with him, you old dog.

  adam. is 'old dog' my reward? most true, i have lost my teeth in
    your service. god be with my old master! he would not have spoke
    such a word.

  duke senior. now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,
    hath not old custom made this life more sweet
    than that of painted pomp? are not these woods
    more free from peril than the envious court?
    here feel we not the penalty of adam,
    the seasons' difference; as the icy fang
    and churlish chiding of the winter's wind,
    which when it bites and blows upon my body,
    even till i shrink with cold, i smile and say
    'this is no flattery; these are counsellors
    that feelingly persuade me what i am.'
    sweet are the uses of adversity,
    which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
    wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
    and this our life, exempt from public haunt,

    o my sweet master! o you memory
    of old sir rowland! why, what make you here?
    why are you virtuous? why do people love you?
    and wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant?
    why would you be so fond to overcome
    the bonny prizer of the humorous duke?
    your praise is come too swiftly home before you.

  adam. o unhappy youth!

    the enemy of all your graces lives.

  adam. no matter whither, so you come not here.

  orlando. what, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food,
    or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce
    a thievish living on the common road?
    this i must do, or know not what to do;
    yet this i will not do, do how i can.
    i rather will subject me to the malice
    of a diverted blood and bloody brother.

    thou art not for the fashion of these times,
    where none will sweat but for promotion,
    and having that do choke their service up
    even with the having; it is not so with thee.
    but, poor old man, thou prun'st a rotten tree
    that cannot so much as a blossom yield
    in lieu of all thy pains and husbandry.
    but come thy ways, we'll go along together,
    and ere we have thy youthful wages spent
    we'll light upon some settled low content.
