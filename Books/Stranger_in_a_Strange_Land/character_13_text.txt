duke and i going to have to put up
with our own cooking until i can dig up more help?"
 "we've talked that over," mike answered. "jill is going with me- nobody else. i do need
somebody with me, jubal; i know quite well that i don't know, as yet, how people do things out in the
world. i still make mistakes; i need a guide, for a time. i think it ought to be jill, because she wants to go
on learning martian-and the others think so, too. but if you want jill to stay, then it could be someone
else. duke and larry are each willing to help me, if you can't spare one of the girls."
 "you mean i get a vote?"

 "what? jubal, it has to be your decision. we all know that."
 (son, you're a gent-and you've probably just told your first lie- i doubt if i could hold even duke

 "we know that-and we'll be back. a

disappointed. now about duke and larry: i don't know nor care. whenever anyone has come here, to
work and live as a member of the family, i have made it bluntly plain that this was neither a sweat shop
nor a whore house, but a home . . . and, as such, it combined anarchy and tyranny without a trace of
democracy, as in any well-run family, i.e., that they were utterly on their own except where i saw fit to
give orders, which orders were not subject to vote or debate. my tyranny has never extended to their
love life, if any. all the k

ids who live here have always chosen to keep their private matters reasonably
private. at least-" jubal smiled ruefully. "-until the martian influence caused things to get a little out of

one sense or the other. perhaps they have been dragging the gals behind every bush. if so, i haven't seen
it-and there have been no screams."
 ben thought of adding a little to jubal's store of facts, decided against it. "then you think it's
mike."
 jubal scowled. "yep, i think it's mike. that part's all right-i told you the girls were smugly happy
. . . and i'm not broke plus the fact that i could bleed mike for any amount without telling the girls. their
