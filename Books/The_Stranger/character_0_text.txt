ed to see mother at once, but the doorkeeper told me i must see the warden
first. he wasn’t free, and i had to wait a bit. the doorkeeper chatted with me while i
waited; then he led me to the office. the warden was a very small man, with gray
hair, and a legion of honor rosette in his buttonhole. he gave me a long look with
his watery blue eyes. then we shook hands, and he held mine so long that i began to
feel embarrassed. after that he consulted a register on his table, and said:

“madame meursault entered the home three years ago. she had no private means

and depended entirely on you.”

albert camus (cid:153) the stranger

i had a feeling he was blaming me for something, and started to explain. but he

cut me short.

“there’s  no  need  to  excuse  yourself,  my  boy.  i’ve  looked  up  the  record  and
obviously  you  weren’t  in  a  position  to  see  that  she  was  properly  cared  for.  she
needed someone to be with her all the time, and young men in jobs like yours

 a nervous state for
two or three days. which means, of course, extra work and worry for our staff.”

we crossed a courtyard where there were a number of old men, talking amongst
themselves in little groups. they fell silent as we came up with them. then, behind
our backs, the chattering began again. their voices reminded me of parakeets in a
cage, only the sound wasn’t quite so shrill. the warden stopped outside the entrance
of a small, low building.

“so  here  i  leave  you,  monsieur  meursault.  if  you  want  me  for  anything,  you’ll
find me in my office. we propose to have the funeral tomorrow morning. that will
enable you to spend the night beside your mother’s coffin, as no doubt you would
wish  to  do.  just  one  more  thing;  i  gathered  from  your  mother’s  friends  that  she
wished to be buried with the rites of the church. i’ve made arrangements for this; but
i thought i should let you know.”

i thanked him. so far as i knew, my mother, though not a professed

d the way into the
mortuary.

i noticed at once that four men in black were standing behind the coffin and the
screws in the lid had now been driven home. at the same moment i heard the warden
remark  that  the  hearse  had  arrived,  and  the  priest  starting  his  prayers.  then
everybody made a move. holding a strip of black cloth, the four men approached the
coffin, while the priest, the boys, and myself filed out. a lady i hadn’t seen before
was standing by the door. “this is monsieur meursault,” the warden said to her. i
didn’t catch her name, but i gathered she was a nursing sister attached to the home.
when i was introduced, she bowed, without the trace of a smile on her long, gaunt
face.  we  stood  aside  from  the  doorway  to  let  the  coffin  by;  then,  following  the
bearers down a corridor, we came to the front entrance, where a hearse was waiting.
oblong, glossy, varnished black all over, it vaguely reminded me of the pen trays in
the office.

all. i followed him upstairs, and we
parted  on  the  landing.  a  minute  or  two  later  i  heard  salamano’s  footsteps  and  a
knock on my door.

when i opened it, he halted for a moment in the doorway.
“excuse me ... i hope i’m not disturbing you.”
i  asked  him  in,  but  he  shook  his  head.  he  was  staring  at  his  toe  caps,  and  the

gnarled old hands were trembling. without meeting my eyes, he started talking.

“they won’t really take him from me, will they, monsieur meursault? surely they

wouldn’t do a thing like that. if they do—i don’t know what will become of me.”

i told him that, so far as i knew, they kept stray dogs in the pound for three days,
waiting for their owners to call for them. after that they disposed of the dogs as they
thought fit.

he stared at me in silence for a moment, then said, “good evening.” after that i
heard  him  pacing  up  and  down  his  room for  quite  a  while.  then  his  bed  creaked.

saying,  “that’s
him.”  we  walked  steadily  on.  masson  wondered  how  they’d  managed  to  track  us
here. my impression was that they had seen us taking the bus and noticed marie’s
oilcloth bathing bag; but i didn’t say anything.

though the arabs walked quite slowly, they were much nearer already. we didn’t

change our pace, but raymond said:

“listen! if there’s a roughhouse, you, masson, take on the second one. i’ll tackle
the  fellow  who’s  after  me.  and  you,  meursault,  stand  by  to  help  if  another  one
comes up, and lay him out.”

i said, “right,” and masson put his hands in his pockets.
the  sand  was  as  hot  as  fire,  and  i  could  have  sworn  it  was  glowing  red.  the
distance between us and the arabs was steadily decreasing. when we were only a
few steps away the arabs halted. masson and i slowed down, while raymond went
straight up to his man. i couldn’t hear what he said, but i saw the native lowering his
head,  as  if  to  butt  hi
