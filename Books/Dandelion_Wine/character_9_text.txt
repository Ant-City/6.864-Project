the great house stirred below. 

"grandpa, get your teeth from the water glass!" he waited a decent interval. 
"grandma and great-grandma, fry hot cakes!" 

the warm scent of fried batter rose in the drafty halls to stir the boarders, the aunts, 
the uncles, the visiting cousins, in their rooms. 

"street where all the old people live, wake up! miss helen loomis, colonel freeleigh, 
miss bentley! cough, get up, take pills, move around! mr. jonas, hitch up your horse, get

at all the dogs. "mr. tridden, run to the carbarn!" soon, scattering hot blue sparks above

the people across the street; miss fern and miss roberta humming by in their electric

and fan away the fever in their cheeks; or mr. jonas, the junkman, having left his horse 
and wagon hidden in the alley, and ripe t, bursting with words, would come up the steps 
looking as fresh as if his talk had never been said before, and somehow it never had. and 
last of all, the children, who had been off squinting their way through a last hide-and-

the soundless lawn, to sink beneath the talking talking talking of the porch voices which

this time the cicadas sang even faster. 



from noontime to sundown, from midnight to sunrise, one man, one horse, and one 
wagon were known to all twenty-six thousand three hundred forty-nine inhabitants of 
green town, illinois. 

in the middle of the day, for no reason quickly apparent, children would stop still and 
say:

"here comes mr. jonas!" 
"here comes ned!" 
"here comes the wagon!" 

older folks might peer north or south, east or west and see no sign of the man named 
jonas, the horse named ned, or the wagon which was a conestoga of the kind that 
bucked the prairie tides to beach on the wilderness. 

but then if you borrowed the ear of a dog and tuned it high and stretched it taut you 
could hear, miles and miles across the town a singing like a rabbi in the lost lands, a

ent clear before him so people had a half 
an hour, an hour, to prepare for his arrival. and by the time his wagon appeared, the 
curbs were lined by children, as for a parade. 

so here came the wagon and on its high board seat under a persimmon-colored 
umbrella, the reins like a stream of water in his gentle hands, was mr. jonas, singing. 



"junk! junk! no, sir, not junk! junk! junk! no, ma'am, not junk! bricabracs, brickbats! 
knitting needles, knick-knacks! kickshaws! curies! camisoles! cameos! but . . . junk! 
junk! no, sir, not . . . junk!" 



as anyone could tell who had heard the songs mr. jonas made up as he passed, he 
was no ordinary junkman. to all appearances, yes, the way he dressed in tatters of 
moss-corduroy and the felt cap on his head, covered with old presidential campaign 
buttons going back befor

y. but he was unusual in this way: not only did he 
tread the sunlight, but often you could see him and his horse swimming along the 
moonlit streets, circling and recircling by night the islands, the blocks where all the 
people lived he had known all of his life. and in that wagon he carried things he had 
picked up here and there and carried for a day or a week or a year until someone wanted 
and needed them. then all they had to say was, "i want that clock," or "how about the 
mattress?" and jonas would hand it over, take no money, and drive away, considering 
the words for another tune. 

so it happened that often he was the only man alive in all green town at three in the 
morning and often people with headaches, seeing him amble by with his moon- 
shimmered horse, would run out to see if by chance he had aspirin, which he did. more 
than once he had delivered babies at four in the morning and only then had people 
noticed how incredibly clean his hands and fingernails were— the hand

 spend the rest of his life seeing to it that one part of town had a chance to 
pick over what the other part of town had cast off. he looked upon himself as a kind of 
process, like osmosis, that made various cultures within the city limits available one to 
another. he could not stand waste, for he knew that one man's junk is another man's 
luxury. 

so adults, and especially children, clambered up to peer over into the vast treasure 
horde in the back of the wagon. 

"now, remember," said mr. jonas, "you can have what you want if you really want it. 
the test is, ask yourself, do i want it with all my heart? could i live through the day 
without it? if you figure to be dead by sundown, grab the darned thing and run. i'll be 
happy to let you have whatever it is." 

and the children searched the vast heaps of parchments and brocades and bolts of 
wallpaper and marble ash trays and vests and roller skates and great fat overstuffed 
chairs and end tables and crystal chandeliers. for a while

you just heard whispering and 
rattling and tinkling. mr. jonas watched, comfortably puffing on his pipe, and the children 
knew he watched. sometimes their hands reached out for a game of checkers or a string 
of beads or an old chair, and just as they touched it they looked up and there were mr. 
jonas's eyes gently questioning them. and they pulled their hand away and looked 
further on. until at last each of them put their hand on a single item and left it there. 
their faces came up and this time their faces were so bright mr. jonas had to laugh. he

from gum, and now it was time for it to pass on to some other part of town where, seen 
for the first time, it would be revivified and would revivify others. these tokens of 
exchange were shyly dropped over the rim of the wagon down into unseen riches and 
then the wagon was trundling on, flickering light on its great spindling sunflower wheels 
and mr . . . jonas singing again . . .

singing on it.

tom, driven out of the house by the scorched look on douglas's face, walked slowly 
down to the curb as the wagon stopped. 

"hi, mr. jonas." 

"hello, tom." 

tom and mr. jonas were alone on the street with all that beautiful junk in the wagon 
to look at and neither of them looking at it. mr. jonas didn't say anything right away. he 
lit his pipe and puffed it, nodding his head as if he knew before he asked, that something 
was wrong. 

"tom?" he said. 

"it's my broth

mr. jonas looked up at the house. 
"he's sick," said tom. "he's dying!" 

"oh, now, that can't be so," said mr. jonas, scowling around at the very real world 
where nothing that vaguely looked like death could be found on this quiet day. 

"he's dying," said tom. "and the doctor doesn't know what's wrong. the heat, he said, 
nothing but the heat. can that be, mr. jonas? can the heat kill people, even in a dark 
room?" 

"well," said mr. jonas and stopped. 
for tom was crying now. 

"i always thought i hated him . . .that's what i thought . . .we fight half the time . . .1

"then he didn't get the book of magic tricks he wanted for his birthday, got a pair of 
pants and a shirt instead. that's enough to ruin the summer right there." 

"parents sometimes forget how it is," said mr. jonas.

"i remember years like that," said the junkman. 

he looked off at the sky and there were all the years. 

"so there you are, mr. jonas. that's it. that's why he's dying . . ." 

tom stopped and looked away. 

"let me think," said mr. jonas. 

"can you help, mr. jonas? can you?" 

mr. jonas looked deep in the big old wagon and shook his head. now, in the sunlight, 
his face looked tired and he was beginning to perspire. then he peered into the mounds 
of vases and peeling lamp shades and marble nymphs and satyrs made of greening 
copper. he sighed. he turned and picked up the reins and gave them a gentle shake. 
"tom," he said, looking at the horse's back, "i'll see you later. i got to plan. i got to look 
around and come again after supper. even then, who knows? until then . . ."

resembled a vast hearth over which the shudderings of heat 
moved again and again from the west. charcoal-colored shadows quivered outward from 
every house, every tree. a red-haired man moved along below. tom, seeing him 
illumined by the dying but ferocious sun, saw a torch proudly carrying itself, saw a fiery 
fox, saw the devil marching in his own country. 

at seven-thirty mrs. spaulding came out of the back door of the house to empty some 
watermelon rinds into the garbage pail and saw mr. jonas standing there. "how is the 
boy?" said mr. jonas. 

zsaisa 172 



bradbury, ray - dandelion wine 
mrs. spaulding stood there for a moment, a response trembling on her lips. 
"may i see him, please?" said mr. jonas. 
still she could say nothing. 

"i know the boy well," he said. "seen him most every day of his life since he was out 
and around. i've something for him in the wagon." 

"he's not—" she was going to say "conscious," but she said, "awake. he's not awake, 
mr. jonas. the doctor sa

id he's not to be disturbed. oh, we don't know what's wrong!" 

"even if he's not 'awake,' "said mr. jonas, "i'd like to talk to him. sometimes the 
things you hear in your sleep are more important, you listen better, it gets through." 

"i'm sorry, mr. jonas, i just can't take the chance." mrs. spaulding caught hold of the 
screen-door handle and held fast to it. "thanks. thank you, anyway, for coming by." 

"yes, ma'am," said mr. jonas. 

he did not move. he stood looking up at the window above. mrs. spaulding went in 
the house and shut the screen door. 

upstairs, on his bed, douglas breathed. 

it was a sound like a sharp knife going in and out, in and out, of a sheath. 



at eight o'clock the doctor came and went again shaking his head, his coat off, his tie 
untied, looking as if he had lost thirty pounds that day. at nine o'clock tom and mother 
and father carried a cot outside and brought douglas down to sleep in the

d all its light upon the world, perhaps 
less. but the voice was nearer now and a sound like the beating of a heart which was 
really the motion of a horse's hoofs on the brick streets muffled by the hot thick foliage 
of the trees. 

and there was another sound like a door slowly opening or closing, squeaking, 
squealing softly from time to time. the sound of a wagon. 

and down the street in the light of the risen moon came the horse pulling the wagon 
and the wagon riding the lean body of mr. jonas easy and casual on the high seat. he 
wore his hat as if he were still out under the summer sun and he moved his hands on 
occasion to ripple the reins like a flow of water on the air above the horse's back. very 
slowly the wagon moved down the street with mr. jonas singing, and in his sleep douglas 
seemed for a moment to stop breathing and listen.

at the end of this the wagon was at the curb. and someone stood in the yard, treading 
his shadow, carrying two beetle-green bottles which glittered like cats' eyes. mr. jonas 
looked at the cot there and called the boy's name once, twice, three times, softly. mr. 
jonas swayed in indecision, looked at the bottles he carried, made his decision, and 
moved forward stealthily to sit on the grass and look at this boy crushed down by the 
great weight of summer. 

"doug," he said, "you just lie quiet. you don't have to say anything or open your eyes. 
you don't even have to pretend to listen. but inside there, i know you hear me, and it's

he picked up the other bottle. 

"this one the same, save i've collected a wind from the aran isles and one from off 
dublin bay with salt on it and a strip of flannel fog from the coast of iceland." 

he put the two bottles on the bed. 

"one last direction." he stood by the cot and leaned over and spoke quietly. "when 
you're drinking these, remember: it was bottled by a friend. the s. j. jonas bottling 
company, green town, illinois— august, 1928. a vintage year, boy . . .a vintage year." 

a moment later there was the sound of reins slapping the back of the horse in the

moonlight, and the rumble of the wagon down the street and away. 

after a moment douglas's eyes twitched and, very slowly, opened.

he opened his eyes. he saw bread waiting to be cut into slices of warm summer cloud, 
doughnuts strewn like clown hoops from some edible game. the faucets turned on and 
off in his cheeks. here on the plum-shadowed side of the house with maple leaves 
making a creek-water running in the hot wind at the window he read spice-cabinet 
names. 

how do i thank mr. jonas, he wondered, for what he's done? how do i thank him, how 
pay him back? no way, no way at all. you just can't pay what then? what? pass it on 
somehow, he thought, pass it on to someone else. keep the chain moving. look around, 
find someone, and pass it on. that was the only way . . .

they lingered on toward dawn, with brief desserts, wine from those wild flowers 
growing in the front yard, and then, as the first birds winked to life and the sun 
threatened the eastern sky, they all crept upstairs. douglas listened to the stove cooling 
in the faraway kitchen. he heard grandma go to bed. 

junkman, he thought, mr. jonas, wherever you are, you're thanked, you're paid back. 
i passed it on, i sure did, i think i passed it on . . . 

he slept and dreamed. 

in the dream the bell was ringing and all of them were yelling and rushing down to 
breakfast. 



and then, quite suddenly, summer was over. 

he knew it first when walking downtown. tom grabbed his arm and pointed gasping, 
at the dimestore window. they stood there unable to move because of the things from 
another world displayed so neatly, so innocently, s
