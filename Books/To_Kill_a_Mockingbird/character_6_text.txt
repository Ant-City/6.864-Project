nly was. before the first morning was over, miss caroline fisher, our
teacher, hauled me up to the front of the room and patted the palm of my hand
with a ruler, then made me stand in the corner until noon.
miss caroline was no more than twenty-one. she had bright auburn hair, pink
cheeks, and wore crimson fingernail polish. she also wore high-heeled pumps and
a red-and-white-striped dress. she looked and smelled like a peppermint drop.
she boarded across the street one door down from us in miss maudie atkinson’s
upstairs front room, and when miss maudie introduced us to her, jem was in a
haze for days.
miss caroline printed her name on the blackboard and said, “this says i am miss
caroline fisher. i am from north alabama, from winston county.” the class
murmured apprehensively, should she prove to harbor her share of the
peculiarities indigenous to that region. (when alabama seceded from the union
on january 11, 1861, winston county seceded from alabama, and every child in
maycomb county knew i

walked a total of one mile per school day to avoid the radley place and old mrs.
henry lafayette dubose. mrs. dubose lived two doors up the street from us;
neighborhood opinion was unanimous that mrs. dubose was the meanest old
woman who ever lived. jem wouldn’t go by her place without atticus beside him.
“what you reckon we oughta do, jem?”

finders were keepers unless title was proven. plucking an occasional camellia,
getting a squirt of hot milk from miss maudie atkinson’s cow on a summer day,
helping ourselves to someone’s scuppernongs was part of our ethical culture, but
money was different.
“tell you what,” said jem. “we’ll keep ‘em till school starts, then go around and
ask everybody if they’re theirs. they’re some bus child’s, maybe—he was too
taken up with gettin’ outa school today an‘ forgot ’em. these are somebody’s, i
know that. see how they’ve been slicked up? they’ve been saved.”

the scissors from the sewing-machine drawer when calpurnia’s back was turned,
then sit in the swing and cut up newspapers. dill would walk by, cough at jem,
and jem would fake a plunge into dill’s thigh. from where i stood it looked real.
when mr. nathan radley passed us on his daily trip to town, we would stand still
and silent until he was out of sight, then wonder what he would do to us if he
suspected. our activities halted when any of the neighbors appeared, and once i

saw miss maudie atkinson staring across the street at us, her hedge clippers
poised in midair.
one day we were so busily playing chapter xxv, book ii of one man’s family,
we did not see atticus standing on the sidewalk looking at us, slapping a rolled
magazine against his knee. the sun said twelve noon.
“what are you all playing?” he asked.
“nothing,” said jem.
jem’s evasion told me our game was a secret, so i kept quiet.
“what are you doing with those scissors, then? why are you tearing up that

y him, then he promptly forgot about it. he staked me out, marked
as his property, said i was the only girl he would ever love, then he neglected me.
i beat him up twice but it did no good, he only grew closer to jem. they spent
days together in the treehouse plotting and planning, calling me only when they
needed a third party. but i kept aloof from their more foolhardy schemes for a
while, and on pain of being called a girl, i spent most of the remaining twilights
that summer sitting with miss maudie atkinson on her front porch.
jem and i had always enjoyed the free run of miss maudie’s yard if we kept out
of her azaleas, but our contact with her was not clearly defined. until jem and
dill excluded me from their plans, she was only another lady in the neighborhood,
but a relatively benign presence.
our tacit treaty with miss maudie was that we could play on her lawn, eat her
scuppernongs if we didn’t jump on the arbor, and explore her vast back lot, terms
so generous we seldom spoke to her, so c

 just call up the principal and tell him!” she put her hands on the
wheels of her chair and executed a perfect right face.
“aw, it’s saturday, mrs. dubose,” said jem.
“makes no difference if it’s saturday,” she said obscurely. “i wonder if your
father knows where you are?”
“mrs. dubose, we’ve been goin‘ to town by ourselves since we were this high.”
jem placed his hand palm down about two feet above the sidewalk.
“don’t you lie to me!” she yelled. “jeremy finch, maudie atkinson told me you
broke down her scuppernong arbor this morning. she’s going to tell your father
and then you’ll wish you never saw the light of day! if you aren’t sent to the
reform school before next week, my name’s not dubose!”
jem, who hadn’t been near miss maudie’s scuppernong arbor since last summer,

and who knew miss maudie wouldn’t tell atticus if he had, issued a general
denial.
“don’t you contradict me!” mrs. dubose bawled. “and you—” she pointed an

, it’s like this, scout,” atticus
said. “your aunt’s doing me a favor as well as you all. i can’t stay here all day
with you, and the summer’s going to be a hot one.”
“yes sir,” i said, not understanding a word he said. i had an idea, however, that
aunt alexandra’s appearance on the scene was not so much atticus’s doing as
hers. aunty had a way of declaring what is best for the family, and i suppose
her coming to live with us was in that category.
maycomb welcomed her. miss maudie atkinson baked a lane cake so loaded
with shinny it made me tight; miss stephanie crawford had long visits with aunt
alexandra, consisting mostly of miss stephanie shaking her head and saying,
“uh, uh, uh.” miss rachel next door had aunty over for coffee in the afternoons,
and mr. nathan radley went so far as to come up in the front yard and say he was
glad to see her.
when she settled in with us and life resumed its daily pace, aunt alexandra
seemed as if she had always lived with us. her missionar

y to see. they asked him where he got his name and he said that’s
the way his folks signed him up when he was born.”
as the county went by us, jem gave dill the histories and general attitudes of the
more prominent figures: mr. tensaw jones voted the straight prohibition ticket;

miss emily davis dipped snuff in private; mr. byron waller could play the
violin; mr. jake slade was cutting his third set of teeth.
a wagonload of unusually stern-faced citizens appeared. when they pointed to
miss maudie atkinson’s yard, ablaze with summer flowers, miss maudie herself
came out on the porch. there was an odd thing about miss maudie—on her porch
she was too far away for us to see her features clearly, but we could always catch
her mood by the way she stood. she was now standing arms akimbo, her
shoulders drooping a little, her head cocked to one side, her glasses winking in the
sunlight. we knew she wore a grin of the uttermost wickedness.
the driver of the wagon slowed down his mules, and a shrill-vo

was a dirty yard containing the remains of a model-t ford (on blocks), a
discarded dentist’s chair, an ancient icebox, plus lesser items: old shoes, worn-out
table radios, picture frames, and fruit jars, under which scrawny orange chickens
pecked hopefully.
one corner of the yard, though, bewildered maycomb. against the fence, in a
line, were six chipped-enamel slop jars holding brilliant red geraniums, cared for
as tenderly as if they belonged to miss maudie atkinson, had miss maudie
deigned to permit a geranium on her premises. people said they were mayella
ewell’s.
nobody was quite sure how many children were on the place. some people said
six, others said nine; there were always several dirty-faced ones at the windows
when anyone passed by. nobody had occasion to pass by except at christmas,
when the churches delivered baskets, and when the mayor of maycomb asked us
to please help the garbage collector by dumping our own trees and trash.

“that’s just mr. gilmer’s way, dill, he does ‘em all that way. you’ve never seen
him get good’n down on one yet. why, when—well, today mr. gilmer seemed to
me like he wasn’t half trying. they do ’em all that way, most lawyers, i mean.”
“mr. finch doesn’t.”
“he’s not an example, dill, he’s—” i was trying to grope in my memory for a
sharp phrase of miss maudie atkinson’s. i had it: “he’s the same in the
courtroom as he is on the public streets.”
“that’s not what i mean,” said dill.
“i know what you mean, boy,” said a voice behind us. we thought it came from
the tree-trunk, but it belonged to mr. dolphus raymond. he peered around the
trunk at us. “you aren’t thin-hided, it just makes you sick, doesn’t it?”

“don’t talk like that, dill,” said aunt alexandra. “it’s not becoming to a child. it’s

“i ain’t cynical, miss alexandra. tellin‘ the truth’s not cynical, is it?”
“the way you tell it, it is.”
jem’s eyes flashed at her, but he said to dill, “let’s go. you can take that runner
with you.”
when we went to the front porch, miss stephanie crawford was busy telling it to
miss maudie atkinson and mr. avery. they looked around at us and went on
talking. jem made a feral noise in his throat. i wished for a weapon.
“i hate grown folks lookin‘ at you,” said dill. “makes you feel like you’ve done
something.”
miss maudie yelled for jem finch to come there.
jem groaned and heaved himself up from the swing. “we’ll go with you,” dill
said.
miss stephanie’s nose quivered with curiosity. she wanted to know who all gave
us permission to go to court—she didn’t see us but

“just a minute, scout,” said mr. tate. “mr. finch, did you hear them?”
atticus said he didn’t. he had the radio on. aunt alexandra had hers going in her
bedroom. he remembered because she told him to turn his down a bit so she
could hear hers. atticus smiled. “i always play a radio too loud.”
“i wonder if the neighbors heard anything…” said mr. tate.
“i doubt it, heck. most of them listen to their radios or go to bed with the
chickens. maudie atkinson may have been up, but i doubt it.”
“go ahead, scout,” mr. tate said.
“well, after jem yelled we walked on. mr. tate, i was shut up in my costume but
i could hear it myself, then. footsteps, i mean. they walked when we walked and
stopped when we stopped. jem said he could see me because mrs. crenshaw put
some kind of shiny paint on my costume. i was a ham.”
“how’s that?” asked mr. tate, startled.
atticus described my role to mr. tate, plus the construction of my garment. “you
