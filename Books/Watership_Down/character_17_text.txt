d it out, the
opening would have fallen in and showed no trace of the run inside. and there he
handed us over to another captain -- because he had to go back above ground for
the rest of his spell of duty, you see. we were taken to a big burrow and told to
make ourselves at home.
     "there were other rabbits in the burrow and it was by listening to them and
asking questions that i learned most of what i've been telling you. we got talking
to some of the does and i made friends with one called hyzenthlay.* i told her
about our problem here and why we'd come, and then she told us about efrafa.
when she'd finished i said, 'it sounds terrible. has it always been like this?' she
said no, her mother had told her that in years gone by the warren had been

elsewhere and much smaller, but when general woundwort came, he had made
them move to efrafa and then he'd worked out this whole system of concealment
and perfected it until rabbits in efrafa were as safe as stars in the sky. 'most
rabbits here die

     "so then the owsla took us out to join the right flank mark. apparently
captain bugloss was too busy to see us and i took care to keep out of his way,
because i thought he might want to start marking us then and there. but soon i
began to understand what hyzenthlay had meant when she said the system
wasn't working properly any more. the burrows were overcrowded -- at least by
our standards. it was easy to escape attention. even in one mark the rabbits don't
all know each other. we found places in a burrow and tried to get some sleep, but
early in the night we were woken and told to silflay. i thought there might be a
chance to run for it in the moonlight, but there seemed to be sentries everywhere.
and besides the sentries, the captain kept two runners wi

r then and there to believe that
he was her secret friend and that he hated efrafa and the authority which he
represented. nelthilta's rejoinder to chervil in the run had been full of hatred, but
this doe's gaze spoke of wrongs beyond her power to express. as bigwig stared
back at her, he suddenly recalled holly's description of the great yellow hrududu
that had torn open the earth above the destroyed warren. "that might have met a
look like this," he thought. then the doe answered, "my name is hyzenthlay, sir."
     "hyzenthlay?" said bigwig, startled out of his self-possession. "then it was you
who--" he stopped. it might be dangerous to ask whether she remembered
speaking to holly. but whether she did or not, here, evidently, was the rabbit who
had told holly and his companions about the troubles of efrafa and the
discontent of the does. if he remembered holly's story rightly, she had already
made some sort of attempt to leave the warren. "but," he thought, as he met once
more her desolate ey

     he thought until he realized that he was thinking in circles. after a time, he fell
asleep. when he woke, he could tell that it was moonlight outside, fine and still. it
occurred to him that perhaps he might start his venture from the other end -- by
persuading some of the does to join him and working out a plan afterward,
perhaps with their help. he went down the run until he came upon a young rabbit
sleeping as best he could outside an overcrowded burrow. he woke him.
     "do you know hyzenthlay?" he asked.
     "oh, yes, sir," replied the rabbit, with a rather pathetic attempt to sound brisk
and ready.
     "go and find her and tell her to come to my burrow," said bigwig. "no one else
is to come with her. do you understand?"
     "yes, sir."
     when the youngster had scurried off, bigwig returned to his burrow,
wondering whether there would be any suspicion. it seemed unlikely. from what
chervil had said, it was common enough for efrafan officers to send for does. if
he were questio

ned he had only to play up. he lay down and waited.
     in the dark, a rabbit came slowly up the run and stopped at the entrance to the
burrow. there was a pause.
     "hyzenthlay?" said bigwig.
     "i am hyzenthlay."
     "i want to talk to you," said bigwig.
     "i am in the mark, sir, and under your orders. but you have made a mistake."
     "no, i haven't," replied bigwig. "you needn't be afraid. come in here, close
beside me."
     hyzenthlay obeyed. he could feel her fast pulse. her body was tense: her eyes
were closed and her claws dug into the floor.
     "hyzenthlay," whispered bigwig in her ear, "listen carefully. you remember
that many days ago now, four rabbits came to efrafa in the evening. one had very
pale gray fur and one had a healed rat bite in his foreleg. you talked with their
leader -- his name was holly. i know what he told you."
     she turned her head in fear. "how do you know?"
     "never mind. only listen to m

e."
     then bigwig spoke of hazel and fiver; of the destruction of the sandleford
warren and the journey to watership down. hyzenthlay neither moved nor
interrupted.
     "the rabbits who talked to you that evening," said bigwig, "who told you about
the warren that was destroyed and of how they had come to ask for does from
efrafa -- do you know what became of them?"
     hyzenthlay's reply was no more than the faintest murmur in his ear.

     "i know what i heard. they escaped the next evening. captain charlock was
killed pursuing them."
     "and was any other patrol sent after them, hyzenthlay? the next day, i mean?"
     "we heard that there was no officer to spare, with bugloss under arrest and
charlock dead."
     "those rabbits returned to us safely. one of them is not far away now, with our
chief rabbit and several more. they are cunning and resourceful. they are

waiting for me to bring does out of efrafa -- as many as i can get to come. i shall
be able to send them a message tomorrow morning."
     "how?"
     "by a bird -- if all goes well." bigwig told her about kehaar. when he had
finished, hyzenthlay made no reply and he could not tell whether she was
considering all that he had said or whether fear and disbelief had so troubled her
that she did not know what to say. did she think he was a spy trying to trap her?
did she perhaps wish only that he would let her go away? at last he said,
     "do you believe me?"
     "yes, i believe you."
     "might i not be a spy sent by the council?"
     "you are not. i can tell."
     "how?"
     "you spoke of your friend -- the one who knew that that w

become foolish -- tales for kittens on a summer evening. no, i cannot see as i did
once: it is like the shapes of trees beyond a field of rain."
     "well, you'd better come and meet this friend of mine," said bigwig. "he talks
just like that, and i've come to trust him, so i trust you, too. if you feel we're going
to succeed, that's fine. but what i'm asking is whether you'll bring your friends to
join us."
     after another silence, hyzenthlay said, "my courage -- my spirit: it's so much
less than it was. i'm afraid to let you rely on me."
     "i can tell that. what is it that's worn you down? weren't you the leader of the
does who went to the council?"
     "there was myself and thethuthinnang. i don't know what's happened to the
other does who were with us. we were all in the right fore mark then, you know.

     "yes, of course."

needed most of all: a strong, sensible friend who would think on her own account
and help to bear his burden.
     "i'll leave it to you to pick the does," he said. "i can make the chance to run if
you'll have them ready to take it."
     "when?"
     "sunset will be best, and the sooner the better. hazel and the others will meet
us and fight any patrol that follows. but the main thing is that the bird will fight
for us. even woundwort won't be expecting that."
     hyzenthlay was silent again and bigwig realized with admiration that she was
going over what he had said and searching for flaws.
     "but how many can the bird fight?" she said at last. "can he drive them all
away? this is going to be a big break-out and, make no mistake, thlayli, the
general himself will be after us with the best rabbits he has. we can't go on
running away forever. they won't lose track of us and sooner or later they'll
overtake us."
     "i told you our rabbits were more cunning than

     "what is a river?"
     "well, there you are. i can't explain. but i promise you we shan't have to run
far. we shall actually disappear before the owsla's eyes -- if they're there to see. i
must say i'm looking forward to that."
     she said nothing and he added, "you must trust me, hyzenthlay. upon my life,
we're going to vanish. i'm not deceiving you."
     "if you were wrong, those who died quickly would be the lucky ones."
     "no one's going to die. my friends have prepared a trick that el-ahrairah
himself would be proud of."
     "if it is to be at sunset," she said, "it must be tomorrow or the next night. in

," he said. "sentries are out already. does the thunder worry
you?"
     "it does rather," replied bigwig.
     "it won't break today," said chervil. "it's a long way off yet. i'd give it until
tomorrow evening. anyway, don't let the mark see it affects you. nothing's to be
altered unless the general says so."
     "couldn't wake him up," said avens, with a touch of malice. "there was a doe
in your burrow last night, thlayli, wasn't there?"
     "oh, was there?" said chervil. "which one?"
     "hyzenthlay," replied bigwig.
     "oh, the marli tharn,"* said chervil. "funny, i didn't think she was ready."
     "she wasn't," said bigwig. "i made a mistake. but if you remember, you asked
me to do what i could to get to know the awkward squad and bring them a bit
more under control, so i kept her talking for a time, just the same."
     "get anywhere?"
     "hard to say, really," said bigwig, "but i'll keep at it."
     he spent the time while the mark went out in deciding upon the best and

     "whatever for?"
     "because it's unusual. everything unusual has to be reported. if we don't
report it and someone else does, nice fools we shall look when we have to say we
saw it. we couldn't say we didn't -- several of the mark have seen it. in fact, i shall
go and report it now. silflay's nearly over, so if i'm not back in time, you and
avens had better see the mark underground yourselves."
     as soon as chervil had left him, bigwig went to look for hyzenthlay. he found
her in the hollow with thethuthinnang. most of the mark did not appear to be
unduly affected by the thunder, which was still distant, as chervil had said. the
two does, however, were subdued and nervous. bigwig told them what he had
arranged with kehaar.
     "but will this bird really attack the sentries?" asked thethuthinnang. "i've
never heard of anything like that."

and went underground with them. their officers shared a single large burrow and
here he met some experienced veterans and listened with interest to their stories
of wide patrols and other exploits. in the mid-afternoon he came back to the
near hind relaxed and confident, and slept until one of the sentries woke him for
silflay.
     he went up the run. blackavar was already slumped in his alcove. squatting
beside chervil, bigwig watched the mark go out. hyzenthlay and thethuthinnang
passed him without a glance. they looked tense but steady. chervil followed the
last rabbit.
     bigwig waited until he was sure that chervil had had time to get well away
from the hole. then, with a last, quick look to where blackavar was sitting, he
went out himself. the bright sunset dazzled him and he sat up on his hind legs,
blinking and combing the fur along one side of his face as his eyes got accustomed
to the light. a few moments later he saw kehaar come flying acro

myself. it will cross the iron road and try to pick up traces of those rabbits -- the
rabbits mallow would have found if you hadn't gone and blundered into him. so
you'd better come along and show us how good you are then."
     "very well, sir; i shall be glad to."
     there was another silence. this time bigwig decided to make as if to go. he did
so, and immediately a fresh question stopped him short.
     "when you were with hyzenthlay, did she tell you why she was put into the
near hind mark?"
     "yes, sir."
     "i'm not at all sure the trouble's over there, thlayli. keep an eye on it. if she'll
talk to you, so much the better. perhaps those does are settling down and perhaps
they aren't. i want to know."
     "very well, sir," said bigwig.
     "that's all," said woundwort. "you'd better get back to your mark now."
     bigwig made his way into the field. the silflay was almost over, the sun had set
and it was growing da

back over the river now, before it's completely dark."
     "hazel-rah," said pipkin, as he slipped by, "it -- it is going to be all right, isn't
it? bigwig will come tomorrow, won't he?"
     "of course he will," said hazel, "and we'll all be here to help him. and i'll tell
you something else, hlao-roo. if he doesn't come tomorrow, i'm going into efrafa
myself."
     "i'll come with you, hazel-rah," said pipkin.

          -<*>-

     bigwig crouched in his burrow, pressed against hyzenthlay. he was trembling,
but not with cold: the stuffy runs of the mark were dense with thunder; the air
felt like a deep drift of leaves. bigwig was close to utter nervous exhaustion. since
leaving general woundwort, he had become more and more deeply entangled in
all the age-old terrors of the conspirator. how much had woundwort discovered?
clearly, there was no information that failed to reach him. he knew that hazel
and the rest had come from the north and crossed the iron road. he knew about
the

 fox. he knew that a gull, which should have been far away at this time of year,
was hanging round efrafa and that he, bigwig, had deliberately been near it. he
knew that bigwig had made a friend of hyzenthlay. how long could it be before
he took the final step of fitting all these things together? perhaps he had already
done so and was merely waiting to arrest them in his own time?
     woundwort had every advantage. he sat secure at the junction of all paths,
seeing clearly down each, while he, bigwig, ludicrous in his efforts to measure up
to him as an enemy, clambered clumsily and ignorantly through the
undergrowth, betraying himself with every movement. he did not know how to

get in touch with

 kehaar again. even if he managed to do so, would hazel be able
to bring the rabbits a second time? perhaps they had already been spotted by
campion on patrol? to speak to blackavar would be suspect. to go near kehaar
would be suspect. through more holes than he could possibly stop, his secret was
leaking -- pouring -- out.
     there was worse to come.
     "thlayli," whispered hyzenthlay, "do you think you and i and thethuthinnang
could get away tonight? if we fought the sentry at the mouth of the run, we might
be able to get clear before a patrol could start after us."
     "why?" asked bigwig. "what makes you ask that?"
     "i'm frightened. we told the other does, you see, just before the silflay. they
were ready to run when the bird attacked the sentries, and then nothing
happened. they all know about the plan -- nelthilta and the rest -- and it can't be
long before the cou

huthinnang. keep
thinking of those high downs and all that i told you. we'll get there -- our
troubles won't last much longer."
     as she fell asleep beside him, bigwig wondered how on earth he was going to
fulfill this promise and whether they would be woken by the council police. "if we
are," he thought, "i'll fight until they tear me to bits. they'll make no blackavar
out of me."

          -<*>-

     when he woke, he found that he was alone in the burrow. for a moment he
wondered whether hyzenthlay had been arrested. then he felt sure that the
owslafa could not have removed her while he slept. she must have woken and
slipped back to thethuthinnang without disturbing him.
     it was a little before dawn, but the oppression in the air had not lessened. he
slipped up the run to the entrance. moneywort, the sentry on duty, was peering
uneasily out of the mouth of the hole, but turned as he approached.

     "i wish it would rain, sir," he said. "the thunder's enough to turn the grass
sour,

     "that's not allowed, sir," said one of the escort.
     "oh, let him have it, bartsia," said the other. "there's no one to see. it's hard
enough for everyone on a day like this, let alone the prisoner."
     blackavar ate the clover and bigwig took up his usual place as chervil arrived
to watch the mark go out.
     the rabbits were slow and hesitant and chervil himself seemed unable to rise
to his usual brisk manner. he had little to say as they passed him. he let both
thethuthinnang and hyzenthlay go by in silence. nelthilta, however, stopped of
her own accord and stared impudently at him.
     "under the weather, captain?" she said "brace up, now. you may have a
surprise soon, who knows?"
     "what do you mean?" answered chervil sharply.
     "does might grow wings and fly," said nelthilta, "and before very much longer,
too. secrets go faster than moles underground."
     she followed the other does into the field. for a moment chervil looked as
though he were going to call her back.

r as long as the escort -- clearly in no hurry themselves -- would allow.
     "sir," said bartsia, as bigwig came in, "that's the third time, sir, that you've
disregarded my authority. council police can't be treated in this way. i'm afraid i
shall have to report it, sir."
     bigwig made no reply and returned up the run.
     "wait a bit longer if you can," he said as he passed the bucks. "i don't suppose
that poor fellow will get out again today."
     he wondered whether to go and look for hyzenthlay, but decided that it would
be prudent to keep away from her. she knew what to do, and the less they were
seen together the better. his head ached in the heat and he wanted only to be
alone and quiet. he went back to his burrow and slept.

warren again. i think this is going to be a rough business," he added quietly to
hazel. "i don't like it much."

          -<*>-

     bigwig woke to hear his name repeated urgently.
     "thlayli! thlayli! wake up! thlayli!"
     it was hyzenthlay.
     "what is it?" he said. "what's the matter?"
     "nelthilta's been arrested."
     bigwig leaped to his feet.
     "how long ago? how did it happen?"
     "just now. moneywort came down to our burrow and told her to come up to
captain chervil at once. i followed them up the run. when she got to chervil's
burrow, there were two council police waiting just outside and one of them said
to chervil, 'well, as quick as you can, and don't be long.' and then they took her
straight out. they must

she'll tell them everything--"
     "listen to me," said bigwig. "there's not a moment to lose. go and get
thethuthinnang and the others and bring them up to this burrow. i shan't be
here, but you must wait quietly until i come back. it won't be long. quick now!
everything depends on it."
     hyzenthlay had hardly disappeared down the run when bigwig heard another
rabbit approaching from the opposite direction.
     "who's there?" he said, turning swiftly.
     "chervil," answered the other. "i'm glad you're awake. listen, thlayli, there's
going to be a whole lot of trouble. nelthilta's been arrested by the council. i was
sure she would be, after my report to vervain this morning. whatever it was she
was talking about, they'll get it out of her. i dare say the general will be here

 to get on with it at once."
     he waited for marjoram's reply. if chervil had already told him that no one
was to go out, it would be necessary to fight him. but after a moment marjoram
said, "have you heard any thunder yet?"
     "get on with it at once, i said," answered bigwig. "go down and get blackavar
and the escort up, and be quick, too. we'll need to get the mark out immediately
if they're to feed before the storm breaks."
     marjoram went and bigwig hurried back to his own burrow. hyzenthlay had
lost no time. three or four does were crammed into the burrow itself and nearby,
in a side run, thethuthinnang was crouching with several more. all were silent
and frightened and one or two were close to the stupefaction of terror.
     "this is no time to go tharn," said bigwig. "your lives depend on doing as i say.
listen, now. blackavar and the police guards will be up directly. marjoram will
probably come up behind them and you must find some excuse to keep him
talking. soon after, you'

. he felt
bartsia's closed teeth come tearing out through his flesh and then he was
standing above him as he fell back on the ground, kicking helplessly. bigwig
leaped clear. it was plain that bartsia's haunch was injured. he struggled, but
could not get up.
     "think yourself lucky," said bigwig, bleeding and cursing, "that i don't kill
you."

     without waiting to see what bartsia would do, he jumped back into the hole.
he found blackavar grappling with the other guard. just beyond them,
hyzenthlay was coming up the run with thethuthinnang behind her. bigwig gave
the guard a tremendous cuff on the side of the head, which knocked him clear
across the run and into the prisoner's alcove. he picked himself up, panting, and
stared at bigwig without a word.
     "don't move," said bigwig. "there'll be worse to come if you do. blackavar, are
you all right?"
     "yes, sir," said blackavar, "but what do we do now?"
     "follow me," said bigwig, "all of you. come on!"
     he led the way out agai

ackavar nearby and ran across to him.
     "i want everyone the other side of that hedge," he said. "can you get hold of
some of them and bring them that way?"
     bigwig remembered that blackavar knew nothing except that they were on the
run. there was no time to explain about hazel and the river.
     "go straight to that ash tree in the hedge," he said, "and take all the does you
can pick up on the way. get through to the other side and i'll be there as soon as
you are."
     at this moment hyzenthlay and thethuthinnang came running toward them,
followed by two or three other does. they were plainly confused and uncertain.

     "the stamping, thlayli!" panted thethuthinnang. "they're coming!"
     "well, run, then," said bigwig. "keep near me, all of you."
     they were better runners than he had dared to hope. as they made for the ash
tree, more does fell in with them and it seemed to him that they ought now to be a
match for a patrol, unless it were a very strong one. once through the h

of him, was the arch in the overgrown embankment. but would hazel be there?

     "well, and what was to happen after that, nelthilta?" asked general
woundwort. "make sure you tell us everything, because we know a good deal
already. let her alone, vervain," he added. "she can't talk if you keep cuffing her,
you fool."
     "hyzenthlay said -- oh! oh! -- she said a big bird would attack the owsla
sentries," gasped nelthilta, "and we would run away in the confusion. and then--"
     "she said a bird would attack the sentries?" interrupted woundwort, puzzled.
"are you telling the truth? what sort of a bird?"
     "i don't -- i don't know," panted nelthilta. "the new officer -- she said he had

     "no, it shan't come to that," said bigwig to himself. "at the worst we can cross
the river and try to hide in the woodland. confound this shoulder! it's going to be
more nuisance than i thought. well, i'll try to get them down to the plank bridge
at least. if we're not overtaken soon, perhaps the rain will discourage whoever's
after us; but i doubt it."
     he turned back to the does waiting under the arch. most of them looked
bewildered. hyzenthlay had promised that they were to be protected by a great
bird and that the new officer was going to work a secret trick to evade the pursuit
-- a trick which would defeat even the general. these things had not happened.
they were wet through. runnels of water were trickling through the arch from
the uphill side, and the bare earth was beginning to turn into mud. ahead of them
there was nothing to be seen but a track leading through the nettles into another
wide and empty field.

ws of dissolution. then the rain fell like a waterfall. in a
few seconds the ground was covered with water and over it, to a height of inches,
rose a haze formed of a myriad minute splashes. stupefied with the shock, unable
even to move, the sodden rabbits crouched inert, almost pinned to the earth by
the rain.
     a small voice spoke in bigwig's mind.
     "your storm, thlayli-rah. use it."
     gasping, he struggled up and pushed blackavar with his foot.
     "come on," he said, "get hold of hyzenthlay. we're going."
     he shook his head, trying to blink the rain out of his eyes. then it was no
longer blackavar who was crouching in front of him but woundwort, drenched in
mud and rain, glaring and scrabbling in the silt with his great claws.
     "i'll kill you myself," said woundwort.
     his long front teeth were bared like the fangs of a rat. afraid, bigwig watched
him closely. he knew that woundwort, with all the advantage of weight, would
jump and try to close with him. he must try to

     bigwig ran behind him and came out on the green path by the bank. all the
surface of the river was winking and plopping in the rain. the level did not appear
to have risen much as yet. the boat was just as he remembered it -- one end
against the bank, the other a little way out in the stream. on the raised part at the
near end hazel was crouching, his ears drooping on either side of his head and his
flattened fur completely black with rain. he was holding the taut rope in his
teeth. acorn, hyzenthlay and two more were crouching near him on the wood,
but the rest were huddled here and there along the bank. blackberry was trying
unsuccessfully to persuade them to get out on the boat.
     "hazel's afraid to leave the rope," he said to bigwig. "apparently he's bitten it
very thin already. all these does will say is that you're their officer."
     bigwig turned to thethuthinnang.
     "this is the magic trick now," he said. "get them over there, where
hyzenthlay's sitting, do you see? all of t

re all wondering what to do next," said hazel.
     "well," said blackberry, "i suppose we shall drift into the bank before long and
then we can get out and find cover. there's no harm, though, in going a good long
way from those friends of bigwig's."
     "there is," said hazel. "we're stuck here in full view and we can't run. if a man
sees us we're in trouble."
     "men don't like rain," said blackberry. "neither do i, if it comes to that, but it
makes us safer just now."
     at this moment hyzenthlay, sitting just behind him, started and looked up.
     "excuse me, sir, for interrupting you," she said, as though speaking to an
officer in efrafa, "but the bird -- the white bird -- it's coming toward us."
     kehaar came flying up the river through the rain and alighted on the narrow
side of the punt. the does nearest to him backed away nervously.
     "meester 'azel," he said, "pridge come. you see 'im pridge?"
     it had not occurred to any of the rabbits that they were floating beside th

low had sent him flying. however, though dazed and bruised, he seemed
to have escaped injury.
     "i wasn't quick enough, hazel-rah," he said. "i'd better go to efrafa for a bit."
     "you'd be wasted," said hazel. "but i'm afraid there's someone at the other end
who hasn't been so lucky."
     one of the does had held back from the bilgewater, and the upstream girder
under the bridge had caught her across the back. it was plain that she was
injured, but how badly hazel could not tell. he saw hyzenthlay beside her and it
seemed to him that since there was nothing he could do to help, it would probably
be best to let them alone. he looked round at his bedraggled, shivering comrades
and then at kehaar, spruce and brisk on the stem.
     "we ought to get back on the bank, kehaar," he said. "how can we do it?
rabbits weren't meant for this, you know."
     "you not stop poat. but again is nudder pridge more. 'e stop 'im."
     there was nothing to be done but wait. they drifted on and came to a se

n the edge of the bow. then, on the instant, all the
rabbits froze motionless. one of the does stamped on the puddled floor of the
punt. from above came the sounds of approaching footsteps and men's voices,
and the smell of a burning white stick.
     kehaar flew away. not a rabbit moved. the footsteps grew nearer, the voices
louder. they were on the bridge above, no further away than the height of a
hedge. every one of the rabbits was seized by the instinct to run, to go
underground. hazel saw hyzenthlay looking at him and returned her stare,
willing her with all his might to keep still. the voices, the smell of men's sweat, of

leather, of white sticks, the pain in his leg, the damp, chuckling tunnel at his very
ear -- he had known them all before. how could the men not see him? they must
see him. he was lying at their feet. he was wounded. they were coming to pick
him up.
     then the sounds and smells were receding into the distance, the thudding of
the footsteps diminished. the men had cr

     bigwig was still lying in the bilgewater, in the place he had taken up when they
came to the first bridge. he seemed to be asleep, but when silver nuzzled him he
raised his head and looked about in a dazed manner.

     "oh, hello, silver," he said. "i'm afraid this shoulder of mine's going to be a
bother. i feel awfully cold, too. where's hazel?"
     silver explained. bigwig got up with difficulty and they saw that he was still
bleeding. he limped to the thwart and climbed on it.
     "hyzenthlay," he said, "your friends can't be any wetter, so we'll get them to
jump in now. one by one, don't you think? then there'll be no risk of them
scratching or hurting each other as they swim."
     in spite of what blackavar had said, it was a long time before everyone had left
the boat. there were in fact ten does altogether -- though none of the rabbits
knew the number -- and although one or two responded to bigwig's patient
urging, several were so much exhausted that they remained huddled where

to give them. captain mallow, to whose mark -- the right fore -- he had been
sent on trial, had praised his courage and endurance but had not failed to notice
the proud detachment of his nature. when the right flank needed a junior officer
to help captain chervil, it was avens and not blackavar who had been selected by

the council. blackavar, who knew his own worth, felt convinced that his mother's
blood had prejudiced the council against him. while still full of his wrongs he
had met hyzenthlay and made himself a secret friend and adviser of the
discontented does in the right fore. he had begun by urging them to try to get
the council's consent to their leaving efrafa. if they had succeeded they would
have asked for him to be allowed to go with them. but when the does' deputation
to the council failed, blackavar turned to the idea of escape. at first he had meant
to take the does with him, but his nerve, strained to the limit, as bigwig's had
been, by the dangers and uncertainties of

or
whom, naturally, blackavar entertained a tremendous respect -- to see that he did
not overreach himself in his warm-hearted, rather candid zeal.
     after two or three days of slow, careful journeying, with many halts in cover,
they found themselves, late one afternoon, once more in sight of caesar's belt,
but further west than before, close to a little copse at the top of some rising
ground. everyone was tired and when they had fed -- "evening silflay every day,
just as you promised," said hyzenthlay to bigwig -- bluebell and speedwell
suggested that it might be worthwhile to dig some scrapes in the light soil under
the trees and live there for a day or two. hazel felt willing enough, but fiver
needed persuasion.
     "i know we can do with a rest, but somehow i don't altogether like it, hazel-
rah," he said. "i suppose i've got to try to think why?"
     "not on my account," answered hazel. "but i doubt you'll shift the others this
time. one or two of these does are 'ready for mudder,' as

that homba won't be hunting any more for some time. i suggest we all move on
as soon as we can."
     with a word of agreement, hazel went out to call the rabbits together. they
made a scattered but swift run to the northeast, along the edge of a field of
ripening wheat. no one spoke of the doe. they had covered more than three
quarters of a mile before bigwig and hazel halted to rest and to make sure that no
one had fallen behind. blackavar came up with hyzenthlay, bigwig said,
     "you told us how it would be, didn't you? and i was the one who wouldn't
listen."
     "told you?" said blackavar. "i don't understand."
     "that there was likely to be a fox."
     "i don't remember, i'm afraid. but i don't see that any of us could possibly
have known. anyway, what's a doe more or less?"
     bigwig looked at him in astonishment, but blackavar, apparently unconcerned
either to stress what he had said or to break off the talk, simply began to nibble

ss. bigwig, puzzled moved away and himself began to feed a little distance
off, with hyzenthlay and hazel.
     "what's he getting at?" he asked after a while. "you were all there when he
warned us, two nights ago, that there was likely to be a fox. i treated him badly."
     "in efrafa," said hyzenthlay, "if a rabbit gave advice and the advice wasn't
accepted, he immediately forgot it and so did everyone else. blackavar thought
what hazel decided; and whether it turned out later to be right or wrong was all
the same. his own advice had never been given."
     "i can believe that," said bigwig. "efrafa! ants led by a dog! but we're not in
efrafa now. has he really forgotten that he warned us?"
     "probably he really has. but whether or not, you'd never get him to admit that
he warned you or t

do that than pass hraka underground."
     "but you're an efrafan. do you think like that, too?"

          -<*>-

     during the early afternoon they began to approach the belt and bigwig was the
first to recognize the place where dandelion had told the story of the black rabbit
of inlé.
     "it was the same fox, you know," he said to hazel. "that's almost certain. i
ought to have realized how likely it was that--"
     "look here," said hazel, "you know very well what we owe to you. the does all
think el-ahrairah sent you to get them out of efrafa. they believe no one else

awake above the drowsing downs. the beech leaves grew darker on the boughs
and fresh grass grew where the old had been nibbled close. the warren was
thriving at last and hazel could sit basking on the bank and count their blessings.
above and under ground, the rabbits fell naturally into a quiet, undisturbed
rhythm of feeding, digging and sleeping. several fresh runs and burrows were
made. the does, who had never dug in their lives before, enjoyed the work. both
hyzenthlay and thethuthinnang told hazel that they had had no idea how much
of their frustration and unhappiness in efrafa had been due simply to not being
allowed to dig. even clover and haystack found that they could manage pretty
well and boasted that they would bear the warren's first litters in burrows that
they had dug themselves. blackavar and holly became close friends. they talked a
great deal about their different ideas of scouting and tracking, and made some
patrols together, more for their own

 any
rabbits who felt discontented could always go back to efrafa; and the thought of
all that they had faced together was enough to take the sting out of anything that
might have made a real quarrel. the contentment of the does spread to everyone
else, until one evening hazel remarked that he felt a perfect fraud as chief rabbit,
for there were no problems and hardly a dispute to be settled.
     "have you thought about the winter yet?" asked holly.
     four or five of the bucks, with clover, hyzenthlay and vilthuril, were feeding
along the sunny west side of the hanger about an hour before sunset. it was still
hot and the down was so quiet that they could hear the horses tearing the grass in
the paddock of cannon heath farm, more than half a mile away. it certainly did
not seem a time to think of winter.
     "it'll probably be colder up here than any of us have been used to," said hazel.
"but the soil's so light and the roots break it up so much that we can dig a lot
deeper before the cold w

d thorough. then they have to dig us out. the
warren's deep. it's under a bank, with tree roots all through it and over the top.
how long can all those rabbits stay on the down without attracting elil? they'll
have to give it up."
     "you don't know these efrafans," said blackavar. "my mother used to tell me
what happened at nutley copse. it would be better to go now."
     "well, go on, then," answered hazel. "i'm not stopping you. and i'm not
leaving this warren. it's my home." he looked at hyzenthlay, heavy with young,
who was sitting in the mouth of the nearest hole and listening to the talk. "how
far do you think she'll get? and clover -- do we leave her or what?"

     "no, we must stay," said strawberry. "i believe el-ahrairah will save us from
this woundwort; and if he doesn't, i'm not going back to efrafa, i'll tell you that."
     "fill in the holes," said hazel.
     as the sun set, the rabbits fell to clawing and scrabbling in the runs. the sides
were hard with the hot weather. it

e's a lot of ground above us there and the roots
will hold them up for a long time. but down this end it's easier for them. they're
bound to dig through fairly soon. then the roof will come in; and i can't see that
we can do anything to stop them."
     hazel could feel him trembling as he spoke. as the sounds of digging
continued, he sensed fear spreading all through the burrow. "they'll take us back
to efrafa," whispered vilthuril to thethuthinnang. "the warren police--"
     "be quiet," said hyzenthlay. "the bucks aren't talking like that and why should
we? i'd rather be here now, as we are, than never have left efrafa."
     it was bravely said, but hazel was not the only one who could tell her thoughts.
bigwig remembered the night in efrafa when he had calmed her by talking of the
high downs and the certainty of their escape. in the dark, he nuzzled hazel's
shoulder and pressed him over to one side of the wide burrow.
     "listen, hazel," he said, "we're not finished yet. not by a long way

oneycomb; and for many days afterward he was still improving
upon his imitation of captain fiver at the head of his crowd of efrafan prisoners
-- "like a tomtit rounding up a bunch of molting jackdaws," as he put it.

     no one was inclined to pay them much attention at the time, however, for the
only thoughts throughout the warren were for hazel and bigwig. bigwig seemed
likely to die. bleeding in half a dozen places, he lay with closed eyes in the run he
had defended and made no reply when hyzenthlay told him that the efrafans
were defeated and the warren was saved. after a time, they dug carefully to
broaden the run and as the day wore on the does, each in turn, remained beside
him, licking his wounds and listening to his low, unsteady breathing.
     before this, blackberry and dandelion had burrowed their way in from
kehaar's run -- it had not been blocked very heavily -- and told their story. they
could not say what might have happened to hazel after the dog broke loose, and

ce when fiver, sitting up on an anthill to
look about, saw a rabbit approaching over the high ground to the west. they both
ran nearer and recognized hazel. fiver went to meet him while pipkin raced back
to the honeycomb with the news.
     as soon as he had learned all that had happened -- including what groundsel
had to tell -- hazel asked holly to take two or three rabbits and find out for
certain whether the efrafans had really gone. then he himself went into the run
where bigwig was lying. hyzenthlay looked up as he came.
     "he was awake a little while ago, hazel-rah," she said. "he asked where you
were; and then he said his ear hurt very much."
     hazel nuzzled the matted fur cap. the blood had turned hard and set into
pointed spikes that pricked his nose.
     "you've done it, bigwig," he said. "they've all run away."
     for several moments bigwig did not move. then he opened his eyes and raised
his head, pouching out his cheeks and sniffing at the two rabbits beside him. he

sank down, rested, got up again and reached the foot of kehaar's run.
     "i thought he'd killed me," he said. "no more fighting for me -- i've had
enough. and you -- your plan worked, hazel-rah, did it? well done. tell me what
it was. and how did you get back from the farm?"
     "a man brought me in a hrududu," said hazel, "nearly all the way."
     "and you flew the rest, i suppose," said bigwig, "burning a white stick in your
mouth? come on, tell me sensibly. what's the matter, hyzenthlay?"
     "oh!" said hyzenthlay, staring. "oh!"
     "what is it?"
     "he did!"
     "did what?"
     "he did ride home in a hrududu. and i saw him as he came -- that night in
efrafa, when i was with you in your burrow. do you remember?"

it to fiver. that's a good idea -- let's go and do it. and if he'll believe you, hazel-

world of which he had once spoken to hazel during the late june days they had
spent together at the foot of the down. it was bigwig who said -- one evening
when fiver was absent from the honeycomb at story time -- that fiver was one
who had paid more dearly than even himself for the night's victory over the
efrafans. yet to his doe, vilthuril, fiver was devotedly attached, while she had
come to understand him almost as deeply as ever hazel had.
     just outside the beech hanger, hyzenthlay's litter of four young rabbits were
playing in the grass. they had first been brought up to graze about seven days
before. if hyzenthlay had had a second litter she would by this time have left
them to look after themselves. as it was, however, she was grazing close by,
watching their play and every now and then moving in to cuff the strongest and
stop him bullying the others.
     "they're a good bunch, you know," said holly. "i hope we get some more like
those."
     "we can't expect many mor

e until toward the end of the winter," said hazel,
"though i dare say there'll be a few."
     "we can expect anything, it seems to me," said holly.
     "three litters born in autumn -- have you ever heard of such a thing before?
frith didn't mean rabbits to mate in the high summer."
     "i don't know about clover," said hazel. "she's a hutch rabbit: it may be
natural to her to breed at any time, for all i know. but i'm sure that hyzenthlay
and vilthuril started their litters in the high summer because they'd had no
natural life in efrafa. for all that, they're the only two who have had litters, as
yet."
     "frith never meant us to go out fighting in the high summer, either, if that
comes to that," said silver. "everything that's happened is unnatural -- the
fighting, the breeding -- and all on account of woundwort. if he wasn't unnatural,
who was?"
     "bigwig was right when he said he wasn't like a rabbit at all," said holly.

holes at the northeast corner of the hanger. "he'll turn up one of these days,
when the storms begin on that big water of his. he can take a message to
campion as quickly as you'd run down to the iron tree and back."
     "by frith in the leaves, and i know someone who'll be glad to see him!" said
silver. "someone not so very far away."
     they had reached the eastern end of the trees and here, well out in the open
where it was still sunny, a little group of three young rabbits -- bigger than
hyzenthlay's -- were squatting in the long grass, listening to a hulking veteran,
lop-eared and scarred from nose to haunch -- none other than bigwig, captain of
a very free-and-easy owsla. these were the bucks of clover's litter and a likely lot
they looked.
     "oh, no, no, no, no," bigwig was saying. "oh, my wings and beak, that won't
do! you -- what's your name -- scabious -- look, i'm a cat and i see you down at
the bottom of my garden chewing up the lettuces. now, what do i do? do i come
