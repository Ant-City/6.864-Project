tom  asked,  "where's  uncle  john?  where's  rosasharn?  where's  ruthie  an' 

winfield? nobody said nothin' about them yet." 

pa said, "nobody asked. john gone to sallisaw with a load a stuff to sell: pump, 
tools,  chickens,  an'  all  the  stuff  we  brung  over.  took  ruthie  an'  winfield  with  'im. 
went 'fore daylight." 

"funny i never saw him," said tom. 
"well, you come down from the highway, didn't you? he took the back way, by 
cowlington. an' rosasharn, she's nestin' with connie's folks. by god! you don't even 
know rosasharn's married to connie rivers. you 'member connie. nice young fella. 
an' rosasharn's due 'bout three-four-five months now. swellin' up right now. looks 
fine." 

"jesus!"  said  tom.  "rosasharn  was  just a  little  kid.  an'   now  she's  gonna  have  a 
baby. so damn much happens in four years if you're away. when ya think to start out 
west, pa?" 

"well, we got to take this stuff in an' sell it. if al gets back from his squirtin' aroun',

you folks." and then he stood, embarrassed by his own speech. 

ma looked to tom to speak, because he was a man, but tom did not speak. she let 
him have the chance that was his right, and then she said, "why, we'd be proud to have 
you. 'course i can't say right now; pa says all the men'll talk tonight and figger when 
we gonna start. i guess maybe we better not say till all the men come. john an' pa an' 
noah an' tom an' grampa an' al an' connie, they're gonna figger soon's they get back. 
but if they's room i'm pretty sure we'll be proud to have ya." 

the preacher sighed. "i'll go anyways," he said. "somepin's happening. i went up 
an' i looked, an' the houses is all empty, an' the lan' is empty, an' this whole country is 
empty. i can't stay here no more. i got to go where the folks is goin'. i'll work in the

body—full soft breasts and stomach, hard hips and buttocks that had swung so freely 
and  provocatively  as  to  invite  slapping  and  stroking—her  whole  body  had  become 
demure and serious. her whole thought and action were directed inward on the baby. 
she balanced on her toes now, for the baby's sake. and the world was pregnant to her; 
she thought only in terms of reproduction and of motherhood. connie, her nineteen-
year-old husband, who had married a plump, passionate hoyden, was still frightened 
and bewildered at the change in her; for there were no more cat fights in bed, biting 
and  scratching  with  muffled  giggles  and  final  tears.  there  was  a  balanced,  careful, 
wise creature who smiled shyly but very firmly at him. connie was proud and fearful 
of rose of sharon. whenever he could, he put a hand on her or stood close, so that his 
body touched her at hip and shoulder, and h

they shouted, "where is he? where's tom?" and then they saw him standing beside 
the door, and they stopped, embarrassed, and walked slowly toward him and looked 
shyly at him. 

and  when  he  said,  "hello,  how  you  kids  doin'?"  they  replied  softly,  "hello!  all 
right." and they stood apart and watched him secretly, the great brother who had killed 
a man and been in prison. they remembered how they had played prison in the chicken 
coop and fought for the right to be prisoner. 

connie  rivers  lifted  the  high  tail-gate  out  of  the  truck  and  got  down  and  helped 
rose  of  sharon  to  the  ground;  and  she  accepted  it  nobly,  smiling  her  wise,  self-
satisfied smile, mouth tipped at the corners a little fatuously. 

tom said, "why, it rosasharn. i didn't know you was comin' with them." 
"we was walkin'," she said. "the truck come by an' picked us up." and then she 

said, "this is connie, my husband." and she was grand, saying it.

the lower, left, knee; the right elbow on the right knee, and the right fist cupped for the 
chin.  pa  squatted  there,  looking  at  the  truck,  his  chin  in  his  cupped  fist.  and  uncle 
john  moved  toward  him  and  squatted  down  beside  him.  their  eyes  were  brooding. 
grampa came out of the house and saw the two squatting together, and he jerked over 
and sat on the running board of the truck, facing them. that was the nucleus. tom and 
connie and noah strolled in and squatted, and the line was a half-circle with grampa 
in the opening. and then ma came out of the house, and granma with her, and rose of 
sharon behind, walking daintily. they took their places behind the squatting men; they 
stood  up  and  put  their  hands  on  their  hips.  and  the  children,  ruthie  and  winfield, 
hopped from foot to foot beside the women; the children squidged their toes in the red 
dust, but they made no sound. only the preacher was not there

pa dug his stick into the dust and rolled it between his fingers so that it bored a little 
hole. "they's more to this than is he lucky, or is he a nice fella," pa said. "we got to 
figger  close.  it's  a  sad  thing  to  figger  close.  le's  see,  now.  there's  grampa  an' 
granma—that's  two.  an'  me  an'  john  an'  ma—that's  five.  an'  noah  an'  tommy  an'

"not countin' what chickens is left, an' two pigs," said noah. 
pa  said,  "i  aim  to  get  those  pigs  salted  down  to  eat  on  the  way.  we  gonna  need

pa  sat  on  the  doorstep  and  looked  at  the  pigs  hanging  in  the  lantern  light.  the 
scraping  was  done  now,  and  only  a  few  drops  of  blood  continued  to  fall  from  the 
carcasses into the black pool on the ground. pa got up and went to the pigs and felt 
them with his hand, and then he sat down again. granma and grampa went toward the 
barn to sleep, and grampa carried a candle lantern in his hand. the rest of the family 

sat quietly about the doorstep, connie and al and tom on the ground, leaning their 
backs against the house wall, uncle john on a box. pa in the doorway. only ma and 
rose of sharon continued to move about. ruthie and winfield were sleepy now, but 
fighting  it  off.  they  quarreled  sleepily  out  in  the  darkness,  noah  and  the  preacher 
squatted side by side, facing the house. pa scratched himself nervously, and took off 
his hat and ran his fingers through his hair. "tomorra we'll get that pork salted early in 
the morning,

beside him, so that the weight of the heavy canvas would not be upon him. 

"i got to get that ridge pole fixed," al said. "do her tonight when we stop." grampa 
grunted and fought weakly against awakening, and when he was finally settled he went 
deeply to sleep again. 

pa said, "ma, you an' granma set in with al for a while. we'll change aroun' so it's 
easier, but you start out that way." they got into the cab, and then the rest swarmed up 
on  top  of  the  load,  connie  and  rose  of  sharon,  pa  and  uncle  john,  ruthie  and 
winfield, tom and the preacher. noah stood on the ground, looking up at the great 
load of them sitting on top of the truck. 

al walked around, looking underneath at the springs. "holy jesus," he said, "them 

springs is flat as hell. lucky i blocked under' em." 

noah said, "how about the dogs, pa?" 
"i forgot the dogs," pa said. he whistled shrilly, and one bouncing dog ran in, but 
only  one.  noah  caught  him  and  threw  him

en he came to the low brush he pulled up short. ma threw the 
door  open  and  half  pulled  the  struggling  old  lady  out  beside  the  road  and  into  the 
bushes. and ma held her so granma would not fall when she squatted. 

on top of the truck the others stirred to life. their faces were shining with sunburn 
they could not escape. tom and casy and noah and uncle john let themselves wearily 
down.  ruthie  and  winfield  swarmed  down  the  side-boards  and  went  off  into  the 
bushes. connie helped rose of sharon gently down. under the canvas, grampa was 
awake, his head sticking out, but his eyes were drugged and watery and still senseless. 
he watched the others, but there was little recognition in his watching. 

tom called to him, "want to come down, grampa?" 
the  old  eyes  turned  listlessly  to  him.  "no,"  said  grampa.  for  a  moment  the 
fierceness came into his eyes. "i ain't a-goin', i tell you. gonna stay like muley." and 
then he lost interest again. ma came back,

sideways at tom. 

the  fat  man  stared  hopelessly  straight  ahead.  his  hand  started  turning  the  crank 

slowly. "i dunno what we're comin' to," he said softly. 

over by the water hose, connie and rose of sharon stood together, talking secretly. 
connie washed the tin cup and felt the water with his finger before he filled the cup 
again. rose of sharon watched the cars go by on the highway. connie held out the cup 
to her. "this water ain't cool, but it's wet," he said. 

she looked at him and smiled secretly. she was all secrets now she was pregnant, 
secrets and little silences that seemed to have meanings. she was pleased with herself, 
and she complained about things that didn't

 really matter. and she demanded services 
of connie that were silly, and both of them knew they were silly. connie was pleased 
with her too, and filled with wonder that she was pregnant. he liked to think he was in 
on the secrets she had. when she smiled slyly, he smiled slyly too, and they exchanged 
confidences in whispers. the world had drawn close around them, and they were in the 
center  of  it,  or  rather  rose  of  sharon  was  in  the  center  of  it  with  connie  making  a 
small orbit about her. everything they said was a kind of secret. 

she drew her eyes from the highway. "i ain't very thirsty," she said daintily. "but 

maybe i ought to drink." 

and he nodded, for he knew well what she meant. she took the cup and rinsed her 

mouth and spat and then drank the cupful of tepid water. "want another?" he asked. 

"jus' a half." and so he filled the cup just half, and gave it to her. a lincoln zephyr, 
silvery and low, whisked by. she turned to see wh

connie  sighed,  "maybe—after."  they  both  knew  what  he  meant.  "an'  if  they's 
plenty  work  in  california,  we'll  git  our  own  car.  but  them"—he  indicated  the 
disappearing zephyr—"them kind costs as much as a good size house. i ruther have the

"i like to have the house an' one a them," she said. "but 'course the house would be

the pregnancy.

oss, and then started over. rose of sharon 

screamed  shrilly.  a  big  swift  car  whisked  near,  tires  squealed.  the  dog  dodged 
helplessly, and with a shriek, cut off in the middle, went under the wheels. the big car 
slowed for a moment and faces looked back, and then it gathered greater speed and 
disappeared. and the dog, a blot of blood and tangled, burst intestines, kicked slowly 
in the road. 

rose of sharon's eyes were wide. "d'you think it'll hurt?" she begged. "think it'll 

connie put his arm around her. "come set down," he said. "it wasn't nothin'." 
"but i felt it hurt. i felt it kinda jar when i yelled." 
"come set down. it wasn't nothin'. it won't hurt." he led her to the side of the truck 

away from the dying dog and sat her down on the running board. 

tom and uncle john walked out to the mess. the last quiver was going out of the 
crushed body. tom took it by the legs and dragged it to the side of the road. uncle 
john looked embarrassed, as though it were his fa

strangeness, and it frightened them with the fine-clothed people they saw. they did not 
speak of it to each other. later—they would, but not now. they saw the oil derricks in 
the town, on the edge of the town; oil derricks black, and the smell of oil and gas in the 
air. but they didn't exclaim. it was so big and so strange it frightened them. 

in the street rose of sharon saw a man in a light suit. he wore white shoes and a 
flat  straw  hat.  she  touched  connie  and  indicated  the  man  with  her  eyes,  and  then 
connie and rose of sharon giggled softly to themselves, and the giggles got the best of 
them. they covered their mouths. and it felt so good that they looked for other people 
to giggle at. ruthie and winfield saw them giggling and it looked such fun that they 
tried to do it too—but they couldn't. the giggles wouldn't come. but connie and rose

man  slept  in  a  bunk  high  up  against  the  ceiling.  but  the  trucks  never  stopped;  they 
thundered day and night and the ground shook under their heavy march. 

the family became a unit. pa squatted down on the ground, and uncle john beside 
him. pa was the head of the family now. ma stood behind him. noah and tom and al 
squatted, and the preacher sat down, and then reclined on his elbow. connie and rose 
of sharon walked at a distance. now ruthie and winfield, clattering up with a bucket 
of  water  held  between  them,  felt  the  change,  and  they  slowed  up  and  set  down  the 
bucket and moved quietly to stand with ma. 

granma sat proudly, coldly, until the group was formed, until no one looked at her, 
and then she lay down and covered her face with her arm. the red sun set and left a 
shining twilight on the land, so that faces were bright in the evening and eyes shone in

wrote." 

on  the  edge  of  the  ring  of  firelight  the  men  had  gathered.  for  tools  they  had  a 
shovel and a mattock. pa marked out the ground—eight feet long and three feet wide. 
the work went on in relays. pa chopped the earth with the mattock and then uncle 
john  shoveled  it  out.  al  chopped  and  tom  shoveled.  noah  chopped  and  connie 
shoveled.  and  the  hole  drove  down,  for  the  work  never  diminished  in  speed.  the 
shovels of dirt flew out of the hole in quick spurts. when tom was shoulder deep in 
the rectangular pit, he said, "how deep, pa?" 

"good  an'  deep.  a  couple  feet  more.  you  get  out  now,  tom,  and  get  that  paper 

tom boosted himself out of the hole and noah took his place. tom went to ma, 

where she tended the fire. "we got any paper an' pen, ma?"

"don't like to pray?" 
"no," said tom. "he ain't a preacher no more. he figgers it ain't right to fool people 
actin' like a preacher when he ain't a preacher. i bet he went away so nobody wouldn' 
ast him." 

casy  had  come  quietly  near,  and  he  heard  tom  speaking.  "i  didn'  run  away,"  he 

said. "i'll he'p you folks, but i won't fool ya." 

"i'll say 'em," said the preacher. 
connie  led  rose  of  sharon  to  the  graveside,  she  reluctant.  "you  got  to,"  connie 

said. "it ain't decent not to. it'll jus' be a little." 

the  firelight  fell  on  the  grouped  people,  showing  their  faces  and  their  eyes, 
dwindling on their dark clothes. all the hats were off now. the light danced, jerking 
over the people.

his fingertips. he said, "ma favors a white house with oranges growin' around. they's

texas. the land turtles crawled through the dust and the sun whipped the earth, and in 
the evening the heat went out of the sky and the earth sent up a wave of heat from 
itself. 

two days the families were in flight, but on the third the land was too huge for them 
and they settled into a new technique of living; the highway became their home and 
movement their medium of expression. little by little they settled into the new life. 
ruthie and winfield first, then al, then connie and rose of sharon, and, last, the older 
ones.  the  land  rolled  like  great  stationary  ground  swells.  wildorado  and  vega  and 
boise and glenrio. that's the end of texas. new mexico and the mountains. in the far 
distance, waved up against the sky, the mountains stood. and the wheels of the cars 
creaked around, and the engines were hot, and the steam spurted around the radiator 
caps. they crawled to the pecos river, and crossed at santa rosa. and they went on for 
twenty miles.

"i  will—but  he's  a  queer  man.  maybe  it's  him  made  me  tell  them  people  they

right to do." ma looked at her hands and then she said, "rosasharn, we got to sleep. 'f 
we're gonna go tonight, we got to sleep." she stretched out on the ground beside the 
mattress. 

rose of sharon asked, "how about fannin' granma?" 
"she's asleep now. you lay down an' rest." 
"i wonder where at connie is?" the girl complained. "i ain't seen him around for a 

long time." 

ma said, "sh! get some rest." 
"ma, connie gonna study nights an' get to be somepin." 
"yeah. you tol' me about that. get some rest." 
the girl lay down on the edge of granma's mattress. "connie's got a new plan. he's 
thinkin' all a time. when he gets all up on 'lectricity he gonna have his own store, an' 
then guess what we gonna have?" 

"what?"

"connie's thinkin' all a time," ma chuckled. "better get some rest now." 
rose of sharon closed her eyes. ma turned over on her back and crossed her hands 
under  her  head.  she  listened  to  granma's  breathing  and  to  the  girl's  breathing.  she 
moved a hand to start a fly from her forehead. the camp was quiet in the blinding heat, 
but the noises of hot grass—of crickets, the hum of flies—were a tone that was close to 
silence. ma sighed deeply and then yawned and closed her eyes. in her h

ground and placed the pork pan over them. "that's where they'll be," she said. "if you 
don' get 'em, somebody else will." wilson, his head still down, turned and went to his 
tent; he stepped inside and the flaps fell behind him. 

for a few moments the family waited, and then, "we got to go," said tom. "it's near 

four, i bet." 

the family climbed on the truck, ma on top, beside granma. tom and al and pa in 
the seat, and winfield on pa's lap. connie and rose of sharon made a nest against the 
cab. the preacher and uncle john and ruthie were in a tangle on the load. 

pa called, "good-by, mister and mis' wilson." there was no answer from the tent. 
tom  started  the  engine  and  the  truck  lumbered  away.  and  as  they  crawled  up  the 
rough road toward needles and the highway, ma looked back. wilson stood in front of 
his tent, staring after them, and his hat was in his hand. the sun fell full on his face. 
ma waved her hand at him, b

ruthie said, "wouldn' leave you set up there, huh?" 
"i didn' want to. it wasn't so nice as here. couldn' lie down." 
"well, don' you bother me, a-squawkin' an' a-talkin'," ruthie said, "'cause i'm goin' 
to sleep, an' when i wake up, we gonna be there! 'cause tom said so! gonna seem 
funny to see pretty country." 

the sun went down and left a great halo in the sky. and it grew very dark under the 

tarpaulin, a long cave with light at each end—a flat triangle of light. 

connie and rose of sharon leaned back against the cab, and the hot wind tumbling 
through  the  tent  struck  the  backs  of  their  heads,  and  the  tarpaulin  whipped  and 
drummed  above  them.  they  spoke  together  in  low  tones,  pitched  to  the  drumming 
canvas, so that no one could hear them. when connie spoke he turned his head and 
spoke into her ear, and she did the same to him. she said, "seems like we wasn't never 
gonna do nothin' but move. i'm so tar'd."

"i don' know." 
"you think it was a sin to let my wife die like that?" 
"well," said casy, "for anybody else it was a mistake, but if you think it was a sin—

then it's a sin. a fella builds his own sins right up from the groun'." 

"i got to give that goin'-over," said uncle john, and he rolled on his back and lay 

with his knees pulled up. 

the truck moved on over the hot earth, and the hours passed. ruthie and winfield 
went to sleep. connie loosened a blanket from the load and covered himself and rose 
of sharon with it, and in the heat they struggled together, and held their breaths. and 
after a time connie threw off the blanket and the hot tunneling wind felt cool on their 
wet bodies. 

on the back of the truck ma lay on the mattress beside granma, and she could not 
see with her eyes, but she could feel the struggling body and the struggling heart; and 
the sobbing breath was in her ear. and ma said over and over, "all right.

hie and winfield scrambled down from the car, and then they stood, silent and 
awestruck, embarrassed before the great valley. the distance was thinned with haze, 
and the land grew softer and softer in the distance. a windmill flashed in the sun, and 

its turning blades were like a little heliograph, far away. ruthie and winfield looked at 
it, and ruthie whispered, "it's california." 

winfield moved his lips silently over the syllables. "there's fruit," he said aloud. 
casy and uncle john, connie and rose of sharon climbed down. and they stood 
silently. rose of sharon had started to brush her hair back, when she caught sight of 
the valley and her hand dropped slowly to her side. 

tom said, "where's ma? i want ma to see it. look, ma! come here, ma." ma was 
climbing slowly, stiffly, down the back board. tom looked at her. "my god, ma, you

her head, and the rims were red with weariness. her feet touc

away from the body as they could get, stared at the tucked figure. 

and ruthie whispered, "tha's granma, an' she's dead." 
winfield nodded solemnly. "she ain't breathin' at all. she's awful dead." 
and rose of sharon said softly to connie, "she was a-dyin' right when we—" 
"how'd we know?" he reassured her.

because he was sorry. he plumped down beside casy and uncle john. "well, she was

the  family  on  top of the load, the children and connie and rose of sharon 
and  the  preacher  were  stiff  and  cramped.  they  had  sat  in  the  heat  in  front  of  the 
coroner's office in bakersfield while pa and ma and uncle john went in. then a basket 
was brought out and the long bundle lifted down from the truck. and they sat in the 
sun  while  the  examination  went  on,  while  the  cause  of  death  was  found  and  the 
certificate signed.

"i'll stay," said casy. 
"an' tomorra we'll go out in the truck an' look for work." 
"yeah!" said casy, and he waved his toes up and down and studied them gravely. 
tom settled back on his elbow and closed his eyes. inside the tent he could hear the 
murmur of rose of sharon's voice and connie's answering. 

the tarpaulin made a dark shadow and the wedge-shaped light at each end was hard 
and sharp. rose of sharon lay on a mattress and connie squatted beside her. "i oughta 
help ma," rose of sharon said. "i tried, but ever' time i stirred about i throwed up." 

connie's eyes were sullen. "if i'd of knowed it would be like this i wouldn' of came.

pa nodded his head slowly at ma's words. "she's right," he said. "it gives a fella 

relief to tell, but it jus' spreads out his sin." 

uncle john looked up to the sun-gold mountains, and the mountains were reflected 
in his eyes. "i wisht i could run it down," he said. "but i can't. she's a-bitin' in my 
guts." 

behind him rose of sharon moved dizzily out of the tent. "where's connie?" she 

asked irritably. "i ain't seen connie for a long time. where'd he go?" 
"i ain't seen him," said ma. "if i see 'im, i'll tell 'im you want 'im." 
"i ain't feelin' good," said rose of sharon. "connie shouldn' of left me." 
ma looked up to the girl's swollen face. "you been a-cryin'," she said.

down through the willows, and they were angry at al.

stopped  them.  they  came  near  to  the  tent  flap  and  squatted  down.  floyd  raised  the

"what's the matter now?"

his nose tenderly and waggled it around to stop an itch. "seems like you people always 
lost somebody," he said. "ten times a day or more somebody comes in here an' says, 
'if you see a man named so an' so, an' looks like so an' so, will you tell 'im we went up

tom laughed. "well, if you see a young snot-nose name' connie, looks a little bit 
like a coyote, tell 'im to go to hell. we've went south. but he ain't the fella i'm lookin' 
for. did a fella 'bout sixty years ol', black pants, sort of grayish hair, come in here an' 
get some whisky?" 

the eyes of the gray man brightened. "now he sure did. i never seen anything like

he brought the dusty broken hat from under the counter.

tom asked, "where's rosasharn?" 
"over there," said ma. "come on, rosasharn. we're a-goin'."

rose of sharon said sullenly, "i don' feel good: i wisht connie would come. i don't

"tom was on'y jollyin' ya." 
"i know. i didn't mind; on'y i hate to have folks look at me." 
"ain't no way to he'p that. folks gonna look. but it makes folks happy to see a girl
