ronic tone to that final message,
as if the speaker found it amusing; and jonas had smiled a little,
though he knew what a grim statement it had been. for a
contributing citizen to be released from the community was a final
decision, a terrible punishment, an overwhelming statement of
failure.



even the children were scolded if they used the term lightly at play,
jeering at a teammate who missed a catch or stumbled in a race.
jonas had done it once, had shouted at his best friend, "that's it,
asher! you're released!" when asher's clumsy error had lost a
match for his team. he had been taken aside for a brief and serious
talk by the coach, had hung his head with guilt and embarrassment,
and apologized to asher after the game.

now, thinking about the feeling of fear as he pedaled home along
the river path, he remembered that moment of palpable, stomach-
sinking terror when the aircraft had streaked above. it was not what
he was feeling now with december approaching. he searched for





th

e right word to describe his own feeling.

jonas was careful about language. not like his friend, asher, who
talked too fast and mixed things up, scrambling words and phrases
until they were barely recognizable and often very funny.

jonas grinned, remembering the morning that asher had dashed
into the classroom, late as usual, arriving breathlessly in the middle
of the chanting of the morning anthem. when the class took their
seats at the conclusion of the patriotic hymn, asher remained
standing to make his public apology as was required.

"i apologize for inconveniencing my learning community." asher ran
through the standard apology phrase rapidly, still catching his
breath. the instructor and class waited patiently for his explanation.
the students had all been grinning, because they had listened to
asher's explanations so many times before.

"i left home at the correct time but when i was riding



along near the hatchery, the crew was separating some salmon. i

ss i just got distraught, watching them.

"i apologize to my classmates," asher concluded. he smoothed his
rumpled tunic and sat down.

"we accept your apology, asher." the class recited the standard
response in unison. many of the students were biting their lips to
keep from laughing.

"i accept your apology, asher," the instructor said. he was smiling.
"and i thank you, because once again you have provided an
opportunity for a lesson in language. 'distraught' is too strong an



adjective to describe salmon-viewing." he turned and wrote
"distraught" on the instructional board. beside it he wrote
"distracted."

jonas, nearing his home now, smiled at the recollection. thinking,
still, as he wheeled his bike into its narrow port beside the door, he
realized that frightened was the wrong word to describe his

"andrei later designed the bridge that crosses the river to the west

"there are very rarely disappointments, jonas. i don't think you
need to worry about that," his father reassured him. "and if there
are, you know there's an appeal process." but they all laughed at
that--an appeal went to a committee for study.

"i worry a little about asher's assignment," jonas confessed.
"asher's such fun. but he doesn't really have any serious interests.
he makes a game out of everything."

his father chuckled. "you know," he said, "i remember when asher
was a newchild at the nurturing center, before he was named. he
never cried. he giggled and laughed at everything. all of us on the
staff enjoyed nurturing asher."

"the elders know asher," his mother said. "they'll find exactly the
right assignment for him. i don't think you need to worry about

fe, and the training you'll receive in your
assignment."

"i know that," jonas said. "everyone knows that."

"but it means," his mother went on, "that you'll move into a new
group. and each of your friends will. you'll no longer be spending
your time with your group of elevens. after the ceremony of
twelve, you'll be with your assignment

group, with those in training. no more volunteer hours. no more
recreation hours. so your friends will no longer be as close."

jonas shook his head. "asher and i will always be friends," he said
firmly. "and there will still be school."

"that's true," his father agreed. "but what your mother said is true
as well. there will be changes."

"good changes, though," his mother pointed out. "after my
ceremony of twelve, i missed my childhood recreation. but when i
entered my training for law and justice, i found myself with people
who shared my interests. i made friends on a new level, friends of
all ages."

"did you still play at all, after twelve?" j

ncident. he was still bewildered by
it. not by the announcement or the necessary apology; those were
standard procedures, and he had deserved them-but by the
incident itself. he probably should have brought up his feeling of
bewilderment that very evening when the family unit had shared
their feelings of the day. but he had not been able to sort out and
put words to the source of his confusion, so he had let it pass.



it had happened during the recreation period, when he had been
playing with asher. jonas had casually picked



r



24



up an apple from the basket where the snacks were kept, and had
thrown it to his friend. asher had thrown it back, and they had
begun a simple game of catch.

there had been nothing special about it; it was an activity that he
had performed countless times: throw, catch; throw, catch. it was
effortless for jonas, and even boring, though asher enjoyed it, and
playing catch was a required activity for asher because it would
improve his hand-eye coordinatio
 
 ___________________________
 
-well, this
was the part that he couldn't adequately understand-the apple had
changed. just for an instant. it had changed in mid-air, he
remembered. then it was in his hand, and he looked at it carefully,
but it was the same apple. unchanged. the same size and shape:
a perfect sphere. the same nondescript shade, about the same
shade as his own tunic.

there was absolutely nothing remarkable about that apple. he had
tossed it back and forth between his hands a few times, then
thrown it again to asher. and again~in the air, for an instant only-it
had changed.

it had happened four times. jonas had blinked, looked around, and
then tested his eyesight, squinting at the small print on the
identification badge attached to his tunic. he read his name quite
clearly. he could also clearly see asher at the other end of the
throwing area. and he had had no problem catching the apple.





jonas had been completely mystified.

"ash?" he had called. "does anything seem strange to you? about
the apple?"
 
 ___________________________
 


"yes," asher called back, laughing. "it jumps out of



25



my hand onto the ground!" asher had just dropped it once again.

so jonas laughed too, and with his laughter tried to ignore his
uneasy conviction that something had happened. but he had taken
the apple home, against the recreation area rules. that evening,
before his parents and lily arrived at the dwelling, he had held it in
his hands and looked at it carefully. it was slightly bruised now,
because asher had dropped it several times. but there was nothing
at all unusual about the apple.

he had held a magnifying glass to it. he had tossed it several times
across the room, watching, and then rolled it around and around on
his desktop, waiting for the thing to happen again.

but it hadn't. the only thing that happened was the announcement
later that evening over the speaker, the announcement that had
singled him out without using his name, that had caused both of his
parents to glance meaningfull

the evening proceeded as all evenings did in the family unit, in the
dwelling, in the community: quiet, reflective, a time for renewal and
preparation for the day to come. it was different only in the addition
to it of the newchild with his pale, solemn, knowing eyes.

jonas rode at a leisurely pace, glancing at the bikeports beside the
buildings to see if he could spot asher's. he didn't often do his
volunteer hours with his friend because asher frequently fooled
around and made serious work a little difficult. but now, with twelve
coming so soon and the volunteer hours ending, it didn't seem to
matter.

the freedom to choose where to spend those hours had always
seemed a wonderful luxury to jonas; other hours of the day were
so carefully regulated.

he remembered when he had become an eight, as lily would do
shortly, and had been faced with that freedom of choice.

omplishments because
such a conversation would have been awkward for benjamin.
there was never any comfortable way to mention or discuss one's
successes without breaking the rule against bragging, even if one
didn't mean to. it was a minor rule, rather like rudeness, punishable
only by gentle chastisement. but still. better to steer clear of an
occasion governed by a rule which would be so easy to break.

the area of dwellings behind him, jonas rode past the community
structures, hoping to spot asher's bicycle parked beside one of the
small factories or office buildings. he passed the childcare center
where lily stayed after school, and the play areas surrounding it.
he rode through the central plaza and the large auditorium where
public meetings were held.

jonas slowed and looked at the nametags on the bicycles lined up
outside the nurturing center. then he checked those outside food
distribution; it was always fun to help with the deliveries, and he
hoped he would find his friend there s

o that they could go together
on the daily rounds, carrying the cartons of supplies into the
dwellings of the community. but he finally found asher's bicycle-
leaning, as usual, instead of upright in its port, as it should have
been-at the house of the old.





there was only one other child's bicycle there, that of a female
eleven named fiona. jonas liked fiona. she was a good student,
quiet and polite, but she had a sense of fun as well, and it didn't
surprise him that she was working with asher today. he parked his
bicycle neatly in the port beside theirs and entered the building.

"hello, jonas," the attendant at the front desk said. she handed him
the sign-up sheet and stamped her own official seal beside his
signature. all of his volunteer hours would be carefully tabulated at
the hall of open records. once, long ago, it was whispered among
the children, an eleven had arrived at the ceremony of twelve only
to hear a public announcement that he had not completed the
required number

of volunteer hours and would not, therefore, be
given his assignment. he had been permitted an additional month
in which to complete the hours, and then given his assignment
privately, with no applause, no celebration: a disgrace that had
clouded his entire future.

"it's good to have some volunteers here today," the attendant told
him. "we celebrated a release this morning, and that always throws
the schedule off a little, so things get backed up." she looked at a
printed sheet. "let's see. asher and fiona are helping in the
bathing room. why don't you join them there? you know where it is,
don't you?"

jonas nodded, thanked her, and walked down the long hallway. he
glanced into the rooms on either side. the old were sitting quietly,
some visiting and talking with one another, others doing handwork
and simple crafts. a few were asleep. each room was comfortably
furnished, the floors covered with thick carpeting. it was a serene

 the
hall. "hello, jonas," the young uniformed man said, smiling
pleasantly. the woman beside him, whose arm he held, was
hunched over as she shuffled along in her soft slippers. she looked
toward jonas and smiled, but her dark eyes were clouded and
blank. he realized she was blind.

he entered the bathing room with its warm moist air and scent of
cleansing lotions. he removed his tunic, hung it carefully on a wall
hook, and put on the volunteer's smock that was folded on a shelf.

"hi, jonas!" asher called from the corner where he was kneeling
beside a tub. jonas saw fiona nearby, at a different tub. she
looked up and smiled at him, but she was busy, gently washing a
man who lay in the warm water.

jonas greeted them and the caretaking attendants at work nearby.
then he went to the row of padded lounging chairs where others of
the old were waiting. he had worked here before; he knew what to
do.

"your turn, larissa," he said, reading the nametag on





the woman's robe. "i'll just start t

 in his mind. "i think i was in the bathing room at the
house of the old."

"that's where you were yesterday," father pointed out.

jonas nodded. "but it wasn't really the same. there was a tub, in
the dream. but only one. and the real bathing room has rows and
rows of them. but the room in the dream was warm and damp. and
i had taken off my tunic, but hadn't put on the smock, so my chest
was bare. i was perspiring, because it was so warm. and fiona





was there, the way she was yesterday."

"asher, too?" mother asked.

jonas shook his head. "no. it was only me and fiona, alone in the
room, standing beside the tub. she was laughing. but i wasn't. i
was almost a little angry at her, in the dream, because she wasn't
taking me seriously."

"seriously about what?" lily asked.

jonas looked at his plate. for some reason that he didn't
understand, he felt slightly embarrassed. "i think i

was trying to convince her that she should get into the tub of water."

he paused. he knew he had t

dream?



38



but his mother laughed again in a reassuring, affectionate way.
"no, no," she said. "it's just the pills. you're ready for the pills, that's
all. that's the treatment for stirrings."

jonas brightened. he knew about the pills. his parents both took
them each morning. and some of his friends did, he knew. once he
had been heading off to school with asher, both of them on their
bikes, when asher's father had called from their dwelling doorway,
"you forgot your pill, asher!" asher had groaned good-naturedly,
turned his bike, and ridden back while jonas waited.

it was the sort of thing one didn't ask a friend about because it
might have fallen into that uncomfortable category of "being
different." asher took a pill each morning; jonas did not. always
better, less rude, to talk about things that were the same.

now he swallowed the small pill that

 his mother handed him.





"that's all?" he asked.

"that's all," she replied, returning the bottle to the cupboard. "but
you mustn't forget. i'll remind you for the first weeks, but then you
must do it on your own. if you forget, the stirrings will come back.
the dreams of stirrings will come back. sometimes the dosage
must be adjusted."

"asher takes them," jonas confided.

his mother nodded, unsurprised. "many of your groupmates
probably do. the males, at least. and they all will, soon. females
too."

"how long will i have to take them?"

"until you enter the house of the old," she explained.

"all of your adult life. but it becomes routine; after a while you won't
even pay much attention to it."

she looked at her watch. "if you leave right now, you won't even be
late for school. hurry along.

"and thank you again, jonas," s

 sadness. even
jonas, though he didn't hover over the little one the way lily and his
father did, was glad that gabe had not been released.

the first ceremony began right on time, and jonas watched as one
after another each newchild was given a name and handed by the
nurturers to its new family unit. for some, it was a first child. but
many came to the stage accompanied by another child beaming
with pride to receive a little brother or sister, the way jonas had
when he was about to be a five.

asher poked jonas's arm. "remember when we got phillipa?" he
asked in a loud whisper. jonas nodded. it had only been last year.
asher's parents had waited quite a long time before applying for a
second child. maybe, jonas suspected, they had been so
exhausted by asher's lively foolishness that they had needed a little
time.

two of their group, fiona and another female named thea, were
missing temporarily, waiting with their parents to receive
newchildren. but it was rare that there was such an age g

between children in a family unit.



when her family's ceremony was completed, fiona took the seat
that had been saved for her in the row ahead of asher and jonas.
she turned and whispered to them, "he's cute. but i don't like his
name very much." she made a face and giggled. fiona's new
brother had been



44



named bruno. it wasn't a great name, jonas thought, like-well, like
gabriel, for example. but it was okay.

the audience applause, which was enthusiastic at each naming,
rose in an exuberant swell when one parental pair, glowing with
pride, took a male newchild and heard him named caleb.

this new caleb was a replacement child. the cou

day there had been merriment
at lunch, a lot of teasing and energy. but today the group stood
anxiously, separate from the other children. jonas watched the new
nines gravitate toward their waiting bicycles, each one admiring his
or her nametag. he saw the tens stroking their new shortened hair,
the females shaking their heads to feel the unaccustomed lightness
without the heavy braids they had worn so long.

"i heard about a guy who was absolutely certain he was going to be
assigned engineer," asher muttered as they ate, "and instead they
gave him sanitation laborer. he went out the next day, jumped into
the river, swam across, and joined the next community he came to.
nobody ever saw him again."

jonas laughed. "somebody made that story up, ash," he said. "my
father said he heard that story when he was a twelve."

but asher wasn't reassured. he was eyeing the river where it was
visible behind the auditorium. "i can't even swim very well," he said.




"my swimming instructor said that i d

"buoyancy," jonas corrected him.

"whatever. i don't have it. i sink."

"anyway," jonas pointed out, "have you ever once known of
anyone-l mean really known for sure, asher, not just heard a story
about it-who joined another community?"

"no," asher admitted reluctantly. "but you can. it says so in the
rules. if you don't fit in, you can apply for elsewhere and be
released. my mother says that once, about ten years ago, someone
applied and was gone the next day." then he chuckled. "she told
me that because i was driving her crazy. she threatened to apply
for elsewhere."

"she was joking."

"i know. but it was true, what she said, that someone did that once.
she said that it was really true. here today and gone tomorrow.

higher intelligence than
his father; but his father had a calmer disposition. they balanced
each other. their match, which like all matches had been monitored
by the committee of elders for three years before they



49



could apply for children, had always been a successful one.

like the matching of spouses and the naming and placement of
newchildren, the assignments were scrupulously thought through
by the committee of elders.

he was certain that his assignment, whatever it was to be, and
asher's too, would be the right one for them. he only wished that
the midday break would conclude, that the audience would reenter
the auditorium, and the suspense would end.

as if in answer to his unspoken wish, the signal came and the
crowd began to move toward the doors.



50



now jonas's group had taken a new place in the auditorium,
trading with the new elevens, so that they sat in the very front,
immediately before the stage.

they were arranged by their original numbers, the numbers they
h

er was eleven-nineteen,



51



since there were other nineteens, of course, in each age group.
and today, now that the new elevens had been advanced this
morning, there were two eleven-nineteens. at the midday break he
had exchanged smiles with the new one, a shy female named
harriet.

but the duplication was only for these few hours. very soon he
would not be an eleven but a twelve, and age would no longer
matter. he would be an adult, like his parents, though a new one
and untrained still.

asher was four, and sat now in the row ahead of jonas. he would
receive his assignment fourth.

fiona, eighteen, was on his left; on his other side sat twenty, a
male named pierre whom jonas didn't like much. pierre was very
serious, not much fun, and a worrier and tattletale, too. "have you
checked the rules, jonas?" pierre was always whispering solemnly.
"i'm not sure that's within the rules." usually it was some foolish



thing that no one cared about-opening his tunic if it was a day with
a bree
 
 ___________________________
 
fiona, on his left; he remembered noticing the
tenderness with which she had bathed the old. probably the one
with scientific aptitude was benjamin, the male who had devised
new, important equipment for the rehabilitation center. he heard


nothing that he recognized as himself, jonas. finally the chief
elder paid tribute to the hard work of her committee, which had
performed the observations so meticulously all year. the
committee of elders stood and was acknowledged by applause.
jonas noticed asher yawn slightly, covering his mouth politely with
his hand.

then, at last, the chief elder called number one to the stage, and
the assignments began.

each announcement was lengthy, accompanied by a speech
directed at the new twelve. jonas tried to pay attention as one,
smiling happily, received her assignment as fish hatchery
attendant along with words of praise for her childhood spent doing
many volunteer hours there, and her obvious interest in the
important process of providing nourishment f

without honor. but he thought that the committee had chosen well.
inger was a nice girl though somewhat lazy, and her body was
strong. she would enjoy the three years of being pampered that
would follow her brief training; she would give birth easily and well;
and the task of laborer that would follow would use her strength,
keep her healthy, and impose self-discipline. inger was smiling
when she resumed her seat. birthmother was an important job, if
lacking in prestige.



jonas noticed that asher looked nervous. he kept turning his head
and glancing back at jonas until the group leader had to give him a
silent chastisement, a motion to sit still and face forward.

three, isaac, was given an .assignment as instructor of sixes,
which obviously pleased him and was well deserved. now there
were three assignments gone, none of them ones that jonas would
have liked not that he could have been a birthmother, anyway, he
realized with amusement. he tried to sort through the list in his
mind, the
 
 ___________________________
 
 possible assignments that remained. but there were so
many he gave it up; and anyway, now it was asher's turn. he paid
strict attention as his friend went to the stage and stood self-
consciously beside the chief elder.



54



"all of us in the community know and enjoy asher," the chief elder
began. asher grinned and scratched one leg with the other foot.
the audience chuckled softly.

"when the committee began to consider asher's assignment," she
went on, "there were some possibilities that were immediately
discarded. some that would clearly not have been right for asher.

"for example," she said, smiling, "we did not consider for an instant
designating asher an instructor of threes."

the audience howled with laughter. asher laughed, too, looking
sheepish but pleased at the special attention. the instructors of
threes were in charge of the acquisition of correct language.

"in fact," the chief elder continued, chuckl

ing a little herself, "we
even gave a little thought to some retroactive chastisement for the
one who had been asher's instructor of threes so long ago. at the
meeting where asher was discussed, we retold many of the stories




that we all remembered from his days of language acquisition.

"especially," she said, chuckling, "the difference between snack
and smack. remember, asher?"

asher nodded ruefully, and the audience laughed aloud. jonas did,
too. he remembered, though he had been only a three at the time
himself.

the punishment used for small children was a regulated system of
smacks with the discipline wand: a thin, flexible weapon that stung
painfully when it was wielded. the childcare specialists were
trained very carefully in the discipline methods: a quick smack
across the hands for a bit of minor misbehavior; three sharper
smacks on the bare legs for a second offens

poor asher, who always talked too fast and mixed up words, even
as a toddler. as a three, eager for his juice and crackers at
snacktime, he one day said "smack" instead of "snack" as he stood
waiting in line for the morning treat.

jonas remembered it clearly. he could still see little asher, wiggling
with impatience in the line. he remembered the cheerful voice call
out, "i want my smack!"

the other threes, including jonas, had laughed nervously.
"snack!" they corrected. "you meant snack, asher!" but the mistake
had been made. and precision of language was one of the most
important tasks of small children. asher had asked for a smack.

the discipline wand, in the hand of the childcare worker, whistled
as it came down across asher's hands. asher whimpered, cringed,
and corrected h

imself instantly. "snack," he whispered.


but the next morning he had done it again. and again the following
week. he couldn't seem to stop, though for each lapse the
discipline wand came again, escalating to a series of painful lashes
that left marks on asher's legs. eventually, for a period of time,
asher stopped talking altogether, when he was a three.

"for a while," the chief elder said, relating the story, "we had a
silent asher! but he learned."

she turned to him with a smile. "when he began to talk again, it
was with greater precision. and now his lapses are very few. his
corrections and apologies are very prompt. and his good humor is
unfailing." the audience murmured in agreement. asher's cheerful
disposition was well-known throughout the community.



56



"asher." she lifted her voice to make the official announcement.
"we have given you the assignment of assistant director of
recreation."

she clipped on his n

ew badge as he stood beside her, beaming.
then he turned and left the stage as the audience cheered. when
he had taken his seat again, the chief elder looked down at him
and said the words that she had said now four times, and would
say to each new twelve. somehow she gave it special meaning for
each of them.

"asher," she said, "thank you for your childhood."

the assignments continued, and jonas watched and listened,
relieved now by the wonderful assignment his best friend had been
given. but he was more and more apprehensive as his own
approached. now the new twelves in the row ahead had all
received their badges. they were fingering them as they sat, and

jonas knew that each one was thinking about the training that lay
ahead. for some-one studious male had been selected as doctor,
a female as engineer,
 
 ___________________________
 
e did not know what
his selection meant. he did not know what he was to become.

or what would become of him.





now, for the first time in his twelve years of life, jonas felt separate,
different. he remembered what the chief elder had said: that his
training would be alone and apart.

but his training had not yet begun and already, upon leaving the
auditorium, he felt the apartness. holding the folder she had given
him, he made his way through the throng, looking for his family unit
and for asher. people moved aside for him. they watched him. he
thought he could hear whispers.

"ash!" he called, spotting his friend near the rows of bicycles. "ride
back with me?"

"sure." asher smiled, his usual smile, friendly and familiar. but
jonas felt a moment of hesitation from his friend, an uncertainty.

"congratulations," asher said.

"you too," jonas replied. "it was really funny, when she told about
the smacks. you got more applause than almost anybody else."

the other new twelves clustered n

earby, placing their folders
carefully into the carrying containers on the backs of the bikes. in
each dwelling tonight they would be

studying the instructions for the beginning of their training. each
night for years the children had memorized the required lessons for
school, often yawning with boredom. tonight they would all begin
eagerly to memorize the rules for their adult assignments.



"congratulations, asher!" someone called. then that hesitation
again. "you too, jonas!"

asher and jonas responded with congratulations to their
groupmates. jonas saw his parents watching him from the place
where their own bicycles were waiting. lily had already been
strapped into her seat.

he waved. they waved back, smiling, but he noticed that lily was
watching him solemnly, her thumb in her mouth.

he rode directly to his dwelling, exchanging only small jokes and
unimportant remarks with asher.

"see you in the morning, recreation director!" he called,
dismounting by his door as ashe

r continued on.

"right! see you!" asher called back. once again, there was just a
moment when things weren't quite the same, weren't quite as they
had always been through the long friendship. perhaps he had
imagined it. things couldn't change, with asher.

the evening meal was quieter than usual. lily chattered about her
plans for volunteer work; she would begin, she said, at the
nurturing center, since she was already an expert at feeding
gabriel.

"i know," she added quickly, when her father gave her a warning
glance, "i won't mention his name. i know i'm not supposed to know
his name.



"i can't wait for tomorrow to come," she said happily.
jonas sighed uneasily. "i can," he muttered.


"you've been greatly honored," his mother said. "your

hungry. no one in the community was starving, had ever been
starving, would ever be starving. to say "starving" was to speak a
lie. an unintentioned

lie, of course. but the reason for precision of language was to
ensure that unintentional lies were never uttered. did he
understand that? they asked him. and he had.

he had never, within his memory, been tempted to lie. asher did
not lie. lily did not lie. his parents did not lie. no one did. unless ...

now jonas had a thought that he had never had before. this new
thought was frightening. what if others-adult-- had, upon becoming
twelves, received in their instructions the same terrifying
sentence?

what if they had all been instructed: you may lie?

his mind reeled. now, empowered to ask questions of utmost
rudeness and promised answers-he could, conceivably (though it
was almost unimaginable), ask someone, some

o other things, jonas was left,
still, with a feeling of frustration that he didn't understand.

he found that he was often angry, now: irrationally angry at his
groupmates, that they were satisfied with their lives which had none
of the vibrance his own was taking on. and he was angry at
himself, that he could not change that for them.

he tried. without asking permission from the giver, because he




feared-or knew-that it would be denied, he tried to give his new
awareness to his friends.

"asher," jonas said one morning, "look at those flowers very
carefully." they were standing beside a bed of geraniums planted
near the hall of open records. he put his hands on asher's
shoulders, and concentrated on the red of the petals, trying to hold
it as long as he could, and trying at the same time to transmit the
awareness of red to his friend.

"what's the matter?" asher asked uneasily. "is something wrong?"
he moved away from jonas's hands. it was extremely rude for one
citizen to touch anoth

care of the old; and the
community was free.

jonas cheered, and put his homework folder down. he had been
about to leave for school. school was less important to him now;
and before much more time passed, his formal schooling would
end. but still, for twelves, though they had begun their adult
training, there were the endless lists of rules to be memorized and
the newest technology to be mastered.

he wished his parents, sister, and gabe a happy day, and rode
down the bicycle path, looking for asher.

he had not taken the pills, now, for four weeks. the stirrings had
returned, and he felt a little guilty and embarrassed about the
pleasurable dreams that came to him

as he slept. but he knew he couldn't go back to the world of no
feelings that he had lived in so long.

and his new, heightened feelings permeated a greater realm than
simply his sleep. though he knew that his failure to take the pills
accounted for some of it, he thought that the feelings came also
from the memories.

mories, experienced injustice and cruelty, and he had
reacted with rage that welled up so passionately inside him that the
thought of discussing it calmly at the evening meal was
unthinkable,




"i felt sad today," he had heard his mother say, and they had
comforted her.

but now jonas had experienced real sadness. he had felt grief. he
knew that there was no quick comfort for emotions like those.

these were deeper and they did not need to be told. they were
felt.

today, he felt happiness.

"asher!" he spied his friend's bicycle leaning against a tree at the
edge of the playing field. nearby, other bikes were strewn about on
the ground. on a holiday the usual rules of order could be
disregarded.

he skidded to a stop and dropped his own bike beside the others.
"hey, ash!" he shouted, looking around. there seemed to be no
one in the play area. "where are you?"

"psssheeewwww!" a child's voice, coming from behind a nearby
bush, made the sound. "pow! pow! pow!"

a female eleven named tanya

staggered forward from where she
had been hiding. dramatically she clutched her stomach and
stumbled about in a zig-zag pattern, groaning. "you got me!" she
called, and fell to the ground, grinning.

"blam!"

jonas, standing on the side of the playing field, recognized



133



asher's voice. he saw his friend, aiming an imaginary weapon in
his hand, dart from behind one tree to another. "blam! you're in my




line of ambush, jonas! watch out!"

jonas stepped back. he moved behind asher's bike and knelt so
that he was out of sight. it was a game he had often played with the
other children, a game of good guys and bad guys, a harmless
pasttime that used up their contained energy and ended only when
they all lay posed in freakish postures on the ground.

he had never recognized it before as a game of war. "attack!" the
shout came from behind the small storehouse where play
equipment was kept. three children dashed forward, their
imaginary weapons in firing position.

from the op

posite side of the field came an opposing shout:
"counter-attack!" from their hiding places a horde of children-
jonas recognized fiona in the group-emerged, running in a
crouched position, firing across the field. several of them stopped,
grabbed their own shoulders and chests with exaggerated
gestures, and pretended to be hit. they dropped to the ground and
lay suppressing giggles.

feelings surged within jonas. he found himself walking forward
into the field.

"you're hit, jonas!" asher yelled from behind the tree. "pow! you're
hit again!"

jonas stood alone in the center of the field. several of the children
raised their heads and looked at him uneasily. the attacking armies
slowed, emerged from their crouched positions, and watched to see
what he was doing.



134



in his mind, jonas saw again the face of the boy who had lain dying



on a field and had begged him for water. he had a sudden choking
feeling, as if it were difficult to breathe.

one of the children raised an
 
 ___________________________
 
 imaginary rifle and made an attempt
to destroy him with a firing noise. "pssheeew!" then they were all
silent, standing awkwardly, and the only sound was the sound of
jonas's shuddering breaths. he was struggling not to cry.

gradually, when nothing happened, nothing changed, the children
looked at each other nervously and went away. he heard the
sounds as they righted their bicycles and began to ride down the
path that led from the field. only asher and fiona remained.

"what's wrong, jonas? it was only a game," fiona said.

"you ruined it," asher said in an irritated voice.

"don't play it anymore," jonas pleaded.

"i'm the one who's training for assistant recreation director," asher
pointed out angrily. "games aren't your area of expertness."

"expertise," jonas corrected him automatically.

"whatever. you can't say what we play, even if you are going to be
the new receiver." asher looked warily at him. "i apologize for not
paying you th

e respect you deserve," he mumbled.

"asher," jonas said. he was trying to speak carefully, and with
kindness, to say exactly what he wanted to say. "you had no way of
knowing this. i didn't know it myself until recently. but it's a cruel
game. in the past, there have--"




jonas sighed. it was no use. of course asher couldn't understand.

"i accept your apology, asher," he said wearily.

"do you want to go for a ride along the river, jonas?" fiona asked,
biting her lip with nervousness.

jonas looked at her. she was so lovely. for a fleeting instant he
thought he would like nothing better than to ride peacefully along
the river path, laughing and talking with his gentle female friend.
but he knew that such times had been taken from him now. he
shook his head. after a moment his two friends turned and went to
their bikes. he watched as they rode away.

jonas

trudged to the bench beside the storehouse and sat down,
overwhelmed with feelings of loss. his childhood, his friendships,
his carefree sense of security-all of these things seemed to be
slipping away. with his new, heightened feelings, he was
overwhelmed by sadness at the way the others had laughed and
shouted, playing at war. but he knew that they could not
understand why, without the memories. he felt such love for asher
and for fiona. but they could not feel it back, without the memories.
and he could not give them those. jonas knew with certainty that
he could change nothing.

back in their dwelling, that evening, lily chattered merrily about the
wonderful holiday she had had, playing with her friends, having her
midday meal out of doors, and (she confessed) sneaking a very
short try on her father's bicycle.

"i can't wait till i get my very own bicycle next month. father's is too
big for me. i fell," she exp

become a twelve, they'll give you the assignment of storyteller! i
don't think we've had a storyteller in the community for a long time.
but if i were on the committee, i would definitely choose you for
that job!"

lily grinned. "i have a better idea for one more story," she
announced. "what if actually we were all twins and didn't know it,
and so elsewhere there would be another lily, and another jonas,
and another father, and another asher, and another chief elder,
and another--"



father groaned. "lily," he said. "it's bedtime."

"giver," jonas asked the next afternoon, "do you ever think about
release?"

"do you mean my own release, or just the general topic of
release?"

"both, i guess. i apologi— i mean i should have been more precise.
but i don't know exactly what i meant."

"sit back up. no need to lie down while we're talking." jonas, who
had already been stretched out on the bed when the question came

they would wait, with mounting anger, for him; finally they would be
forced to go, taking lily to the ceremony without him.

"they won't say anything to anyone, though," jonas said, quite
certain. "they won't call attention to my rudeness because it would
reflect on their parenting. and anyway, everyone is so involved in
the ceremony that they

probably won't notice that i'm not there. now that i'm a twelve and
in training, i don't have to sit with my age group any more. so asher
will think i'm with my parents, or with you--"

"and your parents will assume you're with asher, or with me--"

jonas shrugged. "it will take everyone a while to realize that i'm not
there at all."

"and you and i will be long on our way by then."

in the early morning, the giver would order a vehicle and driver
from the speaker. he visited the other communities frequently,
meeting with their elders; his responsibilities extended over all the
surrounding areas. so this would not be an unusual u

he did not know what
lay beyond. but there was nothing left to do but continue. he
trudged upward.

as he approached the summit of the hill at last, something began to
happen. he was not warmer; if anything, he felt more numb and
more cold. he was not less exhausted; on the contrary, his steps
were leaden, and he could barely move his freezing, tired legs.

but he began, suddenly, to feel happy. he began to recall happy
times. he remembered his parents and his sister. he remembered
his friends, asher and fiona. he remembered the giver.

memories of joy flooded through him suddenly.

he reached the place where the hill crested and he could feel the
ground under his snow-covered feet become level. it would not be
uphill anymore.

"we're almost there, gabriel," he whispered, feeling quite certain
without knowing why. "i remember this place, gabe." and it was
true. but it was not a grasping of a thin and burdensome
recollection; this was different. this was something that he could
keep. it was
