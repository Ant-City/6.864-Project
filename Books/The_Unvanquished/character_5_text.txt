supreme undefeated like two moths, two feathers riding above a hurricane. so we were
both at it; we didn't see louvinia, joby's wife and ringo's grandmother, at all. we were
facing one another at scarcely arms' length, to the other each invisible in the furious slow
jerking of the flung dust, yelling "kill the bastuds! kill them! kill them!" when her voice
seemed to descend upon us like an enormous hand, flattening the very dust which we
had raised, leaving us now visible to one another, dust-colored ourselves to the eyes and
still in the act of throwing:

stock through. but then, we never had worried about that.

we drove them in--the two mules, the cow and calf, the sow; we put up the last
panel by feel, and went back to the house. it was full dark now, even in the pasture; we
could see the lamp in the kitchen and the shadow of someone moving across the
window. when ringo and i came in, louvinia was just closing one of the big trunks from the
attic, which hadn't been down stairs since the christmas four years ago which we spent at
hawkhurst, when there wasn't any war and uncle dennison was still alive. it was a big trunk
and heavy even when empty; it had not been in the kitchen when we left to build the pen
so it had been fetched down some time during the afternoon, while joby and loosh were
in the bottom and nobody there to carry it down but granny and louvinia, and then

from carolina with father and he had been father's body servant all the time that he was
raising and training simon, ringo's father, to take over when he (joby) got too old, which
was to have been some years yet except for the war. so simon went with father; he was
still in tennessee with the army. we waited for father to begin; we waited so long that we
could tell from the sounds that louvinia was almost through in the kitchen: so that i
decided father was waiting for louvinia to finish and come in to hear too, so i said, "how
can you fight in mountains, father?"

his eyeballs. "vicksburg fell? do he mean hit fell off in the river? with ginrul pemberton in

"shhhhh!" i said. we sat close together in the shadow, listening to father. perhaps it

follow her back to the kitchen while she scolded at us over her shoulder, and when she
was inside the house we would move quietly until we were out of sight again, and then run
back to hide and watch loosh.

we followed him down to the new pen and heard him catch the mule and ride away. we
ran, but when we reached the road, too, we could only hear the mule loping, dying
away. but we had come a good piece, because even louvinia calling us sounded faint
and small. we looked up the road in the starlight, after the mule. "that's where corinth is," i
said.

he didn't get back until after dark the next day. we stayed close to the house and
watched the road by turns, to get louvinia calmed down in case it would be late before
he got back. it was late; she had followed us up to bed and we had slipped out again; we
were just passing joby's cabin when the door opened and loosh kind of surged up out of

when we looked in the window he was standing in front of the fire, with his clothes torn and
muddy where he had been hiding in swamps and bottoms from the patrollers and with
that look on his face again which resembled drunkenness but was not, as if he had not
slept in a long time and did not want to sleep now, and joby and philadelphy leaning into
the firelight and looking at him and philadelphy's mouth open too and the same look on
her face. then i saw louvinia standing in the door. we had not heard her behind us yet
there she was, with one hand on the door jamb, looking at loosh, and again she didn't
have on father's old hat.


joby said. "hush up, loosh!" "yes!" loosh said, "gin'ral sherman gonter sweep the earth and

spectacles. "they're coming here!" i said. "they're coming to set us free!" "what?" she said.

"loosh saw them! they're just down the road. it's general sherman and he's going

so i got down on the pallet with him. "we'll have to watch the road," i said. ringo
whimpered.





louvinia hollered at us, but we told her where we were and that we were making another
map, and besides, she could see the cedar copse from the kitchen. it was cool and shady
there, and quiet, and ringo slept most of the time, and i slept some too. i was dreaming--it
was like i was looking at our place and suddenly the house and stable and cabins and
trees and all were gone and i was looking at a place flat and empty as the sideboard,

ringo made a choked sound and i was looking at the road, and there in the middle of it,
sitting on a bright bay horse and looking at the house through a field glass, was a yankee.
for a long time we just lay there looking at him. i don't know what we had expected to
see, but we knew what he was at once; i remember thinking, "he looks just like a man,"
and then ringo and i were glaring at each other, and then we were crawling backward

up and shut my legs about it and slid down over the hammer until it clicked. that's what

the house didn't seem to get any nearer; it just hung there in front of us, floating and
increasing slowly in size, like something in a dream, and i could hear ringo moaning
behind me, and farther back still the shouts and the hoofs. but we reached the house at
last; louvinia was just inside the door, with father's old hat on her head rag and her mouth
open, but we didn't stop. we ran on into the room where granny was standing beside the

she had died and her voice like she had died too.

"louvinia! what is this? what are they trying to tell me?" that's how it happened--like
when once the musket decided to go off, all that was to occur afterward tried to rush into
the sound of it all at once. i could still hear it, my ears were still ringing, so that granny and

we could just hear the sound; it was louvinia that told us how he shook the musket and

"but, colonel, we saw them two kids run in here! all of us saw them!"

satisfaction, i am ashamed to say, i hope--i shall never see again. mount your men and get

we squatted there, not breathing, and heard them leave the house; we heard the
sergeant calling the men up from the barn and we heard them ride away. but we did not
move yet, because granny's body had not relaxed at all, and so we knew that the

ere, even before he spoke--the voice short, brisk, hard, with that
something of laughing behind it: "so you have no grandchildren. what a pity in a place
like this which two boys would enjoy--sports, fishing, game to shoot at, perhaps the most
exciting game of all, and none the less so for being, possibly, a little rare this near the
house. and with a gun--a very dependable weapon, i see." louvinia said how the
sergeant had set the musket in the corner and how the colonel looked at it now, and now
we didn't breathe. "though i understand that this weapon does not belong to you. which is
just as well. because if it were your weapon--which it is not--and you had two grandsons, or

and trembling, but not relaxing, yet; we could hear her panting now. and we breathed,

feel him looking at granny's spread skirt where we crouched while he thanked her for the
milk and told her his name and regiment.

"perhaps it is just as well that you have no grandchildren," he said. "since, doubtless,
you wish to live in peace. i have three boys myself, you see. and i have not even had time
to become a grandparent." and now there wasn't any laughing behind his voice, and
louvinia said he was standing there in the door, with the brass bright on his dark blue and
his hat in his hand and his bright beard and hair, looking at granny without the laughing
now: "i won't apologize; fools cry out at wind or fire. but permit me to say and hope that
you will never have anything worse than this to remember us by." then he was gone. we

joby and loosh were in the kitchen. joby was sitting behind the stove with a plate
on his knees, eating. loosh was sitting on the wood box, still, with the two shovels between
his knees, but i didn't see him at first because of ringo's shadow. the lamp was on the

that she seemed to have no feet, the twin rows of her toenails lying weightless and faint
and still as two rows of faintly soiled feathers on the floor about a foot below the hem of

loosh, who had never let his end down. "if you gonter ride on hit, pick up your feet," he
said. we carried the trunk up to granny's room, and joby was setting it down again, until
granny made him and loosh pull the bed out from the wall and slide the trunk in behind it;
ringo and i helped again. i don't believe it lacked much of weighing a thousand pounds.

granny said.

we left granny there beside her bed now well away from the wall and in such an ungainly
position that anyone would have known at once that something was concealed, even if
the trunk which ringo and i as well as joby believed now to weigh at least a thousand
pounds, could have been hidden. as it was, the bed merely underlined it. then granny
shut the door behind us and then ringo and i stopped dead in the hall and looked at one
another. since

stopped; she was already reclining on her cot and as we looked toward her she was
already in the act of drawing the quilt up over her face and head. "yawl get on to bed."

we went on to our room and began to undress. the lamp was lighted and there
was already laid out across two chairs our sunday clothes which we too would put on
tomorrow to go to memphis in. "which un you reckin she dremp about?" ringo said. but i
didn't answer that; i knew that ringo knew i didn't need to.

we put on our sunday clothes by lamplight, we ate breakfast by it and listened to louvinia
above stairs as she removed from granny's and my beds the linen we had slept under last
night and rolled up ringo's pallet and carried them downstairs; in the first beginning of day
we went out to where loosh and joby had already put the mules into the wagon and
where joby stood in what he called his sunday clothes too--the old frock coat, the napless
beaver hat of father's. when granny came out (still in the black silk and the bonnet as if
she had slept in them, passed the night standing rigid

thumps. then they came out onto the gallery.

"go and help them," granny said without looking back. "remember, joby is getting
old." we put the trunk into the wagon, along with the musket and the basket of food and
the bedclothing, and got in ourselves--granny on the seat beside joby, the bonnet on the
exact top of her head and the parasol raised even before the dew had begun to fall--and
we drove away. loosh had already disappeared, but louvinia still stood at the end of the
gallery with father's old hat on top of her head rag. then i stopped looking back, though i
could feel ringo beside me on the trunk turning every few yards, even after we were
outside the gate and in the road to town. then we came to the curve where we had seen
the yankee sergeant on the bright horse last summer.

"hit gone now," ringo said. "goodbye, sartoris; memphis, how-dy-do!"

the sun was just rising when we came in sight of jefferson; we passed a company

the porch with father's old hat on, and wishing that uncle buck would get through or hush

ringo (or even ahead of him, since i had seen the railroad when it was a railroad, which
he had not) than a boy's affinity for smoke and fury and thunder and speed. we sat there
in that slave cabin partitioned, like louvinia's cabin at home, into two rooms by that
suspended quilt beyond which aunt louisa and granny were already in bed and where
cousin denny should have been too except for the evening's dispensation he had
received, listening too who did not need to hear it again since he had been there to see it

gray darkening light.

the third letter did not come to us at all. it came to mrs. compson. drusilla and father were
home then. it was in the spring and the war was over now, and we were busy getting the
cypress and oak out of the bottom to build the house and drusilla working with joby and
ringo and father and me like another man, with her hair shorter than it had been at
hawkhurst and her face sunburned from riding in the weather and her body thin from living
like soldiers lived. after granny died ringo and louvinia and i all slept in the cabin, but
after father came ringo and louvinia moved back to the other cabin with joby and now
father and i slept on ringo's and my pallet and drusilla slept in the bed behind the quilt
curtain where granny used to sleep. and so one night i remembered aunt louisa's letter
and i showed it to drusilla and father, and father found out that drusilla had not written to
tell aunt louisa where she was and father said she must, and so one day mrs. compson
came out with the third

was gone. every now and then i could see her footprints, spaced and fast, just inside the
woods, but when i came out of the bottom, i couldn't see her. but the surreys and buggies
were still in front of the cabin and i could see mrs. compson and the other ladies on the
porch, looking out across the pasture toward the bottom, so i did not go there. but before i
came to the other cabin, where louvinia and joby and ringo lived, i saw louvinia come
up the hill from the spring, carrying her cedar water bucket and singing. then she went into
the cabin and the singing stopped short off and so i knew where drusilla was. but i didn't
hide. i went to the window and looked in and saw drusilla just turning from where she had
been leaning her head in her arms on the mantel when louvinia came in with the water
bucket and a gum twig in her mouth and father's old hat on top of her head rag. drusilla

back and lay flat on the belly of drusilla's overalls, then louvinia was holding drusilla in her
arms like she used to hold me and drusilla was crying hard. "that john and i--that we--and

long either. they set the box on the sawchunk where louvinia washed, and ringo got the
pokeberry juice and an old piece of window shade, and they cut it into ballots. "let all
who want the honorable cassius q. benbow to be marshal of jefferson write yes on his
ballot; opposed, no," father said.
"and i'll do the writing and save some more time," george wyatt said. so he made

the unsentient bell quality gone now, her voice whispering into that quiet death-filled room
with a passionate and dying fall: "bayard." she faced me, she was quite near; again the
scent of the verbena in her hair seemed to have increased a hundred times as she stood
holding out to me, one in either hand, the two duelling pistols. "take them, bayard," she
said, in the same tone in which she had said "kiss me" last summer, already pressing them

to the heart without bothering the laggard brain at all. she stood erect now, staring at me
with intolerable and amazed incredulity which occupied her face alone for a whole
minute while her eyes were completely empty; it seemed to me that i stood there for a full
minute while aunt jenny and louvinia watched us, waiting for her eyes to fill. there was no
blood in her face at all, her mouth open a little and pale as one of those rubber rings
women seal fruit jars with. then her eyes filled with an expression of bitter and passionate
betrayal. "why, he's not--" she said. "he's not--and i kissed his hand," she said in an aghast
whisper; "i kissed his hand!" beginning to laugh, the laughter, rising, becoming a scream yet
still remaining laughter, screaming with laughter, trying herself to deade

rising again, becoming the scream again yet still remaining laughter, she still trying to hold
it back with her hand like a small child who has filled its mouth too full.

"take her upstairs," aunt jenny said. but they were already moving toward the door,
louvinia half-carrying drusilla, the laughter diminishing as they neared the door as though
it waited for the larger space of the empty and brilliant hall to rise again. then it w

 but now it was the day song, no longer the drowsy moony fluting.
then they all began--the sparrows from the stable, the thrush that lived in aunt jenny's
garden, and i heard a quail too from the pasture and now there was light in the room. but i
didn't move at once. i still lay on the bed (i hadn't undressed) with my hands under my
head and the scent of drusilla's verbena faint from where my coat lay on a chair,
watching the light grow, watching it turn rosy with the sun. after a while i heard louvinia
come up across the back yard and go into the kitchen; i heard the door and then the
long crash of her armful of stovewood into the box. soon they would begin to arrive--the
carriages and buggies in the drive--but not for a while yet because they too would wait
first to see what i was going to do. so the house was quiet when i went down to the
diningroom, no sound in it except simon snoring in the parlor, probably still sitting on the
stool though i didn't look in to see. instead i stood at the

the coffee which louvinia brought me, then i went to the stable; i saw joby watching me
from the kitchen door as i crossed the yard and in the stable loosh looked up at me across
betsy's head, a curry comb in his hand, though ringo didn't look at me at all. we curried
jupiter then. i didn't know if we would be able to without trouble or not, since always
father would come in first and touch him and tell him to stand and he would stand like a
marble horse (or pale bronze rather) while loosh curried him. but he stood for

seemed to come not from her
mouth but to burst out all over her face like sweat does and with a dreadful and painful
convulsion as when you have vomited until it hurts you yet still you must vomit again--burst
out all over her face except her eyes, the brilliant incredulous eyes looking at me out of the
laughter as if they belonged to somebody else, as if they were two inert fragments of tar or
coal lying on the bottom of a receptacle filled with turmoil: "i kissed his hand! i kissed his
hand!" louvinia entered, aunt jenny must have sent her directly after me; again i walked
slowly and steadily so it would not start yet, down the stairs where aunt jenny stood
beneath the chandelier in the hall as mrs. wilkins had stood yesterday at the university. she
had my hat in her hand. "even if you hid all day in the stable, bayard," she said. i took the
hat; she said quietly, pleasantly, as if she were talking to a stranger, a guest: "i used to see
a lot of blockade runners in charleston. they were hero

watched them come up as though she were trying to stop them; i felt them on my
shoulders as if they had a separate life of their own and were trying to do something which
for my sake she was trying to restrain, prevent. then she gave up or she was not strong
enough because they came up and took my face between them, hard, and suddenly the
tears sprang and streamed down her face like drusilla's laughing had. "oh, damn you
sartorises!" she said. "damn you! damn you!"

louvinia laying the table for supper. so the stairs were lighted quite well. but the upper hall
was dark. i saw her open door (that unmistakable way in which an open door stands open
when nobody lives in the room any more) and i realised i had not believed that she was
really gone. so i didn't look into the room. i went on to mine and entered. and then for a
long moment i thought it was the verbena in my lapel which i still smelled. i thought that
