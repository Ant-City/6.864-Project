s, i will conceal her for a time. but first you must solemnly promise that my name shall never be mentioned. if such a thing should become known, it would ruin me and my family. no one in my house must know of it, except the cook. she is so faithful that i would trust my own life with her; and i know she likes linda. it is a great risk; but i trust no harm will come of it. get word to linda to be ready as soon as it is dark, before the patrols are out. i will send the housemaids on errands, and betty shall go to meet linda." the place where we were to meet was designated and agreed upon. my grandmother was unable to thank the lady for this noble deed; overcome by her emotions, she sank on her knees and sobbed like a child.

        i received a message to leave my friend's house at such an hour, and go to a certain place where a friend would be waiting for me. as a matter of prudence no names were mentioned. i had no means of conjecturing

 did not like to move thus blindfolded, but i had no choice. it would not do for me to remain where i was. i disguised myself, summoned up courage to meet the worst, and went to the appointed place. my friend betty was there; she was the last person i expected to see. we hurried along in silence. the pain in my leg was so intense that it seemed as if i should drop; but fear gave me strength. we reached the house and entered unobserved. her first words were: "honey, now you is safe. dem devils ain't coming to search dis house. when i get you into missis' safe place, i will bring some nice hot supper. i specs you need it after all dis skeering." betty's vocation led her to think eating the most important th

ing in life. she did not realize that my heart was too full for me to care much about supper.

        the mistress came to meet us, and led me up stairs to a small room over her own sleeping apartment. "you will be safe here, linda," said she; "i keep this room to store away things that are out of use. the girls are not accustomed to be sent to it, and they will not suspect anything unless they hear some noise. i always keep it locked, and betty shall take care of the key. but you must be very careful, for my sake as well as your own; and you must never tell my secret; for it would ruin me and my family. i will keep the girls busy in the morning, that betty may have a chance to bring your breakfast; but it will not do for her to come to you again till night. i will come to see you sometimes. keep up your courage. i hope this state of things will not last long." betty came with the

        poor william! he also must suffer for being my brother. i took his advice and kept quiet. my aunt was taken out of jail at the end of a month, because mrs. flint could not spare her any longer. she was tired of being her own housekeeper. it was quite too fatiguing to order her dinner and eat it too. my children remained in jail, where brother william did all he could for their comfort. betty went to see them sometimes, and brought me tidings. she was not permitted to enter the jail; but william would hold them up to the grated window while she chatted with them. when she repeated their prattle, and told me how they

wanted to see their ma, my tears would flow. old betty would exclaim, "lors, chile! what's you crying 'bout? dem young uns vil kill you dead. don't be so chick'n hearted! if you does, you vil nebber git thro' dis world."

ough the world childless. she had never had little ones to clasp their arms round her neck; she had never seen their soft eyes looking into hers; no sweet little voices had called her mother; she had never pressed her own infants to her heart, with the feeling that even in fetters there was something to live for. how could she realize my feelings? betty's husband loved children dearly, and wondered why god had denied them to him. he expressed great sorrow when he came to betty with the tidings that ellen had been taken out of jail and carried to dr. flint's. she had the measles a short time before they carried her to jail, and the disease had left her eyes affected. the doctor had taken her home to attend to them. my children had always been afraid of the doctor and his wife. they had never been inside of their house. poor little ellen cried all day to be carried back to prison. the instincts of childhood are true. she knew she was loved in the jail. her screams and

"i saw your light, and i thought i would just stop and tell you that i have found out where linda is. i know where to put my hands on her, and i shall have her before twelve o'clock." when he had turned away, my grandmother and my uncle looked anxiously at each other. they did not know whether or not it was merely one of the doctor's tricks to frighten them. in their uncertainty, they thought it was best to have a

message conveyed to my friend betty. unwilling to alarm her mistress, betty resolved to dispose of me herself. she came to me, and told me to rise and dress quickly. we hurried down stairs, and across the yard, into the kitchen. she locked the door, and lifted up a plank in the floor. a buffalo skin and a bit of carpet were spread for me to lie on, and a quilt thrown over me. "stay dar," said she, "till i sees if dey know 'bout you. dey say dey vil put thar hans on you afore twelve o'clock. if dey did know whar you are, dey won't

        some days after this adventure i had a much worse

page 159
fright. as i sat very still in my retreat above stairs, cheerful visions floated through my mind. i thought dr. flint would soon get discouraged, and would be willing to sell my children, when he lost all hopes of making them the means of my discovery. i knew who was ready to buy them. su

t seem like music, but like the moaning of children. it seemed as if my heart would burst. i rose from my sitting posture, and knelt. a streak of moonlight was on the floor before me, and in the midst of it appeared the forms of my two children. they vanished; but i had seen them distinctly. some will call it a dream, others a vision. i know not how to account for it, but it made a strong impression on my mind, and i felt certain something had happened to my little ones.

        i had not seen betty since morning. now i heard her softly turning the key. as soon as she entered, i clung to her, and begged her to let me know whether my children were dead, or whether they were sold; for i had seen their spirits in my room, and i was sure something had happened to them. "lor, chile," said she, putting her arms round me, "you's got de highsterics. i'll sleep wid you to-night, 'cause you'll make a noise, and ruin missis. something has stirred you up mightily. when you is done cryin, i'll talk wid

vill hear you." i tried to obey her. she lay down and was soon sound asleep; but no sleep would come to my eyelids.

        at dawn, betty was up and off to the kitchen. the hours passed on, and the vision of the night kept constantly recurring to my thought. after a while i heard the voices of two women in the entry. in one of them i recognized the housemaid. the other said to her, "did you know linda brent's children was sold to the speculator yesterday. they say ole massa flint was mighty glad to see 'em drove out of town; but they say they've come back agin. i 'spect it's all their daddy's doings. they say he's bought william

too. lor! how it will take hold of ole massa flint! i'm going roun' to aunt marthy's to see 'bout it."

        i bit my lips till the blood came to keep from crying out. were my children with their grandmother, or had the speculator carried them off? the suspense was dreadful. would betty never come, and tell me the truth about it? at last she came, and i eagerly repeated what i had overheard. her face was one broad bright smile. "lor, you foolish ting!" said she. "i'se gwine to tell you all bout it. de gals is eating thar breakfast, and missus tole me to let her tell you; but, poor creeter! t'aint right to keep you waitin', and i'se gwine to tell you. brudder, chillern, all is bought by de daddy! i'se laugh more dan nuff, tinking 'bout ole massa flint. lor, how he vill swar! he

        betty went off laughing; and i said to myself, "can it be true that my children are free? i have not suffered for them in vain. thank god!"

        great surprise was expressed when it was known that my children had returned to their grandmother's. the news spread through town, and many a kind word was bestowed on the little ones.

        dr. flint went to my grandmother's to ascertain who was the owner of my children, and she informed him. "i expected as much," said he. "i am glad to hear

fore a court, and swore truly that he knew nothing of my intention to escape, and that he had not seen me since i left my master's plantation. the doctor then demanded that he should give bail for five hundred dollars that he would have nothing to do with me. several gentlemen offered to be security for him; but mr. sands told him he had better go back to jail, and he would see that he came out without giving bail.
        the news of his arrest was carried to my grandmother, who conveyed it to betty. in the kindness of her heart, she again stowed me away under the floor; and as she walked back and forth, in the performance of her culinary duties, she talked apparently to herself, but with the intention that i should hear what was going on. i hoped that my uncle's imprisonment would last but few days; still i was anxious. i thought it likely that dr. flint would do his utmost to taunt and insult him, and i was afraid my uncle might lose control of himself, and retort in some way that would

page 168
was renewed. something had excited suspicions that i was in the vicinity. they searched the house i was in. i heard their steps and their voices. at night, when all were asleep, betty came to release me from my place of confinement. the fright i had undergone, the constrained posture, and the dampness of the ground, made me ill for several days. my uncle was soon after taken out of prison; but the movements of all my relatives, and of all our friends, were very closely watched.

        we all saw that i could not remain where i was much longer. i had already staid longer than was intended, and i knew my presence must be a source of perpetual anxiety to my kind benefactress.

 during this time, my friends had laid many plans for my escape, but the extreme vigilance of my persecutors made it impossible to carry them into effect.

        one morning i was much startled by hearing somebody trying to get into my room. several keys were tried, but none fitted. i instantly conjectured it was one of the housemaids; and i concluded she must either have heard some noise in the room, or have noticed the entrance of betty. when my friend came, at her usual time, i told her what had happened. "i knows who it was," said she. "'pend upon it, 'twas dat jenny. dat nigger allers got de debble in her." i suggested that she might have seen or heard something that excited her curiosity.

        "tut! tut! chile!" exclaimed betty, "she ain't seen notin', nor hearn notin'. she only 'spects something. dat's all. she wants to fine out who hab cut and make my gownd. but she won't nebber know. dat's sartin. i'll git missis to

page 169
        i reflected a moment, and said, "betty, i must leave here to-night."

        "do as you tink best, poor chile," she replied. "i'se mighty 'fraid dat 'ere nigger vill pop on you some time."

        she reported the incident to her mistress, and received orders to keep jenny busy in the kitchen till she could see my uncle phillip. he told her he would send a friend for me that very evening. she told him she hoped i was going to the north, for it was very dangerous for me to remain any where in the vicinity. alas, it was not an easy

thing, for one in my situation, to go to the north. in order to leave the coast quite clear for me, she went into the country to spend the day with her brother, and took jenny with her. she was afraid to come and bid me good by, but she left a kind message with betty. i heard her carriage roll from the door, and i never again saw her who had so generously befriended the poor, trembling fugitive! though she was a slaveholder, to this day my heart blesses her!

        i had not the slightest idea where i was going. betty brought me a suit of sailor's clothes,—jacket, trousers, and tarpaulin hat. she gave me a small bundle, saying i might need it where i was going. in cheery tones, she exclaimed, "i'se so glad you is gwine to free parts! don't forget ole be

you to de lower gate. put your hands in your pockets, and walk ricketty, like de sailors."

        i performed to her satisfaction. at the gate i found peter, a young colored man, waiting for me. i had known him for years. he had been an apprentice to my father, and had always borne a good character. i was not afraid to trust to him. betty bade me a hurried good by, and we walked off. "take courage, linda," said my friend peter. "i've got a dagger, and no man shall take you from me, unless he passes over my dead body."

        it was a long time since i had taken a walk out of doors, and the fresh air revived me. it was also pleasant to hear a human voice speaking to me above a whisper. i passed several people whom i knew, but they did not recognize me in my disguise. i prayed internally that, for peter's sake, as well as my own
