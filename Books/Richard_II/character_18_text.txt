 day

   fitz. now by my soule, i would it were this houre

   aum. fitzwater thou art damn'd to hell for this

   per. aumerle, thou lye'st: his honor is as true
in this appeale, as thou art all vniust:
and that thou art so, there i throw my gage
to proue it on thee, to th' extreamest point
of mortall breathing. seize it, if thou dar'st

   aum. and if i do not, may my hands rot off,
and neuer brandish more reuengefull steele,
ouer the glittering helmet of my foe

   surrey. my lord fitzwater:
i do remember well, the very time
aumerle, and you did talke

   fitz. my lord,
'tis very true: you were in presence then,
and you can witnesse with me, this is true

   surrey. as false, by heauen,
as heauen it selfe is true

   fitz. surrey, thou lyest

   surrey. dishonourable boy;
that lye, shall lie so heauy on my sword,
that it shall render vengeance, and reuenge,
till thou the lye-giuer, and that lye, doe lye
in earth as quiet, as thy fathers scull.
in proofe whereof,
