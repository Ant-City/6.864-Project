r reason?â€ said prince john, who, for some cause
which perhaps he could not himself have explained, felt a painful
curiosity respecting this individual.

â€œbecause,â€ replied the woodsman, â€œi know not if these yeomen and i are
used to shoot at the same marks; and because, moreover, i know not how
your grace might relish the winning of a third prize by one who has
unwittingly fallen under your displeasure.â€

prince john coloured as he put the question, â€œwhat is thy name, yeoman?â€

â€œlocksley,â€ answered the yeoman.

â€œthen, locksley,â€ said prince john, â€œthou shalt shoot in thy turn, when
these yeomen have displayed their skill. if thou carriest the prize,
i will add to it twenty nobles; but if thou losest it, thou shalt
be stript of thy lincoln green, and scourged out of the lists with
bowstrings, for a wordy and insolent braggart.â€

â€œand how if i refuse to shoot on such a wager?â€ said the yeoman.--â€œyour
graceâ€™s power, supported, as it is, by so many men-at-arms, ma

one by one the archers, stepping forward, delivered their shafts
yeomanlike and bravely. of twenty-four arrows, shot in succession,
ten were fixed in the target, and the others ranged so near it, that,
considering the distance of the mark, it was accounted good archery. of
the ten shafts which hit the target, two within the inner ring were shot
by hubert, a forester in the service of malvoisin, who was accordingly
pronounced victorious.

â€œnow, locksley,â€ said prince john to the bold yeoman, with a bitter
smile, â€œwilt thou try conclusions with hubert, or wilt thou yield up
bow, baldric, and quiver, to the provost of the sports?â€

â€œsith it be no better,â€ said locksley, â€œi am content to try my fortune;
on condition that when i have shot two shafts at yonder mark of
hubertâ€™s, he shall be bound to shoot one at that which i shall propose.â€

â€œthat is but fair,â€ answered prince john, â€œand it shall not be refused
thee.--if thou d

ength he made a
step forward, and raising the bow at the full stretch of his left arm,
till the centre or grasping-place was nigh level with his face, he
drew his bowstring to his ear. the arrow whistled through the air, and
lighted within the inner ring of the target, but not exactly in the
centre.

â€œyou have not allowed for the wind, hubert,â€ said his antagonist,
bending his bow, â€œor that had been a better shot.â€

so saying, and without showing the least anxiety to pause upon his
aim, locksley stept to the appointed station, and shot his arrow as
carelessly in appearance as if he had not even looked at the mark. he
was speaking almost at the instant that the shaft left the bowstring,
yet it alighted in the target two inches nearer to the white spot which
marked the centre than that of hubert.

â€œby the light of heaven!â€ said prince john to hubert, â€œan thou suffer
that runagate knave to overcome thee, thou art worthy of the gallows!â€

hubert had but one set speech for all occas

 the worse for
thee!â€

thus exhorted, hubert resumed his place, and not neglecting the
caution which he had received from his adversary, he made the necessary
allowance for a very light air of wind, which had just arisen, and
shot so successfully that his arrow alighted in the very centre of the
target.

â€œa hubert! a hubert!â€ shouted the populace, more interested in a known
person than in a stranger. â€œin the clout!--in the clout!--a hubert for
ever!â€

â€œthou canst not mend that shot, locksley,â€ said the prince, with an
insulting smile.

â€œi will notch his shaft for him, however,â€ replied locksley.

and letting fly his arrow with a little more precaution than before, it
lighted right upon that of his competitor, which it split to shivers.
the people who stood around were so astonished at his wonderful
dexterity, that they could not even give vent to their surprise in their
usual clamour. â€œthis must be the devil, and no man of flesh and blood,â€
 whispered the yeomen to each o

ther; â€œsuch archery was never seen since a
bow was first bent in britain.â€

â€œand now,â€ said locksley, â€œi will crave your graceâ€™s permission to plant
such a mark as is used in the north country; and welcome every brave
yeoman who shall try a shot at it to win a smile from the bonny lass he
loves best.â€

he then turned to leave the lists. â€œlet your guards attend me,â€ he said,
â€œif you please--i go but to cut a rod from the next willow-bush.â€

prince john made a signal that some attendants should follow him in
case of his escape: but the cry of â€œshame! shame!â€ which burst from th

multitude, induced him to alter his ungenerous purpose.

locksley returned almost instantly with a willow wand about six feet in
length, perfectly straight, and rather thicker than a manâ€™s thumb. he
began to peel this with great composure, observing at the same time,
that to ask a good woodsman to shoot at a target so broad as had
hitherto been used, was to put shame upon his skill. â€œfor his own part,â€
 he said, â€œand in the land where he was bred, men would as soon take for
their mark king arthurâ€™s round-table, which held sixty knights around
it. a

of hastings,
and never shot at such a mark in his life--and neither will i. if this
yeoman can cleave that rod, i give him the bucklers--or rather, i yield
to the devil that is in his jerkin, and not to any human skill; a man
can but do his best, and i will not shoot where i am sure to miss. i
might as well shoot at the edge of our parsonâ€™s whittle, or at a wheat
straw, or at a sunbeam, as at a twinkling white streak which i can
hardly see.â€

â€œcowardly dog!â€ said prince john.--â€œsirrah locksley, do thou shoot; but,
if thou hittest such a mark, i will say thou art the first man ever
did so. however it be, thou shalt not crow over us with a mere show of
superior skill.â€

â€œi will do my best, as hubert says,â€ answered locksley; â€œno man can do
more.â€

so saying, he again bent his bow, but on the present occasion looked
with attention to his weapon, and changed the string, which he thought
was no longer truly round, having been a little frayed by the two former
shots. he then took

 his aim with some deliberation, and the multitude
awaited the event in breathless silence. the archer vindicated their
opinion of his skill: his arrow split the willow rod against which it
was aimed. a jubilee of acclamations followed; and even prince john, in
admiration of locksleyâ€™s skill, lost for an instant his dislike to his
person. â€œthese twenty nobles,â€ he said, â€œwhich, with the bugle, thou
hast fairly won, are thine own; we will make them fifty, if thou wilt
take livery and service with us as a yeoman of our body guard, and be
near to our person. for never did so strong a hand bend a bow, or so
true an eye direct a shaft.â€

â€œpardon me, noble prince,â€ said locksley; â€œbut i have vowed, that if
ever i take service, it should be with your royal brother

king richard.
these twenty nobles i leave to hubert, who has this day drawn as brave
a bow as his grandsire did at hastings. had his modesty not refused the
trial, he would have hit the wand as well i.â€

hubert shook his head as he received with reluctance the bounty of the
stranger, and locksley, anxious to escape further observation, mixed
with the crowd, and was seen no more.

the victorious archer would not perhaps have escaped johnâ€™s attention
so easily, had not that prince had other subjects of anxious and more
important meditation pressing upon his mind at that instant. he called
upon his chamberlain as he gave the signal for retiring from the lists,
and commanded him instantly to gallop to ashby, and seek out isaac the

as the jester was about to obey, a third person suddenly made his
appearance, and commanded them both to halt. from his dress and arms,
wamba would have conjectured him to be one of those outlaws who had just
assailed his master; but, besides that he wore no mask, the glittering
baldric across his shoulder, with the rich bugle-horn which it
supported, as well as the calm and commanding expression of his voice
and manner, made him, notwithstanding the twilight, recognise locksley
the yeoman, who had been victorious, under such disadvantageous
circumstances, in the contest for the prize of archery.

â€œwhat is the meaning of all this,â€ said he, â€œor who is it that rifle,
and ransom, and make prisoners, in these forests?â€

â€œyou may look at their cassocks close by,â€ said wamba, â€œand see whether
they be thy childrenâ€™s coats or no--for they are as like thine own, as

â€œwhat devilâ€™s matins are you after at this hour?â€ said a voice from
without.

and perhaps his nocturnal potations, prevented from recognising accents
which were tolerably familiar to him--â€œwend on your way, in the name of
god and saint dunstan, and disturb not the devotions of me and my holy

â€œbut who is he?â€ said the black knight; â€œit imports me much to know.â€

â€œwho is he?â€ answered the hermit; â€œi tell thee he is a friend.â€

â€œbut what friend?â€ answered the knight; â€œfor he may be friend to thee
and none of mine?â€

â€œwhat friend?â€ replied the hermit; â€œthat, now, is one of the questions
that is more easily asked than answered. what friend?--why, he is, now

â€œay, as honest a keeper as thou art a pious hermit,â€ replied the knight,
â€œi doubt it not. but undo the door to him before he beat it from its

the dogs, in the meantime, which had made a dreadful baying at the
commencement of the disturbance, seemed now to recognise the voice
of him who stood without; for, totally changing their manner, they
scratched and whined at the door, as if interceding for his admission.
the hermit speedily unbolted his portal, and admitted locksley, with his
two companions.

â€œwhy, hermit,â€ was the yeomanâ€™s first question as soon as he beheld the
knight, â€œwhat boon companion hast thou here?â€

â€œa brother of our order,â€ replied the friar, shaking his head; â€œwe have
been at our orisons all night.â€

â€œhe is a monk of the church militant, i think,â€ answered locksley; â€œand

aside, â€œart thou mad? to give admittance to a knight thou dost not know?

â€œnot know him!â€ replied the friar, boldly, â€œi know him as well as the
beggar knows his dish.â€

â€œand what is his name, then?â€ demanded locksley.

â€œhis name,â€ said the hermit--â€œhis name is sir anthony of
scrabelstone--as if i would drink with a man, and did not know his
name!â€

â€œthou hast been drinking more than enough, friar,â€ said the woodsman,
â€œand, i fear, prating more than enough too.â€

â€œgood yeoman,â€ said the knight, coming forward, â€œbe not wroth with my
merry host. he did but afford me the hospitality which i would have
compelled from him if he had refused it.â€

œnever fear,â€ said the hermit; â€œi will but confess the sins of my green

â€œamen!â€ answered the jester; â€œa broadcloth penitent should have a
sackcloth confessor, and your frock may absolve my motley doublet into
the bargain.â€

so saying, he accommodated the friar with his assistance in tying the
endless number of points, as the laces which attached the hose to the
doublet were then termed.

while they were thus employed, locksley led the knight a little apart,
and addressed him thus:--â€œdeny it not, sir knight--you are he who
decided the victory to the advantage of the english against the
strangers on the second day of the tournament at ashby.â€

â€œand what follows if you guess truly, good yeoman?â€ replied the knight.

â€œi should in that case hold you,â€ replied the yeoman, â€œa friend to the
weaker party.â€

â€œsuch is the duty of a true knight at least,â€ replied the black
champion; â€œand i would not willing

â€œso,â€ said wamba to gurth,--for the friar being now fully equipped, the
jester, having approached to the other side of the hut, had heard the
conclusion of the conversation,--â€œso we have got a new ally?--l trust
the valour of the knight will be truer metal than the religion of the
hermit, or the honesty of the yeoman; for this locksley looks like a
born deer-stealer, and the priest like a lusty hypocrite.â€

â€œhold thy peace, wamba,â€ said gurth; â€œit may all be as thou dost guess;
but were the horned devil to rise and proffer me his assistance to
set at liberty cedric and the lady rowena, i fear i should hardly have
religion enough to refuse the foul fiendâ€™s offer, and bid him get behind
me.â€

the friar was now completely accoutred as a yeoman, with sword and
buckler, bow, and quiver, and a strong partisan over his s

left his cell at the head of the party, and, having carefully locked the
door, deposited the key under the threshold.

â€œart thou in condition to do good service, friar,â€ said locksley, â€œor
does the brown bowl still run in thy head?â€

â€œnot more than a drought of st dunstanâ€™s fountain will allay,â€ answered
the priest; â€œsomething there is of a whizzing in my brain, and of
instability in my legs, but you shall presently see both pass away.â€

so saying, he stepped to the stone basin, in which the waters of
the fountain as they fell formed bubbles which danced in the white
moonlight, and took so long a drought as if he had meant to exhaust the
spring.

and the dragon, i am no longer a shaveling than while my frock is on my
back--when i am cased in my green cassock, i will drink, swear, and woo
a lass, with any blithe forester in the west riding.â€

as a whole convent on a holy eve, when the father abbot has gone to
bed.--come on you, too, my masters, tarry not to talk of it--i say, come
on, we must collect all our forces, and few enough we shall have, if we
are to storm the castle of reginald front-de-boeuf.â€

â€œwhat! is it front-de-boeuf,â€ said the black knight, â€œwho has stopt on
the kingâ€™s highway the kingâ€™s liege subjects?--is he turned thief and
oppressor?â€

â€œoppressor he ever was,â€

â€œand for thief,â€ said the priest, â€œi doubt if ever he were even half so

unsaid, both in decency and prudence.â€

at the bottom of this document was scrawled, in the first place, a
rude sketch of a cockâ€™s head and comb, with a legend expressing this
hieroglyphic to be the sign-manual of wamba, son of witless. under this
respectable emblem stood a cross, stated to be the mark of gurth, the
son of beowulph. then was written, in rough bold characters, the words,
â€œle noir faineantâ€. and, to conclude the whole, an arrow, neatly enough
drawn, was described as the mark of the yeoman locksley.

the knights heard this uncommon document read from end to end, and then
gazed upon each other in silent amazement, as being utterly at a loss to
know what it could portend. de bracy was the first to break silence by
an uncontrollable fit of laughter, wherein he was joined, though with
more moderation, by the templar. front-de-boeuf, on the contrary, seemed
impatient of their ill-timed jocularity.

this letter being folded, was delivered to the squire, and by him to
the messenger who waited without, as the answer to that which he had
brought.

the yeoman having thus accomplished his mission, returned to the
head-quarters of the allies, which were for the present established
under a venerable oak-tree, about three arrow-flights distant from the
castle. here wamba and gurth, with their allies the black knight and
locksley, and the jovial hermit, awaited with impatience an answer to
their summons. around, and at a distance from them, were seen many a
bold yeoman, whose silvan dress and weatherbeaten countenances showed
the ordinary nature of their occupation. more than two hundred had
already assembled, and others were fast coming in. those whom they
obeyed as leaders were only distinguished from the others by a feather
in the cap, their dress, arms, and equipments being in all other
respects the same.

he then gave the letter to gurth, who shook his head gruffly, and passed
it to wamba. the jester looked at each of the four corners of the paper
with such a grin of affected intelligence as a monkey is apt to assume
upon similar occasions, then cut a caper, and gave the letter to
locksley.

â€œif the long letters were bows, and the short letters broad arrows, i
might know something of the matter,â€ said the brave yeoman; â€œbut as the
matter stands, the meaning is as safe, for me, as the stag thatâ€™s at

â€œi must be clerk, then,â€ said the black knight; and taking the letter
from locksley, he first read it over to himself, and then explained the
meaning in saxon to his confederates.

â€œwe have nothing else to tear it with,â€ replied wamba; â€œbut mine are
scarce fit to make mammocks of freestone and mortar.â€

â€œâ€˜tis but a contrivance to gain time,â€ said locksley; â€œthey dare not do
a deed for which i could exact a fearful penalty.â€

â€œi would,â€ said the black knight, â€œthere were some one among us who
could obtain admission into the castle, and discover how the case stands
with the besieged. methinks, as they require a confessor to be sent,
this holy hermit might at once exercise his pious vocation, and procure
us the information we desire.â€

assure these tyrants, that whatever violence they exercise on the
persons of their prisoners, shall be most severely repaid upon their
own.â€

cedric, although not greatly confident in ulricaâ€™s message, omitted not
to communicate her promise to the black knight and locksley. they were
well pleased to find they had a friend within the place, who might, in
the moment of need, be able to facilitate their entrance, and readily
agreed with the saxon that a storm, under whatever disadvantages, ought
to be attempted, as the only means of liberating the prisoners now in
the hands of the cruel front-de-boeuf.

â€œthe royal blood of alfred is endangered,â€ said cedric.

heavy halberd to play around his head as a shepherd boy flourishes his
light crook.

â€œtrue, holy clerk,â€ said the black knight, â€œtrue as if saint dunstan
himself had said it.--and now, good locksley, were it not well that
noble cedric should assume the direction of this assault?â€

â€œnot a jot i,â€ returned cedric; â€œi have never been wont to study either
how to take or how to hold out those abodes of tyrannic power, which
the normans have erected in this groaning land. i will fight among the
foremost; but my honest neighbours well know i am not a trained soldier
in the discipline of wars, or the attack of strongholds.â€

the parts being thus distributed to the leaders, they commenced the
first assault, of which the reader has already heard the issue.

when the barbican was carried, the sable knight sent notice of the
happy event to locksley, requesting him at the same time, to keep such
a strict observation on the castle as might prevent the defenders from
combining their force for a sudden sally, and recovering the outwork
which they had lost. this the knight was chiefly desirous of avoiding,
conscious that the men whom he led, being hasty and untrained
volunteers, imperfectly armed and unaccustomed to discipline, must, upon
any sudden attack, fight at great disadvantage with the veteran soldiers

when the raft was completed, the black knight addressed the
besiegers:--â€œit avails not waiting here longer, my friends; the sun is

permit me to tarry with you another day. besides, it will be a marvel if

discharge of arrows on the opposite side of the castle, and move forward
as if about to assault it; and you, true english hearts, stand by me,
and be ready to thrust the raft endlong over the moat whenever the
postern on our side is thrown open. follow me boldly across, and aid me
to burst yon sallyport in the main wall of the castle. as many of you as
like not this service, or are but ill armed to meet it, do you man the

that projected from the parapet.

at this moment the besiegers caught sight of the red flag upon the angle
of the tower which ulrica had described to cedric. the stout yeoman
locksley was the first who was aware of it, as he was hasting to the
outwork, impatient to see the progress of the assault.

â€œsaint george!â€ he cried, â€œmerry saint george for england!--to the
charge, bold yeomen!--why leave ye the good knight and noble cedric to
storm the pass alone?--make in, mad priest, show thou canst fight for
thy rosary,--make in, brave yeomen!--the castle is ours, we have friends

and, snatching it up, he again assailed the loosened pinnacle, which was
of weight enough, if thrown down, not only to have destroyed the remnant
of the drawbridge, which sheltered the two foremost assailants, but also
to have sunk the rude float of planks over which they had crossed. all
saw the danger, and the boldest, even the stout friar himself, avoided
setting foot on the raft. thrice did locksley bend his shaft against de
bracy, and thrice did his arrow bound back from the knightâ€™s armour of
proof.

â€œcurse on thy spanish steel-coat!â€ said locksley, â€œhad english smith
forged it, these arrows had gone through, an as if it had been silk or
sendal.â€ he then began to call out, â€œcomrades! friends! noble cedric!

his warning voice was unheard, for the din which the knight himself
occasioned by his strokes upon the postern would have drowned twen

they saw the postern open, and drove
back the dispirited and despairing followers of de bracy, of whom some
asked quarter, some offered vain resistance, and the greater part fled
towards the court-yard. de bracy himself arose from the ground, and cast
a sorrowful glance after his conqueror. â€œhe trusts me not!â€ he repeated;
â€œbut have i deserved his trust?â€ he then lifted his sword from the
floor, took off his helmet in token of submission, and, going to the
barbican, gave up his sword to locksley, whom he met by the way.

as the fire augmented, symptoms of it became soon apparent in the
chamber, where ivanhoe was watched and tended by the jewess rebecca. he
had been awakened from his brief slumber by the noise of the battle; and
his attendant, who had, at his anxious desire, again placed herself at
the window to watch and report to him the fate of the attack, was
for some time prevented from observing either, by the increase of the
smouldering and stifling vapour. at length the volumes

iac figure of the saxon ulrica was
for a long time visible on the lofty stand she had chosen, tossing
her arms abroad with wild exultation, as if she reined empress of the
conflagration which she had raised. at length, with a terrific crash,
the whole turret gave way, and she perished in the flames which had
consumed her tyrant. an awful pause of horror silenced each murmur of
the armed spectators, who, for the space of several minutes, stirred not
a finger, save to sign the cross. the voice of locksley was then heard,
â€œshout, yeomen!--the den of tyrants is no more! let each bring his
spoil to our chosen place of rendezvous at the trysting-tree in the
harthill-walk; for there at break of day will we make just partition
among our own bands, together with our worthy allies in this great deed
of vengeance.â€

 very large; for, notwithstanding that much was
consumed, a great deal of plate, rich armour, and splendid clothing,
had been secured by the exertions of the dauntless outlaws, who could be
appalled by no danger when such rewards were in view. yet so strict were
the laws of their society, that no one ventured to appropriate any
part of the booty, which was brought into one common mass, to be at the
disposal of their leader.

the place of rendezvous was an aged oak; not however the same to which
locksley had conducted gurth and wamba in the earlier part of the story,
but one which was the centre of a silvan amphitheatre, within half a
mile of the demolished castle of torquilstone. here locksley assumed his
seat--a throne of turf erected under the twisted branches of the huge
oak, and the silvan followers were gathered around him. he assigned to
the black knight a seat at his right hand, and to cedric a place upon
his left.

â€œpardon my freedom, noble sirs,â€ he said, â€œbut in these glades i

the numbers who hastened to execute this duty, considering that an
interesting division of spoil was about to take place, showed how much
the troop had at heart the safety of their spiritual father.

â€œmeanwhile, let us proceed,â€ said locksley; â€œfor when this bold deed
shall be sounded abroad, the bands of de bracy, of malvoisin, and other
allies of front-de-boeuf, will be in motion against us, and it were well
for our safety that we retreat from the vicinity.--noble cedric,â€ he
said, turning to the saxon, â€œthat spoil is divided into two portions; do
thou make choice of that which best suits thee, to recompense thy people
who were partakers with us in this adventure.â€

â€œgood yeoman,â€ said cedric, â€œmy heart is oppressed

â€œnay, but,â€ said the chief outlaw, â€œwe did but half the work at
most--take of the spoil what may reward your own neighbours and
followers.â€

â€œi am rich enough to reward them from mine own wealth,â€ answered cedric.

â€œand some,â€ said wamba, â€œhave been wise enough to reward themselves;
they do not march off empty-handed altogether. we do not all wear
motley.â€

â€œthey are welcome,â€ said locksley; â€œour laws bind none but ourselves.â€

â€œbut, thou, my poor knave,â€ said cedric, turning about and embracing
his jester, â€œhow shall i reward thee, who feared not to give thy body
to chains and death instead of mine!--all forsook me, when the poor fool
was faithful!â€

a tear stood in the eye of the rough thane as he spoke--a mark of
feeling which even the death of athelstane had not extracted; but there
was something in the half-instinctive attachment of his clown, that
waked his natur

for the future, as well as of grateful thankfulness for the past
deliverance--she knew that ivanhoe was safe, and she knew that
athelstane was dead. the former assurance filled her with the most
sincere delight; and if she did not absolutely rejoice at the latter,
she might be pardoned for feeling the full advantage of being freed
from further persecution on the only subject in which she had ever been
contradicted by her guardian cedric.

as rowena bent her steed towards locksleyâ€™s seat, that bold yeoman, with
all his followers, rose to receive her, as if by a general instinct of
courtesy. the blood rose to her cheeks, as, courteously waving her hand,
and bending so low that her beautiful and loose tresses were for an
instant mixed with the flowing mane of her palfrey, she expressed in
few but apt words her obligations and her gratitude to locksley and her
other deliverers.--â€œgod bless you, brave men,â€ she concluded, â€œgod and

freedom, and never ranger ask whose arrow hath struck down the deer.â€

â€œthanks, gentle lady,â€ said locksley; â€œthanks from my company and
myself. but, to have saved you requites itself. we who walk the
greenwood do many a wild deed, and the lady rowenaâ€™s deliverance may be
received as an atonement.â€

again bowing from her palfrey, rowena turned to depart; but pausing a
moment, while cedric, who was to attend her, was also taking his leave,
she found herself unexpectedly close by the prisoner de bracy. he stood
under a tree in deep meditation, his arms crossed upon his breast,

paid the same rude and spontaneous homage to death, which they had
so lately rendered to beauty--the slow chant and mournful step of the
priests brought back to their remembrance such of their comrades as had
fallen in the yesterdayâ€™s array. but such recollections dwell not long
with those who lead a life of danger and enterprise, and ere the sound
of the death-hymn had died on the wind, the outlaws were again busied in
the distribution of their spoil.

â€œvaliant knight,â€ said locksley to the black champion, â€œwithout whose
good heart and mighty arm our enterprise must altogether have failed,
will it please you to take from that mass of spoil whatever may best
serve to pleasure you, and to remind you of this my trysting-tree?â€

â€œi accept the offer,â€ said the knight, â€œas frankly as it is given; and i
ask permission to dispose of sir maurice de bracy at my own pleasure.â€

â€œhe is thine already,â€ said locksley, â€œand well for him! else the

â€œlong live our leader!â€ shouted the yeomen, â€œand long live the black
knight of the fetterlock!--may he soon use our service, to prove how
readily it will be paid.â€

locksley now proceeded to the distribution of the spoil, which he
performed with the most laudable impartiality. a tenth part of the whole
was set apart for the church, and for pious uses; a portion was next
allotted to a sort of public treasury; a part was assigned to the widows
and children of those who had fallen, or to be expended in masses for
the souls of such as had left no surviving family. the rest was divided
amongst the outlaws, according to their rank and merit, and the judgment

isaac groaned deeply, and began to wring his hands, and to relapse into
his state of desolation and despair. but the leader of the yeomen led
him aside.

â€œadvise thee well, isaac,â€ said locksley, â€œwhat thou wilt do in this
matter; my counsel to thee is to make a friend of this churchman. he is
vain, isaac, and he is covetous; at least he needs money to supply his
profusion. thou canst easily gratify his greed; for think not that i am
blinded by thy pretexts of poverty. i am intimately acquainted, isaac,

me, and also of the gymmal rings, jewels, and fair vestures, of which
i have been despoiled, having now satisfied you for my ransom as a true
prisoner.â€

â€œtouching your brethren, sir prior,â€ said locksley, â€œthey shall have
present freedom, it were unjust to detain them; touching your horses
and mules, they shall also be restored, with such spending-money as may
enable you to reach york, for it were cruel to deprive you of the means
of journeying.--but as concerning rings, jewels, chains, and what else,

it remained that the jew should produce some security for the ransom
which he was to pay on the priorâ€™s account, as well as upon his own. he
gave, accordingly, an order sealed with his signet, to a brother of his
tribe at york, requiring him to pay to the bearer the sum of a thousand
crowns, and to deliver certain merchandises specified in the note.

â€œmy brother sheva,â€ he said, groaning deeply, â€œhath the key of my

â€œno, no--may heaven forefend!â€ said isaac; â€œevil is the hour that let

side.--meanwhile we part friends, do we not?â€

â€œthere is my hand upon it,â€ said locksley; â€œand i will call it the hand
of a true englishman, though an outlaw for the present.â€

â€œand there is mine in return,â€ said the knight, â€œand i hold it honoured
by being clasped with yours. for he that does good, having the unlimited
power to do evil, deserves praise not only for the good which he
performs, but for the evil which he forbears. fare thee well, gallant

â€œpin the villains to the earth with my lance, wamba, if they offered us
any impediment.â€

â€œbut what if there were four of them?â€

â€œthey should drink of the same cup,â€ answered the knight.

â€œwhat if six,â€ continued wamba, â€œand we as we now are, barely two--would
you not remember locksleyâ€™s horn?â€

â€œwhat! sound for aid,â€ exclaimed the knight, â€œagainst a score of such

the wind drives the withered leaves?â€

â€œnay, then,â€ said wamba, â€œi will pray you for a close sight of that same

to defend himself on so many points at nearly the same moment, when
a grey-goose shaft suddenly stretched on the earth one of the most
formidable of his assailants, and a band of yeomen broke forth from the
glade, headed by locksley and the jovial friar, who, taking ready and
effectual part in the fray, soon disposed of the ruffians, all of whom
lay on the spot dead or mortally wounded. the black knight thanked his
deliverers with a dignity they had not observed in his former bearing,
which hitherto had seemed rather that of a blunt bold soldier, than of a
person of exalted rank.
