Maria Vasilevna Voynitskaya (maria vasilevna vaynitskaya)  - 
      Maria is Voynitsky's mother. She is still enthralled with the professor, and passes her days usually annotating pamphlets on various social issues. Voynitsky probably describes her best in Act I: as a woman with one eye "fastened on the grave" and the other fixed on "her books of learning for the dawn of a new life."
