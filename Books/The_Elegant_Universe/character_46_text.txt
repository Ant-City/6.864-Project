during the last thirty years of his life, albert einstein sought relentlessly for a so-called unified field
theory—a  theory  capable  of  describing  nature's  forces  within  a  single,  all-encompassing,  coherent
framework. einstein was not motivated by the th

chapter 12, the most recent insights show that these other kinds of ingredients do have an important
role in string theory, and have revealed that string theory is actually part of an even grander synthesis
currently (and mysteriously) named m-theory. these latest developments will be the subject of the
final chapters of this book.

progress in science proceeds in fits and starts. some periods are filled with great breakthroughs;
at other times researchers experience dry spells. scientists put forward results, both theoretical and
experimental. the results are debated by the community, sometimes they are discarded, sometimes
they  are  modified,  and  sometimes  they  provide  inspirational  jumping-off  points  for  new  and  more

enough, we would not even know it was happening. this is one of those rare instances in physics in
which the lack of a striking observable phenomenon is cause for great excitement. the absence of an
observable calamitous consequence from such an exotic geometrical evolution is testament to how far
beyond einstein's expectations string theory has gone.

beyond strings: in search of m-theory

in  his  long  search  for  a  unified  theory,  einstein  reflected  on  whether  "god  could  have  made  the
universe in a different way; that is, whether the necessity of logical simplicity leaves any freedom at
all."1 with this remark, einstein articulated the nascent form of a view that is currently shared by
many physicists: if there is a final theory of nature, one of the most convincing arguments in support of
its particular form would be that the theory couldn't be otherwise. the ult

ee that the five string theories
were thought of as being completely separate. but, with the newfound insights emerging from recent
research,  as  indicated  in  figure  12.2,  we  see  that,  like  the  starfish's  five  arms,  all  of  the  string
theories are now viewed as a single, all-encompassing framework. (in fact, by the end of this chapter
we will see that even a sixth theory—a sixth arm—will be merged into this union.) this overarching
framework  has  provisionally  been  called  m-theory,  for  reasons  that  will  become  clear  as  we
proceed.  figure  12.2  represents  a  landmark  achievement  in  the  quest  for  the  ultimate  theory.
seemingly  disconnected  threads  of  research  in  string  theory  have  now  been  woven  together  into  a
single  tapestry—a  unique,  all-encompassing  theory  that  may  well  be  the  long-sought  theory  of
everything.

y separate theories.

figure 12.2 results from the second superstring revolution have shown that all five string theories
are actually part of a single, unified framework, tentatively called m-theory.

although  much  work  remains  to  be  done,  there  are  two  essential  features  of  m-theory  that
physicists have already uncovered. first, m-theory has eleven dimensions (ten space and one time).
somewhat as kaluza found that one additional spatial dimension allowed for an unexpected merger of
general  relativity  and  electromagnetism,  string  theorists  have  realized  that  one  additional  spatial
dimension in string theory—beyond the nine space and one time dimensions discussed in preceding
chapters—allows for a deeply satisfying synthesis of all five versions of the theory. moreover, this
extra  spatial  dimension  is  not  pull

ed  out  of  thin  air;  rather,  string  theorists  have  realized  that  the

reasoning of the 1970s and 1980s that led to one time and nine space dimensions was approximate,
and  that  exact  calculations,  which  can  now  be  completed,  show  that  one  spatial  dimension  had
hitherto been overlooked.

the second feature of m-theory that has been discovered is that it contains vibrating strings, but
it  also  includes  other  objects:  vibrating two-dimensional  membranes,  undulating three-dimensional
blobs (called "three-branes"), and a host of other ingredients as well. as with the eleventh dimension,
this feature of m-theory emerges when calculations are freed from reliance on the approximations
used prior to the mid-1990s.

beyond these and a variety of other insights attained over the last few years, much of the true

are working with great vigor to acquire a full understanding of m-theory, and this may well constitute
the central problem of twenty-first-century physics.

an approximation method

the limitations of the methods physicists have been using to analyze string theory are bound up with
something  called perturbation  theory.  perturbation  theory  is  an  elaborate  name  for  making  an
approximation  to  try  to  give  a  rough  answer  to  a  question,  and  then  systematically  improving  this
approximation by paying closer attention to fine details initially ignor

e connection between these two string theories.

this is a very tidy story except that eleven-dimensional supergravity seems to have been left out
in  the  cold.  string  theory,  formulated  in  ten  dimensions,  appears  to  have  no  room  for  an  eleven-
dimensional theory. for a number of years, the general view held by most but not all string theorists
was that eleven-dimensional supergravity was a mathematical oddity without any connection to the
physics of string theory.12

glimmers of m-theory

the view now is very different. at strings '95, witten argued that if we start with the type iia string
and increase its coupling constant from a value much less than 1 to a value much greater than 1, the
physics we are still able to analyze (essentially that of the bps saturated configurations) has a low-
energy approximation that is eleven-dimensional supergravity.

when witten announced this discovery, it stunned the audience and it has since rocked the string
theory community. for almost e

constants we are led back to the theory of strings. but if the coupling constants are not small, no one
currently knows the answers.

figure  12.8  as  the  type  iia  string  coupling  constant  is  increased,  strings  expand  from  one-
dimensional loops to two-dimensional objects that look like the surface of a bicycle-tire inner tube.

whatever  the  eleven-dimensional  theory  is,  witten  has  provisionally  named  it m-theory.  the
name stands for as many things as people you poll. some samples: mystery theory, mother theory
(as in "mother of all theories"), membrane theory (since, whatever it is, membranes seem to be part
of  the  story),  matrix  theory  (after  some  recent  work  by  tom  banks  of  rutgers  university,  willy
fischler of the university of texas at austin, stephen shenker of rutgers university, and susskind
that offers a novel interpretation of the theory). but even without having a firm grasp o

m-theory and the web of interconnections

there is an old proverb about three blind men and an elephant. the first blind man grabs hold of the
elephant's ivory tusk and describes the smooth, hard surface that he feels. the second blind man grabs
hold of one of the elephant's legs. he describes the tough, muscular girth that he feels. the third blind
man grabs hold of the elephant's tail and describes the slender and sinewy appendage that he feels.
since their mutual descriptions are so different, and si

nce none of the men can see the others, each
thinks that he has grabbed hold of a different animal. for many years, physicists were as much in the
dark as the blind men, thinking that the different string theories were very different. but now, through
the insights of the second superstring revolution, physicists have realized that m-theory is the unifying
pachyderm of the five string theories.

in this chapter we have discussed changes in our understanding of string theory that arise when
we venture beyond the domain of the perturbative framework—a framework implicitly in use prior to
this chapter. figure 12.9 summarizes the interrelations we have found so far, with arrows to indicate

dual  theories. as  you  can  see,  we  have  a  web  of  connections,  but  it  is  not  yet  complete.  by  also

discussion.

figure 12.9 the arrows show which theories are dual to others.

the reason is that by providing a link between the type iia and type iib string theories, as well
as  between  the  heterotic-o  and  heterotic-e  theories,  the  large/small  radius  duality  completes  the
web of connections, as illustrated by the dotted lines in figure 12.10. this figure shows that all five
string theories, together with m-theory, are dual to one another. they are all sewn together into a
single theoretical framework; they provide five different approaches to describing one and the same
underlying  physics.  for  some  or  other  application,  one  phrasing  may  be  far  more  effective  than
another. for instance, it's far easier to work with the weakly coupled heterotic-o theory than it is to
work with the strongly coupled type i string. nevertheless, they describe exactly the same physics.

the overall picture

we can now more fully understand the two figures—figures 12.1 and 12.2—that we introduced in the
beginning of this chapter to summarize the essential points. in figure 12.1 we see that prior to 1995,

without  taking  any  dualities  into  account,  we  had  five  apparently  distinct  string  theories.  various
physicists worked on each, but without an understanding of the dualities they appeared to be different

of possibilities. this is represented in figure 12.1 by the shaded regions—each point in such a region
denotes one specific choice for the coupling constant and the curled-up geometry. without invoking
any dualities, we still have five disjointed (collections of) theories.

but now, if we apply all of the dualities we have discussed, then as we vary the coupling and
geometric parameters, we can pass from any one theory to any other, so long as we also include the
unifying central region of m-theory; this is shown in figure 12.2. even though we have only a scant
understanding of m-theory, these indirect arguments lend strong support to the claim that it provides a
unifying substrate for our five naively distinct string theories. moreover, we have learned that m-
theory is closely related to yet a sixth theory—eleven-dimensional supergravity—and this is recorded
in figure 12.11, a more precise version of figure 12.2.13

figure  12.11  illustrates  that  the  fundamental  ideas  and  equ

partially understood at the moment, unify those of all of the formulations of string theory. m-theory is

framework.

and m-theory are merged together into a unified framework.

a surprising feature of m-theory: democracy in extension

when the string coupling constant is small in any of the upper five peninsular regions of the theory
map in figure 12.11, the fundamental ingredient of the theory appears to be a one-dimensional string.
we  have,  however,  just  gained  a  new  perspective  on  this  observation.  if  we  start  in  either  the
heterotic-e or type iia regions and turn the value of the respective string coupling constants up, we

what we do have is a far deeper understanding of the logical structure and theoretical reach of
string theory. prior to the realizations summarized in figure 12.11, the strong coupling behavior of
each  string  theory  was  a  black  box,  a  complete  mystery. as  on  maps  of  old,  the  realm  of  strong
coupling was uncharted territory, potentially filled with dragons and sea monsters. but now we see
that although the journey to strong coupling may take us through unfamiliar regions of m-theory, it
ultimately lands us back in the comfortable surrounds of weak coupling—albeit in the dual language
of what was once thought to be a different string theory.

duality and m-theory unite the five string theories and they suggest an important conclusion. it
may well be that there aren't other surprises, on par with the ones just discussed, that are awaiting our
discovery. once a cartographer can fill in every region on a spherical globe of the earth, the map is
done and geographical knowledg

 to say explorations in antarctica or on an
isolated island in micronesia are without scientific or cultural merit. it only means that the age of
geographic discovery is over. the absence of blank spots on the globe ensures this. the "theory map"
of figure 12.11 plays a similar role for string theorists. it covers the entire range of theories that can
be reached by setting sail from any one of the five string constructions. although we are far from a
full understanding of the terra incognita of m-theory, there are no blank regions on the map. like the
cartographer, the string theorist can now claim with guarded optimism that the spectrum of logically
sound  theories  incorporating  the  essential  discoveries  of  the  past  century—special  and  general
relativity;  quantum  mechanics;  gauge  theories  of  the  strong,  weak,  and  electromagnetic  forces;
supersymmetry; extra dimensions of kaluza and klein—is fully mapped out by figure 12.11.

the challenge to the string theorist—or p

erhaps we should say the m-theorist—is to show that

some point on the theory map of figure 12.11 actually describes our universe. to do this requires
finding the full and exact equations whose solution will pick out this elusive point on the map, and
then  understanding  the  corresponding  physics  with  sufficient  precision  to  allow  comparisons  with
experiment. as witten has said, "understanding what m-theory really is—the physics it embodies—
would  transform  our  understanding  of  nature  at  least  as  radically  as  occurred  in  any  of  the  major
scientific upheavals of the past."15 this is the program for unification in the twenty-first century.

higher-dimensional branes? how do the cosmological properties we have discussed change if string
theory happens to have a coupling constant whose value places us more toward the center of figure
12.11 rather than in one of the peninsular regions? that is, what is the impact of full-fledged m-theory
on the earliest moments of the universe? these central questions are now being studied vigorously.
already, one important insight has emerged.

m-theory and the merging of all forces

in  figure  7.1  we  showed  how  the  strengths  of  the  three  nongravitational  couplings  merge  together
when the temperature of the universe is high enough. how does the strength of the gravitational force
fit into this picture? before the emergence of m-theory, string theorists were able to show that with

ther three, as shown in figure 14.2. string theorists found that the mismatch
could be avoided by carefully molding the shape of the chosen calabi-yau, among other tricks of the
trade,  but  such  after-the-fact  fine  tuning  always  makes  a  physicist  uncomfortable.  since  no  one
currently knows how to predict the precise form of the calabi-yau dimensions, it seems dangerous to
rely upon solutions to problems that hinge so delicately on the fine details of their shape.

figure 14.2 within m-theory, the strengths of all four forces can naturally merge.

witten has shown, however, that the second superstring revolution provides a far more robust
solution. by investigating how the strengths of the forces vary when the string coupling constant is not
necessarily small, witten found that the gravitational force curve can be gently nudged to merge with
the other forces, as in figure 14.2, without any special molding of the calabi-yau portion of space.
although it is far too early to tell, this

 may indicate that cosmological unity is more easily achieved
by making use of the larger framework of m-theory.

the  developments  discussed  in  this  and  the  previous  sections  represent  the  first,  somewhat
tentative  steps  toward  understanding  the  cosmological  implications  of  string/m-theory.  during  the
coming years, as the nonperturbative tools of string/m-theory are sharpened, physicists anticipate that
some of the most profound insights will emerge from their application to cosmological questions.

but  without  currently  having  methods  that  are  sufficiently  powerful  to  understand  cosmology
according  to  string  theory  fully,  it  is  worthwhile  to  think  about  some  general  considerations
concerning the possible role of cosmology in the search for the ultimate theory. we caution that some

or  whether—like
asking general relativity to give insight into how hard you happened to toss a ball in the air—it is a
question  that  lies  forever  beyond  the  grasp  of  any  theory.  valiant  attempts  by  physicists  such  as
hawking and james hartle of the university of california at santa barbara have tried to bring the
question  of  cosmological  initial  conditions  within  the  umbrella  of  physical  theory,  but  all  such
attempts remain inconclusive. in the context of string/m-theory, our cosmological understanding is, at
present, just too primitive to determine whether our candidate "theory of everything" truly lives up to
its name and determines its own cosmological initial conditions, thereby elevating them to the status
of physical law. this is a prime question for future research.

the central observation is that whereas in chapter 7 we noted that everything we know points
toward  a  consistent  and  uniform  physics  throughout  our  universe,  this  may  have  no  be

to the one we inhabit. and moreover, we can imagine that this wealth of universes may be physically
realized, leading to a multiverse—something that, at first sight, forever limits our predictive power.
in fact, however, this discussion illustrates that an ultimate explanation can yet be achieved, so long
as we grasp not only the ultimate laws but also their implications for cosmological evolution on an
unexpectedly grand scale.

undoubtedly, the cosmological implications of string/m-theory will be a major field of study
well into the twenty-first century. without accelerators capable of producing planck-scale energies,
we will increasingly have to rely on the cosmological accelerator of the big bang, and the relics it has
left for us throughout the universe, for our experimental data. with luck and perseverance, we may
finally be able to answer questions such as how the universe began, and why it has evolved to the
form we behold in the heavens and on earth. there is, of course,

prospects

centuries from now, superstring theory, or its evolution within m-theory, may have developed so far
beyond our current formulation that it might be unrecognizable even to today's leading researchers. as
we continue to seek the ultimate theory, we may well find that string theory is but one of many pivotal
steps on a path toward a far grander conception of the cosmos—a conception that involves ideas that
differ radically from anything we have previously encountered. the history of science teaches us that

shot of the horizon, we run up against a clash of paradigms when we try to envision a
universe that is, but that somehow does not invoke the concepts of space or time. nevertheless, it is
likely that we will need to come to terms with such ideas and understand their implementation before
we  can  fully  assess  string  theory.  the  reason  is  that  our  present  formulation  of  string  theory
presupposes the existence of space and time within which strings (and the other ingredients found in
m-theory) move about and vibrate. this allows us to deduce the physical properties of string theory
in a universe with one time dimension, a certain number of extended space dimensions (usually taken
to  be  three),  and  additional  dimensions  that  are  curled  up  into  one  of  the  shapes  allowed  by  the
equations of the theory. but this is somewhat like assessing an artist's creative talent by requiring that

coherent  string  vibrations  emerges,  yielding  the  conventional  notions  of  space  and  time.  such  a
framework, if realized, would show that space, time, and, by association, dimension are not essential

defining elements of the universe. rather, they are convenient notions that emerge from a more basic,
atavistic, and primary state.

already,  cutting-edge  research  on  aspects  of  m-theory,  spearheaded  by  stephen  shenker,
edward witten, tom banks, willy fischler, leonard susskind, and others too numerous to name, has
shown that something known as a zero-brane—possibly the most fundamental ingredient in m-theory,
an object that behaves somewhat like a point particle at large distances but has drastically different
properties at short ones—may give us a glimpse of the spaceless and timeless realm. their work has
revealed  that  whereas  strings  show  us  that  conventional

the strategy of beginning with a theoretical description that is classical and then subsequently
including the features of quantum mechanics has been extremely fruitful for many years. it underlies,
for example, the standard model of particle physics. but it is possible, and there is growing evidence
that it is likely, that this method is too conservative for dealing with theories that are as far-reaching
as string theory and m-theory. the reason is that once we realize that the universe is governed by
quantum-mechanical principles, our theories really should be quantum mechanical from the start. we
have successfully gotten away with starting from a classical perspective until now because we have
not been probing the universe at a deep enough level for this coarse approach to mislead us. but with
the  depth  of  string/m-theory,  we  may  well  have  come  to  the  end  of  the  line  for  this  battle-tested

currently, no one knows how to do this. but many string theorists foresee a reformulation of how
quantum principles are incorporated into our theoretical description of the universe as the next major

the road from this "in principle" ratiocination to an "in practice" fact is encumbered by many
hurdles. in chapter 9 we described some of the technical obstacles, such as determining the form of
the extra dimensions, that currently stand in our way. in chapters 12 and 13 we placed these and other
obstacles in the broader context of our need for an exact understanding of string theory, which, as we
have  seen,  naturally  leads  us  to  the  consideration  of  m-theory.  no  doubt,  achieving  a  full
understanding  of  string/m-theory  will  require  a  great  deal  of  hard  work  and  an  equal  amount  of
ingenuity.

at every step of the way, string theorists have sought and will continue to seek experimentally
observable  consequences  of  the  theory.  we  must  not  lose  sight  of  the  long-shot  possibilities  for
finding evidence of string theory discussed in chapter 9. furthermore, as our understanding deepens

calculate the masses of the quarks or the strength of the electromagnetic force, numbers whose precise
values dictate so much about the universe? as in the previous sections, we will have to surmount
numerous theoretical hurdles on the way to these goals—currently, the most prominent is achieving a
full nonperturbative formulation of string/m-theory.

but is it possible that even if we had an exact understanding of string/-m-theory, framed within a
new and far more transparent formulation of quantum mechanics, we could still fail in our quest to
calculate  particle  masses  and  force  strength?  is  it  possible  that  we  would  still  have  to  resort  to
experimental  measurements,  rather  than  theoretical  calculations,  for  their  values? and,  moreover,
might it be that this failing does not mean that we need to look for an even

one highlight emerging from these considerations is the role of cosmology in determining the
implications of an ultimate theory. as we have discussed, superstring cosmology is a young field,
even by the youthful standards set by string theory itself. it will, undoubtedly, be an area of primary
research focus for years to come, and it is likely to be one of the major growth areas of the field. as
we  continue  to  gain  new  insight  into  the  properties  of  string/m-theory,  our  ability  to  assess  the

cosmological  implications  of  this  rich  attempt  at  a  unified  theory  will  become  ever  sharper.  it  is
possible,  of  course,  that  such  studies  may  one  day  convince  us  that,  indeed,  there  is  a  limit  to
scientific explanation. but it is also possible, to the contrary, that they will usher in a new era—an
era in which we can declare that a fundamental explanation of the universe has finally been found.

but even these paradigm-shaking discoveries are only part of a larger, all-encompassing story.
with  solid  faith  that  laws  of  the  large  and  the  small  should  fit  together  into  a  coherent  whole,
physicists are relentlessly hunting down the elusive unified theory. the search is not over, but through
superstring  theory  and  its  evolution  into  m-theory,  a  cogent  framework  for  merging  quantum
mechanics, general relativity, and the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces has finally emerged.

calculationally tractable understanding of superstring theory. already, through studies in m-theory,
we have seen glimpses of a strange new domain of the universe lurking beneath the planck length,
possibly one in which there is no notion of time or space. at the opposite extreme, we have also seen
that our universe may merely be one of the innumerable frothing bubbles on the surface of a vast and
turbulent cosmic ocean called the multiverse. these ideas are at the current edge of speculation, but
they may presage the next leap in our understanding of the universe.

s. and so, to understand the theory better string theorists study its
properties as the values of these parameters are varied over all possibilities. if the parameter values
are chosen to lie in any of the six peninsular regions of figure 12.11, the theory has the properties
inherent to one of the five string theories, or to eleven-dimensional supergravity, as marked. if the
parameter  values  are  chosen  to  lie  in  the  central  region,  the  physics  is  governed  by  the  still
mysterious m-theory.

14. we should note, though, that even in the peninsular regions there are some exotic ways in
which branes can have an effect on familiar physics. for example, it has been suggested that our three
extended spatial dimensions might themselves be a three-brane that is large and unfurled. if so, as we
go  about  our  daily  business  we  would  be  gliding  through  the  interior  of  a  three-dimensional
membrane. investigations of such possibilities are now being undertaken.

  two.  the  spacetime
dimension  of  lineland  is  also  two,  and  hence  their  paths  will  generally  intersect  (assuming  their
velocities  have  not  been  finely  tuned  to  be  exactly  equal).  similarly,  strings  sweep  out  two-
dimensional  spacetime  paths  (their  world-sheets);  for  two  strings  the  sum  in  question  is  therefore
four. this means that strings moving in four spacetime dimensions (three space and one time) will
generally intersect.

5. with the discovery of m-theory and the recognition of an eleventh dimension, string theorists
have begun studying ways of curling up all seven extra dimensions in a manner that puts them all on
more or less equal footing. the possible choices for such seven-dimensional manifolds are known as
joyce manifolds, after domenic joyce of oxford university, who is credited with finding the first
techniques for their mathematical construction.
