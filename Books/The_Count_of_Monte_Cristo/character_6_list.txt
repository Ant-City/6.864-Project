Abbe Faria - 
                    A
priest and brilliant thinker whom Dantes meets in prison. Abbe Faria
becomes Dantes's intellectual father: during their many years as
prisoners, he teaches Dantes history, science, art, and many languages.
He then bequeaths to Dantes his vast hidden fortune. Abbe Faria
is the most important catalyst in Dantes's transformation into the
vengeful Count of Monte Cristo.
