linen: the day started 
without fuss and the pantry shelves laid out with rows of jelly glasses and brown jugs 
and white stone-china jars with blue whirligigs and words painted on them: coffee, 
tea, sugar, ginger, cinnamon, allspice: and the bronze clock with the lion on top nicely 
dusted off. the dust that lion could collect in twenty-four hours! the box in the attic 
with all those letters tied up, well she’d have to go through that tomorrow. all those 
letters – george’s letters and john’s letters and her letters to them both – lying around 
for the children to find afterwards made her uneasy. yes, that would be tomorrow’s 
business. no use to let them know how silly she had been once. 

while she was rummaging around she found death in her mind and it felt clammy 
and unfamiliar. she had spent so much time preparing for death there was no need for 
bringing it up again. let it take care of itself now. when she was sixty she had felt very 
old, finished, and went around m

sking. little things, little things! they 
had been so sweet when they were little. granny wished the old days were back again 
with the children young and everything to be done over. it had been a hard pull, but 
not too much for her. when she thought of all the food she had cooked, and all the 
clothes she had cut and sewed, and all the gardens she had made – well, the children 
showed it. there they were, made out of her, and they couldn’t get away from that. 
sometimes she wanted to see john again and point to them and say, well, i didn’t do 
so badly, did i? but that would have to wait. that was for tomorrow. she used to think 
of him as a man, but now all the children were older than their father, and he would 
be a child beside her if she saw him now. it seemed strange and there was something 
wrong in the idea. why, he couldn’t possibly recognize her. she had fenced in a 
hundred acres once, digging the post holes herself and clamping the wires with just a 
negro boy to hel

p. that changed a woman. john would be looking for a young woman 
with the peaked spanish comb in her hair and the painted fan. digging post holes 
changed a woman. riding country roads in the winter when women had their babies

was another thing: sitting up nights with sick horses and sick negroes and sick children 
and hardly ever losing one. john, i hardly ever lost one of them! john would see that in 
a minute, that would be something he could understand, she wouldn’t have to explain 
anything! 

it made her feel like rolling up her sleeves and putting the whole place to rights 
again. no matter if cornelia was determined to be everywhere at once, there were a 
great many things left undone on this place. she would start tomorrow and do them. it 
was good to be strong enough for everything, even if all you made melted and 
changed and slipped under your hands, so that by

house too and a good husband that i loved and fine children out of 
him. better than i hoped for even. tell him i was given back everything he took away 
and more. oh, no, on, god, no, there was something else besides the house and the 
man and the children. oh, surely they were not all? what was it? something not given 
back… her breath crowded down under her ribs and grew into a monstrous frightening 
shape with cutting edges; it bored up into her head, and the agony was unbelievable: 
yes, john, get the doctor now, no more talk, my time has come. 

when this one was born it should be the last. the last. it should have been born 
first, for it was the one she had truly wanted. everything came in good time. nothing 
left out, left over. she was strong, in three days she would be as well as ever. better. a 
woman needed milk in her to have her full health. 

“mother, do you hear me?” 

“i’ve been telling you –“ 

“mother, father connolly’s here.”

just as before. he had cursed like a sailor’s parrot and said, “i’ll kill him for you.” don’t 
lay a hand on him, for my sake leave something to god. “now, ellen, you must believe 
what i tell you…” 

so there was nothing, nothing to worry about any more, except sometimes in the 
night one of the children screamed in a nightmare, and they both hustled out shaking 
and hunting for the matches and calling, “there, wait a minute, here we are!” john, 
get the doctor now. hapsy’s time has come. but there was hapsy standing by the bed 
in a white cap. 

“cornelia, tell hapsy to take off her cap. i can’t see her plain.” 

her eyes opened very wide and the room stood out like a picture she had seen 

somewhere. dark colors with the shadows rising towards the ceiling in long angles. the 
tall black dresser gleamed with nothing on it but john’s picture, enlarged from a little 
one, with john’s eyes very black when they should have be
