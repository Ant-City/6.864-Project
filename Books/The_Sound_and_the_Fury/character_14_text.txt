"maybe we'll be dry by the time we get to the house." quentin said.  
"it was all your fault." caddy said. "i hope we do get whipped." she put her 
dress on and versh buttoned it.  
"they wont know you got wet." versh said. "it dont show on you. less me

"are you going to tell, jason." caddy said.  
"tell on who." jason said.  
"he wont tell." quentin said. "will you, jason."  
"i bet he does tell." caddy said. "he'll tell damuddy."  

"he cant tell her." quentin said. "she's sick. if we walk slow it'll be too dark 
for them to see."  
"i dont care whether they see or not." caddy said. "i'm going to tell, myself. 
you carry him up the hill, versh."  
"jason wont tell." quentin said. "you remember that bow and arrow i 
made you, jason."  
"it's broke now." jason said.  
"let him tell." caddy said. "i dont give a cuss. carry maury up the hill,

"i'd sit in damuddy's chair." caddy said. "she eats in bed."  
"i'm hungry. " jason said. he passed us and ran on up the walk. he had his 
hands in his pockets and he fell down. versh went and picked him up.  
"if you keep them hands out your pockets, you could stay on your feet." 
versh said. "you cant never get them out in time to catch yourself, fat as

"dilsey." caddy said. "quentin's not eating his supper. hasn't he got to

"eat your supper, quentin." dilsey said. "you all got to get done and get 
out of my kitchen."  
"i dont want any more supper. quentin said.  
"you've got to eat if i say you have." caddy said. "hasn't he, dilsey." the 
bowl steamed up to my face, and versh's hand dipped the spoon in it and 
the steam tickled into my mouth.  
"i dont want any more." quentin said. "how can they have a party when 
damuddy's sick."  
"they'll have it down stairs." caddy said. "she can come to the landing and 
see it. that's what i'm going to do when i get my nightie on.  
"mother was crying. " quentin said. "wasn't she crying, dilsey."  

"dont you come pestering at me, boy." dilsey said. "i got to get supper for 
all them folks soon as you all get done eating."

"you're a skizzard." jason said. he began to cry.  
"you're a knobnut." caddy said. jason cried. his hands were in his pockets.  
"jason going to be rich man." versh said. "he holding his money all the

"that's where damuddy is." caddy said. "she's sick every day now. when 
she gets well we're going to have a picnic."  
"i knows what i knows." frony said.

"the one next to it is where we have the measles." caddy said. "where do

"let him look at it and he'll be quiet." caddy said. "hold up just a minute 
while i slip it out. there, benjy. look."  
i looked at it and hushed.  
"you humor him too much." mother said. "you and your father both. you 
dont realise that i am the one who has to pay for it. damuddy spoiled 
jason that way and it took him two years to outgrow it, and i am not strong 
enough to go through the same thing with benjamin."  
"you dont need to bother with him." caddy said. "i like to take care of him. 
dont i. benjy.  
"candace." mother said. "i told you not to call him that. it was bad enough

use them. benjamin." she said.

we didn't go to our room.  
"this is where we have the measles." caddy said. "why do we have to sleep 
in here tonight."  
"what you care where you sleep." dilsey said. she shut the door and sat 
down and began to undress me. jason began to cry. "hush." dilsey said.

bed and dilsey went to the door and stood with her hand on the light. "you 
all be quiet now, you hear." she said.  

"all right." caddy said. "mother's not coming in tonight." she said. "so we 
still have to mind me."  
"yes." dilsey said. "go to sleep, now."  
"mother's sick." caddy said. "she and damuddy are both sick."

the room went black, except the door. then the door went black. caddy 
said, "hush, maury" putting her hand on me. so i stayed hushed. we could 
hear us. we could hear the dark.  
it went away, and father looked at us. he looked at quentin and jason, 
then he came and kissed caddy and put his hand on my head.

niggers say a drowned man's shadow was watching for him in the water all 
the time. it twinkled and glinted, like breathing, the float slow like 
breathing too, and debris half submerged, healing out to the sea and the 
caverns and the grottoes of the sea. the displacement of water is equal to 
the something of something. reducto absurdum of all human experience, 
and two six-pound flat-irons weigh more than one tailor's goose. what a 
sinful waste dilsey would say. benjy knew it when damuddy died. he 
cried. he smell hit. he smell hit.  
     the tug came back downstream, the water shearing in long rolling 
cylinders, rocking the float at last with the echo of passage, the float 
lurching onto the rolling cylinder with a plopping sound and a long jarring 
noise as the door rolled back and two men emerged, carrying a shell. they 
set it in the water and a moment later bland came out, with the sculls. he 
wore flannels, a gray jacket and a stiff straw hat. either he or his mother
