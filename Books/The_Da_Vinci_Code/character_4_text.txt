sophie slumped.

teabing sensed that if they were to have any chance of postponing confrontation with the british
authorities long enough to find the grail, bold action had to be taken. "give me a minute," he said,
hobbling toward the cockpit.

"what are you doing?" langdon asked.

"sales meeting," teabing said, wondering how much it would cost him to persuade his pilot to
perform one highly irregular maneuver.



chapter 81

the hawker is on final approach.

simon edwards — executive services officer at biggin hill airport — paced the control tower,
squinting nervously at the rain-drenched runway. he never appreciated being awoken early on a
saturday morning, but it was particularly distasteful that he had been called in to oversee the arrest
of one of his most lucrative clients. sir leigh teabing paid biggin hill not only for a private
hangar but a "per landing fee" for his frequent arrivals and departures. usually, the airfield had
advance warning of his s

ion had brought
out an armed response team. now, eight policemen with handguns stood just inside the terminal
building, awaiting the moment when the plane's engines powered down. the instant this happened,
a runway attendant would place safety wedges under the tires so the plane could no longer move.
then the police would step into view and hold the occupants at bay until the french police arrived
to handle the situation.

the hawker was low in the sky now, skimming the treetops to their right. simon edwards went
downstairs to watch the landing from tarmac level. the kent police were poised, just out of sight,
and the maintenance man waited with his wedges. out on the runway, the hawker's nose tipped up,
and the tires touched down in a puff of smoke. the plane settled in for deceleration, streaking from
right to left in front of the terminal, its white hull glistening in the wet weather. but rather than
braking and turning into the terminal, the jet coasted calmly past the access lane and continued

he police streamed in,
taking up positions around the jet. edwards joined the kent chief inspector, who moved warily
toward the hatch. after several seconds, the fuselage door popped open.

leigh teabing appeared in the doorway as the plane's electronic stairs smoothly dropped down. as
he gazed out at the sea of weapons aimed at him, he propped himself on his crutches and scratched
his head. "simon, did i win the policemen's lottery while i was away?" he sounded more
bewildered than concerned.

simon edwards stepped forward, swallowing the frog in his throat. "good morning, sir. i apologize
for the confusion. we've had a gas leak and your pilot said he was coming to the terminal."

"yes, yes, well, i told him to come here instead. i'm late for an appointment. i pay for this hangar,
and this rubbish about avoiding a gas leak sounded overcautious."

"i'm afraid your arrival has taken us a bit off guard, sir."

"i know. i'm off my schedule, i am. between you and me, the new medication gives me the tin

e assures me i am free to go." remy checked his watch. "master, we
really are running late." he nodded toward the jaguar stretch limousine in the far corner of the
hangar. the enormous automobile was ebony with smoked glass and whitewall tires. "i'll bring the
car." remy started down the stairs.

"i'm afraid we cannot let you leave," the chief inspector said. "please return to your aircraft. both
of you. representatives from the french police will be landing shortly."

teabing looked now toward simon edwards. "simon, for heaven's sake, this is ridiculous! we
don't have anyone else on board. just the usual — remy, our pilot, and myself. perhaps you could
act as an intermediary? go have a look onboard, and verify that the plane is empty."

edwards knew he was trapped. "yes, sir. i can have a look."

"the devil you will!" the kent chief inspector declared, apparently knowing enough about
executive airfields to suspect simon edwards might well lie about the plane's occupants in an effort
to keep teab
