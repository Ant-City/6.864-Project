Adele Ratignolle - 
                Edna's close friend, Adele Ratignolle represents the
Victorian feminine ideal. She idolizes her children and worships
her husband, centering her life around caring for them and performing
her domestic duties. While her lifestyle and attitude contrast with
Edna's increasing independence, Adele unwittingly helps facilitate
her friend's transformation. Her free manner of discourse and expression,
typical of Creole women of the time, acts as a catalyst for Edna's
abandonment of her former reserved and introverted nature. Adele
is also a foil for Mademoiselle Reisz, whose independent and unconventional
lifestyle inspires Edna's transgressions.
