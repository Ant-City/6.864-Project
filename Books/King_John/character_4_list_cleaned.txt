the [CHARACTER]  - 
      
        illegitimate son of richard the lionhearted, the [CHARACTER]'s proper name is philip; he is named for his father, king philip. he claims his inheritance from his foster father but then gives it to his younger brother, choosing to become a knight instead. at first he is a mischievous figure, urging the french and english to unite to destroy angers and stealing money from monasteries (at john's request), but he soon becomes john's main supporter after all the king's lords abandon him. the [CHARACTER] speaks directly to the audience, interpreting and analyzing scenes. by the end of the play, his honorable behavior has made him look even better than john, but he has a string of bad luck when he loses half his army. he is persistent, though; he tries to declare war on louis even after peace has been declared.
