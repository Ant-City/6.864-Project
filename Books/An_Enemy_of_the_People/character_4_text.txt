e an hour late, mr. billing, you have to put up with cold meat.

billing (as he eats). it is uncommonly good, thank youâ€”remarkably good.

mrs. stockmann. my husband makes such a point of having his meals punctually, you know.

billing. that doesn't affect me a bit. indeed, i almost think i enjoy a meal all the better when i can sit down and eat all by myself, and undisturbed.

mrs. stockmann. oh well, as long as you are enjoying itâ€”. (turns to the hall door, listening.) i expect that is mr. hovstad coming too.

billing. very likely.

(peter stockmann comes in. he wears an overcoat and his official hat, and carries a stick.)

peter stockmann. good evening, katherine.

mrs. stockmann (coming forward into the sitting-room). ah, good eveningâ€”is it you? how good of you to come up and see us!

peter stockmann. i happened to be passing, and soâ€”(looks into the dining-room). but you have company with you, i see.

mrs. stockmann (a little embarrassed). oh, noâ€”it was quite by chance he came in

tle more economical, too.

mrs. stockmann (smiling). now you mustn't think that thomas and i are spendthrifts.

peter stockmann. not you, my dear; i would never think that of you. (points to the doctor's study.) is he not at home?

mrs. stockmann. no, he went out for a little turn after supperâ€”he and the boys.

peter stockmann. i doubt if that is a wise thing to do. (listens.) i fancy i hear him coming now.

mrs. stockmann. no, i don't think it is he. (a knock is heard at the door.) come in! (hovstad comes in from the hall.) oh, it is you, mr. hovstad!

hovstad. yes, i hope you will forgive me, but i was delayed at the printers. good evening, mr. mayor.

peter stockmann (bowing a little distantly). good evening. you have come on business, no doubt.

hovstad. partly. it's about an article for the paper.

peter stockmann. so i imagined. i hear my brother has become a prolific contributor to the "people's messenger."

hovstad. yes, he is good enough to write in the "people's messenger" when he

 has any home truths to tell.

mrs. stockmann (to hovstad). but won't youâ€”? (points to the dining-room.)

peter stockmann. quite so, quite so. i don't blame him in the least, as a writer, for addressing himself to the quarters where he will find the readiest sympathy. and, besides that, i personally have no reason to bear any ill will to your paper, mr. hovstad.

hovstad. i quite agree with you.

peter stockmann. taking one thing with another, there is an excellent spirit of toleration in the townâ€”an admirable municipal spirit. and it all springs from the fact of our having a great common interest to unite usâ€”an interest that is in an equally high degree the concern of every right-minded citizen.

hovstad. the baths, yes.

peter stockmann. exactlyâ€”-our fine, new, handsome baths. mark my words, mr. hovstadâ€”the baths will become the focus of our municipal

 life! not a doubt of it!

mrs. stockmann. that is just what thomas says.

peter stockmann. think how extraordinarily the place has developed within the last year or two! money has been flowing in, and there is some life and some business doing in the town. houses and landed property are rising in value every day.

hovstad. and unemployment is diminishing,

peter stockmann. yes, that is another thing. the burden on the poor rates has been lightened, to the great relief of the propertied classes; and that relief will be even greater if only we get a really good summer this year, and lots of visitorsâ€”plenty of invalids, who will make the baths talked about.

hovstad. and there is a good prospect of that, i hear.

peter stockmann. it looks very promising. inquiries about apartments and that sort of thing are reach

ing us, every day.

hovstad. well, the doctor's article will come in very suitably.

peter stockmann. has he been writing something just lately?

hovstad. this is something he wrote in the winter; a recommendation of the bathsâ€”an account of the excellent sanitary conditions here. but i held the article over, temporarily.

peter stockmann. ah,â€”some little difficulty about it, i suppose?

hovstad. no, not at all; i thought it would be better to wait until the spring, because it is just at this time that people begin to think seriously about their summer quarters.

peter stockmann. quite right; you were perfectly right, mr. hovstad.

hovstad. yes, thomas is really indefatigable when it is a question of the baths.

peter stockmann. well remember, he is the medical officer to the baths.

hovstad. yes, and what is more, they owe their existence to him.

peter stockmann. to him? indeed! it i

s true i have heard from time to time that some people are of that opinion. at the same time i must say i imagined that i took a modest part in the enterprise.

mrs. stockmann. yes, that is what thomas is always saying.

hovstad. but who denies it, mr. stockmann? you set the thing going and made a practical concern of it; we all know that. i only meant that the idea of it came first from the doctor.

peter stockmann. oh, ideas yes! my brother has had plenty of them in his timeâ€”unfortunately. but when it is a question of putting an idea into practical shape, you have to apply to a man of different mettle. mr. hovstad. and i certainly should have thought that in this house at least...

mrs. stockmann. my dear peterâ€”

hovstad. how can you think thatâ€”?

mrs. stockmann. won't you go in and have something, mr. hovstad? my husband is sure to be back directly.

hovstad. thank you, perhaps just a morsel. (goes into the dining-room.)

peter stockmann (lowering his voice a little). it is a curious thing that these farmers' sons never seem to lose their want of tact.

mrs. stockmann. surely it is not worth bothering about! cannot you and thomas share the credit as brothers?

peter stockmann. i should have thought so; but apparently some people are not satisfied with a share.

mrs. stockmann. what nonsense! you and thomas get on so capitally together. (listens.) t

dr. stockmann. at all events i assure you i don't waste money unprofitably. but i can't find it in my heart to deny myself the pleasure of entertaining my friends. i need that sort of thing, you know. i have lived for so long shut out of it all, that it is a necessity of life to me to mix with young, eager, ambitious men, men of liberal and active minds; and that describes every one of those fellows who are enjoying their supper in there. i wish you knew more of hovstad.

peter stockmann. by the way, hovstad was telling me he was going to print another article of yours.

dr. stockmann. an article of mine?

peter stockmann. yes, about the baths. an article you wrote in the winter.

dr. stockmann. oh, that one! no, i don't intend that to appear just for the present.

peter stockmann. why not? it seems to me that this would be the most opportune moment.

dr. stockmann. yes, very likelyâ€”under normal conditions. (crosses the room.)

mrs. stockmann (coming from the dining-room). has he gone?

dr. stockmann. yes, and in such a bad temper.

mrs. stockmann. but, dear thomas, what have you been doing to him again?

dr. stockmann. nothing at all. and, anyhow, he can't oblige me to make my report before the proper time.

mrs. stockmann. what have you got to make a report to him about?

dr. stockmann. hm! leave that to me, katherine. it is an extraordinary thing that the postman doesn't come.

(hovstad, billing and horster have got up from the table and come into the sitting-room. ejlif and morten come in after them.)

billing (stretching himself). ah!â€”one feels a new man after a meal like that.

hovstad. the mayor wasn't in a very sweet temper tonight, then.

dr. stockmann. it is his stomach; he has wretched digestion.

hovstad. i rather think it was us two of the "people's messenger" that he couldn't digest.

mrs. stockmann. i thought you came out of it pretty well with him.

hovstad. oh

rster. no, i don't mix myself up with those things.

billing. but do you not take an interest in public affairs?

horster. no, i don't know anything about politics.

billing. all the same, one ought to vote, at any rate.

horster. even if one doesn't know anything about what is going on?

billing. doesn't know! what do you mean by that? a community is like a ship; everyone ought to be prepared to take the helm.

horster. maybe that is all very well on shore; but on board ship it wouldn't work.

hovstad. it is astonishing how little most sailors care about what goes on on shore.

billing. very extraordinary.

dr. stockmann. sailors are like birds of passage; they feel equally at home in any latitude. and that is only an additional reason for our being all the more keen, hovstad. is there to be anything of public interest in tomorrow's "messenger"?

hovstad. nothing about municipal affairs. but the day after tomorrow i was thinking of printing your articleâ€”

dr. stockmann. ah, devil take itâ€

mrs. stockmann. i don't know; for the last day or two he has always been asking if the postman has not been.

billing. probably some country patient.

petra. poor old dad!â€”he will overwork himself soon. (mixes a glass for herself.) there, that will taste good!

hovstad. have you been teaching in the evening school again today?

petra (sipping from her glass). two hours.

billing. and four hours of school in the morning?

petra. five hours.

mrs. stockmann. and you have still got exercises to correct, i see.

petra. a whole heap, yes.

horster. you are pretty full up with work too, it seems to me.

petra. yesâ€”but that is good. one is so delightfully tired after it.

mrs. stockmann. come, come, ejlif!

billing (laughing). that's capital!

hovstad. don't you want to work as hard as that, morten?

morten. no, indeed i don't.

hovstad. what do you want to be, then?

morten. i should like best to be a viking,

ejlif. you would have to be a pagan then.

morten. well, i could become a pagan, couldn't i?

billing. i agree with you, morten! my sentiments, exactly.

mrs. stockmann (signalling to him). i am sure that is not true, mr. billing.

morten. and then shall be allowed to do anything we like?

ejlif. i should like so much to stay a little longerâ€”

mrs. stockmann. no, no; away you go, both of you, (the boys say good night and go into the room on the left.)

hovstad. do you really think it can do the boys any harm to hear such things?

mrs. stockmann. i don't know; but i don't like it.

petra. but you know, mother, i think you really are wrong about it.

mrs. stockmann. maybe, but i don't like itâ€”not in our own home.

petra. there is so much falsehood both at home and at school. at home one must not speak, and at school we have to stand and tell lies to the children.

horster. tell lies?

billing. oh, bother the meansâ€”!

horster. well if you are thinking of that, miss stockmann, i shall be delighted to provide you with a schoolroom. the great big old house my father left me is standing almost empty; there is an immense dining-room downstairsâ€”

petra (laughing). thank you very much; but i am afraid nothing will come of it.

hovstad. no, miss petra is much more likely to take to journalism, i expect. by the way, have you had time to do anything with that english story you promised to translate for us?

petra. no, not yet, but you shall have it in good time.

(dr. stockmann comes in from his room with an open letter in his hand.)

dr. stockmann (waving the letter). well, now the town will have something new to talk about, i can tell you!

dr. stockmann (standing still by the table). isn't it the universal opinion that our town is a healthy spot?

hovstad. certainly.

dr. stockmann. quite an unusually healthy spot, in factâ€”a place that deserves to be recommended in the warmest possible manner either for invalids or for people who are wellâ€”

mrs. stockmann. yes, but my dear thomasâ€”

dr. stockmann. and we have been recommending it and praising itâ€”i have written and written, both in the "messenger" and in pamphlets...

hovstad. well, what then?

dr. stockmann. and the bathsâ€”we have called them the "main artery of the town's life-blood," t

billing. "the town's pulsating heart" was the expression i once used on an important occasion.

dr. stockmann. quite so. well, do you know what they really are, these great, splendid, much praised baths, that have cost so much moneyâ€”do you know what they are?

hovstad. no, what are they?

mrs. stockmann. yes, what are they?

dr. stockmann. the whole place is a pest-house!

petra. the baths, father?

mrs. stockmann (at the same time), our baths?

hovstad. but, doctorâ€”

billing. absolutely incredible!

dr. stockmann. the whole bath establishment is a whited, poisoned sepulchre, i tell youâ€”the gravest possible danger to the public health! all the nastiness up at molledal, all that stinking filth, is infecting the water in the conduit-pipes leading to the re

horster. where the bathing-place is?

dr. stockmann. just there.

hovstad. how do you come to be so certain of all this, doctor?

dr. stockmann. i have investigated the matter most conscientiously. for a long time past i have suspected something of the kind. last year we had some very strange cases of illness among the visitorsâ€”typhoid cases, and cases of gastric feverâ€”

mrs. stockmann. yes, that is quite true.

dr. stockmann. at the time, we supposed the visitors had been infected before they came; but later on, in the winter, i began to have a different opinion

; and so i set myself to examine the water, as well as i could.

mrs. stockmann. then that is what you have been so busy with?

dr. stockmann. indeed i have been busy, katherine. but here i had none of the necessary scientific apparatus; so i sent samples, both of the drinking-water and of the sea-water, up to the university, to have an accurate analysis made by a chemist.

hovstad. and have you got that?

dr. stockmann (showing him the letter). here it is! it proves the presence of decomposing organic matter in the waterâ€”it is full of infusoria. the water is absolutely dangerous to use, either internally or externally.

mrs. stockmann. what a mercy you discovered it in time.

dr. stockmann. you may well say so.

hovstad. and what do you propose to do now, doctor?

dr. stockmann. to see the matter put right, naturally.

hovstad. can that be done?

dr. stockmann. it must

dr. stockmann. well, to your grandfather, then. the old boy will have something to be astonished at! i know he thinks i am crackedâ€”and there are lots of other people who think so too, i have noticed. but now these good folks shall seeâ€”they shall just see! (walks about, rubbing his hands.) there will be a nice upset in the town, katherine; you can't imagine what it will be. all the conduit-pipes will have to be relaid.

hovstad (getting up). all the conduit-pipesâ€”?

dr. stockmann. yes, of course. the intake is too low down; it will have to be lifted to a position much higher up.

petra. then you were right after all.

dr. stockmann. ah, you remember, petraâ€”i wrote opposing the plans before the work was begun. but at that time no one would listen to me. well, i am going to let them have it now. of course i have prepared a report for the baths committee; i have had it ready for a week, and was only waiting for this

(mrs. stockmann takes the packet and goes out through the dining-room.)

petra. what do you think uncle peter will say, father?

dr. stockmann. what is there for him to say? i should think he would be very glad that such an important truth has been brought to light.

hovstad. will you let me print a short note about your discovery in the "messenger?"

dr. stockmann. i shall be very much obliged if you will.

hovstad. it is very desirable that the public should be informed of it without delay.

dr. stockmann. certainly.

mrs. stockmann (coming back). she has just gone with it.

dr. stockmann. no, my good friends, don't let us have any of that nonsense. i won't hear anything of the kind. and if the baths committee should think of voting me an increase of salary, i will not accept it. do you hear, katherine?â€”i won't accept it.

dr. stockmann. that is very kind of you.

(he goes out; mrs. stockmann follows him into the hall.)

dr. stockmann (laughing). just imagineâ€”the old chap doesn't believe a word of all this about the water supply.

hovstad. oh that was it, then?

dr. stockmann. yes, that was what we were talking about. perhaps it is the same thing that brings you here?

hovstad. yes, it is, can you spare me a few minutes, doctor?

dr. stockmann. as long as you like, my dear fellow.

hovstad. have you heard from the mayor yet?

dr. stockmann. not yet. he is coming here later.

hovstad. i have given the matter a great deal of thought since last night.

dr. stockmann. well?

hovstad. from your point of view, as a doctor and a man of science, this affair of the water supply is an isolated matter. i mean, you do not realise that it involves a great many other things.

dr. stockmann. how, do you mean?â€”let us sit down, my dear fellow. no, sit here on the couch. (hovstad sits down on th
 
 ___________________________
 
e couch, dr. stockmann on a chair on the other side of the table.) now then. you mean thatâ€”?

hovstad. you said yesterday that the pollution of the water was due to impurities in the soil.

dr. stockmann. yes, unquestionably it is due to that poisonous morass up at molledal.

hovstad. begging your pardon, doctor, i fancy it is due to quite another morass altogether.

dr. stockmann. what morass?

hovstad. the morass that the whole life of our town is built on and is rotting in.

dr. stockmann. what the deuce are you driving at, hovstad?

hovstad. the whole of the town's interests have, little by little, got into the hands of a pack of officials.

dr. stockmann. oh, come!â€”they are not all officials.

hovstad. no, but those that are not officials are at any rate the officials' friends and adherents; it is the wealthy folk, the old families in the town, that have got us entirely in their hands.

 
 ___________________________
 

dr. stockmann. yes, but after all they are men of ability and knowledge.

hovstad. did they show any ability or knowledge when they laid the conduit pipes where they are now?

dr. stockmann. no, of course that was a great piece of stupidity on their part. but that is going to be set right now.

hovstad. do you think that will be all such plain sailing?

dr. stockmann. plain sailing or no, it has got to be done, anyway.

hovstad. yes, provided the press takes up the question.

dr. stockmann. i don't think that will be necessary, my dear fellow, i am certain my brotherâ€”

hovstad. excuse me, doctor; i feel bound to tell you i am inclined to take the matter up.

dr. stockmann. in the paper?

hovstad. yes. when i took over the "people's messenger" my idea was to break up this ring of self-opinionated old fossils who had got hold of all the influence.

dr. stockmann. but you know you told me yourself what the result had b

een; you nearly ruined your paper.

hovstad. yes, at the time we were obliged to climb down a peg or two, it is quite trueâ€”because there was a danger of the whole project of the baths coming to nothing if they failed us. but now the scheme has been carried through, and we can dispense with these grand gentlemen.

dr. stockmann. dispense with them, yes; but, we owe them a great debt of gratitude.

hovstad. that shall be recognised ungrudgingly, but a journalist of my democratic tendencies cannot let such an opportunity as this slip. the bubble of official infallibility must be pricked. this superstition must be destroyed, like any other.

dr. stockmann. i am whole-heartedly with you in that, mr. hovstad; if it is a superstition, away with it!

hovstad. i should be very reluctant to bring the mayor into it, because he is your brother. but i am sure you will agree with me that truth should be the

dr. stockmann. that goes without saying. (with sudden emphasis.) yes, butâ€”butâ€”

hovstad. you must not misjudge me. i am neither more self-interested nor more ambitious than most men.

dr. stockmann. my dear fellowâ€”who suggests anything of the kind?

hovstad. i am of humble origin, as you know; and that has given me opportunities of knowing what is the most crying need in the humbler ranks of life. it is that they should be allowed some part in the direction of public affairs, doctor. that is what will develop their faculties and intelligence and self respectâ€”

dr. stockmann. i quite appreciate that.

hovstad. yesâ€”and in my opinion a journalist incurs a heavy responsibility if he neglects a favourable opportunity of emancipating the massesâ€”th

dr. stockmann. yes, for the baths.

aslaksen. quite so, i understand. well, i have come to say that i will back that up by every means in my power.

hovstad (to the doctor). you see!

dr. stockmann. i shall be very grateful to you, butâ€”

aslaksen. because it may be no bad thing to have us small tradesmen at your back. we form, as it were, a compact majority in the townâ€”if we choose. and it is always a good thing to have the majority with you, doctor.

dr. stockmann. that is undeniably true; but i confess i don't see why such unusual precautions should be necessary in this case. it seems to me that such a plain, straightforward thing.

aslaksen.

 oh, it may be very desirable, all the same. i know our local authorities so well; officials are not generally very ready to act on proposals that come from other people. that is why i think it would not be at all amiss if we made a little demonstration.

hovstad. that's right.

dr. stockmann. demonstration, did you say? what on earth are you going to make a demonstration about?

aslaksen. we shall proceed with the greatest moderation, doctor. moderation is always my aim; it is the greatest virtue in a citizenâ€”at least, i think so.

dr. stockmann. it is well known to be a characteristic of yours, mr. aslaksen.

aslaksen. yes, i think i may pride myself on that. and this matter of the water supply is of the greatest importance to us small tradesmen. th

 would be an easy matter for me to set on foot some testimonial, if necessary.

dr. stockmann. a testimonial?

aslaksen. yes, some kind of an address of thanks from the townsmen for your share in a matter of such importance to the community. i need scarcely say that it would have to be drawn up with the greatest regard to moderation, so as not to offend the authoritiesâ€”who, after all, have the reins in their hands. if we pay strict attention to that, no one can take it amiss, i should think!

hovstad. well, and even supposing they didn't like itâ€”

aslaksen. no, no, no; there must be no discourtesy to the authorities, mr. hovstad. it is no use falling foul of those upon whom our welfare so closely depends. i have done that in my time, and no good ever comes of it. but no one can take exception to a reasonable and frank expression of a citizen's views.

dr. stockmann (shaking him by the hand). i can't tell you, dear mr. aslaksen, how extremely pleased i am to find such hearty support among

dr. stockmann. it is tremendously kind of you, mr. aslaksen; but i really cannot understand the necessity for all these precautions. it seems to me that the thing should go of itself.

aslaksen. the authorities are somewhat slow to move, doctor. far be it from me to seem to blame themâ€”

hovstad. we are going to stir them up in the paper tomorrow, aslaksen.

aslaksen. but not violently, i trust, mr. hovstad. proceed with moderation, or you will do nothing with them. you may take my advice; i have gathered my experience in the school of life. well, i must say goodbye, doctor. you know now that we small tradesmen are at your back at all events, like a solid wall. you have the compact majority on your side doctor.

dr. stockmann. i am very much obliged, dear mr. aslaksen, (shakes hands wi

aslaksen. are you going my way, towards the printing-office. mr. hovstad?

hovstad, i will come later; i have something to settle up first.

aslaksen. very well. (bows and goes out; stockmann follows him into the hall.)

hovstad (as stockmann comes in again). well, what do you think of that, doctor? don't you think it is high time we stirred a little life into all this slackness and vacillation and cowardice?

dr. stockmann. are you referring to aslaksen?

hovstad, yes, i am. he is one of those who are floundering in a bogâ€”decent enough fellow though he may be, otherwise. and most of the people here are in just the same caseâ€”see-sawing and edging first to one side and then to the other, so overcome with caution and scruple that they never dare to take any decided step.

dr. stockmann, yes, but aslaksen seemed to me so thoroughly well-intentioned.

hovstad. there is one thing i esteem higher than that; and that is for a man to be self-reliant and sure

 of himself.

dr. stockmann. i think you are perfectly right there.

hovstad. that is why i want to seize this opportunity, and try if i cannot manage to put a little virility into these well-intentioned people for once. the idol of authority must be shattered in this town. this gross and inexcusable blunder about the water supply must be brought home to the mind of every municipal voter.

dr. stockmann. very well; if you are of opinion that it is for the good of the community, so be it. but not until i have had a talk with my brother.

hovstad. anyway, i will get a lea

dr. stockmann. how can you suppose such a thing possible!

hovstad. it is conceivable. and in that caseâ€”

dr. stockmann. in that case i promise youâ€”. look here, in that case you may print my reportâ€”every word of it.

hovstad. may i? have i your word for it?

dr. stockmann (giving him the ms.). here it is; take it with you. it can do no harm for you to read it through, and you can give it me back later on.

hovstad. good, good! that is what i will do. and now goodbye, doctor.

dr. stockmann. goodbye, goodbye. you will see everything will run quite smoothly, mr. hovstadâ€”quite smoothly.

hovstad. hm!â€”we shall see. (bows and goes out.)

dr. stockmann (opens the dining-room door and looks in). katherine! oh, you are back, petra?

billing. well, i must say!

hovstad (still writing). have you read it through?

billing (laying the ms. on the desk). yes, indeed i have.

hovstad. don't you think the doctor hits them pretty hard?

hovstad. yes, but they are not the people to throw up the spong

hovstad (turning round). hush!â€”speak so that aslaksen cannot hear you.

billing (lowering his voice). aslaksen is a chicken-hearted chap, a coward; there is nothing of the man in him. but this time you will insist on your own way, won't you? you will put the doctor's article in?

hovstad. yes, and if the mayor doesn't like itâ€”

billing. that will be the devil of a nuisance.

hovstad. well, fortunately we can turn the situation to good account, whatever happens. if the mayor will not fall in with th

e doctor's project, he will have all the small tradesmen down on himâ€”the whole of the householders' association and the rest of them. and if he does fall in with it, he will fall out with the whole crowd of large shareholders in the baths, who up to now have been his most valuable supportersâ€”

billing. yes, because they will certainly have to fork out a pretty pennyâ€”

hovstad. yes, you may be sure they will. and in this way the ring will be broken up, you see, and then in every issue of the paper we will enlighten the public on the mayor's incapability on one point and another, and make it clear that all the positions of trust in the town, the whole control of municipal affairs, ought to be put in the hands of the liberals.

billing. that is perfectly true! i see it comingâ€”i see it coming; we are on the threshold of a revolution!

dr. stockmann. you may set to work and print it, mr. hovstad!

hovstad. has it come to that, then?

billing. hurrah!

dr. stockmann. yes, print away. undoubtedly it has come to that. now they must take what they get. there is going to be a fight in the town, mr. billing!

billing. war to the knife, i hope! we will get our knives to their throats, doctor!

dr. stockmann. this article is only a beginning. i have already got four or five more sketched out in my head. where is aslaksen?

dr. stockmann. noâ€”far from it, my dear fellow. no, they are about quite another matter. but they all spring from the question of the water supply and the drainage. one thing leads to another, you know. it is like beginning to pull down an old house, exactly.

billing. upon my soul, it's true; you find you are not done till you have pulled all the old rubbish down.

aslaksen (coming in). pulled down? you are not thinking of pulling down the baths surely, doctor?

hovstad. far from it, don't be afraid.

dr. stockmann. no, we meant something quite different. well, what do you think of my article, mr. hovstad?

hovstad. i think it is simply a masterpiece.

dr. stockmann. do you really think so? well, i am very pleased, very pleased.

hovstad. it is so clear and intelligible. one need have no special knowledge to understand the bearing of it. you will have every enlightened man on your side.

aslaksen. and every prudent man too, i hope?

aslaksen. in that case we may venture to print it.

dr. stockmann. i should think so!

hovstad. we will put it in tomorrow morning.

dr. stockmann. of courseâ€”you must not lose a single day. what i wanted to ask you, mr. aslaksen, was if you would supervise the printing of it yourself.

aslaksen. with pleasure.

dr. stockmann. take care of it as if it were a treasure! no misprintsâ€”every word is important. i will look in again a little later; perhaps you will be able to let me see a proof. i can't tell you how eager i am to see it in print, and see it burst upon the publicâ€”

dr. stockmann. â€”they have tried to degrade me, to make a coward of me, to force me to put personal interests before my most sacred convictions.

dr. stockmann. we only need to stand by one another, and it will all be perfectly easy. the revolution will be launched like a ship that runs smoothly off the stocks. don't you think so?

hovstad. for my part i think we have now a prospect of getting the municipal authority into the hands where it should lie.

aslaksen. and if only we proceed with moderation, i cannot imagine that there will be any risk.

dr. stockmann. who the devil cares whether there is any risk or not! what i am doing, i am doing in the name of truth and for the sake of my conscience.

(they show him to the door, and bow him out.)

hovstad. he may prove an invaluably useful man to us.

aslaksen. yes, so long as he confines himself to this matter of the baths. but if he goes farther afield, i don't think it would be advisable to follow him.

hovstad. hm!â€”that all dependsâ€”

billing. you are so infernally timid, aslaksen!

aslaksen. timid? yes, when it is a question of the local authorities, i am timid, mr. billing; it is a lesson i have learned in the school of experience, let me tell you. but try me in higher politics, in matt
 
 ___________________________
 
o, you aren't, i admit. but this is simply contradicting yourself.

aslaksen. i am a man with a conscience, and that is the whole matter. if you attack the government, you don't do the community any harm, anyway; those fellows pay no attention to attacks, you seeâ€”they go on just as they are, in spite of them. but local authorities are different; they can be turned out, and then perhaps you may get an ignorant lot into office who may do irreparable harm to the householders and everybody else.

hovstad. but what of the education of citizens by self governmentâ€”don't you attach any importance to that?

aslaksen. when a man has interests of his own to protect, he cannot think of everything, mr. hovstad.

hovstad. then i hope i shall never have interests of my own to protect!

billing. hear, hear!

aslaksen (with a smile). hm! (points to the desk.) mr. sheriff stensgaard was your predecessor at that editorial desk.

hovstad. are you, billing?

billing. well, yesâ€”but you must clearly understand i am only doing it to annoy the bigwigs.

aslaksen. anyhow, it is no business of mine. but if i am to be accused of timidity and of inconsistency in my principles, this is what i want to point out: my political past is an open book. i have never changed, except perhaps to become a little more moderate, you see. my heart is still with the people; but i don't deny that my reason has a certain bias towards the authoritiesâ€”t

hovstad. do you know anyone else who will advance the money for our paper and printing bill?

billing. it is an infernal nuisance that we don't possess some capital to trade on.

hovstad (sitting down at his desk). yes, if we only had that, thenâ€”

billing. suppose you were to apply to dr. stockmann?

hovstad (turning over some papers). what is the use? he has got nothing.

billing. no, but he has got a warm man in the background, old morten kiilâ€”"the badger," as they call him.

hovstad (writing). are you so sure he has got anything?

billing. good lord, of course he has! and some of it must come to the stockmanns. most probably he will do something for the children, at all events.

hovstad (turning half round). are you counting on that?

billing. counting on it? of course i am not counting on any

thing.

hovstad. that is right. and i should not count on the secretaryship to the bench either, if i were you; for i can assure youâ€”you won't get it.

billing. do you think i am not quite aware of that? my object is precisely not to get it. a slight of that kind stimulates a man's fighting powerâ€”it is like getting a supply of fresh bileâ€”and i am sure one needs that badly enough in a hole-and-corner place like this, where it is so seldom anything happens to stir one up.

hovstad (writing). quite so, quite so.

billing. ah, i shall be heard of yet!â€”now i shall go and write the appeal to the householders' association. (goes into the room on the right.)

petra. no, i have come on my own account. (takes a book out of her coat pocket.) here is the english story.

hovstad. why have you brought it back?

petra. because i am not going to translate it.

hovstad. but you promised me faithfully.

petra. yes, but then i had not read it, i don't suppose you have read it either?

hovstad. no, you know quite well i don't understand english; butâ€”

petra. quite so. that is why i wanted to tell you that you must find something else. (lays the book on the table.) you can't use this for the "people's messenger."

hovstad. why not?

petra. because it conflicts with all your opinions.

hovstad. oh, for that matterâ€”

petra. you don't understand me. the burden of this story is that there is a supernatural power that looks after the so-called good people in this world and makes everyt

hovstad. well, but that is all right. that is just what our readers want.

petra. and are you going to be the one to give it to them? for myself, i do not believe a word of it. you know quite well that things do not happen so in reality.

hovstad. you are perfectly right; but an editor cannot always act as he would prefer. he is often obliged to bow to the wishes of the public in unimportant matters. politics are the most important thing in lifeâ€”for a newspaper, anyway; and if i want to carry my public with me on the path that leads to liberty and progress, i must not frighten them away. if they find a moral tale of this sort in the serial at the bottom of the page, they will be all the more ready to read what is printed above it; the

hovstad (smiling). thank you for having such a good opinion of me. no; as a matter of fact that is billing's idea and not mine.

petra. billing's!

hovstad. yes; anyway, he propounded that theory here one day. and it is billing who is so anxious to have that story in the paper; i don't know anything about the book.

petra. but how can billing, with his emancipated viewsâ€”

hovstad. oh, billing is a many-sided man. he is applying for the post of secretary to the bench, too, i hear.

petra. do you really mean that?

hovstad. i think so sometimes.

petra. yes, in the ordinary affairs of everyday life, perhaps; i can understand that. but now, when you have taken a weighty matter in handâ€”

hovstad. this matter of your father's, you mean?

petra. exactly. it seems to me that now you must feel you are a man worth more than most.

hovstad. yes, today i do feel something of that sort.

petra. of course you do, don't you? it is a splendid vocation you have chosenâ€”to smooth the way for the march of unappreciated truths, and new and courageous lines of thought. if it were nothing more than because you stand fearlessly in the open and take up the cause of an injured manâ€”

hovstad. yes, petraâ€”miss petra.

petra. is it that, that is first and foremost with you? not the matter itself? not the truth?â€”not my father's big generous heart?

hovstad. certainlyâ€”of courseâ€”that too.

petra. no, thank you; you have betrayed yourself, mr. hovstad, and now i shall never trust you again in anything.

hovstad. can you really take it so amiss in me that it is mostly for your sakeâ€”?

petra. what i am angry with you for, is for not having been honest with my father. you talked to him as if the truth and the good of the community were what lay nearest to your heart. you have made fools of both my father and me. you are not the man you made yourself out to be. and that i shall never forgive you-never!

aslaksen. do you mean that it must come out of the municipal funds?â€”out of the ill-filled pockets of the small tradesmen?

peter stockmann. well, my dear mr. aslaksen, where else is the money to come from?

aslaksen. the gentlemen who own the baths ought to provide that.

peter stockmann. the proprietors of the baths are not in a position to incur any further expense.

aslaksen. is that absolutely certain, mr. mayor?

hovstad. it is, indeed.

peter stockmann. the most fatal part of it is that we shall be obliged to shut the baths for a couple of years.

hovstad. shut them? shut them altogether?

aslaksen. for two years?

peter stockmann. yes, the work will take as long as thatâ€”at least.

aslaksen. i'm damned if we will stand that, mr. mayor! what are we householders to live upon in the meantime?

peter stockmann. unfortunately, that is an extremely difficult question to answer, mr. aslaksen. but what would you have us do? do you suppose we shall have a single visitor in the town, if we go about proclaiming that our water is polluted, that we are liv

peter stockmann. what you say is lamentably true, mr. aslaksen. my brother has unfortunately always been a headstrong man.

dr. stockmann. ah iâ€”i knew there was something in the wind! but i won't hear a word of it. if anything of that sort is being set on footâ€”

hovstad. of what sort?

dr. stockmann. well, whatever it isâ€”whether it is a demonstration in my honour, or a banquet, or a subscription list for some presentation to meâ€”whatever it is, you most promise me solemnly and faithfully to put a stop to it. you too, mr. aslaksen; do you understand?

hovstad. you must forgive me, doctor, but sooner or later we must tell you the plain truthâ€”

dr. stockmann. what on earth do you want here, katherine?

mrs. stockmann. i should think you know very well what i want.

hovstad, won't you sit down? or perhapsâ€”

mrs. stockmann. no, thank you; don't trouble. and you must not be offended at my coming to fetch my husband; i am the mother of three children, you know.

dr. stockmann. nonsense!â€”we know all about that.

mrs. stockmann. well, one would not give you credit for much thought for your wife and children today; if you had had that, you would not have gone and dragged us all into misfortune.

dr. stockmann. are you out of your senses, katherine! because a man has

aslaksen. just what i say. moderation in everything.

mrs. stockmann. and that is why you wrong us, mr. hovstad, in enticing my husband away from his home and making a dupe of him in all this.

hovstad. i certainly am making a dupe of no oneâ€”

dr. stockmann. making a dupe of me! do you suppose i should allow myself to be duped!

mrs. stockmann. it is just what you do. i know quite well you have more brains than anyone in the town, but you are extremely easily duped, thomas. (to hovstad.) please do realise that he loses his post at the baths if you print what he has written.

aslaksen. that i won't, doctor.

dr. stockmann. of course you willâ€”

peter stockmann. ah!â€”may i ask then if mr. hovstad intends to join this agitation?

hovstad. no, mr. mayor.

aslaksen. no, mr. hovstad is not such a fool as to go and ruin his paper and himself for the sake of an imaginary grievance.

hovstad. i am not going to print it. i cannot and will not and dare not print it.

dr. stockmann. you dare not? what nonsense!â€”you are the editor; and an editor controls his paper, i suppose!

aslaksen. no, it is the subscribers, doctor.

peter stockmann. fortunately, yes.

aslaksen. it is public opinionâ€”the enlightened publicâ€”householders and people of that kind; they control the newspapers.

dr. stockmann. we have not got to the end yet. (to hovstad.) then it is quite impossible for you to print my article in the "people's messenger"?

hovstad. quite impossibleâ€”out of regard for your family as well.

mrs. stockmann. you need not concern yourself about his family, thank you, mr. hovstad.

peter stockmann (taking a paper from his pocket). it will be sufficient, for the guidance of the public, if this appears. it is an official statement. may i trouble you?

dr. stockmann. then give it me back.

(loud applause on all sides.)

hovstad. i, too, feel called upon to explain my position. dr. stockmann's agitation appeared to be gaining a certain amount of sympathy at first, so i supported it as impartially as i could. but presently we had reason to suspect that we had allowed ourselves to be misled by misrepresentation of the state of affairsâ€”

dr. stockmann. misrepresentationâ€”!

hovstad. and, in the matter before us, it is now an undoubted fact that dr. stockmann has public opinion against him. now, what is an editor's first and most obvious duty, gentlemen? is it not to work in harmony with his readers? has he not received a sort of tacit mandate to work persistently and assiduously for the welfare of those whose opinions he represents? or is it possible i am mistaken in that?

a few scattered voices. that is true! bravo, stockmann!

hovstad. but my duty to the community obliged me to break with him. and there is another consideration that impels me to oppose him, and, as far as possible, to arrest him on the perilous course he has adopted; that is, consideration for his familyâ€”

aslaksen. as chairman, i call upon the speaker to withdraw the ill-considered expressions he has just used.

peter stockmann. i quite agree with the chairman.

dr. stockmann. have you gone clean out of your senses, peter? i am sticking as closely to my subject as i can; for my subject is precisely this, that it is the masses, the majorityâ€”this infernal compact majorityâ€”that poisons the sources of our moral life and infects the ground we stand on.

hovstad. and all this because the great, broadminded majority of the people is prudent enough to show deference only to well-ascertained and well-approved truths?

dr. stockmann. ah, my good mr. hovstad, don't talk nonsense about well-ascertained truths! the truths of which the masses now approve are the very truths that the fighters at the outposts held to in the days of our grandfathers. we fighters at the outposts nowadays no longer approve of them; and i do not believe there is any other well-ascer

hovstad. but, instead of standing there using vague generalities, it would be interesting if you would tell us what these old marrowless truths are, that we are nourished on.

(applause from many quarters.)

dr. stockmann. oh, i could give you a whole string of such abominations; but to begin with i will confine myself to one well-approved truth, which at bottom is a foul lie, but upon which nevertheless mr. hovstad and the "people's messenger" and all the "messenger's" supporters are nourished.

hovstad. yes, it is true enough as far as they are concerned.

dr. stockmann. very well. but as soon as i extend the principle and apply it to two-legged animals, mr. hovstad stops short. he no longer dares to think independently, or to pursue his ideas to their logical conclusion; so, he turns the whole theory upside down and proclaims in the "people's messenger" that it is the barn-door hens and street curs that are t

dr. stockmann (looks in front of him; then a light seems to dawn on him and he says in amazement.) are such things conceivable? are such things possible?

hovstad. no, you tell him, aslaksen.

aslaksen. well, the fact is that, now we know the bearings of the whole affair, we think we might venture to put the "people's messenger" at your disposal.

dr. stockmann. do you dare do that now? what about public opinion? are you not afraid of a storm breaking upon our heads?

hovstad. your reasons for wishing to get the control of the baths are mainly scientific, i take it.

dr. stockmann. of course; it was for scientific reasons that i persuaded the old "badger" to stand in with me in the matter. so we will tinker at the conduit-pipes a little, and dig up a little bit of the shore, and it shan't cost the town a sixpence. that will be all rightâ€”eh?

hovstad. i think soâ€”if you have the "people's messenger" behind you.

aslaksen. the press is a power in a free community. doctor.

dr. stockmann. quite so. and so is public opinion. and you, mr. aslaksenâ€”i suppose you will be answerable for the householders' association?
