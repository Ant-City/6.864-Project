[CHARACTER]wise ([CHARACTER]) gamgee  - 
the hobbit who serves frodo, traveling with his master
on his quest to return the ring to mordor. [CHARACTER] is more practical
and sensible than frodo, but is also more emotional and less able
to control himself--as when he blurts out to faramir that faramir's
brother, boromir, was a traitor.
