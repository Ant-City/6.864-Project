ored it with the lofty tones of a great passion.

the picture of the tragedian stood enframed upon her desk. any one
may possess the portrait of a tragedian without exciting suspicion or
comment. (this was a sinister reflection which she cherished.) in the
presence of others she expressed admiration for his exalted gifts, as
she handed the photograph around and dwelt upon the fidelity of the
likeness. when alone she sometimes picked it up and kissed the cold
glass passionately.

her marriage to leonce pontellier was purely an accident, in this
respect resembling many other marriages which masquerade as the decrees
of fate. it was in the midst of her secret great passion that she met
him. he fell in love, as men are in the habit of doing, and pressed his
suit with an earnestness and an ardor which left nothing to be desired.
he pleased her; his absolute devotion flattered her. she fancied there
was a sympathy of thought and taste between them, in which fancy she
was mistaken. add to this the violent opp

p to his face and pressed his cheek against her
own. the action was full of love and tenderness. he sought her lips
again. then he drew her down upon the sofa beside him and held her hand
in both of his.

“now you know,” he said, “now you know what i have been fighting against
since last summer at grand isle; what drove me away and drove me back
again.”

“why have you been fighting against it?” she asked. her face glowed with
soft lights.

“why? because you were not free; you were leonce pontellier’s wife. i
couldn’t help loving you if you were ten times his wife; but so long as
i went away from you and kept away i could help telling you so.” she put
her free hand up to his shoulder, and then against his cheek, rubbing it
softly. he kissed her again. his face was warm and flushed.

“there in mexico i was thinking of you all the time, and longing for
you.”

“but not writing to me,” she interrupted.

“something put into my head that you cared for me; and i lost my senses.

“your wife!”

“religion, loyalty, everything would give way if only you cared.”

“then you must have forgotten that i was leonce pontellier’s wife.”

“oh! i was demented, dreaming of wild, impossible things, recalling men
who had set their wives free, we have heard of such things.”

“yes, we have heard of such things.”

“i came back full of vague, mad intentions. and when i got here--”

cheek.

“i realized what a cur i was to dream of such a thing, even if you had
been willing.”

edna walked on down to the beach rather mechanically, not noticing
anything special except that the sun was hot. she was not dwelling upon
any particular train of thought. she had done all the thinking which was
necessary after robert went away, when she lay awake upon the sofa till
morning.

she had said over and over to herself: “to-day it is arobin; to-morrow
it will be some one else. it makes no difference to me, it doesn’t
matter about leonce pontellier--but raoul and etienne!” she understood
now clearly what she had meant long ago when she said to adele
ratignolle that she would give up the unessential, but she would never
sacrifice herself for her children.

despondency had come upon her there in the wakeful night, and had never
lifted. there was no one thing in the world that she desired. there
was no human being whom she wanted near her except robert; and she even
realized that the day would come when he, too, and the thought of
him woul
