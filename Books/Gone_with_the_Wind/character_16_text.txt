hall jump and not jump," he shouted, giving her cheek
another pinch.  "it's me own neck, so it is.  and besides, missy,
what are you doing out here without your shawl?"

seeing that he was employing familiar maneuvers to extricate
himself from unpleasant conversation, she slipped her arm through
his and said:  "i was waiting for you.  i didn't know you would be
so late.  i just wondered if you had bought dilcey."

"bought her i did, and the price has ruined me.  bought her and
her little wench, prissy.  john wilkes was for almost giving them
away, but never will i have it said that gerald o'hara used
friendship in a trade.  i made him take three thousand for the two
of them."

"in the name of heaven, pa, three thousand!  and you didn't need
to buy prissy!"

"has the time come when me own daughters sit in judgment on me?"
shouted gerald rhetorically.  "prissy is a likely little wench and
so--"

"i know her.  she's a sly, stupid creature," scarlett rejoined
calmly, unimpressed by his uproar.

 all showed the mixture of two
races.  she was self-possessed and walked with a dignity that
surpassed even mammy's, for mammy had acquired her dignity and
dilcey's was in her blood.

when she spoke, her voice was not so slurred as most negroes' and
she chose her words more carefully.

"good evenin', young misses.  mist' gerald, i is sorry to 'sturb
you, but i wanted to come here and thank you agin fo' buyin' me
and my chile.  lots of gentlemens might a' bought me but they
wouldn't a' bought my prissy, too, jes' to keep me frum grievin'
and i thanks you.  i'm gwine do my bes' fo' you and show you i
ain't forgettin'."

"hum--hurrump," said gerald, clearing his throat in embarrassment
at being caught openly in an act of kindness.

dilcey turned to scarlett and something like a smile wrinkled the
corners of her eyes.  "miss scarlett, poke done tole me how you
ast mist gerald to buy me.  and so i'm gwine give you my prissy
fo' yo' own maid."

she reached behind her and jerked the little girl for

 legs like a bird and a
myriad of pigtails carefully wrapped with twine sticking stiffly
out from her head.  she had sharp, knowing eyes that missed
nothing and a studiedly stupid look on her face.

"thank you, dilcey," scarlett replied, "but i'm afraid mammy will
have something to say about that.  she's been my maid ever since i
was born."

"mammy getting ole," said dilcey, with a calmness that would have
enraged mammy.  "she a good mammy, but you a young lady now and
needs a good maid, and my prissy been maidin' fo' miss india fo' a
year now.  she kin sew and fix hair good as a grown pusson."

prodded by her mother, prissy bobbed a sudden curtsy and grinned
at scarlett, who could not help grinning back.

"a sharp little wench," she thought, and said aloud:  "thank you,
dilcey, we'll see about it when mother comes home."

"thankee, ma'm.  i gives you a good night," said dilcey and,
turning, left the room with her child, pork dancing attendance.
the supper things cleared away, gerald resumed

ow could he be planning to marry melanie when he really
loved her, scarlett?  and when he knew how much she loved him?
how could he deliberately break her heart?

then, suddenly, an idea, shining and new, flashed like a comet
through her brain.

"why, ashley hasn't an idea that i'm in love with him!"

she almost gasped aloud in the shock of its unexpectedness.  her
mind stood still as if paralyzed for a long, breathless instant,
and then raced forward.

"how could he know?  i've always acted so prissy and ladylike and
touch-me-not around him he probably thinks i don't care a thing
about him except as a friend.  yes, that's why he's never spoken!
he thinks his love is hopeless.  and that's why he's looked so--"

her mind went swiftly back to those times when she had caught him
looking at her in that strange manner, when the gray eyes that
were such perfect curtains for his thoughts had been wide and
naked and had in them a look of torment and despair.

"he's been broken hearted because he thi

three lonely women are better than two.  and perhaps dear scarlett
could find some ease for her sorrow, as melly is doing, by nursing
our brave boys in the hospitals here--and, of course, melly and i
are longing to see the dear baby. . . ."

so scarlett's trunk was packed again with her mourning clothes and
off she went to atlanta with wade hampton and his nurse prissy, a
headful of admonitions as to her conduct from ellen and mammy and
a hundred dollars in confederate bills from gerald.  she did not
especially want to go to atlanta.  she thought aunt pitty the
silliest of old ladies and the very idea of living under the same
roof with ashley's wife was abhorrent.  but the county with its
memories was impossible now, and any change was welcome.

chapter viii


as the train carried scarlett northward that may morning in 1862,
she thought that at

ously a spare old negro, with grizzled kinks and an air of
dignified authority, came toward her through the mud, his hat in
his hand.

"dis miss scarlett, ain' it?  dis hyah peter, miss pitty's
coachman.  doan step down in dat mud," he ordered severely, as
scarlett gathered up her skirts preparatory to descending.  "you
is as bad as miss pitty an' she lak a chile 'bout gittin' her
feets wet.  lemme cahy you."

he picked scarlett up with ease despite his apparent frailness and
age and, observing prissy standing on the platform of the train,
the baby in her arms, he paused:  "is dat air chile yo' nuss?
miss scarlett, she too young ter be handlin' mist' charles'
onlies' baby!  but we ten' to dat later.  you gal, foller me, an'
doan you go drappin' dat baby."

scarlett submitted meekly to being carried toward the carriage and
also to the peremptory manner in which uncle peter criticized her
and prissy.  as they went through the mud with prissy sloshing,
pouting, after them, she recalled what cha

charles' words were confirmed as peter climbed onto the box and
took the whip.

"miss pitty in a state bekase she din' come ter meet you.  she's
feared you mout not unnerstan' but ah tole her she an' miss melly
jes' git splashed wid mud an' ruin dey new dresses an' ah'd
'splain ter you.  miss scarlett, you better tek dat chile.  dat
lil pickaninny gwine let it drap."

scarlett looked at prissy and sighed.  prissy was not the most
adequate of nurses.  her recent graduation from a skinny
pickaninny with brief skirts and stiffly wrapped braids into the
dignity of a calico dress and starched white turban was an
intoxicating affair.  she would never have arrived at this
eminence so early in life had not the exigencies of war and the
demands of the commissary department on tara made it impossible
for ellen to spare mammy or dilcey or even rosa or teena.  prissy
had never been more than a m

the twenty-mile journey from jonesboro to atlanta had so excited
her that scarlett had been forced to hold the baby all the way.
now, the sight of so many buildings and people completed prissy's
demoralization.  she twisted from side to side, pointed, bounced
about and so jounced the baby that he wailed miserably.

scarlett longed for the fat old arms of mammy.  mammy had only to
lay hands on a child and it hushed crying.  but mammy was at tara
and there was nothing scarlett could do.  it was useless for her
to take little wade from prissy.  he yelled just as loudly when
she held him as when prissy did.  besides, he would tug at the
ribbons of her bonnet and, no doubt, rumple her dre

ss.  so she
pretended she had not heard uncle peter's suggestion.

"maybe i'll learn about babies sometime," she thought irritably,
as the carriage jolted and swayed out of the morass surrounding
the station, "but i'm never going to like fooling with them."  and
as wade's face went purple with his squalling, she snapped
crossly:  "give him that sugar-tit in your pocket, priss.
anything to make him hush.  i know he's hungry, but i can't do
anything about that now."

prissy produced the sugar-tit, given her that morning by mammy,
and the baby's wails subsided.  with quiet restored and with the
new sights that met her eyes, scarlest's spirits began to rise a
little.  when uncle peter finally maneuvered the carriage out of
the mudholes and onto peachtree street, she felt the first surge
of interest she had known in months.  how the town had grown!  it
was not much more than a year since she had last been here, and it
did not seem possible that the little atlanta she

rming memory was still on her of
how the home guard and the militia and the soldiers from the
hospital had fought for her dances last night.  of all the people
in the world, she didn't want melly for a defender.  she could
defend herself, thank you, and if the old cats wanted to squall--
well, she could get along without the old cats.  there were too
many nice officers in the world for her to bother about what old
women said.

pittypat was dabbing at her eyes under melanie's soothing words
when prissy entered with a bulky letter.

"fer you.  miss melly.  a lil nigger boy brung it."

"for me?" said melly, wondering, as she ripped open the envelope.

scarlett was making headway with her waffles and so noticed
nothing until she heard a burst of tears from melly and, looking
up, saw aunt pittypat's hand go to her heart.

"ashley's dead!" screamed pittypat, throwing her head back and
letting her arms go limp.

"oh, my god!" cried scarlett, her blood turning to ice water.

"no!  no!" cried melanie

her father coming to town to talk to captain butler.  the real
seriousness of the matter grew on her.  gerald was going to be
severe.  this was one time when she knew she couldn't wiggle out
of her punishment by sitting on his knee and being sweet and pert.

"not--not bad news?" quavered pittypat.

"pa is coming tomorrow and he's going to land on me like a duck on
a june bug," answered scarlett dolorously.

"prissy, find my salts," fluttered pittypat, pushing back her
chair from her half-eaten meal.  "i--i feel faint."

"dey's in yo' skirt pocket," said prissy, who had been hovering
behind scarlett, enjoying the sensational drama.  mist' gerald in
a temper was always exciting, providing his temper was not
directed at her kinky head.  pitty fumbled at her skirt and held
the vial to her nose.

last night's bout and wondering suddenly if rhett butler had had
anything to do with that.



chapter xi


on an afternoon of the following week, scarlett came home from the
hospital weary and indignant.  she was tired from standing on her
feet all morning and irritable because mrs. merriwether had
scolded her sharply for sitting on a soldier's bed while she
dressed his wounded arm.  aunt pitty and melanie, bonneted in
their best, were on the porch with wade and prissy, ready for
their weekly round of calls.  scarlett asked to be excused from
accompanying them and went upstairs to her room.

when the last sound of carriage wheels had died away and she knew
the family was safely out of sight, she slipped quietly into
melanie's room and turned the key in the lock.  it was a prim,
virginal little room and it lay still and warm in the slanting
rays of the four-o'clock sun.  the floors were glistening and bare
except for a few bright rag rugs, and the white walls

men do--yea, passing the love of women."

his mouth twisted in his old smile and the seriousness was gone
from his face.  he lifted his wide panama hat.

"good-by.  i'm going to find dr. meade.  i imagine the irony of me
being the one to tell him of his son's death will be lost on him,
just now.  but later, he'll probably hate to think that a
speculator brought the news of a hero's death."



scarlett put miss pitty to bed with a toddy, left prissy and cookie
in attendance and went down the street to the meade house.  mrs.
meade was upstairs with phil, waiting her husband's return, and
melanie sat in the parlor, talking in a low voice to a group of
sympathetic neighbors.  she was busy with needle and scissors,
altering a mourning dress that mrs. elsing had lent to mrs. meade.
already the house was full of the acrid smell of clothes boiling in
homemade black dye for, in the kitchen, the sobbing cook was
stirring all of mrs. meade's dresses
 
 ___________________________
 
carlett must dress immediately and come to the
hospital.  fanny elsing and the bonnell girls, roused early from
slumber, were yawning on the back seat and the elsings' mammy sat
grumpily on the box, a basket of freshly laundered bandages on her
lap.  off scarlett went, unwillingly for she had danced till dawn
the night before at the home guard's party and her feet were tired.
she silently cursed the efficient and indefatigable mrs.
merriwether, the wounded and the whole southern confederacy, as
prissy buttoned her in her oldest and raggedest calico frock which
she used for hospital work.  gulping down the bitter brew of
parched corn and dried sweet potatoes that passed for coffee, she
went out to join the girls.

she was sick of all this nursing.  this very day she would tell
mrs. merriwether that ellen had written her to come home for a
visit.  much good this did her, for that worthy matron, her sleeves
rolled up, her stout figure swathed in a large apron, gave her one
sharp look and said: 
 
 ___________________________
 
rning afternoon, aunt pitty and her family, black and
white, stood in the sun with buckets of water and bandages, ladling
drinks, binding wounds until the bandages gave out and even the
torn sheets and towels were exhausted.  aunt pitty completely
forgot that the sight of blood always made her faint and she worked
until her little feet in their too small shoes swelled and would no
longer support her.  even melanie, now great with child, forgot her
modesty and worked feverishly side by side with prissy, cookie and
scarlett, her face as tense as any of the wounded.  when at last
she fainted, there was no place to lay her except on the kitchen
table, as every bed, chair and sofa in the house was filled with
wounded.

forgotten in the tumult, little wade crouched behind the banisters
on the front porch, peering out onto the lawn like a caged,
frightened rabbit, his eyes wide with terror, sucking his thumb and
hiccoughing.  once scarlett saw him and cried sharply:  "go play in
the back yard, wade

itty wants to take her servants with her.  it won't be for
long.  the baby ought to be here in another five weeks, but you

it may come any day."

so aunt pittypat went to macon, in floods of tears, taking uncle
peter and cookie with her.  the carriage and horse she donated to
the hospital in a burst of patriotism which she immediately
regretted and that brought on more tears.  and scarlett and melanie
were left alone with wade and prissy in a house that was much
quieter, even though the cannonading continued.



chapter xix


in those first days of the siege, when the yankees crashed here and
there against the defenses of the city, scarlett was so frightened
by the bursting shells she could only cower helplessly, her hands
over her ears, expecting every moment to be blown into eternity.
when she heard the whistling screams that heralded their approach,
she rushed to melanie's room and flung herself on the bed beside
her, and th

e two clutched each other, screaming "oh! oh!" as they
buried their heads in the pillows.  prissy and wade scurried for
the cellar and crouched in the cobwebbed darkness, prissy squalling
at the top of her voice and wade sobbing and hiccoughing.

suffocating under feather pillows while death screamed overhead,
scarlett silently cursed melanie for keeping her from the safer
regions below stairs.  but the doctor had forbidden melanie to walk
and scarlett had to stay with her.  added to her terror of being
blown to pieces was her equally active terror that melanie's baby
might arrive at any moment.  sweat broke out on scarlett with
clammy dampness, whenever this thought e
 
 ___________________________
 
ntered her mind.  what
would she do if the baby started coming?  she knew she'd rather let
melanie die than go out on the streets to hunt for the doctor when
the shells were falling like april rain.  and she knew prissy could
be beaten to death before she would venture forth.  what would she
do if the baby came?

these matters she discussed with prissy in whispers one evening, as
they prepared melanie's supper tray, and prissy, surprisingly
enough, calmed her fears.

"miss scarlett, effen we kain git de doctah w'en miss melly's time
come, doan you bodder.  ah kin manage.  ah knows all 'bout
birthin'.  ain' mah ma a midwife?  ain' she raise me ter be a
midwife, too?  jes' you leave it ter me."

scarlett breathed more easily knowing that experienced hands were
near, but she nevertheless yearned to have the ordeal over and done
with.  mad to be away from exploding shells, desperate to get home
to the quiet of tara, she

living or dead, she could not fail him, no matter what the cost.
so she remained day after day.

in response to ellen's letters, pleading with her to come home, she
wrote minimizing the dangers of the siege, explaining melanie's
predicament and promising to come as soon as the baby was born.
ellen, sensitive to the bonds of kin, be they blood or marriage,
wrote back reluctantly agreeing that she must stay but demanding
wade and prissy be sent home immediately.  this suggestion met with
the complete approval of prissy, who was now reduced to teeth-
chattering idiocy at every unexpected sound.  she spent so much
time crouching in the cellar that the girls would have fared badly
but for mrs. meade's stolid old betsy.

scarlett was as anxious as her mother to have wade out of atlanta,
not only for the child's safety, but because his constant fear
irritated her.  wade was terrified to speechlessness by the
shelling, and even when
 
 ___________________________
 
 lulls came he clung to scarlett's skirts,
too terrified to cry.  he was afraid to go to bed at night, afraid
of the dark, afraid to sleep lest the yankees should come and get
him, and the sound of his soft nervous whimpering in the night
grated unendurably on her nerves.  secretly she was just as
frightened as he was, but it angered her to be reminded of it every
minute by his tense, drawn face.  yes, tara was the place for wade.
prissy should take him there and return immediately to be present
when the baby came.

but before scarlett could start the two on their homeward journey,
news came that the yankees had swung to the south and were
skirmishing along the railroad between atlanta and jonesboro.
suppose the yankees should capture the train on which wade and
prissy were riding--scarlett and melanie turned pale at the
thought, for everyone knew that yankee atrocities on helpless
children were even more dreadful than on women
 
 ___________________________
 
s army within a few miles of tara!  and even if
the yankees should be defeated, they might fall back down the road
to tara.  and gerald couldn't possibly refugee out of their way
with three sick women.

oh, if she were only there now, yankees or not.  she paced the
floor in her bare feet, her nightgown clinging to her legs and the
more she walked the stronger became her foreboding.  she wanted to
be at home.  she wanted to be near ellen.

from the kitchen below, she heard the rattle of china as prissy
prepared breakfast, but no sound of mrs. meade's betsy.  the
shrill, melancholy minor of prissy was raised, "jes' a few mo'
days, ter tote de wee-ry load . . ."  the song grated on scarlett,
its sad implications frightening her, and slipping on a wrapper she
pattered out into the hall and to the back stairs and shouted:
"shut up that singing, prissy!"

a sullen "yas'm" drifted up to her and she drew a deep breath,
feeling suddenly ashamed of herself.

"where's betsy?"

"ah doan know.  she ain'

dn't know how she cared for
ashley?  or did she know everything and feel that because of that
love, scarlett would take good care of ashley's child?  scarlett
had a wild impulse to cry out questions, but they died on her lips
as melanie took her hand and held it for an instant against her
cheek.  tranquillity had come back into her eyes.

"why do you think it will be today, melly?"

"i've been having pains since dawn--but not very bad ones."

"you have?  well, why didn't you call me?  i'll send prissy for dr.
meade."

"no, don't do that yet, scarlett.  you know how busy he is, how
busy they all are.  just send word to him that we'll need him some
time today.  send over to mrs. meade's and tell her and ask her to
come over and sit with me.  she'll know when to really send for
him."

"oh, stop being so unselfish.  you know you need a doctor as much
as anybody in the hospital.  i'll send for him right away."

"no, please don't.  sometimes it takes all day having a baby and i

chapter xxi


after sending up melanie's breakfast tray, scarlett dispatched
prissy for mrs. meade and sat down with wade to eat her own
breakfast.  but for once she had no appetite.  between her nervous
apprehension over the thought that melanie's time was approaching
and her unconscious straining to hear the sound of the cannon, she
could hardly eat.  her heart acted very queerly, beating regularly
for several minutes and then thumping so loudly and swiftly it
almost made her sick at her stomach.  the heavy hominy stuck in her
throat like glue and never before had the mixtur

 on the south side of town and thanked god she was not
there.  if only everyone except the meades and the merriwethers had
not refugeed from this north end of peachtree!  it made her feel
forsaken and alone.  she wished fervently that uncle peter were
with her so he could go down to headquarters and learn the news.
if it wasn't for melanie she'd go to town this very minute and
learn for herself, but she couldn't leave until mrs. meade arrived.
mrs. meade.  why didn't she come on?  and where was prissy?

she rose and went out onto the front porch and looked for them
impatiently, but the meade house was around a shady bend in the
street and she could see no one.  after a long while prissy came
into view, alone, switching her skirts from side to side and
looking over her shoulder to observe the effect.

"you're as slow as molasses in january," snapped scarlett as prissy
opened the gate.  "what did mrs. meade say?  how soon will she be
over here?"

"she warn't dar," said prissy.

"where is she?

 when will she be home?"

"well'm," answered prissy, dragging out her words pleasurably to
give more weight to her message.  "dey cookie say miss meade done

miss meade she tuck de cah'ige an' ole talbot an' betsy an' dey

scarlett stared at her and had an impulse to shake her.  negroes
were always so proud of being the bearers of evil tidings.

"well, don't stand

c dey's at de horsepittle."

"so that's where you were so long!  whenever i send you somewhere
you go where i tell you and don't stop to 'pass any time' with
anybody.  go--"

she stopped and racked her brain.  who was left in town among their
friends who would be helpful?  there was mrs. elsing.  of course,
mrs. elsing didn't like her at all these days but she had always
been fond of melanie.

"go to mrs. elsing's, and explain everything very carefully and
tell her to please come up here.  and, prissy, listen to me.  miss
melly's baby is due and she may need you any minute now.  now you
hurry right straight back."

"yas'm," said prissy and, turning, sauntered down the walk at
snail's gait.

"hurry, you slow poke!"

"yas'm."

prissy quickened her gait infinitesimally and scarlett went back
into the house.  she hesitated again before going upstairs to
melanie.  she would have to explain to her just why mrs. meade
couldn't come and the knowledge that phil meade was badly wounded
might upset her

ddenly disappeared as pain contorted her
face.

scarlett looked down at melanie's tiny hips with none too sanguine
hopes but said reassuringly:  "oh, it's not really so bad."

"oh, i know it isn't.  i'm afraid i'm a little coward.  is--is mrs.
elsing coming right away?"

"yes, right away," said scarlett.  "i'll go down and get some fresh
water and sponge you off.  it's so hot today."

she took as long a time as possible in getting the water, running
to the front door every two minutes to see if prissy were coming.
there was no sign of prissy so she went back upstairs, sponged
melanie's perspiring body and combed out her long dark hair.

when an hour had passed she heard scuffing negro feet coming down
the street, and looking out of the window, saw prissy returning
slowly, switching herself as before and tossing her head with as
many airy affectations as if she had a large and interested
audience.

"some day, i'm going to take a strap to that little wench," thought
scarlett savagely, hurrying

an apron because i want you to go over to
the hospital.  i'm going to give you a note to dr. meade, and if he
isn't there, give it to dr. jones or any of the other doctors.  and
if you don't hurry back this time, i'll skin you alive."

"yas'm."

"and ask any of the gentlemen for news of the fighting.  if they
don't know, go by the depot and ask the engineers who brought the
wounded in.  ask if they are fighting at jonesboro or near there."

"gawdlmighty, miss scarlett!" and sudden fright was in prissy's
black face.  "de yankees ain' at tara, is dey?"

"i don't know.  i'm telling you to ask for news."

"gawdlmighty, miss scarlett!  whut'll dey do ter maw?"

prissy began to bawl suddenly, loudly, the sound adding to
scarlett's own uneasiness.

"stop bawling!  miss melanie will hear you.  now go change your
apron, quick."

spurred to speed, prissy hurried toward the back of the house while
scarlett scratched a hasty note on the margin of gerald's last
letter to her--the only bit of paper in the
 
 ___________________________
 
 house.  as she folded
it, so that her note was uppermost, she caught gerald's words,
"your mother--typhoid--under no condition--to come home--"  she
almost sobbed.  if it wasn't for melanie, she'd start home, right
this minute, if she had to walk every step of the way.

prissy went off at a trot, the letter gripped in her hand, and
scarlett went back upstairs, trying to think of some plausible lie
to explain mrs. elsing's failure to appear.  but melanie asked no
questions.  she lay upon her back, her face tranquil and sweet, and
the sight of her quieted scarlett for a while.

she sat down and tried to talk of inconsequential things, but the
thoughts of tara and a possible defeat by the yankees prodded
cruelly.  she thought of ellen dying and of the yankees coming int
 
 ___________________________
 
ght.  it was bad luck to wish that
someone were dead, almost as bad luck as to curse someone.  curses
came home to roost, mammy said.  she hastily prayed that melanie
wouldn't die and broke into feverish small talk, hardly aware of
what she said.  at last, melanie put a hot hand on her wrist.

"don't bother about talking, dear.  i know how worried you are.
i'm so sorry i'm so much trouble."

scarlett relapsed into silence but she could not sit still.  what
would she do if neither the doctor nor prissy got there in time?
she walked to the window and looked down the street and came back
and sat down again.  then she rose and looked out of the window on

an hour went by and then another.  noon came and the sun was high
and hot and not a breath of air stirred the dusty leaves.
melanie's pains were harder now.  her long hair was drenched in
sweat and her gown stuck in wet spots to her body.  scarlett
sponged her face in silence but fear was gnawing at her.  god in

en, suppose the baby came before the doctor arrived!  what
would she do?  she knew less than nothing of midwifery.  this was
exactly the emergency she had been dreading for weeks.  she had
been counting on prissy to handle the situation if no doctor should
be available.  prissy knew all about midwifery.  she'd said so time
and again.  but where was prissy?  why didn't she come?  why didn't
the doctor come?  she went to the window and looked again.  she
listened hard and suddenly she wondered if it were only her
imagination or if the sound of cannon in the distance had died
away.  if it were farther away it would mean that the fighting was
nearer jonesboro and that would mean--

at last she saw prissy coming down the street at a quick trot and
she leaned out of the window.  prissy, looking up, saw her and her
mouth opened to yell.  seeing the pan

ic written on the little black
face and fearing she might alarm melanie by crying out evil
tidings, scarlett hastily put her finger to her lips and left the
window.

"i'll get some cooler water," she said, looking down into melanie's
dark, deep-circled eyes and trying to smile.  then she hastily left
the room, closing the door carefully behind her.

prissy was sitting on the bottom step in the hall, panting.

"dey's fightin' at jonesboro, miss scarlett!  dey say our gempmums

scarlett clapped a hand over the blubbery mouth.

yes, what would happen to them if the yankees came--what would
happen to tara?  she pushed the thought firmly back into her mind

appled with the more pressing emergency.  if she thought of
these things, she'd begin to scream and bawl like prissy.

"where's dr. meade?  when's he coming?"

"ah ain' nebber seed him, miss scarlett."

"what!"

"going off and leaving us to the yankees?"

"i'm afraid so."

the spurred horse went off as though on springs and scarlett was
left standing in the middle of the street with the red dust thick
upon her ankles.

the yankees were coming.  the army was leaving.  the yankees were
coming.  what should she do?  where should she run?  no, she
couldn't run.  there was melanie back there in the bed expecting
that baby.  oh, why did women have babies?  if it wasn't for
melanie she could take wade and prissy and hide in the woods where
the yankees could never find them.  but she couldn't take melanie
to the woods.  no, not now.  oh, if she'd only had the baby sooner,
yesterday even, perhaps they could get an ambulance and take her
away and hide her somewhere.  but now--she must find dr. meade and
make him come home with her.  perhaps he could hurry the baby.

she gathered up her skirts and ran down the street, and the rhythm
of her feet was "the yankees are coming!  the yankees are coming!"

he turned as an orderly touched his arm and began firing directions
and pointing to this and that wounded man.  the man at her feet
looked up at scarlett compassionately.  she turned away, for the
doctor had forgotten her.

she picked her way rapidly through the wounded and back to
peachtree street.  the doctor wasn't coming.  she would have to see
it through herself.  thank god, prissy knew all about midwifery.
her head ached from the heat and she could feel her basque, soaking
wet from perspiration, sticking to her.  her mind felt numb and so
did her legs, numb as in a nightmare when she tried to run and
could not move them.  she thought of the long walk back to the
house and it seemed interminable.

then, "the yankees are coming!" began to beat its refrain in her
mind again.  her heart began to pound and new life came into her
limbs.  she hurried into the crowd at five poin

he rose dizzily to her feet and started walking again.  when she
came in sight of the house, she saw wade swinging on the front
gate.  when he saw her, his face puckered and he began to cry,
holding up a grubby bruised finger.

"hurt!" he sobbed.  "hurt!"

"hush!  hush!  hush!  or i'll spank you.  go out in the back yard
and make mud pies and don't move from there."

"wade hungwy," he sobbed and put the hurt finger in his mouth.

"i don't care.  go in the back yard and--"

she looked up and saw prissy leaning out of the upstairs window,
fright and worry written on her face; but in an instant they were
wiped away in relief as she saw her mistress.  scarlett beckoned to
her to come down and went into the house.  how cool it was in the
hall.  she untied her bonnet and flung it on the table, drawing her
forearms across her wet forehead.  she heard the upstairs door open
and a low wailing moan, wrenched from the depths of agony, came to
her ears.  prissy came down the stairs three at a time.

"is

"no.  he can't come."

"gawd, miss scarlett!  miss melly bad off!"

"the doctor can't come.  nobody can come.  you've got to bring the
baby and i'll help you."

prissy's mouth fell open and her tongue wagged wordlessly.  she
looked at scarlett sideways and scuffed her feet and twisted her
thin body.

"don't look so simple minded!" cried scarlett, infuriated at her
silly expression.  "what's the matter?"

prissy edged back up the stairs.

"fo' gawd, miss scarlett--"  fright and shame were in her rolling
eyes.

"well?"

"fo' gawd, miss scarlett!  we's got ter have a doctah.  ah--ah--
miss scarlett, ah doan know nuthin' 'bout bringin' babies.  maw
wouldn' nebber lemme be 'round folkses whut wuz havin' dem."

all the breath went out of scarlett's lungs in one gasp of horror
before rage swept her.  prissy made a lunge past her, bent on
flight, but scarlett grabbed her.

"you black liar--what do you mean?

everything about birthing babies.  what is the truth?  tell me!"
she shook her until the kinky head rocked drunkenly.

"ah's lyin', miss scarlett!  ah doan know huccome ah tell sech a
lie.  ah jes' see one baby birthed, an' maw she lak ter wo' me out

scarlett glared at her and prissy shrank back, trying to pull
loose.  for a moment her mind refused to accept the truth, but when
realization finally came to her that prissy knew no more about
midwifery than she did, anger went over her like a flame.  she had
never struck a slave in all her life, but now she slapped the black
cheek with all the force in her tired arm.  prissy screamed at the
top of her voice, more from fright than pain, and began to dance up
and down, writhing to break scarlett's grip.

as she screamed, the moaning from the second floor ceased and a
moment later melanie's voice, weak and trembling, called:
"scarlett?  is it you?  please come!  plea

scarlett dropped prissy's arm and the wench sank whimpering to the
steps.  for a moment scarlett stood still, looking up, listening to
the low moaning which had begun again.  as she stood there, it
seemed as though a yoke descended heavily upon her neck, felt as
though a heavy load were harnessed to it, a load she would feel as
soon as she took a step.

she tried to think of all the things mammy and ellen had done for
her when wade was born but the merciful blurring of the childbirth
pains obscured almost everything i

n mist.  she did recall a few
things and she spoke to prissy rapidly, authority in her voice.

"build a fire in the stove and keep hot water boiling in the
kettle.  and bring up all the towels you can find and that ball of
twine.  and get me the scissors.  don't come telling me you can't
find them.  get them and get them quick.  now hurry."

she jerked prissy to her feet and sent her kitchenwards with a
shove.  then she squared her shoulders and started up the stairs.
it was going to be difficult, telling melanie that she and prissy
were to deliver her baby.

there would never again be an afternoon as long as this one.  or as
hot.  or as full of lazy insolent flies.  they swarmed on melanie
despite the fan scarlett kept in constant motion.  her arms ached
from swinging the wide palmetto leaf.  all her efforts seemed
futile, for whil

crawled on her clammy feet and legs and made her jerk them weakly
and cry:  "please!  on my feet!"

the room was in semigloom, for scarlett had pulled down the shades
to shut out the heat and brightness.  pin points of sunlight came
in through minute holes in the shades and about the edges.  the
room was an oven and scarlett's sweat-drenched clothes never dried
but became wetter and stickier as the hours went by.  prissy was
crouched in a corner, sweating too, and smelled so abominably
scarlett would have sent her from the room had she not feared the
girl would take to her heels if once out of sight.  melanie lay on
the bed on a sheet dark with perspiration and splotched with
dampness where scarlett had spilled water.  she twisted endlessly,
to one side, to the other, to left, to right and back again.

sometimes she tried to sit up and fell back and began twisting
again.  at first, she had tried to keep from cr

morning.  she felt as if she had been in this steaming, dark,
sweating place all her life.  she wanted very much to scream every
time melanie did, and only by biting her lips so hard it infuriated
her could she restrain herself and drive off hysteria.

once wade came tiptoeing up the stairs and stood outside the door,
wailing.

"wade hungwy!"  scarlett started to go to him, but melanie
whispered:  "don't leave me.  please.  i can stand it when you're
here."

so scarlett sent prissy down to warm up the breakfast hominy and
feed him.  for herself, she felt that she could never eat again
after this afternoon.

the clock on the mantel had stopped and she had no way of telling
the time but as the heat in the room lessened and the bright pin
points of light grew duller, she pulled the shade aside.  she saw
to her surprise that it was late afternoon and the sun, a ball of
crimson, was far down the sky.  somehow, she had imagined it would
remain broiling hot noon forever.

moved out yet?  had the yankees come?  would the confederates
march away without even a fight?  then she remembered with a sick
dropping in her stomach how few confederates there were and how many
men sherman had and how well fed they were.  sherman!  the name of
satan himself did not frighten her half so much.  but there was no
time for thinking now, as melanie called for water, for a cold towel
on her head, to be fanned, to have the flies brushed away from her
face.

when twilight came on and prissy, scurrying like a black wraith,
lit a lamp, melanie became weaker.  she began calling for ashley,
over and over, as if in a delirium until the hideous monotony gave
scarlett a fierce desire to smother her voice with a pillow.
perhaps the doctor would come after all.  if he would only come
quickly!  hope raising its head, she turned to prissy, and ordered
her to run quickly to the meades' house and see if he were there or
mrs. meade.

"and if he's not there, ask mrs. meade or cookie what to do.

them to come!"

prissy was off with a clatter and scarlett watched her hurrying
down the street, going faster than she had ever dreamed the
worthless child could move.  after a prolonged time she was back,
alone.

"de doctah ain' been home all day.  sont wud he mout go off wid de

"dead?"

"yas'm," said prissy, expanding with importance.  "talbot, dey

scarlett wanted to slap her again for this helpful information but
melanie opened wide, dilated eyes and whispered:  "dear--are the
yankees coming?"

"no," said scarlett stoutl

in the pillow.  her voice came out muffled.

"my poor baby.  my poor baby."  and, after a long interval:  "oh,
scarlett, you mustn't stay here.  you must go and take wade."

what melanie said was no more than scarlett had been thinking but
hearing it put into words infuriated her, shamed her as if her
secret cowardice was written plainly in her face.

"don't be a goose.  i'm not afraid.  you know i won't leave

 and strain, and she shivered
with cold from the clammy sweat that soaked her body.  feebly she
made her way onto the front porch and sank down on the top step.
she sprawled back against a pillar of the porch and with a shaking
hand unbuttoned her basque halfway down her bosom.  the night was
drenched in warm soft darkness and she lay staring into it, dull as
an ox.

it was all over.  melanie was not dead and the small baby boy who
made noises like a young kitten was receiving his first bath at
prissy's hands.  melanie was asleep.  how could she sleep after
that nightmare of screaming pain and ignorant midwifery that hurt
more than it helped?  why wasn't she dead?  scarlett knew that she
herself would have died under such handling.  but when it was over,
melanie had even whispered, so weakly she had to bend over her to
hear:  "thank you."  and then she had gone to sleep.  how could she
go to sleep?  scarlett forgot that she too had gone to sleep after
wade was born.  she forgot everything.

ghs.  she was
warm and cold and sticky all at the same time and the feel of the
night air on her limbs was refreshing.  she thought dully what aunt
pitty would say, if she could see her sprawled here on the front
porch with her skirts up and her drawers showing, but she did not
care.  she did not care about anything.  time had stood still.  it
might be just after twilight and it might be midnight.  she didn't
know or care.

she heard sounds of moving feet upstairs and thought "may the lord
damn prissy," before her eyes closed and something like sleep
descended upon her.  then after an indeterminate dark interval,
prissy was beside her, chattering on in a pleased way.

"we done right good, miss scarlett.  ah specs maw couldn' a did no
better."

from the shadows, scarlett glared at her, too tired to rail, too
tired to upbraid, too tired to enumerate prissy's offenses--her
boastful assumption of experience she didn't possess, her fright,
her blundering awkwardness, her utter inefficiency when t

emergency was hot, the misplacing of the scissors, the spilling of
the basin of water on the bed, the dropping of the new born baby.
and now she bragged about how good she had been.

and the yankees wanted to free the negroes!  well, the yankees were
welcome to them.

she lay back against the pillar in silence and prissy, aware of her
mood, tiptoed away into the darkness of the porch.  after a long
interval in which her breathing finally quieted and her mind
steadied, scarlett heard the sound of faint voices from up the
road, the tramping of many feet coming from the north.  soldiers!
she sat up slowly, pulling down her skirts, although she knew no
one could see her in the darkness.  as they came abreast the house,
an indeterminate number, passing like shadows, she called to them.

"oh, please!"

eating?"

"yes, ma'm.  you see, the yankees are coming."

the yankees are coming!  she had forgotten that.  her throat
suddenly contracted and she could say nothing more.  the shadow
moved away, merged itself with the other shadows and the feet
tramped off into the darkness.  "the yankees are coming!  the
yankees are coming!"  that was what the rhythm of their feet said,
that was what her suddenly bumping heart thudded out with each
beat.  the yankees are coming!

"de yankees is comin'!" bawled prissy, shrinking close to her.
"oh, miss scarlett, dey'll kill us all!  dey'll run dey baynits in
our stummicks!  dey'll--"

"oh, hush!"  it was terrifying enough to think these things without
hearing them put into trembling words.  renewed fear swept her.
what could she do?  how could she escape?  where could she turn for
help?  every friend had failed her.

suddenly she thought of rhett butler and calm dispelled her fears.
why hadn't she thought of him this morning when she had been

ike a chicken with its head off?  she hated him, but
he was strong and smart and he wasn't afraid of the yankees.  and
he was still in town.  of course, she was mad at him.  but she
could overlook such things at a time like this.  and he had a horse
and carriage, too.  oh, why hadn't she thought of him before!  he
could take them all away from this doomed place, away from the
yankees, somewhere, anywhere.

she turned to prissy and spoke with feverish urgency.

"you know where captain butler lives--at the atlanta hotel?"

"yas'm, but--"

"well, go there, now, as quick as you can run and tell him i want
him.  i want him to come quickly and bring his horse and carriage
or an ambulance if he can get one.  tell him about the baby.  tell
him i want him to take us out of here.  go, now.  hurry!"

she sat upright and gave prissy a push to speed her feet.

"miss scarlett, maw would weah me out wid a cotton stalk, did ah go

scarlett pulled herself to her feet.

"well, i'll wear you out if you don't.  you can stand outside in
the street and yell for him, can't you?  or ask somebody if he's
inside.  get going."

when prissy still lingered, shuffling her feet and mouthing,
scarlett gave her another push which nearly sent her headlong down
the front steps.

"you'll go or i'll sell you down the river.  you'll never see your
mother again or anybody you know and i'll sell you for a field hand
too.  hurry!"

"gawdlmighty, miss scarlett--"

but under the determined pressure of her mistress' hand she started
down the steps.  the front gate clicked and scarlett cried:  "run,

after prissy had gone, scarlett went wearily into the downstairs
hall and lit a lamp.  the house felt steamingly hot, as though it
held in its walls all the heat of the noontide.  some of her
dullness was passing now and her stomach was clamoring for food.
she remembered she had had nothing to eat since the night before
except a spoonful of hominy, and picking up the lamp she went into
the kitchen.  the fire in the oven had died but the room was
stifling hot.  she found half a pone of hard corn bread in the

from the next room but she paid it no heed.  she had no
time for melanie now.  no time for anything except a fear that
licked through her veins as swiftly as the flames she saw.  she was
a child and mad with fright and she wanted to bury her head in her
mother's lap and shut out this sight.  if she were only home!  home
with mother.

through the nerve-shivering sounds, she heard another sound, that
of fear-sped feet coming up the stairs three at a time, heard a
voice yelping like a lost hound.  prissy broke into the room and,
flying to scarlett, clutched her arm in a grip that seemed to pinch
out pieces of flesh.

"the yankees--" cried scarlett.

"no'm, its our gempmums!" yelled prissy between breaths, digging
her nails deeper into scarlett's arm.  "dey's buhnin' de foun'ry

she rallied her frightened forces together.

"if i don't get a hold on myself," she thought, "i'll be squalling
like a scalded cat!" and the sight of prissy's abject terror helped
steady her.  she took her by the shoulders and shook her.

"shut up that racket and talk sense.  the yankees haven't come, you
fool!  did you see captain butler?  what did he say?  is he
coming?"

prissy ceased her yelling but her teeth chattered.

"yas'm, ah finely foun' him.  in a bahroom, lak you told me.  he--"

"never mind where you found him.  is he coming?  did you tell him
to bring his horse?"

scarlett's heart went leaden as the last hope left her.  fool that
she was, why hadn't she thought that the retreating army would
naturally take every vehicle and animal left in the city?  for a
moment she was too stunned to hear what prissy was saying but she
pulled herself together to hear the rest of the story.

practical.

"wake wade up and dress him and pack some clothes for all of us.

prissy still clung to her skirts and hardly anything showed in her
eyes except the whites.  scarlett gave her a shove and loosened her
grip.

"hurry," she cried, and prissy went off like a rabbit.

scarlett knew she should go in and quiet melanie's fear, knew
melanie must be frightened out of her senses by the thunderous
noises that continued unabated and the glare that lighted the sky.
it looked and sounded like the end of the world.

ina and the little silver she had left when she
refugeed to macon.  but when she reached the dining room, her hands
were shaking so badly she dropped three plates and shattered them.
she ran out onto the porch to listen and back again to the dining
room and dropped the silver clattering to the floor.  everything
she touched she dropped.  in her hurry she slipped on the rag rug
and fell to the floor with a jolt but leaped up so quickly she was
not even aware of the pain.  upstairs she could hear prissy
galloping about like a wild animal and the sound maddened her, for
she was galloping just as aimlessly.

for the dozenth time, she ran out onto the porch but this time she
did not go back to her futile packing.  she sat down.  it was just
impossible to pack anything.  impossible to do anything but sit
with hammering heart and wait for rhett.  it seemed hours before he
came.  at last, far up the road, she heard the protesting screech
of unoiled axles and the slow uncertain plodding of hooves.  w

glared at him, hating him.

"i'm not afraid," she said.

"yes, you are.  in another moment you'll be in a swoon and i have
no smelling salts about me."

she stamped her foot impotently because she could not think of
anything else to do--and without a word picked up the lamp and
started up the stairs.  he was close behind her and she could hear
him laughing softly to himself.  that sound stiffened her spine.
she went into wade's nursery and found him sitting clutched in
prissy's arms, half dressed, hiccoughing quietly.  prissy was
whimpering.  the feather tick on wade's bed was small and she
ordered prissy to drag it down the stairs and into the wagon.
prissy put down the child and obeyed.  wade followed her down the
stairs, his hiccoughs stilled by his interest in the proceedings.

"come," said scarlett, turning to melanie's door and rhett followed
her, hat in hand.

melanie lay quietly with the sheet up to her chin.  her face was
deathly white but her eyes, sunken

s large brown eyes met hers and she stopped for a
moment to look at the picture curiously.  this man had been her
husband, had lain beside her for a few nights, had given her a
child with eyes as soft and brown as his.  and she could hardly
remember him.

the child in her arms waved small fists and mewed softly and she
looked down at him.  for the first time, she realized that this was
ashley's baby and suddenly wished with all the strength left in her
that he were her baby, hers and ashley's.

prissy came bounding up the stairs and scarlett handed the child to
her.  they went hastily down, the lamp throwing uncertain shadows
on the wall.  in the hall, scarlett saw a bonnet and put it on
hurriedly, tying the ribbons under her chin.  it was melanie's
black mourning bonnet and it did not fit scarlett's head but she
could not recall where she had put her own bonnet.

she went out of the house and down the front steps, carrying the
lamp and trying to keep the saber from banging against her legs.

melanie lay full length in the back of the wagon, and, beside her,
were wade and the towel-swathed baby.  prissy climbed in and took
the baby in her arms.

the wagon was very small and the boards about the sides very low.
the wheels leaned inward as if their first revolution would make
them come off.  she took one look at the horse and her heart sank.
he was a small emaciated animal and he stood with his head
dispiritedly low, almost between his forelegs.  his back was raw
with sores and harness galls and he breathed as no sound horse
should.

"not much of an animal, is it?" grinned rhett.  "looks like he

"must--must we go through the fire?" scarlett quavered.

"not if we hurry," said rhett and, springing from the wagon, he
disappeared into the darkness of a yard.  when he returned he had a
small limb of a tree in his hand and he laid it mercilessly across
the horse's galled back.  the animal broke into a shambling trot,
his breath panting and labored, and the wagon swayed forward with a
jolt that threw them about like popcorn in a popper.  the baby
wailed, and prissy and wade cried out as they bruised themselves
against the sides of the wagon.  but from melanie there was no
sound.

as they neared marietta street, the trees thinned out and the tall
flames roaring up above the buildings threw street and houses into
a glare of light brighter than day, casting monstrous shadows that
twisted as wildly as torn sails flapping in a gale on a sinking
ship.

scarlett's teeth chattered but so great was her terror she was not
even aware of it.  she was cold and she shi

the bearded man said nothing and plodded on out of sight around the
bend of the road.

rhett sat still, the reins lax in his hands, looking after them, a
curious moody look on his swarthy face.  then, there was a crash of
falling timbers near by and scarlett saw a thin tongue of flame
lick up over the roof of the warehouse in whose sheltering shadow
they sat.  then pennons and battle flags of flame flared
triumphantly to the sky above them.  smoke burnt her nostrils and
wade and prissy began coughing.  the baby made soft sneezing
sounds.

"oh, name of god, rhett!  are you crazy?  hurry!  hurry!"

rhett made no reply but brought the tree limb down on the horse's
back with a cruel force that made the animal leap forward.  with
all the speed the horse could summon, they jolted and bounced
across marietta street.  ahead of them was a tunnel of fire where
buildings were blazing on either side of the short, narrow street
that led down to the railroad tracks.  they plunged into it. 
 
 ___________________________
 
oh, rhett," she whispered clasping his arm, "what would we ever
have done without you?  i'm so glad you aren't in the army!"

he turned his head and gave her one look, a look that made her drop
his arm and shrink back.  there was no mockery in his eyes now.
they were naked and there was anger and something like bewilderment
in them.  his lip curled down and he turned his head away.  for a
long time they jounced along in a silence unbroken except for the
faint wails of the baby and sniffles from prissy.  when she was
able to bear the sniffling noise no longer, scarlett turned and
pinched her viciously, causing prissy to scream in good earnest
before she relapsed into frightened silence.

finally rhett turned the horse at right angles and after a while
they were on a wider, smoother road.  the dim shapes of houses grew
farther and farther apart and unbroken woods loomed wall-like on
either side.

"we're out of town now," said rhett briefly, drawing rein, "and on
the main road to rough and read

on the altar of my country, i hope your conscience hurts you."

she heard him laugh as he turned away and walked back toward the
wagon.  she saw him stand beside it, heard him speak and his voice
was changed, courteous and respectful as it always was when he
spoke to melanie.

"mrs. wilkes?"

prissy's frightened voice made answer from the wagon.

"gawdlmighty, cap'n butler!  miss melly done fainted away back
yonder."

"she's not dead?  is she breathing?"

"yassuh, she breathin'."

"then she's probably better off as she is.  if she were conscious,
i doubt if she could live through all the pain.  take good care of
her, prissy.  here's a shinplaster for you.  try not to be a bigger
fool than you are."

"yassuh.  thankee suh."

"good-by, scarlett."

orning sunlight streaming through the trees
overhead awakened scarlett.  for a moment, stiffened by the cramped
position in which she had slept, she could not remember where she
was.  the sun blinded her, the hard boards of the wagon under her
were harsh against her body, and a heavy weight lay across her
legs.  she tried to sit up and discovered that the weight was wade
who lay sleeping with his head pillowed on her knees.  melanie's
bare feet were almost in her face and, under the wagon seat, prissy
was curled up like a black cat with the small baby wedged in
between her and wade.

then she remembered everything.  she popped up to a sitting
position and looked hastily all around.  thank god, no yankees in
sight!  their hiding place had not been discovered in the night.
it all came back to her now, the nightmare journey after rhett's
footsteps died away, the endless night, the black road full of ruts
and boulders along which they jolted, the deep gullies on either
side into which the wagon

slipped, the fear-crazed strength with
which she and prissy had pushed the wheels out of the gullies.  she
recalled with a shudder how often she had driven the unwilling
horse into fields and woods when she heard soldiers approaching,
not knowing if they were friends or foes--recalled, too, her
anguish lest a cough, a sneeze or wade's hiccoughing might betray
them to the marching men.

oh, that dark road where men went by like ghosts, voices stilled,
only the muffled tramping of feet on soft dirt, the faint clicking
of bridles and the straining creak of

when, at last, they had neared rough and ready, a few camp fires
were gleaming where the last of steve lee's rear guard was awaiting
orders to fall back.  she had circled through a plowed field for a
mile until the light of the fires died out behind her.  and then
she had lost her way in the darkness and sobbed when she could not
find the little wagon path she knew so well.  then finally having
found it, the horse sank in the traces and refused to move, refused
to rise even when she and prissy tugged at the bridle.

so she had unharnessed him and crawled, sodden with fatigue, into
the back of the wagon and stretched her aching legs.  she had a
faint memory of melanie's voice before sleep clamped down her
eyelids, a weak voice that apologized even as it begged:  "scarlett,
can i have some water, please?"

she had said:  "there isn't any," and gone to sleep before the
words were out of her mouth.

now it was morning and the world was still and serene and green and

she drew a deep shuddering breath.  would she find tara like this,
level with the ground, silent as the dead?

"i mustn't think about that now," she told herself hurriedly.  "i
mustn't let myself think about it.  i'll get scared again if i
think about it."  but, in spite of herself, her heart quickened and
each beat seemed to thunder:  "home!  hurry!  home!  hurry!"

they must be starting on toward home again.  but first they must
find some food and water, especially water.  she prodded prissy
awake.  prissy rolled her eyes as she looked about her.

"fo' gawd, miss scarlett, ah din' spec ter wake up agin 'cept in de
promise lan'."

"you're a long way from there," said scarlett, trying to smooth
back her untidy hair.  her face was damp and her body was already
wet with sweat.  she felt dirty and messy and sticky, almost as if
she smelled bad.  her clothes were crushed and wrinkled from
sleeping in them and she had never felt more acutely tired and sore
in all her life.  muscles she di

she looked down at melanie and saw that her dark eyes were opened.
they were sick eyes, fever bright, and dark baggy circles were
beneath them.  she opened cracking lips and whispered appealingly:
"water."

"get up, prissy," ordered scarlett.  "we'll go to the well and get
some water."

"but, miss scarlett!  dey mout be hants up dar.  sposin' somebody
daid up dar?"

"i'll make a hant out of you if you don't get out of this wagon,"
said scarlett, who was in no mood for argument, as she climbed
lamely down to the ground.

and then she thought of the horse.  name of god!  suppose the horse
had died in the night!  he had seemed ready to die when she
unharnessed him.  she ran around the wagon and saw him lying on his

side.  if he were dead, she would curse god and die too.  somebody
in the bible had done just that thing.  cursed god and died.  she
knew just how that person felt.  but the horse was alive--breathing
heavily, sick eyes half closed, but alive.  well, some water would
help him too.

prissy climbed reluctantly from the wagon with many groans and
timorously followed scarlett up the avenue.  behind the ruins the
row of whitewashed slave quarters stood silent and deserted under
the overhanging trees.  between the quarters and the smoked stone
foundations, they found the well, and the roof of it still stood
with the bucket far down the well.  between them, they wound up the
rope, and when the bucket of cool sparkling water appeared out of
the dark depths, scarlett tilted it to her lip

sucking noises, spilling the water all over herself.

she drank until prissy's petulant:  "well, ah's thusty, too, miss
scarlett," made her recall the needs of the others.

"untie the knot and take the bucket to the wagon and give them
some.  and give the rest to the horse.  don't you think miss
melanie ought to nurse the baby?  he'll starve."

"law, miss scarlett, miss melly ain' got no milk--ain' gwine have

harnessed him.  when she slipped the bit into his mouth, she saw
that he was practically toothless.  as old as the hills!  while
rhett was stealing a horse, why couldn't he have stolen a good one?

she mounted the seat and brought down the hickory limb on his back.
he wheezed and started, but he walked so slowly as she turned him
into the road she knew she could walk faster herself with no effort
whatever.  oh, if only she didn't have melanie and wade and the
baby and prissy to bother with!  how swiftly she could walk home!
why, she would run home, run every step of the way that would bring
her closer to tara and to mother.

they couldn't be more than fifteen miles from home, but at the rate
this old nag traveled it would take all day, for she would have to
stop frequently to rest him.  all day!  she looked down the glaring
red road, cut in deep ruts where cannon wheels and ambulances had
gone over it.  it would be hours before she knew if tara still

she looked back at melanie who lay with sick eyes closed against
the sun and jerked loose the strings of her bonnet and tossed it to
prissy.

"put that over her face.  it'll keep the sun out of her eyes."
then as the heat beat down upon her unprotected head, she thought:
"i'll be as freckled as a guinea egg before this day is over."

she had never in her life been out in the sunshine without a hat or
veils, never handled reins without gloves to protect the white skin
of her dimpled hands.  yet here she was exposed to the sun in a
broken-down wagon with a broken-down horse, dirty, sweaty, hungry,
helpless to do anything but plod alo

 macintosh's house.  she peered through the
gathering dusk down the two lines of ancient trees.  all was dark.
not a single light showed in the house or in the quarters.
straining her eyes in the darkness she dimly discerned a sight
which had grown familiar through that terrible day--two tall
chimneys, like gigantic tombstones towering above the ruined second
floor, and broken unlit windows blotching the walls like still,
blind eyes.

"hello!" she shouted, summoning all her strength.  "hello!"

prissy clawed at her in a frenzy of fright and scarlett, turning,
saw that her eyes were rolling in her head.

"doan holler, miss scarlett!  please, doan holler agin!" she
whispered, her voice shaking.  "dey ain' no tellin' whut mout
answer!"

"dear god!" thought scarlett, a shiver running through her.  "dear
god!  she's right.  anything might come out of there!"

she flapped the reins and urged the horse forward.  the sight of
the macintosh house had pricked the last bubble of hope remaining
to her.

 her care.  "take care of her."  oh,
that beautiful, heartbreaking day when he had kissed her good-by
before he went away forever!  "you'll take care of her, won't you?
promise!"  and she had promised.  why had she ever bound herself
with such a promise, doubly binding now that ashley was gone?  even
in her exhaustion she hated melanie, hated the tiny mewing voice of
her child which, fainter and fainter, pierced the stillness.  but
she had promised and now they belonged to her, even as wade and
prissy belonged to her, and she must struggle and fight for them as
long as she had strength or breath.  she could have left them in
atlanta, dumped melanie into the hospital and deserted her.  but
had she done that, she could never face ashley, either on this
earth or in the hereafter and tell him she had left his wife and
child to die among strangers.

oh, ashley!  where was he tonight while she toiled down this
haunted road with his wife and baby?  was he alive and did he think

scarlett's taut nerves almost cracked as a sudden noise sounded in
the underbrush near them.  prissy screamed loudly, throwing herself
to the floor of the wagon, the baby beneath her.  melanie stirred
feebly, her hands seeking the baby, and wade covered his eyes and
cowered, too frightened to cry.  then the bushes beside them
crashed apart under heavy hooves and a low moaning bawl assaulted
their ears.

"it's only a cow," said scarlett, her voice rough with fright.
"don't be a fool, prissy.  you've mashed the baby and frightened
miss melly and wade."

"it's a ghos'," moaned prissy, writhing fa

turning deliberately, scarlett raised the tree limb she had been
using as a whip and brought it down across prissy's back.  she was
too exhausted and weak from fright to tolerate weakness in anyone
else.

"sit up, you fool," she said, "before i wear this out on you."

yelping, prissy raised her head and peering over the side of the
wagon saw it was, indeed, a cow, a red and white animal which stood
looking at them appealingly with large frightened eyes.  opening
its mouth, it lowed again as if in pain.

"is it hurt?  that doesn't sound like an ordinary moo."

"soun' ter me lak her bag full an' she need milkin' bad," said
prissy, regaining some measure of control.  "spec it one of mist'

the last boat he slipped through the blockade and she had worked a
week to make the garment.  resolutely she took it by the hem and
jerked, put it in her mouth and gnawed, until finally the material
gave with a rip and tore the length.  she gnawed furiously, tore
with both hands and the petticoat lay in strips in her hands.  she
knotted the ends with fingers that bled from blisters and shook
from fatigue.

"slip this over her horns," she directed.  but prissy balked.

"ah's sceered of cows, miss scarlett.  ah ain' nebber had nuthin'
ter do wid cows.  ah ain' no yard nigger.  ah's a house nigger."

"you're a fool nigger, and the worst day's work pa ever did was to
buy you," said scarlett slowly, too tired for anger.  "and if i
ever get the use of my arm again, i'll wear this whip out on you."

there, she thought, i've said "nigger" and mother wouldn't like
that at all.

prissy rolled her eyes wildly, peeping first at the set face of her

then at the cow which bawled plaintively.  scarlett
seemed the less dangerous of the two, so prissy clutched at the
sides of the wagon and remained where she was.

stiffly, scarlett climbed down from the seat, each movement of
agony of aching muscles.  prissy was not the only one who was
"sceered" of cows.  scarlett had always feared them, even the
mildest cow seemed sinister to her, but this was no time to truckle
to small fears when great ones crowded so thick upon her.
fortunately the cow was gentle.  in its pain it had sought human
companionship and help and it made no threatening gesture as she
looped one end of the torn petticoat about its horns.  she tied the
other end to the back of the wagon, as securely as her awkward
fingers would permit.
 
 ___________________________
 
scarlett's eyes grew misty when, at last, they reached the bottom
of a gentle incline, for just over the rise lay tara!  then her
heart sank.  the decrepit animal would never pull the hill.  the
slope had always seemed so slight, so gradual, in days when she
galloped up it on her fleet-footed mare.  it did not seem possible
it could have grown so steep since she saw it last.  the horse
would never make it with the heavy load.

wearily she dismounted and took the animal by the bridle.

"get out, prissy," she commanded, "and take wade.  either carry him
or make him walk.  lay the baby by miss melanie."

wade broke into sobs and whimperings from which scarlett could only
distinguish:  "dark--dark--wade fwightened!"

"miss scarlett, ah kain walk.  mah feets done blistered an' dey's
thoo mah shoes, an' wade an' me doan weigh so much an'--"

"get out!  get out before i pull you out!  and if i do, i'm going
to leave you right here, in the dark by yourself.  quick, now!"

prissy moaned, peering at t

ing close to his nurse.

"make him hush.  i can't stand it," said scarlett, taking the horse
by the bridle and pulling him to a reluctant start.  "be a little
man, wade, and stop crying or i will come over there and slap you."

why had god invented children, she thought savagely as she turned
her ankle cruelly on the dark road--useless, crying nuisances they
were, always demanding care, always in the way.  in her exhaustion,
there was no room for compassion for the frightened child, trotting
by prissy's side, dragging at her hand and sniffling--only a
weariness that she had borne him, only a tired wonder that she had
ever married charles hamilton.

"miss scarlett," whispered prissy, clutching her mistress' arm,
"doan le's go ter tara.  dey's not dar.  dey's all done gone.
maybe dey daid--maw an' all'm."

the echo of her own thoughts infuriated her and scarlett shook off
the pinching fingers.

"then give me wade's hand.  you can sit right down here and stay."

"no'm!  no'm!"

"then hush!"

"she must be carried.  she can't walk."

there was a scuffle of feet and a dark figure emerged from the cave
of the front hall.  pork ran down the steps.

"miss scarlett!  miss scarlett!" he cried.

scarlett caught him by the arms.  pork, part and parcel of tara, as
dear as the bricks and the cool corridors!  she felt his tears
stream down on her hands as he patted her clumsily, crying:  "sho
is glad you back!  sho is--"

prissy burst into tears and incoherent mumblings:  "poke!  poke,
honey!"  and little wade, encouraged by the weakness of his elders,
began sniffling:  "wade thirsty!"

scarlett caught them all in hand.

"miss melanie is in the wagon and her baby too.  pork, you must

he half-lifted, half-dragged her from the feather tick on which she
had lain so many hours.  and then she was in pork's strong arms,
her head drooping like a child's across his shoulder.  prissy,
holding the baby and dragging wade by the hand, followed them up
the wide steps and disappeared into the blackness of the hall.

scarlett's bleeding fingers sought her father's hand urgently.

"did they get well, pa?"

"the girls are recovering."

held close against her, melanie's baby pressed his pale rosebud
mouth greedily to the dark nipple, sucking, gripping tiny fists
against the soft flesh like a kitten in the warm fur of its
mother's belly.

scarlett rose unsteadily and put a hand on dilcey's arm.

"it was good of you to stay, dilcey."

"how could i go off wid them trashy niggers, miss scarlett, after

didn't never talk so short to nobody, not even when she caught them
stealing pullets and watermelons.  she asked again about the
fields, the gardens, the stock, and her green eyes had a hard
bright glaze which pork had never seen in them before.

pork said tactfully.  "an' ain' no use quarrelin' wid blessin's,

a small fiend with a pair of hot tweezers plucked behind scarlett's
eyeballs.

"you two will catch the sow--or get out of here, like the field
hands did."

tears trembled in pork's hurt eyes.  oh, if only miss ellen was
here!  she understood such niceties and realized the wide gap
between the duties of a field hand and those of a house nigger.

"who wid, chile?"

"by myself.  mammy must stay with the girls and mr. gerald can't--"

pork set up an outcry which she found infuriating.  there might be
yankees or mean niggers at twelve oaks.  she mustn't go alone.

"that will be enough, pork.  tell dilcey to start immediately.  and
you and prissy go bring in the sow and her litter," she said
briefly, turning on her heel.

mammy's old sunbonnet, faded but clean, hung on its peg on the back
porch and scarlett put it on her head, remembering, as from another
world, the bonnet with the curling green plume which rhett had
brought her from paris.  she picked up a large split-oak basket and
started down the back stairs, each step jouncing her head until her
spine seemed to be trying to crash through the top of her skull.

uick reprimands brought such acute fright
to his round eyes, for he looked so simple minded when he was
frightened.  she did not realize that the little boy lived shoulder
to shoulder with terror too great for an adult to comprehend.  fear
lived with wade, fear that shook his soul and made him wake
screaming in the night.  any unexpected noise or sharp word set him
to trembling, for in his mind noises and harsh words were
inextricably mixed with yankees and he was more afraid of yankees
than of prissy's hants.

until the thunders of the siege began, he had never known anything
but a happy, placid, quiet life.  even though his mother paid him
little attention, he had known nothing but petting and kind words
until the night when he was jerked from slumber to find the sky
aflame and the air deafening with explosions.  in that night and
the day which followed, he had been slapped by his mother for the
first time and had heard her voice raised at him in harsh words.

scarlett had not intended to do any cotton picking herself, even
after grandma fontaine's tart remark.  it was unthinkable that she,
an o'hara lady, now the mistress of tara, should work in the
fields.  it put her on the same level with the snarly haired mrs.
slattery and emmie.  she had intended that the negroes should do
the field work, while she and the convalescent girls attended to
the house, but here she was confronted with a caste feeling even
stronger than her own.  pork, mammy and prissy set up outcries at
the idea of working in the fields.  they reiterated that they were
house niggers, not field hands.  mammy, in particular, declared
vehemently that she had never even been a yard nigger.  she had
been born in the robillard great house, not in the quarters, and
had been raised in ole miss' bedroom, sleeping on a pallet at the
foot of the bed.  dilcey alone said nothing and she fixed her
prissy with an unwinking eye that made her squirm.

and earnestly.  but, after she had labored for an hour it was
obvious that she, and not suellen, was the one not yet well enough
for such work.  so scarlett sent carreen back to the house too.

there remained with her now in the long rows only dilcey and
prissy.  prissy picked lazily, spasmodically, complaining of her
feet, her back, her internal miseries, her complete weariness,
until her mother took a cotton stalk to her and whipped her until
she screamed.  after that she worked a little better, taking care
to stay far from her mother's reach.

and said with dignity:  "thankee, ma'm.  but mist' gerald and miss
ellen been good to me.  mist' gerald buy my prissy so i wouldn'
grieve and i doan forgit it.  i is part indian and indians doan
forgit them as is good to them.  i sorry 'bout my prissy.  she
mighty wuthless.  look lak she all nigger lak her pa.  her pa was
mighty flighty."

in spite of scarlett's problem of getting help from the others in
the picking and in spite of the weariness of doing the labor
herself, her spirits lifted as the cotton slowly made its way from
the fields to the cabins.  there was something about cotton that
was reassuring, steadying.  tara had risen to riches on cotton,
even as the whole south had risen, and scarlett was southerner
enough to believe that

startled faces to her, fearful her mind had cracked under the
tidings.  "i won't go hungry!  they shan't have them!"

"what is it, scarlett?  what is it?"

"the horse!  the cow!  the pigs!  they shan't have them!  i won't
let them have them!"

she turned swiftly to the four negroes who huddled in the doorway,
their black faces a peculiarly ashen shade.

"the swamp," she said rapidly.

"whut swamp?"

"the river swamp, you fools!  take the pigs to the swamp.  all of
you.  quickly.  pork, you and prissy crawl under the house and get
the pigs out.  suellen, you and carreen fill the baskets with as
much food as you can carry and get to the woods.  mammy, put the
silver in the well again.  and pork!  pork, listen to me, don't
stand there like that!  take pa with you.  don't ask me where!
anywhere!  go with pork, pa.  that's a sweet pa."

even in her frenzy she thought what the sight of bluecoats might do
to gerald's wavering mind.  she stopped and wrung her hands and the
frightened sobbing of lit

she heard suellen crying:  "come on, carreen!  come on!  we've got
enough.  oh, sister, hurry!"  there were wild squealings, indignant
gruntings in the back yard and, running to the widow, scarlett saw
mammy waddling hurriedly across the cotton field with a struggling
young pig under each arm.  behind her was pork also carrying two
pigs and pushing gerald before him.  gerald was stumping across the
furrows, waving his cane.

leaning out of the window scarlett yelled:  "get the sow, dilcey!
make prissy drive her out.  you can chase her across the fields!"

dilcey looked up, her bronzed face harassed.  in her apron was a
pile of silver tableware.  she pointed under the house.

"the sow done bit prissy and got her penned up unner the house."

"good for the sow," thought scarlett.  she hurried back into her
room and hastily gathered from their hiding place the bracelets,
brooch, miniature and cup she had found on the dead yankee.  but
where to hide them?  it was awkward, carrying little beau in

upstairs she could hear heavy boots trampling, the protesting
screech of furniture pulled across the floor, the crashing of china
and mirrors, the curses when nothing of value appeared.  from the
yard came loud cries:  "head um off!  don't let um get away!" and
the despairing squawks of the hens and quacking and honking of the
ducks and geese.  a pang went through her as she heard an agonized
squealing which was suddenly stilled by a pistol shot and she knew
that the sow was dead.  damn prissy!  she had run off and left her.
if only the shoats were safe!  if only the family had gotten safely
to the swamp!  but there was no way of knowing.

she stood quietly in the hall while the soldiers boiled about her,
shouting and cursing.  wade's fingers were in her skirt in a
terrified grip.  she could feel his body shaking as he pressed
against her but she could not bring herself to speak reassuringly
to him.  she could not bring herself to utter any word to the
yankees, either of pleading, pr

ers limp by in rags with their feet tied up
in sacks and strips of carpet, but not ashley.  he should come home
on a prancing horse, dressed in fine clothes and shining boots, a
plume in his hat.  it was the final degradation for her to think of
ashley reduced to the state of these other soldiers.

one afternoon in june when everyone at tara was assembled on the
back porch eagerly watching pork cut the first half-ripe watermelon
of the season, they heard hooves on the gravel of the front drive.
prissy started languidly toward the front door, while those left
behind argued hotly as to whether they should hide the melon or
keep it for supper, should the caller at the door prove to be a
soldier.

melly and carreen whispered that the soldier guest should have a
share and scarlett, backed by suellen and mammy, hissed to pork to
hide it quickly.

"don't be a goose, girls!  there's not enough for us as it is and
if there are two or three famished soldiers out there, none of us
will even get a taste

," said scarlett.

while pork stood with the little melon clutched to him, uncertain
as to the final decision, they heard prissy cry out.

"gawdlmighty!  miss scarlett!  miss melly!  come quick!"

"who is it?" cried scarlett, leaping up from the steps and racing
through the hall with melly at her shoulder and the others
streaming after her.

ashley! she thought.  oh, perhaps--

"it's uncle peter!  miss pittypat's uncle peter!"

they all ran out to the front porch and saw the tall grizzled old
despot of aunt pitty's house climbing down from a rat-tailed nag on
which a section of quilting had been strapped.  on his wide bl

"but i'll be at aunt pittypat's," scarlett offered frantically.

"miss pittypat a fine woman an' she think she see eve'ything but
she doan," said mammy, and turning with the majestic air of having
closed the interview, she went into the hall.  the boards trembled
as she called:

"prissy, child!  fly up de stairs an' fotch miss scarlett's pattun
box frum de attic an' try an' fine de scissors without takin' all
night 'bout it."

"this is a fine mess," thought scarlett dejectedly.  "i'd as soon
have a bloodhound after me."

after supper had been cleared away, scarlett and mammy spread
patterns on the dining-room table while suellen and carreen busily
ripped satin linings from curtains and melanie brushed the velvet
with a clean hairbrush to remove the dust.  gerald, will and ashl

however, i admired him and tried to copy him far more than i ever
did my father, for father is an amiable gentleman full of honorable

your children will probably be soft, prissy creatures, as the
children of hard-bitten characters usually are.  and to make them
worse, you, like every other mother, are probably determined that
they shall never know the hardships you've known.  and that's all
wrong.  hardships make or break people.  so you'll have to wait for
approval from your grandchildren."

"scarlett, i will come to atlanta. . . .  i cannot fight you both."

he turned and walked out of the room.  some of the triumph in her
heart was dulled by a nagging fear.  the look in his eyes when he
spoke had been the same as when he said he would be lost forever if
he came to atlanta.



after suellen and will married and carreen went off to charleston
to the convent, ashley, melanie and beau came to atlanta, bringing
dilcey with them to cook and nurse.  prissy and pork were left at
tara until such a time as will could get other darkies to help him
in the fields and then they, too, would come to town.

the little brick house that ashley took for his family was on ivy
street directly behind aunt pitty's house and the two back yards
ran together, divided only by a ragged overgrown privet hedge.
melanie had chosen it especially for this reason.  she said, on the
first morning of her return to atlanta as she laughed and cried and
embraced scarlett and aun

alarmed or distressed that sam had committed murder, but she was
disappointed that she could not have him as a driver.  a big negro
like sam would be as good a bodyguard as archie.  well, she must
get him safe to tara somehow, for of course the authorities must
not get him.  he was too valuable a darky to be hanged.  why, he
was the best foreman tara had ever had!  it did not enter
scarlett's mind that he was free.  he still belonged to her, like
pork and mammy and peter and cookie and prissy.  he was still "one
of our family" and, as such, must be protected.

"i'll send you to tara tonight," she said finally.  "now sam, i've
got to drive out the road a piece, but i ought to be back here
before sundown.  you be waiting here for me when i come back.
don't tell anyone where you are going and if you've got a hat,
