[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER] is a sensible prepubescent girl from a wealthy english
family who finds herself in a strange world ruled by imagination
and fantasy. [CHARACTER] feels comfortable with her identity and has a
strong sense that her environment is comprised of clear, logical,
and consistent rules and features. [CHARACTER]'s familiarity with the
world has led one critic to describe her as a "disembodied intellect."
[CHARACTER] displays great curiosity and attempts to fit her diverse experiences
into a clear understanding of the world.

[CHARACTER] approaches wonderland as an anthropologist, but
maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her
class status. she has confidence in her social position, education,
and the victorian virtue of good manners. [CHARACTER] has a feeling of
entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to mabel, whom
she declares has a "poky little house," and no toys. additionally,
she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen
and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners
as she deals with the rude creatures of wonderland. [CHARACTER] maintains
a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those
she believes are less privileged.
the tension of [CHARACTER]'s adventures in wonderland emerges
when [CHARACTER]'s fixed perspective of the world comes into contact with
the mad, illogical world of wonderland. [CHARACTER]'s fixed sense of order clashes
with the madness she finds in wonderland. the white rabbit challenges
her perceptions of class when he mistakes her for a servant, while
the mad hatter, march hare, and pigeon challenge [CHARACTER]'s notions
of urbane intelligence with an unfamiliar logic that only makes
sense within the context of wonderland. most significantly, wonderland
challenges her perceptions of good manners by constantly assaulting
her with dismissive rudeness. [CHARACTER]'s fundamental beliefs face challenges
at every turn, and as a result [CHARACTER] suffers an identity crisis.
she persists in her way of life as she perceives her sense of order
collapsing all around her. [CHARACTER] must choose between retaining her
notions of order and assimilating into wonderland's nonsensical
rules.
