front desk in case i had anything in them that i could use to kill myself or escape or attack a policeman 
with. 
 
the sergeant behind the desk had very hairy hands and he had bitten his nails so much that they had bled. 
this is what i had in my pockets 

1.  a swiss army knife with 15 attachments including a wire stripper and a saw and a toothpick and 

tweezers  

2.  a piece of string  
3.  a piece of a wooden puzzle which looked like this  

 

 

4.  3 pellets of rat food for toby, my rat  
5.  £1.47 (this was made up of a £1 coin, a 20p coin, two l0p coins, a 5p coin and a 2p coin)  
6.  a red paper clip  
7.  a key for the front door  

i was also wearing my watch and they wanted me to leave this at the desk as well but i said that i needed 
to keep my watch on because i needed to know exactly what time it was. and when they tried to take it 
off me i screamed, so they let me keep it on. 
 
they asked me if i had any family. i said i did. they asked me who my family

i said that i understood. 
 
then he said that we could go and he stood up and opened the door and we walked out into the corridor 
and back to the front desk, where i picked up my swiss army knife and my piece of string and the piece 
of the wooden puzzle and the 5 pellets of rat food for toby and my £1.47 and the paper clip and my front 
door key, which were all in a little plastic bag, and we went out to father's car, which was parked outside, 
and we drove home.

then father banged the steering wheel with his fist and the car weaved a little bit across the dotted line in 
the middle of the road and he shouted, "i said leave it, for god's sake." 
 
i could tell that he was angry because he was shouting, and i didn't want to make him angry so i didn't say 
anything else until we got home. 
 
when  we  came  in  through  the  front  door  i  went  into  the  kitchen  and  got  a  carrot  for  toby  and  i  went 
upstairs  and  i  shut  the  door  of  my  room  and i  let toby  out  and  gave  him  the  carrot.  then  i turned  my 
computer  on  and  played  76  games  of  minesweeper  and  did  the  expert  version  in  102  seconds,  which 
was only 3 seconds off my best time, which was 99 seconds.

key to mrs. shears's shed, or that she had left it unlocked, or that she had left her fork lying around in the 
garden. 
 
i heard a noise and turned round and saw mrs. shears standing on the lawn looking at me. 
 
i said, "i came to see if the fork was in the shed." 
 
and she said, "if you don't go now i will call the police again." 
 
so i went home. 
 
when i got home i said hello to father and went upstairs and fed toby, my rat, and felt happy because i 
was being a detective and finding things out.

i tried to do chatting by saying, "my age is 15 years and 3 months and 3 days." 
 
and she said, "well, almost your age." 
 
then we said nothing for a little while until she said, "you don't have a dog, do you?" 
 
and i said, "no." 
 
she said, "you'd probably like a dog, wouldn't you." 
 
and i said, "i have a rat." 
 
and she said, "a rat?" 
 
and i said, "he's called toby." 
 
and she said, "oh." 
 
and i said, "most people don't like rats because they think they carry diseases like bubonic plague. but 
that's only because they lived in sewers and stowed away on ships coming from foreign countries where 
there were strange diseases. but rats are very clean. toby is always washing himself. and you don't have 
to  take  him  out  for  walks.  i  just  let  him  run  around  my  room  so  that  he  gets  some  exercise.  and

and i said, "i have been out." this is called a white lie. a white lie is not a lie at all. it is where you tell 
the  truth  but  you  do  not  tell  all  of  the  truth.  this  means  that  everything  you  say  is  a  white  lie  because 
when someone says, for example, "what do you want to do today?" you say, "i want to do painting with 
mrs. peters," but you don't say, "i want to have my lunch and i want to go to the toilet and i want to go 
home after school and i want to play with toby and i want to have my supper and i want to play on my 
computer and i want to go to bed." and i said a white lie because i knew that father didn't want me to be 
a detective. 
 
father said, "i have just had a phone call from mrs. shears." 
 
i started eating my baked beans and broccoli and two slices of ham. 
 
then father asked, "what the hell were you doing poking round her garden?" 
 
i said, "i was doing detective work trying to find out who killed wellington." 
 
father replied, "how many

constructed  billions  of  years  ago.  for  example,  all  the  iron  in  your  blood  which  stops  you  from  being 
anemic was made in a star. 
 
and  i  would  like  it  if  i  could  take  toby  with  me  into  space,  and  that  might  be  allowed  because  they 
sometimes do take animals into space for experiments, so if i could think of a good experiment you could 
do with a rat that didn't hurt the rat, i could make them let me take toby. 
 
but if they didn't let me i would still go because it would be a dream come true.

 ___________________________
 

i wasn't going to say anything because i didn't want to get into trouble. 
 
then  i  thought  that  this  was  a  super  good  day  and  something  special  hadn't  happened  yet,  so  it  was 
possible that talking to mrs. alexander was the special thing that was going to happen. and i thought that 
she  might  tell  me  something  about  wellington  or  about  mr.  shears  without  me  asking  her,  so  that 
wouldn't be breaking my promise. 
 
so i said, "and i like maths and looking after toby. and also i like outer space and i like being on my 
own." 
 
and she said, "i bet you're very good at maths, aren't you." 
 
and i said, "i am. i'm going to do my a-level maths next month. and i'm going to get an a grade." 
 
and mrs. alexander said, "really? a-level maths?" 
 
i replied, "yes. i don't tell lies." 
 
and she said, "i apologize. i didn't mean to suggest that you were lying. i just wondered if i heard you 
correctly. i'm a little deaf sometimes." 
 
and i said, "i remember. you 
 
 ___________________________
 
probably  shouldn't  be  telling  you  this."  then  she  said,  "perhaps  we 
should take a little walk in the park together. this is not the place to be talking about this kind of thing." 
 
i was nervous. i did not know mrs. alexander. i knew that she was an old lady and that she liked dogs. 
but she was a stranger. and i never go into the park on my own because it is dangerous and people inject 
drugs behind the public toilets in the corner. i wanted to go home and go up to my room and feed toby 
and practice some maths. 
 
but i was excited, too. because i thought she might tell me a secret. and the secret might be about who 
killed wellington. or about mr. shears. and if she did that i might have more evidence against him, or be 
able to exclude him from my investigations. 
 
so because it was a super good day i decided to walk into the park with mrs. alexander, even though it 
scared me. 
 
when we were inside the park mrs. alexander stopped walking and said, "i am going to say some

shouting. and in between these noises, if i listened very carefully and stood completely still, i could hear 
a tiny whining noise inside my ears and the air going in and out of my nose. 
 
then  i  sniffed  the  air  to  see  if  i  could  see  what  the  air  in  the  garden  smelled  like.  but  i  couldn't  smell 
anything. it smelled of nothing. and this was interesting, too. 
 
then i went inside and fed toby.

the hound of the baskervilles is my favorite book. 
 
in the hound of the baskervilles, sherlock holmes and doctor watson get a visit from james mortimer, 
who is a doctor from the moors in devon. james mortimer's friend, sir charles baskerville, has died of a

ich was not 
very much because i've got to 243 before, but my brain wasn't working very well. 
 
then father came back into the room again and said, "how are you feeling? can i get you anything?" 
 
i didn't say anything. i carried on looking at my knees. 
 
and father didn't say anything either. he just sat down on the bed next to me and put his elbows on his 
knees and looked down at the carpet between his legs where there was a little red piece of lego with eight 
nobbles on. 
 
then i heard toby waking up, because he is nocturnal, and i heard him rustling in his cage. 
 
and father was silent for a really long time. 
 
then he said, "look, maybe i shouldn't say this, but. . . i want you to know that you can trust me. and. . . 
ok, maybe i don't tell the truth all the time. god knows, i try, christopher, god knows i do, but. . . life 
is difficult, you know. it's bloody hard telling the truth all the time. sometimes it's impossible. and i want 
you to know that i'm trying, i really am.

but i screamed and pushed him backward so that he fell off the bed and onto the floor. 
 
he  sat  up  and  said,  "ok.  look.  christopher.  i'm  sorry.  let's  leave  it  for  tonight,  ok?  i'm  going  to  go 
downstairs and you get some sleep and we'll talk in the morning." then he said, "it's going to be all right. 
honestly. trust me." 
 
then he stood up and took a deep breath and went out of the room. 
 
i sat on the bed for a long time looking at the floor. then i heard toby scratching in his cage. i looked up 
and saw him staring through the bars at me. 
 
i had to get out of the house. father had murdered wellington. that meant he could murder me, because i 
couldn't trust him, even though he had said "trust me," because he had told a lie about a big thing. 
 
 
but i couldn't get out of the house straightaway because he would see me, so i would have to wait until he 
was asleep. 

 
the time was 11:16 p.m. 
 
i tried doubling 2's again, but i couldn't get past

one side to the other and his foot twitched and he said "gnnnn," but his eyes 
stayed closed. and then he snored again. 
 
he was asleep. 
 
that meant i could get out of the house if i was really quiet so i didn't wake him up. 
 
i took both my coats and my scarf from the hooks next to the front door and i put them all on because it 
would be cold outside at night. then i went upstairs again really quietly, but it was difficult because my 
legs were shaking. i went into my room and i picked up toby's cage. he was making scratching noises, 
so  i  took  off  one  of  the  coats  and  put  it  over  the  cage  to  make  the  noise  quieter.  then  i  carried  him 
downstairs again. 
 
father was still asleep. 
 
i  went  into  the  kitchen  and  i  picked  up  my  special  food  box.  i  unlocked  the  back  door  and  stepped 
outside. then i held the handle of the door down as i shut it again so that the click wasn't too loud. then i 
walked down the bottom of the garden.

e  hedge  cutter  in  it,  and  lots  of 
gardening equipment that mother used to use, like pots and bags of compost and bamboo canes and string 
and spades. it would be a bit warmer in the shed but i knew that father might look for me in the shed, so i 
went round the back of the shed and i squeezed into the gap between the wall of the shed and the fence, 
behind the big black plastic tub for collecting rainwater. then i sat down and i felt a bit safer. 
 
i decided to leave my other coat over toby's cage because i didn't want him to get cold and die. 
 

i opened up my special food box. inside was the milkybar and two licorice laces and three clementines 
and  a  pink  wafer  biscuit  and  my  red  food  coloring.  i  didn't  feel  hungry  but  i  knew  that  i  should  eat 
something  because  if  you  don't  eat  something  you  can  get  cold,  so  i  ate  two  clementines  and  the 
milkybar. 
 
then i wondered what i would do next.

that makes you seem very small, and if you have difficult things in your life it is nice to think that they are 
what  is  called  negligible,  which  means  that  they  are  so  small  you  don't  have  to  take  them  into  account 
when you are calculating something. 
 
i  didn't  sleep  very  well  because  of  the  cold  and  because  the  ground  was  very  bumpy  and  pointy 
underneath me and because toby was scratching in his cage a lot. but when i woke up properly it was 
dawn and the sky was all orange and blue and purple and i could hear birds singing, which is called the 
dawn  chorus.  and  i  stayed  where  i  was  for  another  2  hours  and  32  minutes,  and  then  i  heard  father 
come into the garden and call out, "christopher. . . ? christopher. . . ?" 
 
so i turned round and i found an old plastic sack covered in mud that used to have fertilizer in it and i 
squeezed myself and t

understand why i couldn't live with father anymore. 
 
i took the licorice laces and the pink wafer biscuit and the last clementine out of my special food box and 
put them in my pocket and hid the special food box under the fertilizer bag. then i picked up toby's cage 
and my extra coat and i climbed out from behind the shed. i walked up the garden and down the side of 
the house. i undid the bolt in the garden door and walked out in front of the house. 
 
there was no one in the street so i crossed and walked up the drive to mrs. shears's house and knocked 
on the door and waited and worked out what i was going to say when she opened the door. 
 
but she didn't come to the door. so i knocked again. then i turned round and saw some people walking

n the street and i was frightened again because it was two of the people who take drugs in the house 
next door. so i grabbed toby's cage and went round the side of mrs. shears's house and sat down behind 
the dustbin so they couldn't see me. 
 
and then i had to work out what to do. 
 
and i did this by thinking of all the things i could do and deciding whether they were the right decision or 
not. 
 
i decided that i couldn't go home again. 
 
and i decided that i couldn't go and live with siobhan because she couldn't look after  me when school 
was closed because she was a teacher and not a friend or a member of my fami

de me sad to think that i could never

and  then  i  thought  that  i  had  to  be  like  sherlock  holmes  and  i  had  to  detach  my  mind  at  will  to  a 
remarkable degree so that i did not notice how much it was hurting inside my head. 
 
and then i thought i would need  money if i was going to go to london. and i would need food to eat 
because it was a long journey and i wouldn't know where to get food from. and then i thought i would 
need someone to look after toby when i went to london because i couldn't take him with me. 
 
and  then  i  formulated  a  plan.  and  that  made  me  feel  better  because  there  was  something  in my  head 
that had an order and a pattern and i just had to follow the instructions one after the other. 
 
i stood up and i made sure there was no one in the street. then i went to mrs. alexander's house, which is 
next door to mrs. shears's house, and i knocked on the door. 
 
then mrs. alexander opened the door, and she said, 
 
 ___________________________
 
"christopher, what on earth has happened to you?" 
 
and i said, "can you look after toby for me?" 
 
and she said, "who's toby?" 
 
and i said, "toby's my pet rat." 
 
then mrs. alexander said, "oh. . . oh yes i remember now. you told me." 
 
then  i  held  toby's  cage  up  and  said,  "this  is  him."  mrs.  alexander  took  a  step  backward  into  her 
hallway. and i said, "he eats special pellets and you can buy them from a pet shop. but he can also eat 
biscuits  and  carrots  and  bread  and  chicken  bones.  but  you  mustn't  give  him  chocolate  because  it's  got 
caffeine and theobromine in it, which are methylxanthines, and it's poisonous for rats in large quantities. 
and he needs new water in his bottle every day, too. and he won't mind

because he's an animal. and he likes to come out of his cage, but it doesn't matter if you don't take him 
out." 
 
then mrs. alexander said, "why do you need someone to look after toby, christopher?" 
 
and i said, "i'm going to london." 
 
and she said, "how long are you going for?" 
 
and i said, "until i go to university." 
 
and she said, "can't you take toby with you?" 
 

and  i  said,  "london's  a  long  way  away  and  i  don't  want  to  take  him  on  the  train  because  i  might  lose 
him." 
 
and mrs. alexander said, "right." and then she said, "are you and your father moving house?" 
 
and i said, "no." 
 
and she said, "so, why are you going to london?" 
 
and i said, "i'm going to live with mother." 
 
and she said, "i thought you told me your mother was dead." 
 
and i said, "i thought she was dead, but she was still alive. and fathe

my  mother  because  father  killed  wellington  and  he  lied  and  i'm 
frightened of being in the house with him." 
 
and mrs. alexander said, "is your mother here?" 
 
and i said, "no. mother is in london." 
 
and she said, "so you're going to london on your own?" 
 
and i said, "yes." 
 
and she said, "look, christopher, why don't you come inside and sit down and we can talk about this and 
work out what is the best thing to do." 
 
and i said, "no. i can't come inside. will you look after toby for me?" 
 
and she said, "i really don't think that would be a good idea, christopher." 
 
and i didn't say anything. 
 
and she said, "where's your father at the moment, christopher?" 
 
and i said, "i don't know." 
 
and she said, "well, perhaps we should try and give him a ring and see if we can get in touch with him. 
i'm sure he's worried about you. and i'm sure that there's been some dreadful misunderstanding." 
 
so i turned round and i ran across the road back to our house. and i didn'

and a yellow mini had to stop and the tires squealed on the road. and i ran down the side of the house 
and back through the garden gate and i bolted it behind me. 
 
i tried to open the kitchen door but it was locked. so i picked up a brick that was lying on the ground and 
i  smashed  it  through  the  window  and  the  glass  shattered  everywhere.  then  i  put  my  arm  through  the 
broken glass and i opened the door from the inside. 
 

i  went  into  the  house  and  i  put  toby  down  on  the  kitchen  table.  then  i  ran  upstairs  and  i  grabbed  my 
schoolbag and i put some food for toby in it and some of my maths books and some clean pants and a 
vest and a clean shirt. then i came downstairs and i opened the fridge and i put a carton of orange juice 
into my bag, and a bottle of milk that hadn't been opened. and i took two more clementines and two tins 
of  baked  beans  and  a  packet  of  custard  creams  from  the  cupboard  and  i  put  them  in  my  bag  a

s  wallet  and  his  address  book  when  he  left  the 
house. and i picked up his wallet and i took his bank card out because that was how i could get money 
because  the  card  has  a  pin which is  the  secret  code  which  you  put  into  the  machine  at  the  bank  to get 
money out and father hadn't written it down in a safe place, which is what you're meant to do, but he had 
told me because he said i'd never forget it. and it was 3558. and i put the card into my pocket. 
 
then i took toby out of his cage and put him into the pocket of one of my coats because the cage was 
very heavy to carry all the way to london. and then i went out of the kitchen door into the garden again. 
 
i  went  out  through  the  garden  gate  and  made  sure  there  wasn't  anyone  watching,  and  then  i  started 
walking  toward  the  school  because  that  was  a  direction  i  knew,  and  when  i  got  to  school  i  could  ask 
siobhan where the train station was. 
 
normally  i  would  have  got

e sick away from my mouth and i made a decision that i would have to find out how 
to get to the train station and i would do this by asking someone, and it would be a lady because when 
they talked to us about stranger danger at school they say that if a man comes up to you and talks to you 
and you feel frightened you should call out and find a lady to run to because ladies are safer. 
 
so i got out my swiss army knife and i flicked out the saw blade and i held it tightly in the pocket that 
toby wasn't in so that i could stab someone if they grabbed hold of me, and then i saw a lady on the other 
side of the street with a baby in a pushchair and a little boy with a toy elephant, so i decided to ask her. 
and this time i looked left and right and left again so that i wouldn't be run over by a car, and i crossed 
the road. 
 
and i said to the lady, "where can i buy a map?" 
 
and she said, "pardon?" 
 
and i said, "where can i buy a map?" and i could feel the hand that was holding the k

and i looked and i could see a building with writing at the top, but it was a long way away so it was hard 
to read, and i said, "do you mean the stripy building with the horizontal windows?" 
 
and she said, "that's the one." 
 
and i said, "how do i get to that building?" 
 
and she said, "gordon bennett." and then she said, "follow that bus," and she pointed to a bus that was 
going past. 
 
so i started to run. but buses go really fast and i had to make sure that toby didn't fall out of my pocket. 
but i  managed to keep running after the bus for a long way and i crossed 6 side  roads before it  turned 
down another street and i couldn't see it anymore. 

sign the lady had pointed at, so i kept on walking toward it. 

 
and then i stopped running because i was breathing really hard and my legs hurt. and i was in a street 
with lots of shops. and i remembered being in this street when i went shopping with mother. and there 
were lots of people in the street

and then i tried to think about what i had to do, but i couldn't think because there were too many other 
things in my head, so i did a maths problem to make my head clearer. 
 
and the maths problem that i

and i said, "i don't know. she lives in london. i don't know when there's a train to london." 
 
and he said, "so, you don't live with your mother?" 
 
and i said, "no. but i'm going to." 
 
and then he sat down next to me and said, "so, where does your mother live?" 
 
and i said, "in london." 
 
and he said, "yes, but where in london?" 
 
and i said, "451c chapter road, london nw2 5ng." 
 
and he said, "jesus. what is that?" 
 
and i looked down and i said, "that's my pet rat, toby," because he was looking out of my pocket at the 
policeman. 
 

and the policeman said, "a pet rat?" 
 
and i said, "yes, a pet rat. he's very clean and he hasn't got bubonic plague." 
 
and the policeman said, "well that's reassuring." 
 
and i said, "yes." 
 
and he said, "have you got a ticket?" 
 
and i said, "no." 
 
and he said, "have you got any money to get a ticket?" 
 
and i said, "no." 
 
and he said, "so, how precisely were you going to get to london, then?" 
 
and then i didn't k

and the first one said, "come on, shift it, you daft cunt. i need more beers before i sober up." 
 
and then they went away. 
 
and then the train was really quiet and it didn't move again and i couldn't hear anyone. so i decided to get 
off the shelf and go and get my bag and see if the policeman was still sitting in his seat. 
 
so i got off the shelf and i looked through the door, but the policeman wasn't there. and my bag had gone 
as well, which had toby's food in it and my maths books and my clean pants and vest and shirt and the 
orange juice and the milk and the custard creams and the baked beans. 
 
and then i heard the sound of feet and i turned round and it was another policeman, not the one who was 
on the train before, and i could see him through the door, in the next carriage, and he was looking under 
the seats. and i decided that i didn't like policemen so much anymore, so i got off the train. 
 
and when i saw how big the room was t

and i thought, "i can do this," because i was doing really well and i was in london and i would find my 
mother. and i had to think to myself, "the people are like cows in a field," and i just had to look in front 
of me all the time and make a red line along the floor in the picture of the big room in my head and follow 
it. 
 
and  i  walked  across  the  big  room  to  the  escalators.  and  i  kept  hold  of  my  swiss  army  knife  in  my 
pocket and i held on to toby in my other pocket to make sure he didn't escape. 
 
and the escalators was a staircase but it was moving and people stepped onto it and it carried them down 
and up and it made me laugh because i hadn't been on one before and it was like something in a science 
fiction film about the future. but i didn't want to use it so i went down the stairs instead. 

 
and then i was in a smaller room underground and there were lots of people and there were pillars which 
had blue lights in the ground ar

 but i was in bed and i was safe. 
 
and then the silences between the trains coming and going got longer and longer. and i could hear that 
there were fewer people in the little station when the train wasn't there, so i opened my eyes and i looked 
at  my  watch  and  it  said  8:07  p.m.  and  i had  been  sitting  on  the  bench  for approximately  5  hours  but  it 
hadn't seemed like approximately 5 hours, except that my bottom hurt and i was hungry and thirsty. 
 
and then i realized that toby was missing because he was not in my pocket, and i didn't want him to be 
missing because we weren't in father's house or mother's house and there wasn't anyone to feed him in 
the little station and he would die and he might get run over by a train. 
 
and then i looked up at the ceiling and i saw that there was a long black box which was a sign and it said 
 

 
 
and then the bottom line scrolled up and disappeared and a different line scrolled up into its place and the 
sign said

e coming, and that made me 
feel better because everything had an order and a plan. 
 
and the train came into the little station and it stopped and 5 people got onto the train and another person 
ran into the little station and got on, and 7 people got off the train and then the doors closed automatically 
and the train went away. and when the next train came i wasn't so scared anymore because the sign said 
 

 

 

so i knew it was going to happen. 
 
and then i decided that i would look for toby because there were only 3 people in the little station. so i 
stood  up  and  i  looked  up  and  down  the  little  station  and  in  the  doorways  that  went  into  tunnels  but  i 
couldn't see him anywhere. and then i looked down into the black lower-down bit where the rails were. 
 
and then i saw two mice and they were black because they were covered in dirt. and i liked that because 
i like mice and rats. but they weren't toby, so i carried on looking. 
 
and  then  i  saw  toby,  and  
 
 ___________________________
 
he  was  also  in  the  lower-down  bit  where  the  rails  were,  and  i  knew  he  was 
toby  because  he  was  white  and  he  had  a  brown  egg  shape  on  his  back.  so  i  climbed  down  off  the 
concrete. and he was eating a bit of rubbish that was an old sweet paper. and someone shouted, "jesus. 
what are you doing?" 
 
and i bent down to catch toby but he ran off. and i walked after him and i bent down again and i said, 
"toby. . . toby. . . toby," and i held out my hand so that he could smell my hand and smell that it was 
me. 
 
and someone said, "get out of there, for fuck's sake," and i looked up and it was a man who was wearing 
a  green  raincoat  and  he  had  black  shoes  and  his  socks  were  showing  and  they  were  gray  with  little 
diamond patterns on them. 
 
and i said, "toby. . . toby. . ." but he ran off again. 
 
and the man with the diamond patterns on his socks tried to grab my shoulder, so i screamed. and then i

heard the sound like sword fighting and toby started running again, but this time he ran the other way, 
which was past my feet, and i grabbed at him and i caught him by the tail. 
 
and the man with the diamond patterns on his socks said, "oh christ. oh christ." 
 
and then i heard the roaring and i lifted toby up and grabbed him with both hands and he bit me on my 
thumb and there was blood coming out and i shouted and toby tried to jump out of my hands. 
 
and then the roaring got louder and i turned round and i saw the train coming out of the tunnel and i was 
going to be run over and killed so i tried to climb up onto the concrete but it was high and i was holding 
toby in both my hands. 
 
and  then  the  man  with  the  diamond  patterns  on  his  socks  grabbed  hold  of  me  and  pulled  me  and  i 
screamed, but he kept pulling me and he pulled me up onto the concrete and we fell over and i carried on

eaming because he had hurt my shoulder. and then the train came into the station and i stood up and i 

ran  to  the  bench  again  and  i  put  toby  into  the  pocket  inside  my  jacket  and  he  went  very  quiet  and  he 
didn't move. 
 
and the man with the diamond patterns on his socks was standing next to me and he said, "what the fuck 
do you think you were playing at?" 
 
but i didn't say anything. 
 
and he said, "what were you doing?" 
 
and the doors of the train opened and people got off and there was a lady standing behind the man with 
the diamond patterns on his socks and she was carrying a guitar case like siobhan has.

and the man with the diamond patterns on his socks said, "fucking nora." 
 
and the lady with the guitar case said, "is he ok?" 
 
and the man with the diamond patterns on his socks said, "him? thanks a fucking bundle. jesus christ. 
a pet rat. oh shit. my train." and then he ran to the train and he banged on the door, which was closed, 
and the train started to go away and he said, "fuck." 
 
and the lady said, "are you ok?" and she touched my arm so i screamed again.

and the man with the diamond patterns on his socks said, "mad as a fucking hatter. jesus," and he was 
pressing a handkerchief against his face and there was blood on the handkerchief. 
 

and then another train came and the man with the diamond patterns on his socks and the lady with the 
guitar case got on and it went away again. 
 
and then 8 more trains came and i decided that i would get onto a train and then i would work out what 
to do. 
 
so i got on the next train. 
 
and toby tried to get out of my pocket so i took hold of him and i put him in my outside pocket and i 
held him with my hand. 
 
and there were 11 people in the carriage and i didn't like being in a room with 11 people in a tunnel, so i 
concentrated on things in the carriage. and there were signs saying there are 53,963 holiday cottages in 
scandinavia and germany and vitabiotics and 3435 and penalty £10 if you fail to show a valid 
ticket for your entire journey and discover gold, then bronze and tvi

and mother put her arms around me and said, "christopher, christopher, christopher." 
 
and i pushed her away because she was grabbing me and i didn't like it, and i pushed really hard and i 
fell over. 
 
and mr. shears said, "what the hell is going on?" 
 
and mother said, "i'm so sorry, christopher. i forgot." 
 
and i was lying on the ground and mother held up her right hand and spread her fingers out in a fan so 
that i could touch her fingers, but then i saw that toby had escaped out of my pockets so i had to catch 
him. 
 
and mr. shears said, "i suppose this means ed's here." and there was a wall around the garden so toby 
couldn't get out because he was stuck in the corner and he couldn't climb up the walls fast enough and i 
grabbed him and put him back in my pocket and i said, "he's hungry. have you got any food i can give 
him, and some water?" 
 
and mother said, "where's your father, christopher?" 
 
and i said, "i think he's in swindon." 
 
and mr.

and  mother  said,  "go  on  or  you'll  catch  your  death,"  but  i  didn't  know  what  you'll  catch  your  death 
meant, and i went inside. 
 
and then she said, "i'll run you a bath," and i walked round the flat to make a map of it in my head so i 
felt safer, and the flat was like this 
 

 

 
and then mother made me take my clothes off and get into the bath and she said i could use her towel, 
which  was  purple  with  green  flowers  on  the  end.  and  she  gave  toby  a  saucer  of  water  and  some  bran 
flakes  and  i  let  him  run  around  the  bathroom.  and  he  did  three  little  poos  under  the  sink  and  i  picked 
them up and flushed them down the toilet and then i got back into the bath again because it was warm and 
nice. 
 
then mother came into the bathroom and she sat on the toilet and she said, "are you ok, christopher?" 
 
and i said, "i'm very tired." 
 
and she said, "i know, love." and then she said, "you're very brave."

eard someone opening the door of the flat and there was a strange man's voice outside, so i 
locked the bathroom door. and there was an argument outside and a man said, "i need to speak to him," 
and mother said, "he's been through enough today already," and the man said, "i know. but i still need to 
speak to him." 
 
and mother knocked on the door and said a policeman wanted to talk to me and i had to open the door. 
and she said she wouldn't let him take me away and she promised. so i picked toby up and opened the 
door. 
 
and there was a policeman outside the door and he said, "are you christopher boone?" 
 
and i said i was. 
 
and he said, "your father says you've run away. is that right?" 
 
and i said, "yes." 
 
and he said, "is this your mother?" and he pointed at mother. 
 
and i said, "yes." 
 
and he said, "why did you run away?" 
 
and i said, "because father killed wellington, who is a dog, and i was frightened of him." 
 
and he said, "so i've been told." and then he said,

me and pointed her finger at my face and said, "if 
you ever do that again, i swear to god, christopher, i love you, but. . . i don't know what i'll do." 
 
so she made  me promise never to leave the flat on  my own because it was dangerous and because you 
couldn't trust people in london because they were strangers. and the next day she had to go to the shops 
again and she made me promise not to answer the door if anyone rang the bell. and when she came back 
she brought some food pellets for toby and three star trek videos and i watched them in the living room 
until mr. shears came home and then i went into the spare room again. and i wished that 451c chapter 
road, london nw2 5ng, had a garden but it didn't. 
 
and the day after that the office where mother worked rang and told her she couldn't come back to work 
because they had got someone else to do her job for her, and she was really angry and she said that it was 
illegal and she was going to complain, but mr. shears said, "don't

  "you  think  you're  so  fucking  clever,  don't  you.  don't  you  ever,  ever  think  about 
other people for one second, eh? well, i bet you're really pleased with yourself now, aren't you." 
 
and  then  mother  came  in  and  pulled  him  out of the  room  and  said,  "christopher,  i'm  sorry. i'm  really, 
really sorry." 
 
the  next  morning,  after  mr.  shears  had  gone  to  work,  mother  packed  lots  of  her  clothes  into  two 
suitcases and told me to come downstairs and bring toby and get into the car. and she put the suitcases 
into the boot and we drove off. but it was mr. shears's car and i said, "are you stealing the car?" 
 
and she said, "i'm just borrowing it." 
 
and i said, "where are we going?" 
 
and she said, "we're going home." 
 
and i said, "do you mean home in swindon?" 
 
and she said, "yes." 
 
and i said, "is father going to be there?" 
 
and she said, "please, christopher. don't give me any hassle right now, ok?"

braked when they saw the brake of the lights of the car in front coming on. but i was too tired because i 
hadn't slept the night before because i was thinking about not being able to do my maths a level. so i fell 
asleep. 
 
and when we got to swindon mother had keys to the house and we went in and she said, "hello?" but 
there was no one there because it was 1:23 p.m. and i was frightened but mother said i would be safe, so 
i went up to my room and closed the door. i took toby out of my pocket and i let him run around and i 
played minesweeper and i did the expert version in 174 seconds, which was 75 seconds longer than my 
best time. 
 
and then it was 6:35 p.m. and i heard father come home in his van and i moved the bed up against the 
door so he couldn't get in and he came into the house and he and mother shouted at each other. 
 
and father shouted, "how the fuck did you get in here?" and mother shouted, "this is my house, too, in 
case you've forgotten."

d then i picked up the bongo drums that uncle terry had bought me and i knelt down in the corner of 
the room and i pressed my head into the join between the two walls and i banged the drums and i groaned 
and  i  carried  on  doing  this  for  an  hour  and  then  mother  came  into  the  room  and  said  father  had  gone. 
and she said father had gone to stay with rhodri for a while and we would get a place to live of our own 
in the next few weeks. 
 
then i went into the garden and i found toby's cage behind the shed and i brought it inside and i cleaned 
it and put toby back in it. 
 

and i asked mother if i could do my maths a level the next day. 
 
and she said, "i'm sorry, christopher." 
 
and i said, "can i do my maths a level?" 
 
and she said, "you're not listening to me, are you, christopher." 
 
and i said, "i'm listening to you." 
 
and mother said, "i told you. i rang your headmistress. i told her you were in london. i told her you'd do 
it next year." 
 
and i said, "but

was that mother didn't get back from work till 5:30 p.m. so i had to go to father's house 
between 3:49 p.m. and 5:30 p.m., because i wasn't allowed to be on my own and mother said i didn't have 
a choice, so i pushed the bed against the door in case father tried to come in. and sometimes he tried to 
talk  to  me  through  the  door,  but  i  didn't  answer  him.  and  sometimes  i  heard  him  sitting  on  the  floor 
outside the door quietly for a long time. 
 
and another bad thing was that toby died because he was 2 years and 7 months old, which is very old for 
a rat, and i said i wanted to bury him, but mother didn't have a garden, so i buried him in a big plastic pot 
of earth like a pot you put a plant in. and i said i wanted another rat but mother said i couldn't have one 
because the room was too small. 
 
and i solved the puzzle because i worked out that there were two bolts inside the puzzle and they were 
tunnels with metal rods in them like this 
 

 

 
and you had to hold
