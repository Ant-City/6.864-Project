"sorry," he says. he should be. this is no place to be 
voicing such thoughts. 

"save it for home," i tell him. 

just then portia appears with a large man who looks 
vaguely familiar. she introduces him as plutarch 
heavensbee, the new head gamemaker. plutarch 
asks peeta if he can steal me for a dance. peeta's 
recovered his camera face and good-naturedly passes 
me over, warning the man not to get too attached. 

i don't want to dance with plutarch heavensbee. i 
don't want to feel his hands, one resting against mine, 
one on my hip. i'm not used to being touched, except 
by peeta or my family, and i rank gamemakers 
somewhere below maggots in terms of creatures i 
want in contact with my skin. but he seems to sense 
this and holds me almost at arm's length as we turn 
on the floor. 

we chitchat about the party, about the 
entertainment, about the food, and then he makes a 
joke about avoiding punch since training. i don't get 
it, and then i reali

uffered much worse than ours. i feel i have to defend 
my people. "well, there aren't very many of us in 
twelve," i say. "not that you'd know it nowadays by 
the size of the peacekeeping force. but i guess we're 
interesting enough." 

as we move over to the shelter station, wiress stops 
and gazes up at the stands where the gamemakers 
are roaming around, eating and drinking, sometimes 
taking notice of us. "look," she says, giving her head 
a slight nod in their direction. i look up and see 
plutarch heavensbee in the magnificent purple robe 
with the fur-trimmed collar that designates him as 
head gamemaker. he's eating a turkey leg. 

i don't see why this merits comment, but i say, "yes, 
he's been promoted to head gamemaker this year." 

"no, no. there by the corner of the table. you can 
just..." says wiress. 

beetee squints under his glasses. "just make it out." 

i stare in that direction, perplexed. but then i see it. a 
patch of space about six inches square at the corner 
of the table seems

ger. that's part of my job. to draw 
fire away from peeta. but how did he upset them? 
because i'd love to do just that and more. to break 
through the smug veneer of those who use their 
brains to find amusing ways to kill us. to make them

realize that while we're vulnerable to the capitol's 
cruelties, they are as well. 

do you have any idea how much i hate you? i think. 
you, who have given your talents to the games? 

i try to catch plutarch heavensbee's eye, but he 
seems to be intentionally ignoring me, as he has the 
entire training period. i remember how he sought me 
out for a dance, how pleased he was to show me the 
mockingjay on his watch. his friendly manner has no 
place here. how could it, when i'm a mere tribute and 
he's the head gamemaker? so powerful, so removed, 
so safe... 

suddenly i know just what i'm going to do. something 
that will blow anything peeta did right out of the 
water. i go over to the knot-tying station and

step away quickly to watch the reaction on the 
gamemakers' faces as they read the name on the 
dummy.

the effect on the gamemakers is immediate and 
satisfying. several let out small shrieks. others lose 
their grips on their wineglasses, which shatter 
musically against the ground. two seem to be 
considering fainting. the look of shock is unanimous. 

now i have plutarch heavensbee's attention. he 
stares steadily at me as the juice from the peach he 
crushed in his hand runs through his fingers. finally 
he clears his throat and says, "you may go now, miss 
everdeen." 

i give a respectful nod and turn to go, but at the last 
moment i can't resist tossing the container of berry 
juice over my shoulder. i can hear the contents 
splatter against the dummy while a couple more 
wineglasses break. as the elevator doors close before 
me, i see no one has moved.

say. 

"did you see any water?" asks finnick. 

"only the saltwater where we started the games," i 
say.

"there must be some other source," says peeta, 
frowning. "or well all be dead in a matter of days." 

"well, the foliage is thick. maybe there are ponds or 
springs somewhere," i say doubtfully. i instinctively 
feel the capitol might want these unpopular games 
over as soon as possible. plutarch heavensbee might 
have already been given orders to knock us off. "at 
any rate, there's no point in trying to find out what's 
over the edge of this hill, because the answer is 
nothing." 

"there must be drinkable water between the force 
field and the wheel," peeta insists. we all know what 
this means. heading back down. heading back to the 
careers and the bloodshed. with mags hardly able to 
walk and peeta too weak to fight. 

we decide to move down the slope a few hundred 
yards and continue circli

stronghold, and the possibility of my escape is 
nonexistent. it doesn't matter. i'm not escaping, just 
finishing a job. 

i creep down a narrow hallway to a metal door that 
stands slightly ajar. someone is behind it. i take out 
the syringe and grip it in my hand. flattening myself 
against the wall, i listen to the voices inside. 

"communications are down in seven, ten, and 
twelve. but eleven has control of transportation now, 
so there's at least a hope of them getting some food 
out." 

plutarch heavensbee. i think. although i've only 
really spoken with him once. a hoarse voice asks a 
question. 

"no, i'm sorry. there's no way i can get you to four. 
but i've given special orders for her retrieval if 
possible. it's the best i can do, finnick." 

finnick. my mind struggles to make sense of the 
conversation, of the fact that it's taking place between 
plutarch heavensbee and finnick. is he so near and 
dear to the capitol that he'll be excused his crimes? 
or did he really have no idea what bee

haymitch sits directly in front of me. "katniss, i'm 
going to explain what happened. i don't want you to 
ask any questions until i'm through. do you 
understand?" 

i nod numbly. and this is what he tells me. 

there was a plan to break us out of the arena from 
the moment the quell was announced. the victor

of knowledge about it. plutarch heavensbee has been, 
for several years, part of an undercover group aiming 
to overthrow the capitol. he made sure the wire was 
among the weapons. beetee was in charge of blowing 
a hole in the force field. the bread we received in the 
arena was code for the time of the rescue. the district 
where the bread originated indicated the day. three. 
the number of rolls the hour. twenty-four. the
