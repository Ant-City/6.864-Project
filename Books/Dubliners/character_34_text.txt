 person long ago who used to sing that song.”
“and who was the person long ago?” asked gabriel, smiling.
“it was a person i used to know in galway when i was living with my grandmother,” she said.
the smile passed away from gabriel’s face. a dull anger began to gather again at the back of his mind and the dull fires of his lust began to glow angrily in his veins.
“someone you were in love with?” he asked ironically.
“it was a young boy i used to know,” she answered, “named michael furey. he used to sing that song, the lass of aughrim. he was very delicate.”
gabriel was silent. he did not wish her to think that he was interested in this delicate boy.
“i can see him so plainly,” she said after a moment. “such eyes as he had: big, dark eyes! and such an expression in them—an expression!”
“o then, you were in love with him?” said gabriel.
“i used to go out walking with him,” she said, “when i was in galway.”
a thought flew across gabriel’s mind.
“perhap

aw himself as a ludicrous figure, acting as a pennyboy for his aunts, a nervous, well-meaning sentimentalist, orating to vulgarians and idealising his own clownish lusts, the pitiable fatuous fellow he had caught a glimpse of in the mirror. instinctively he turned his back more to the light lest she might see the shame that burned upon his forehead.
he tried to keep up his tone of cold interrogation, but his voice when he spoke was humble and indifferent.
“i suppose you were in love with this michael furey, gretta,” he said.
“i was great with him at that time,” she said.
her voice was veiled and sad. gabriel, feeling now how vain it would be to try to lead her whither he had purposed, caressed one of her hands and said, also sadly:
“and what did he die of so young, gretta? consumption, was it?”
“i think he died for me,” she answered.
a vague terror seized gabriel at this answer as if, at that hour when he had hoped to triumph, some impalpable and vindictive being was coming against

and he was ill at the time in his lodgings in galway and wouldn’t be let out and his people in oughterard were written to. he was in decline, they said, or something like that. i never knew rightly.”
she paused for a moment and sighed.
“poor fellow,” she said. “he was very fond of me and he was such a gentle boy. we used to go out together, walking, you know, gabriel, like the way they do in the country. he was going to study singing only for his health. he had a very good voice, poor michael furey.”
“well; and then?” asked gabriel.
“and then when it came to the time for me to leave galway and come up to the convent he was much worse and i wouldn’t be let see him so i wrote him a letter saying i was going up to dublin and would be back in the summer and hoping he would be better then.”
she paused for a moment to get her voice under control and then went on:
“then the night before i left i was in my grandmother’s house in nuns’ island, packing up, and i heard gravel throw

 now to think how poor a part he, her husband, had played in her life. he watched her while she slept as though he and she had never lived together as man and wife. his curious eyes rested long upon her face and on her hair: and, as he thought of what she must have been then, in that time of her first girlish beauty, a strange, friendly pity for her entered his soul. he did not like to say even to himself that her face was no longer beautiful but he knew that it was no longer the face for which michael furey had braved death.
perhaps she had not told him all the story. his eyes moved to the chair over which she had thrown some of her clothes. a petticoat string dangled to the floor. one boot stood upright, its limp upper fallen down: the fellow of it lay upon its side. he wondered at his riot of emotions of an hour before. from what had it proceeded? from his aunt’s supper, from his own foolish speech, from the wine and dancing, the merry-making when saying good-night in the hall, the pleasure of

w again. he watched sleepily the flakes, silver and dark, falling obliquely against the lamplight. the time had come for him to set out on his journey westward. yes, the newspapers were right: snow was general all over ireland. it was falling on every part of the dark central plain, on the treeless hills, falling softly upon the bog of allen and, farther westward, softly falling into the dark mutinous shannon waves. it was falling, too, upon every part of the lonely churchyard on the hill where michael furey lay buried. it lay thickly drifted on the crooked crosses and headstones, on the spears of the little gate, on the barren thorns. his soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead.
