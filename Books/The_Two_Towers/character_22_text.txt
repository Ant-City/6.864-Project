`elves? ' said a third, doubtfully.
`nay! not elves,' said the fourth, the tallest, and as it appeared the chief among them. `elves do not walk in ithilien in these days. and elves are wondrous fair to look upon, or so 'tis said.'
'meaning we're not, i take you,' said sam. `thank you kindly. and when you've finished discussing us, perhaps you'll say who you are, and why you can't let two tired travellers rest.'
the tall green man laughed grimly. `i am faramir, captain of gondor,' he said. `but there are no travellers in this land: only the servants of the dark tower, or of the white.'
`but we are neither,' said frodo. `and travellers we are, whatever captain faramir may say.'
'then make haste to declare yourselves and your errand,' said faramir. 'we have a work to do, and this is no time or place for riddling or parleying. come! where is the third of your company? '
`the third? '
'yes, the skulking fellow that we saw with his nose in the pool down y

'seven companions we had: one we lost at moria, the others we left at parth galen above rauros: two of my kin; a dwarf there was also, and an elf, and two men. they were aragorn; and boromir, who said that he came out of minas tirith, a city in the south.'
'boromir! ' all the four men exclaimed.
'boromir son of the lord denethor?' said faramir, and a strange stern look came into his face. 'you came with him? that is news indeed, if it be true. know, little strangers, th

'the words are known indeed,' said faramir in astonishment. `it is some token of your truth that you also know them.'
`aragorn whom i named is the bearer of the sword that was broken,' said frodo. 'and we are the halflings that the rhyme spoke of.'
`that i see,' said faramir thoughtfully. `or i see that it might be so. and what is isildur's bane? '
`that is hidden,' answered frodo. `doubtless it will be made clear in time.'
`we must learn more of this,' said faramir, `and know what brings you so far east under the shadow of yonder-,' he

'farewell!' said frodo, bowing low. `think what you will, i am a friend of all enemies of the one enemy. we would go with you, if we halfling folk could hope to serve you, such doughty men and strong as you seem, and if my errand permitted it. may the light shine on your swords!'
'the halflings are courteous folk, whatever else they be,' said faramir. `farewell!'
the hobbits sat down again, but they said nothing to one another of their thoughts and doubts. close by, just under the dappling shadow of the dark bay-trees, two men remained on guard. they took off their masks now and again to cool them, as the day-heat grew, and frodo saw that they were goodly men, pale-skinned, dark of hair, with grey eyes and faces sad and proud. they spoke together in soft voices, at first using the common speech, but after the manner of older days, and then

their talk died down into a listening silence. all seemed still and watchful. sam, crouched by the edge of the fern-brake, peered out. with his keen hobbit-eyes he saw that many more men were about. he could see them stealing up the slopes, singly or in long files, keeping always to the shade of grove or thicket, or crawling, hardly visible in their brown and green raiment, throug

it seemed to sam that he had only dozed for a few minutes when he awoke to find that it was late afternoon and faramir had come back. he had brought many men with him; indeed all the survivors of the foray were now gathered on the slope nearby, two or three hundred strong. they sat in a wide semicircle, between the arms of which faramir was seated on the ground, while frodo stood before him. it looked strangely like the trial of a prisoner.
sam crept out from the fern, but no one paid any attention to him, and he placed himself at the end of the rows of men, where he could see and hear all that was going on. he

 watched and listened intently, ready to dash to his master's aid if needed. he could see faramir's face, which was now unmasked: it was stern and commanding, and a keen wit lay behind his searching glance. doubt was in the grey eyes that gazed steadily at frodo.
sam soon became aware that the captain was not satisfied with frodo's account of himself at several points: what part he had to play in the company that set out from rivendell; why he had left boromir; and where he was now going. in particular he returned often to isildur's bane. plainly he saw that frodo was concealing from him so

'but it was at the coming of the halfling that isildur's bane should waken, or so one must read the words,' he insisted. `if then you are the halfling that was named, doubtless you brought this thing, whatever it may be, to the council of which you speak, and there boromir saw it. do you deny it? '
frodo made no answer. 'so! ' said faramir. `i wish then to learn from you more of it; for what concerns boromir concerns me. an orc-arrow slew isildur, so far as old tales tell. but orc-arrows are plenty, and the sight of one would not be taken as a sign of doom by boromir of gondor. had you this thing in keeping? it is hidden, you say; but is not that because you choose to hide it? '
'no, not because i choose,' answered frodo. `it does not belong to me. it does not belong to any mortal, great or small; though if any could claim it, it

'why so, and not boromir, prince of the city that the sons of elendil founded? '
'because aragorn is descended in direct lineage, father to father, from isildur elendil's son himself. and the sword that he bears was elendil's sword.'
a murmur of astonishment ran through all the ring of men. some cried aloud: 'the sword of elendil! the sword of elendil comes to minas tirith! great tidings! ' but faramir's face was unmoved.
`maybe,' he said. `but so great a claim will need to be established and clear proofs will be required, should this aragorn ever come to minas tirith. he had not come, nor any of your company, when i set out six days ago.'
'boromir was satisfied of that claim,' said frodo. `indeed, if boromir were here, he would answer all your questions. and since he was already at rauros many days back, and intended then to go straight to your city, if you return, you may soon learn the ans

wers there. my part in the company was known to him, as to all the others. for it was appointed to me by elrond of imladris himself before the whole council. on that errand i came into this country, but it is not mine to reveal to any outside the company. yet those who claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder it.'
frodo's tone was proud, whatever he felt, and sam approved of it; but it did not appease faramir.
`so!' he said. `you bid me mind my own affairs, and get me back home, and let you be. boromir will tell all, when he comes. when he comes, say you! were you a friend of boromir?'
vividly before frodo's mind came the memory of boromir's assault upon him, and for a moment he hesitated. faramir's eyes watching him grew harder. 'boromir was a valiant member of our company ' said frodo at length. 'yes, i was his friend, for my part.'
faramir smiled grimly. `then you would grieve to learn that borom

'i would grieve indeed,' said frodo. then catching the look in faramir's eyes, he faltered. 'dead?' he said. `do you mean that he is dead, and that you knew it? you have been trying to trap me in words, playing with me? or are you now trying to snare me with a falsehood?'
`i would not snare even an orc with a falsehood,' said faramir.
`how then did he die, and how do you know of it? since you say that none of the company had reached the city when you left.'
'as to the manner of his death, i had hoped that his friend and companion would tell me how it was.'
`but he was alive and strong when we parted. and he lives still for all that i know. though surely there are many perils in the world.'
`many indeed,' said faramir, `and treachery not the least.'
sam had been getting more and more impatient and angry at this conversation.

 these last words were more than he could bear, and bursting into the middle of the ring, he strode up to his master's side.
'begging your pardon, mr. frodo,' he said, `but this has gone on long enough. he's no right to talk to you so. after all you've gone through, as much for his good and all these great men as for anyone else.
'see here, captain! ' he planted himself squarely in front of faramir his hands on his hips, and a look on his face as if he was addressing a young hobbit who had offered him what he called `sauce' when questioned about visits to the orchard. there was some murmuring, but also some grins on the faces of the men looking on: the sight of their captain sitting on the ground and eye to eye with a young hobbit, legs well apart, bristling with wrath, was one beyond their experience. `see here! ' he said. `what are you driving at? let's come to the point before all the

`patience!' said faramir, but without anger. `do not speak before your master, whose wit is greater than yours. and i do not need any to teach me of our peril. even so, i spare a brief time, in order to judge justly in a hard matter. were i as hasty as you, i might have slain you long ago. for i am commanded to slay all whom i find in this land without the leave of the lord of gondor. but i do not slay man or beast needlessly, and not gladly even when it is needed. neither do i talk in vain. so be comforted. sit by you

sam sat down heavily with a red face. faramir turned to frodo again: 'you asked how do i know that the son of denethor is dead. tidings of death have many wings. night oft brings news to near kindred, 'tis said. boromir was my brother.'
a shadow of sorrow passed over his face. `do you remember aught of special mark that the lord boromir bore with him among his gear?'
frodo thought for a moment, fearing some further trap, and wondering how this debate would turn in the end. he had hardly saved the ring from the proud grasp of boromir, and h

ow he would fare now among so many men, warlike and strong, he did not know. yet he felt in his heart that faramir, though he was much like his brother in looks, was a man less self-regarding, both sterner and wiser. 'i remember that boromir bore a horn,' he said at last.
`you remember well, and as one who has in truth seen him,' said faramir. `then maybe you can see it in your mind's eye: a great horn of the wild ox of the east, bound with silver, and written with ancient characters. that horn the eldest son of our house has borne for many generations; and it is said that if it be blown at need anywhere within the bounds of gondor, as the realm was of old, its voice will not pass unheeded.

'alas!' said frodo. 'that was indeed boromir as i knew him. for the golden belt was given to him in lothlórien by the lady galadriel. she it was that clothed us as you see us, in elven-grey. this brooch is of the same workmanship.' he touched the green and silver leaf that fastened his cloak beneath his throat.
faramir looked closely at it. `it is beautiful,' he said. 'yes, 'tis work of the same craft. so then you passed through the land of lórien? laurelindórenan it was named of old, but long now it has lain beyond the knowledge of men,' he added softly, regarding frodo with a new wonder in his eyes. `much that was strange about you i begin now to understand. will you not tell me more? for it is a bitter thought that boromir died, within sight of the land of his home.'
'no more can i say than i have said,'

 answered frodo. `though your tale fills me with foreboding. a vision it was that you saw, i think, and no more, some shadow of evil fortune that has been or will be. unless indeed it is some lying trick of the enemy. i have seen the faces of fair warriors of old laid in sleep beneath the pools of the dead marshes, or seeming so by his foul arts.'
'nay, it was not so,' said faramir. 'for his works fill the heart with loathing; but my heart was filled with grief and pity.'
`yet how could such a thing have happened in truth? ' asked frodo. 'for no boat could have been carried over the stony hills from tol brandir; and boromir purposed to go home across the entwash and the fields of rohan. and yet how could any vessel ride the foam of the great falls and not founder in the boiling pools, though laden with water? '
'i know not,' said faramir. 'but whence came the boat? '

'you passed through the hidden land,' said faramir, `but it seems that you little understood its power. if men have dealings with the mistress of magic who dwells in the golden wood, then they may look for strange things to follow. for it is perilous for mortal man to walk out of the world of this sun, and few of old came thence unchanged, 'tis said.

`will you not put aside your doubt of me and let me go? i am weary, and full of grief, and afraid. but i have a deed to do, or to attempt, before i too am slain. and the more need of haste, if we two halflings are all that remain of our fellowship.
'go back, faramir, valiant captain of gondor, and defend your city while you may, and let me go where my doom takes me.'
`for me there is no comfort in our speech together,' said faramir; `but you surely draw from it more dread than need be. unless the people of lórien themselves came to him, who arrayed boromir as for a funeral? not orcs or servants of the nameless. some of your company, i guess, live still.

he sprang to his feet and issued some orders. at once the men who were gathered round him broke up into small groups, and went off this way and that, vanishing quickly into the shadows of the rocks and trees. soon only mablung and damrod remained.
'now you, frodo and samwise, will come with me and my guards,' said faramir. `you cannot go along the road southwards, if that was your purpose. it will be unsafe for some days, and always more closely watched after this affray than it has been yet. and you cannot, i think, go far today in any case, for you are weary. and so are we. we are going now to a secret place we have, somewhat less than ten miles from here. the orcs and spies of the enemy have not found it yet, and if they did, we could hold it long even against many. there we may lie up and rest for a while, a

there was nothing for frodo to do but to fall in with this request, or order. it seemed in any case a wise course for the moment, since this foray of the men of gondor had made a journey in ithilien more dangerous than ever.
they set out at once: mablung and damrod a little ahead, and faramir with frodo and sam behind. skirting the hither side of the pool where the hobbits had bathed, they crossed the stream, climbed a long bank, and passed into green-shadowed woodlands that marched ever downwards and westwards. while they walked, as swiftly as the hobbits could go, they talked in hushed voices.
'i broke off our speech together,' said faramir, 'not only because time pressed, as master samwise had reminded me, but also because we were drawing near to matters that were better not deba

`i told no lies, and of the truth all i could,' said frodo.
`i do not blame you,' said faramir. 'you spoke with skill in a hard place, and wisely, it seemed to me. but i learned or guessed more from you than your words said. you were not friendly with boromir, or you did not part in friendship. you, and master samwise, too, i guess have some grievance. now i loved him dearly, and would gladly avenge his death, yet i knew him well. isildur's bane - i would hazard that isildur's bane lay between you and was a cause of contention in your company. clearly it is a mighty heirloom of some sort

"how many hundreds of years needs it to make a steward a king, if the king returns not? " he asked. "few years, maybe, in other places of less royalty," my father answered. "in gondor ten thousand years would not suffice." alas! poor boromir. does that not tell you something of him? '
'it does,' said frodo. `yet always he treated aragorn with honour.'
'i doubt it not,' said faramir. `if he were satisfied of aragorn's claim as you say, he would greatly reverence him. but the pinch has not yet come. they had not yet reached minas tirith or become rivals in her wars.

'mithrandir we called him in elf-fashion,' said faramir, 'and he was content. many are my names in many countries, he said. mithrandir among the elves, tharkûn to the dwarves; olórin i was in my youth in the west that is forgotten, in the south incánus, in the north gandalf; to the east i go not.'
'gandalf!' said frodo. 'i thought it was he. gandalf the grey dearest of counsellors. leader of our company. he was lost in moria.'

'i see that there is some great tale of dread in this.' said faramir `which perhaps you may tell me in the evening-time. this mithrandir was, i now guess, more than a lore-master: a great mover of the deeds that are done in our time. had he been among us to consult concerning the hard words of our dream, he could have made them clear to us without need of messenger. yet, maybe, he would not have done so, and the journey of boromir was doomed. mithrandir never spoke to us of what was to be, nor did he reveal his purposes. he got leave of denethor, how i do not kn

now faramir's voice sank to a whisper. 'but this much i learned or guessed, and i have kept it ever secret in my heart since: that isildur took somewhat from the hand of the unnamed, ere he went away from gondor, never to be seen among mortal men again. here i thought was the answer to mithrandir's questioning. but it seemed then a matter that concerned only the seekers after ancient learning. nor when the riddling words of our dream were debated among us, did i think of isildur's bane as being this same t

'neither did the council,' said frodo. 'nor do i. i would have nothing to do with such matters.'

, to tell this grave young man, whose words seemed so wise and fair, all that was in his mind. but something held him back. his heart was heavy with fear and sorrow: if he and sam were indeed, as seemed likely, all that was now left of the nine walkers, then he was in sole command of the secret of their errand. better mistrust undeserved than rash words. and the memory of boromir, of the dreadful change that the lure of the ring had worked in him, was very present to his mind, when he looked at faramir and listened to his voice: unlike they were, and yet also much akin.
they walked on in silence for a while, passing like grey and green shadows under the old trees, their feet making no sound; above them many birds sang, and the sun glistened on the polished roof of dark leaves in the evergreen woods of ithilien.
sam had taken no part in the conversation, though he had listened; and at the same time he had attended with his keen hobbit ears to all the soft woodland noises about them. one thing

'here, alas! i must do you a discourtesy,' said faramir. "i hope you will pardon it to one who has so far made his orders give way to courtesy as not to slay you or to bind you. but it is a command that no stranger, not even one of rohan that fights with us, shall see the path we now go with open eyes. i must blindfold you.'
`as you will,' said frodo. 'even the elves do likewise at need, and blindfolded we crossed the borders of fair lothlórien. gimli the dwarf took it ill, but the hobbits endured it.'

he called softly and immediately mablung and damrod stepped out of the trees and came back to him.

with green scarves the two guards now bound up the hobbits' eyes and drew their hoods down almost to their mouths; then quickly they took each one by the hand and went on their way. all that frodo and sam knew of this last mile of the road the

rection. they climbed upwards a little: it seemed cold and the noise of the stream had become faint. then they were picked up and carried down, down many steps, and round a corner. suddenly they heard the water again, loud now, rushing and splashing. all round them it seemed, and they felt a fine rain on their hands and cheeks. at last they were set on their feet once more. for a moment they stood so, half fearful, blindfold, not knowing where they were; and no one spoke.
then came the voice of faramir close behind. `let them see! ' he said. the scarves were removed and their hoods drawn back, and they blinked and gasped.
they stood on a wet floor of polished stone, the doorstep, as it were, of a rough-hewn gate of rock opening dark behind them. but in front a thin veil of water was hung, so near that frodo could have put an outstretched arm into it. it faced westward. the level shafts of the setting sun behind beat upon it, and the red light was broken into many flickering beams of ever-chan

'at least by good chance we came at the right hour to reward you for your patience,' said faramir. `this is the window of the sunset, henneth annûn, fairest of all the falls of ithilien, land of many fountains. few strangers have ever seen it. but there is no kingly hall behind to match it. enter now and see! '
even as he spoke the sun sank, and the fire faded in the flowing water. they turned and passed under the low forbidding arch. at once they found themselves in a rock-chamber, wide and rough, with an uneven stooping roof. a few torches were kindled and cast a dim light on the glisten

ing walls. many men were already there. others were still coming in by twos and threes through a dark narrow door on one side. as their eyes grew accustomed to the gloom the hobbits saw that the cave was larger than they had guessed and was filled with great store of arms and victuals.
'well, here is our refuge,' said faramir. `not a place of great ease but here you may pass the night in peace. it is dry at least, and there is food, though no fire. at one time the water flowed down through this cave and out of the arch, but its course was changed further up the gorge, by workmen of old, and the stream sent down in a fall of doubled height over the rocks far above. all the ways into this grot were then sealed against the entry of water or aught else, all save one. there are now but two ways out: that passage yonder b

if they wished. meanwhile men busied themselves about the cave, quietly and in orderly quickness. light tables were taken from the walls and set up on trestles and laden with gear. this was plain and unadorned for the most part, but all well and fairly, made: round platters, bowls and dishes of glazed brown clay or turned box-wood, smooth and clean. here and there was a cup or basin of polished bronze; and a goblet of plain silver was set by the captain's seat in the middle of the inmost table.
faramir went about among the men, questioning each as he came in, in a soft voice. some came back from the pursuit of the southrons; others, left behind as scouts near the road, came in latest. all the southrons had been accounted for, save only the great mûmak: what happened to him none could say. of the enemy no movement could be seen; not even an orc-spy was abroad.
'you saw and heard nothing, anborn?' faramir asked of the latest comer.
`well, no, lord,' said the man. `no orc at least. but i saw, o

e, and it seemed no more, so i tried no arrow. it was too dark for sure shooting anyway, and the creature was gone into the gloom of the leaves in a twinkling. but i stayed for a while, for it seemed strange, and then i hastened back. i thought i heard the thing hiss at me from high above as i turned away. a large squirrel, maybe. perhaps under the shadow of the unnamed some of the beasts of mirkwood are wandering hither to our woods. they have black squirrels there, 'tis said.'
`perhaps,' said faramir. `but that would be an ill omen, if it were so. we do not want the escapes of mirkwood in ithilien.' sam fancied that he gave a swift glance towards the hobbits as he spoke; but sam said nothing. for a while he and frodo lay back and watched the torchlight, and the men moving to and fro speaking in hushed voices. then suddenly frodo fell asleep.
sam struggled with himself, arguing this way and that. `he may be all right,' he thought, 'and then he may not. fair speech may hide a foul heart.' he

t faded from the cave door, and the grey veil of falling water grew dim and was lost in gathering shadow. always the sound of the water went on, never changing its note, morning or evening or night. it murmured and whispered of sleep. sam stuck his knuckles in his eyes.
now more torches were being lit. a cask of wine was broached. storage barrels were being opened. men were fetching water from the fall. some were laving their hands in basins. a wide copper bowl and a white cloth were brought to faramir and he washed.
`wake our guests,' he said, `and take them water. it is time to eat.'
frodo sat up and yawned and stretched. sam, not used to being waited on, looked with some surprise at the tall man who bowed, holding a basin of water before him.
'put it on the ground, master, if you please! ' he said. 'easier for me and you.' then to the astonishment and amusement of the men he plunged his head into the cold water and splashed his neck and ears.
'is it the custom in your land to wash the head

 before supper? ' said the man who waited on the hobbits.
`no, before breakfast,' said sam. `but if you're short of sleep cold water on the neck's like rain on a wilted lettuce. there! now i can keep awake long enough to eat a bit.'
they were led then to seats beside faramir: barrels covered with pelts and high enough above the benches of the men for their convenience. before they ate, faramir and all his men turned and faced west in a moment of silence. faramir signed to frodo and sam that they should do likewise.
'so we always do.' he said, as they sat down: `we look towards númenor that was, and beyond to elvenhome that is, and to that which is beyond elvenhome and will ever be. have you no such custom at meat? '
`no,' said frodo, feeling strangely rustic and untutored. `but if we are guests, we bow to our host, and after we have eaten we rise and thank him.'
'that we do also,' said faramir.

he lonely wild, the evening meal seemed a feast to the hobbits: to drink pale yellow wine, cool and fragrant, and eat bread and butter, and salted meats, and dried fruits, and good red cheese, with clean hands and clean knives and plates. neither frodo nor sam refused anything that was offered, nor a second, nor indeed a third helping. the wine coursed in their veins and tired limbs, and they felt glad and easy of heart as they had not done since they left the land of lórien.
when all was done faramir led them to a recess at the back of the cave, partly screened by curtains; and a chair and two stools were brought there. a little earthenware lamp burned in a niche.
`you may soon desire to sleep,' he said, 'and especially good samwise, who would not close his eyes before he ate - whether for fear of blunting the edge of a noble hunger, or for fear of me, i do not know. but it is not good to sleep too soon after meat, and that following a fast. let us talk a while. on your journey from rivende

his ease, he had not lost all his caution. sam was beaming and humming to himself, but when frodo spoke he was at first content to listen, only occasionally venturing to make an exclamation of agreement.
frodo told many tales, yet always he steered the matter away from the quest of the company and from the ring, enlarging rather on the valiant part boromir had played in all their adventures. with the wolves of the wild, in the snows under caradhras, and in the mines of moria where gandalf fell. faramir was most moved by the story of the fight on the bridge.
`it must have irked boromir to run from orcs,' he said, `or even from the fell thing you name, the balrog - even though he was the last to leave.'
`he was the last,' said frodo, 'but aragorn was forced to lead us. he alone knew the way after gandalf's fall. but had there not been us lesser folk to care for, i do not think that either he or boromir would have fled.'
`maybe, it would have been better had boromir fallen there with mithrandir,

'maybe. but tell me now of your own fortunes,' said frodo, turning the matter aside once again. `for i would learn more of minas ithil and osgiliath, and minas tirith the long-enduring. what hope have you for that city in your long war? '
'what hope have we? ' said faramir. 'it is long since we had any hope. the sword of elendil, if it returns indeed, may rekindle it, but i do not think that it will do more than put off the evil day, unless other help unlooked-for also comes, from elves or men. for the enemy increases and we decrease. we are a failing people, a springless autumn.
`the men of númenor were settled far and wide on the shores and seaward regions of the great lands, but for the most part they fell into evils and follies. many became enamoured of the

ort and an end; and though we still hold that a warrior should have more skills and knowledge than only the craft of weapons and slaying, we esteem a warrior, nonetheless, above men of other crafts. such is the need of our days. so even was my brother, boromir: a man of prowess, and for that he was accounted the best man in gondor. and very valiant indeed he was: no heir of minas tirith has for long years been so hardy in toil, so onward into battle, or blown a mightier note on the great horn.' faramir sighed and fell silent for a while.
`you don't say much in all your tales about the elves, sir,' said sam, suddenly plucking up courage. he had noted that faramir seemed to refer to elves with reverence, and this even more than his courtesy, and his food and wine, had won sam's respect and quieted his suspicions.
`no indeed, master samwise,' said faramir, `for i am not learned in elven-lore. but there you touch upon another point in which we have changed, declining from númenor to middle-earth

'then she must be lovely indeed,' said faramir. `perilously fair.'
`i don't know about perilous,' said sam. `it strikes me that folk takes their peril with them into lórien, and finds it there because they've brought it. but perhaps you could call her perilous, because she's so strong in herself. you, you could dash yourself to pieces on her, like a ship on a rock; or drownd yourself, like a hobbit in a river. but neither rock nor river would be to blame. now boro - ' he stopped and went red in the face.
`yes? now boromir you would say? '

said faramir. `what would you say? he took his peril with him? '
`yes sir, begging your pardon, and a fine man as your brother was if i may say so. but you've been warm on the scent all along. now i watched boromir and listened to him, from rivendell all down the road - looking after my master, as you'll understand, and not meaning any harm to boromir - and it's my opinion that in lórien he first saw clearly what i guessed sooner: what he wanted. from the moment he first saw it he wanted the enemy's ring!

`sam! ' cried frodo aghast. he had fallen deep into his own thoughts for a while, and came out of them suddenly and too late.
'save me! ' said sam turning white, and then flushing scarlet. `there i go again! when ever you open your big mouth you put your foot in it the gaffer used to say to me, and right enough. o dear, o dear!
`now look here, sir! ' he turned, facing up to faramir with all the courage that he could muster. `don't you go taking advantage of my master because his servant's no better than a fool. you've spoken very handsome all along, put me off my guard, talking of elves and all. but handsome is as handsome does we say. now's a chance to show your quality.'
'so it seems,' said faramir, slowly and very softly, with a strange smile. `so that is the answer to all the riddles! the one ring that was thought to have perished from the world. and boromir tried to

frodo and sam sprang from their stools and set themselves side by side with their backs to the wall, fumbling for their sword-hilts. there was a silence. all the men in the cave stopped talking and looked towards them in wonder. but faramir sat down again in his chair and began to laugh quietly, and then suddenly became grave again.
'alas for boromir! it was too sore a trial! ' he said. `how

strange though it may seem, it was safe to declare this to me. it may even help the master that you love. it shall turn to his good, if it is in my power. so be comforted. but do not even name this thing again aloud. once is enough.'
the hobbits came back to their seats and sat very quiet. men turned back to their drink and their talk, perceiving that their captain had had some jest or other with the little guests, and that it was over.
'well, frodo, now at last we understand one another,' said faramir. 'if you took this thing on yourself, unwilling, at others' asking, then you have pity and honour from me. and i marvel at you: to keep it hid and not to use it. you are a new people and a new world to me. are all your kin of like sort? your land must be a realm of peace and content, and there must gardeners be in high honour.'
`not all is well there,' said frodo, `but certainly gardeners are honoured.'
`but folk must grow weary there, even in their gardens, as do all things under the sun of th

for i must watch, and wait, and think. time passes. in the morning we must each go swiftly on the ways appointed to us.'
frodo had felt himself trembling as the first shock of fear passed. now a great weariness came down on him like a cloud. he could dissemble and resist no longer.
'i was going to find a way into mordor,' he said faintly. `i was going to gorgoroth. i must find the mountain of fire and cast the thing into the gulf of doom. gandalf said so. i do not think i shall ever get there.'
faramir stared at him for a moment in grave astonishment. then suddenly he caught him as he swayed, and lifting him gently, carried him to the bed and laid him there, and covered him warmly. at once he fell into a deep sleep.
another bed was set beside him for his servant. sam hesitated for a moment, then bowing very low: `good night, captain, my lord,' he said. `you took the chance, sir.'
`did i so?' said faramir.
`yes sir, and showed your quality: the very highest.'
faramir smiled. 'a pert servant, m

`ah well, sir,' said sam, `you said my master had an elvish air and that was good and true. but i can say this: you have an air too, sir, that reminds me of, of - well, gandalf, of wizards.
'maybe,' said faramir. `maybe you discern from far away the air of númenor. good night!'

the forbidden pool

frodo woke to find faramir bending over him. for a second old fears seized him and he sat up and shrank away.
`there is nothing to fear,' said faramir.
'is it morning already? ' said frodo yawning.
`not yet, but night is drawing to an end, and the full moon is setting. will you come and see it? also there is a matter on which i desire your counsel. i am sorry to rouse you from sleep, but will you

 come? '
`i will,' said frodo, rising and shivering a little as he left the warm blanket and pelts. it seemed cold in the fireless cave. the noise of the water was loud in the stillness. he put on his cloak and followed faramir.
sam, waking suddenly by some instinct of watchfulness, saw first his master's empty bed and leapt to his feet. then he saw two dark figures, frodo and a man, framed against the archway, which was now filled with a pale white light. he hurried after them, past rows of men sleeping on mattresses along the wall. as he went by the cave-mouth he saw that the curtain was now become a dazzling veil of silk and pearls and silver thread: melting icicles of moonlight. but he did not pause to admire it,

for a while frodo stood there on the high stone, and a shiver ran through him, wondering if anywhere in the vastness of the night-lands his old companions walked or slept, or lay dead shrouded in mist. why was he brought here out of forgetful sleep?
sam was eager for an answer to the same question and could not refrain himself from muttering, for his master's ear alone as he thought: 'it's a fine view, no doubt, mr. frodo, but chilly to the heart, not to mention the bones! what's going on? '
faramir heard and answered. `moonset over gondor. fair ithil as he goes from middle-earth, glances upon the white locks of old mindolluin. it is worth a few shivers. but that is not what i brought you to see-though as for you, samwise, you were not brought, and do but pay the penalty of your watchfulness. a draught of wine shall amend it. come, look now!

he stepped up beside the silent sentinel on the dark edge. and frodo followed. sam hung back. he already felt insecure enough on this high wet platf

t beyond the boil and bubble of the fall, cleaving the black water as neatly as an arrow or an edgewise stone.
faramir turned to the man at his side. `now what would you say that it is, anborn? a squirrel, or a kingfisher? are there black kingfishers in the night-pools of mirkwood? '
`'tis not a bird, whatever else it be,' answered anborn. `it has four limbs and dives manwise; a pretty mastery of the craft it shows, too. what is it at? seeking a way up behind the curtain to our hidings? it seems we are discovered at last. i have my bow here, and i have posted other archers, nigh as good marksmen as myself, on e

`shall we shoot? ' said faramir, turning quickly to frodo.
frodo did not answer for a moment. then `no! ' he said. `no! i beg you not to.' if sam had dared, he would have said `yes,' quicker and louder. he could not see, but he guessed well enough from their words what they were looking at.
'you know, then, what this thing is? ' said faramir. `come, now you have seen, tell me why it should be spared. in all our words together you have not once spoken of your gangrel companion, and i let him be for the time. he could wait till he was caught and brought before me. i sent my keenest huntsmen to seek him, but he slipped them, and they had no sight of him till now, save anborn here, once at dusk yesterevening. but now he has done worse trespass than only to go coney-snaring in the uplands: he has dared to come to henneth annûn, and his

 i marvel at the creature: so secret and so sly as he is, to come sporting in the pool before our very window. does he think that men sleep without watch all night? why does he so?'
'there are two answers, i think,' said frodo. `for one thing, he knows little of men, and sly though he is, your refuge is so hidden that perhaps he does not know that men are concealed here. for another, i think he is allured here by a mastering desire, stronger than his caution.'
`he is lured here, you say? ' said faramir in a low voice. `can he, does he then know of your burden? '
`indeed yes. he bore it himself for many years.'
'he bore it? ' said faramir, breathing sharply in his wonder. `this matter winds itself ever in new riddles. then he is pursuing it? '
'maybe. it is precious to him. but i did not speak of that.'
`what then does the creature seek? '
`fish,' said frodo. `look! '
they peered down at the dark pool. a little black head appeared at the far end of the basin, just out of the deep shadow of the

 rocks. there was a brief silver glint, and a swirl of tiny ripples. it swam to the side, and then with marvellous agility a froglike figure climbed out of the water and up the bank. at once it sat down and began to gnaw at the small silver thing that glittered as it turned: the last rays of the moon were now falling behind the stony wall at the pool's end.
faramir laughed softly. `fish! ' he said. `it is a less perilous hunger. or maybe not: fish from the pool of henneth annûn may cost him all he has to give.'
`now i have him at the arrow-point,' said anborn. `shall i not shoot, captain? for coming unbidden to this place death is our law.'
`wait, anborn,' said faramir. `this is a harder matter than it seems. what have you to say now, frodo? why should we spare? '
`the creature is wretched and hungry,' said frodo, `and unaware of his danger. and gandalf,

`your guide! ' said faramir. `the matter becomes ever stranger. i would do much for you, frodo, but this i cannot grant: to let this sly wanderer go free at his own will from here, to join you later if it please him, or to be caught by orcs and tell all he knows under threat of pain. he must be slain or taken. slain, if he be not taken very swiftly. but how can this slippery thing of many guises be caught, save by a feathered shaft?

`let me go down quietly to him,' said frodo. `you may keep your bows bent, and shoot me

`go then and be swift! ' said faramir. `if he comes off alive, he should be your faithful servant for the rest of his unhappy days. lead frodo down to the bank, anborn, and go softly. the thing has a nose and ears. give me your bow.'
anborn grunted and led the way down the winding stair to the landing, and then up the other stair, until at last they came to a narrow opening shrouded with thick bushes. passing silently through, frodo found himself on the top of the southern bank above the pool. it was now dark and the falls were pal

`we must trust master? ' said gollum doubtfully. 'why? why not go at once? where is the other one, the cross rude hobbit? where is he?'
'away up there,' said frodo, pointing to the waterfall. 'i am not going without him. we must go back to him.' his heart sank. this was too much like trickery. he did not really fear that faramir would allow gollum to be killed, but he would probably make him prisoner and bind him; and certainly what frodo did would seem a treachery to the poor treacherous creature. it would probably be impossible ever to make him understand or believe that frodo had saved his life in the only way he could. what else could he do? - to keep faith, as near as might be, with both sides. `come!' he said. `or the precious will be angry. we are going back now, up the stream. go on, go on, you go in front!

'yes. well no, i didn't get him. he came to me, because he trusted me at first, i'm afraid. i did not want him tied up like this. i hope it will be all right; but i hate the whole business.'
`so do i,' said sam. `and nothing will ever be all right where that piece of misery is.'
a man came and beckoned to the hobbits, and took them to the recess at the back of the cave. faramir was sitting there in his chair, and the lamp had been rekindled in its niche above his head. he signed to them to sit down on the stools beside him. `bring wine for the guests,' he said. `and bring the prisoner to me.'
the wine was brought, and then anborn came carrying gollum. he removed the cover from gollum's head and set him on his feet standing behind him to support him. gollum blinked, hooding the malice of his eyes with their heavy pale lids. a very miserable creature he looked, dripping

`loose us! loose us! ' he said. `the cord hurts us, yes it does, it hurts us, and we've done nothing.'
`nothing? ' said faramir, looking at the wretched creature with a keen glance, but without any expression in his face either of anger, or pity, or wonder. 'nothing? have you never done anything worthy of binding or of worse punishment? however, that is not for me to judge, happily. but tonight you have come where it is death to come. the fish of this pool are dearly bought.'
gollum dropped the fish from his hand. `don't want fish,' he said.
'the price is not set on the fish,' said faramir. `only to come here and look o

`we are lost, lost,' said gollum. 'no name, no business, no precious, nothing. only empty. only hungry; yes, we are hungry. a few little fishes, nasty bony little fishes, for a poor creature, and they say death. so wise they are; so just, so very just.'
'not very wise,' said faramir. 'but just: yes perhaps, as just as our little wisdom allows. unloose him frodo! ' faramir took a small nail-knife from his belt and handed it to frodo. gollum misunderstanding the gesture, squealed and fell down.
'now, sméagol! ' said frodo. 'you must trust me. i will not desert you. answer truthfully, if you can. it will do you good not harm.' he cut the cords on gollum's wrists and ankles and raised him to his feet.
'come hither! ' said faramir. `look at me! do you know the name of this pla

slowly gollum raised his eyes and looked unwillingly into faramir's. all light went out of them, and they stared bleak and pale for a moment into the clear unwavering eyes of the man of gondor. there was a still silence. then gollum dropped his head and shrank down, until he was squatting on the floor, shivering. 'we doesn't know and we doesn't want to know,' he whimpered. `never came here; never come again.'
`there are locked doors and closed windows in your mind, and dark rooms behind them,' said faramir. `but in this i judge that you speak the truth. it is

`master knows,' said gollum with a sidelong glance at frodo. `yes, he knows. we will promise master, if he saves us. we'll promise to it, yes.' he crawled to frodo's feet. 'save us, nice master! ' he whined. `sméagol promises to precious, promises faithfully. never come again, never speak, no never! no, precious, no!'
`are you satisfied? ' said faramir.
`yes,' said frodo. 'at least, you must either accept this promise or carry out your law. you will get no more. but i promised that if he came to me, he should not be harmed. and i would not be proved faithless.'
faramir sat for a moment in thought. `very good,' he said at last. `i surrender you to your master, to frodo son of drogo. let him declare what he will do with you! '
'but, lord faramir,' said frodo bowing, `you have not yet declared your will concerning the said frodo, and until that

`then i will declare my doom,' said faramir. `as for you, frodo, in so far as lies in me under higher authority, i declare you free in the realm of, gondor to the furthest of its ancient bounds; save only that neither you nor any that go with you have leave to come to this place unbidden. this doom shall stand for a year and a day, and then cease, unless you shall before that term come to minas tirith and present yourself to the lord and steward of the city. then i will entreat him to confirm what i have done and to make it lifelong. in

the meantime, whomsoever you take under your protection shall be under my protection and under the shield of gondor. are you answered? '
frodo bowed low. 'i am answered,' he said, `and i place myself at your service, if that is of any worth to one so high and honourable.'
`it is of great worth,' said faramir. 'and now, do you take this creature, this sméagol, under your protection? '
`i do take sméagol under my protection,' said frodo. sam sighed audibly; and not at the courtesies, of which, as any hobbit would, he thoroughly approved. indeed in the shire such a matter would have required a great many more words and bows.
'then i say to you,' said faramir, turning to gollum, 'you are under doom of death; but while you walk with frodo you are safe for our part. yet if ever you be found by any man

of gondor astray without him, the doom shall fall. and may death find you swiftly, within gondor or without, if you do not well serve him. now answer me: whither would you go? you were his guide, he says. whither were you leading him? ' gollum made no reply.
`this i will not have secret,' said faramir. `answer me, or i will reverse my judgement! ' still gollum did not answer.
`i will answer for him,' said frodo. `he brought me to the black gate, as i asked; but it was impassable.'
`there is no open gate into the nameless land,' said faramir.
`seeing this, we turned aside and came by the southward road ' frodo continued; 'for he said that there is, or there may be, a path near to minas ithil.'
`minas morgul,' said faramir.
`i do not know clearly,' said frodo; `but the path climbs, i think, up

 into the mountains on the northern side of that vale where the old city stands. it goes up to a high cleft and so down to - that which is beyond.'
`do you know the name of that high pass? ' said faramir.
'no,' said frodo.
'it is called cirith ungol.' gollum hissed sharply and began muttering to himself. `is not that its name? ' said faramir turning to him.
`no! ' said gollum, and then he squealed, as if something had stabbed him. 'yes, yes, we heard the name once. but what does the name matter to us? master says he must get in. so we must try some way. there is no other way to try, no.'
'no other way? ' said faramir. `how do you know that? and who has explored all the confines of that dark realm? ' he looked long and thoughtfully at gollum. presently he spoke again. `take this creature away, anborn. treat him gently, but watch him

anborn went out and gollum went cringing before him. the curtain was drawn across the recess.
`frodo, i think you do very unwisely in this,' said faramir. `i do not think you should go with this creature. it is wicked.'
'no, not altogether wicked,' said frodo.
'not wholly, perhaps,' said faramir; 'but malice eats it like a canker, and the evil is growing. he will lead you to no good. if you will part with him, i will give him safe-conduct and guidance to any point on the borders of gondor that he may name.'
`he would not take it,' said frodo. 'he would follow after me as he long has done. and i have promised many times to take him under my protection and to go where he led. you would not ask me to break faith with him?'
'no,' said faramir. `but my heart would. for it seems less evil to

'we of gondor do not ever pass east of the road in these days, and none of us younger men has ever done so, nor has any of us set foot upon the mountains of shadow. of them we know only old report and the rumour of bygone days. but there is some dark terror that dwells in the passes above minas morgul. if cirith ungol is named, old men and masters of lore will blanch and fall silent.
,the valley of minas morgul passed into evil very long ago, and it was a menace and a dread while the banished

m. but over the mountains i am bound, by solemn undertaking to the council, to find a way or perish in the seeking. and if i turn back, refusing the road in its bitter end, where then shall i go among elves or men? would you have me come to gondor with this thing, the thing that drove your brother mad with desire? what spell would it work in minas tirith? shall there be two cities of minas morgul, grinning at each other across a dead land filled with rottenness? '
`i would not have it so,' said faramir.
`then what would you have me do? '
`i know not. only i would not have you go to death or to torment. and i do not think that mithrandir would have chosen this way.'
'yet since he is gone, i must take such paths as i can find. and there is no time for long searching,' said frodo.
`it is a hard doom and a hopeless errand,' said faramir. 'but at the least, remember my warning: beware of this guide, sméagol. he has done murder before now. i read it in him.' he sighed.
`well, so we meet and part,

he rose and bowed low to frodo, and drawing the curtain passed out into the cave.

chapter 7

journey to the cross-roads

frodo and sam returned to their beds and lay there in silence resting for a little, while men bestirred themselves and the business of the day began. after a while water was brought to them, and then they were led to a table where food was set for three. faramir broke his fast with them. he had not slept since the battle on the day before, yet he did not look weary.
when they had finished they stood up. `may no hunger trouble you on the road,' said faramir. `you have little provision, but some small store of food fit for travellers i have ordered to be stowed in your packs. you will have no lack of water as you walk in ithilien, but do not drink of any stream that flows from imlad morgul, the valley of living death. this also i must tell you. my scouts

silence broods above the nameless land. i do not know what this portends. but the time draws swiftly to some great conclusion. storm is coming. hasten while you may! if you are ready, let us go. the sun will soon rise above the shadow.'
the hobbits' packs were brought to them (a little heavier than they had been), and also two stout staves of polished wood, shod with iron, and with carven heads through which ran plaited leathern thongs.
'i have no fitting gifts to give you at our parting,' said faramir; `but take these staves. they may be of service to those who walk or climb in the wild. the men of the white mountains use them; though these have been cut down to your height and newly shod. they are made of the fair tree lebethron, beloved of the woodwrights of gondor, and a virtue has been set upon them of finding and returning. may that virtue not wholly fail under the shadow into which you go!'
the hobbits bowed low. `most gracious host,' said frodo, 'it was said to me by elrond halfelven

that i should find friendship upon the way, secret and unlooked for. certainly i looked for no such friendship as you have shown. to have found it turns evil to great good.'
now they made ready to depart. gollum was brought out of some corner or hiding-hole, and he seemed better pleased with himself than he had been, though he kept close to frodo and avoided the glance of faramir.
'your guide must be blindfolded,' said faramir, 'but you and your servant samwise i release from this, if you wish.'
gollum squealed, and squirmed, and clutched at frodo, when they came to bind his eyes; and frodo said: 'blindfold us all three, and cover up my eyes first, and then perhaps he will see that no harm is meant.' this was done, and they were led from the cave of henneth annûn. after they had passed the passages and stairs they felt the cool morning air, fresh and sweet, about them. still blind they went on for some little time,

up and then gently down. at last the voice of faramir ordered them to be uncovered.
they stood under the boughs of the woods again. no noise of the falls could be heard, for a long southward slope lay now between them and the ravine in which the stream flowed. to the west they could see light through the trees, as if the world came there to a sudden end, at a brink looking out only on to sky.
'here is the last parting of our ways,' said faramir. 'if you take my counsel, you will not turn eastward yet. go straight on, for thus you will have the cover of the woodland for many miles. on your west is an edge where the land falls into the great vales, sometimes suddenly and sheer, sometimes in long hillsides. keep near to this edge and the skirts of the forest. in the beginning of your journey you may walk under daylight, i think. the land dreams in a false peace, and for a while all evil is withdrawn. fare you well, while you may!'

raced the hobbits then, after the manner of his people, stooping, and placing his hands upon their shoulders, and kissing their foreheads. 'go with the good will of all good men!' he said.
they bowed to the ground. then he turned and without looking back he left them and went to his two guards that stood at a little distance away. they marvelled to see with what speed these green-clad men now moved, vanishing almost in the twinkling of an eye. the forest where faramir had stood seemed empty and drear, as if a dream had passed.
frodo sighed and turned back southward. as if to mark his disregard of all such courtesy, gollum was scrabbling in the mould at the foot of a tree. `hungry again already?' thought sam. `well, now for it again!'
'have they gone at last? ' said gollum. `nassty wicked men! sméagol's neck still hurts him, yes it does. let's go! '
`yes, let us go,' said frodo. `but if you can only speak ill of those who showed you mercy, keep silent! '

ce master! ' said gollum. `sméagol was only joking. always forgives, he does, yes, yes, even nice master's little trickses. oh yes, nice master, nice sméagol! '
frodo and sam did not answer. hoisting their packs and taking their staves in hand, they passed on into the woods of ithilien.
twice that day they rested and took a little of the food provided by faramir: dried fruits and salted meat, enough for many days; and bread enough to last while it was still fresh. gollum ate nothing.
the sun rose and passed overhead unseen, and began to sink, and the light through the trees to the west grew golden; and always they walked in cool green shadow, and all about them was silence. the birds seemed all to have flown away or to have fallen dumb.
darkness came early to the silent woods, and before the fall of night they halted, weary, for they had walked seven l

 struck, and at his great master's bidding he must march with war into the west.
soon he had passed, like a shadow into shadow, down the winding road, and behind him still the black ranks crossed the bridge. so great an army had never issued from that vale since the days of isildur's might; no host so fell and strong in arms had yet assailed the fords of anduin; and yet it was but one and not the greatest of the hosts that mordor now sent forth.
frodo stirred. and suddenly his heart went out to faramir. 'the storm has burst at last,' he thought. `this great array of spears and swords is going to osgiliath. will faramir get across in time? he guessed it, but did he know the hour? and who can now hold the fords when the king of the nine riders comes? and other armies will come. i am too late. all is lost. i tarried on the way. all is lost. even if my errand is performed, no one will ever know. there will be no one i can tell. it will be in vain.' overcome with weakness he wept. and still the ho

up, mr. frodo! they're gone, and we'd better go too. there's something still alive in that place, something with eyes, or a seeing mind, if you take me; and the longer we stay in one spot, the sooner it will get on to us. come on, mr. frodo! '
frodo raised his head, and then stood up. despair had not left him, but the weakness had passed. he even smiled grimly, feeling now as clearly as a moment before he had felt the opposite, that what he had to do, he had to do, if he could, and that whether faramir or aragorn or elrond or galadriel or gandalf or anyone else ever knew about it was beside the purpose. he took his staff in one hand and the phial in his other. when he saw that the clear light was already welling through his fingers, he thrust it into his bosom and held it against his heart. then turning from the city of morgul, now no more than a grey glimmer across a dark gulf, he prepared to take the upward road.
gollum, it seemed, had crawled off along the ledge into the darkness beyond, w

ers of the waybread of the elves. and they drank a little. but of their water they were sparing and took only enough to moisten their dry mouths.
`i wonder when we'll find water again? ' said sam. 'but i suppose even over there they drink? orcs drink, don't they? '
'yes, they drink,' said frodo. 'but do not let us speak of that. such drink is not for us.'
`then all the more need to fill our bottles,' said sam. `but there isn't any water up here: not a sound or a trickle have i heard. and anyway faramir said we were not to drink any water in morgul.'
'no water flowing out of imlad morgul, were his words,' said frodo. `we are not in that valley now, and if we came on a spring it would be flowing into it and not out of it.'
'i wouldn't trust it,' said sam, 'not till i was dying of thirst. there's a wicked feeling about this place.' he sniffed. 'and a smell, i fancy. do you notice it? a queer kind of a smell, stuffy. i don't like it.'
'i don't like anything here at all.' said frodo, `step or ston

tarting back and drawing his hand across his mouth.
`it will take days to clear the road like this,' he said. `what's to be done? have those eyes come back? '
`no, not to be seen,' said frodo. `but i still feel that they are looking at me, or thinking about me: making some other plan, perhaps. if this light were lowered, or if it failed, they would quickly come again.'
`trapped in the end! ' said sam bitterly, his anger rising again above weariness and despair. `gnats in a net. may the curse of faramir bite that gollum and bite him quick! '
'that would not help us now,' said frodo. `come! let us see what sting can do. it is an elven-blade. there were webs of horror in the dark ravines of beleriand where it was forged. but you must be the guard and hold back the eyes. here, take the star-glass. do not be afraid. hold it up and watch!'
then frodo stepped up to the great grey net, and hewed it with a wide sweeping stroke, drawing the bitter edge swiftly across a ladder of close-strung cords, and

at the treachery, and desperation at the delay when his master was in deadly peril, gave to sam a sudden violence and strength that was far beyond anything that gollum had expected from this slow stupid hobbit, as he thought him. not gollum himself could have twisted more quickly or more fiercely. his hold on sam's mouth slipped, and sam ducked and lunged forward again, trying to tear away from the grip on his neck. his sword was still in his hand, and on his left arm, hanging by its thong, was faramir's staff. desperately he tried to turn and stab his enemy. but gollum was too quick. his long right arm shot out, and he grabbed sam's wrist: his fingers were like a vice; slowly and relentlessly he bent the hand down and forward, till with a cry of pain sam released the sword and it fell to the ground; and all the while gollum's other hand was tightening on sam's throat.
then sam played his last trick. with all his strength he pulled away and got his feet firmly planted; then suddenly he drove

 to do before the end. i must see it through, sir, if you understand.
`but what can i do? not leave mr. frodo dead, unburied on the top of the mountains, and go home? or go on? go on?' he repeated, and for a moment doubt and fear shook him. `go on? is that what i've got to do? and leave him?'
then at last he began to weep; and going to frodo he composed his body, and folded his cold hands upon his breast, and wrapped his cloak about him; and he laid his own sword at one side, and the staff that faramir had given at the other.
'if i'm to go on,' he said, `then i must take your sword, by your leave, mr. frodo, but i'll put this one to lie by you, as it lay by the old king in the barrow; and you've got your beautiful mithril coat from old mr. bilbo. and your star-glass, mr. frodo, you did lend it to me and i'll need it, for i'll be always in the dark now. it's too good for me, and the lady gave it to you, but maybe she'd understand. do you understand, mr. frodo? i've got to go on.'
but he could
