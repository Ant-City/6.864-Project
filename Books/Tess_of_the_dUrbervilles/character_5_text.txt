the parson rode a step or two nearer.

"it was only my whim," he said; and, after a moment's hesitation: "it
was on account of a discovery i made some little time ago, whilst i
was hunting up pedigrees for the new county history.  i am parson
tringham, the antiquary, of stagfoot lane.  don't you really know,
durbeyfield, that you are the lineal representative of the ancient
and knightly family of the d'urbervilles, who derive their descent
from sir pagan d'urberville, that renowned knight who came from
normandy with william the conqueror, as appears by battle abbey
roll?"

"never heard it before, sir!"

"well it's true.  throw up your chin a moment, so that i may catch
the profile of your face better.  yes, that's the d'urberville nose
and chin--a little debased.  your ancestor was one of the twelve
knights who assisted the lord of estremavilla in normandy in his
conquest of glamorganshire.  branches of

  "however, our impulses are too strong for our
judgement sometimes.  i thought you might perhaps know something of
it all the while."

"well, i have heard once or twice, 'tis true, that my family had seen
better days afore they came to blackmoor.  but i took no notice o't,
thinking it to mean that we had once kept two horses where we now
keep only one.  i've got a wold silver spoon, and a wold graven seal
at home, too; but, lord, what's a spoon and seal? ...  and to think
that i and these noble d'urbervilles were one flesh all the time.
'twas said that my gr't-granfer had secrets, and didn't care to talk
of where he came from...  and where do we raise our smoke, now,
parson, if i may make so bold; i mean, where do we d'urbervilles
live?"

"you don't live anywhere. you are extinct--as a county family."

"that's bad."

"yes--what the mendacious family chronicles call extinct in the male
line--that is, gone down--gone under."

"then where do we lie?"

"at kingsbere-sub-greenhill: rows and rows of you

fred, i don't mind telling you that the secret is that i'm one of a
noble race--it has been just found out by me this present afternoon,
p.m."  and as he made the announcement, durbeyfield, declining from
his sitting position, luxuriously stretched himself out upon the bank
among the daisies.

the lad stood before durbeyfield, and contemplated his length from
crown to toe.

"sir john d'urberville--that's who i am," continued the prostrate
man.  "that is if knights were baronets--which they be.  'tis
recorded in history all about me.  dost know of such a place, lad,
as kingsbere-sub-greenhill?"

"ees.  i've been there to greenhill fair."

"well, under the church of that city there lie--"

"'tisn't a city, the place i mean; leastwise 'twaddn' when i was

"'ssh--don't be so for'ard!" said a shyer girl.

the young man, thus invited, glanced them over, and attempted some
discrimination; but, as the group were all so new to him, he could
not very well exercise it.  he took almost the first that came to
hand, which was not the speaker, as she had expected; nor did it
happen to be tess durbeyfield.  pedigree, ancestral skeletons,
monumental record, the d'urberville lineaments, did not help tess in
her life's battle as yet, even to the extent of attracting to her a
dancing-partner over the heads of the commonest peasantry.  so much
for norman blood unaided by victorian lucre.

the name of the eclipsing girl, whatever it was, has not been handed
down; but she was envied by all as the first who enjoyed the luxury
of a masculine partner that evening.  yet such was the force of

"that wer all a part of the larry!  we've been found to be the
greatest gentlefolk in the whole county--reaching all back long
before oliver grumble's time--to the days of the pagan turks--with
monuments, and vaults, and crests, and 'scutcheons, and the lord
knows what all.  in saint charles's days we was made knights o' the
royal oak, our real name being d'urberville! ...  don't that make
your bosom plim?  'twas on this account that your father rode home
in the vlee; not because he'd been drinking, as people supposed."

"i'm glad of that.  will it do us any good, mother?"

"o yes!  'tis thoughted that great things may come o't.  no doubt a
mampus of volk of our own rank will be down here in their carriages
as soon as 'tis known.  your father learnt it on his way hwome

he was not particularly persistent when they did so coincide.

tess, meanwhile, as the one who had dragged her parents into this
quagmire, was silently wondering what she could do to help them out
of it; and then her mother broached her scheme.

"we must take the ups wi' the downs, tess," said she; "and never
could your high blood have been found out at a more called-for
moment.  you must try your friends.  do ye know that there is a very
rich mrs d'urberville living on the outskirts o' the chase, who must
be our relation?  you must go to her and claim kin, and ask for some
help in our trouble."

"i shouldn't care to do that," says tess.  "if there is such a lady,
'twould be enough for us if she were friendly--not to expect her to
give us help."

"you could win her round to do anything, my dear.  besides, perhaps
there's more in it than you know of. i've heard what i've heard,
good-now."

the oppressive sense of the harm she had done led tess to be m

deferential than she might otherwise have been to the maternal
wish; but she could not understand why her mother should find such
satisfaction in contemplating an enterprise of, to her, such doubtful
profit.  her mother might have made inquiries, and have discovered
that this mrs d'urberville was a lady of unequalled virtues and
charity.  but tess's pride made the part of poor relation one of
particular distaste to her.

"i'd rather try to get work," she murmured.

"durbeyfield, you can settle it," said his wife, turning to where he
sat in the background.  "if you say she ought to go, she will go."

"i don't like my children going and making themselves beholden to
strange kin," murmured he.  "i'm the head of the noblest branch o'
the family, and i ought to live up to it."

and don't go thinking about her making a match for me--it is silly."

"very well said, tess!" observed her father sententiously.

"who said i had such a thought?" asked joan.

"i fancy it is in your mind, mother.  but i'll go."

rising early next day she walked to the hill-town called shaston,
and there took advantage of a van which twice in the week ran from
shaston eastward to chaseborough, passing near trantridge, the parish
in which the vague and mysterious mrs d'urberville had her residence.

tess durbeyfield's route on this memorable morning lay amid the
north-eastern undulations of the vale in which she had been born, and
in which her life had unfolded.  the vale of blackmoor was to her the
world, and its inhabitants the races thereof.  from the gates and
stiles of marlott she had looked down its length in the wondering
days of infancy, and what had been mystery to her then was not
much less than mystery to her now.  she had seen daily from her
chamber-window t

and to help them as much as possible she used, as soon as she left
school, to lend a hand at haymaking or harvesting on neighbouring
farms; or, by preference, at milking or butter-making processes,
which she had learnt when her father had owned cows; and being
deft-fingered it was a kind of work in which she excelled.

every day seemed to throw upon her young shoulders more of the
family burdens, and that tess should be the representative of the
durbeyfields at the d'urberville mansion came as a thing of course.
in this instance it must be admitted that the durbeyfields were
putting their fairest side outward.

she alighted from the van at trantridge cross, and ascended on foot
a hill in the direction of the district known as the chase, on the
borders of which, as she had been informed, mrs d'urberville's seat,
the slopes, would be found.  it was not a manorial home in the
ordinary sense, with fields, and pastures, and a grumbling farmer,
out of whom the owner had to

door being towards her.

simple tess durbeyfield stood at gaze, in a half-alarmed attitude,
on the edge of the gravel sweep.  her feet had brought her onward to
this point before she had quite realized where she was; and now all
was contrary to her expectation.

"i thought we were an old family; but this is all new!" she said, in
her artlessness.  she wished that she had not fallen in so readily
with her mother's plans for "claiming kin," and had endeavoured to
gain assistance nearer home.


the d'urbervilles--or stoke-d'urbervilles, as they at first called
themselves--who owned all this, were a somewhat unusual family to
find in such an old-fashioned part of the country.  parson tringham
had spoken truly when he said that our shambling john durbeyfield was
the only really lineal representative of the old d'urberville family
existing in the county, or near it; he might have added, what he knew
very well, that the stoke-d'urbervilles were no more d'urbervilles of
the true tree then he was himself.

ict; and in doing this he felt the necessity of
recommencing with a name that would not too readily identify him with
the smart tradesman of the past, and that would be less commonplace
than the original bald, stark words.  conning for an hour in the
british museum the pages of works devoted to extinct, half-extinct,
obscured, and ruined families appertaining to the quarter of england
in which he proposed to settle, he considered that _d'urberville_
looked and sounded as well as any of them: and d'urberville
accordingly was annexed to his own name for himself and his heirs
eternally.  yet he was not an extravagant-minded man in this, and in
constructing his family tree on the new basis was duly reasonable in
framing his inter-marriages and aristocratic links, never inserting
a single title above a rank of strict moderation.

of this work of imagination poor tess and her parents were naturally
in ignorance--much to their discomfiture; indeed, the very
possibility of such annexations was unknown to t

he had an almost swarthy complexion, with full lips, badly moulded,
though red and smooth, above which was a well-groomed black moustache
with curled points, though his age could not be more than three- or
four-and-twenty.  despite the touches of barbarism in his contours,
there was a singular force in the gentleman's face, and in his bold
rolling eye.

"well, my beauty, what can i do for you?" said he, coming forward.
and perceiving that she stood quite confounded: "never mind me. i am
mr d'urberville.  have you come to see me or my mother?"

this embodiment of a d'urberville and a namesake differed even more
from what tess had expected than the house and grounds had differed.
she had dreamed of an aged and dignified face, the sublimation of
all the d'urberville lineaments, furrowed with incarnate memories
representing in hieroglyphic the centuries of her family's and
england's history.  but she screwed herself up to the work in hand,
since she could not get out of it, and answered--

being here, her rosy lips curved towards a smile,
much to the attraction of the swarthy alexander.

"it is so very foolish," she stammered; "i fear can't tell you!"

"never mind; i like foolish things.  try again, my dear," said he
kindly.

"mother asked me to come," tess continued; "and, indeed, i was in the
mind to do so myself likewise.  but i did not think it would be like
this.  i came, sir, to tell you that we are of the same family as
you."

"ho!  poor relations?"

"yes."

"stokes?"

"no; d'urbervilles."

"ay, ay; i mean d'urbervilles."

"our names are worn away to durbeyfield; but we have several proofs
that we are d'urbervilles.  antiquarians hold we are,--and--and we
have an old seal, marked with a ramping lion on a shield, and a
castle over him.  and we have a very old silver spoon, round in the
bowl like a little ladle, and marked with the same castle.  but it
is so worn that mother uses it to stir the pea-soup."

"a castle argent is certainly my crest," said he blandly.  "and my

"it is a long while before he returns past trantridge cross.
supposing we walk round the grounds to pass the time, my pretty coz?"

tess wished to abridge her visit as much as possible; but the young
man was pressing, and she consented to accompany him.  he conducted
her about the lawns, and flower-beds, and conservatories; and thence
to the fruit-garden and greenhouses, where he asked her if she liked
strawberries.

"yes," said tess, "when they come."

"they are already here."  d'urberville began gathering specimens
of the fruit for her, handing them back to her as he stooped; and,
presently, selecting a specially fine product of the "british queen"
variety, he stood up and held it by the stem to her mouth.

"no--no!" she said quickly, putting her fingers between his hand and
her lips.  "i would rather take it in my own hand."

"nonsense!" he insisted; and in a slight distress she parted her lips
and took it in.

they had spent some time wandering desultorily thus, tess eating in

a half-pleased, half-reluctant state whatever d'urberville offered
her.  when she could consume no more of the strawberries he filled
her little basket with them; and then the two passed round to the
rose-trees, whence he gathered blossoms and gave her to put in her
bosom. she obeyed like one in a dream, and when she could affix no
more he himself tucked a bud or two into her hat, and heaped her
basket with others in the prodigality of his bounty.  at last,
looking at his watch, he said, "now, by the time you have had
something to eat, it will be time

for you to leave, if you want to
catch the carrier to shaston.  come here, and i'll see what grub i
can find."

stoke d'urberville took her back to the lawn and into the tent, where
he left her, soon reappearing with a basket of light luncheon, which
he put before her himself.  it was evidently the gentleman's wish not
to be disturbed in this pleasant _tête-à-tête_ by the servantry.

"do you mind my smoking?" he asked.

"oh, not at all, sir."

he watched her pretty and unconscious munching through the skeins of
smoke that pervaded the tent, and tess durbeyfield did not divine,
as she innocently looked down at the roses

hat which now jolts us round and along; but such completeness is not
to be prophesied, or even conceived as possible.  enough that in the
present case, as in millions, it was not the two halves of a perfect
whole that confronted each other at the perfect moment; a missing
counterpart wandered independently about the earth waiting in
crass obtuseness till the late time came.  out of which maladroit
delay sprang anxieties, disappointments, shocks, catastrophes, and
passing-strange destinies.

when d'urberville got back to the tent he sat down astride on a
chair, reflecting, with a pleased gleam in his face.  then he broke
into a loud laugh.

"well, i'm damned!  what a funny thing!  ha-ha-ha!  and what a crumby
girl!"

tess went down the hill to trantridge cross, and inattentively waited
to take her seat in the van returning from chaseborough to shaston.
she did not know what the other occupants said to her as she entered,
though she answered them; and when they had started anew she rode

 perceived in a moment from her
mother's triumphant manner that something had occurred in the
interim.

"oh yes; i know all about it!  i told 'ee it would be all right, and
now 'tis proved!"

"since i've been away?  what has?" said tess rather wearily.

her mother surveyed the girl up and down with arch approval, and went
on banteringly: "so you've brought 'em round!"

"how do you know, mother?"

"i've had a letter."

tess then remembered that there would have been time for this.

"they say--mrs d'urberville says--that she wants you to look after a
little fowl-farm which is her hobby.  but this is only her artful way
of getting 'ee there without raising your hopes.  she's going to own
'ee as kin--that's the meaning o't."

"but i didn't see her."

"you zid somebody, i suppose?"

"i saw her son."

"and did he own 'ee?"

"well--he called me coz."

"an' i knew it!  jacky--he called her coz!" cried joan to her
husband.  "well, he spoke to his mother, of course, and she do want
'ee there."

"but i don't 
 
 ___________________________
 
know that i am apt at tending fowls," said the dubious
tess.

"then i don't know who is apt.  you've be'n born in the business, and
brought up in it.  they that be born in a business always know more
about it than any 'prentice.  besides, that's only just a show of
something for you to do, that you midn't feel beholden."

"i don't altogether think i ought to go," said tess thoughtfully.
"who wrote the letter?  will you let me look at it?"

"mrs d'urberville wrote it.  here it is."

the letter was in the third person, and briefly informed mrs
durbeyfield that her daughter's services would be useful to that lady
in the management of her poultry-farm, that a comfortable room would
be provided for her if she could come, and that the wages would be on
a liberal scale if they liked her.

"oh--that's all!" said tess.

"you couldn't expect her to throw her arms round 'ee, an' to kiss and
to coll 'ee all at once."

tess looked out of the window.

"i would

rather not tell you why, mother; indeed, i don't quite know
why."

a week afterwards she came in one evening from an unavailing search
for some light occupation in the immediate neighbourhood.  her idea
had been to get together sufficient money during the summer to
purchase another horse.  hardly had she crossed the threshold before
one of the children danced across the room, saying, "the gentleman's
been here!"

her mother hastened to explain, smiles breaking from every inch of
her person.  mrs d'urberville's son had called on horseback, having
been riding by chance in the direction of marlott.  he had wished
to know, finally, in the name of his mother, if tess could really
come to manage the old lady's fowl-farm or not; the lad who had
hitherto superintended the birds having proved untrustworthy.  "mr
d'urberville says you must be a good girl if you are at all as you
appear; he knows you must be worth your weight in gold.  he is very
much interested in 'ee--truth to tell."

tess seemed for the mo

w it up."

"i don't quite like my children going away from home," said the
haggler.  "as the head of the family, the rest ought to come to me."

"but do let her go, jacky," coaxed his poor witless wife.  "he's
struck wi' her--you can see that. he called her coz!  he'll marry
her, most likely, and make a lady of her; and then she'll be what
her forefathers was."

john durbeyfield had more conceit than energy or health, and this
supposition was pleasant to him.

"well, perhaps that's what young mr d'urberville means," he admitted;
"and sure enough he mid have serious thoughts about improving his
blood by linking on to the old line.  tess, the little rogue!  and
have she really paid 'em a visit to such an end as this?"

meanwhile tess was walking thoughtfully among the gooseberry-bushes
in the garden, and over prince's grave.  when she came in her mother
pursued her advantage.

"well, what be you going to do?" she asked.

"i wish i had seen mrs d'urberville," said tess.

"i think you mid as well settl

etty maid as 'tis, this is a fine
chance!"

tess smiled crossly.

"i hope it is a chance for earning money.  it is no other kind of
chance.  you had better say nothing of that silly sort about parish."

mrs durbeyfield did not promise.  she was not quite sure that she did
not feel proud enough, after the visitor's remarks, to say a good
deal.

thus it was arranged; and the young girl wrote, agreeing to be ready
to set out on any day on which she might be required.  she was duly
informed that mrs d'urberville was glad of her decision, and that a
spring-cart should be sent to meet her and her luggage at the top
of the vale on the day after the morrow, when she must hold herself
prepared to start.  mrs d'urberville's handwriting seemed rather
masculine.

"a cart?" murmured joan durbeyfield doubtingly.  "it might have been
a carriage for her own kin!"

having at last taken her course tess was less restless and
abstracted, going about her business with some self-assurance in the
thought of acquiring ano

let her go till i had found out whether the gentleman
is really a good-hearted young man and choice over her as his
kinswoman."

"yes, you ought, perhaps, to ha' done that," snored sir john.

joan durbeyfield always managed to find consolation somewhere: "well,
as one of the genuine stock, she ought to make her way with 'en, if
she plays her trump card aright.  and if he don't marry her afore he
will after.  for that he's all afire wi' love for her any eye can
see."

"what's her trump card?  her d'urberville blood, you mean?"

"no, stupid; her face--as 'twas mine."

having mounted beside her, alec d'urberville drove rapidly along
the crest of the first hill, chatting compliments to tess as they
went, the cart with her box being left far behind.  rising still, an
immense landscape stretched around them on every side; behind, the
green valley of her birth, before, a gray country of which she knew
nothing except from her first brief visit to trantridge.  thus they
reached the verge of an incl

ions before them.  sometimes a wheel was off
the ground, it seemed, for many yards; sometimes a stone was sent
spinning over the hedge, and flinty sparks from the horse's hoofs
outshone the daylight.  the aspect of the straight road enlarged with
their advance, the two banks dividing like a splitting stick; one
rushing past at each shoulder.

the wind blew through tess's white muslin to her very skin, and her
washed hair flew out behind.  she was determined to show no open
fear, but she clutched d'urberville's rein-arm.

"don't touch my arm!  we shall be thrown out if you do!  hold on
round my waist!"

she grasped his waist, and so they reached the bottom.

"safe, thank god, in spite of your fooling!" said she, her face on
fire.

"tess--fie! that's temper!" said d'urberville.

"'tis truth."

"well, you need not let go your hold of me so thanklessly the moment
you feel yourself our of danger."

she had not considered what she had been doing; whether he were man
or woman, stick or stone, in her invol

untary hold on him.  recovering
her reserve, she sat without replying, and thus they reached the
summit of another declivity.

"now then, again!" said d'urberville.

"no, no!" said tess.  "show more sense, do, please."

"but when people find themselves on one of the highest points in the
county, they must get down again," he retorted.

he loosened rein, and away they went a second time.  d'urberville
turned his face to her as they rocked, and said, in playful raillery:
"now then, put your arms round my waist again, as you did before, my
beauty."

"never!" said tess independently, holding on as well as she could
without touching him.

"let me put one little kiss on those holmberry lips, tess, or even on
that warmed cheek, and i'll stop--on my honour, i will!"

tess, surprised beyond measure, slid farther back still on her seat,
at which he urged the horse anew, and rocked her the more.

"wil

panion.  "so you can go from your word like that, you
young witch, can you?"

"very well," said tess, "i'll not move since you be so determined!
but i--thought you would be kind to me, and protect me, as my
kinsman!"

"kinsman be hanged!  now!"

"but i don't want anybody to kiss me, sir!" she implored, a big
tear beginning to roll down her face, and the corners of her mouth
trembling in her attempts not to cry.  "and i wouldn't ha' come if
i had known!"

he was inexorable, and she sat still, and d'urberville gave her the
kiss of mastery.  no sooner had he done so than she flushed with
shame, took out her handkerchief, and wiped the spot on her cheek
that had been touched by his lips.  his ardour was nettled at the
sight, for the act on her part had been unconsciously done.

"you are mighty sensitive for a cottage girl!" said the young man.

tess made no reply to this remark, of which, indeed, she did not
quite comprehend the drift, unheeding the snub she had administered
by her instinctive rub upon

bury down and wingreen, till she saw, to her consternation,
that there was yet another descent to be undergone.

"you shall be made sorry for that!" he resumed, his injured tone
still remaining, as he flourished the whip anew.  "unless, that is,
you agree willingly to let me do it again, and no handkerchief."

she sighed. "very well, sir!" she said.  "oh--let me get my hat!"

at the moment of speaking her hat had blown off into the road, their
present speed on the upland being by no means slow.  d'urberville
pulled up, and said he would get it for her, but tess was down on the
other side.

she turned back and picked up the article.

"you look prettier with it off, upon my soul, if that's possible," he
said, contemplating her over the back of the vehicle.  "now then, up
again!  what's the matter?"

the hat was in place and tied, but tess had not stepped forward.

"no, sir," she said, revealing the red and ivory of her mouth as her
eye lit in defiant triumph; "not again, if i know it!"

"what--you wo

n't get up beside me?"

"no; i shall walk."

"'tis five or six miles yet to trantridge."

"i don't care if 'tis dozens.  besides, the cart is behind."

"you artful hussy!  now, tell me--didn't you make that hat blow off
on purpose?  i'll swear you did!"

her strategic silence confirmed his suspicion.

then d'urberville cursed and swore at her, and called her everything
he could think of for the trick.  turning the horse suddenly he tried
to drive back upon her, and so hem her in between the gig and the
hedge.  but he could not do this short of injuring her.

"you ought to be ashamed of yourself for using such wicked words!"

scrambled.  "i don't like 'ee at all!  i hate and detest you!  i'll

heartily.

"well, i like you all the better," he said.  "come, let there be
peace.  i'll never do it any more against your will.  my life upon

still tess could not be induced to remount.  she did not, however,
object to his keeping his gig alongside her; and in this manner, at
a slow pace, they advanced towards the village of trantridge.  from
time to time d'urberville exhibited a sort of fierce distress at
the sight of the tramping he had driven her to undertake by his
misdemeanour.  she might in truth have safely trusted him now; but he
had forfeited her confidence for the time, and she kept on the ground
progressing thoughtfully, as if wondering whether it would be wiser
to return home.  her resolve, however, had been taken, and it seemed
vacillating even to childishness to abandon it now, unless for graver
reasons.  how could she face her parents, get bac

rooms were entirely given over to the birds, who walked about them
with a proprietary air, as though the place had been built by
themselves, and not by certain dusty copyholders who now lay east
and west in the churchyard.  the descendants of these bygone owners
felt it almost as a slight to their family when the house which had
so much of their affection, had cost so much of their forefathers'
money, and had been in their possession for several generations
before the d'urbervilles came and built here, was indifferently
turned into a fowl-house by mrs stoke-d'urberville as soon as the
property fell into hand according to law.  "'twas good enough for
christians in grandfather's time," they said.

the garden in which the cottage stood was surrounded by a wall, and
could only be entered through a door.

when tess had occupied herself about an hour the next morning in
altering and improving the arrangements, according to her skilled
ideas as the daughter of a professed poulterer, the door in the wall
opened and a servant in white cap and apron entered.  she had come
from the manor-house.

"mrs d'urberville wants the fowls as usual," she said; but perceiving
that tess did not quite understand, she explained, "mis'ess is a old
lady, and blind."

"blind!" said tess.

almost before her misgiving at the news could find time to shape
itself she took, under her companion's direction, two of the
most beautiful of the hamburghs in her arms, and followed the
maid-servant, who had likewise taken two, to the adjacent mansion,
which, though ornate and imposing, showed traces everywhere on this
side that some

the birds that the two girls had brought in were duly returned to the
yard, and the process was repeated till all the pet cocks and hens
had been submitted to the old woman--hamburghs, bantams, cochins,
brahmas, dorkings, and such other sorts as were in fashion just
then--her perception of each visitor being seldom at fault as she
received the bird upon her knees.

it reminded tess of a confirmation, in which mrs d'urberville was the
bishop, the fowls the young people presented, and herself and the
maid-servant the parson and curate of the parish bringing them up.
at the end of the ceremony mrs d'urberville abruptly asked tess,
wrinkling and twitching her face into undulations, "can you whistle?"

"whistle, ma'am?"

"yes, whistle tunes."

tess could whistle like most other country-girls, though the
accomplishment was one which she did not care to profess in genteel
company.  however, she blandly admitted that such w

"then you will have to practise it every day.  i had a lad who did it
very well, but he has left.  i want you to whistle to my bullfinches;
as i cannot see them, i like to hear them, and we teach 'em airs
that way.  tell her where the cages are, elizabeth.  you must begin
to-morrow, or they will go back in their piping. they have been
neglected these several days."

"mr d'urberville whistled to 'em this morning, ma'am," said
elizabeth.

"he!  pooh!"

the old lady's face creased into furrows of repugnance, and she made
no further reply.

thus the reception of tess by her fancied kinswoman terminated, and
the birds were taken back to their quarters.  the girl's surprise at
mrs d'urberville's manner was not great; for since seeing the size of
the house she had expected no more.  but she was far from being aware
that the old lady had never heard a word of the so-called kinship

.
she gathered that no great affection flowed between the blind woman
and her son.  but in that, too, she was mistaken.  mrs d'urberville
was not the first mother compelled to love her offspring resentfully,
and to be bitterly fond.


in spite of the unpleasant initiation of the day before, tess
inclined to the freedom and novelty of her new position in the
morning when the sun shone, now that she was once installed there;
and she was curious to test her powers in the unexpected direction
asked of her, so as to ascertain her chance of retaining her post.

"does she?  well then--i'll give you a lesson or two."

"oh no, you won't!" said tess, withdrawing towards the door.

"nonsense; i don't want to touch you.  see--i'll stand on this side
of the wire-netting, and you can keep on the other; so you may feel
quite safe.  now, look here; you screw up your lips too harshly.
there 'tis--so."

he suited the action to the word, and whistled a line of "take, o
take those lips away."  but the allusion was lost upon tess.

"now try," said d'urberville.

she attempted to look reserved; her face put on a sculptural
severity.  but he persisted in his demand, and at last, to get rid of
him, she did put up her lips as directed for producing a clear note;
laughing distressfully, however, and then blushing with vexation that
she had laughed.

he encouraged her with "try again!"

tess was quite serious, painfully serious by this time; and she
tried--ultimately and unexpectedly emitting a real round sound.

you meet with any difficulties and want help here, don't go to the
bailiff, come to me."


it was in the economy of this _régime_ that tess durbeyfield had
undertaken to fill a place.  her first day's experiences were fairly
typical of those which followed through many succeeding days.  a
familiarity with alec d'urberville's presence--which that young man
carefully cultivated in her by playful dialogue, and by jestingly
calling her his cousin when they were alone--removed much of her
original shyness of him, without, however, implanting any feeling
which could engender shyness of a new and tenderer kind.  but she was
more pliable under his hands than a mere companionship would have
made her, owing to her unavoidable dependence upon his mother, and,
through that lady's comparative helplessness, upon him.

 found that whistling to the bullfinches in mrs
d'urberville's room was no such onerous business when she had
regained the art, for she had caught from her musical mother numerous
airs that suited those songsters admirably.  a far more satisfactory
time than when she practised in the garden was this whistling by the
cages each morning.  unrestrained by the young man's presence she
threw up her mouth, put her lips near the bars, and piped away in
easeful grace to the attentive listeners.

mrs d'urberville slept in a large four-post bedstead hung with heavy
damask curtains, and the bullfinches occupied the same apartment,
where they flitted about freely at certain hours, and made little
white spots on the furniture and upholstery.  once while tess was at
the window where the cages were ranged, giving her lesson as usual,
she thought she heard a rustling behind the bed.  the old lady was
not present, and turning round the girl had an impression that
the toes of a pair of boots were visible below t

curtains.  thereupon her whistling became so disjointed that the
listener, if such there were, must have discovered her suspicion of
his presence.  she searched the curtains every morning after that,
but never found anybody within them.  alec d'urberville had evidently
thought better of his freak to terrify her by an ambush of that kind.

every village has its idiosyncrasy, its constitution, often its own

about trantridge was marked, and was perhaps symptomatic of the
choice spirit who ruled the slopes in that vicinity.  the place had
also a more abiding defect; it drank hard.  the staple conversation

ached the place, by which time it was close upon dusk.  her
limited marketing was soon completed; and then as usual she began to
look about for some of the trantridge cottagers.

at first she could not find them, and she was informed that most of
them had gone to what they called a private little jig at the house
of a hay-trusser and peat-dealer who had transactions with their
farm.  he lived in an out-of-the-way nook of the townlet, and in
trying to find her course thither her eyes fell upon mr d'urberville
standing at a street corner.

"what--my beauty?  you here so late?" he said.

she told him that she was simply waiting for company homeward.

"i'll see you again," said he over her shoulder as she went on down
the back lane.

approaching the hay-trussers, she could hear the fiddled notes of
a reel proceeding from some building in the rear; but no sound of
dancing was audible--an exceptional state of things for these parts,
where as a rule the stamping drowned the music.  the front door being

later lives, to avoid making odd lots of the single people between

"well, my beauty, what are you doing here?"

she was so tired after her long day and her walk that she confided
her trouble to him--that she had been waiting ever since he saw her
to have their company home, because the road at night was strange to
her.  "but it seems they will never leave off, and i really think i
will wait no longer."

it was a three-mile walk, along a dry white road, made whiter
to-night by the light of the moon.

tess soon perceived as she walked in the flock, sometimes with this
one, sometimes with that, that the fresh night air was producing
staggerings and serpentine courses among the men who had partaken too
freely; some of the more careless women also were wandering in their
gait--to wit, a dark virago, car darch, dubbed queen of spades, till
lately a favourite of d'urberville's; nancy, her sister, nicknamed
the queen of diamonds; and the young married woman who had already
tumbled down.  yet however terrestrial and lumpy their appearance
just now to the mean unglamoured eye, to themselves the case was
different.  they followed the road with a sensation that they were
soaring along in a supporting medium, possessed of original and
profound thoughts, themselves and surrounding nature forming
an organism of which all the parts harmoniously and joyously

she closed her fists and squared up at tess.

"indeed, then, i shall not fight!" said the latter majestically; "and
if i had know you was of that sort, i wouldn't have so let myself
down as to come with such a whorage as this is!"

the rather too inclusive speech brought down a torrent of
vituperation from other quarters upon fair tess's unlucky head,
particularly from the queen of diamonds, who having stood in the
relations to d'urberville that car had also been suspected of, united
with the latter against the common enemy.  several other women also
chimed in, with an animus which none of them would have been so
fatuous as to show but for the rollicking evening they had passed.
thereupon, finding tess unfairly browbeaten, the husbands and lovers
tried to make peace by defending her; but the result of that attempt
was directly to increase the war.

tess was indignant and ashamed.  she no longer minded the loneliness
of the way and

they were all now inside the field, and she was edging back to rush
off alone when a horseman emerged almost silently from the corner of
the hedge that screened the road, and alec d'urberville looked round
upon them.

"what the devil is all this row about, work-folk?" he asked.

the explanation was not readily forthcoming; and, in truth, he did
not require any.  having heard their voices while yet some way off he
had ridden creepingly forward, and learnt enough to satisfy himself.

tess was standing apart from the rest, near the gate.  he bent over
towards her.  "jump up behind me," he whispered, "and we'll get shot
of the screaming cats in a jiffy!"

she felt almost ready to faint,

having buttoned the overcoat round her shoulders he plunged into the
webs of vapour which by this time formed veils between the trees.
she could hear the rustling of the branches as he ascended the
adjoining slope, till his movements were no louder than the hopping
of a bird, and finally died away.  with the setting of the moon the
pale light lessened, and tess became invisible as she fell into
reverie upon the leaves where he had left her.

in the meantime alec d'urberville had pushed on up the slope to clear
his genuine doubt as to the quarter of the chase they were in.  he
had, in fact, ridden quite at random for over an hour, taking any
turning that came to hand in order to prolong companionship with her,
and giving far more attention to tess's moonlit person than to any
wayside object.  a little rest for the jaded animal being desirable,
he did not hasten his search for landmarks.  a clamber over the
hill into the adjoining vale brought him to the fence of a h

whose contours he recognized, which settled the question of their
whereabouts.  d'urberville thereupon turned back; but by this time
the moon had quite gone down, and partly on account of the fog the
chase was wrapped in thick darkness, although morning was not far
off.  he was obliged to advance with outstretched hands to avoid
contact with the boughs, and discovered that to hit the exact spot
from which he had started was at first entirely beyond him.  roaming
up and down, round and round, he at length heard a slight movement of
the horse close at hand; and the sleeve of his overcoat

caught his foot.

"tess!" said d'urberville.

there was no answer.  the obscurity was now so great that he could
see absolutely nothing but a pale nebulousness at his feet, which
represented the white muslin figure he had left upon the dead leaves.
everything else was blackness alike.  d'urberville stooped; and heard
a gentle regular breathing.  he knelt and bent lower, till her breath
warmed his face, and in a moment his cheek was in contact with hers.
she was sleeping soundly, and upon her eyelashes there lingered
tears.

darkness and silence ruled everywhere around.  above them rose the
primeval yews and oaks of the chase, in which there poised gentle
roosting birds in their last nap; and about them stole the hopping
rabbits and hares.  but, might some say, where was tess's guardian

so often the coarse appropriates the finer thus, the wrong man the
woman, the wrong woman the man, many thousand years of analytical
philosophy have failed to explain to our sense of order.  one may,
indeed, admit the possibility of a retribution lurking in the present
catastrophe.  doubtless some of tess d'urberville's mailed ancestors
rollicking home from a fray had dealt the same measure even more
ruthlessly towards peasant girls of their time.  but though to visit
the sins of the fathers upon the children may be a morality good
enough for divinities, it is scorned by average human nature; and it
therefore does not mend the matter.

among each other in their fatalistic way: "it was to be."  there

had shades of difference, despite the amalgamating effects of a
roundabout railway; so that, though less than twenty miles from the
place of her sojourn at trantridge, her native village had seemed a
far-away spot.  the field-folk shut in there traded northward and
westward, travelled, courted, and married northward and westward,
thought northward and westward; those on this side mainly directed
their energies and attention to the east and south.

the incline was the same down which d'urberville had driven her so
wildly on that day in june.  tess went up the remainder of its length
without stopping, and on reaching the edge of the escarpment gazed
over the familiar green world beyond, now half-veiled in mist.  it
was always beautiful from here; it was terribly beautiful to tess
to-day, for since her eyes last fell upon it she had learnt that the
serpent hisses where the sweet birds sing, and her views of life had
been totally changed for her by the lesson.  verily another girl than

ascending by the long white road that tess herself had just laboured
up, she saw a two-wheeled vehicle, beside which walked a man, who
held up his hand to attract her attention.

she obeyed the signal to wait for him with unspeculative repose, and
in a few minutes man and horse stopped beside her.

"why did you slip away by stealth like this?" said d'urberville, with
upbraiding breathlessness; "on a sunday morning, too, when people
were all in bed!  i only discovered it by accident, and i have been
driving like the deuce to overtake you.  just look at the mare.  why
go off like this?  you know that nobody wished to hinder your going.
and how unnecessary it has been for you to toil along on foot, and
encumber yourself with this heavy load!  i have followed like a

her lip lifted slightly, though there was little scorn, as a rule,
in her large and impulsive nature.

"i have said i will not take anything more from you, and i will
not--i cannot!  i should be your creature to go on doing that, and
i won't!"

"one would think you were a princess from your manner, in addition
to a true and original d'urberville--ha! ha!  well, tess, dear, i
can say no more.  i suppose i am a bad fellow--a damn bad fellow.
i was born bad, and i have lived bad, and i shall die bad in all
probability.  but, upon my lost soul, i won't be bad towards you

she said that she did not wish him to drive her further, and they
stopped just under the clump of trees.  d'urberville alighted, and
lifted her down bodily in his arms, afterwards placing her articles
on the ground beside her.  she bowed to him slightly, her eye just
lingering in his; and then she turned to take the parcels for
departure.

alec d'urberville removed his cigar, bent towards her, and said--

"you are not going to turn away like that, dear!  come!"

"if you wish," she answered indifferently.  "see how you've mastered
me!"

she thereupon turned round and lifted her face to his, and remained
like a marble term while he imprinted a kiss upon her cheek--half
perfunctorily, half as if zest had not yet quite died out.  her eyes
vaguely rested upon the remotest trees in the lane while the kiss was
given, as though she were nearly unconscious

kinsfolk was rumoured abroad, if rumour be not too large a word for
a space of a square mile.  in the afternoon several young girls of
marlott, former schoolfellows and acquaintances of tess, called to
see her, arriving dressed in their best starched and ironed, as
became visitors to a person who had made a transcendent conquest (as
they supposed), and sat round the room looking at her with great
curiosity.  for the fact that it was this said thirty-first cousin,
mr d'urberville, who had fallen in love with her, a gentleman
not altogether local, whose reputation as a reckless gallant and
heartbreaker was beginning to spread beyond the immediate boundaries
of trantridge, lent tess's supposed position, by its fearsomeness, a
far higher fascination that it would have exercised if unhazardous.

their interest was so deep that the younger ones whispered when her
back was turned--

it is tess durbeyfield, otherwise d'urberville, somewhat changed--the
same, but not the same; at the present stage of her existence living
as a stranger and an alien here, though it was no strange land that
she was in.  after a long seclusion she had come to a resolve to
undertake outdoor work in her native village, the busiest season of
the year in the agricultural world having arrived, and nothing that
she could do within the house being so remunerative for the time as
harvesting in the fields.

"by experience," says roger ascham, "we find out a short way by
a long wandering."  not seldom that long wandering unfits us for
further travel, and of what use is our experience to us then?  tess
durbeyfield's experience was of this incapacitating kind.  at last
she had learned what to do; but who would now accept her doing?

if before going to the d'urbervilles' she had vigorously moved under
the guidance of sundry gnomic texts and phrases known to her and to
the world in general, no doubt she would never have been imposed on.
but it had not been in tess's power--nor is it in anybody's power--to
feel the whole truth of golden opinions while it is possible to
profit by them.  she--and how many more--might have ironically said
to god with saint augustine: "thou hast counselled a better course
than thou hast permitted."

she had held so aloof of late that her trouble, never generally
known, was nearly forgotten in marlott.  but it became evident to her
that she could never be really comfortable again in a place which
had seen the collapse of her family's attempt to "claim kin"--and,
through her, even closer union--with the rich d'urbervilles.  at
least she could not be comfortable there till long years should have
obliterated her keen consciousness of it.  yet even now tess felt the
pulse of hopeful life still warm within her; she might be happy in
some nook which had no memories.  to escape the past and all that
appertained thereto was to annihilate it, and to do that she would

it was not quite so far off as could have been wished; but it was
probably far enough, her radius of movement and repute having been
so small.  to persons of limited spheres, miles are as geographical
degrees, parishes as counties, counties as provinces and kingdoms.

on one point she was resolved: there should be no more d'urberville
air-castles in the dreams and deeds of her new life.  she would be
the dairymaid tess, and nothing more.  her mother knew tess's feeling
on this point so well, though no words had passed between them on the
subject, that she never alluded to the knightly ancestry now.

yet such is human inconsistency that one of the interests of the
new place to her was the accidental virtues of its lying near her
forefathers' country (for they were not blakemore men, though her
mother was blakemore to the bone

).  the dairy called talbothays,
for which she was bound, stood not remotely from some of the former
estates of the d'urbervilles, near the great family vaults of her
granddames and their powerful husbands.  she would be able to look at
them, and think not only that d'urberville, like babylon, had fallen,
but that the individual innocence of a humble descendant could lapse
as silently.  all the while she wondered if any strange good thing
might come of her being in her ancestral land; and some spirit within
her rose  automatically as the sap in the twigs.  it was unexpected
youth, surging up anew after its temporary check, and bringing with
it hope, and the invincible instinct towards self-delight.

such high contentment with such a slight initial performance as that
of having started towards a means of independent living was a part of
the durbeyfield temperament.  tess really wished to walk uprightly,
while her father did nothing of the kind; but she resembled him in
being content with immediate and small achievements, and in having no
mind for laborious effort towards such petty social advancement as
could alone be effected by a family so heavily handicapped as the
once powerful d'urbervilles were now.

there was, it might be said, the energy of her mother's unexpended
family, as well as the natural energy of tess's years, rekindled
after the experience which had so overwhelmed her for the time. let
the truth be told--women do as a rule live through such humiliations,
and regain their spirits, and again look about them with an
interested eye.  while there's life there's hope is a conviction not
so entirely unknown to the "betrayed" as some amiable theorists would
have us believe.

from her reverie, flung it and all the crowd of floral nobility
impatiently on the ground, in an ebullition of displeasure with
herself for her _niaiserie_, and with a quickening warmth in her
heart of hearts.

how stupid he must think her!  in an access of hunger for his good
opinion she bethought herself of what she had latterly endeavoured to
forget, so unpleasant had been its issues--the identity of her family
with that of the knightly d'urbervilles.  barren attribute as it was,
disastrous as its discovery had been in many ways to her, perhaps
mr clare, as a gentleman and a student of history, would respect
her sufficiently to forget her childish conduct with the lords and
ladies if he knew that those purbeck-marble and alabaster people in
kingsbere church really represented her own lineal forefathers; that
she was no spurious d'urberville, compounded of money and ambition
like those at trantridge, but true d'urberville to the bone.

calvinistic doctrine.

"pernicious!" said mr clare, with genial scorn; and he proceeded to
recount experiences which would show the absurdity of that idea.
he told of wondrous conversions of evil livers of which he had been
the instrument, not only amongst the poor, but amongst the rich and
well-to-do; and he also candidly admitted many failures.

as an instance of the latter, he mentioned the case of a young
upstart squire named d'urberville, living some forty miles off, in
the neighbourhood of trantridge.

"not one of the ancient d'urbervilles of kingsbere and other places?"
asked his son.  "that curiously historic worn-out family with its
ghostly legend of the coach-and-four?"

"o no.  the original d'urbervilles decayed and disappeared sixty
or eighty years ago--at least, i believe so.  this seems to be a
new family which had taken the name; for the credit of the former
knightly line i hope they are spurious, i'm sure.  but it is

little impatience.  "politically i am sceptical as to the virtue of
their being old.  some of the wise even among themselves 'exclaim

dramatically, and even historically, i am tenderly attached to them."

this distinction, though by no means a subtle one, was yet too
subtle for mr clare the elder, and he went on with the story he had
been about to relate; which was that after the death of the senior
so-called d'urberville, the young man developed the most culpable
passions, though he had a blind mother, whose condition should have
made him know better.  a knowledge of his career having come to
the ears of mr clare, when he was in that part of the country
preaching missionary sermons, he boldly took occasion to speak to
the delinquent on his spiritual state.  though he was a stranger,
occupying another's pulpit, he had felt this to be his duty, and
took for his text the words from st luke: "thou fool, this night

"i do," she replied.

"before we get home, mind."

"i'll try."

he said no more then.  as they drove on, the fragment of an old manor
house of caroline date rose against the sky, and was in due course
passed and left behind.

"that," he observed, to entertain her, "is an interesting old
place--one of the several seats which belonged to an ancient norman
family formerly of great influence in this county, the d'urbervilles.
i never pass one of their residences without thinking of them.  there
is something very sad in the extinction of a family of renown, even
if it was fierce, domineering, feudal renown."

"yes," said tess.

they crept along towards a point in the expanse of shade just at hand
at which a feeble light was beginning to assert its presence, a spot
where, by day, a fitful white streak of steam at intervals upon the
dark green background denoted intermittent moments of contact between

to his side.

tess's breath quickened.

"yes, dearest.  never mind."

"i--i--am not a durbeyfield, but a d'urberville--a descendant of the

all gone to nothing!"

"a d'urberville!--indeed!  and is that all the trouble, dear tess?"

"yes," she answered faintly.

"well--why should i love you less after knowing this?"

your name to d'urberville, and trace the manifest corruption.  and
this was the carking secret!"

she had not told.  at the last moment her courage had failed her;
she feared his blame for not telling him sooner; and her instinct
of self-preservation was stronger than her candour.

"of course," continued the unwitting clare, "i should have been glad
to know you to be descended exclusively from the long-suffering,
dumb, unrecorded rank and file of the english nation, and not from

she was agitated.

she found him determined to spend a short time at the wellbridge
flour-mills. and what had determined him?  less the opportunity of an
insight into grinding and bolting than the casual fact that lodgings
were to be obtained in that very farmhouse which, before its
mutilation, had been the mansion of a branch of the d'urberville
family.  this was always how clare settled practical questions; by
a sentiment which had nothing to do with them.  they decided to go
immediately after the wedding, and remain for a fortnight, instead
of journeying to towns and inns.

marriage, but making the best of the matter by saying that, though
a dairywoman was the last daughter-in-law they could have expected,
their son had arrived at an age which he might be supposed to be the
best judge.

this coolness in his relations distressed clare less than it would
have done had he been without the grand card with which he meant to
surprise them ere long.  to produce tess, fresh from the dairy, as
a d'urberville and a lady, he had felt to be temerarious and risky;
hence he had concealed her lineage till such time as, familiarized
with worldly ways by a few months' travel and reading with him, he
could take her on a visit to his parents and impart the knowledge
while triumphantly producing her as worthy of such an ancient line.

observed the build and character of that conveyance for the first

"i fancy you seem oppressed, tessy," said clare.

"yes," she answered, putting her hand to her brow.  "i tremble at
many things.  it is all so serious, angel.  among other things i seem
to have seen this carriage before, to be very well acquainted with
it.  it is very odd--i must have seen it in a dream."

"oh--you have heard the legend of the d'urberville coach--that
well-known superstition of this county about your family when they
were very popular here; and this lumbering old thing reminds you of
it."

"i have never heard of it to my knowledge," said she.  "what is the
legend--may i know it?"

"well--i would rather not tell it in detail just now.  a certain
d'urberville of the sixteenth or seventeenth century committed a
dreadful crime in his family coach; and since that time members of
the family see or hear the old coach whenever--but i'll

"i don't remember hearing it before," she murmured.  "is it when we

when we have committed a crime?"

"now, tess!"

he silenced her by a kiss.

by the time they reached home she was contrite and spiritless.  she
was mrs angel clare, indeed, but had she any moral right to the name?
was she not more truly mrs alexander d'urberville?  could intensity
of love justify what might be considered in upright souls as culpable
reticence?  she knew not what was expected of women in such cases;
and she had no counsellor.

however, when she found herself alone in her room for a few
minutes--the last day this on which she was ever to enter it--she
knelt down and prayed.  she tried to pray to god, but it was her
husband who really had her supplication.  her idolatry of this man
was such that she herself almost feared it to be ill-omene

they drove by the level road along the valley to a distance of a few
miles, and, reaching wellbridge, turned away from the village to the
left, and over the great elizabethan bridge which gives the place
half its name.  immediately behind it stood the house wherein they
had engaged lodgings, whose exterior features are so well known to
all travellers through the froom valley; once portion of a fine
manorial residence, and the property and seat of a d'urberville, but
since its partial demolition a farmhouse.

"welcome to one of your ancestral mansions!" said clare as he handed
her down.  but he regretted the pleasantry; it was too near a satire.

on entering they found that, though they had only engaged a couple
of rooms, the farmer had taken advantage of their proposed presence
during the coming days to pay a new year's visit to some friends,
leaving a woman from a neighbouring cottage to minister to their
few wants.  the absoluteness of possession pl

he had ever come in contact--had pinned her faith to his
success; had prophesied a wondrous career for him.  there had seemed
nothing at all out of keeping with such a conjectured career in the
storing up of these showy ornaments for his wife and the wives of
her descendants.  they gleamed somewhat ironically now.  "yet why?"
he asked himself.  it was but a question of vanity throughout; and
if that were admitted into one side of the equation it should be
admitted into the other.  his wife was a d'urberville: whom could
they become better than her?

suddenly he said with enthusiasm--

"tess, put them on--put them on!"  and he turned from the fire to
help her.

but as if by magic she had already donned them--necklace, ear-rings,
bracelets, and all.

"but the gown isn't right, tess," said clare.  "it ought to be a low
one for a set of brilliants like that."

"ought it?" said tess.

"yes," said he.

brow, and firing the delicate skin underneath.  a large shadow of her
shape rose upon the wall and ceiling.  she bent forward, at which
each diamond on her neck gave a sinister wink like a toad's; and
pressing her forehead against his temple she entered on her story of
her acquaintance with alec d'urberville and its results, murmuring
the words without flinching, and with her eyelids drooping down.

her narrative ended; even its re-assertions and secondary
explanations were done.  tess's voice throughout had hardly risen
higher than its opening tone; there had been no exculpatory phrase of
any kind, and she had not wept.

ore lying down he crept shoeless upstairs, and
listened at the door of her apartment.  her measured breathing told
that she was sleeping profoundly.

"thank god!" murmured clare; and yet he was conscious of a pang of
bitterness at the thought--approximately true, though not wholly
so--that having shifted the burden of her life to his shoulders, she
was now reposing without care.

he turned away to descend; then, irresolute, faced round to her
door again.  in the act he caught sight of one of the d'urberville
dames, whose portrait was immediately over the entrance to tess's
bedchamber.  in the candlelight the painting was more than
unpleasant.  sinister design lurked in the woman's features, a
concentrated purpose of revenge on the other sex--so it seemed to
him then.  the caroline bodice of the portrait was low--precisely as
tess's had been when he tucked it in to show the necklace; and again
he experienced the distressing sensation of a resemblance between
them.

the check was sufficient.  he resu

midnight came and passed silently, for there was nothing to announce
it in the valley of the froom.

not long after one o'clock there was a slight creak in the darkened
farmhouse once the mansion of the d'urbervilles.  tess, who used the
upper chamber, heard it and awoke.  it had come from the corner step
of the staircase, which, as usual, was loosely nailed.  she saw the
door of her bedroom open, and the figure of her husband crossed the
stream of moonlight with a curiously careful tread.  he was in his
shirt and trousers only, and her first flush of joy died when she
perceived that his eyes were fixed in an unnatural stare on vacancy.
when he reached the middle of the room he stood still and murmured in

than i can

that was all she said on the matter.  if tess had been artful, had
she made a scene, fainted, wept hysterically, in that lonely lane,
notwithstanding the fury of fastidiousness with which he was
possessed, he would probably not have withstood her.  but her mood
of long-suffering made his way easy for him, and she herself was
his best advocate.  pride, too, entered into her submission--which
perhaps was a symptom of that reckless acquiescence in chance too
apparent in the whole d'urberville family--and the many effective
chords which she could have stirred by an appeal were left untouched.

the remainder of their discourse was on practical matters only.  he
now handed her a packet containing a fairly good sum of money, which
he had obtained from his bankers for the purpose.  the brilliants,
the interest in which seemed to be tess's for her life only (if he
understood the wording of the will), he advised her to let him send
to a bank for safety; and to this she readily agreed.

to his wife a discussion which had arisen at the
inn about the clergy, originated by the fact of his daughter having
married into a clerical family. "they was formerly styled 'sir',
like my own ancestry," he said, "though nowadays their true style,
strictly speaking, is 'clerk' only."  as tess had wished that no
great publicity should be given to the event, he had mentioned no
particulars.  he hoped she would remove that prohibition soon.  he
proposed that the couple should take tess's own name, d'urberville,
as uncorrupted.  it was better than her husbands's.  he asked if any
letter had come from her that day.

then mrs durbeyfield informed him that no letter had come, but tess
unfortunately had come herself.

when at length the collapse was explained to him, a sullen
mortification, not usual with durbeyfield, overpowered the influence
of the cheering glass.  yet the intrinsic quality of the event moved
his touchy sensitiveness less than its conjectured effect upon the
minds of others.

earnestly appeal to them as fellow-man to fellow-men, and ask them

his mood transmuted itself into a dogged indifference till at length
he fancied he was looking on his own existence with the passive
interest of an outsider.

he was embittered by the conviction that all this desolation had been
brought about by the accident of her being a d'urberville.  when he
found that tess came of that exhausted ancient line, and was not of
the new tribes from below, as he had fondly dreamed, why had he not
stoically abandoned her in fidelity to his principles?  this was what
he had got by apostasy, and his punishment was deserved.

then he became weary and anxious, and his anxiety increased.  he
wondered if he had treated her unfairly.  he ate without knowing that
he ate, and drank without tasting.  as the hours dropped past, as the

the top of a hill down which the lane stretched its serpentine length
in glimpses, when she heard footsteps behind her back, and in a few
moments she was overtaken by a man.  he stepped up alongside tess and
said--

"good night, my pretty maid": to which she civilly replied.

the light still remaining in the sky lit up her face, though the
landscape was nearly dark.  the man turned and stared hard at her.

"why, surely, it is the young wench who was at trantridge awhile--
young squire d'urberville's friend?  i was there at that time, though
i don't live there now."

she recognized in him the well-to-do boor whom angel had knocked down
at the inn for addressing her coarsely.  a spasm of anguish shot
through her, and she returned him no answer.

"be honest enough to own it, and that what i said in the town was
true, though your fancy-man was so up about it--hey, my sly one?  you
ought to beg my pardon for that blow of his, considering."

still no answer came from tess.  there seemed only o

was given to the central figure, who stood upon some sacks of corn,
facing the people and the door.  the three o'clock sun shone full
upon him, and the strange enervating conviction that her seducer
confronted her, which had been gaining ground in tess ever since she
had heard his words distinctly, was at last established as a fact
indeed.

the rencounter came at a heavy moment, one of all moments calculated
to permit its impact with the least emotional shock.  but such was
unreasoning memory that, though he stood there openly and palpably a
converted man, who was sorrowing for his past irregularities, a fear
overcame her, paralyzing her movement so that she neither retreated
nor advanced.

the lineaments, as such, seemed to complain.  they had been diverted
from their hereditary connotation to signify impressions for which
nature did not intend them.  strange that their very elevation was a
misapplication, that to raise seemed to falsify.

yet could it be so?  she would admit the ungenerous sentiment no
longer.  d'urberville was not the first wicked man who had turned
away from his wickedness to save his soul alive, and why should she
deem it unnatural in him?  it was but the usage of thought which had
been jarred in her at hearing good new words in bad old notes.  the
greater the sinner, the greater the saint; it was not necessary to
dive far into christian history to discover that.

such impressions as these moved her vaguely, and without strict
definiteness.  as soon as the nerveless pause of her surprise would

wished not to encounter alone on this side of the grave.

there was not much time, however, for thought or elusion, and she
yielded as calmly as she could to the necessity of letting him
overtake her.  she saw that he was excited, less by the speed of his
walk than by the feelings within him.

"tess!" he said.

she slackened speed without looking round.

"tess!" he repeated.  "it is i--alec d'urberville."

she then looked back at him, and he came up.

"i see it is," she answered coldly.

"well--is that all?  yet i deserve no more!  of course," he added,
with a slight laugh, "there is something of the ridiculous to your
eyes in seeing me like this.  but--i must put up with that. ...  i

he drew from his pocket a small book, between the leaves of which
was folded a letter, worn and soiled, as from much re-reading.
d'urberville opened the letter.  it was dated several months before
this time, and was signed by parson clare.

the letter began by expressing the writer's unfeigned joy at
d'urberville's conversion, and thanked him for his kindness in
communicating with the parson on the subject.  it expressed mr
clare's warm assurance of forgiveness for d'urberville's former
conduct and his interest in the young man's plans for the future.
he, mr clare, would much have liked to see d'urberville in the church
to whose ministry he had devoted so many years of his own life, and
would have helped him to enter a theological college to that end; but
since his correspondent had possibly not cared to do this on account
of the delay it would have entailed, he was not the man to insist
upon its paramount importance.  every man must work as he could best

perceived to be a man in black, arriving from the direction of
flintcomb-ash.  the man at the slicer, having nothing else to do with
his eyes, continually observed the comer, but tess, who was occupied,
did not perceive him till her companion directed her attention to his
approach.

it was not her hard taskmaster, farmer groby; it was one in a
semi-clerical costume, who now represented what had once been the
free-and-easy alec d'urberville.  not being hot at his preaching
there was less enthusiasm about him now, and the presence of the
grinder seemed to embarrass him.  a pale distress was already on
tess's face, and she pulled her curtained hood further over it.

d'urberville came up and said quietly--

"i want to speak to you, tess."

"you have refused my last request, not to come near me!" said she.

"yes, but i have a good reason."

"well, tell it."

"it is more serious than you may think."

distance from the man who turned the slicer, and the movement of the
machine, too, sufficiently prevented alec's words reaching other
ears.  d'urberville placed himself so as to screen tess from the
labourer, turning his back to the latter.

"it is this," he continued, with capricious compunction.  "in
thinking of your soul and mine when we last met, i neglected to
inquire as to your worldly condition.  you were well dressed, and i
did not think of it.  but i see now that it is hard--harder than it
used to be when i--knew you--harder than you deserve.  perhaps a good
deal of it is owning to me!"

she did not answer, and he watched her inquiringl

parents to bring up their girls in such dangerous ignorance of the
gins and nets that the wicked may set for them, whether their motive

tess still did no more than listen, throwing down one globular root
and taking up another with automatic regularity, the pensive contour
of the mere fieldwoman alone marking her.

"but it is not that i came to say," d'urberville went on.  "my
circumstances are these.  i have lost my mother since you were at
trantridge, and the place is my own.  but i intend to sell it, and
devote myself to missionary work in africa.  a devil of a poor hand
i shall make at the trade, no doubt.  however, what i want to ask
you is, will you put it in my power to do my duty--to make the only
reparation i can make for the trick played you: that is, will you be

he drew a piece of parchment from his pocket, with a slight fumbling
of embarrassment.

"what is it?" said she.

"a marriage licence."

"o no, sir--no!" she said quickly, starting back.

"you will not?  why is that?"

and as he asked the question a disappointment which was not entirely
the disappointment of thwarted duty crossed d'urberville's face.  it
was unmistakably a symptom that something of his old passion for her
had been revived; duty and desire ran hand-in-hand.

"surely," he began again, in more impetuous tones, and then looked
round at the labourer who turned the slicer.

tess, too, felt that the argument could not be ended there.

wished to walk a little way, she moved off with d'urberville across
the zebra-striped field.  when they reached the first

a pattering of hoofs on the soil of the field, which they had not
noticed in their preoccupation, ceased close behind them; and a voice
reached her ear:

"what the devil are you doing away from your work at this time o'
day?"

farmer groby had espied the two figures from the distance, and had
inquisitively ridden across, to learn what was their business in his
field.

"don't speak like that to her!" said d'urberville, his face
blackening with something that was not christianity.

"indeed, mister!  and what mid methodist pa'sons have to do with
she?"

"who is the fellow?" asked d'urberville, turning to tess.

she went close up to him.

"go--i do beg you!" she said.

"what!  and leave you to that tyrant?  i can see in his face what a
churl he is."

"he won't hurt me.  he's not in love with me.  i can leave at
lady-day."

"well, i have no right but to obey, i suppose.  but--well, goodbye!"

her defender, whom

was a general exodus in the
direction of the town, which lay at a distance of from ten to a dozen
miles over hilly country.  though tess also meant to leave at the
quarter-day, she was one of the few who did not go to the fair,
having a vaguely-shaped hope that something would happen to render
another outdoor engagement unnecessary.

it was a peaceful february day, of wonderful softness for the time,
and one would almost have thought that winter was over.  she had
hardly finished her dinner when d'urberville's figure darkened the
window of the cottage wherein she was a lodger, which she had all to
herself to-day.

tess jumped up, but her visitor had knocked at the door, and she
could hardly in reason run away.  d'urberville's knock, his walk up
to the door, had some indescribable quality of difference from his
air when she last saw him.  they seemed to be acts of which the doer
was ashamed.  she thought that she would not open the door; but, as
there was no sense in that either, she arose, and havi

eve in these matters, tess?" he asked.  "you seem to have no
religion--perhaps owing to me."

"but i have.  though i don't believe in anything supernatural."

d'urberville looked at her with misgiving.

"then do you think that the line i take is all wrong?"

"a good deal of it."

"h'm--and yet i've felt so sure about it," he said uneasily.

"i believe in the spirit of the sermon on the mount, and so did my
dear husband...  but i don't believe--"

here she gave her negations.

"the fact is," said d'urberville drily, "whatever your dear husband
believed you accept, and whatever he rejected you reject, without the
least inquiry or reasoning on your own part.  that's just like you
women.  your mind is enslaved to his."

"ah, because he knew everything!" said she, with a triumphant
simplicity of faith in angel clare that the most perfect man could
hardly have deserved, much less her husband.

"yes, but you should not take negative opinions wholesale from
another person like that.  a pretty fellow he mus
 
 ___________________________
 
looked into doctrines at all."

"what used he to say?  he must have said something?"

she reflected; and with her acute memory for the letter of angel
clare's remarks, even when she did not comprehend their spirit, she
recalled a merciless polemical syllogism that she had heard him
use when, as it occasionally happened, he indulged in a species of
thinking aloud with her at his side.  in delivering it she gave also
clare's accent and manner with reverential faithfulness.

"say that again," asked d'urberville, who had listened with the
greatest attention.

she repeated the argument, and d'urberville thoughtfully murmured the
words after her.

"anything else?" he presently asked.

"he said at another time something like this"; and she gave another,
which might possibly have been paralleled in many a work of the
pedigree ranging from the _dictionnaire philosophique_ to huxley's
_essays_.

"ah--ha!  how do you remember them?"

"i wanted to believe what he believed, though he didn't wish me to;
and i ma

suddenly leave off preaching it, and give way to my passion for you."

"how?"

"why," he said aridly; "i have come all the way here to see you
to-day!  but i started from home to go to casterbridge fair, where
i have undertaken to preach the word from a waggon at half-past two
this afternoon, and where all the brethren are expecting me this
minute.  here's the announcement."

he drew from his breast-pocket a poster whereon was printed the day,
hour, and place of meeting, at which he, d'urberville, would preach
the gospel as aforesaid.

"but how can you get there?" said tess, looking at the clock.

"i cannot get there!  i have come here."

"what, you have really arranged to preach, and--"

"i have arranged to preach, and i shall not be there--by reason of my
burning desire to see a woman whom i once despised!--no, by my word
and truth, i never despised you; if i had i should not love you now!
why i did not despise you was on account of your being unsmirched in
spite of all; you withdrew

yourself from me so quickly and resolutely
when you saw the situation; you did not remain at my pleasure; so
there was one petticoat in the world for whom i had no contempt,
and you are she.  but you may well despise me now!  i thought i
worshipped on the mountains, but i find i still serve in the groves!
ha! ha!"

"o alec d'urberville! what does this mean?  what have i done!"

"done?" he said, with a soulless sneer in the word.  "nothing
intentionally.  but you have been the means--the innocent means--of
my backsliding, as they call it.  i ask myself, am i, indeed, one of
those 'servants of corruption' who, 'after they have escaped the
pollutions of the world, are again entangled therein and overcome'--
whose latter end is worse than their beginning?"  he laid his hand on
her shoulder.  "tess, my girl, i was on the way to, a

asp, tessy--one!  only for old friendship--"

"i am without defence. alec!  a good man's honour is in my keeping--
think--be ashamed!"

"pooh!  well, yes--yes!"

he clenched his lips, mortified with himself for his weakness.  his
eyes were equally barren of worldly and religious faith.  the corpses
of those old fitful passions which had lain inanimate amid the lines
of his face ever since his reformation seemed to wake and come
together as in a resurrection.  he went out indeterminately.

though d'urberville had declared that this breach of his engagement
to-day was the simple backsliding of a believer, tess's words, as
echoed from angel clare, had made a deep impression upon him, and
continued to do so after he had left her.  he moved on in silence, as
if his energies were benumbed by the hitherto undreamt-of possibility
that his position was untenable.  reason had had nothing to do with
his whimsical conversion, which was perhaps the mere freak of a
careless man in search of a new sensation, and

y her appetite; and marian was thinking of inducing tess
to descend by a ladder on the further side of the stack when the
gentleman came forward and looked up.

tess uttered a short little "oh!"  and a moment after she said,
quickly, "i shall eat my dinner here--right on the rick."

sometimes, when they were so far from their cottages, they all did
this; but as there was rather a keen wind going to-day, marian and
the rest descended, and sat under the straw-stack.

the newcomer was, indeed, alec d'urberville, the late evangelist,
despite his changed attire and aspect.  it was obvious at a glance
that the original _weltlust_ had come back; that he had restored
himself, as nearly as a man could do who had grown three or four
years older, to the old jaunty, slapdash guise under which tess
had first known her admirer, and cousin so-called.  having decided
to remain where she was, tess sat down among the bundles, out of
sight of the ground, and began her meal; till, by-and-by, she heard
footsteps on the
 
 ___________________________
 
 ladder, and immediately after alec appeared upon the
stack--now an oblong and level platform of sheaves.  he strode across
them, and sat down opposite of her without a word.

tess continued to eat her modest dinner, a slice of thick pancake
which she had brought with her.  the other workfolk were by this
time all gathered under the rick, where the loose straw formed a
comfortable retreat.

"i am here again, as you see," said d'urberville.

"why do you trouble me so!" she cried, reproach flashing from her
very finger-ends.

"i trouble you?  i think i may ask, why do you trouble me?"

"sure, i don't trouble you any-when!"

"you say you don't?  but you do!  you haunt me.  those very eyes that
you turned upon me with such a bitter flash a moment ago, they come
to me just as you showed them then, in the night and in the day!
tess, ever since you told me of that child of ours, it is just as if
my feelings, which have been flowing in

a strong puritanical stream,
had suddenly found a way open in the direction of you, and had all at
once gushed through.  the religious channel is left dry forthwith;
and it is you who have done it!"

she gazed in silence.

"what--you have given up your preaching entirely?" she asked.  she
had gathered from angel sufficient of the incredulity of modern
thought to despise flash enthusiasm; but, as a woman, she was
somewhat appalled.

in affected severity d'urberville continued--

"entirely.  i have broken every engagement since that afternoon i was
to address the drunkards at casterbridge fair.  the deuce only knows
what i am thought of by the brethren.  ah-ha!  the brethren!  no
doubt they pray for me--weep for me; for they are kind people in
their way.  but what do i care?  how could i go on with the thing
when i had lost my faith in it?--it would have been hypocrisy of
the basest kind!  among them i should have stood like hymenaeus and
alexander, who wer

 to keep out of danger."
he regarded her silently for a few moments, and with a short cynical
laugh resumed: "i believe that if the bachelor-apostle, whose deputy
i thought i was, had been tempted by such a pretty face, he would
have let go the plough for her sake as i do!"

tess attempted to expostulate, but at this juncture all her fluency
failed her, and without heeding he added:

"well, this paradise that you supply is perhaps as good as any other,
after all.  but to speak seriously, tess."  d'urberville rose and
came nearer, reclining sideways amid the sheaves, and resting upon
his elbow.  "since i last saw you, i have been thinking of what
you said that he said.  i have come to the conclusion that there
does seem rather a want of common-sense in these threadbare old
propositions; how i could have been so fired by poor parson clare's
enthusiasm, and have gone so madly to work, transcending even him, i
cannot make out!  as for what you said last time, on the strength of
your wonderful husband's

ingratitude, and he stepped
across to her side and held her by the shoulders, so that she shook
under his grasp.  "remember, my lady, i was your master once!  i will
be your master again.  if you are any man's wife you are mine!"

the threshers now began to stir below.

"so much for our quarrel," he said, letting her go.  "now i shall
leave you, and shall come again for your answer during the afternoon.
you don't know me yet!  but i know you."

she had not spoken again, remaining as if stunned.  d'urberville
retreated over the sheaves, and descended the ladder, while the
workers below rose and stretched their arms, and shook down the beer
they had drunk.  then the threshing-machine started afresh; and amid
the renewed rustle of the straw tess resumed her position by the
buzzing drum as one in a dream, untying sheaf after sheaf in endless
succession.

in the afternoon the farmer made it known that the rick was to be
finished that night, since there was a moon by which they could see
to wo

rk, and the man with the engine was engaged for another farm on
the morrow.  hence the twanging and humming and rustling proceeded
with even less intermission than usual.

it was not till "nammet"-time, about three o-clock, that tess raised
her eyes and gave a momentary glance round.  she felt but little
surprise at seeing that alec d'urberville had come back, and was
standing under the hedge by the gate.  he had seen her lift her
eyes, and waved his hand urbanely to her, while he blew her a kiss.
it meant that their quarrel was over.  tess looked down again, and
carefully abstained from gazing in that direction.

thus the afternoon dragged on.  the wheat-rick shrank lower, and the
straw-rick grew higher, and the corn-sacks were carted away.  at six
o'clock the wheat-rick was about shoulder-high from the ground.  but
the unthreshed she

huett tell her from below that her hair was tumbling down.

by degrees the freshest among them began to grow cadaverous and
saucer-eyed.  whenever tess lifted her head she beheld always the
great upgrown straw-stack, with the men in shirt-sleeves upon it,
against the gray north sky; in front of it the long red elevator
like a jacob's ladder, on which a perpetual stream of threshed straw
ascended, a yellow river running uphill, and spouting out on the top
of the rick.

she knew that alec d'urberville was still on the scene, observing
her from some point or other, though she could not say where.  there
was an excuse for his remaining, for when the threshed rick drew
near its final sheaves a little ratting was always done, and men
unconnected with the threshing sometimes dropped in for that
performance--sporting characters of all descriptions, gents with
terriers and facetious pipes, roughs with sticks and stones.

but there was another hour's work before the layer of live rats at
the base of

 for the
last hour or two marian had felt uneasy about tess, whom she could
not get near enough to speak to, the other women having kept up their
strength by drinking ale, and tess having done without it through
traditionary dread, owing to its results at her home in childhood.
but tess still kept going: if she could not fill her part she would
have to leave; and this contingency, which she would have regarded
with equanimity and even with relief a month or two earlier, had
become a terror since d'urberville had begun to hover round her.

the sheaf-pitchers and feeders had now worked the rick so low that
people on the ground could talk to them.  to tess's surprise farmer
groby came up on the machine to her, and said that if she desired to
join her friend he did not wish her to keep on any longer, and would
send somebody else to take her place.  the "friend" was d'urberville,
she knew, and also that this concession had been granted in obedience
to the request of that friend, or enemy.  she shook her

"have you seen 'em lately?" she quickly inquired.

"yes.  they didn't know where you were.  it was only by chance that i
found you here."

the cold moon looked aslant upon tess's fagged face between the twigs
of the garden-hedge as she paused outside the cottage which was her
temporary home, d'urberville pausing beside her.

"don't mention my little brothers and sisters--don't make me break
down quite!" she said.  "if you want to help them--god knows they
need it--do it without telling me.  but no, no!" she cried.  "i will
take nothing from you, either for them or for me!"

he did not accompany her further, since, as she lived with the
household, all was public indoors.  no sooner had she herself
entered, laved herself in a washing-tub, and shared supper with the
family than she fell into thoug

rness itself when compared with the universal harshness out
of which they grow; the harshness of the position towards the
temperament, of the means towards the aims, of to-day towards
yesterday, of hereafter towards to-day.

the historic interest of her family--that masterful line of
d'urbervilles--whom he had despised as a spent force, touched his
sentiments now.  why had he not known the difference between the
political value and the imaginative value of these things?  in
the latter aspect her d'urberville descent was a fact of great
dimensions; worthless to economics, it was a most useful ingredient
to the dreamer, to the moralizer on declines and falls.  it was a
fact that would soon be forgotten--that bit of distinction in poor
tess's blood and name, and oblivion would fall upon her hereditary
link with the marble monuments and leaded skeletons at kingsbere.  so
does time ruthlessly destroy his own romances.  in recalling her face
again and again, he thought now that he could see therein a fla

 that he had not
been there when it was broad daylight, and that she did not know
him as any one of the marlott labourers, which was no wonder, her
absences having been so long and frequent of late years.  by-and-by
he dug so close to her that the fire-beams were reflected as
distinctly from the steel prongs of his fork as from her own.  on
going up to the fire to throw a pitch of dead weeds upon it, she
found that he did the same on the other side. the fire flared up,
and she beheld the face of d'urberville.

the unexpectedness of his presence, the grotesqueness of his
appearance in a gathered smockfrock, such as was now worn only by the
most old-fashioned of the labourers, had a ghastly comicality that
chilled her as to its bearing.  d'urberville emitted a low, long
laugh.

"if i were inclined to joke, i should say, how much this seems like
paradise!" he remarked whimsically, looking at her with an inclined
head.

"what do you say?" she weakly asked.

"a jester might say this is just like paradis

s and sisters," he resumed. "i've
been thinking of them."

tess's heart quivered--he was touching her in a weak place.  he had
divined her chief anxiety.  since returning home her soul had gone
out to those children with an affection that was passionate.

"if your mother does not recover, somebody ought to do something for
them; since your father will not be able to do much, i suppose?"

"he can with my assistance.  he must!"

"and with mine."

"no, sir!"

"how damned foolish this is!" burst out d'urberville.  "why, he
thinks we are the same family; and will be quite satisfied!"

"he don't.  i've undeceived him."

"the more fool you!"

d'urberville in anger retreated from her to the hedge, where he
pulled off the long smockfrock which had disguised him; and rolling
it up and pushing it into the couch-fire, went away.

tess could not get on with her digging after this; she felt restless;
she wondered if he had gone back to her father's house; and taking
the fork in her hand proceeded homewards.

personal achievements, or perhaps it would not have had much. it
was the last of the three lives for whose duration the house and
premises were held under a lease; and it had long been coveted by the
tenant-farmer for his regular labourers, who were stinted in cottage
accommodation.  moreover, "liviers" were disapproved of in villages
almost as much as little freeholders, because of their independence
of manner, and when a lease determined it was never renewed.

thus the durbeyfields, once d'urbervilles, saw descending upon them
the destiny which, no doubt, when they were among the olympians of
the county, they had caused to descend many a time, and severely
enough, upon the heads of such landless ones as they themselves were
now.  so do flux and reflux--the rhythm of change--alternate and
persist in everything under the sky.

note of a man in a white mackintosh whom she saw riding down the
street.  possibly it was owing to her face being near to the pane
that he saw her so quickly, and directed his horse so close to the
cottage-front that his hoofs were almost upon the narrow border for
plants growing under the wall.  it was not till he touched the window
with his riding-crop that she observed him.  the rain had nearly
ceased, and she opened the casement in obedience to his gesture.

"didn't you see me?" asked d'urberville.

"i was not attending," she said.  "i heard you, i believe, though i
fancied it was a carriage and horses. i was in a sort of dream."

"ah! you heard the d'urberville coach, perhaps.  you know the legend,
i suppose?"

"no.  my--somebody was going to tell it me once, but didn't."

"if you are a genuine d'urberville i ought not to tell you either,
i suppose.  as for me, i'm a sham one, so it doesn't matter.  it is
rather dismal.  it is that this sound of a non-existent coach can

carrying her off, and in the struggle he killed her--or she killed

if you won't believe it.  come to this cottage of mine. we'll get
up a regular colony of fowls, and your mother can attend to them
excellently; and the children can go to school."

tess breathed more and more quickly, and at length she said--

"how do i know that you would do all this?  your views may
change--and then--we should be--my mother would be--homeless
again."

"o no--no.  i would guarantee you against such as that in writing, if
necessary.  think it over."

tess shook her head.  but d'urberville persisted; she had seldom seen
him so determined; he would not take a negative.

"please just tell your mother," he said, in emphatic tones.  "it is
her business to judge--not yours.  i shall get the house swept out
and whitened to-morrow morning, and fires lit; and it will be dry by
the evening, so that you can come straight there.  now mind, i shall
expect you."

tess again shook her head, her throat swelling with complicated
emotion.  she could not look up at d'urberville.

"i owe you someth

"no, no!--i know you didn't do it on purpose.  well i shall expect
you, or your mother and children at least."

"i shall not come--i have plenty of money!" she cried.

"where?"

"at my father-in-law's, if i ask for it."

"if you ask for it.  but you won't, tess; i know you; you'll never
ask for it--you'll starve first!"

with these words he rode off.  just at the corner of the street he
met the man with the paint-pot, who asked him if he had deserted the
brethren.

"you go to the devil!" said d'urberville.

tess remained where she was a long while, till a sudden rebellious
sense of injustice caused the region of her eyes to swell with the
rush of hot tears thither.  her husband, angel clare himself, had,
like others, dealt out hard measure to her; surely he had!  she had
never before admitted such a thought; but he had surely!  never
in her life--she could swear it from the bottom of her soul--had
she ever intended to do wrong; yet these hard judgements had
come.  whatever her sins, they were no

ed it.  though they
had started so early, it was quite late in the afternoon when they
turned the flank of an eminence which formed part of the upland
called greenhill.  while the horses stood to stale and breathe
themselves tess looked around.  under the hill, and just ahead of
them, was the half-dead townlet of their pilgrimage, kingsbere,
where lay those ancestors of whom her father had spoken and sung to
painfulness: kingsbere, the spot of all spots in the world which
could be considered the d'urbervilles' home, since they had resided
there for full five hundred years.

a man could be seen advancing from the outskirts towards them, and
when he beheld the nature of their waggon-load he quickened his
steps.

"you be the woman they call mrs durbeyfield, i reckon?" he said to
tess's mother, who had descended to walk the remainder of the way.

she nodded.  "though widow of the late sir john d'urberville, poor
nobleman, if i cared for my rights; and returning to the domain of
his forefathers."

 invidiously upon the crocks and
kettles, upon the bunches of dried herbs shivering in the breeze,
upon the brass handles of the dresser, upon the wicker-cradle they
had all been rocked in, and upon the well-rubbed clock-case, all of
which gave out the reproachful gleam of indoor articles abandoned to
the vicissitudes of a roofless exposure for which they were never
made.  round about were deparked hills and slopes--now cut up
into little paddocks--and the green foundations that showed where
the d'urberville mansion once had stood; also an outlying stretch
of egdon heath that had always belonged to the estate.  hard by,
the aisle of the church called the d'urberville aisle looked on
imperturbably.

"isn't your family vault your own freehold?" said tess's mother, as
she returned from a reconnoitre of the church and graveyard.  "why,
of course 'tis, and that's where we will camp, girls, till the place
of your ancestors finds us a roof!  now, tess and 'liza and abraham,
you help me.  we'll make a nest
 
 ___________________________
 
 for these children, and then we'll
have another look round."

tess listlessly lent a hand, and in a quarter of an hour the old
four-post bedstead was dissociated from the heap of goods, and
erected under the south wall of the church, the part of the building
known as the d'urberville aisle, beneath which the huge vaults lay.
over the tester of the bedstead was a beautiful traceried window, of
many lights, its date being the fifteenth century.  it was called
the d'urberville window, and in the upper part could be discerned
heraldic emblems like those on durbeyfield's old seal and spoon.

joan drew the curtains round the bed so as to make an excellent tent
of it, and put the smaller children inside.  "if it comes to the
worst we can sleep there too, for one night," she said.  "but let us
try further on, and get something for the dears to eat!  o, tess,
what's the use of your playing at marrying gentlemen, if it leaves
us like this!"

accompanied by 'liza-lu and the

boy, she again ascended the little
lane which secluded the church from the townlet.  as soon as they got
into the street they beheld a man on horseback gazing up and down.
"ah--i'm looking for you!" he said, riding up to them.  "this is
indeed a family gathering on the historic spot!"

it was alec d'urberville.  "where is tess?" he asked.

personally joan had no liking for alec.  she cursorily signified the
direction of the church, and went on, d'urberville saying that he
would see them again, in case they should be still unsuccessful in
their search for shelter, of which he had just heard.  when they had
gone, d'urberville rode to the inn, and shortly after came out on
foot.

in the interim tess, left with the children inside the bedstead,
remained talking with them awhile, till, seeing that no more could
be done to make them comfortable just then, she walked about the
churchyard, now beginning to be embrowned by the shades of nightfall.

dstead stood were the tombs of
the family, covering in their dates several centuries.  they were
canopied, altar-shaped, and plain; their carvings being defaced
and broken; their brasses torn from the matrices, the rivet-holes
remaining like martin-holes in a sandcliff.  of all the reminders
that she had ever received that her people were socially extinct,
there was none so forcible as this spoliation.

she drew near to a dark stone on which was inscribed:


   ostium sepulchri antiquae familiae d'urberville


tess did not read church-latin like a cardinal, but she knew that
this was the door of her ancestral sepulchre, and that the tall
knights of whom her father had chanted in his cups lay inside.

she musingly turned to withdraw, passing near an altar-tomb, the
oldest of them all, on which was a recumbent figure.  in the dusk she
had not noticed it before, and would hardly have noticed it now but
for an odd fancy that the effigy moved.  as soon as she drew close
to it she discovered all in a mom

he leapt off the slab and supported her.

"i saw you come in," he said smiling, "and got up there not to
interrupt your meditations.  a family gathering, is it not, with
these old fellows under us here?  listen."

he stamped with his heel heavily on the floor; whereupon there arose
a hollow echo from below.

"that shook them a bit, i'll warrant!" he continued.  "and you
thought i was the mere stone reproduction of one of them.  but no.

"go away!" she murmured.

"i will--i'll look for your mother," said he blandly.  but in passing
her he whispered: "mind this; you'll be civil yet!"

when he was gone she bent down upon the entrance to the vaults, and
said--

"why am i on the wrong side of this door!"

benvill lane soon stretched before him, its hedges and trees purple
with buds; but he was looking at other things, and only recalled
himself to the scene sufficiently to enable him to keep the way.  in
something less than an hour-and-a-half he had skirted the south of
the king's hintock estates and ascended to the untoward solitude of
cross-in-hand, the unholy stone whereon tess had been compelled by
alec d'urberville, in his whim of reformation, to swear the strange
oath that she would never wilfully tempt him again.  the pale and
blasted nettle-stems of the preceding year even now lingered nakedly
in the banks, young green nettles of the present spring growing from
their roots.

thence he went along the verge of the upland overhanging the other
hintocks, and, turning to the right, plunged into the bracing
calcareous region of flintcomb-ash, the address from which she had
written to him in one of the letter

oing so had gone on to another place they mentioned.  by this time
clare abhorred the house for ceasing to contain tess, and hastened
away from its hated presence without once looking back.

his way was by the field in which he had first beheld her at the
dance.  it was as bad as the house--even worse.  he passed on through
the churchyard, where, amongst the new headstones, he saw one of a
somewhat superior design to the rest.  the inscription ran thus:


  in memory of john durbeyfield, rightly d'urberville, of
  the once powerful family of that name, and direct
  descendant through an illustrious line from sir pagan
  d'urberville, one of the knights of the conqueror.  died
  march 10th, 18--

                how are the mighty fallen.


some man, apparently the sexton, had observed clare standing there,
and drew nigh.  "ah, sir, now that's a man who didn't want to lie
here, but wished to be carried to kingsbere, where his ancestors be."

"and why didn't they respect his wish?"

"oh--no money.  b

shook his head.

then, remembering that she would have been likely to continue the use
of her maiden name, clare said--

"of a miss durbeyfield?"

"durbeyfield?"

this also was strange to the postman addressed.

"there's visitors coming and going every day, as you know, sir," he
said; "and without the name of the house 'tis impossible to find
'em."

one of his comrades hastening out at that moment, the name was
repeated to him.

"i know no name of durbeyfield; but there is the name of d'urberville
at the herons," said the second.

"that's it!" cried clare, pleased to think that she had reverted to
the real pronunciation.  "what place is the herons?"

"a stylish lodging-house.  'tis all lodging-houses here, bless 'ee."

clare received directions how to find the house, and hastened
thither, arriving with the milkman.  the herons, though an ordinary
villa, stood in its own grounds, and was certainly the last place
in which one would have expected to find lodgings, so private was

nce.  if poor tess was a servant here, as he feared, she
would go to the back-door to that milkman, and he was inclined to go
thither also.  however, in his doubts he turned to the front, and
rang.

the hour being early, the landlady herself opened the door.  clare
inquired for teresa d'urberville or durbeyfield.

"mrs d'urberville?"

"yes."

tess, then, passed as a married woman, and he felt glad, even though
she had not adopted his name.

"will you kindly tell her that a relative is anxious to see her?"

"it is rather early.  what name shall i give, sir?"

"angel."

"mr angel?"

"no; angel.  it is my christian name.  she'll understand."

"i'll see if she is awake."

he was shown into the front room--the dining-room--and looked out
through the spring curtains at the little lawn, and the rhododendrons
and other shrubs upo

mrs brooks, the lady who was the householder at the herons and owner
of all the handsome furniture, was not a person of an unusually
curious turn of mind. she was too deeply materialized, poor woman,
by her long and enforced bondage to that arithmetical demon
profit-and-loss, to retain much curiousity for its own sake, and
apart from possible lodgers' pockets.  nevertheless, the visit of
angel clare to her well-paying tenants, mr and mrs d'urberville, as
she deemed them, was sufficiently exceptional in point of time and
manner to reinvigorate the feminine proclivity which had been stifled
down as useless save in its bearings to the letting trade.

tess had spoken to her husband from the doorway, without entering
the dining-room, and mrs brooks, who stood within the partly-closed
door of her own sitting-room at the back of the passage, could
hear fragments of the conversation--if conversation it could be
called--between those two wretched so

door of the room
above was shut, and mrs brooks knew that tess had re-entered her
apartment.  as the young lady was not fully dressed, mrs brooks knew
that she would not emerge again for some time.

she accordingly ascended the stairs softly, and stood at the door of
the front room--a drawing-room, connected with the room immediately
behind it (which was a bedroom) by folding-doors in the common
manner.  this first floor, containing mrs brooks's best apartments,
had been taken by the week by the d'urbervilles.  the back room was
now in silence; but from the drawing-room there came sounds.

all that she could at first distinguish of them was one syllable,
continually repeated in a low note of moaning, as if it came from a
soul bound to some ixionian wheel--

"o--o--o!"

then a silence, then a heavy sigh, and again--

"o--o--o!"

the landlady looked through the keyhole.  only a small space of the
room inside was visible, but within that space came a corner of the
breakfast table, which was already sp

of garments against the banisters, the opening and the closing of
the front door, and the form of tess passing to the gate on her way
into the street.  she was fully dressed now in the walking costume
of a well-to-do young lady in which she had arrived, with the sole
addition that over her hat and black feathers a veil was drawn.

mrs brooks had not been able to catch any word of farewell, temporary
or otherwise, between her tenants at the door above.  they might have
quarrelled, or mr d'urberville might still be asleep, for he was not
an early riser.

she went into the back room, which was more especially her own
apartment, and continued her sewing there.  the lady lodger did not
return, nor did the gentleman ring his bell.  mrs brooks pondered on
the delay, and on what probable relation the visitor who had called
so early bore to the couple upstairs.  in reflecting she leant back
in her chair.

as she did so her eyes glanced casually over the ceiling till they
were arrested by a spot in

by degrees he was inclined to believe that she had faintly attempted,
at least, what she said she had done; and his horror at her impulse
was mixed with amazement at the strength of her affection for
himself, and at the strangeness of its quality, which had apparently
extinguished her moral sense altogether.  unable to realize the
gravity of her conduct, she seemed at last content; and he looked
at her as she lay upon his shoulder, weeping with happiness, and
wondered what obscure strain in the d'urberville blood had led to
this aberration--if it were an aberration.  there momentarily flashed
through his mind that the family tradition of the coach and murder
might have arisen because the d'urbervilles had been known to do
these things.  as well as his confused and excited ideas could
reason, he supposed that in the moment of mad grief of which she
spoke, her mind had lost its balance, and plunged her into this
abyss.

it was very terrible if true; if a temporary hallucination, sad.  but,

"a very temple of the winds," he said.

the next pillar was isolated; others composed a trilithon; others
were prostrate, their flanks forming a causeway wide enough for a
carriage; and it was soon obvious that they made up a forest of
monoliths grouped upon the grassy expanse of the plain.  the couple
advanced further into this pavilion of the night till they stood in
its midst.

"it is stonehenge!" said clare.

"the heathen temple, you mean?"

"yes.  older than the centuries; older than the d'urbervilles!  well,
what shall we do, darling?  we may find shelter further on."

but tess, really tired by this time, flung herself upon an oblong
slab that lay close at hand, and was sheltered from the wind by a
pillar.  owing to the action of the sun during the preceding day, the
stone was warm and dry, in comforting contrast to the rough and chill
grass around, which had damped her skirts and shoes.

"i don't want to go any further, angel," she said, stretching out her
hand for his.  "can't we bide he

 and against the light, it
seemed the one blot on the city's beauty.  yet it was with this blot,
and not with the beauty, that the two gazers were concerned.

upon the cornice of the tower a tall staff was fixed.  their eyes
were riveted on it.  a few minutes after the hour had struck
something moved slowly up the staff, and extended itself upon the
breeze.  it was a black flag.

"justice" was done, and the president of the immortals, in aeschylean
phrase, had ended his sport with tess.  and the d'urberville knights
and dames slept on in their tombs unknowing.  the two speechless
gazers bent themselves down to the earth, as if in prayer, and
remained thus a long time, absolutely motionless: the flag continued
to wave silently.  as soon as they had strength, they arose, joined
hands again, and went on.
