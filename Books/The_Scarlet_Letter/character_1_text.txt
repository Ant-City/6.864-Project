imaginations, had a story about the scarlet letter which we
might readily work up into a terrific legend.  they averred that
the symbol was not mere scarlet cloth, tinged in an earthly
dye-pot, but was red-hot with infernal fire, and could be seen
glowing all alight whenever hester prynne walked abroad in the
night-time.  and we must needs say it seared hester's bosom so
deeply, that perhaps there was more truth in the rumour than our
modern incredulity may be inclined to admit.



vi.  pearl

we have as yet hardly spoken of the infant; that little
creature, whose innocent life had sprung, by the inscrutable
decree of providence, a lovely and immortal flower, out of the
rank luxuriance of a guilty passion.  how strange it seemed to
the sad woman, as she watched the growth, and the beauty that
became every day more brilliant, and the intelligence that threw
its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child!  her
pearl--for so had hester called her; not as a name expressive

of
her aspect, which had nothing of the calm, white, unimpassioned
lustre that would be indicated by the comparison.  but she named
the infant "pearl," as being of great price--purchased with all
she had--her mother's only treasure!  how strange, indeed!  man
had marked this woman's sin by a scarlet letter, which had such
potent and disastrous efficacy that no human sympathy could
reach her, save it were sinful like herself.  god, as a direct
consequence of the sin which man thus punished, had given her a
lovely child, whose place was on that same dishonoured bosom, to
connect her parent for ever with the race and descent of
mortals, and to

ical defect.  by its perfect shape,
its vigour, and its natural dexterity in the use of all its
untried limbs, the infant was worthy to have been brought forth
in eden: worthy to have been left there to be the plaything of
the angels after the world's first parents were driven out.  the
child had a native grace which does not invariably co-exist with
faultless beauty; its attire, however simple, always impressed
the beholder as if it were the very garb that precisely became
it best.  but little pearl was not clad in rustic weeds.  her
mother, with a morbid purpose that may be better understood
hereafter, had bought the richest tissues that could be
procured, and allowed her imaginative faculty its full play in
the arrangement and decoration of the dresses which the child
wore before the public eye.  so magnificent was the small figure
when thus arrayed, and such was the splendour of pearl's own
proper beauty, shining through the gorgeous robes which might
have extinguished a paler lovelines

s, that there was an absolute
circle of radiance around her on the darksome cottage floor.  and
yet a russet gown, torn and soiled with the child's rude play,
made a picture of her just as perfect.  pearl's aspect was imbued
with a spell of infinite variety; in this one child there were
many children, comprehending the full scope between the
wild-flower prettiness of a peasant-baby, and the pomp, in
little, of an infant princess.  throughout all, however, there
was a trait of passion, a certain depth of hue, which she never
lost; and if in any of her changes, she had grown fainter or
paler, she would have ceased to be herself--it would have been
no longer pearl!

been broken; and the result was a being whose elements were
perhaps beautiful and brilliant, but all in disorder, or with an
order peculiar to themselves, amidst which the point of variety
and arrangement was difficult or impossible to be discovered.
hester could only account for the child's character--and even
then most vaguely and imperfectly--by recalling what she herself
had been during that momentous period while pearl was imbibing
her soul from the spiritual world, and her bodily frame from its
material of earth.  the mother's impassioned state had been the
medium through which were transmitted to the unborn infant the
rays of its moral life; and, however white and clear originally,
they had taken the deep stains of crimson and gold, the fiery
lustre, the black shadow, and the untempered light of the
intervening substance.  above all, the warfare of hester's spirit
at that epoch was perpetuated in pearl.  sh

control over the infant immortality that was committed to her
charge.  but the task was beyond her skill.  after testing both
smiles and frowns, and proving that neither mode of treatment
possessed any calculable influence, hester was ultimately
compelled to stand aside and permit the child to be swayed by
her own impulses.  physical compulsion or restraint was
effectual, of course, while it lasted.  as to any other kind of
discipline, whether addressed to her mind or heart, little pearl
might or might not be within its reach, in accordance with the
caprice that ruled the moment.  her mother, while pearl was yet
an infant, grew acquainted with a certain peculiar look, that
warned her when it would be labour thrown away to insist,
persuade or plead.

it was a look so intelligent, yet inexplicable, perverse,
sometimes so malicious, but generally accompanied by a wild flow
of spirits, that hester could not help questioning at such
moments whether pearl was a human child.  she seem

deeply black eyes, it invested her with a strange remoteness and
intangibility: it was as if she were hovering in the air, and
might vanish, like a glimmering light that comes we know not
whence and goes we know not whither.  beholding it, hester was
constrained to rush towards the child--to pursue the little elf
in the flight which she invariably began--to snatch her to her
bosom with a close pressure and earnest kisses--not so much from
overflowing love as to assure herself that pearl was flesh and
blood, and not utterly delusive.  but pearl's laugh, when she was
caught, though full of merriment and music, made her mother more
doubtful than before.

heart-smitten at this bewildering and baffling spell, that so
often came between herself and her sole treasure, whom she had
bought so dear, and who was all her world, hester sometimes
burst into passionate tears.  then, perhaps--for there was no
foreseeing how it might affect her--pearl would frown, and
clench her little fist, a

y as it came.  brooding over all these matters,
the mother felt like one who has evoked a spirit, but, by some
irregularity in the process of conjuration, has failed to win
the master-word that should control this new and
incomprehensible intelligence.  her only real comfort was when
the child lay in the placidity of sleep.  then she was sure of
her, and tasted hours of quiet, sad, delicious happiness;
until--perhaps with that perverse expression glimmering from
beneath her opening lids--little pearl awoke!

how soon--with what strange rapidity, indeed did pearl arrive at
an age that was capable of social intercourse beyond the
mother's ever-ready smile and nonsense-words!  and then what a
happiness would it have been could hester prynne have heard her
clear, bird-like voice mingling with the uproar of other
childish voices, and have distinguished and unravelled her own
darling's tones, amid all the entangled outcry of a group of
sportive children.  but this could never be.  pearl was a bor

nothing was more remarkable than the instinct, as it seemed,
with which the child comprehended her loneliness: the destiny
that had drawn an inviolable circle round about her: the whole
peculiarity, in short, of her position in respect to other
children.  never since her release from prison had hester met the
public gaze without her.  in all her walks about the town, pearl,
too, was there: first as the babe in arms, and afterwards as the
little girl, small companion of her mother, holding a forefinger
with her whole grasp, and tripping along at the rate of three or
four footsteps to one of hester's.  she saw the children of the
settlement on the grassy margin of the street, or at the
domestic thresholds, disporting themselves in such grim fashions
as the puritanic nurture would permit; playing at going to
church, perchance, or at scourging quakers; or taking scal

a sham fight with the indians, or scaring one another with
freaks of imitative witchcraft.  pearl saw, and gazed intently,
but never sought to make acquaintance.  if spoken to, she would
not speak again.  if the children gathered about her, as they
sometimes did, pearl would grow positively terrible in her puny
wrath, snatching up stones to fling at them, with shrill,
incoherent exclamations, that made her mother tremble, because
they had so much the sound of a witch's anathemas in some
unknown tongue.

the truth was, that the little puritans, being of the most
intolerant brood that ever lived, had got a vague idea of
something outlandish, unearthly, or at variance with ordinary
fashions, in the mother and child, and therefore scorned them in
their hearts, an

d not unfrequently reviled them with their
tongues.  pearl felt the sentiment, and requited it with the
bitterest hatred that can be supposed to rankle in a childish
bosom.  these outbreaks of a fierce temper had a kind of value,
and even comfort for the mother; because there was at least an
intelligible earnestness in the mood, instead of the fitful
caprice that so often thwarted her in the child's
manifestations.  it appalled her, nevertheless, to discern here,
again, a shadowy reflection of the evil that had existed in
herself.  all this enmity and

passion had pearl inherited, by
inalienable right, out of hester's heart.  mother and daughter
stood together in the same circle of seclusion from human
society; and in the nature of the child seemed to be perpetuated
those unquiet elements that had distracted hester prynne before
pearl's birth, but had since begun to be soothed away by the
softening influences of maternity.

at home, within and around her mother's cottage, pearl wanted
not a wide and various circle of acquaintance.  the spell of life
went forth from her ever-creative spirit, and communicated
itself to a thousand objects, as a torch kindles a flame
wherever it may be applied.  the unlikeliest materials--a stick,
a bunch of rags, a flower--were the puppets of pearl's
witchcraft, and, without undergoing any outward change, became
spiritually adapted to whatever drama occupied the stage of her
inner world.  her one baby-voice served a multitude of imaginar

it was wonderful, the vast variety of forms into which she threw
her intellect, with no continuity, indeed, but darting up and
dancing, always in a state of preternatural activity--soon
sinking down, as if exhausted by so rapid and feverish a tide of
life--and succeeded by other shapes of a similar wild energy.  it
was like nothing so much as the phantasmagoric play of the
northern lights.  in the mere exercise of the fancy, however, and

ss of a growing mind, there might be a little more
than was observable in other children of bright faculties;
except as pearl, in the dearth of human playmates, was thrown
more upon the visionary throng which she created.  the
singularity lay in the hostile feelings with which the child
regarded all these offsprings of her own heart and mind.  she
never created a friend, but seemed always to be sowing broadcast
the dragon's teeth, whence sprung a harvest of armed enemies,
against whom she rushed to battle.  it was inexpressibly
sad--then what depth of sorrow to a mother, who felt in her own
heart the cause--to observe

, in one so young, this constant
recognition of an adverse world, and so fierce a training of the
energies that were to make good her cause in the contest that
must ensue.

gazing at pearl, hester prynne often dropped her work upon her
knees, and cried out with an agony which she would fain have
hidden, but which made utterance for itself betwixt speech and a
groan--"o father in heaven--if thou art still my father--what is
this being which i have brought into the world?" and pearl,
overhearing the ejaculation, or aware through some more subtile
channel, of those throbs of anguish, would turn her vivid and
beautiful little face upon her mother, smile with sprite-like
intelligence, and resume her play.

one peculiarity of the child's deportment remains yet to be
told.  the very first thing which she had noticed in her life,
was--what?--not the mother's smile, responding to it, as other
babies do, by that faint, embryo smile of the little mouth,
remembered so doubtfully aft

erwards, and with such fond
discussion whether it were indeed a smile.  by no means!  but that
first object of which pearl seemed to become aware was--shall we
say it?--the scarlet letter on hester's bosom!  one day, as her
mother stooped over the cradle, the infant's eyes had been
caught by the glimmering of the gold embroidery about the
letter; and putting up her little hand she grasped at it,
smiling, not doubtfully, but with a decided gleam, that gave her
face the look of a much older child.  then, gasping for breath,
did hester prynne clutch the fatal token, instinctively
endeavouring to tear it away, so infin

ite was the torture
inflicted by the intelligent touch of pearl's baby-hand.  again,
as if her mother's agonised gesture were meant only to make
sport for her, did little pearl look into her eyes, and smile.
from that epoch, except when the child was asleep, hester had
never felt a moment's safety: not a moment's calm enjoyment of
her.  weeks, it is true, would sometimes elapse, during which
pearl's gaze might never once be fixed upon the scarlet letter;
but then, again, it would come at unawares, like the stroke of
sudden death, and always with that peculiar smile and odd
expression of the eyes.

once this freakish, elvish cast came into the child's eyes while
hester was looking at her own image in them, as mothers are fond
of doing; and suddenly for women in solitude, and with troubled
hearts, are pestered with unaccountable delusions she fancied
that she beheld, not her own miniature

portrait, but another
face in the small black mirror of pearl's eye.  it was a face,
fiend-like, full of smiling malice, yet bearing the semblance of
features that she had known full well, though seldom with a
smile, and never with malice in them.  it was as if an evil
spirit possessed the child, and had just then peeped forth in
mockery.  many a time afterwards had hester been tortured, though
less vividly, by the same illusion.

in the afternoon of a certain summer's day, after pearl grew big
enough to run about, she amused herself with gathering handfuls
of wild flowers, and flinging them, one by one, at her mother's
bosom; dancing up and down like a little elf whenever she hit
the scarlet letter.  hester's first motion had been to cover her
bosom with her clasped hands.  but whether from pride or
resignation, or a feeling that her penance might best be wrought
out by this unutterable pain, she resisted the impulse, and sat
erect, pale as death, looking sadly into little p

came the battery of flowers, almost invariably
hitting the mark, and covering the mother's breast with hurts
for which she could find no balm in this world, nor knew how to
seek it in another.  at last, her shot being all expended, the
child stood still and gazed at hester, with that little laughing
image of a fiend peeping out--or, whether it peeped or no, her
mother so imagined it--from the unsearchable abyss of her black
eyes.

"child, what art thou?" cried the mother.

"oh, i am your little pearl!" answered the child.

but while she said it, pearl laughed, and began to dance up and
down with the humoursome gesticulation of a little imp, whose
next freak might be to fly up the chimney.

"art thou my child, in very truth?" asked hester.

nor did she put the question altogether idly, but, for the
moment, with a portion of genuine earnestness; for, such was
pearl's wonderful intelligence, that her mother half doubted
whether she were not acquainted with the secret spell of her
existence, an

d might not now reveal herself.

"yes; i am little pearl!" repeated the child, continuing her
antics.

"thou art not my child!  thou art no pearl of mine!" said the
mother half playfully; for it was often the case that a sportive
impulse came over her in the midst of her deepest suffering.
"tell me, then, what thou art, and who sent thee hither?"

"tell me, mother!" said the child, seriously, coming up to
hester, and pressing herself close to her knees.  "do thou tell
me!"

"thy heavenly father sent thee!" answered hester prynne.

but she said it with a hesitation that did not escape the
acuteness of the child.  whether moved only by her

 ordinary
freakishness, or because an evil spirit prompted her, she put up
her small forefinger and touched the scarlet letter.

"he did not send me!" cried she, positively.  "i have no
heavenly father!"

"hush, pearl, hush!  thou must not talk so!" answered the
mother, suppressing a groan.  "he sent us all into the world.  he
sent even me, thy mother.  then, much more thee!  or, if not, thou
strange and elfish child, whence didst thou come?"

"tell me!  tell me!" repeated pearl, no longer seriously, but
laughing and capering about the floor.  "it is thou that must
tell me!"

but hester could not resolve the query, being herself in a
dismal labyrinth of doubt.  she remembered--betwixt a smile and a
shudder--the talk of the neighbouring townspeople, who, seeking
vainly elsewhere for the child's paternity, and observing some
of her odd attributes, had given out that poor little pearl was
a demon offspring: such as, ever since old catholic times, had
occasionally been see

luther, according to the scandal of his monkish enemies, was a
brat of that hellish breed; nor was pearl the only child to whom
this inauspicious origin was assigned among the new england
puritans.



vii.  the governor's hall

hester prynne went one day to the mansion of governor
bellingham, with a pair of gloves which she had fringed and
embroidered to his order, and which were to be worn on some
great occasion of state; for, though the chances of a popular
election had caused this former ruler to descend a step or two
from the highest rank, he still held an honourable and
influential place amon

g the colonial magistracy.

another and far more important reason than the delivery of a
pair of embroidered gloves, impelled hester, at this time, to
seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity
in the affairs of the settlement.  it had reached her ears that
there was a design on the part of some of the leading
inhabitants, cherishing the more rigid order of principles in
religion and government, to deprive her of her child.  on the
supposition that pearl, as already hinted, was of demon origin,
these good people not unreasonably argued that a christian
interest in the mother's soul required them to remove such a
stumbling-block from her path.  if the child, on the other hand,
were really capable of moral and religious growth, and possessed
the elements of ultimate salvation, then, surely, it would enjoy
all the fairer prospect of these advantages by being transferred
to wiser and better guardianship than hester prynne's.  among

ory, when a dispute concerning the right of
property in a pig not only caused a fierce and bitter contest in
the legislative body of the colony, but resulted in an important
modification of the framework itself of the legislature.

full of concern, therefore--but so conscious of her own right
that it seemed scarcely an unequal match between the public on
the one side, and a lonely woman, backed by the sympathies of
nature, on the other--hester prynne set forth from her solitary
cottage.  little pearl, of course, was her companion.  she was now
of an age to run lightly along by her mother's side, and,
constantly in motion from morn till sunset, could have
accomplished a much longer journey than that before her.  often,
nevertheless, more from caprice than necessity, she demanded to
be taken up in arms; but was soon as imperious to be let down
again, and frisked onward before hester on the grassy pathway,
with many a harmless trip and tumble.  we have spoken of pearl's
rich and luxuriant beau
 
 ___________________________
 
rly akin to black.  there was
fire in her and throughout her: she seemed the unpremeditated
offshoot of a passionate moment.  her mother, in contriving the
child's garb, had allowed the gorgeous tendencies of her
imagination their full play, arraying her in a crimson velvet
tunic of a peculiar cut, abundantly embroidered in fantasies and
flourishes of gold thread.  so much strength of colouring, which
must have given a wan and pallid aspect to cheeks of a fainter
bloom, was admirably adapted to pearl's beauty, and made her the
very brightest little jet of flame that ever danced upon the
earth.

but it was a remarkable attribute of this garb, and indeed, of
the child's whole appearance, that it irresistibly and
inevitably reminded the beholder of the token which hester
prynne was doomed to wear upon her bosom.  it was the scarlet
letter in another form: the scarlet letter endowed with life!
the mother herself--as if the red ignominy were so deeply
scorched into her brain that all her concept
 
 ___________________________
 
ions assumed its
form--had carefully wrought out the similitude, lavishing many
hours of morbid ingenuity to create an analogy between the
object of her affection and the emblem of her guilt and torture.
but, in truth, pearl was the one as well as the other; and only
in consequence of that identity had hester contrived so
perfectly to represent the scarlet letter in her appearance.

as the two wayfarers came within the precincts of the town, the
children of the puritans looked up from their play,--or what
passed for play with those sombre little urchins--and spoke
gravely one to another.

"behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlet letter: and
of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlet
letter

 running along by her side!  come, therefore, and let us
fling mud at them!"

but pearl, who was a dauntless child, after frowning, stamping
her foot, and shaking her little hand with a variety of
threatening gestures, suddenly made a rush at the knot of her
enemies, and put them all to flight.  she resembled, in her
fierce pursuit of them, an infant pestilence--the scarlet fever,
or some such half-fledged angel of judgment--whose mission was
to punish the sins of the rising generation.  she screamed and
shouted, too, with a terrific volume of sound, which, doubtless,
caused the h

earts of the fugitives to quake within them.  the
victory accomplished, pearl returned quietly to her mother, and
looked up, smiling, into her face.

without further adventure, they reached the dwelling of governor
bellingham.  this was a large wooden house, built in a fashion of
which there are specimens still extant in the streets of our
older towns now moss-grown, crumbling to decay, and melancholy
at heart with the many sorrowful or joyful occurrences,
remembered or forgotten, that have happened and passed away
within their dusky chambers.  then, however, there was t

fell aslant-wise over the
front of the edifice, it glittered and sparkled as if diamonds
had been flung against it by the double handful.  the brilliancy
might have be fitted aladdin's palace rather than the mansion of
a grave old puritan ruler.  it was further decorated with strange
and seemingly cabalistic figures and diagrams, suitable to the
quaint taste of the age which had been drawn in the stucco, when
newly laid on, and had now grown hard and durable, for the
admiration of after times.

pearl, looking at this bright wonder of a house began to caper
and dance, and imperatively required that the whole breadth of
sunshine should be stripped off its front, and given her to play
with.

"no, my little pearl!" said her mother; "thou must gather thine
own sunshine.  i have none to give thee!"

they approached the door, which was of an arched form, and
flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projection of the
edifice, in both of which were lattice-windows, the wooden
shutters to close over

wide-open eyes at the scarlet letter, which, being a new-comer
in the country, he had never before seen.  "yea, his honourable
worship is within.  but he hath a godly minister or two with him,
and likewise a leech.  ye may not see his worship now."

"nevertheless, i will enter," answered hester prynne; and the
bond-servant, perhaps judging from the decision of her air, and
the glittering symbol in her bosom, that she was a great lady in
the land, offered no opposition.

so the mother and little pearl were admitted into the hall of
entrance.  with many variations, suggested by the nature of his
building materials, diversity of climate, and a different mode
of social life, governor bellingham had planned his new
habitation after the residences of gentlemen of fair estate in
his native land.  here, then, was a wide and reasonably lofty
hall, extending through the whole depth of the house, and
forming a medium of general communication, more or less
directly, with all the other apartments.  at o

ned over by the casual guest.  the
furniture of the hall consisted of some ponderous chairs, the
backs of which were elaborately carved with wreaths of oaken
flowers; and likewise a table in the same taste, the whole being
of the elizabethan age, or perhaps earlier, and heirlooms,
transferred hither from the governor's paternal home.  on the
table--in token that the sentiment of old english hospitality
had not been left behind--stood a large pewter tankard, at the
bottom of which, had hester or pearl peeped into it, they might
have seen the frothy remnant of a recent draught of ale.

on the wall hung a row of portraits, representing the
forefathers of the bellingham lineage, some with armour on their
breasts, and others with stately ruffs and robes of peace.  all
were characterised by the sternness and severity which old
portraits so invariably put on, as if they were the ghosts,
rather than the pictures, of departed worthies, and were gazing
with harsh and intolerant criticism at the pursu

 illumination everywhere about

show, but had been worn by the governor on many a solemn muster
and training field, and had glittered, moreover, at the head of
a regiment in the pequod war.  for, though bred a lawyer, and
accustomed to speak of bacon, coke, noye, and finch, as his
professional associates, the exigencies of this new country had
transformed governor bellingham into a soldier, as well as a
statesman and ruler.

little pearl, who was as greatly pleased with the gleaming
armour as she had been with the glittering frontispiece of the
house, spent some time looking into the polished mirror of the
breastplate.

"mother," cried she, "i see you here.  look!  look!"

hester looked by way of humouring the child; and she saw that,
owing to the peculiar effect of this convex mirror, the scarlet
letter was represented in exaggerated and gigantic proportions,
so as to be greatly the most prominent feature of her
appearance.  i

n truth, she seemed absolutely hidden behind it.
pearl pointed upwards also, at a similar picture in the
head-piece; smiling at her mother, with the elfish intelligence
that was so familiar an expression on her small physiognomy.
that look of naughty merriment was likewise reflected in the
mirror, with so much breadth and intensity of effect, that it
made hester prynne feel as if it could not be the image of her
own child, but of an imp who was seeking to mould itself into
pearl's shape.

"come along, pearl," said she, drawing her away, "come and look
into this fair garden.  it may be we shall see flowers there;
more beautiful ones than we find in the woods."

pearl accordingly ran to the bow-window, at the further end of
the hall, and looked along the vista of a garden walk, carpeted
with closely-shaven grass, and bordered with some rude and
immature attempt at shrubbery.  but the proprietor appeared
already to have relinquished as hopeless, the effort to

ervening space, and deposited one of its gigantic products
directly beneath the hall window, as if to warn the governor
that this great lump of vegetable gold was as rich an ornament
as new england earth would offer him.  there were a few
rose-bushes, however, and a number of apple-trees, probably the
descendants of those planted by the reverend mr. blackstone, the
first settler of the peninsula; that half mythological personage
who rides through our early annals, seated on the back of a
bull.

pearl, seeing the rose-bushes, began to cry for a red rose, and
would not be pacified.

"hush, child--hush!" said her mother, earnestly.  "do not cry,
dear little pearl!  i hear voices in the garden.  the governor is
coming, and gentlemen along with him."

in fact, adown the vista of the garden avenue, a number of
persons were seen approaching towards the house.  pearl, in utter
scorn of her mother's attempt to quiet her, gave an eldritch
scream, and then became silent, not from any notion of

understood that this learned man was the physician as well as
friend of the young minister, whose health had severely suffered
of late by his too unreserved self-sacrifice to the labours and
duties of the pastoral relation.

the governor, in advance of his visitors, ascended one or two
steps, and, throwing open the leaves of the great hall window,
found himself close to little pearl.  the shadow of the curtain
fell on hester prynne, and partially concealed her.

"what have we here?" said governor bellingham, looking with
surprise at the scarlet little figure before him.  "i profess, i

james's time, when i was wont to esteem it a high favour to be

catechism?  or art thou one of those naughty elfs or fairies whom
we thought to have left behind us, with other relics of
papistry, in merry old england?"

"i am mother's child," answered the scarlet vision, "and my name
is pearl!"

"pearl?--ruby, rather--or coral!--or red rose, at the very
least, judging from thy hue!" responded the old minister,
putting forth his hand in a vain attempt to pat little pearl on
the cheek.  "but where is this mother of thine?  ah!  i see," he
added; and, turning to governor bellingham, whispered, "this is
the selfsame child of whom we have held speech together; and
behold here the unhappy woman, hester prynne, her mother!"

"sayest thou so?" cried the governor.  "nay, we might have

thy little one's temporal and eternal welfare that she be taken
out of thy charge, and clad soberly, and disciplined strictly,
and instructed in the truths of heaven and earth?  what canst
thou do for the child in this kind?"

"i can teach my little pearl what i have learned from this!"
answered hester prynne, laying her finger on the red token.

"woman, it is thy badge of shame!" replied the stern magistrate.
"it is because of the stain which that letter indicates that we
would transfer thy child to other hands."

"nevertheless," said the mother, calmly, though growing more
pale, "this badge hath taught me--it daily teaches me--it is
teaching me at this moment--lessons whereof my child may be the
wiser and better, albeit they can profit nothing

 to myself."

"we will judge warily," said bellingham, "and look well what we
are about to do.  good master wilson, i pray you, examine this
pearl--since that is her name--and see whether she hath had such
christian nurture as befits a child of her age."

the old minister seated himself in an arm-chair and made an
effort to draw pearl betwixt his knees.  but the child,
unaccustomed to the touch or familiarity of any but her mother,
escaped through the open window, and stood on the upper step,
looking like a wild tropical bird of rich plumage, ready to take
flight into the upper air.  mr. wilson, not a little astonished
at this outbreak--for he was a grandfatherly sort of personage,
and usually a vast favourite with children--essayed, however, to
proceed with the examination.

"pearl," said he, with great solemnity, "thou mus

t take heed to
instruction, that so, in due season, thou mayest wear in thy
bosom the pearl of great price.  canst thou tell me, my child,
who made thee?"

now pearl knew well enough who made her, for hester prynne, the
daughter of a pious home, very soon after her talk with the
child about her heavenly father, had begun to inform her of
those truths which the human spirit, at whatever stage of
immaturity, imbibes with such eager interest.  pearl,
therefore--so large were the attainments of her three years'
lifetime--could have borne a fair examination in the new england
primer, or the first column of the westminster catechisms,
although unacquainted with the outward form of either of those
celebrated works.  but that perversity, which all children have
more or less of, and of which little pearl had a tenfold
portion, now, at the most inopportune moment, took thorough
possession of her, and closed her lips, or impelled her to speak
word

s amiss.  after putting her finger in her mouth, with many
ungracious refusals to answer good mr. wilson's question, the
child finally announced that she had not been made at all, but
had been plucked by her mother off the bush of wild roses that
grew by the prison-door.

this phantasy was probably suggested by the near proximity of
the governor's red roses, as pearl stood outside of the window,
together with her recollection of the prison rose-bush, which
she had passed in coming hither.

old roger chillingworth, with a smile on his face, whispered
something in the young clergyman's ear.  hester prynne looked at
the man of skill, and even then, with her fate hanging in the
balance, was startled to perceive what a change had come over
his features--how much uglier they were, how his dark complexion
seemed to have grown duskier, and his figure more
misshapen

--since the days when she had familiarly known him.  she
met his eyes for an instant, but was immediately constrained to
give all her attention to the scene now going forward.

"this is awful!" cried the governor, slowly recovering from the
astonishment into which pearl's response had thrown him.  "here
is a child of three years old, and she cannot tell who made her!
without question, she is equally in the dark as to her soul, its
present depravity, and future destiny!  methinks, gentlemen, we
need inquire no further."

hester caught hold of pearl, and drew her forcibly into her
arms, confronting the old puritan magistrate with almost a
fierce expression.  alone in the world, cast off by it, and with
this sole treasure to keep her heart alive, she felt that sh

possessed indefeasible rights against the world, and was ready
to defend them to the death.

"god gave me the child!" cried she.  "he gave her in requital of
all things else which ye had taken from me.  she is my
happiness--she is my torture, none the less!  pearl keeps me here
in life!  pearl punishes me, too!  see ye not, she is the scarlet
letter, only capable of being loved, and so endowed with a
millionfold the power of retribution for my sin?  ye shall not
take her!  i will die first!"

"my poor woman," said the not unkind old minister, "the child
shall be well cared for--far better than thou canst do for it."

"god gave her into my keeping!" repeated hester prynne, raising
her voice almost to a shriek.  "i will not give her up!"  and here
by a sudden impulse, she turned to the

, to put the child to
due and stated examination in the catechism, at thy hands or
master dimmesdale's.  moreover, at a proper season, the
tithing-men must take heed that she go both to school and to
meeting."

the young minister, on ceasing to speak had withdrawn a few
steps from the group, and stood with his face partially
concealed in the heavy folds of the window-curtain; while the
shadow of his figure, which the sunlight cast upon the floor,
was tremulous with the vehemence of his appeal.  pearl, that wild
and flighty little elf stole softly towards him, and taking his
hand in the grasp of both her own, laid her cheek against it; a
caress so tender, and withal so unobtrusive, that her mother,
who was looking on, asked herself--"is that my pearl?" yet she
knew that there was love in the child's heart, although it
mostly revealed itself in passion, and hardly twice in her
lifetime had been softened by such gentleness as now.  the
minister--for, save the long-sought regards of woman, noth

ing is
sweeter than these marks of childish preference, accorded
spontaneously by a spiritual instinct, and therefore seeming to
imply in us something truly worthy to be loved--the minister
looked round, laid his hand on the child's head, hesitated an
instant, and then kissed her brow.  little pearl's unwonted mood
of sentiment lasted no longer; she laughed, and went capering
down the hall so airily, that old mr. wilson raised a question
whether even her tiptoes touched the floor.

"the little baggage hath witchcraft in her, i profess," said he
to mr. dimmesdale.  "she needs no old woman's broomstick to fly
withal!"

"a strange child!" remarked old roger chillingworth.  "it is
easy to see the mother's part in her.  would it be beyond a
philosopher's research, think ye, gentlemen, to analys

re, and, from it make a mould, to give a shrewd
guess at the father?"

"nay; it would be sinful, in such a question, to follow the clue
of profane philosophy," said mr. wilson.  "better to fast and
pray upon it; and still better, it may be, to leave the mystery
as we find it, unless providence reveal it of its own accord.
thereby, every good christian man hath a title to show a
father's kindness towards the poor, deserted babe."

the affair being so satisfactorily concluded, hester prynne,
with pearl, departed from the house.  as they descended the
steps, it is averred that the lattice of a chamber-window was
thrown open, and forth into the sunny day was thrust the face of
mistress hibbins, governor bellingham's bitter-tempered sister,
and the same who, a few years later, was executed as a witch.

"hist, hist!" said she, while her ill-omened physiognomy seemed
to cast a shadow over the cheerful newness of the house.  "wilt
thou go with us to-night?  there will be a merry company in the

st; and i well-nigh promised the black man that comely
hester prynne should make one."

"make my excuse to him, so please you!" answered hester, with a
triumphant smile.  "i must tarry at home, and keep watch over my
little pearl.  had they taken her from me, i would willingly have
gone with thee into the forest, and signed my name in the black
man's book too, and that with mine own blood!"

"we shall have thee there anon!" said the witch-lady, frowning,
as she drew back her head.

but here--if we suppose this interview betwixt mistress hibbins
and hester prynne to be authentic, and not a parable--was
already an illustration of the young minister's argument against
sundering the relation of a fallen mother to the offspr

f escaping from
any topic that agitated his too sensitive and nervous
temperament.--"but, now, i would ask of my well-skilled
physician, whether, in good sooth, he deems me to have profited
by his kindly care of this weak frame of mine?"

before roger chillingworth could answer, they heard the clear,
wild laughter of a young child's voice, proceeding from the
adjacent burial-ground.  looking instinctively from the open
window--for it was summer-time--the minister beheld hester
prynne and little pearl passing along the footpath that
traversed the enclosure.  pearl looked as beautiful as the day,
but was in one of those moods of perverse merriment which,
whenever they occurred, seemed to remove her entirely out of the
sphere of sympathy or human contact.  she now skipped
irreverently from one grave to another; until coming to the
broad, flat, armorial tombstone of a departed worthy--perhaps of
isaac johnson himself--she began to dance upon it.  in reply to
her mother's command and entreaty th

at she would behave more
decorously, little pearl paused to gather the prickly burrs from
a tall burdock which grew beside the tomb.  taking a handful of
these, she arranged them along the lines of the scarlet letter
that decorated the maternal bosom, to which the burrs, as their
nature was, tenaciously adhered.  hester did not pluck them off.

roger chillingworth had by this time approached the window and
smiled grimly down.

"there is no law, nor reverence for authority, no regard for
human ordinances or opinions, right or wrong, mixed up wi
 
 ___________________________
 
e principle of being?"

"none, save the freedom of a broken law," answered mr.
dimmesdale, in a quiet way, as if he had been discussing the
point within himself, "whether capable of good, i know not."

the child probably overheard their voices, for, looking up to
the window with a bright, but naughty smile of mirth and
intelligence, she threw one of the prickly burrs at the rev.  mr.
dimmesdale.  the sensitive clergyman shrank, with nervous dread,
from the light missile.  detecting his emotion, pearl clapped her
little hands in the most extravagant ecstacy.  hester prynne,
likewise, had involuntarily looked up, and all these four
persons, old and young, regarded one another in silence, till
the child laughed aloud, and shouted--"come away, mother!  come
away, or yonder old black man will catch you!  he hath got hold
of the minister already.  come away, mother or he will catch you!
but he cannot catch little pearl!"

so she drew her mother away, skipping, dancing, and frisking

ghost of a mother--thinnest fantasy of a mother--methinks she
might yet have thrown a pitying glance towards her son!  and now,
through the chamber which these spectral thoughts had made so
ghastly, glided hester prynne leading along little pearl, in her
scarlet garb, and pointing her forefinger, first at the scarlet
letter on her bosom, and then at the clergyman's own breast.

none of these visions ever quite deluded him.  at any moment, by
an effort of his will, he could discern substances through their
misty lack of substance, and convince himself that they were not
solid in their nature, like yonder table of carved oak, or that
big, square, leather-bound and brazen-clasped volume of
divinity.  but, for all that, they were, in one se

carried away by the grotesque horror of this picture, the
minister, unawares, and to his own infinite alarm, burst into a
great peal of laughter.  it was immediately responded to by a
light, airy, childish laugh, in which, with a thrill of the
heart--but he knew not whether of exquisite pain, or pleasure as
acute--he recognised the tones of little pearl.

"pearl!  little pearl!" cried he, after a moment's pause; then,
suppressing his voice--"hester!  hester prynne!  are you there?"

"yes; it is hester prynne!" she replied, in a tone of surprise;
and the minister heard her footsteps approaching from the
side-walk, along which she had been passing.  "it is i, and my
little pearl."

"whence come you, hester?" asked the minister.  "what sent you
hither?"

"i have been watching at a death-bed," answered hester prynne
"at governor winthrop's death-b

ed, and have taken his measure
for a robe, and am now going homeward to my dwelling."

"come up hither, hester, thou and little pearl," said the
reverend mr. dimmesdale.  "ye have both been here before, but i
was not with you.  come up hither once again, and we will stand
all three together."

she silently ascended the steps, and stood on the platform,
holding little pearl by the hand.  the minister felt for the
child's other hand, and took it.  the moment that he did so,
there came what seemed a tumultuous rush of new life, other life
than his own pouring like a torrent into his heart, and hurrying
through all his veins, as if the mother and the child were
communicating their vital warmth to his half-torpid system.  the
three formed an electric chain.

"minister!" whispered little pearl.

"what wouldst thou say, child?" asked mr. dimmesdale.

"wilt thou stand he

re with mother and me, to-morrow noontide?"
inquired pearl.

"nay; not so, my little pearl," answered the minister; for, with
the new energy of the moment, all the dread of public exposure,
that had so long been the anguish of his life, had returned upon
him; and he was already trembling at the conjunction in
which--with a strange joy, nevertheless--he now found
himself--"not so, my child.  i shall, indeed, stand with thy
mother and thee one other day, but not to-morrow."

pearl laughed, and attempted to pull away her hand.  but the
minister held it fast.

"a moment longer, my child!" said he.

"but wilt thou promise," asked pearl, "to take my hand, and
mother's hand, to-morrow noontide?"

"not then, pearl," said the minister; "but another time."

"and what other time?" persisted the child.

"at the great judgment day," whispered the minister; and,
strangely enough, the sense that he was a professional teacher
of the truth impelled him to answer the child so.  "then, a

nd
there, before the judgment-seat, thy mother, and thou, and i
must stand together.  but the daylight of this world shall not
see our meeting!"

pearl laughed again.

but before mr. dimmesdale had done speaking, a light gleamed far
and wide over all the muffled sky.  it was doubtless caused by
one of those meteors, which the night-watcher may so often
observe burning out to waste, in the vacant regions of the
atmosphere.  so powerful was its radiance, that it thoroughly
illuminated the dense medium of cloud betwixt the sky and earth.
the great vault brightened, like the dome of an immense lamp.  it
showed the familiar scene of the street with

ds with the early grass springing up about them; the
garden-plots, black with freshly-turned earth; the wheel-track,
little worn, and even in the market-place margined with green on
either side--all were visible, but with a singularity of aspect
that seemed to give another moral interpretation to the things
of this world than they had ever borne before.  and there stood
the minister, with his hand over his heart; and hester prynne,
with the embroidered letter glimmering on her bosom; and little
pearl, herself a symbol, and the connecting link between those
two.  they stood in the noon of that strange and solemn
splendour, as if it were the light that is to reveal all
secrets, and the daybreak that shall unite all who belong to one
another.

there was witchcraft in little pearl's eyes; and her face, as
she glanced upward at the minister, wore that naughty smile
which made its expression frequently so elvish.  she withdrew her
hand from mr. dimmesdale's, and pointed across the street.  but
he

ed out in lines of dull red light.  not but the meteor may
have shown itself at that point, burning duskily through a veil
of cloud, but with no such shape as his guilty imagination gave
it, or, at least, with so little definiteness, that another's
guilt might have seen another symbol in it.

there was a singular circumstance that characterised mr.
dimmesdale's psychological state at this moment.  all the time
that he gazed upward to the zenith, he was, nevertheless,
perfectly aware that little pearl was pointing her finger towards
old roger chillingworth, who stood at no great distance from the
scaffold.  the minister appeared to see him, with the same glance
that discerned the miraculous letter.  to his feature as to all
other objects, the meteoric light imparted a new expression; or
it might well be that the physician was not careful then, as at
all other times, to hide the malevolence with which he looked
upon his victim.  certainly, if the meteor kindled up the sky,
and disclosed the e

nted on the
darkness after the meteor had vanished, with an effect as if the
street and all things else were at once annihilated.

"who is that man, hester?" gasped mr. dimmesdale, overcome with
terror.  "i shiver at him!  dost thou know the man?  i hate him,
hester!"

she remembered her oath, and was silent.

"i tell thee, my soul shivers at him!" muttered the minister
again.  "who is he?  who is he?  canst thou do nothing for me?  i
have a nameless horror of the man!"

"minister," said little pearl, "i can tell thee who he is!"

"quickly, then, child!" said the minister, bending his ear close
to her lips.  "quickly, and as low as thou canst whisper."

pearl mumbled something into his ear that sounded, indeed, like
human language, but was only such gibberish as children may be
heard amusing themselves with by the hour together.  at all
events, if it involved any secret information in regard to old
roger chillingworth, it was in a tongue unknown to the erudite
clergyman, and did but increas

man, which she owned to no
other, nor to the whole world besides.  the links that united her
to the rest of humankind--links of flowers, or silk, or gold, or
whatever the material--had all been broken.  here was the iron
link of mutual crime, which neither he nor she could break.  like
all other ties, it brought along with it its obligations.

years had come and gone.  pearl was now seven years old.  her
mother, with the scarlet letter on her breast, glittering in its
fantastic embroidery, had long been a familiar object to the
townspeople.  as is apt to be the case when a person stands out
in any prominence before the community, and, at the same time,
interferes neither with public nor individual interests and
convenience, a species of general regard had ultimately grown up
in reference to hester prynne.  it is to the credit of human
nature that, except where its

with nothing now to lose, in the sight of mankind, and with no
hope, and seemingly no wish, of gaining anything, it could only
be a genuine regard for virtue that had brought back the poor
wanderer to its paths.

it was perceived, too, that while hester never put forward even
the humblest title to share in the world's privileges--further
than to breathe the common air and earn daily bread for little
pearl and herself by the faithful labour of her hands--she was
quick to acknowledge her sisterhood with the race of man
whenever benefits were to be conferred.  none so ready as she to
give of her little substance to every demand of poverty, even
though the bitter-hearted pauper threw back a gibe in requital
of the food brought regularly to his door, or the garments
wrought for him by the fingers that could have embroidered a
monarch's robe.  none so self-devoted as hester when pestilence

ceased to be so, might at any moment become a woman again, if
there were only the magic touch to effect the transformation.  we
shall see whether hester prynne were ever afterwards so touched
and so transfigured.

much of the marble coldness of hester's impression was to be
attributed to the circumstance that her life had turned, in a
great measure, from passion and feeling to thought.  standing
alone in the world--alone, as to any dependence on society, and
with little pearl to be guided and protected--alone, and
hopeless of retrieving her position, even had she not scorned to
consider it desirable--she cast away the fragment of a broken
chain.  the world's law was no law for her mind.  it was an age in
which the human intellect, newly emancipated, had taken a more
active and a wider range than for many centuries before.  men of
the sword had overthrown nobles and kings.  men bolder than these
had overthrown and rearranged--not actually, but within the

it is remarkable that persons who speculate the most boldly
often conform with the most perfect quietude to the external
regulations of society.  the thought suffices them, without
investing itself in the flesh and blood of action.  so it seemed
to be with hester.  yet, had little pearl never come to her from
the spiritual world, it might have been far otherwise.  then she
might have come down to us in history, hand in hand with ann
hutchinson, as the foundress of a religious sect.  she might, in
one of her phases, have been a prophetess.  she might, and not
improbably would, have suffered death from the stern tribunals
of the period, for attempting to undermine the foundations of
the puritan establishment.  but, in the education of her child,
the mother's enthusiasm of though

of thought.  they are not to be solved, or only in one
way.  if her heart chance to come uppermost, they vanish.  thus
hester prynne, whose heart had lost its regular and healthy
throb, wandered without a clue in the dark labyrinth of mind;
now turned aside by an insurmountable precipice; now starting
back from a deep chasm.  there was wild and ghastly scenery all
around her, and a home and comfort nowhere.  at times a fearful
doubt strove to possess her soul, whether it were not better to
send pearl at once to heaven, and go herself to such futurity as
eternal justice should provide.

the scarlet letter had not done its office.  now, however, her
interview with the reverend mr. dimmesdale, on the night of his
vigil, had given her a new theme of reflection, and held up to
her an object that appeared worthy of any exertion and sacrifice
for its attainment.  she had witnessed the intense misery beneath
which the minister struggled, or, to speak more accurately, had
ceased to struggle.  she sa

y that was still new, when they had talked
together in the prison-chamber.  she had climbed her way since
then to a higher point.  the old man, on the other hand, had
brought himself nearer to her level, or, perhaps, below it, by
the revenge which he had stooped for.

in fine, hester prynne resolved to meet her former husband, and
do what might be in her power for the rescue of the victim on
whom he had so evidently set his gripe.  the occasion was not
long to seek.  one afternoon, walking with pearl in a retired
part of the peninsula, she beheld the old physician with a
basket on one arm and a staff in the other hand, stooping along
the ground in quest of roots and herbs to concoct his medicine
withal.



xiv.  hester and the physician

hester bade little pearl run down to the margin of the water,
and play with the shells and tangled sea-weed, until she should
have talked awhile with yonder gatherer of herbs.  so the child
flew away like a bird, and, making bare her small white feet
went p

she came to a full stop, and peeped curiously into a pool, left

forth peeped at her, out of the pool, with dark, glistening
curls around her head, and an elf-smile in her eyes, the image
of a little maid whom pearl, having no other playmate, invited
to take her hand and run a race with her.  but the visionary
little maid on her part, beckoned likewise, as if to say--"this
is a better place; come thou into the pool."  and pearl, stepping
in mid-leg deep, beheld her own white feet at the bottom; while,
out of a still lower depth, came the gleam of a kind of
fragmentary smile, floating to and fro in the agitated water.

meanwhile her mother had accosted the physician.  "i would speak
a word with you," said s

good for me, no good for thee.  there is no good for little
pearl.  there is no path to guide us out of this dismal maze."

"woman, i could well-nigh pity thee," said roger chillingworth,
unable to restrain a thrill of admiration too, for there was a
quality almost majestic in the despair which she expressed.
"thou hadst great elements.  peradventure, hadst thou met earlier
with a better love than mine, this evil had not been.  i pity
thee, for the good that has been wasted in thy nature."

"and i thee," answered hester prynne, "for the hatred that has

that moment it has all been a dark necessity.  ye that have

may!  now, go thy ways, and deal as thou wilt with yonder man."

he waved his hand, and betook himself again to his employment of
gathering herbs.




xv.  hester and pearl

so roger chillingworth--a deformed old figure with a face that
haunted men's memories longer than they liked--took leave of
hester prynne, and went stooping away along the earth.  he
gathered here and there a herb, or grubbed up a root and put it
into the basket on his arm.  his gray beard almost touched the
ground as he crept onward.  hester gazed after him a little
while, looking with a half fantastic curiosity to see whether
the tender grass of early spring would not be blighted beneath

he warm reality.  but hester ought long ago to have done with
this injustice.  what did it betoken?  had seven long years, under
the torture of the scarlet letter, inflicted so much of misery
and wrought out no repentance?

the emotion of that brief space, while she stood gazing after
the crooked figure of old roger chillingworth, threw a dark
light on hester's state of mind, revealing much that she might
not otherwise have acknowledged to herself.

he being gone, she summoned back her child.

"pearl!  little pearl!  where are you?"

pearl, whose activity of spirit never flagged, had been at no
loss for amusement while her mother talked with the old gatherer
of herbs.  at first, as already told, she had flirted fancifully
with her own image in a pool of water, beckoning the phantom
forth, and--as it declined to venture--seeking a passage for
herself into its sphere of impalpable earth and unattainable
sky.  soon finding, however, that either she or the image was
unreal, she turned elsewhere

melt in
the warm sun.  then she took up the white foam that streaked the
line of the advancing tide, and threw it upon the breeze,
scampering after it with winged footsteps to catch the great
snowflakes ere they fell.  perceiving a flock of beach-birds that
fed and fluttered along the shore, the naughty child picked up
her apron full of pebbles, and, creeping from rock to rock after
these small sea-fowl, displayed remarkable dexterity in pelting
them.  one little gray bird, with a white breast, pearl was
almost sure had been hit by a pebble, and fluttered away with a
broken wing.  but then the elf-child sighed, and gave up her
sport, because it grieved her to have done harm to a little
being that was as wild as the sea-breeze, or as wild as pearl
herself.

her final employment was to gather seaweed of various kinds, and
make herself a scarf or mantle, and a head-dress, and thus
assume the aspect of a little mermaid.  she inherited her
mother's gift for devising drapery and costume.  as the

touch to her mermaid's garb, pearl took some eel-grass and
imitated, as best she could, on her own bosom the decoration
with which she was so familiar on her mother's.  a letter--the
letter a--but freshly green instead of scarlet.  the child bent
her chin upon her breast, and contemplated this device with
strange interest, even as if the one only thing for which she
had been sent into the world was to make out its hidden import.

"i wonder if mother will ask me what it means?" thought pearl.

just then she heard her mother's voice, and, flitting along as
lightly as one of the little sea-birds, appeared before hester
prynne dancing, laughing, and pointing her finger to the
ornament upon her bosom.

"my little pearl," said hester, after a moment's silence, "the
green letter, and on thy childish bosom, has no purport.  but
dost thou know, my child, what this letter means which thy
mother is doomed to wear?"

"yes, mother," said the child.  "it is the great letter a.  thou
hast taught

 me in the horn-book."

hester looked steadily into her little face; but though there
was that singular expression which she had so often remarked in
her black eyes, she could not satisfy herself whether pearl
really attached any meaning to the symbol.  she felt a morbid
desire to ascertain the point.

"dost thou know, child, wherefore thy mother wears this letter?"

"truly do i!" answered pearl, looking brightly into her mother's
face.  "it is for the same reason that the minister keeps his
hand over his heart!"

"and what reason is that?" asked hester, half smiling at the
absurd incongruity of the child's observation; but on second
thoughts turning pale.

"what has the letter to do with any heart save mine?"

"nay, mother, i have told all i know," said pearl, more
seriously than she was wont to speak.  "ask yonder old man whom
thou hast been talking with,--it may be he can tell.  but

mean?--and why dost thou wear it on thy bosom?--and why does the
minister keep his hand over his heart?"

she took her mother's hand in both her own, and gazed into her
eyes with an earnestness that was seldom seen in her wild and
capricious character.  the thought occurred to hester, that the
child might really be seeking to approach her with childlike
confidence, and doing what she could, and as intelligently as
she knew how, to establish a meeting-point of sympathy.  it
showed pearl in an unwonted aspect.  heretofore, the mother,
while loving her child with the intensity of a sole affection,
had schooled herself to hope for little other return than the
waywardness of an april breeze, which spends its time in airy
sport, and has its gusts of inexplicable passion, and is
petulant in its best of moods, and chills oftener than caresses
you, when you take it to your bosom; in requital of which
misdemeanours it will sometimes, of its own vague purpose, kiss
your cheek with a kin

d of doubtful tenderness, and play gently
with your hair, and then be gone about its other idle business,
leaving a dreamy pleasure at your heart.  and this, moreover, was
a mother's estimate of the child's disposition.  any other
observer might have seen few but unamiable traits, and have
given them a far darker colouring.  but now the idea came
strongly into hester's mind, that pearl, with her remarkable
precocity and acuteness, might already have approached the age
when she could have been made a friend, and intrusted with as
much of her mother's sorrows as could be imparted, without
irreverence either to the parent or the child.  in the little
chaos of pearl's character there might be seen emerging and
could have been from the very first--the steadfast principles of
an unflinching courage--an uncontrollable will--sturdy pride,
which might be disciplined into self-respect-

-and a bitter scorn
of many things which, when examined, might be found to have the
taint of falsehood in them.  she possessed affections, too,
though hitherto acrid and disagreeable, as are the richest
flavours of unripe fruit.  with all these sterling attributes,
thought hester, the evil which she inherited from her mother
must be great indeed, if a noble woman do not grow out of this
elfish child.

pearl's inevitable tendency to hover about the enigma of the
scarlet letter seemed an innate quality of her being.  from the
earliest epoch of her conscious life, she had entered upon this
as her appointed mission.  hester had often fancied that
providence had a design of justice and retribution, in endowing
the child with this marked propensity; but never, until now, had
she bethought herself to ask, whether, linked with that design,
there might not likewise be a purpose of mercy and beneficence.

 little pearl were entertained with faith and trust, as a
spirit messenger no less than an earthly child, might it not be
her errand to soothe away the sorrow that lay cold in her
mother's heart, and converted it into a tomb?--and to help her
to overcome the passion, once so wild, and even yet neither dead
nor asleep, but only imprisoned within the same tomb-like heart?

such were some of the thoughts that now stirred in hester's
mind, with as much vivacity of impression as if they had

d into her ear.  and there was little
pearl, all this while, holding her mother's hand in both her
own, and turning her face upward, while she put these searching
questions, once and again, and still a third time.

"what does the letter mean, mother?  and why dost thou wear it?
and why does the minister keep his hand over his heart?"

"what shall i say?" thought hester to herself.  "no!  if this be
the price of the child's sympathy, i cannot pay it."

then she spoke aloud--

"silly pearl," said she, "what questions are these?  there are
many things in this world that a child must not ask about.  what
know i of the minister's heart?  and as for the scarlet letter, i
wear it for the sake of its gold thread."

in all the seven bygone years, hester prynne had never before
been false to the symbol on her bosom.  it may be that it was the
talisman of a stern and severe, but yet a guardian spirit, who
now forsook her; as recognising that, in spite of his strict
watch over her heart, s

ome new evil had crept into it, or some
old one had never been expelled.  as for little pearl, the
earnestness soon passed out of her face.

but the child did not see fit to let the matter drop.  two or
three times, as her mother and she went homeward, and as often
at supper-time, and while hester was putting her to bed, and
once after she seemed to be fairly asleep, pearl looked up, with
mischief gleaming in her black eyes.

"mother," said she, "what does the scarlet letter mean?"

and the next morning, the first indication the child gave of
being awake was by popping up her head from the pillow, and
making that other enquiry, which she had so unaccountably
connected with her investigations about the scarlet letter--

"mother!--mother!--why does the minister keep his hand over his
heart?"

"hold thy tongue, naughty child!" answered her mother, with an
asperity t

 world to breathe in, while they talked
together--for all these reasons hester never thought of meeting
him in any narrower privacy than beneath the open sky.

at last, while attending a sick chamber, whither the rev.  mr.
dimmesdale had been summoned to make a prayer, she learnt that
he had gone, the day before, to visit the apostle eliot, among
his indian converts.  he would probably return by a certain hour
in the afternoon of the morrow.  betimes, therefore, the next
day, hester took little pearl--who was necessarily the companion
of all her mother's expeditions, however inconvenient her
presence--and set forth.

the road, after the two wayfarers had crossed from the peninsula
to the mainland, was no other than a foot-path.  it straggled
onward into the mystery of the primeval forest.  this hemmed it
in so narrowly, and stood so black and dense on either side, and
disclosed such imperfect glimpses of the sky above, that, to
hester's mind, it imaged not amiss the moral wilderness in whic

htly stirred, however,
by a breeze; so that a gleam of flickering sunshine might now
and then be seen at its solitary play along the path.  this
flitting cheerfulness was always at the further extremity of
some long vista through the forest.  the sportive
sunlight--feebly sportive, at best, in the predominant
pensiveness of the day and scene--withdrew itself as they came
nigh, and left the spots where it had danced the drearier,
because they had hoped to find them bright.

"mother," said little pearl, "the sunshine does not love you.

it will not flee from me--for i wear nothing on my bosom yet!"

"nor ever will, my child, i hope," said hester.

"and why not, mother?" asked pearl, stopping short, just at the
beginning of her race.  "will not it come of its own accord when
i am a woman grown?"

"run awa

it will soon be gone."

pearl set forth at a great pace, and as hester smiled to
perceive, did actually catch the sunshine, and stood laughing in
the midst of it, all brightened by its splendour, and
scintillating with the vivacity excited by rapid motion.  the
light lingered about the lonely child, as if glad of such a
playmate, until her mother had drawn almost nigh enough to step
into the magic circle too.

"it will go now," said pearl, shaking her head.

"see!" answered hester, smiling; "now i can stretch out my hand
and grasp some of it."

as she attempted to do so, the sunshine vanished; or, to judge
from the bright expression that was dancing on pearl's features,
her mother could have fancied that the child had absorbed it
into herself, and would give it forth again, with a gleam about
her path, as they should plunge into some gloomier shade.  there
was no other attribute that so much impressed her with a sense
of new and

 untransmitted vigour in pearl's nature, as this never
failing vivacity of spirits: she had not the disease of sadness,
which almost all children, in these latter days, inherit, with
the scrofula, from the troubles of their ancestors.  perhaps
this, too, was a disease, and but the reflex of the wild energy
with which hester had fought against her sorrows before pearl's
birth.  it was certainly a doubtful charm, imparting a hard,
metallic lustre to the child's character.  she wanted--what some
people want throughout life--a grief that should deeply touch
her, and thus humanise and make her capable of sympathy.  but
there was time enough yet for little pearl.

"come, my child!" said hester, looking about her from the spot
where pearl had stood still in the sunshine--"we will sit down a
little way within the wood, and rest ourselves."

"i am not aweary, mother

," replied the little girl.  "but you
may sit down, if you will tell me a story meanwhile."

"a story, child!" said hester.  "and about what?"

"oh, a story about the black man," answered pearl, taking hold
of her mother's gown, and looking up, half earnestly, half
mischievously, into her face.

"how he haunts this forest, and carries a book with him a big,
heavy book, with iron clasps; and how this ugly black man offers
his book and an iron pen to everybody that meets him here among
the trees; and they are to write their names with their own
blood; and then he sets his mark on their bosoms.  didst thou
ever meet the black man, mother?"

"and who told you this story, pearl," asked her
 
 ___________________________
 
true, mother?  and dost thou go to
meet him in the nighttime?"

"didst thou ever awake and find thy mother gone?" asked hester.
"not that i remember," said the child.  "if thou fearest to leave
me in our cottage, thou mightest take me along with thee.  i
would very gladly go!  but, mother, tell me now!  is there such a
black man?  and didst thou ever meet him?  and is this his mark?"

"wilt thou let me be at peace, if i once tell thee?" asked her
mother.

"yes, if thou tellest me all," answered pearl.

"once in my life i met the black man!" said her mother.  "this
scarlet letter is his mark!"

thus conversing, they entered sufficiently deep into the wood to
secure themselves from the observation of any casual passenger
along the forest track.  here they sat down on a luxuriant heap
of moss; which at some epoch of the preceding century, had been
a gigantic pine, with its roots and trunk in the darksome shade,
and its head aloft in the upper atmosphere.  it was a little dell
where they had se

 its never-ceasing loquacity, it should
whisper tales out of the heart of the old forest whence it
flowed, or mirror its revelations on the smooth surface of a
pool.  continually, indeed, as it stole onward, the streamlet
kept up a babble, kind, quiet, soothing, but melancholy, like
the voice of a young child that was spending its infancy without
playfulness, and knew not how to be merry among sad acquaintance
and events of sombre hue.

"oh, brook!  oh, foolish and tiresome little brook!" cried
pearl, after listening awhile to its talk, "why art thou so sad?
pluck up a spirit, and do not be all the time sighing and
murmuring!"

but the brook, in the course of its little lifetime among the
forest trees, had gone through so solemn an experience that it
could not help talking about it, and seemed to have nothing else
to say.  pearl resembled the brook, inasmuch as the current of
her life gushed from a well-spring as mysterious, and had flowed
through scenes shadowed as heavily with gloom.  but

, unlike the
little stream, she danced and sparkled, and prattled airily
along her course.

"what does this sad little brook say, mother?" inquired she.

"if thou hadst a sorrow of thine own, the brook might tell thee
of it," answered her mother, "even as it is telling me of mine.
but now, pearl, i hear a footstep along the path, and the noise
of one putting aside the branches.  i would have thee betake
thyself to play, and leave me to speak with him that comes
yonder."

"is it the black man?" asked pearl.

"wilt thou go and play, child?" repeated her mother, "but do not
stray far into the wood.  and take heed that thou come at my
first call."

"yes, mother," answered pearl, "but if it be the black man, wilt
thou not let me stay a moment, and look at him, with his big

 hester prynne.  "but do not stray far.  keep where
thou canst hear the babble of the brook."

the child went singing away, following up the current of the
brook, and striving to mingle a more lightsome cadence with its
melancholy voice.  but the little stream would not be comforted,
and still kept telling its unintelligible secret of some very
mournful mystery that had happened--or making a prophetic
lamentation about something that was yet to happen--within the
verge of the dismal forest.  so pearl, who had enough of shadow
in her own little life, chose to break off all acquaintance with
this repining brook.  she set herself, therefore, to gathering
violets and wood-anemones, and some scarlet columbines that she
found growing in the crevice of a high rock.

when her elf-child had departed, hester prynne made a step or
two towards the track that led through the forest, but still
remained under the deep shadow of the trees.  she beheld the
minister advancing along the path entirely alone, a

to do so, but would have been glad, could he be glad of
anything, to fling himself down at the root of the nearest tree,
and lie there passive for evermore.  the leaves might bestrew
him, and the soil gradually accumulate and form a little hillock
over his frame, no matter whether there were life in it or no.
death was too definite an object to be wished for or avoided.

to hester's eye, the reverend mr. dimmesdale exhibited no
symptom of positive and vivacious suffering, except that, as
little pearl had remarked, he kept his hand over his heart.



xvii.   the pastor and his parishioner

slowly as the minister walked, he had almost gone by before
hester prynne could gather voice enough to attract his
observation.  at length she succeeded.

"arthur dimmesdale!" she said, faintly at first, then louder,
but hoarsely--"arthur dimmesdale!"

"who speaks?" answered the minister.  gathering himself quickly
up, he stood more erect, like a man taken by surprise in a mood
to which he was reluctant to

 slow, reluctant necessity, that arthur
dimmesdale put forth his hand, chill as death, and touched the
chill hand of hester prynne.  the grasp, cold as it was, took
away what was dreariest in the interview.  they now felt
themselves, at least, inhabitants of the same sphere.

without a word more spoken--neither he nor she assuming the
guidance, but with an unexpressed consent--they glided back into
the shadow of the woods whence hester had emerged, and sat down
on the heap of moss where she and pearl had before been sitting.
when they found voice to speak, it was at first only to utter
remarks and inquiries such as any two acquaintances might have
made, about the gloomy sky, the threatening storm, and, next,
the health of each.  thus they went onward, not boldly, but step
by step, into the themes that were brooding deepest in their
hearts.  so long estranged by fate and circumstances, they needed
something slight and casual to run before and throw open the
doors of intercourse, so that thei

t wild, heathen nature of
the forest, never subjugated by human law, nor illumined by
higher truth--with the bliss of these two spirits!  love, whether
newly-born, or aroused from a death-like slumber, must always
create a sunshine, filling the heart so full of radiance, that
it overflows upon the outward world.  had the forest still kept
its gloom, it would have been bright in hester's eyes, and
bright in arthur dimmesdale's!

hester looked at him with a thrill of another joy.

"thou must know pearl!" said she.  "our little pearl!  thou hast
seen her--yes, i know it!--but thou wilt see her now with other
eyes.  she is a strange child!  i hardly comprehend her!  but thou
wilt love her dearly, as i do, and wilt advise me how to deal
with her!"

"dost thou think the child will be glad to know me?" asked the
minister, somewhat uneasily.  "i have long shrunk from children,
because they often show a distrust--a backwardness to be
familiar with me.  i have even been afraid of little pearl!"

"ah,

 that was sad!" answered the mother.  "but she will love
thee dearly, and thou her.  she is not far off.  i will call her.
pearl!  pearl!"

"i see the child," observed the minister.  "yonder she is,
standing in a streak of sunshine, a good way off, on the other
side of the brook.  so thou thinkest the child will love me?"

hester smiled, and again called to pearl, who was visible at
some distance, as the minister had described her, like a
bright-apparelled vision in a sunbeam, which fell down upon her
through an arch of boughs.  the ray quivered to and fro, making
her figure dim or distinct--now like a real child, now like a
child's spirit--as the splendour went and came again.  she heard
her mother's voice, and approached slowly through the forest.

pearl had not found the hour pass wearisomely while her mother
sat talking with the clergyman.  the grea

it showed itself to those who brought the guilt and troubles of
the world into its bosom--became the playmate of the lonely
infant, as well as it knew how.  sombre as it was, it put on the
kindest of its moods to welcome her.  it offered her the
partridge-berries, the growth of the preceding autumn, but
ripening only in the spring, and now red as drops of blood upon
the withered leaves.  these pearl gathered, and was pleased with
their wild flavour.  the small denizens of the wilderness hardly
took pains to move out of her path.  a partridge, indeed, with a
brood of ten behind her, ran forward threateningly, but soon
repented of her fierceness, and clucked to her young ones not to
be afraid.  a pigeon, alone on a low branch, allowed pearl to
come beneath, and uttered a sound as much of greeting as alarm.

erriment--for the squirrel is such
a choleric and humorous little personage, that it is hard to
distinguish between his moods--so he chattered at the child, and
flung down a nut upon her head.  it was a last year's nut, and
already gnawed by his sharp tooth.  a fox, startled from his
sleep by her light footstep on the leaves, looked inquisitively
at pearl, as doubting whether it were better to steal off, or
renew his nap on the same spot.  a wolf, it is said--but here the
tale has surely lapsed into the improbable--came up and smelt of
pearl's robe, and offered his savage head to be patted by her
hand.  the truth seems to be, however, that the mother-forest,
and these wild things which it nourished, all recognised a
kindred wilderness in the human child.

other's cottage.  the bowers appeared
to know it, and one and another whispered as she passed, "adorn
thyself with me, thou beautiful child, adorn thyself with
me!"--and, to please them, pearl gathered the violets, and
anemones, and columbines, and some twigs of the freshest green,
which the old trees held down before her eyes.  with these she
decorated her hair and her young waist, and became a nymph
child, or an infant dryad, or whatever else was in closest
sympathy with the antique wood.  in such guise had pearl adorned
herself, when she heard her mother's voice, and came slowly
back.

the minister sat watching little pearl.  "dost thou not think her
beautiful?  and see with what natural skill she has made those
simple flowers adorn her!  had she gathered pearls, and diamonds,
and rubies in the wood, they could not have become her better!
she is a splendid child!  but i know whose brow she has!"

"dost thou know, hester," said arthur dimmesdale, with an
unquiet smile, "that this dear child, tripping about always at
thy side, hath caused me many an alarm?  methought--oh, hester,
what a thought is that, and how terrible to dread it!--that my
own features were partly repeated in her face, and so strikingly
that the world might see them!  but she is mostl

"no, no!  not mostly!" answered the mother, with a tender smile.
"a little longer, and thou needest not to be afraid to trace
whose child she is.  but how strangely beautiful she looks with
those wild flowers in her hair!  it is as if one of the fairies,
whom we left in dear old england, had decked her out to meet
us."

it was with a feeling which neither of them had ever before
experienced, that they sat and watched pearl's slow advance.  in
her was visible the tie that united them.  she had been offered
to the world, these seven past years, as the living
hieroglyphic, in which was revealed the secret they so darkly
sought to hide--all written in this symbol--all plainly
manifest--had there been a prophet or magician skilled to read
the character of flame!  and pearl was the oneness of their
being.  be the foregone evil what it might, how could they doubt
that their earthly lives and future destinies were conjoi

when they beheld at once the material union, and the spiritual
idea, in whom they met, and were to dwell immortally together;
thoughts like these--and perhaps other thoughts, which they did
not acknowledge or define--threw an awe about the child as she
came onward.

"let her see nothing strange--no passion or eagerness--in thy
way of accosting her," whispered hester.  "our pearl is a fitful
and fantastic little elf sometimes.  especially she is generally
intolerant of emotion, when she does not fully comprehend the
why and wherefore.  but the child hath strong affections!  she
loves me, and will love thee!"

"thou canst not think," said the minister, glancing aside at
hester prynne, "how my heart dreads this interview, and yearns
for it!  but, in truth, as i already told thee, children are not
readily won to be familiar with me.  they will not climb my knee,

stern old governor."

"and thou didst plead so bravely in her behalf and mine!"
answered the mother.  "i remember it; and so shall little pearl.
fear nothing.  she may be strange and shy at first, but will soon
learn to love thee!"

by this time pearl had reached the margin of the brook, and
stood on the further side, gazing silently at hester and the
clergyman, who still sat together on the mossy tree-trunk
waiting to receive her.  just where she had paused, the brook
chanced to form a pool so smooth and quiet that it reflected a
perfect image of her little figure, with all the brilliant
picturesqueness of her beauty, in its adornment
 
 ___________________________
 
 of flowers and
wreathed foliage, but more refined and spiritualized than the
reality.  this image, so nearly identical with the living pearl,
seemed to communicate somewhat of its own shadowy and intangible
quality to the child herself.  it was strange, the way in which
pearl stood, looking so steadfastly at them through the dim
medium of the forest gloom, herself, meanwhile, all glorified
with a ray of sunshine, that was attracted thitherward as by a
certain sympathy.  in the brook beneath stood another
child--another and the same--with likewise its ray of golden
light.  hester felt herself, in some indistinct and tantalizing
manner, estranged from pearl, as if the child, in her lonely
ramble through the forest, had strayed out of the sphere in
which she and her mo

ther dwelt together, and was now vainly
seeking to return to it.

there were both truth and error in the impression; the child and
mother were estranged, but through hester's fault, not pearl's.
since the latter rambled from her side, another inmate had been
admitted within the circle of the mother's feelings, and so
modified the aspect of them all, that pearl, the returning
wanderer, could not find her wonted place, and hardly knew where
she was.

"i have a strange fancy," observed the sensitive minister, "that
this brook is the boundary between two worlds, and that thou
canst never meet thy pearl again.  or is she an elfish spirit,
who, as the legends of our childhood taught us, is forbidden to
cross a running stream?  pray hasten her, for this delay has
already imparted a tremor to my nerves."

"come, dearest child!" said hester encouragingly, and

 stretching
out both her arms.  "how slow thou art!  when hast thou been so
sluggish before now?  here is a friend of mine, who must be thy
friend also.  thou wilt have twice as much love henceforward as
thy mother alone could give thee!  leap across the brook and come
to us.  thou canst leap like a young deer!"

pearl, without responding in any manner to these honey-sweet
expressions, remained on the other side of the brook.  now she
fixed her bright wild eyes on her mother, now on the minister,
and now included them both in the same glance, as if to detect
and explain to herself the relation which they bore to one
another.  for some unaccountable reason, as arthur dimmesdale
felt the child's eyes upon himself, his hand--with that gesture
so habitual as to have become involuntary--stole over his heart.
at le

ngth, assuming a singular air of authority, pearl stretched
out her hand, with the small forefinger extended, and pointing
evidently towards her mother's breast.  and beneath, in the
mirror of the brook, there was the flower-girdled and sunny
image of little pearl, pointing her small forefinger too.

"thou strange child!  why dost thou not come to me?" exclaimed
hester.

pearl still pointed with her forefinger, and a frown gathered on
her brow--the more impressive from the childish, the almost
baby-like aspect of the features that conveyed it.  as her mother
still kept beckoning to her, and arraying her face in a holiday
suit of unaccustomed smiles, the child stamped her foot with a
yet more imperious look and gesture.  in the brook, again, was
the fantastic beauty of the image, with its reflected frown, its
pointed finger, and imperious gesture, giving emphasis to t

aspect of little pearl.

"hasten, pearl, or i shall be angry with thee!" cried hester
prynne, who, however, inured to such behaviour on the
elf-child's part at other seasons, was naturally anxious for a
more seemly deportment now.  "leap across the brook, naughty
child, and run hither!  else i must come to thee!"

but pearl, not a whit startled at her mother's threats any more
than mollified by her entreaties, now suddenly burst into a fit
of passion, gesticulating violently, and throwing her small
figure into the most extravagant contortions.  she accompanied
this wild outbreak with piercing shrieks, which the woods
reverberated on all sides, so that, alone as she was in her
childish and unreasonable wrath, it seemed as if a hidden
multitude were lending her their sympathy and encouragement.

e more was the shadowy wrath of pearl's
image, crowned and girdled with flowers, but stamping its foot,
wildly gesticulating, and, in the midst of all, still pointing
its small forefinger at hester's bosom.

"i see what ails the child," whispered hester to the clergyman,
and turning pale in spite of a strong effort to conceal her
trouble and annoyance, "children will not abide any, the
slightest, change in the accustomed aspect of things that are
daily before their eyes.  pearl misses something that she has
always seen me wear!"

"i pray you," answered the minister, "if thou hast any means of
pacifying the child, do it forthwith!  save it were the cankered
wrath of an old witch like mistress hibbins," added he,
attempting to smile, "i know nothing that i would not sooner
encounter than this passion in a child.  in pearl's young beauty,
as in the wrinkled witch, it has a preternatural effect.  pacify
her if thou lovest me!"

hester turned again towards pearl with a cri

cheek, a conscious glance aside clergyman, and then a heavy
sigh, while, even before she had time to speak, the blush
yielded to a deadly pallor.

"pearl," said she sadly, "look down at thy feet!  there!--before
thee!--on the hither side of the brook!"

the child turned her eyes to the point indicated, and there lay
the scarlet letter so close upon the margin of the stream that
the gold embroidery was reflected in it.

"bring it hither!" said hester.

"come thou and take it up!" answered pearl.

"was ever such a child!" observed hester aside to the minister.
"oh, i have much to tell thee about her!  but, in very truth, she
is right as regards th

again was the scarlet misery
glittering on the old spot!  so it ever is, whether thus typified
or no, that an evil deed invests itself with the character of
doom.  hester next gathered up the heavy tresses of her hair and
confined them beneath her cap.  as if there were a withering
spell in the sad letter, her beauty, the warmth and richness of
her womanhood, departed like fading sunshine, and a gray shadow
seemed to fall across her.

when the dreary change was wrought, she extended her hand to
pearl.

"dost thou know thy mother now, child?", asked she,
reproachfully, but with a subdued tone.  "wilt thou come across
the brook, and own thy mother, now that she has her shame upon
her--now that she is sad?"

"yes; now i will!" answered the child, bounding across the
brook, and clasping hester in her arms "now thou art my mother
indeed! and i am thy little pearl!"

in a mood of tenderness that was not usual with her, she drew
down her mother's head, and kissed her brow and both her cheeks.
but

then--by a kind of necessity that always impelled this child
to alloy whatever comfort she might chance to give with a throb
of anguish--pearl put up her mouth and kissed the scarlet
letter, too.

"that was not kind!" said hester.  "when thou hast shown me a
little love, thou mockest me!"

"why doth the minister sit yonder?" asked pearl.

"he waits to welcome thee," replied her mother.  "come thou, and
entreat his blessing!  he loves thee, my little pearl, and loves
thy mother, too.  wilt thou not love him?  come he longs to greet
thee!"

"doth he love us?" said pearl, looking up with acute
intelligence into her mother's face.  "will he go back with us,
hand in hand, we three together, into the town?"

"not now, my child," answered hester.  "but in days to come he
will walk hand in hand with us.  we will have a home and fireside
of our own; and thou shalt sit upon his knee; and he will teach
thee many things, and love thee dearly.  thou wilt lov

e him--wilt
thou not?"

"and will he always keep his hand over his heart?" inquired
pearl.

"foolish child, what a question is that!" exclaimed her mother.
"come, and ask his blessing!"

but, whether influenced by the jealousy that seems instinctive
with every petted child towards a dangerous rival, or from
whatever caprice of her freakish nature, pearl would show no
favour to the clergyman.  it was only by an exertion of force
that her mother brought her up to him, hanging back, and
manifesting her reluctance by odd grimaces; of which, ever since
her babyhood, she had possessed a singular variety, and could
transform her mobile physiognomy into a series of different
aspects, with a new mischief in them, each and all.  the

rds--bent forward, and impressed one on her brow.  hereupon,
pearl broke away from her mother, and, running to the brook,
stooped over it, and bathed her forehead, until the unwelcome
kiss was quite washed off and diffused through a long lapse of
the gliding water.  she then remained apart, silently watching
hester and the clergyman; while they talked together and made
such arrangements as were suggested by their new position and
the purposes soon to be fulfilled.

and now this fateful interview had come to a close.  the dell
was to be left in solitude among i

ts dark, old trees, which,
with their multitudinous tongues, would whisper long of what had
passed there, and no mortal be the wiser.  and the melancholy
brook would add this other tale to the mystery with which its
little heart was already overburdened, and whereof it still kept
up a murmuring babble, with not a whit more cheerfulness of tone
than for ages heretofore.



xx.  the minister in a maze

as the minister departed, in advance of hester prynne and little
pearl, he threw a backward glance, half expecting that he should
discover only some faintly traced features or outline of the
mother and the child, slowly fading into the twilight of the
woods.  so great a vicissitude in his life could not at once be
received as real.  but there was hester, clad in her gray robe,
still standing beside the tree-trunk, which some blast had
overthrown a long antiquity ago, and which time had ever since
been covering with moss, so that these two fated ones, with
earth's

heaviest burden on them, might there sit down together,
and find a single hour's rest and solace.  and there was pearl,
too, lightly dancing from the margin of the brook--now that the
intrusive third person was gone--and taking her old place by her
mother's side.  so the minister had not fallen asleep and
dreamed!

in order to free his mind from this indistinctness and duplicity
of impression, which vexed it with a strange disquietude, he
recalled and more thoroughly defined the plans which hester and
himself had sketched for their departure.  it had been determined
between them that the old world, with its cro

careering on it; morning came, and peeped, blushing, through the
curtains; and at last sunrise threw a golden beam into the
study, and laid it right across the minister's bedazzled eyes.
there he was, with the pen still between his fingers, and a
vast, immeasurable tract of written space behind him!



xxi.  the new england holiday

betimes in the morning of the day on which the new governor was
to receive his office at the hands of the people, hester prynne
and little pearl came into the market-place.  it was already
thronged with the craftsmen and other plebeian inhabitants of
the town, in considerable numbers, among whom, likewise, were
many rough figures, whose attire of deer-skins marked them as
belonging to some of the forest settlements, which surrounded
the little metropolis of the colony.

on this public holiday, as on all other occasions for seven
years past, hester was clad in a garment of coarse gray cloth.
not more by its hue than by some indescribable

h her being.  might there
not be an irresistible desire to quaff a last, long, breathless
draught of the cup of wormwood and aloes, with which nearly all
her years of womanhood had been perpetually flavoured.  the wine
of life, henceforth to be presented to her lips, must be indeed
rich, delicious, and exhilarating, in its chased and golden
beaker, or else leave an inevitable and weary languor, after the
lees of bitterness wherewith she had been drugged, as with a
cordial of intensest potency.

pearl was decked out with airy gaiety.  it would have been
impossible to guess that this bright and sunny apparition owed
its existence to the shape of gloomy gray; or that a fancy, at
once so gorgeous and so delicate as must have been requisite to
contrive the child's apparel, was the same that had achieved a
task perhaps more difficult, in imparting so distinct a
peculiarity to hester's simple robe.  the dress, so proper was it
to little pearl, seemed an effluence, or inevitable development
and out

garb was all of
one idea with her nature.  on this eventful day, moreover, there
was a certain singular inquietude and excitement in her mood,
resembling nothing so much as the shimmer of a diamond, that
sparkles and flashes with the varied throbbings of the breast on
which it is displayed.  children have always a sympathy in the
agitations of those connected with them: always, especially, a
sense of any trouble or impending revolution, of whatever kind,
in domestic circumstances; and therefore pearl, who was the gem
on her mother's unquiet bosom, betrayed, by the very dance of
her spirits, the emotions which none could detect in the marble
passiveness of hester's brow.

this effervescence made her flit with a bird-like movement,
rather than walk by her mother's side.

she broke continually into shouts of a wild, inarticulate, and
sometimes piercing music.  when they reached the market-place,
she became still more restless, on perceiving the stir and
bustle that enlivened the spot; for it w

their work to-day?  is it a play-day for the whole
world?  see, there is the blacksmith!  he has washed his sooty
face, and put on his sabbath-day clothes, and looks as if he
would gladly be merry, if any kind body would only teach him
how!  and there is master brackett, the old jailer, nodding and
smiling at me.  why does he do so, mother?"

"he remembers thee a little babe, my child," answered hester.

"he should not nod and smile at me, for all that--the black,
grim, ugly-eyed old man!" said pearl.  "he may nod at thee, if he
will; for thou art clad in gray, and wearest the scarlet letter.
but see, mother, how many faces of strange people, and indians
among them, and sailors!  what have they all come to do, here in
the market-place?"

"they wait to see the procession pass," said hester.  "for the
governor and the magistrates are to go by, and the ministers,
and all the great people and good people, with the music and the
soldiers marching before them."

"and will the minister be there?"

asked pearl.  "and will he
hold out both his hands to me, as when thou ledst me to him
from the brook-side?"

"he will be there, child," answered her mother, "but he will not
greet thee to-day, nor must thou greet him."

"what a strange, sad man is he!" said the child, as if speaking
partly to herself.  "in the dark nighttime he calls us to him,
and holds thy hand and mine, as when we stood with him on the
scaffold yonder!  and in the deep forest, where only the old
trees can hear, and the strip of sky see

 it, he talks with thee,
sitting on a heap of moss!  and he kisses my forehead, too, so
that the little brook would hardly wash it off!  but, here, in
the sunny day, and among all the people, he knows us not; nor
must we know him!  a strange, sad man is he, with his hand always
over his heart!"

"be quiet, pearl--thou understandest not these things," said her
mother.  "think not now of the minister, but look about thee, and
see how cheery is everybody's face to-day.  the children have
come from their schools, and the grown people from their
workshops and their fields, on purpose to be happy, for, to-day,
a new man is beginning to rule over them; and so--as has been
the custom of mankind ever since a nation was first
gathered--they make merry and rejoice: as if a good and golden
year were at length to p

on.

soon the head of the procession showed itself, with a slow and
stately march, turning a corner, and making its way across the
market-place.  first came the music.  it comprised a variety of
instruments, perhaps imperfectly adapted to one another, and
played with no great skill; but yet attaining the great object
for which the harmony of drum and clarion addresses itself to
the multitude--that of imparting a higher and more heroic air to
the scene of life that passes before the eye.  little pearl at
first clapped her hands, but then lost for an instant the
restless agitation that had kept her in a continual
effervescence throughout the morning; she gazed silently, and
seemed to be borne upward like a floating sea-bird on the long
heaves and swells of sound.  but she was brought back to her
former mood by the shimmer of the sunshine on the weapons and
bright armour of the military company, which followed after the
music, and formed the honorary escort of the procession.  this
body of sol

with the idea that all must have been a delusion,
and that, vividly as she had dreamed it, there could be no real
bond betwixt the clergyman and herself.  and thus much of woman
was there in hester, that she could scarcely forgive him--least
of all now, when the heavy footstep of their approaching fate
might be heard, nearer, nearer, nearer!--for being able so
completely to withdraw himself from their mutual world--while
she groped darkly, and stretched forth her cold hands, and found
him not.

pearl either saw and responded to her mother's feelings, or
herself felt the remoteness and intangibility that had fallen
around the minister.  while the procession passed, the child was
uneasy, fluttering up and down, like a bird on the point of
taking flight.  when the whole had gone by, she looked up into
hester's face--

"mother," said she, "was that the same minister that kissed me
by the brook?"

"hold thy peace, dear little pearl!" whispered her mother.  "we
must not always talk in the marketp

lace of what happens to us in
the forest."

"i could not be sure that it was he--so strange he looked,"
continued the child.  "else i would have run to him, and bid him
kiss me now, before all the people, even as he did yonder among
the dark old trees.  what would the minister have said, mother?
would he have clapped his hand over his heart, and scowled on
me, and bid me begone?"

"what should he say, pearl," answered hester, "save that it was
no time to kiss, and that kisses are not to be given in the
market-place?  well for thee, foolish child, that thou didst not
speak to him!"

another shade of the same sentiment, in reference to mr.
dimmesdale, was expressed by a person whose
eccentricities--insanity, as we should term it--led her to do
what few of the townspeople would have ventured on--to begin a
conversation with the wearer of the scarlet letter in public.  it
was mistress hibbins, who, ar

here need be no question about that.  but this minister!  let me
tell thee in thine ear!  when the black man sees one of his own
servants, signed and sealed, so shy of owning to the bond as is
the reverend mr. dimmesdale, he hath a way of ordering matters
so that the mark shall be disclosed, in open daylight, to the
eyes of all the world!  what is that the minister seeks to hide,
with his hand always over his heart?  ha, hester prynne?"

"what is it, good mistress hibbins?" eagerly asked little pearl.
"hast thou seen it?"

"no matter, darling!" responded mistress hibbins, making pearl a
profound reverence.  "thou thyself wilt see it, one time or
another.  they say, child, thou art of the lineage of the prince
of air!  wilt thou ride with me some fine night to see thy
father?  then thou shalt know wherefore the minister keeps his
hand over his heart!"

laughing so shrilly that all the market-place could hear her,
the weird old gentlewoman took her departure.

by this time the preliminary pra

ower.

during all this time, hester stood, statue-like, at the foot of
the scaffold.  if the minister's voice had not kept her there,
there would, nevertheless, have been an inevitable magnetism in
that spot, whence she dated the first hour of her life of
ignominy.  there was a sense within her--too ill-defined to be
made a thought, but weighing heavily on her mind--that her whole
orb of life, both before and after, was connected with this
spot, as with the one point that gave it unity.

little pearl, meanwhile, had quitted her mother's side, and was
playing at her own will about the market-place.  she made the
sombre crowd cheerful by her erratic and glistening ray, even as
a bird of bright plumage illuminates a whole tree of dusky
foliage by darting to and fro, half seen and half concealed amid
the twilight of the clustering leaves.  she had an undulating,
but oftentimes a sharp and irregular movement.  it indicated the
restless vivacity of her spirit, which to-day was doubly

e in its tip-toe dance, because it was played upon
and vibrated with her mother's disquietude.  whenever pearl saw
anything to excite her ever active and wandering curiosity, she
flew thitherward, and, as we might say, seized upon that man or
thing as her own property, so far as she desired it, but without
yielding the minutest degree of control over her motions in
requital.  the puritans looked on, and, if they smiled, were none
the less inclined to pronounce the child a demon offspring, from
the indescribable charm of beauty and eccentricity that shone
through her little figure, and sparkled with its

activity.  she
ran and looked the wild indian in the face, and he grew
conscious of a nature wilder than his own.  thence, with native
audacity, but still with a reserve as characteristic, she flew
into the midst of a group of mariners, the swarthy-cheeked wild
men of the ocean, as the indians were of the land; and they
gazed wonderingly and admiringly at pearl, as if a flake of the
sea-foam had taken the shape of a little maid, and were gifted
with a soul of the sea-fire, that flashes beneath the prow in
the night-time.

one of these seafaring men the shipmaster, indeed, who had
spoken to hester prynne was so smitten with pearl's aspect, that
he attempted to lay hands upon her, with purpose to snatch a
kiss.  finding it as impossible to touch her as to catch a
humming-bird in the air, he took from his hat the gold chain
that was twisted about it, and

 threw it to the child.  pearl
immediately twined it around her neck and waist with such happy
skill, that, once seen there, it became a part of her, and it
was difficult to imagine her without it.

"thy mother is yonder woman with the scarlet letter," said the
seaman, "wilt thou carry her a message from me?"

"if the message pleases me, i will," answered pearl.

"then tell her," rejoined he, "that i spake again with the
black-a-visaged, hump shouldered old doctor, and he engages to
bring his friend, the gentleman she wots of, aboard with him.  so
let thy mother take no thought, save for herself and thee.  wilt
thou tell her this, thou witch-baby?"

"mistress hibbins says my father is the prince of the air!"
cried pearl, with a naughty smile.  "if thou callest me that
ill-name, i shall tell him of thee, and he will chase thy ship
with a tempest!"

s arm.  he still walked onward,
if that movement could be so described, which rather resembled
the wavering effort of an infant, with its mother's arms in
view, outstretched to tempt him forward.  and now, almost
imperceptible as were the latter steps of his progress, he had
come opposite the well-remembered and weather-darkened scaffold,
where, long since, with all that dreary lapse of time between,
hester prynne had encountered the world's ignominious stare.
there stood hester, holding little pearl by the hand!  and there
was the scarlet letter on her breast!  the minister here made a
pause; although the music still played the stately and rejoicing
march to which the procession moved.  it summoned him
onward--inward to the festival!--but here he made a pause.

bellingham, for the last few moments, had kept an anxious eye
upon him.  he now left his own place in the procession, and
advanced to give assistance judging, from mr. dimmesdale's
aspect that he must otherwise inevitably fall.  but

imations that pass from one spirit to another.  the crowd,
meanwhile, looked on with awe and wonder.  this earthly
faintness, was, in their view, only another phase of the
minister's celestial strength; nor would it have seemed a
miracle too high to be wrought for one so holy, had he ascended
before their eyes, waxing dimmer and brighter, and fading at
last into the light of heaven!

he turned towards the scaffold, and stretched forth his arms.

"hester," said he, "come hither!  come, my little pearl!"

it was a ghastly look with which he regarded them; but there was
something at once tender and strangely triumphant in it.  the
child, with the bird-like motion, which was one of her
characteristics, flew to him, and clasped her arms about his
knees.  hester prynne--slowly, as if impelled by inevitable fate,
and against her strongest will--likewise drew near, but paused
before she reached him.  at this instant old roger chillingworth
thrust himself through the crowd--or, perhaps, so dark,

lace nor lowly place, where thou couldst have escaped me--save
on this very scaffold!"

"thanks be to him who hath led me hither!" answered the
minister.

yet he trembled, and turned to hester, with an expression of
doubt and anxiety in his eyes, not the less evidently betrayed,
that there was a feeble smile upon his lips.

"is not this better," murmured he, "than what we dreamed of in
the forest?"

"i know not!  i know not!" she hurriedly replied.  "better?  yea;
so we may both die, and little pearl die with us!"

"for thee and pearl, be it as god shall order," said the
minister; "and god is merciful!  let me now do the will which he
hath made plain before my sight.  for, hester, i am a dying man.
so let me make haste to take my shame upon me!"

partly supported by hester prynne, and holding one hand of
little pearl's, the reverend mr. dimmesdale turned to the
dignified and venerable rulers; to the holy ministers, who were
his brethren; to the people, whose great heart was thoroughly
appal

ictory.  then, down he sank upon the scaffold!  hester partly
raised him, and supported his head against her bosom.  old roger
chillingworth knelt down beside him, with a blank, dull
countenance, out of which the life seemed to have departed.

"thou hast escaped me!" he repeated more than once.  "thou hast
escaped me!"

"may god forgive thee!" said the minister.  "thou, too, hast
deeply sinned!"

he withdrew his dying eyes from the old man, and fixed them on
the woman and the child.

"my little pearl," said he, feebly and there was a sweet and
gentle smile over his face, as of a spirit sinking into deep
repose; nay, now that the burden was removed, it seemed almost
as if he would be sportive with the child--"dear little pearl,
wilt thou kiss me now?  thou wouldst not, yonder, in the forest!
but now thou wilt?"

pearl kissed his lips.  a spell was broken.  the great scene of
grief, in which the wild infant bore a part had developed all
her sympathies; and as her tears fell upon her father's

cheek,
they were the pledge that she would grow up amid human joy and
sorrow, nor forever do battle with the world, but be a woman in
it.  towards her mother, too, pearl's errand as a messenger of
anguish was fulfilled.

"hester," said the clergyman, "farewell!"

"shall we not meet again?" whispered she, bending her face down
close to his.  "shall we not spend our immortal life together?
surely, surely, we have ransomed one another, with all this woe!
thou lookest far into eternity, with those bright dying eyes!
then tell me what thou seest!"

"hush, hester--hush!" said he, with tremulous solemnity.  "the
law we broke!--the sin here awfully revealed!--let these

r--mutual victims as they have
been--may, unawares, have found their earthly stock of hatred
and antipathy transmuted into golden love.

leaving this discussion apart, we have a matter of business to
communicate to the reader.  at old roger chillingworth's decease,
(which took place within the year), and by his last will and
testament, of which governor bellingham and the reverend mr.
wilson were executors, he bequeathed a very considerable amount
of property, both here and in england to little pearl, the
daughter of hester prynne.

so pearl--the elf child--the demon offspring, as some people up
to that epoch persisted in considering her--became the richest
heiress of her day in the new world.  not improbably this
circumstance wrought a very material change in the public
estimation; and had the mother and child remained here, little
pearl at a marriageable period of life might have mingled her
wild blood with the lineage of the devoutest puritan among them
all.  but, in no long time after t

he physician's death, the
wearer of the scarlet letter disappeared, and pearl along with
her.  for many years, though a vague report would now and then
find its way across the sea--like a shapeless piece of driftwood
tossed ashore with the initials of a name upon it--yet no
tidings of them unquestionably authentic were received.  the
story of the scarlet letter grew into a legend.  its spell,
however, was still potent, and kept the scaffold awful where the
poor minister had died, and likewise the cottage by the
sea-shore where hester prynne had dwelt.  near this latter s

or she glided shadow-like through these impediments--and, at all
events, went in.

on the threshold she paused--turned partly round--for perchance
the idea of entering alone and all so changed, the home of so
intense a former life, was more dreary and desolate than even
she could bear.  but her hesitation was only for an instant,
though long enough to display a scarlet letter on her breast.

and hester prynne had returned, and taken up her long-forsaken
shame!  but where was little pearl? if still alive she must now
have been in the flush and bloom of early womanhood.  none
knew--nor ever learned with the fulness of perfect
certainty--whether the elf-child had gone thus untimely to a
maiden grave; or whether her wild, rich nature had been softened
and subdued and made capable of a woman's gentle happiness.  but
through the remainder of hester's life there were indications
that the recluse of the scarlet letter was the object of love
and interest with some inhabitant of another

al remembrance, that must have been wrought by delicate
fingers at the impulse of a fond heart.  and once hester was seen
embroidering a baby-garment with such a lavish richness of
golden fancy as would have raised a public tumult had any infant
thus apparelled, been shown to our sober-hued community.

in fine, the gossips of that day believed--and mr. surveyor pue,
who made investigations a century later, believed--and one of
his recent successors in office, moreover, faithfully
believes--that pearl was not only alive, but married, and happy,
and mindful of her mother; and that she would most joyfully have
entertained that sad and lonely mother at her fireside.

but there was a more real life for hester prynne, here, in new
england, than in that unknown region where pearl had found a
home.  here had been her sin; here, her sorrow; and here was yet
to be her penitence.  she had returned, therefore, and resumed--of
her own free will, for not the sternest magistrate of that iron
period would
