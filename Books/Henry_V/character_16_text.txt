we doubt not of a faire and luckie warre,

this dangerous treason, lurking in our way,

but euery rubbe is smoothed on our way.
then forth, deare countreymen: let vs deliuer
our puissance into the hand of god,

bardolphs nose, and a said it was a blacke soule burning
in hell

that's all the riches i got in his seruice

ow to warre. and you good yeomen,
whose lyms were made in england; shew vs here
the mettell of your pasture: let vs sweare,
that you are worth your breeding: which i doubt not:
for there is none of you so meane and base,
that hath not noble luster in your eyes.
i see you stand like grey-hounds in the slips,
straying vpon the start. the game's afoot:
follow your spirit; and vpon this charge,
cry, god for harry, england, and s[aint]. george.

hot: and for mine owne part, i haue not a case of liues:
the humor of it is too hot, that is the very plaine-song
of it

   pist. the plaine-song is most iust: for humors doe abound:
knocks goe and come: gods vassals drop and
dye: and sword and shield, in bloody field, doth winne
immortall fame

  boy. as young as i am, i haue obseru'd these three
swashers: i am boy to them all three, but all they three,
though they would serue me, could not be man to me;
for indeed three such antiques doe not amount to a man:
for bardolph, hee is white-liuer'd, and red-fac'd; by the
meanes whereof, a faces it out, but fights not: for pistoll,
hee hath a killing tongue, and a quiet sword; by the
meanes whereof, a breakes words, and keepes whole
weapons: for nim, hee hath heard, that men of few
words are the best men, and therefore hee scornes to say
his prayers, lest a should be thought a coward: but his
few bad words are matcht with as few good deeds; for
a neuer broke any mans head but his owne, and that was
against a

post, when he was drunke. they will steale any
thing, and call it purchase. bardolph stole a lute-case,
bore it twelue leagues, and sold it for three halfepence.
nim and bardolph are sworne brothers in filching: and
in callice they stole a fire-shouell. i knew by that peece
of seruice, the men would carry coales. they would
haue me as familiar with mens pockets, as their gloues
or their hand-kerchers: which makes much against my
manhood, if i should take from anothers pocket, to put
into mine; for it is plaine pocketting vp of wrongs.
i must leaue them, and seeke some better seruice: their
villany goes against my weake stomacke, and therefore
i must cast it vp.

 pridge, i thinke in my very
conscience hee is as valiant a man as marke anthony, and
hee is a man of no estimation in the world, but i did see
him doe as gallant seruice

   pist. bardolph, a souldier firme and sound of heart,
and of buxome valour, hath by cruell fate, and giddie
fortunes furious fickle wheele, that goddesse blind, that
stands vpon the rolling restlesse stone

   flu. by your patience, aunchient pistoll: fortune is
painted blinde, with a muffler afore his eyes, to signifie
to you, that fortune is blinde; and shee is painted also
with a wheele, to signifie to you, which is the morall of
it, that shee is turning and inconstant, and mutabilitie,

   pist. fortune is bardolphs foe, and frownes on him:
for he hath stolne a pax, and hanged must a be: a damned
death: let gallowes gape for dogge, let man goe free,
and let not hempe his wind-pipe suffocate: but exeter
hath giuen the doome of death, for pax of little price.
therefore goe speake, the duke will heare thy voyce;

his life, and i will thee requite

ooke you, and there is gallant and most praue
passages: marry, th' athuersarie was haue possession of
the pridge, but he is enforced to retyre, and the duke of
exeter is master of the pridge: i can tell your maiestie,
the duke is a praue man

   king. what men haue you lost, fluellen?
  flu. the perdition of th' athuersarie hath beene very
great, reasonnable great: marry for my part, i thinke the
duke hath lost neuer a man, but one that is like to be executed
for robbing a church, one bardolph, if your maiestie
know the man: his face is all bubukles and whelkes,
and knobs, and flames a fire, and his lippes blowes at his
nose, and it is like a coale of fire, sometimes plew, and
sometimes red, but his nose is executed, and his fire's
out
