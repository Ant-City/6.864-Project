 was pitching the chill abominations into the bath-tub, pleased by
the vindictiveness of that desolate flapping sound; and in the midst his
wife serenely trotted in, observed serenely, "why georgie dear, what are
you doing? are you going to wash out the towels? why, you needn't wash
out the towels. oh, georgie, you didn't go and use the guest-towel, did
you?"

it is not recorded that he was able to answer.

for the first time in weeks he was sufficiently roused by his wife to
look at her.

myra babbitt--mrs. george f. babbitt--was definitely mature. she had
creases from the corners of her mouth to the bottom of her chin, and her
plump neck bagged. but the thing that marked her as having passed the
line was that she no longer had reticences before her husband, and no
longer worried about not having reticences. she was in a petticoat now,
and corsets which bulged, and unaware of being seen in bulgy corsets.
she had become so dully habituated to married life that in her full
matronliness she was

mrs. babbitt turned toward them with yearning sweetness; frink hastened
to finish even his best beer-recipe; and she said gaily, "dinner is
served."

there was a good deal of friendly argument among the men as to which
should go in last, and while they were crossing the hall from the
living-room to the dining-room vergil gunch made them laugh by
thundering, "if i can't sit next to myra babbitt and hold her hand under

embarrassed while mrs. babbitt fluttered, "now, let me see--oh, i was
going to have some nice hand-painted place-cards for you but--oh, let me
see; mr. frink, you sit there."

the dinner was in the best style of women's-magazine art, whereby the
salad was served in hollowed apples, and everything but the invincible

about bonds than he did. they had remembrances, and laughter over old
times. once they quarreled, and he raged that she was as "bossy" as
his wife and far more whining when he was inattentive. but that passed
safely.

their high hour was a tramp on a ringing december afternoon, through
snow-drifted meadows down to the icy chaloosa river. she was exotic
in an astrachan cap and a short beaver coat; she slid on the ice and
shouted, and he panted after her, rotund with laughter.... myra babbitt
never slid on the ice.

he was afraid that they would be seen together. in zenith it is
impossible to lunch with a neighbor's wife without the fact being
known, before nightfall, in every house in your circle. but tanis was
beautifully discreet. however appealingly she might turn to him when
they were alone, she was gravely detached when they were abroad, and he
hoped that she would be taken for a client. orville jones once saw them
emerging from a movie theater, and babbitt bumbled, "let me ma
