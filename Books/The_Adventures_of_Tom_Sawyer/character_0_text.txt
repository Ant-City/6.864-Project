preface

most of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred; one or two
were experiences of my own, the rest those of boys who were schoolmates
of mine. huck finn is drawn from life; tom sawyer also, but not from an
individual--he is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom
i knew, and therefore belongs to the composite order of architecture.

the odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children and
slaves in the west at the period of this story--that is to say, thirty or
forty years ago.

although my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and
girls, i hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account,

the house, and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur--for he was
ï¿½showing off,ï¿½ too.

there was only one thing wanting to make mr. waltersï¿½ ecstasy complete,
and that was a chance to deliver a bible-prize and exhibit a prodigy.
several pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough--he had been
around among the star pupils inquiring. he would have given worlds, now,
to have that german lad back again with a sound mind.

and now at this moment, when hope was dead, tom sawyer came forward with
nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded
a bible. this was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. walters was not
expecting an application from this source for the next ten years. but
there was no getting around it--here were the certified checks, and they
were good for their face. tom was therefore elevated to a place with
the judge and the other elect, and the great news was announced from
headquarters. it was the most stunning surprise of the decade

suppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill.
the discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame and halting, all
possibility of impressiveness being at an end; for even the gravest
sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of
unholy mirth, under cover of some remote pew-back, as if the poor parson
had said a rarely facetious thing. it was a genuine relief to the whole
congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced.

tom sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that there was
some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety
in it. he had but one marring thought; he was willing that the dog
should play with his pinchbug, but he did not think it was upright in
him to carry it off.




chapter vi

monday morning found tom sawyer miserable. monday morning always found
him so--because it began another weekï¿½s slow suffering in school. he
generally began that day with wishing he had had no

breakfast, he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his
upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable
way. he gathered quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition;
and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and
homage up to this time, now found himself suddenly without an adherent,
and shorn of his glory. his heart was heavy, and he said with a disdain
which he did not feel that it wasnï¿½t anything to spit like tom sawyer;
but another boy said, ï¿½sour grapes!ï¿½ and he wandered away a dismantled
hero.

shortly tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village, huckleberry
finn, son of the town drunkard. huckleberry was cordially hated and
dreaded by all the mothers of the town, because he was idle and lawless
and vulgar and bad--and because all their children admired him so, and
delighted in his forbidden society, and wished they dared to be like
him. tom was like the rest of the respectable boys, in that he env

irit of the storm, with his grisly flag flying
at the fore! and at the zenith of his fame, how he would suddenly appear
at the old village and stalk into church, brown and weather-beaten, in
his black velvet doublet and trunks, his great jack-boots, his crimson
sash, his belt bristling with horse-pistols, his crime-rusted cutlass
at his side, his slouch hat with waving plumes, his black flag unfurled,
with the skull and crossbones on it, and hear with swelling ecstasy
the whisperings, ï¿½itï¿½s tom sawyer the pirate!--the black avenger of the
spanish main!ï¿½

yes, it was settled; his career was determined. he would run away from
home and enter upon it. he would start the very next morning. therefore
he must now begin to get ready. he would collect his resources together.
he went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under one end of
it with his barlow knife. he soon struck wood that sounded hollow. he
put his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively:

ï¿½what hasnï¿½t come h

blood.ï¿½

tomï¿½s whole being applauded this idea. it was deep, and dark, and awful;
the hour, the circumstances, the surroundings, were in keeping with it.
he picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moon-light, took a
little fragment of ï¿½red keelï¿½ out of his pocket, got the moon on
his work, and painfully scrawled these lines, emphasizing each slow
down-stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth, and letting up the
pressure on the up-strokes. [see next page.]

ï¿½huck finn and tom sawyer swears they will keep mum about this and they
wish they may drop down dead in their tracks if they ever tell and rot.ï¿½

huckleberry was filled with admiration of tomï¿½s facility in writing, and
the sublimity of his language. he at once took a pin from his lapel and
was going to prick his flesh, but tom said:

ï¿½hold on! donï¿½t do that. a pinï¿½s brass. it might have verdigrease on
it.ï¿½

ï¿½whatï¿½s verdigrease?ï¿½

ï¿½itï¿½s pï¿½ison. thatï¿½s what it is. you just swaller some of it once

mum and wait.ï¿½

about midnight tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles,
and stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the
meeting-place. it was starlight, and very still. the mighty river lay
like an ocean at rest. tom listened a moment, but no sound disturbed the
quiet. then he gave a low, distinct whistle. it was answered from under
the bluff. tom whistled twice more; these signals were answered in the
same way. then a guarded voice said:

ï¿½who goes there?ï¿½

ï¿½tom sawyer, the black avenger of the spanish main. name your names.ï¿½

ï¿½huck finn the red-handed, and joe harper the terror of the seas.ï¿½ tom
had furnished these titles, from his favorite literature.

ï¿½ï¿½tis well. give the countersign.ï¿½

two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the
brooding night:

ï¿½_blood_!ï¿½

then tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it,
tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort. there was
an easy, comfort

s a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in life, and
many claimed that dismal distinction, and offered evidences, more or
less tampered with by the witness; and when it was ultimately decided
who _did_ see the departed last, and exchanged the last words with them,
the lucky parties took upon themselves a sort of sacred importance,
and were gaped at and envied by all the rest. one poor chap, who had
no other grandeur to offer, said with tolerably manifest pride in the
remembrance:

ï¿½well, tom sawyer he licked me once.ï¿½

but that bid for glory was a failure. most of the boys could say that,
and so that cheapened the distinction too much. the group loitered away,
still recalling memories of the lost heroes, in awed voices.

when the sunday-school hour was finished, the next morning, the bell
began to toll, instead of ringing in the usual way. it was a very still
sabbath, and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush
that lay upon nature. the villagers began to gather, loite

t ainï¿½t fair. somebodyï¿½s got to be glad to see huck.ï¿½

ï¿½and so they shall. iï¿½m glad to see him, poor motherless thing!ï¿½ and
the loving attentions aunt polly lavished upon him were the one thing
capable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before.

suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice: ï¿½praise god from
whom all blessings flow--_sing_!--and put your hearts in it!ï¿½

and they did. old hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst, and
while it shook the rafters tom sawyer the pirate looked around upon the
envying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart that this was the
proudest moment of his life.

as the ï¿½soldï¿½ congregation trooped out they said they would almost be
willing to be made ridiculous again to hear old hundred sung like that
once more.

tom got more cuffs and kisses that day--according to aunt pollyï¿½s varying
moods--than he had earned before in a year; and he hardly knew which
expressed the most gratefulness to god and affection for him

p and walked away.

alfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her, but she
said:

ï¿½go away and leave me alone, canï¿½t you! i hate you!ï¿½

so the boy halted, wondering what he could have done--for she had said
she would look at pictures all through the nooning--and she walked on,
crying. then alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse. he was
humiliated and angry. he easily guessed his way to the truth--the girl
had simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon tom sawyer.
he was far from hating tom the less when this thought occurred to him.
he wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much
risk to himself. tomï¿½s spelling-book fell under his eye. here was his
opportunity. he gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and
poured ink upon the page.

becky, glancing in at a window behind him at the moment, saw the act,
and moved on, without discovering herself. she started homeward, now,
intending to find tom and tell him; tom would b

 the case.
now, as becky was passing by the desk, which stood near the door, she
noticed that the key was in the lock! it was a precious moment. she
glanced around; found herself alone, and the next instant she had the
book in her hands. the titlepage--professor somebodyï¿½s _anatomy_--carried
no information to her mind; so she began to turn the leaves. she came at
once upon a handsomely engraved and colored frontispiece--a human figure,
stark naked. at that moment a shadow fell on the page and tom sawyer
stepped in at the door and caught a glimpse of the picture. becky
snatched at the book to close it, and had the hard luck to tear the
pictured page half down the middle. she thrust the volume into the desk,
turned the key, and burst out crying with shame and vexation.

ï¿½tom sawyer, you are just as mean as you can be, to sneak up on a person
and look at what theyï¿½re looking at.ï¿½

ï¿½how could i know you was looking at anything?ï¿½

ï¿½you ought to be ashamed of yourself, tom sawyer; you kn

 etc.--accompanying himself with the painfully exact and spasmodic
gestures which a machine might have used--supposing the machine to be a
trifle out of order. but he got through safely, though cruelly scared,
and got a fine round of applause when he made his manufactured bow and
retired.

a little shamefaced girl lisped, ï¿½mary had a little lamb,ï¿½ etc.,
performed a compassion-inspiring curtsy, got her meed of applause, and
sat down flushed and happy.

tom sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into
the unquenchable and indestructible ï¿½give me liberty or give me deathï¿½
 speech, with fine fury and frantic gesticulation, and broke down in the
middle of it. a ghastly stage-fright seized him, his legs quaked under
him and he was like to choke. true, he had the manifest sympathy of the
house but he had the houseï¿½s silence, too, which was even worse than
its sympathy. the master frowned, and this completed the disaster. tom

he took huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him. it would be some
relief to unseal his tongue for a little while; to divide his burden of
distress with another sufferer. moreover, he wanted to assure himself
that huck had remained discreet.

ï¿½huck, have you ever told anybody about--that?ï¿½

ï¿½ï¿½bout what?ï¿½

ï¿½you know what.ï¿½

ï¿½oh--ï¿½course i havenï¿½t.ï¿½

ï¿½never a word?ï¿½

ï¿½never a solitary word, so help me. what makes you ask?ï¿½

ï¿½well, i was afeard.ï¿½

ï¿½why, tom sawyer, we wouldnï¿½t be alive two days if that got found out.
_you_ know that.ï¿½

tom felt more comfortable. after a pause:

ï¿½huck, they couldnï¿½t anybody get you to tell, could they?ï¿½

ï¿½get me to tell? why, if i wanted that halfbreed devil to drownd me they
could get me to tell. they ainï¿½t no different way.ï¿½

ï¿½well, thatï¿½s all right, then. i reckon weï¿½re safe as long as we keep
mum. but letï¿½s swear again, anyway. itï¿½s more surer.ï¿½

ï¿½iï¿½m agreed.ï¿½

so they swore again wit

and led nowhere. it was said that one might wander days and nights
together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and never
find the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and down, and
still down, into the earth, and it was just the same--labyrinth under
labyrinth, and no end to any of them. no man ï¿½knewï¿½ the cave. that was
an impossible thing. most of the young men knew a portion of it, and it
was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion. tom sawyer
knew as much of the cave as any one.

the procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of
a mile, and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch
avenues, fly along the dismal corridors, and take each other by surprise
at points where the corridors joined again. parties were able to elude
each other for the space of half an hour without going beyond the
ï¿½knownï¿½ ground.

by-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the mouth
of the cave, panting, hilar

rcely fluttered the
public pulse, tremendous as the fact was. in a lucid interval, huck
feebly led up to the subject of taverns, and finally asked--dimly
dreading the worst--if anything had been discovered at the temperance
tavern since he had been ill.

ï¿½yes,ï¿½ said the widow.

huck started up in bed, wildeyed:

ï¿½what? what was it?ï¿½

ï¿½liquor!--and the place has been shut up. lie down, child--what a turn you
did give me!ï¿½

ï¿½only tell me just one thing--only just one--please! was it tom sawyer
that found it?ï¿½

the widow burst into tears. ï¿½hush, hush, child, hush! iï¿½ve told you
before, you must _not_ talk. you are very, very sick!ï¿½

then nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been a great
powwow if it had been the gold. so the treasure was gone forever--gone
forever! but what could she be crying about? curious that she should
cry.

these thoughts worked their dim way through huckï¿½s mind, and under the
weariness they gave him he fell asleep. the widow said to her

self:

ï¿½there--heï¿½s asleep, poor wreck. tom sawyer find it! pity but somebody
could find tom sawyer! ah, there ainï¿½t many left, now, thatï¿½s got hope
enough, or strength enough, either, to go on searching.ï¿½




chapter xxxi

now to return to tom and beckyï¿½s share in the picnic. they tripped along
the murky aisles with the rest of the company, visiting the familiar
wonders of the cave--wonders dubbed with rather over-descriptive names,
such as ï¿½the drawing-room,ï¿½ ï¿½the cathedral,ï¿½ ï¿½aladdinï¿½s palace,ï¿½ and
so on. presently the hide-and-seek frolicking began, and tom and becky

tom turned as white as a sheet.

ï¿½whatï¿½s the matter, boy! here, run, somebody! fetch a glass of water!ï¿½

the water was brought and thrown into tomï¿½s face.

ï¿½ah, now youï¿½re all right. what was the matter with you, tom?ï¿½

ï¿½oh, judge, injun joeï¿½s in the cave!ï¿½




chapter xxxiii

within a few minutes the news had spread, and a dozen skiff-loads of
men were on their way to mcdougalï¿½s cave, and the ferryboat, well filled
with passengers, soon followed. tom sawyer was in the skiff that bore
judge thatcher.

when the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in
the dim twilight of the place. injun joe lay stretched upon the ground,
dead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing
eyes had been fixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer
of the free world outside. tom was touched, for he knew by his own
experience how this wretch had suffered. his pity was moved, but
nevertheless he felt an abounding sens

marched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said:

ï¿½here you are! look at it, huck; itï¿½s the snuggest hole in this country.
you just keep mum about it. all along iï¿½ve been wanting to be a robber,
but i knew iï¿½d got to have a thing like this, and where to run across
it was the bother. weï¿½ve got it now, and weï¿½ll keep it quiet, only weï¿½ll
let joe harper and ben rogers in--because of course thereï¿½s got to be a
gang, or else there wouldnï¿½t be any style about it. tom sawyerï¿½s gang--it
sounds splendid, donï¿½t it, huck?ï¿½

ï¿½well, it just does, tom. and whoï¿½ll we rob?ï¿½

ï¿½oh, most anybody. waylay people--thatï¿½s mostly the way.ï¿½

ï¿½and kill them?ï¿½

ï¿½no, not always. hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom.ï¿½

ï¿½whatï¿½s a ransom?ï¿½

ï¿½money. you make them raise all they can, offï¿½n their friends; and after
youï¿½ve kept them a year, if it ainï¿½t raised then you kill them. thatï¿½s
the general way. only you donï¿½t kill the women. you sh

he disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the two small
sacks into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and started off,
dragging his cargo behind him. when the boys reached the welshmanï¿½s
house, they stopped to rest. just as they were about to move on, the
welshman stepped out and said:

ï¿½hallo, whoï¿½s that?ï¿½

ï¿½huck and tom sawyer.ï¿½

ï¿½good! come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody waiting.
here--hurry up, trot ahead--iï¿½ll haul the wagon for you. why, itï¿½s not as
light as it might be. got bricks in it?--or old metal?ï¿½

ï¿½old metal,ï¿½ said tom.

ï¿½i judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away
more time hunting up six bitsï¿½ worth of old iron to sell to the foundry
than they would to make twice the money at regular work. but thatï¿½s
human nature--hurry along, hurry along!ï

 learn his book, he had to go to church; he had to talk so
properly that speech was become insipid in his mouth; whithersoever he
turned, the bars and shackles of civilization shut him in and bound him
hand and foot.

he bravely bore his miseries three weeks, and then one day turned up
missing. for forty-eight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in
great distress. the public were profoundly concerned; they searched high
and low, they dragged the river for his body. early the third morning
tom sawyer wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheads down behind
the abandoned slaughter-house, and in one of them he found the refugee.
huck had slept there; he had just breakfasted upon some stolen odds and
ends of food, and was lying off, now, in comfort, with his pipe. he was
unkempt, uncombed, and clad in the same old ruin of rags that had made
him picturesque in the days when he was free and happy. tom routed him
out, told him the trouble he had been causing, and urged him to go home.

½t let me in, tom? didnï¿½t you let me go for a pirate?ï¿½

ï¿½yes, but thatï¿½s different. a robber is more high-toned than what a
pirate is--as a general thing. in most countries theyï¿½re awful high up in
the nobility--dukes and such.ï¿½

ï¿½now, tom, hainï¿½t you always ben friendly to me? you wouldnï¿½t shet me
out, would you, tom? you wouldnï¿½t do that, now, _would_ you, tom?ï¿½

ï¿½huck, i wouldnï¿½t want to, and i _donï¿½t_ want to--but what would people
say? why, theyï¿½d say, ï¿½mph! tom sawyerï¿½s gang! pretty low characters in
it!ï¿½ theyï¿½d mean you, huck. you wouldnï¿½t like that, and i wouldnï¿½t.ï¿½

huck was silent for some time, engaged in a mental struggle. finally he
said:

ï¿½well, iï¿½ll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if i
can come to stand it, if youï¿½ll let me bï¿½long to the gang, tom.ï¿½

ï¿½all right, huck, itï¿½s a whiz! come along, old chap, and iï¿½ll ask the
widow to let up on you a little, huck.ï¿½

ï¿½will you, tom--now will you? thatï
