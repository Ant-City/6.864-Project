taring eyes and
a way of raising and turning his head which suggested not so much caution as a
kind of ceaseless, nervous tension. his nose moved continually, and when a
bumblebee flew humming to a thistle bloom behind him, he jumped and spun
round with a start that sent two nearby rabbits scurrying for holes before the
nearest, a buck with black-tipped ears, recognized him and returned to feeding.
     "oh, it's only fiver," said the black-tipped rabbit, "jumping at bluebottles
again. come on, buckthorn, what were you telling me?"
     "fiver?" said the other rabbit. "why's he called that?"
     "five in the litter, you know: he was the last -- and the smallest. you'd wonder
nothing had got him by now. i always say a man couldn't see him and a fox
wouldn't want him. still, i admit he seems to be able to keep out of harm's way."*
     the small rabbit came closer to his companion, lolloping on long hind legs.
     "let's go a bit further, hazel," he said. "you know, there's something queer

and left it at that."
     "i don't blame you," said hazel. "knowing toadflax, i'm surprised he didn't
knock you over first and ask questions afterward. all the same, let's wait a little
longer. blackberry ought to be here soon."
     time passed. they crouched in silence while the moon shadows moved
northward in the grass. at last, just as hazel was about to run down the slope to
blackberry's burrow, he saw him come out of his hole, followed by no less than
three rabbits. one of these, buckthorn, hazel knew well. he was glad to see him,
for he knew him for a tough, sturdy fellow who was considered certain to get into
the owsla as soon as he reached full weight.
     "but i dare say he's impatient," thought hazel, "or he may have come off worst
in some scuffle over a doe and taken it hard. well, with him and bigwig, at least
we shan't be too badly off if we run into any fighting."
     he did not recognize the other two rabbits and when blackberry told him their
names -- speedwell and a

     "you're under arrest."
     "under arrest? what do you mean? what for?"
     "spreading dissension and inciting to mutiny. silver, you're under arrest too,
for failing to report to toadflax this evening and causing your duty to devolve on
a comrade. you're both to come with me."
     immediately bigwig fell upon him, scratching and kicking. holly fought back.
his followers closed in, looking for an opening to join the fight and pin bigwig
down. suddenly, from the top of the bank, buckthorn flung himself headlong into
the scuffle, knocked one of the guards flying with a kick from his back legs and
then closed with the other. he was followed a moment later by dandelion, who
landed full on the rabbit whom buckthorn had kicked. both guards broke clear,
looked round for a moment and then leaped up the bank into the wood. holly
struggled free of bigwig and crouched on his haunches, scuffling his front paws
and growling, as rabbits will when angry. he was about to speak when hazel

rs to catch the distant rustling of the beans."

     "yes, they're only just over the top. come on, let's get the others moving before
a man comes with a hrududu* or they'll scatter all over the place."
     silver roused the others and began to coax them into the field. they stumbled
out drowsily, responding with reluctance to his repeated assurance that it was
"only a little way."
     they became widely separated as they straggled up the slope. silver and bigwig
led the way, with hazel and buckthorn a short distance behind. the rest idled
along, hopping a few yards and then pausing to nibble or to pass droppings on the
warm, sunny grass. silver was almost at the crest when suddenly, from halfway
up, there came a high screaming -- the sound a rabbit makes, not to call for help
or to frighten an enemy, but simply out of terror. fiver and pipkin, limping
behind the others, and conspicuously undersized and tired, were being attacked
by the crow. it had flown low along the ground. then, pouncin

to follow him. hazel remembered that fiver
had said he thought he was injured. now, as he watched him limping and
staggering up the slope, it occurred to him that he might actually be wounded in
some way. he kept trying to put his near-side front paw to the ground and then
drawing it up again, hopping on three legs.

     "i'll have a look at him as soon as they're settled under cover," he thought.
"poor little chap, he won't be able to get much further like that."
     at the top of the slope buckthorn was already leading the way into the
beanfield. hazel reached the hedge, crossed a narrow turf verge on the other side
and found himself looking straight down a long, shadowy aisle between two rows
of beans. the earth was soft and crumbling, with a scattering of the weeds that
are found in cultivated fields -- fumitory, charlock, pimpernel and mayweed, all
growing in the green gloom under the bean leaves. as the plants moved in the
breeze, the sunlight dappled and speckled back and forth over t

he brown soil, the
white pebbles and weeds. yet in this ubiquitous restlessness there was nothing
alarming, for the whole forest took part in it and the only sound was the soft,
steady movement of the leaves. far along the bean row hazel glimpsed
buckthorn's back and followed him into the depths of the field.
     soon after, all the rabbits had come together in a kind of hollow. far around,
on all sides, stood the orderly rows of beans, securing them against hostile
approach, roofing them over and covering their scent. they could hardly have
been safer underground. even a little food could be had at a pinch, for here and
there were a few pale twists of grass and here and there a dandelion.
     "we can sleep here all day," said hazel. "but i sup

came soaked

with the dew. the ground was broken by rifts and pits of naked black peat, where
water lay and sharp white stones, some as big as a pigeon's, some as a rabbit's
skull, glimmered in the moonlight. whenever they reached one of these rifts the
rabbits huddled together, waiting for hazel or bigwig to climb the further side
and find a way forward. everywhere they came upon beetles, spiders and small
lizards which scurried away as they pushed through the fibrous, resistant heather.
once buckthorn disturbed a snake, and leaped into the air as it whipped between
his paws to vanish down a hole at the foot of a birch.
     the very plants were unknown to them -- pink lousewort with its sprays of
hooked flowers, bog asphodel and the thin-stemmed blooms of the sundews,
rising above their hairy, fly-catching mouths, all shut fast by night. in this close
jungle all was silence. they went more and more slowly, and made long halts in
the peat cuts. but if the heather itself was silent, the breeze

makes them. i want them to go on because they can see it's the only thing to do.
there are too few of us for giving orders and biting people. frith in a fog! isn't
there enough trouble and danger already?"
     they went over to the far end of the pit. bigwig and silver were talking with
buckthorn under an overhanging broom. nearby, pipkin and dandelion were
pretending to feed on a patch of scrub. some way away, acorn was making a great

business of licking hawkbit's throat, while speedwell watched.
     "keep still if you can, poor old chap," said acorn, who obviously wanted to be
overheard. "just let me clean the blood out. steady, now!" hawkbit winced in an
exaggerated manner and backed away. as hazel came up, all the rabbits turned
and stared at him expectantly.
     "look," said ha

om his fur. he could see fiver's hills plainly now, greenish-gray
and seeming close in the rain-laden air. he could even pick out the dots of furze
bushes and stunted yew trees on the steep slopes. as he gazed at them, he heard
an excited voice further down the track.
     "he's done it! didn't i tell you he'd do it?"
     hazel turned his head and saw blackberry on the path. he was bedraggled and
exhausted, but it was he who was speaking. out of the heather behind him came
acorn, speedwell and buckthorn. all four rabbits were now staring straight at
him. he wondered why. then, as they approached, he realized that they were
looking not at him, but past him at something further off. he turned round. the
gravel track led downhill into a narrow belt of silver birch and rowan. beyond was
a thin hedge; and beyond that, a green field between two copses. they had
reached the other side of the common.
     "oh, hazel," said blackberry, coming up to him round a puddle in the gravel. "i

confused, i actually began to wonder whether you knew where
you were going. i could hear you in the heather, saying 'not far now' and it was
annoying me. i thought you were making it up. i should have known better.
frithrah, you're what i call a chief rabbit!"
     "well done, hazel!" said buckthorn. "well done!"
     hazel did not know what to reply. he looked at them in silence and it was
acorn who spoke next.
     "come on!" he said. "who's going to be first into that field? i can still run." he
was off, slowly enough, down the slope, but when hazel stamped for him to stop
he did so at once.
     "where are the others?" said hazel. "dandelion? bigwig?"
     at that moment dandelion appeared out of the heather and sat on the path,
looking at the field. he was followed first by hawkbit an

was watching fiver as he took in the sight of the field, when buckthorn drew his
attention back to the foot of the slope.
     "look, hazel," he said, "silver and bigwig are down there. they're waiting for
us."
     silver's light-gray fur showed up plainly against a low spray of gorse, but hazel
could not see bigwig until he sat up and ran toward them.
     "splendid, hazel," he said. "everybody's here. let's get them into that field."
     a few moments later they were under the silver birches and as the sun rose,

need to do any serious digging, is there?" said bigwig. "that
sort of thing's all right for does, but not for us."
     "still, we'd better make one or two scrapes, don't you think?" said hazel.
"something to give us shelter at a pinch. let's go up to the copse and look round.
we might as well take our time and make quite sure where we'd like to have
them. we don't want to have to do the work twice."

     "yes, that's the style," said bigwig. "and while you're doing that, i'll take silver
and buckthorn here and have a run down the fields beyond, just to get the lie of
the land and make sure there isn't anything dangerous."
     the three explorers set off beside the brook, while hazel led the other rabbits
across the field and up to the edge of the woodland. they went slowly along the
foot of the bank, pushing in and out of the clumps of red campion and ragged
robin. from time to time one or another would begin to scrape in the gravelly
bank, or venture a little way in among the trees and nut

 he said,
     "blackberry?"
     "he's down the hole," replied pipkin.
     "go and get him."
     still the strange rabbit made no move. the wind rose and the long grass began
to flutter and ripple in the dip between them. from behind, blackberry said,
     "you wanted me, hazel?"
     "i'm going over to speak to that rabbit," said hazel. "i want you to come with
me."
     "can i come?" asked pipkin.
     "no, hlao-roo. we don't want to frighten him. three's too many."
     "be careful," said buckthorn, as hazel and blackberry set off down the slope.
"he may not be the only one."
     at several points the brook was narrow -- not much wider than a rabbit run.
they jumped it and went up the opposite slope.
     "just behave as if we were back at home," said hazel. "i don't see how it can be
a trap, and anyway we can always run."
     as they approached, the other rabbit kept still and watched them intently.
they could see now that he was a big fellow, sleek and handsome. his fur shone

     he ran down the slope and over the brook. they watched him leap the bank of
the further copse and disappear through the green bracken. the first scatters of
rain were beginning to fall, pattering into the oak leaves and pricking the bare
pink skin inside their ears.
     "fine, big fellow, isn't he?" said buckthorn. "he doesn't look as though he had
much to bother about, living here."
     "what should we do, hazel, do you think?" asked silver. "it's true what he said,
isn't it? these scrapes -- well, we can crouch in them out of the weather, but no
more than that. and as we can't all get into one, we shall have to split up."
     "we'll join them together," said hazel, "and while we're doing that i'd like to
talk about what he said. fiver, bigwig and blackberry, can you come with me?

 bigwig had at least shown which
way any sound-hearted rabbit would be likely to lean. apparently the only
contribution fiver could make was this beetle-spirited vaporing. he tried to
remember that fiver was undersized and that they had had an anxious time and
were all weary. at this moment the soil at the far end of the burrow began to
crumble inward, then it fell away and silver's head and front paws appeared.
     "here we are," said silver cheerfully. "we've done what you wanted, hazel, and
buckthorn's through next door. but what i'd like to know is, how about what's-
his-name? cowpat -- no -- cowslip? are we going to his warren or not? surely
we're not going to sit cowering in this place because we're frightened to go and
see him. whatever will he think of us?"
     "i'll tell you," said dandelion, from over his shoulder. "if he's not honest, he'll
know we're afraid to come; and if he is, he'll think we're suspicious, cowardly
skulkers. if we're going to live in these fields, we'll have to

way into the field before stopping to wait for the rest. buckthorn, perhaps the
most sensible and staunch of them all. pipkin, who looked round for hazel and
then came over to wait beside him. acorn, hawkbit and speedwell, decent
enough rank-and-filers as long as they were not pushed beyond their limits. last
of all came fiver, dejected and reluctant as a sparrow in the frost. as hazel turned
from the hole, the clouds in the west broke slightly and there was a sudden dazzle
of watery, pale gold light.
     "o el-ahrairah!" thought hazel. "these are rabbits we'

 can no longer be in doubt -- so this gathering of rabbits
in the dark, beginning with hesitant approaches, silences, pauses, movements,
crouchings side by side and all manner of tentative appraisals, slowly moved, like
a hemisphere of the world into summer, to a warmer, brighter region of mutual
liking and approval, until all felt sure that they had nothing to fear. pipkin, some
way away from hazel, crouched at his ease between two huge rabbits who could
have broken his back in a second, while buckthorn and cowslip started a playful
scuffle, nipping each other like kittens and then breaking off to comb their ears in
a comical pretense of sudden gravity. only fiver sat alone and apart. he seemed
either ill or very much depressed, and the strangers avoided him instinctively.
     the knowledge that the gathering was safely round the corner came to hazel in
the form of a recollection of silver's head and paws breaking through gravel. at
once, he felt warm and relaxed. he had already crossed the w

they've been a nuisance for several days now. i must get someone to try to keep
them off until we've finished carrying. but they're really too big for a rabbit to
tackle. now, sparrows--"
     "what's that got to do with fiver?" asked hazel sharply.
     "in fact," said cowslip, breaking into a run, "i'll go myself."
     but he did not engage the jackdaws and hazel saw him pick up another carrot
and start back with it. annoyed, he joined buckthorn and dandelion and the
three of them returned together. as they came up to the warren bank he suddenly
caught sight of fiver. he was sitting half concealed under the low spread of a yew
tree on the edge of the copse, some way from the holes of the warren. putting
down his carrot, hazel ran across, scrambled up the bank and joined him on the

bare ground under the low, close boughs. fiver said nothing and continued to
stare over the field.

we're all wondering what kind of things you tell stories about."
     "well, we don't tell the old stories very much," said cowslip. "our stories and
poems are mostly about our own lives here. of course, that shape of laburnum
that you saw -- that's old-fashioned now. el-ahrairah doesn't really mean much to
us. not that your friend's story wasn't very charming," he added hastily.
     "el-ahrairah is a trickster," said buckthorn, "and rabbits will always need
tricks."
     "no," said a new voice from the further end of the hall, beyond cowslip.
"rabbits need dignity and, above all, the will to accept their fate."
     "we think silverweed is one of the best poets we've had for many months,"
said cowslip. "his ideas have a great following. would you like to hear him now?"
     "yes, yes," said voices from all sides. "silverweed!"

spoke and hazel was beside him in a flash.
     "this is it," said blackberry. "the wire's on a peg and the peg's in the ground --
there, look. we've got to dig it out. come on -- dig beside it."
     hazel dug once more, his forepaws throwing up the soft, wet soil and slipping
against the hard sides of the peg. dimly, he was aware of the others waiting
nearby. after a time he was forced to stop, panting. silver took his place, and was
followed by buckthorn. the nasty, smooth, clean, man-smelling peg was laid bare
to the length of a rabbit's ear, but still it did not come loose. bigwig had not
moved. he lay across the wire, torn and bloody, with closed eyes. buckthorn drew
his head and paws out of the hole and rubbed the mud off his face.
     "the peg's narrower down there," he said. "it tapers. i think it could be bitten
through, but i can't get my teeth to it."

     "only one?" said bigwig. "what a pity! you take him, silver. i won't deprive
you. make a good job of it while you're at it."
     they stopped and waited, dotted here and there about the slope. the rabbit
who was coming was running in a curious, headlong manner. once he ran
straight into a thick-stemmed thistle, knocking himself sideways and rolling over
and over. but he got up and came blundering on toward them.
     "is it the white blindness?" said buckthorn. "he's not looking where he's
going."
     "frith forbid!" said blackberry. "shall we run away?"
     "no, he couldn't run like that with the white blindness," said hazel. "whatever
ails him, it isn't that."
     "it's strawberry!" cried dandelion.
     strawberry came through the hedge by the crab-apple tree, looked about him
and made his way to hazel. all his urbane self-possession had vanished. he was
staring and trembling and his great size seemed only to add to his air of stricken
misery.

.
     at the foot of the turf cliff, hazel and his companions were crouching under
the low branches of two or three spindle trees. since the previous morning they
had journeyed nearly three miles. their luck had been good, for everyone who
had left the warren was still alive. they had splashed through two brooks and
wandered fearfully in the deep woodlands west of ecchinswell. they had rested in
the straw of a starveall, or lonely barn, and woken to find themselves attacked by
rats. silver and buckthorn, with bigwig helping them, had covered the retreat
until, once all were together outside, they had taken to flight. buckthorn had been
bitten in the foreleg, and the wound, in the manner of a rat bite, was irritant and
painful. skirting a small lake, they had stared to see a great gray fisher bird that
stabbed and paddled in the sedge, until a flight of wild duck had frightened them
away with their clamor. they had crossed more than half a mile of open pasture
without a trace of cover, expectin

t the warren had been a grim shock. they had
come closer together, relying on and valuing each other's capacities. they knew
now that it was on these and on nothing else that their lives depended, and they
were not going to waste anything they possessed between them. in spite of
hazel's efforts beside the snare, there was not one of them who had not turned
sick at heart to think that bigwig was dead and wondered, like blackberry, what
would become of them now. without hazel, without blackberry, buckthorn and
pipkin -- bigwig would have died. without himself he would have died, for which
else, of them all, would not have stopped running after such punishment? there
was no more questioning of bigwig's strength, fiver's insight, blackberry's wits or
hazel's authority. when the rats came, buckthorn and silver had obeyed bigwig
and stood their ground. the rest had followed hazel when he roused them and,
without explanation, told them to go quickly outside the barn. later, hazel had
said that there w

darned well ought
to be," replied bigwig, "the great dandy" -- for by their standards strawberry was
scrupulously clean and fastidious. "well, i won't have him brow-beaten, bigwig,
mind. that won't help him." this bigwig had accepted, though rather sulkily. yet
he himself had become less overbearing. the snare had left him weak and
overwrought. it was he who had given the alarm in the barn, for he could not
sleep and at the sound of scratching had started up at once. he would not let
silver and buckthorn fight alone, but he had felt obliged to leave the worst of it to
them. for the first time in his life, bigwig had found himself driven to moderation
and prudence.
     as the sun sank lower and touched the edge of the cloud belt on the horizon,
hazel came out from under the branches and looked carefully round the lower
slope. then he stared upward over the anthills, to the open down rising above.

 they are in proved, familiar surroundings close
to their holes, live in continual fear. if it grows intense enough they can become
glazed and paralyzed by it -- "tharn," to use their own word. hazel and his
companions had been on the jump for nearly two days. indeed, ever since they
had left their home warren, five days before, they had faced one danger after
another. they were all on edge, sometimes starting at nothing and, again, lying
down in any patch of long grass that offered. bigwig and buckthorn smelled of
blood and everyone else knew they did. what bothered hazel, dandelion and
hawkbit was the openness and strangeness of the down and their inability to see
very far ahead. they climbed not over but through the sun-red grass, among the
awakened insect movement and the light ablaze. the grass undulated about
them. they peered over anthills and looked cautiously round clumps of teazle.
they could not tell how far away the ridge might be. they topped each short slope

urrows scooped out of the top of the chalk subsoil. rabbits do
not line their sleeping places and a hard, almost rocky floor is uncomfortable for
those not accustomed to it. the holes in the bank, however, had runs of the usual
bow shape, leading down to the chalk and then curving up again to burrows with
floors of trampled earth. there were no connecting passages, but the rabbits were

too weary to care. they slept four to a burrow, snug and secure. hazel remained
awake for some time, licking buckthorn's leg, which was stiff and tender. he was
reassured to find no smell of infection, but all that he had ever heard about rats
decided him to see that buckthorn got a good deal of rest and was kept out of the
dirt until the wound was better. "that's the third one of us to get hurt: still, all in
all, things could have been far worse," he thought, as he fell asleep.

audible a long way off. people who record birdsong generally do it very early --
before six o'clock -- if they can. soon after that, the invasion of distant noise in
most woodland becomes too constant and too loud. during the last fifty years the
silence of much of the country has been destroyed. but here, on watership down,
there floated up only faint traces of the daylight noise below.
     the sun was well up, though not yet as high as the down, when hazel woke.
with him in the burrow were buckthorn, fiver and pipkin. he was nearest to the
mouth of the hole and did not wake them as he slipped up the run. outside, he
stopped to pass hraka and then hopped through the thorn patch to the open
grass. below, the country was covered with early-morning mist which was
beginning to clear. here and there, far off, were the shapes of trees and roofs,
from which streamers of mist trailed down like broken waves pouring from rocks.
the sky was cloudless and deep blue, darkening to mauve along the whole r

 bigger than a rat, they will
sometimes attack young rabbits. no doubt this is why most grown rabbits will not
remain under a hovering kestrel. before long, acorn spotted one as it flew up
from the south. he stamped and bolted into the trees, followed by the other
rabbits who were in the open. they had not long come out and resumed digging
when they saw another -- or perhaps the same one -- hovering some way off, high
over the very fields that they had crossed the previous morning. hazel placed
buckthorn as a sentry while the day's haphazard work went on, and twice more
during the afternoon the alarm was given. in the early evening they were
disturbed by a horseman cantering along the ridge track that passed the north
end of the wood. otherwise they saw nothing larger than a pigeon all day.
     after the horseman had turned south near the summit of watership and
disappeared in the distance, hazel returned to the edge of the wood and looked
out northward toward the bright, still fields and the

myself and so will you if you've got any sense."
     but before he went, bigwig turned to hazel and said, "you got yourself out of
that ditch down there instead of me, didn't you, hazel? i shan't forget that."

holly would never leave the threarah."

wait until tomorow. holly may stop running, but i don't think bluebell will. now
let me alone to do this leg of buckthorn's."

     "everyone was underground, just chewing pellets or sleeping. i'd gone up for a
few minutes to pass hraka. i was on the edge of the wood, quite near the ditch,
when i saw some men come through the gate at the top of the opposite slope, up
by that board thing. i don't know how many there were -- three or four, i
suppose. they had long black legs and they were burning white sticks in their
mouths. they didn't seem to be going anywhere. they began walking slowly

     even before holly had finished his story, hazel had fallen to sniffing at his

wounded ear. he had not previously been able to get a good look at it, but now
that he did, he realized that terror and fatigue had probably not been the
principal causes of holly's collapse. he was badly wounded -- worse than
buckthorn. he must have lost a lot of blood. his ear was in ribbons and there was
any amount of dirt in it. hazel felt annoyed with dandelion. as several of the
rabbits began to silflay, attracted by the mild june night and the full moon, he
asked blackberry to wait. silver, who had been about to leave by the other run,
returned and joined them.
     "dandelion and the other two seem to have cheered you up, all right," said
hazel to holly. "it's a pity they didn't clean you up as well. that dirt's danger

you, we'd have found the place ourselves sooner or later, but not as soon as this."
     hazel could have pressed his chin glands for satisfaction, but he replied
merely, "we shan't need to go down the hill so much, after all." then he added,
"but, holly, you smell of blood, you know. it may be dangerous, even here. let's
go back to the wood. it's such a beautiful night that we can sit near the holes to
chew pellets and bluebell can tell us his story."
     they found strawberry and buckthorn on the bank; and when everyone was
comfortably chewing, with ears laid flat, bluebell began.

     "dandelion was telling me last night about cowslip's warren and how he told
the story of the king's lettuce. that's what put me in mind of this tale, even
before hazel explained his idea. i used to hear it from my grandfather and he
always said that it happened after el-ahrairah had got his people out of the
marshes of kelfazin. they went to the meadows of fenlo and there they dug

then it opened its wings high above its body and hazel jumped back, startled by
the great, arching span. but at once it closed them again, grimacing with pain.
     "ving no good. i come."
     it followed hazel docilely enough across the grass, but he was careful to keep
out of its reach. their arrival outside the wood caused something of a sensation,
which hazel cut short with a peremptory sharpness quite unlike his usual
manner.
     "come on, get busy," he said to dandelion and buckthorn. "this bird's hurt
and we're going to shelter it until it's better. ask bigwig to show you how to get it
some food. it eats worms and insects. try grasshoppers, spiders -- anything.
hawkbit! acorn! yes, and you too, fiver -- come out of that rapt trance, or
whatever you're in. we need an open, wide hole, broader than it's deep, with a flat
floor a little below the level of the entrance: by nightfall."

h rabbit in turn, discussing who would
be the most likely to survive the long journey, to arrive in good shape and to go
down well in a strange warren. bigwig, rejected on the grounds that he might
quarrel in strange company, was inclined to be sulky at first, but came round
when he remembered that he could go on looking after kehaar. holly himself
wanted to take bluebell but, as blackberry said, one funny joke at the expense of
the chief rabbit might ruin everything. finally they chose silver, buckthorn and
strawberry. strawberry said little, but was obviously very much pleased. he had
suffered a good deal to show that he was no coward and now he had the

satisfaction of knowing that he was worth something to his new friends.
     they started early in the morning, in the gray light. kehaar had undertaken to
fly out later in the day, to make sure they were going in the right direction and
bring back news of their progress. hazel and bigwig went with them to the
southern end of the hanger and

     it was a dismal welcome for the strangers. not even bluebell could find a
cheerful word. dandelion was inconsolable to think that he might have stopped
hazel breaking from the ditch. the meeting came to an end in a dreary silence
and a half-hearted silflay.
     later that morning holly came limping into the warren. of his three
companions, only silver was alert and unharmed. buckthorn was wounded in the
face and strawberry was shivering and evidently ill from exhaustion. there were
no other rabbits with them.

ow?" should he ask kehaar to go and
look for them while there was still light? but if kehaar found them, what then?
they could not be compelled to return. or if they were, what good would that do,
if they wanted to be gone? at that moment holly began to speak and everyone
became quiet.
     "we all know we're in a mess," said holly, "and i suppose before long we shall
have to talk about what's best to be done. but i thought that first of all i ought to
tell you how it is that we four -- silver, buckthorn, strawberry and i -- have come
back without any does. you don't have to remind me that when we set out,
everyone thought it was going to be straightforward. and here we are, one rabbit
sick, one wounded and nothing to show for it. you're all wondering why."
     "no one's blaming you, holly," said bigwig.
     "i don't know whether i'm to blame or not," replied holly. "but you'll tell me
that when you've heard the story.

other two and said, 'stay here, and look alive, too. i'm going round the sentries.'
     "well, then the four of us ran off into the dark and, sure enough, after we'd
gone a little way two sentries popped up and tried to stop us. we all piled straight
into them. i thought they'd run, but they didn't. they fought like mad and one of
them tore buckthorn all down the nose. but of course there were four of us; and
in the end we broke past them and simply tore across the field. we had no idea
which way we were going, what with the rain and the night: we just ran. i think
the reason why the pursuit was a bit slow off the mark was because poor old
bugloss wasn't there to give the orders. anyway, we had a fair start. but presently
we could hear that we were being followed -- and, what was worse, we were being
overtaken.
     "the efrafan owsla are n

     holly stopped and fell silent, as though pondering on what he remembered. at
last he said,
     "it's going to be very hard to describe to you what happened next. although all
four of us were there, we don't understand it ourselves. but what i'm going to say
now is the cold truth. lord frith sent one of his great messengers to save us from
the efrafan owsla. each one of us had fallen over the edge of the bank in one
place or another. buckthorn, who was half blinded with his own blood, went
down almost to the bottom. i'd picked myself up and was looking back at the top.
there was just enough light in the sky to see the efrafans if they came over. and
then -- then an enormous thing -- i can't give you any idea of it -- as big as a

and smoke and light and it roared and beat on the metal lines until the ground

except silver: i don't know what we'd have done without him. we went on for a
day and a night without any real rest at all. we all felt that the only thing we
wanted to do was to get back here as soon as we could. when i reached the wood
this morning i was just limping along in a bad dream. i'm not really much better
than poor old strawberry, i'm afraid. he never complained, but he'll need a long

rest and i rather think i shall, too. and buckthorn -- that's the second bad wound
he's had. but that's not the worst now, is it? we've lost hazel: the worst thing that
could have happened. some of you asked me earlier this evening if i would be
chief rabbit. i'm glad to know you trust me, but i'm completely done in and i
can't possibly take it on yet. i feel as dry and empty as an autumn puffball -- i feel

kind, are usually full of questions, but the rabbits expressed
their delight simply by proving to themselves through their senses that this was
really hazel-rah. it was all he could do to stand up to the rough play. "i wonder
what would happen if i lay down under it?" he thought. "they'd kick me out, i
dare say. they wouldn't have a crippled chief rabbit. this is a test as well as a
welcome, even though they don't know it themselves. i'll test them, the rascals,
before i'm done."
     he pushed buckthorn and speedwell off his back and broke away to the edge
of the wood. strawberry and boxwood were on the bank and he joined them and
sat washing and combing himself in the sunrise.
     "we can do with a few well-behaved fellows like you," he said to boxwood.
"look at that rough lot out there -- they nearly finished me off! what on earth do
you make of us and how are you settling down?"
     "well, of course we find it strange," said boxwood, "but we're learning.

     bigwig came up the run, put his head out of the hole and stopped in horror.

it die under a stone?"
     "you like, meester pigvig? i pring you nice liddle pit, ya?"
     "bigwig," said hazel, "go and tell all the others that we're setting off at
daybreak tomorrow. holly will be chief rabbit here until we get back and
buckthorn, strawberry and the farm rabbits are to stay with him. anyone else
who wants to stay will be perfectly free to do so."
     "don't worry," said bigwig, from the hole. "i'll send them all up to silflay with

gs to set in his favor. he knew that they were afraid, for he was afraid himself.
indeed, he guessed that they, like himself, could not be free from the thought of
efrafa and its grim owsla. but working against this fear was their longing and
need to find more does and the knowledge that there were plenty of does in
efrafa. then there was their sense of mischief. all rabbits love to trespass and
steal and when it comes to the point very few will admit that they are afraid to do
so; unless (like buckthorn or strawberry on this occasion) they know that they
are not fit and that their bodies may let them down in the pinch. again, in
speaking about his secret plan, hazel had aroused their curiosity. he had hoped
that, with fiver behind him, he could lure them with hints and promises: and he
had been right. the rabbits trusted him and fiver, who had gotten them out of
sandleford before it was too late, crossed the enborne and the common, taken

everything in this river goes along, and fast, too -- see there." he looked out at a
piece of stick floating down on the even two-mile-an-hour current. "so what's
stopping this thing from going?"
     kehaar had a short-way-with-landlubbers manner which he sometimes used to
those of the rabbits that he did not particularly like. blackberry was not one of his

favorites: he preferred straightforward characters such as bigwig, buckthorn and
silver.

     "yes, i see," said fiver. "the rope goes round that metal thing where hazel's

you could gnaw it through and the leaf -- the boat -- would drop off the bank."
     "well, anyway, let's go back now," said hazel, rather dejectedly. "i'm afraid we
don't seem to be any nearer to finding what we're looking for, kehaar. can you

 before he came racing back.
     "hazel-rah, i've been quite close to that wood you spoke of," he said, "and
there are two rabbits playing about on a patch of short grass just outside it."
     "i'll come and see," said hazel. "dandelion, you come, too, will you?"
     as they ran down the hill to the right of the track, hazel fairly skipped to
recognize the beech hanger. he noticed one or two yellow leaves and a faint touch
of bronze here and there in the green boughs. then he caught sight of buckthorn

and strawberry running toward them across the grass.
     "hazel-rah!" cried buckthorn. "dandelion! what happened? where are the
others? did you get any does? is everyone all right?"
     "they'll be here very soon," said hazel. "yes, we've got a lot of does and
everyone who went has come back. this is blackavar, who's come out of efrafa."
     "good for him," said strawberry. "oh, hazel-rah, we've watched at the end of
the wood every evening since you went. holly and boxwood are all right --

long the bank, while vervain went into the wood, where the mouths of the holes
lay between the tree roots. he came at once upon the open run. he listened, but
all was quiet. vervain (who was more used to dealing with prisoners than with
enemies) ordered two of his rabbits to make their way down it. the discovery of
the silent, open run gave him the hope that he might be able to seize the warren
by a sudden dash to the very center. the wretched rabbits, obeying his orders,
were met by silver and buckthorn at a point where the run opened out. they were
cuffed and mauled and barely got out with their lives. the sight of them did
nothing to encourage vervain's party, who were reluctant to dig and made little
headway during the darkness before moonrise.
     groundsel, who felt that he ought to set an example, himself dug his way into
the loose, fallen soil of one of the bank runs. plowing over the soft earth like a fly
on summer butter and holding his head clear, he suddenly found himself face to

high. seeing him
in good heart, the others set aside their fear as best they could and did as he told
them, enlarging the burrows beyond the south end of the honeycomb and piling
up the soft earth in the entry runs until what had been a colonnade began to
become a solid wall. it was during a pause in this work that speedwell reported
that the digging above the north end had stopped. hazel went and crouched
beside him, listening for some time. there was nothing to be heard. he went back
to where buckthorn sat guarding the foot of the single open run -- kehaar's run,
as it was called.
     "you know what's happened?" he said. "they've realized they're all among the
beech roots up there, so they've chucked it. they'll be going harder at the other
end now."
     "i suppose so, hazel-rah," replied buckthorn. after a little he said, "d'you
remember the rats in the barn? we got out of that all right, didn't we? but i'm
afraid we shan't get out of this. it's a pity, after all we've done together."

 "yes, we shall," said hazel, with all the conviction he could muster. but he
knew that if he stayed he would not be able to keep up the pretense. buckthorn --
a decent, straightforward fellow if ever there was one -- where would he be by ni-
frith tomorrow? and he himself -- where had he led them, with all his clever
schemes? had they come over the common, among the shining wires, through the
thunderstorm, the culverts on the great river, to die at the claws of general
woundwort? it was not the death they deserved; it was not the right end of the
clever track they had run. but what could stop woundwort? what could save
them now? nothing, he knew -

- unless some tremendous blow were to fall upon
the efrafans from outside: and of that there was no chance. he turned away from
buckthorn.

     scratch, scratch: scratch, scratch came the sound of the digging above.
crossing the floor in the dark, hazel found himself beside another rabbit, who
was crouching silently on the near side of the new-piled wall. he stopped,
sniffing. it was fiver.
     "aren't you working?" he asked listlessly.
     "no," replied fiver. "i'm listening."

     "no, not the digging. there's something i'm trying to hear -- something the
others can't hear. only i can't hear

the wood."
     the wind blew, the trees shook their myriads of leaves. the stream was gone.
he was in the honeycomb, facing bigwig in the dark, across the motionless body
of fiver. the scratching from above was louder and closer.
     "bigwig," said hazel, "do as i say at once, there's a good fellow. we've got
hardly any time. go and get dandelion and blackberry and bring them to me at
the foot of kehaar's run, quickly."
     at the foot of the run buckthorn was still in his place. he had not moved at
fiver's cry, but his breath was short and his pulse very quick. he and the other
three rabbits gathered about hazel without a word.
     "i've got a plan," said hazel. "if it works, it'll finish woundwort for good and
all. but i've no time to explain. every moment counts now. dandelion and

blackberry, you come with me. you're to go straight up out of this run and

 on a sunny
evening by the beech trees, he could not clearly recall whether they were about
himself or about some other rabbit hero of days gone by.
     the warren prospered and so, in the fullness of time, did the new warren on
the belt, half watership and half efrafan -- the warren that hazel had first
envisaged on that terrible evening when he set out alone to face general
woundwort and try to save his friends against all odds. groundsel was the first
chief rabbit; but he had strawberry and buckthorn to give him advice and he had
learned better than to mark anyone or to order more than a very occasional wide
patrol. campion readily agreed to send some rabbits from efrafa and the first
party was led by none other than captain avens, who acted sensibly and made a
very good job of it.
     general woundwort was never seen again. but it was certainly true, as
groundsel said, that no one ever found his body, so it may perhaps be that, after
all, that extraordinary rabbit really did wander away t
