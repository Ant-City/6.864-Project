[CHARACTER]

simon [CHARACTER] is one of the most sympathetic characters
in the entire new testament. [CHARACTER] is determined to be jesus's best
disciple, but prematurely thinks he understands what it means to
follow jesus. [CHARACTER] does not believe jesus's prediction that he will
deny having known jesus, but [CHARACTER]'s eagerness is immature, and
he does end up denying his friendship to jesus during the terrifying
series of events surrounding the trial and crucifixion. [CHARACTER] realizes
his mistake and weeps bitterly. he is forgiven, and remains the
rock upon which jesus says he will build his church. [CHARACTER] is a
model of faithful discipleship. to this day, the catholic church
claims apostolic succession from this very [CHARACTER], whose faith was
as solid as a rock, but who was also at times overeager, afraid,
and all too human.
