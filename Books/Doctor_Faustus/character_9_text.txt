y through the world and air,
     they put forth questions of astrology,
     which faustus answer'd with such learned skill
     as they admir'd and wonder'd at his wit.
     now is his fame spread forth in every land:
     amongst the rest the emperor is one,
     carolus the fifth, at whose palace now
     faustus is feasted 'mongst his noblemen.
     what there he did, in trial of his art,
     i leave untold; your eyes shall see['t] perform'd.

     robin. o, this is admirable! here i ha' stolen one of doctor
     faustus' conjuring-books, and, i'faith, i mean to search some
     circles for my own use.  now will i make all the maidens in our
     parish dance at my pleasure, stark naked, before me; and so
     by that means i shall see more than e'er i felt or saw yet.

     she has sent me to look thee out; prithee, come away.

     robin. keep out, keep out, or else you are blown up, you are
     dismembered, ralph:  keep out, for i am about a roaring piece
     of work.

     ralph. come, what doest thou with that same book? thou canst
     not read?

     robin. yes, my master and mistress shall find that i can read,
     he for his forehead, she for her private study; she's born to
     bear with me, or else my art fails.

     ralph. why, robin, what book is that?

     robin. what book! why, the most intolerable book for conjuring
     that e'er was invented by any brimstone devil.

     ralph. canst thou conjure with it?

     robin. i can do all these things easily with it; first, i can

     ralph. our master parson says that's nothing.

     robin. true, ralph:  and more, ralph, if thou hast any mind to
     nan spit, our kitchen-maid, then turn her and wind her to thy own
     use, as often as thou wilt, and at midnight.

     ralph. o, brave, robin! shall i have nan spit, and to mine own
     use?  on that condition i'll feed thy devil with horse-bread as
     long as he lives, of free cost.

     robin. no more, sweet ralph:  let's go and make clean our boots,
     which lie foul upon our hands, and then to our conjuring in the
     devil's name.
