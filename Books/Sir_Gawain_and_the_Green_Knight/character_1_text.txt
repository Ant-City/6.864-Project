urse was announced with cracking of trumpets, with the
    noise of nakers and noble pipes.

      "each two had dishes twelve,
      good beer and bright wine both."

    scarcely was the first course served when another noise than that of
    music was heard. there rushes in at the hall-door a knight of gigantic
    stature--the greatest on earth--in measure high. he was clothed
    entirely in green, and rode upon a green foal (ll. 116-178). fair wavy
    hair fell about the shoulders of the green knight, and a great beard
    like a bush hung upon his breast (ll. 179-202).

    the knight carried no helmet, shield, or spear, but in one hand a holly
    bough, and in the other an axe "huge and unmeet," the edge of which was
    as keen as a sharp razor (ll. 203-220). thus arrayed, the green knight
    enters the hall without saluting any one. the first word that he
    uttered was, "where is the govenour of this gang? gladly would i see
    him and with himself speak reason." to the knights he

cast his eye,
    looking for the most renowned. much did the noble assembly marvel to
    see a man and a horse of such a hue, green as the grass. even greener
    they seemed than green enamel on bright gold. many marvels had they
    seen, but none such as this. they were afraid to answer, but sat
    stone-still in a dead silence, as if overpowered by sleep;

      "not all from fear, but some for courtesy" (ll. 221-249).

    then arthur before the high daïs salutes the green knight, bids him
    welcome, and entreats him to stay awhile at his court. the knight says
    that his errand is not to abide in any dwelling, but to seek the most
    valiant of the heroes of the round table that he may put his courage to
    the proof, and thus satisfy himself as to the fame of arthur's court.
    "i come," he says, "in peace, as ye may see by this branch that i bear
    here. had i come with hostile intentions, i should not have left my
    hauberk, helmet, shield, sharp spear, a

nd other weapons behind me. but
    because i desire no war, 'my weeds are softer.' if thou be so bold as
    all men say, thou wilt grant me the request i am about to make." "sir
    courteous knight," replies arthur, "if thou cravest battle only, here
    failest thou not to fight." "nay," says the green knight, "i seek no
    fighting. here about on this bench are only beardless children. were i
    arrayed in arms on a high steed no man here would be a match for me
    (ll. 250-282). but it is now christmas time, and this is the new year,
    and i see around me many brave ones;--if any be so bold in his blood
    that dare strike a stroke for another, i shall give him this rich axe
    to do with it whatever he pleases. i shall abide the first blow just as
    i sit, and will stand him a stroke, st

 many realms? forsooth, the renown
    of the round table is overturned by the word of one man's speech, for
    all tremble for dread without a blow being struck!" (ll. 283-313). with
    this he laughed so loud that arthur blushed for very shame, and waxed
    as wroth as the wind. "i know no man," he says, "that is aghast at thy
    great words. give me now thy axe and i will grant thee thy request!"
    arthur seizes the axe, grasps the handle, and sternly brandishes it
    about, while the green knight, with a stern cheer and a dry
    countenance, stroking his beard and drawing down his coat, awaits the
    blow (ll. 314-335). sir gawayne, the nephew of the king, beseeches his
    uncle to let him undertake the encounter; and, at the earnest entreaty
    of his nobles, arthur consents "to give gawayne the game" (ll.
    336-365).

    sir gawayne then takes possession of the axe, but, before the blow is
    dealt, the green knight asks the name of his opponent. "in good faith,"
    answers t

he good knight, "gawayne i am called, that bids thee to this
    buffet, whatever may befall after, and at this time twelvemonth will
    take from thee another, with whatever weapon thou wilt, and with no
    wight else alive." "by gog," quoth the green knight, "it pleases me
    well that i shall receive at thy fist that which i have sought
    here--moreover thou hast truly rehearsed the terms of the
    covenant,--but thou shalt first pledge me thy word that thou wilt seek
    me thyself, wheresoever on earth thou believest i may be found, and
    fetch thee such wages as thou dealest me to-day before this company of
    doughty ones." "where should i seek thee?" replies gawayne, "where is
    thy place? i know not thee, thy court, or thy name. i

ouse, my home, and my own
    name, so that thou mayest follow my track and fulfil the covenant
    between us. if i spend no speech, then speedest thou the better, for
    then mayest thou remain in thy own land and seek no further; but cease
    thy talking[1] (ll. 366-412). take now thy grim tool to thee and let us
    see how thou knockest." "gladly, sir, for sooth," quoth gawayne, and
    his axe he brandishes.

      [footnote 1: this, i think, is the true explanation of slokes.]

    the green knight adjusts himself on the ground, bends slightly his
    head, lays his long lovely locks over his crown, and lays bare his neck
    for the blow. gawayne then gripped the axe, and, raising it on high,
    let it fall quickly upon the knight's neck and severed the head from
    the body. the fair head fell from the neck to the earth, and many
    turned it aside with their feet as it rolled forth. the blood burst
    from the body, yet the knight never faltered nor fell; but boldly he
    started

omes sir gawayne, telling him that he is
    to consider the place as his own. our knight is next conducted to a
    bright bower, where was noble bedding--curtains of pure silk, with
    golden hems, and tarsic tapestries upon the walls and the floors (ll.
    826-859). here the knight doffed his armour and put on rich robes,
    which so well became him, that all declared that a more comely knight
    christ had never made (ll. 860-883).

      [footnote 1: gawayne is now in the castle of the green knight, who,
      divested of his elvish or supernatural character, appears to our
      knight merely as a bold one with a beaver-hued beard.]

    a table is soon raised, and gawayne, having washed, proceeds to meat.
    many dishes are set before him--"sews" of various kinds, fish of all
    kinds, some baked in bread, others broiled on the embers, some boiled,
    and others seasoned with spices. the knight expresses himself well
    pleased, and calls it a most noble and princely feast.

    thee thy blow. we are now in this valley by ourselves, and can do as we
    please (ll. 2217-2246). have, therefore, thy helmet off thy head, and
    'have here thy pay.' let us have no more talk than when thou didst
    strike off my head with a single blow."

    "nay, by god!" quoth gawayne, "i shall not begrudge thee thy will for
    any harm that may happen, but will stand still while thou strikest."

    then he stoops a little and shows his bare neck, unmoved by any fear.
    the green knight takes up his "grim tool," and with all his force
    raises it aloft, as if he meant utterly to destroy him. as the axe came
    gliding down gawayne "shrank a little with the shoulders from the sharp
    iron." the other withheld his weapon, and then reproved the prince with
    many proud words. "thou art not gawayne that is so good esteemed, that
    never feared for no host by hill nor by vale, for now thou fleest for
    fear before thou feelest harm (ll. 2247-2272). such cowardice of that

rcely, he only "severed the hide,"
    causing the blood to flow. when gawayne saw his blood on the snow, he
    quickly seized his helmet and placed it on his head. then he drew out
    his bright sword, and thus angrily spoke: "cease, man, of thy blow, bid
    me no more. i have received a stroke in this place without opposition,
    but if thou givest me any more readily shall i requite thee, of that be
    thou sure. our covenant stipulates one stroke, and therefore now
    cease."

    the green knight, resting on his axe, looks on sir gawayne, as bold and
    fearless he there stood, and then with a loud voice thus addresses the
    knight: "bold knight, be not so wroth, no man here has wronged thee
    (ll. 2305-2339); i promised thee a stroke, and thou hast it, so hold
    thee well pleased. i could have dealt much worse with thee, and caused
    thee much sorrow. two blows i aimed at thee, for twice thou kissedst my
    fair wife; but i struck thee not, because thou restoredst them to me

, sir, thou wert wanting in good faith; but as it proceeded from
    no immorality, thou being only desirous of saving thy life, the less i
    blame thee."

    gawayne stood confounded, the blood rushed into his face, and he shrank
    within himself for very shame. "cursed," he cried, "be cowardice and
    covetousness both; in you are villany and vice, that virtue destroy."
    then he takes off the girdle and throws it to the knight in green,
    cursing his cowardice and covetousness. the green knight, laughing,
    thus spoke: "thou hast confessed so clean, and acknowledged thy faults,
    that i hold thee as pure as thou hadst never forfeited since thou wast
    first born. i give thee, sir, the gold-hemmed girdle as a token of thy
    adventure at the green chapel. come now to my castle, and we shall
    enjoy together the festivities of the new year" (ll. 2340-2406).

    "nay, forsooth," quoth the knight, "but for your kindness may god
    requite you. commend me to that courteous one y

    who knows all your knights at home. she brought me to your hall for to
    essay the prowess of the round table. she wrought this wonder to
    bereave you of your wits, hoping to have grieved guenever and
    affrighted her to death by means of the man that spoke with his head in
    his hand before the high table. she is even thine aunt, arthur's half
    sister; wherefore come to thine aunt, for all my household love thee."

    gawayne refuses to accompany the green knight, and so, with many
    embraces and kind wishes, they separate--the one to his castle, the
    other to arthur's court.

    after passing through many wild ways, our knight recovers from the
    wound in his neck, and at last comes safe and sound to the court of
    king arthur. great then was the joy of all; the king and queen kiss
    their brave knight, and make many enquiries about his journey. he tells
    them of his adventures, hiding nothing--"the chance of the chapel, the
    cheer of
