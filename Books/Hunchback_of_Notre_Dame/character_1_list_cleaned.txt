[CHARACTER]  - 
      a priest at notre dame, frollo is also the novel's antagonist. however, he is not a typical evil character bent on causing pain and suffering; instead, he is very bright and compassionate. he dearly loves his brother, jehan and does everything in his power to make jehan happy after their parents die. he extends the same compassion to quasimodo, who he tries to mold into a scholar just like his brother by teaching him how to read and write. hugo explains frollo's descent into black magic and madness through his failure to bring up both jehan and quasimodo. jehan drinks and gambles all his money away, completely neglecting his studies, while quasimodo's deafness makes it virtually impossible to teach him anything. the hunchback thus becomes both a symbol of failure for frollo as well as a powerful tool of vengeance to wreak his frustrations out on the world. his obsessive lust for la esmerelda causes her to be executed and quasimodo to be tortured. no matter how hard he tries to make her love him, he only ends up causing her pain.
