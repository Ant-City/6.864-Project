Justice Shallow and Justice Silence  - 
      Middle-class country landowners who are also justices of the peace (minor local law officers). They are cousins. Shallow is an old school friend of Falstaff's. The two both live up to their names: Justice Shallow talks endlessly about trivial topics, while Justice Silence barely ever opens his mouth--except to sing raunchy songs when he gets drunk.
