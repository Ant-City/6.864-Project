  scorn'd by my foes, abandon'd by my friends?'
  he said, and sigh'd, and cast a rueful eye:
  our pity kindles, and our passions die.
  we cheer youth to make his own defense,
  and freely tell us what he was, and whence:
  what news he could impart, we long to know,
  and what to credit from a captive foe.

  "his fear at length dismiss'd, he said: 'whate'er
  my fate ordains, my words shall be sincere:
  i neither can nor dare my birth disclaim;
  greece is my country, sinon is my name.
  tho' plung'd by fortune's pow'r in misery,
  't is not in fortune's pow'r to make me lie.
  if any chance has hither brought the name
  of palamedes, not unknown to fame,
  who suffer'd from the malice of the times,
  accus'd and sentenc'd for pretended crimes,
  because these fatal wars he would prevent;
  whose death the wretched greeks too late lament-
  me, then a boy, my father, poor and bare
  of other means, committed to his care,
  his kinsman and companion in the war.

  the grecians had embark'd their naval pow'rs
  from tenedos, and sought our well-known shores,
  safe under covert of the silent night,
  and guided by th' imperial galley's light;
  when sinon, favor'd by the partial gods,
  unlock'd the horse, and op'd his dark abodes;

  'what hope, o pantheus? whither can we run?
  where make a stand? and what may yet be done?'
  scarce had i said, when pantheus, with a groan:
  'troy is no more, and ilium was a town!
  the fatal day, th' appointed hour, is come,
  when wrathful jove's irrevocable doom
  transfers the trojan state to grecian hands.
  the fire consumes the town, the foe commands;
  and armed hosts, an unexpected force,
  break from the bowels of the fatal horse.
  within the gates, proud sinon throws about
  the flames; and foes for entrance press without,
  with thousand others, whom i fear to name,
  more than from argos or mycenae came.
  to sev'ral posts their parties they divide;
  some block the narrow streets, some scour the wide:
  the bold they kill, th' unwary they surprise;
  who fights finds death, and death finds him who flies.
  the warders of the gate but scarce maintain
  th' unequal combat, and resist in vain.'
