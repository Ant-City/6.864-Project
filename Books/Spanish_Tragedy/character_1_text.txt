[prologue]

                enter the ghost of andrea, and with him revenge.

  ghost.  when this eternal substance of my soul
    did live imprison'd in my wanton flesh,
    each in their function serving others' need,
    i was a courtier in the spanish court:
    my name was don andrea; my descent,
    though n

ot ignoble, yet inferior far
    to gracious fortunes of my tender youth,
    for there, in prime and pride of all my years,
    by duteous service and deserving love,
    in secret i possess'd a worthy dame,
    which hight sweet bel-imperia by name.
    but in the harvest of my summer joys
    death's winter nipped the blossoms of my bliss,
    forcing divorce betwixt my love and me;
    for in the late conflict with portingal
    my valour drew me into danger's mouth
    till life to death made passage through my wounds.
    when i was slain, my soul descended straight
    to pass the flowing stream of acheron;
    but churlish charon, only boatman there,
    said that, my rites of burial not perform'd,
    i might not sit amongs

that only she might give me doom.
    pluto was pleas'd, and seal'd it with a kiss.
    forthwith, revenge, she rounded thee in th' ear,
    and bad thee lead me though the gates of horn,
    where dreams have passage in the silent night.
    no sooner had she spoke but we were here,
    i wot not how, in the twinkling of an eye.

  revenge.  then know, andrea, that thou arriv'd
    where thou shalt see the author of thy death,
    don balthazar, the prince of portingal,
    depriv'd of life by bel-imperia:
    here sit we down to see the mystery,
    and serve for chorus in this tragedy.



[act i. scene 1.]
                [the spanish court]

                enter spanish king, general, castille, hieronimo.

  king.  now say, lord general: how fares our camp?

  gen.  all well, my sovereign liege, except some few
    that are deceas'd by fortune of the war.

  king.  but what portends thy cheerful countenance
    and posting to our presence thus in haste?
    speak, man:  hath fortune given us

 hear me speak!

  vice.  away with him!  his sight is second hell!
    keep him till we determine his death.
    if balthazar be dead, he shall not live.

                 [they take him out.]

    villuppo, follow us for thy reward.

                 exit vice[roy].

  villup.  thus have i with an envious forged tale
    deceiv'd the king, betray'd mine enemy,
    and hope for guerdon of my villainy.



[act i.  scene 3.]

                [spain: the palace]

                enter horatio and bel-imperia.

  bel.  signior horatio, this is the place and hour
    wherein i must entreat thee to relate
    the circumstance of don andrea's death,
    who living was my garland's sweetest flower,
    and in his death hath buried my delights.

  hor.  for love of him and service to yourself,
    i'll not refuse this heavy doleful charge;
    yet tears and sighs, i fear, will hinder me.
    when both our armies were enjoin'd in fight,
    your worthy cavalier amidst the thickest,
    for glorious cause

d him down and dew'd him with my tears,
    and sigh'd and sorrow'd as became a friend.
    but neither friendly sorrow, sighs and tears
    could win pale death from his usurped right.
    yet this i did, and less i could not do:
    i saw him honour'd with due funeral.
    this scarf i pluck'd from off his lifeless arm,
    and wear it in remembrance of my friend.

  bel.  i know the scarf: would he had kept it still!
    for, had he liv'd, he would have kept it still,
    and worn it for his bel-imperia's sake;
    for 'twas my favour at his last depart.
    but now wear thou it both for him and me;
    for, after him, thou hast deserv'd it best.
    but, for thy kindness in his life and death,
    be sure, while bel-imperia's life endures,
    she will be don horatio's thankful friend.

  hor.  and, madame, don horatio will not slack
    humbly to serve fair bel-imperia.
    but now, if your good liking stand thereto,
    i'll crave your pardon to go seek the prince;
    for so the duke, your

 father, gave me charge.

                exit.

  bel.  aye, go, horatio; leave me here alone,
    for solitude best fits my cheerless mood.--
    yet what avails to wail andreas death,
    from whence horatio proves my second love?
    had he not lov'd andrea as he did,
    he could not sit in bel-imperia's thoughts.
    but how can love find harbour in my breast,
    till i revenge the death of my belov'd?
    yes, second love shall further my revenge:
    i'll love horatio, my andrea's friend,
    the more to spite the prince that wrought his end;
    and, where don balthazar, that slew my love,
    himself now pleads for favor at my hands,
    he shall, in rigour of my just disdain,
    reap long repentance for his murderous deed,--
    for what was't else but murderous cowardice,
    so many

  in whose fair answer lies my remedy,
    on whose perfection all my thoughts attend,
    on whose aspect mine eyes find beauty's bower,
    in whose translucent breast my heart is lodg'd.

  bel. alas, my lord! these are but words of course,
    and but devis'd to drive me from this place.

                she, going in, lets fall her glove, which
                horatio, coming out, takes up.

  hor.  madame, your glove.

  bel.  thanks, good horatio; take it for thy pains.

                [bel-imperia exits.]

  bal.  signior horatio stoop'd in happy time!

  hor.  i reap'd more grace that i deserv'd or hop'd.

  lor.  my lord, be not dismay'd for what is past;
    you know that women oft are humorous:
    these clouds will overblow with little wind;
    let me alone, i'll scatter them myself.
    meanwhile let us devise to spend the time
    in some delightful sports and revelling.

  hor.  the king, my lords, is coming hither straight
    to feast the portingal ambassador;
    things were

these pleasant sights are sorrow to my soul:
    nothing but league and love and banqueting!

  revenge.  be still, andrea;  ere we go from hence,
    i'll turn their friendship into fell despite,
    their love to mortal hate, their day to night,
    their hope into despair, their peace to war,
    their joys to pain, their bliss to misery.

[act ii.  scene 1.]


                [the duke's castle.]

                enter lorenzo and balthazar.

  lorenzo.  my lord, though bel-imperia seem thus coy,
    let reason hold you in your wonted joy:
    in time the savage bull sustains the yoke,
    in time all haggard hawks will stoop to lure,
    in time small wedges cleave the hardest oak,
    in time the flint is pierc'd with softest shower;
    and she in time will fall from her disdain,
    and rue the sufferance of your friendly pain.

  bal.  no; she is wilder, and more hard withal,
    then beast or bird, or tree or stony wall!
    but wherefore blot i bel-imperia's name?

    and since thou knowest how i have favour'd thee.
    now to these favours will i add reward,
    not with fair words, but store of golden coin
    and lands and living join'd with dignities,
    if thou but satisfy my just demand;
    tell truth and have me for thy lasting friend.

  ped.  whate'er it be your lordship shall demand,
    my bounden duty bids me tell the truth,
    if case it lie in me to tell the truth.

  lor.  then, pedringano, this is my demand;
    whom loves my sister bel-imperia?
    for she reposeth all her trust in thee.
    speak, man, and gain both friendship and reward:
    i mean, whom loves she in andrea's place?

  ped.  alas, my lord, since don andrea's death
    i have no credit with her as before,
    and therefore know not if she love or no.

  lor.  nay, if thou dally, then i am thy foe,
    and fear shall force what friendship cannot win.
    thy death shall bury what thy life conceals.
    thou die'st for more esteeming her than me!

                [dra

  ped.  oh stay, my lord!

  lor.  yet speak the truth, and i will guerdon thee
    and shield thee from whatever can ensue,
    and will conceal whate'er proceeds from thee;
    but, if thou dally once again, thou diest!

  ped.  if madame bel-imperia be in love--

  lor.  what, villain!  ifs and ands?

  ped.  oh stay, my lord!  she loves horatio!

                balthazar starts back.

  lor.  what!  don horatio, our knight-marshall's son?

  ped. even him, my lord.

  lor.  now say but how know'st thou he is her love,
    and thou shalt find me kind and liberal.
    stand up, i say, and fearless tell the truth.

  ped.  she sent him letters,--which myself perus'd,--
    full-fraught with lines and arguments of love,
    preferring him be

  lor.  swear on this cross that what thou say'st is true,
    and that thou wilt conceal what thou hast told.

  ped.  i swear to both, by him that made us all.

  lor.  in hope thine oath is true, here's thy reward.
    but, if i prove thee perjur'd and unjust,
    this very sword whereon thou took'st thine oath
    shall be the worker of thy tragedy.

  ped.  what i have said is true, and shall, for me,
    be still conceal'd from bel-imperia.
    besides, your honour's liberality
    deserves my duteous service ev'n till death.

  lor.  let this be all that thou shall do for me:
    be watchful when and where these lovers meet,
    and give me notice in some secret sort.

  ped.  i will, my lord.

  lor.  then thou shalt find that i am liberal.
    thou know'st that i can more advance thy state
    than she:  be therefore wise and fail me not.
    go and attend her as thy custom is,
    least absence make her think thou dost amiss.

    for love resisted grows impatient.
    i think horatio be my destin'd plague:
    first, in his hand he brandished a sword,
    and with that sword he fiercely waged war,
    and in that war he gave me dangerous wounds,
    and by those wounds he forced me to yield,
    and by my yielding i became his slave;
    now, in his mouth he carries pleasing words,
    which pleasing words do harbour sweet conceits,
    which sweet conceits are lim'd with sly deceits,
    which sly deceits smooth bel-imperia's ears,
    and through her ears dive down into her heart,
    and in her heart set him, where i should stand.
    thus hath he ta'en my body by his force,
    and now by sleight would captivate my soul;
    but in his fall i'll tempt the destinies,
    and either lose my life or win my love.

  lor. let's go, my lord;  our staying stays revenge.
    do but follow me, and gain your love;
    her favour must be won by his remove.

                exeunt.

    our hidden smoke is turn'd to open flame,
    and that with looks and words we feed our thought,--
    two chief contents where more cannot be had,--
    thus in the midst of love's fair blandishments
    why show you sign of inward languishments?

                pedringano showeth all to the prince and

  cip.  although she coy it, as becomes her kind,

    i doubt not, aye, but she will stoop in time;
    and, were she froward,--which she will not be,--
    yet herein shall she follow my advice,
    which is to love him or forgo my love.

    for strengthening of our late-confirmed league;

  hor.  the more thou sitt'st within these leafy bowers,

    thy hate, his love, thy flight, his following thee.

  bel.  brother, you are become an orator--

  hiero.  marry, this follows for hieronimo!
    here break we off our sundry languages,
    and thus conclude i in our vulgar tongue:
    haply you think--but bootless are your thoughts--
    that this is fabulously counterfeit,
    and that we do as all tragedians do,--
    to die today, for fashioning our scene,
    the death of ajax, or s

y hope hath end;
    here lay my heart, and here my heart was slain;
    here lay my treasure, here my treasure lost;
    here lay my bliss, and here my bliss bereft.
    but hope, heart, treasure, joy and bliss,--
    all fled, fail'd, died, yea, all decay'd with this.
    from forth these wounds came breath that gave me life;
    they murder'd me that made these fatal marks.
    the cause was love whence grew this mortal hate:
    the hate, lorenzo and young balthazar;
    the love, my son to bel-imperia.
    but night, the cov'rer of accursed crimes,
    with pitchy silence hush'd these traitors' harms,
    and lent them leave--for they had sorted leisure--
    to take advantage in my garden plot
    upon my son, my dear horatio.
    there merciless they butcher'd up my boy,
    in black, dark night, to pale, dim, cruel death!
    he shrieks; i heard--and yet, methinks, i hear--
    his dismal out-cry echo in the air;
    with soonest speed i hasted to the noise,
    where, hanging on a tree,

 propitious, see, i have reserv'd,
    and never hath it left my bloody heart,
    soliciting remembrance of my vow
    with these, o these accursed murderers!
    which now perform'd, my heart is satisfied.
    and to this end the bashaw i became,
    that might revenge me on lorenzo's life,
    who therefore was appointed to the part
    and was to represent the knight of rhodes,
    that i might kill him more conveniently.
    so, viceroy, was this balthazar thy son--
    that suleiman which bel-imperia
    in person of perseda murdered,--
    solely appointed to that tragic part,
    that she might slay him that offended her.
    poor bel-imperia miss'd her part in this:
    for, though the story saith she should have died,
    yet i, of kindness and of care for her,
    did otherwise determine of her end.
    but love of him whom they did hate too much
    did urge her resolution to be such.
    and princes, now behold hieronimo,
    author and actor in this tragedy,
    bearing his latest f

ving deed?

  vice.  why hast thou murdered my balthazar?

  cas.  why hast thou butcher'd both my children thus?

  hiero.  o good words!  as dear to me was horatio
    as yours, or yours, my lord, to you.
    my guiltless son was by lorenzo slain;
    and by lorenzo and that balthazar
    am i at last revenged thoroughly,--
    upon whose souls may heav'n be yet aveng'd
    with greater far than these afflictions!

  cas.  but who were thy confederates in this?

  vice.  that was thy daughter bel-imperia;
    for by her hand my balthazar was slain,--
    i saw her stab him.

  king.         why speak'st thou not?

  hiero.  what lesser liberty can kings afford
    than harmless silence?  then afford it me!
    sufficeth i may not nor i will not tell thee.

  king.  fetch forth the tortures!
         traitor as thou art, i'll make thee tell!

  hiero.                indeed?
    thou mayst torment me as his wretched son
    hath done in murd'ring my horatio;
    but never shalt thou force me to r

 a dead march, the king of spain

[chorus.]

                enter ghost and revenge.

  ghost.  aye; now my hopes have end in their effects,
    when blood and sorrow finish my desires:
    horatio murder'd in his father's bower,
    vile serberine by pedrigano slain,
    false pedrigano hang'd by quaint device,
    fair isabella by herself misdone,
    prince balthazar by bel-imperia stabb'd,
    the duke of castile and his wicked son
    both done to death by old hieronimo,
    my bel-imperia fallen as dido fell,
    and good hieronimo slain by himself!
    aye, these were spectacles to please my soul.
    now will i beg at lovely proserpine
    that, by the virtue of her princely doom,
    i may consort my friends in pleasing sort,
    and on my foes work just and sharp revenge.
    i'll lead my friend horatio through those fields
    where never-dying wars are still inur

'd;
    i'll lead fair isabella to that train
    where pity weeps but never feeleth pain;
    i'll lead my bel-imperia to those joys
    that vestal virgins and fair queens possess;
    i'll lead hieronimo where orpheus plays,
    adding sweet pleasure to eternal days.
    but say, revenge,--for thou must help or none,--
    against the rest how shall my hate be shown?

  revenge.  this hand shall hale them down to deepest hell,
    where none but furies, bugs and tortures dwell.

  ghost.  then, sweet revenge, do this at my request:
    let me judge and doom them to unrest;
    let loose poor titius from the v
