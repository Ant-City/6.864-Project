 i do not
say to every man, but to a good man, is, that he has had no occasion to
deceive or to defraud others, either intentionally or unintentionally;
and when he departs to the world below he is not in any apprehension
about offerings due to the gods or debts which he owes to men. now to
this peace of mind the possession of wealth greatly contributes; and
therefore i say, that, setting one thing against another, of the many
advantages which wealth has to give, to a man of sense this is in my
opinion the greatest.

well said, cephalus, i replied; but as concerning justice, what is
it?--to speak the truth and to pay your debts--no more than this? and
even to this are there not exceptions? suppose that a friend when in his
right mind has deposited arms with me and he asks for them when he is
not in his right mind, ought i to give them back to him? no one would
say that i ought or that i should be right in doing so, any more than
they would say that i ought always to speak the truth to one who

in no case just.

i agree with you, said polemarchus.

then you and i are prepared to take up arms against any one who
attributes such a saying to simonides or bias or pittacus, or any other
wise man or seer?

i am quite ready to do battle at your side, he said.

shall i tell you whose i believe the saying to be?

whose?

i believe that periander or perdiccas or xerxes or ismenias the theban,
or some other rich and mighty man, who had a great opinion of his own
power, was the first to say that justice is 'doing good to your friends
and harm to your enemies.'

most true, he said.

yes, i said; but if this definition of justice also breaks down, what
other can be offered?

several times in the course of the discussion thrasymachus had made an
attempt to get the argument into his own hands, and had been put down
by the rest of the company, who wanted to hear the end. but when
polemarchus and i had done speaking and there was a pause, he could

also saying that injustice had strength; do you remember?

yes, i remember, he said, but do not suppose that i approve of what you
are saying or have no answer; if however i were to answer, you would be
quite certain to accuse me of haranguing; therefore either permit me to
have my say out, or if you would rather ask, do so, and i will answer
'very good,' as they say to story-telling old women, and will nod 'yes'
and 'no.'

certainly not, i said, if contrary to your real opinion.

yes, he said, i will, to please you, since you will not let me speak.
what else would you have?

nothing in the world, i said; and if you are so disposed i will ask and
you shall answer.

proceed.

then i will repeat the question which i asked before, in order that
our examination of the relative nature of justice and injustice may be
carried on regularly. a statement was made that injustice is stronger
and more powerful than justice, but now justice, having been identified
with wisdom and vi

rk in the soul. if you,
please, then, i will revive the argument of thrasymachus. and first i
will speak of the nature and origin of justice according to the common
view of them. secondly, i will show that all men who practise justice do
so against their will, of necessity, but not as a good. and thirdly, i
will argue that there is reason in this view, for the life of the unjust
is after all better far than the life of the just--if what they say
is true, socrates, since i myself am not of their opinion. but still i
acknowledge that i am perplexed when i hear the voices of thrasymachus
and myriads of others dinning in my ears; and, on the other hand, i have
never yet heard the superiority of justice to injustice maintained by
any one in a satisfactory way. i want to hear justice praised in respect
of itself; then i shall be satisfied, and you are the person from whom
i think that i am most likely to hear this; and therefore i will praise
the unjust life to the utmost of my power, and my manner

 meaning. parents and tutors are always telling their
sons and their wards that they are to be just; but why? not for the sake
of justice, but for the sake of character and reputation; in the hope of
obtaining for him who is reputed just some of those offices, marriages,
and the like which glaucon has enumerated among the advantages accruing
to the unjust from the reputation of justice. more, however, is made of
appearances by this class of persons than by the others; for they
throw in the good opinion of the gods, and will tell you of a shower of
benefits which the heavens, as they say, rain upon the pious; and this
accords with the testimony of the noble hesiod and homer, the first of
whom says, that the gods make the oaks of the just--

   'to bear acorns at their summit, and bees in the middle;
   and the sheep are bowed down with the weight of their fleeces,'

and many other blessings of a like kind are provided for them. and homer
has a very similar strain; for he speaks of one whose fa

t; nothing else does their invention
supply. such is their manner of praising the one and censuring the
other.

once more, socrates, i will ask you to consider another way of speaking
about justice and injustice, which is not confined to the poets, but
is found in prose writers. the universal voice of mankind is always
declaring that justice and virtue are honourable, but grievous and
toilsome; and that the pleasures of vice and injustice are easy of
attainment, and are only censured by law and opinion. they say also that
honesty is for the most part less profitable than dishonesty; and they
are quite ready to call wicked men happy, and to honour them both in
public and private when they are rich or in any other way influential,
while they despise and overlook those who may be weak and poor, even
though acknowledging them to be better than the others. but most
extraordinary of all is their mode of speaking about virtue and the
gods: they say that the gods apportion calamity and misery to many

eplied.

why, he said, you should give them the ordinary conveniences of life.
people who are to be comfortable are accustomed to lie on sofas, and
dine off tables, and they should have sauces and sweets in the modern
style.

yes, i said, now i understand: the question which you would have me
consider is, not only how a state, but how a luxurious state is created;
and possibly there is no harm in this, for in such a state we shall be
more likely to see how justice and injustice originate. in my opinion
the true and healthy constitution of the state is the one which i have
described. but if you wish also to see a state at fever-heat, i have
no objection. for i suspect that many will not be satisfied with the
simpler way of life. they will be for adding sofas, and tables,
and other furniture; also dainties, and perfumes, and incense, and
courtesans, and cakes, all these not of one sort only, but in every
variety; we must go beyond the necessaries of which i was at first
speaking, such as houses

why, yes, said he, those stories are extremely objectionable.

yes, adeimantus, they are stories not to be repeated in our state; the
young man should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes he
is far from doing anything outrageous; and that even if he chastises his
father when he does wrong, in whatever manner, he will only be following
the example of the first and greatest among the gods.

i entirely agree with you, he said; in my opinion those stories are
quite unfit to be repeated.

neither, if we mean our future guardians to regard the habit of
quarrelling among themselves as of all things the basest, should
any word be said to them of the wars in heaven, and of the plots and
fightings of the gods against one another, for they are not true. no,
we shall never mention the battles of the giants, or let them be
embroidered on garments; and we shall be silent about the innumerable
other quarrels of gods and heroes with their frie

and of the words which follow? would you say that these, or any similar
impertinences which private individuals are supposed to address to their
rulers, whether in verse or prose, are well or ill spoken?

they are ill spoken.

they may very possibly afford some amusement, but they do not conduce
to temperance. and therefore they are likely to do harm to our young
men--you would agree with me there?

yes.

and then, again, to make the wisest of men say that nothing in his
opinion is more glorious than

'when the tables are full of bread and meat, and the cup-bearer carries
round wine which he draws from the bowl and pours into the cups,'

is it fit or conducive to temperance for a young man to hear such words?
or the verse

'the saddest of fates is to die and meet destiny from hunger?'

what would you say again to the tale of zeus, who, while other gods and
men were asleep and he the only person awake, lay devising plans, but
forgot them all in a moment through his lust

overcome at the sight of here that he would not even go into the hut,
but wanted to lie with her on the ground, declaring that he had never
been in such a state of rapture before, even when they first met one

'without the knowledge of their parents;'

or that other tale of how hephaestus, because of similar goings on, cast
a chain around ares and aphrodite?

indeed, he said, i am strongly of opinion that they ought not to hear
that sort of thing.

but any deeds of endurance which are done or told by famous men, these
they ought to see and hear; as, for example, what is said in the verses,

'he smote his breast, and thus reproached his heart, endure, my heart;
far worse hast thou endured!'

certainly, he said.

in the next place, we must not let them be receivers of gifts or lovers
of money.

certainly not.

neither must we sing to them of

i quite agree, he said.

thus much of music, which makes a fair ending; for what should be the
end of music if not the love of beauty?

i agree, he said.

after music comes gymnastic, in which our youth are next to be trained.

certainly.

gymnastic as well as music should begin in early years; the training
in it should be careful and should continue through life. now my belief
is,--and this is a matter upon which i should like to have your opinion
in confirmation of my own, but my own belief is,--not that the good body
by any bodily excellence improves the soul, but, on the contrary, that
the good soul, by her own excellence, improves the body as far as this
may be possible. what do you say?

yes, i agree.

then, to the mind when adequately trained, we shall be right in handing
over the more particular care of the body; and in order to avoid
prolixity we will now only give the general outlines of the subject.

very good.

that they must

use he has no pattern of honesty in himself; at the same time, as
the bad are more numerous than the good, and he meets with them oftener,
he thinks himself, and is by others thought to be, rather wise than
foolish.

most true, he said.

then the good and wise judge whom we are seeking is not this man, but
the other; for vice cannot know virtue too, but a virtuous nature,
educated by time, will acquire a knowledge both of virtue and vice: the
virtuous, and not the vicious, man has wisdom--in my opinion.

and in mine also.

this is the sort of medicine, and this is the sort of law, which you
will sanction in your state. they will minister to better natures,
giving health both of soul and of body; but those who are diseased in
their bodies they will leave to die, and the corrupt and incurable souls
they will put an end to themselves.

that is clearly the best thing both for the patients and for the state.

and thus our youth, having been educated only in that simple music
which, as we said, ins

much of
a savage, and that the mere musician is melted and softened beyond what
is good for him.

yet surely, i said, this ferocity only comes from spirit, which, if
rightly educated, would give courage, but, if too much intensified, is
liable to become hard and brutal.

that i quite think.

on the other hand the philosopher will have the quality of gentleness.
and this also, when too much indulged, will turn to softness, but, if
educated rightly, will be gentle and moderate.

true.

and in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities?

assuredly.

and both should be in harmony?

beyond question.

and the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous?

yes.

and the inharmonious is cowardly and boorish?

very true.

and, when a man allows music to play upon him and to pour into his soul
through the funnel of his ears those sweet and soft and melancholy airs
of which we were just now speaking, and his whole life is passed in
warbling and the delights of song; in the first st

d is not this involuntary deprivation caused either by theft, or
force, or enchantment?

still, he replied, i do not understand you.

i fear that i must have been talking darkly, like the tragedians. i only
mean that some men are changed by persuasion and that others forget;
argument steals away the hearts of one class, and time of the other; and
this i call theft. now you understand me?

yes.

those again who are forced, are those whom the violence of some pain or
grief compels to change their opinion.

i understand, he said, and you are quite right.

and you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who change
their minds either under the softer influence of pleasure, or the
sterner influence of fear?

yes, he said; everything that deceives may be said to enchant.

therefore, as i was just now saying, we must enquire who are the best
guardians of their own conviction that what they think the interest
of the state is to be the rule of their lives. we must watch them from

uch the smallest.

and so by reason of the smallest part or class, and of the knowledge
which resides in this presiding and ruling part of itself, the whole
state, being thus constituted according to nature, will be wise; and
this, which has the only knowledge worthy to be called wisdom, has been
ordained by nature to be of all classes the least.

most true.

thus, then, i said, the nature and place in the state of one of the four
virtues has somehow or other been discovered.

and, in my humble opinion, very satisfactorily discovered, he replied.

again, i said, there is no difficulty in seeing the nature of courage,
and in what part that quality resides which gives the name of courageous
to the state.

how do you mean?

why, i said, every one who calls any state courageous or cowardly, will
be thinking of the part which fights and goes out to war on the state's
behalf.

no one, he replied, would ever think of any other.

the rest of the citizens may be courageous or may be cowardly, but thei

r
courage or cowardice will not, as i conceive, have the effect of making
the city either the one or the other.

certainly not.

the city will be courageous in virtue of a portion of herself which
preserves under all circumstances that opinion about the nature of
things to be feared and not to be feared in which our legislator
educated them; and this is what you term courage.

i should like to hear what you are saying once more, for i do not think
that i perfectly understand you.

i mean that courage is a kind of salvation.

salvation of what?

of the opinion respecting things to be feared, what they are and of
what nature, which the law implants through education; and i mean by the
words 'under all circumstances' to intimate that in
 
 ___________________________
 
 pleasure or in pain,
or under the influence of desire or fear, a man preserves, and does not
lose this opinion. shall i give you an illustration?

if you please.

you know, i said, that dyers, when they want to dye wool for making the
true sea-purple, begin by selecting their white colour first; this they
prepare and dress with much care and pains, in order that the white
ground may take the purple hue in full perfection. the dyeing then
proceeds; and whatever is dyed in this manner becomes a fast colour,
and no washing either with lyes or without them can take away the bloom.
but, when the ground has n
 
 ___________________________
 
ot been duly prepared, you will have noticed
how poor is the look either of purple or of any other colour.

yes, he said; i know that they have a washed-out and ridiculous
appearance.

then now, i said, you will understand what our object was in selecting
our soldiers, and educating them in music and gymnastic; we were
contriving influences which would prepare them to take the dye of the
laws in perfection, and the colour of their opinion about dangers and
of every other opinion was to be indelibly fixed by their nurture
and training, not to be washed away by such potent lyes as
pleasure--mightier agent far in washing the soul than any soda or lye;
or by sorrow, fear, and desire, the mightiest of all other solvents. and
this sort of universal saving power of true opinion in conformity with
law about real and false dangers i call and maintain to be courage,
unless you disagree.

but i agree, he replied; for i suppose that you mean to exclude mere
uninstructed courage, s

in your opinion, is not the courage which the law ordains, and ought to

most certainly.

then i may infer courage to be such as you describe?

why, yes, said i, you may, and if you add the words 'of a citizen,'
you will not be far wrong;--hereafter, if you like, we will carry the
examination further, but at present we are seeking not for courage but
justice; and for the purpose of our enquiry we have said enough.

you are right, he replied.

two virtues remain to be discovered in the state-

tself, if the words
'temperance' and 'self-mastery' truly express the rule of the better
part over the worse.

yes, he said, i see that what you say is true.

let me further note that the manifold and complex pleasures and desires
and pains are generally found in children and women and servants, and in
the freemen so called who are of the lowest and more numerous class.

certainly, he said.

whereas the simple and moderate desires which follow reason, and are
under the guidance of mind and true opinion, are to be found only in a
few, and those the best born and best educated.

very true.

these two, as you may perceive, have a place in our state; and the
meaner desires of the many are held down by the virtuous desires and
wisdom of the few.

that i perceive, he said.

then if there be any city which may be described as master of its own
pleasures and desires, and master of itself, ours may claim such a
designation?

certainly, he replied.

it may also be called temperate, and for the same rea

abstracted; and, that this is the ultimate cause and condition of the
existence of all of them, and while remaining in them is also their
preservative; and we were saying that if the three were discovered by
us, justice would be the fourth or remaining one.

that follows of necessity.

if we are asked to determine which of these four qualities by its
presence contributes most to the excellence of the state, whether the
agreement of rulers and subjects, or the preservation in the soldiers of
the opinion which the law ordains about the true nature of dangers, or
wisdom and watchfulness in the rulers, or whether this other which i am
mentioning, and which is found in children and women, slave and freeman,
artisan, ruler, subject,--the quality, i mean, of every one doing his
own work, and not being a busybody, would claim the palm--the question
is not so easily answered.

certainly, he replied, there would be a difficulty in saying which.

then the power of each individual in the state to do his

son, and
the two subject ones of spirit and desire are equally agreed that reason
ought to rule, and do not rebel?

certainly, he said, that is the true account of temperance whether in
the state or individual.

and surely, i said, we have explained again and again how and by virtue
of what quality a man will be just.

that is very certain.

and is justice dimmer in the individual, and is her form different, or
is she the same which we found her to be in the state?

there is no difference in my opinion, he said.

because, if any doubt is still lingering in our minds, a few commonplace
instances will satisfy us of the truth of what i am saying.

what sort of instances do you mean?

if the case is put to us, must we not admit that the just state, or
the man who is trained in the principles of such a state, will be less
likely than the unjust to make away with a deposit of gold or silver?
would any one deny this?

no one, he replied.

will the just man or citizen ever be guilty of sacrilege or t

o longer many, but has become one entirely temperate and perfectly

a matter of property, or in the treatment of the body, or in some affair
of politics or private business; always thinking and calling that which
preserves and co-operates with this harmonious condition, just and good
action, and the knowledge which presides over it, wisdom, and that which
at any time impairs this condition, he will call unjust action, and the
opinion which presides over it ignorance.

you have said the exact truth, socrates.

very good; and if we were to affirm that we had discovered the just man
and the just state, and the nature of justice in each of them, we should
not be telling a falsehood?

most certainly not.

may we say so, then?

let us say so.

and now, i said, injustice has to be considered.

clearly.

must not injustice be a strife which arises among the three
principles--a meddlesomeness, and interference, and rising up of a pa

 not right, adeimantus?

yes, he said; but what is right in this particular case, like everything
else, requires to be explained; for community may be of many kinds.
please, therefore, to say what sort of community you mean. we have been
long expecting that you would tell us something about the family life
of your citizens--how they will bring children into the world, and rear
them when they have arrived, and, in general, what is the nature of this
community of women and children--for we are of opinion that the right
or wrong management of such matters will have a great and paramount
influence on the state for good or for evil. and now, since the question
is still undetermined, and you are taking in hand another state, we have
resolved, as you heard, not to let you go until you give an account of
all this.

to that resolution, said glaucon, you may regard me as saying agreed.

and without more ado, said thrasymachus, you may consider us all to be
equally agreed.

i said, you know not what you

law says that when a man is acquitted he is free from
guilt, and what holds at law may hold in argument.

then why should you mind?

well, i replied, i suppose that i must retrace my steps and say what i
perhaps ought to have said before in the proper place. the part of the
men has been played out, and now properly enough comes the turn of the
women. of them i will proceed to speak, and the more readily since i am
invited by you.

for men born and educated like our citizens, the only way, in my
opinion, of arriving at a right conclusion about the possession and
use of women and children is to follow the path on which we originally
started, when we said that the men were to be the guardians and
watchdogs of the herd.

true.

let us further suppose the birth and education of our women to be
subject to similar or nearly similar regulations; then we shall see
whether the result accords with our design.

what do you mean?

what i mean may be put into the form of a question, i said: are dogs

rmined to speak our minds, we must not
fear the jests of the wits which will be directed against this sort of
innovation; how they will talk of women's attainments both in music
and gymnastic, and above all about their wearing armour and riding upon
horseback!

very true, he replied.

yet having begun we must go forward to the rough places of the law; at
the same time begging of these gentlemen for once in their life to be
serious. not long ago, as we shall remind them, the hellenes were of the
opinion, which is still generally received among the barbarians, that
the sight of a naked man was ridiculous and improper; and when first the
cretans and then the lacedaemonians introduced the custom, the wits of
that day might equally have ridiculed the innovation.

no doubt.

but when experience showed that to let all things be uncovered was far
better than to cover them up, and the ludicrous effect to the outward
eye vanished before the better principle which reason asserted, then the
man was perce

ter of guardians.

right, he replied.

both the community of property and the community of families, as i am
saying, tend to make them more truly guardians; they will not tear
the city in pieces by differing about 'mine' and 'not mine;' each man
dragging any acquisition which he has made into a separate house of his
own, where he has a separate wife and children and private pleasures and
pains; but all will be affected as far as may be by the same pleasures
and pains because they are all of one opinion about what is near and
dear to them, and therefore they all tend towards a common end.

certainly, he replied.

and as they have nothing but their persons which they can call their
own, suits and complaints will have no existence among them; they will
be delivered from all those quarrels of which money or children or
relations are the occasion.

of course they will.

neither will trials for assault or insult ever be likely to occur among
them. for that equals should defend themselves against eq
 
 ___________________________
 
es, he replied, we most certainly must.

neither shall we offer up arms at the temples of the gods, least of all
the arms of hellenes, if we care to maintain good feeling with other
hellenes; and, indeed, we have reason to fear that the offering of
spoils taken from kinsmen may be a pollution unless commanded by the god
himself?

very true.

again, as to the devastation of hellenic territory or the burning of
houses, what is to be the practice?

may i have the pleasure, he said, of hearing your opinion?

both should be forbidden, in my judgment; i would take the annual
produce and no more. shall i tell you why?

pray do.

why, you see, there is a difference in the names 'discord' and 'war,'
and i imagine that there is also a difference in their natures; the one
is expressive of what is internal and domestic, the other of what is
external and foreign; and the first of the two is termed discord, and
only the second, war.

that is a very proper distinction, he replied.

and may i not observe wit

l object?

i should certainly say that such an one was dreaming.

but take the case of the other, who recognises the existence of absolute
beauty and is able to distinguish the idea from the objects which
participate in the idea, neither putting the objects in the place of the
idea nor the idea in the place of the objects--is he a dreamer, or is he
awake?

he is wide awake.

and may we not say that the mind of the one who knows has knowledge, and
that the mind of the other, who opines only, has opinion?

certainly.

but suppose that the latter should quarrel with us and dispute our
statement, can we administer any soothing cordial or advice to him,
without revealing to him that there is sad disorder in his wits?

we must certainly offer him some good advice, he replied.

come, then, and let us think of something to say to him. shall we begin
by assuring him that he is welcome to any knowledge which he may have,
and that we are rejoiced at his having it? but we should like to ask him
a questio

hing can be more certain.

good. but if there be anything which is of such a nature as to be and
not to be, that will have a place intermediate between pure being and
the absolute negation of being?

yes, between them.

and, as knowledge corresponded to being and ignorance of necessity to
not-being, for that intermediate between being and not-being there has
to be discovered a corresponding intermediate between ignorance and
knowledge, if there be such?

certainly.

do we admit the existence of opinion?

undoubtedly.

as being the same with knowledge, or another faculty?

another faculty.

then opinion and knowledge have to do with different kinds of matter
corresponding to this difference of faculties?

yes.

and knowledge is relative to being and knows being. but before i proceed
further i will make a division.

what division?

i will begin by placing faculties in a class by themselves: they are
powers in us, and in all other things, by which we do as we do. sight
and hearing, for example, 
 
 ___________________________
 
ot apply to them. in
speaking of a faculty i think only of its sphere and its result; and
that which has the same sphere and the same result i call the same
faculty, but that which has another sphere and another result i call
different. would that be your way of speaking?

yes.

and will you be so very good as to answer one more question? would you
say that knowledge is a faculty, or in what class would you place it?

certainly knowledge is a faculty, and the mightiest of all faculties.

and is opinion also a faculty?

certainly, he said; for opinion is that with which we are able to form
an opinion.

and yet you were acknowledging a little while ago that knowledge is not
the same as opinion?

why, yes, he said: how can any reasonable being ever identify that which
is infallible with that which errs?

an excellent answer, proving, i said, that we are quite conscious of a
distinction between them.

yes.

then knowledge and opinion having distinct powers have also distinct
spheres or subject-ma
 
 ___________________________
 
tters?

that is certain.

being is the sphere or subject-matter of knowledge, and knowledge is to
know the nature of being?

yes.

and opinion is to have an opinion?

yes.

and do we know what we opine? or is the subject-matter of opinion the
same as the subject-matter of knowledge?

nay, he replied, that has been already disproven; if difference in
faculty implies difference in the sphere or subject-matter, and if, as
we were saying, opinion and knowledge are distinct faculties, then the
sphere of knowledge and of opinion cannot be the same.

then if being is the subject-matter of knowledge, something else must be
the subject-matter of opinion?

yes, something else.

well then, is not-being the subject-matter of opinion? or, rather, how
can there be an opinion at all about not-being? reflect: when a man
has an opinion, has he not an opinion about something? can he have an
opinion which is an opinion about nothing?

impossible.

who has an opinion has an opinion about some one thing?

yes.

and not-being is not one thing but, properly speaking, nothing?

true.

of not-being, ignorance was assumed to be the necessary correlative; of
being, knowledge?

true, he said.

then opinion is not concerned either with being or with not-being?

not with either.

and can therefore neither be ignorance nor knowledge?

that seems to be true.

but is opinion to be sought without and beyond either of them, in
a greater clearness than knowledge, or in a greater darkness than
ignorance?

in neither.

then i suppose that opinion appears to you to be darker than knowledge,
but lighter than ignorance?

both; and in no small degree.

and also to be within and between them?

yes.

then you would infer that opinion is intermediate?

no question.

but were we not saying before, that if anything appeared to be of a sort
which is and is not at the same time, t

hat sort of thing would appear
also to lie in the interval between pure being and absolute not-being;
and that the corresponding faculty is neither knowledge nor ignorance,
but will be found in the interval between them?

true.

and in that interval there has now been discovered something which we
call opinion?

there has.

then what remains to be discovered is the object which partakes equally
of the nature of being and not-being, and cannot rightly be termed
either, pure and simple; this unknown term, when discovered, we may
truly call the subject of opinion, and assign each to their proper
faculty,--the extremes to the faculties of the extremes and the mean to
the faculty of the mean.

true.

this being premised, i would ask the gentleman who is of opinion that
there is no absolute or unchangeable

 idea of beauty--in whose opinion
the beautiful is the manifold--he, i say, your lover of beautiful
sights, who cannot bear to be told that the beautiful is one, and the
just is one, or that anything is one--to him i would appeal, saying,
will you be so very kind, sir, as to tell us whether, of all these
beautiful things, there is one which will not be found ugly; or of the
just, which will not be found unjust; or of the holy, which will not
also be unholy?

no, he replied; the beautiful will in some point of view be found ugly

g? for they are clearly not in greater
darkness or negation than not-being, or more full of light and existence
than being.

that is quite true, he said.

thus then we seem to have discovered that the many ideas which the
multitude entertain about the beautiful and about all other things are
tossing about in some region which is half-way between pure being and
pure not-being?

we have.

yes; and we had before agreed that anything of this kind which we might
find was to be described as matter of opinion, and not as matter of
knowledge; being the intermediate flux which is caught and detained by
the intermediate faculty.

quite true.

then those who see the many beautiful, and who yet neither see absolute
beauty, nor can follow any guide who points the way thither; who see the
many just, and not absolute justice, and the like,--such persons may be
said to have opinion but not knowledge?

that is certain.

but those who see the absolute and eternal and immutable may be said to

the one love and embrace the subjects of knowledge, the other those of
opinion? the latter are the same, as i dare say you will remember, who
listened to sweet sounds and gazed upon fair colours, but would not
tolerate the existence of absolute beauty.

yes, i remember.

shall we then be guilty of any impropriety in calling them lovers of
opinion rather than lovers of wisdom, and will they be very angry with
us for thus describing them?

i shall tell them not to be angry; no man should be angry at what is
true.

but those who love the truth in each thing are to be called lovers of
wisdom and not lovers of opinion.

assuredly.

and thus, glaucon, after the argument has gone a weary way, the true and
the false philosophers have at length appeared in view.

i do not think, he said, that the way could have been shortened.

 each step of the argument, he sees as a fact that the
votaries of philosophy, when they carry on the study, not only in youth
as a part of education, but as the pursuit of their maturer years, most
of them become strange monsters, not to say utter rogues, and that those
who may be considered the best of them are made useless to the world by
the very study which you extol.

well, and do you think that those who say so are wrong?

i cannot tell, he replied; but i should like to know what is your
opinion.

hear my answer; i am of opinion that they are quite right.

then how can you be justified in saying that cities will not cease from
evil until philosophers rule in them, when philosophers are acknowledged
by us to be of no use to them?

you ask a question, i said, to which a reply can only be given in a
parable.

yes, socrates; and that is a way of speaking to which you are not at all
accustomed, i suppose.

i perceive, i said, that you are vastly amused at having plunged me into

therefore, if
i am to plead their cause, i must have recourse to fiction, and put
together a figure made up of many things, like the fabulous unions of
goats and stags which are found in pictures. imagine then a fleet or a
ship in which there is a captain who is taller and stronger than any of
the crew, but he is a little deaf and has a similar infirmity in sight,
and his knowledge of navigation is not much better. the sailors are
quarrelling with one another about the steering--every one is of opinion
that he has a right to steer, though he has never learned the art of
navigation and cannot tell who taught him or when he learned, and will
further assert that it cannot be taught, and they are ready to cut in
pieces any one who says the contrary. they throng about the captain,
begging and praying him to commit the helm to them; and if at any time
they do not prevail, but others are preferred to them, they kill the
others or throw them overboard, and having first chained up the noble
captain's

who are called by them good-for-nothings and star-gazers.

precisely so, he said.

for these reasons, and among men like these, philosophy, the noblest
pursuit of all, is not likely to be much esteemed by those of the
opposite faction; not that the greatest and most lasting injury is done
to her by her opponents, but by her own professing followers, the same
of whom you suppose the accuser to say, that the greater number of them
are arrant rogues, and the best are useless; in which opinion i agreed.

yes.

and the reason why the good are useless has now been explained?

true.

then shall we proceed to show that the corruption of the majority is
also unavoidable, and that this is not to be laid to the charge of
philosophy any more than the other?

by all means.

and let us ask and answer in turn, first going back to the description
of the gentle and noble nature. truth, as you will remember, was his
leader, whom he followed always and in all things; failing in this, he

re, or a camp, or in any other popular resort,
and there is a great uproar, and they praise some things which are
being said or done, and blame other things, equally exaggerating both,
shouting and clapping their hands, and the echo of the rocks and the
place in which they are assembled redoubles the sound of the praise or
blame--at such a time will not a young man's heart, as they say, leap
within him? will any private training enable him to stand firm against
the overwhelming flood of popular opinion? or will he be carried away
by the stream? will he not have the notions of good and evil which the
public in general have--he will do as they do, and as they are, such
will he be?

yes, socrates; necessity will compel him.

and yet, i said, there is a still greater necessity, which has not been
mentioned.

what is that?

the gentle force of attainder or confiscation or death, which, as you
are aware, these new sophists and educators, who are the public, apply
when their words are powerless.

in

deed they do; and in right good earnest.

now what opinion of any other sophist, or of any private person, can be
expected to overcome in such an unequal contest?

none, he replied.

no, indeed, i said, even to make the attempt is a great piece of folly;
there neither is, nor has been, nor is ever likely to be, any different
type of character which has had no other training in virtue but that
which is supplied by public opinion--i speak, my friend, of human virtue
only; what is more than human, as the proverb says, is not included:
for i would not have you ignorant that, in the present evil state of
governments, whatever is saved and comes to good is saved by the power
of god, as we may truly say.

i quite assent, he replied.

then let me crave your assent also to a further observation.

what are you going to say?

why, that all those mercenary individuals, whom the many call sophists
and whom they deem to be their ad

versaries, do, in fact, teach nothing
but the opinion of the many, that is to say, the opinions of their
assemblies; and this is their wisdom. i might compare them to a man who
should study the tempers and desires of a mighty strong beast who is
fed by him--he would learn how to approach and handle him, also at what
times and from what causes he is dangerous or the reverse, and what
is the meaning of his several cries, and by what sounds, when another
utters them, he is soothed or infuriated; and you may suppose further,
that when, by continually attending upon him, he has become perfect

a most exact parallel.

what will be the issue of such marriages? will they not be vile and
bastard?

there can be no question of it.

and when persons who are unworthy of education approach philosophy and
make an alliance with her who is in a rank above them what sort of
ideas and opinions are likely to be generated? will they not be sophisms
captivating to the ear, having nothing in them genuine, or worthy of or
akin to true wisdom?

no doubt, he said.

then, adeimantus, i said, the worthy disciples of philosophy will be but
a small remnant: perchance some noble and well-educated person, detained
by exile in her service, who in the absence of corrupting influences
remains devoted to her; or some lofty soul born in a mean city, the
politics of which he contemns and neglects; and

but not the greatest, unless he find a state suitable
to him; for in a state which is suitable to him, he will have a larger
growth and be the saviour of his country, as well as of himself.

the causes why philosophy is in such an evil name have now been
sufficiently explained: the injustice of the charges against her has
been shown--is there anything more which you wish to say?

nothing more on that subject, he replied; but i should like to know
which of the governments now existing is in your opinion the one adapted
to her.

not any of them, i said; and that is precisely the accusation which i
bring against them--not one of them is worthy of the philosophic nature,
and hence that nature is warped and estranged;--as the exotic seed
which is sown in a foreign land becomes denaturalized, and is wont to be
overpowered and to lose itself in the new soil, even so this growth
of philosophy, instead of persisting, degenerates and receives another
character. but if philosophy ever finds in the state

 far as he can be, into the proportion and likeness of
virtue--such a man ruling in a city which bears the same image, they
have never yet seen, neither one nor many of them--do you think that
they ever did?

no indeed.

no, my friend, and they have seldom, if ever, heard free and noble
sentiments; such as men utter when they are earnestly and by every means
in their power seeking after truth for the sake of knowledge, while
they look coldly on the subtleties of controversy, of which the end is
opinion and strife, whether they meet with them in the courts of law or
in society.

they are strangers, he said, to the words of which you speak.

and this was what we foresaw, and this was the reason why truth forced
us to admit, not without fear and hesitation, that neither cities nor
states nor individuals will ever attain perfection until the small
class of philosophers whom we termed useless but not corrupt are
providentially compelled, whether they will or not, to take care of the
state, and unt

 right.

if then, in the countless ages of the past, or at the present hour in
some foreign clime which is far away and beyond our ken, the perfected
philosopher is or has been or hereafter shall be compelled by a superior
power to have the charge of the state, we are ready to assert to the
death, that this our constitution has been, and is--yea, and will be
whenever the muse of philosophy is queen. there is no impossibility in
all this; that there is a difficulty, we acknowledge ourselves.

my opinion agrees with yours, he said.

but do you mean to say that this is not the opinion of the multitude?

i should imagine not, he replied.

o my friend, i said, do not attack the multitude: they will change their
minds, if, not in an aggressive spirit, but gently and with the view
of soothing them and removing their dislike of over-education, you show
them your philosophers as they really are and describe as you were just
now doing their character and profession, and then mankind will see that
he of

knowledge our state will be
perfectly ordered?

of course, he replied; but i wish that you would tell me whether you
conceive this supreme principle of the good to be knowledge or pleasure,
or different from either?

aye, i said, i knew all along that a fastidious gentleman like you would
not be contented with the thoughts of other people about these matters.

true, socrates; but i must say that one who like you has passed a
lifetime in the study of philosophy should not be always repeating the
opinions of others, and never telling his own.

well, but has any one a right to say positively what he does not know?

not, he said, with the assurance of positive certainty; he has no right
to do that: but he may say what he thinks, as a matter of opinion.

and do you not know, i said, that all mere opinions are bad, and the
best of them blind? you would not deny that those who have any true
notion without intelligence are only like blind men who feel their way
along the road?

very true.

and do you

 longer shining, but the moon
and stars only, see dimly, and are nearly blind; they seem to have no
clearness of vision in them?

very true.

but when they are directed towards objects on which the sun shines, they
see clearly and there is sight in them?

certainly.

and the soul is like the eye: when resting upon that on which truth and
being shine, the soul perceives and understands, and is radiant with
intelligence; but when turned towards the twilight of becoming and
perishing, then she has opinion only, and goes blinking about, and
is first of one opinion and then of another, and seems to have no
intelligence?

just so.

now, that which imparts truth to the known and the power of knowing to
the knower is what i would have you term the idea of good, and this
you will deem to be the cause of science, and of truth in so far as
the latter becomes the subject of knowledge; beautiful too, as are both
truth and knowledge, you will be right in esteeming this other nature as
more beautiful than e

 and by images i
mean, in the first place, shadows, and in the second place, reflections
in water and in solid, smooth and polished bodies and the like: do you
understand?

yes, i understand.

imagine, now, the other section, of which this is only the resemblance,
to include the animals which we see, and everything that grows or is
made.

very good.

would you not admit that both the sections of this division have
different degrees of truth, and that the copy is to the original as the
sphere of opinion is to the sphere of knowledge?

most undoubtedly.

next proceed to consider the manner in which the sphere of the
intellectual is to be divided.

in what manner?

thus:--there are two subdivisions, in the lower of which the soul uses
the figures given by the former division as images; the enquiry can only
be hypothetical, and instead of going upwards to a principle descends
to the other end; in the higher of the two, the soul passes out of
hypotheses, and goes up to a principle which is above h
 
 ___________________________
 
otheses only: these are also
contemplated by the understanding, and not by the senses: yet, because
they start from hypotheses and do not ascend to a principle, those who
contemplate them appear to you not to exercise the higher reason
upon them, although when a first principle is added to them they are
cognizable by the higher reason. and the habit which is concerned
with geometry and the cognate sciences i suppose that you would term
understanding and not reason, as being intermediate between opinion and
reason.

you have quite conceived my meaning, i said; and now, corresponding to
these four divisions, let there be four faculties in the soul--reason
answering to the highest, understanding to the second, faith (or
conviction) to the third, and perception of shadows to the last--and let
there be a scale of them, and let us suppose that the several faculties
have clearness in the same degree that their objects have truth.

i understand, he replied, and give my assent, and accept your

he offender,
and they would put him to death.

no question, he said.

this entire allegory, i said, you may now append, dear glaucon, to the
previous argument; the prison-house is the world of sight, the light of
the fire is the sun, and you will not misapprehend me if you interpret
the journey upwards to be the ascent of the soul into the intellectual
world according to my poor belief, which, at your desire, i have
expressed--whether rightly or wrongly god knows. but, whether true or
false, my opinion is that in the world of knowledge the idea of good
appears last of all, and is seen only with an effort; and, when seen,
is also inferred to be the universal author of all things beautiful and
right, parent of light and of the lord of light in this visible world,
and the immediate source of reason and truth in the intellectual; and
that this is the power upon which he who would act rationally either in
public or private life must have his eye fixed.

i agree, he said, as far as i am able to und
 
 ___________________________
 
ld you say?

i should rather say that those who elevate astronomy into philosophy
appear to me to make us look downwards and not upwards.

what do you mean? he asked.

you, i replied, have in your mind a truly sublime conception of our
knowledge of the things above. and i dare say that if a person were to
throw his head back and study the fretted ceiling, you would still think
that his mind was the percipient, and not his eyes. and you are very
likely right, and i may be a simpleton: but, in my opinion, that
knowledge only which is of being and of the unseen can make the soul
look upwards, and whether a man gapes at the heavens or blinks on the
ground, seeking to learn some particular of sense, i would deny that he
can learn, for nothing of that sort is matter of science; his soul is
looking downwards, not upwards, whether his way to knowledge is by water
or by land, whether he floats, or only lies on his back.

i acknowledge, he said, the justice of your rebuke. still, i should like
to ascer

 like reality; of that i am confident.

doubtless, he replied.

but i must also remind you, that the power of dialectic alone can reveal
this, and only to one who is a disciple of the previous sciences.

of that assertion you may be as confident as of the last.

and assuredly no one will argue that there is any other method
of comprehending by any regular process all true existence or of
ascertaining what each thing is in its own nature; for the arts in
general are concerned with the desires or opinions of men, or are
cultivated with a view to production and construction, or for the
preservation of such productions and constructions; and as to the
mathematical sciences which, as we were saying, have some apprehension
of true being--geometry and the like--they only dream about being,
but never can they behold the waking reality so long as they leave the
hypotheses which they use unexamined, and are unable to give an account
of them. for when a man knows not his own first principle, and when th

ible, he said.

then dialectic, and dialectic alone, goes directly to the first
principle and is the only science which does away with hypotheses in
order to make her ground secure; the eye of the soul, which is literally
buried in an outlandish slough, is by her gentle aid lifted upwards;
and she uses as handmaids and helpers in the work of conversion, the
sciences which we have been discussing. custom terms them sciences,
but they ought to have some other name, implying greater clearness
than opinion and less clearness than science: and this, in our previous
sketch, was called understanding. but why should we dispute about names
when we have realities of such importance to consider?

why indeed, he said, when any name will do which expresses the thought
of the mind with clearness?

at any rate, we are satisfied, as before, to have four divisions;
two for intellect and two for opinion, and to call the first division
science, the second understanding, the third belief, and the fourth
percepti

on of shadows, opinion being concerned with becoming, and
intellect with being; and so to make a proportion:--

as being is to becoming, so is pure intellect to opinion. and as
intellect is to opinion, so is science to belief, and understanding to
the perception of shadows.

but let us defer the further correlation and subdivision of the subjects
of opinion and of intellect, for it will be a long enquiry, many times
longer than this has been.

as far as i understand, he said, i agree.

and do you also agree, i said, in describing the dialectician as one who
attains a conception of the essence of each thing? and he who does not
possess and is therefore unable to impart this conception, in
whatever degree he fails, may in that degree also be said to fail in
intelligence? will you admit so much?

yes, he said; how can i deny it?

and you would say th
 
 ___________________________
 
e same of the conception of the good? until the
person is able to abstract and define rationally the idea of good,
and unless he can run the gauntlet of all objections, and is ready to
disprove them, not by appeals to opinion, but to absolute truth, never
faltering at any step of the argument--unless he can do all this, you
would say that he knows neither the idea of good nor any other good; he
apprehends only a shadow, if anything at all, which is given by opinion
and not by science;--dreaming and slumbering in this life, before he
is well awake here, he arrives at the world below, and has his final
quietus.

in all that i should most certainly agree with you.

and surely you would not have the children of your ideal state, whom you
are nurturing and educating--if the ideal ever becomes a reality--you
would not allow the future rulers to be like posts (literally 'lines,'
probably the starting-point of a race-course.), having no reason in
them, and yet to

image which will adequately describe him.

yes, he said, that is the only adequate image of him.

and when his other lusts, amid clouds of incense and perfumes and
garlands and wines, and all the pleasures of a dissolute life, now let
loose, come buzzing around him, nourishing to the utmost the sting of
desire which they implant in his drone-like nature, then at last this
lord of the soul, having madness for the captain of his guard, breaks
out into a frenzy: and if he finds in himself any good opinions or
appetites in process of formation, and there is in him any sense of
shame remaining, to these better principles he puts an end, and casts
them forth until he has purged away temperance and brought in madness to
the full.

yes, he said, that is the way in which the tyrannical man is generated.

and is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant?

i should not wonder.

further, i said, has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant?

he has.

and you know that a man who is

e of friends, for the sake of some
newly-found blooming youth who is the reverse of indispensable?

yes, indeed, he said; i believe that he would.

truly, then, i said, a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and
mother.

he is indeed, he replied.

he first takes their property, and when that fails, and pleasures are
beginning to swarm in the hive of his soul, then he breaks into a house,
or steals the garments of some nightly wayfarer; next he proceeds to
clear a temple. meanwhile the old opinions which he had when a child,
and which gave judgment about good and evil, are overthrown by those
others which have just been emancipated, and are now the body-guard of
love and share his empire. these in his democratic days, when he was
still subject to the laws and to his father, were only let loose in
the dreams of sleep. but now that he is under the dominion of love, he
becomes always and in waking reality what he was then very rarely and in
a dream only; he will commit the foulest murder, o

most true.

and this is he who being by nature most of a tyrant bears rule, and the
longer he lives the more of a tyrant he becomes.

that is certain, said glaucon, taking his turn to answer.

and will not he who has been shown to be the wickedest, be also the most
miserable? and he who has tyrannized longest and most, most continually
and truly miserable; although this may not be the opinion of men in
general?

yes, he said, inevitably.

and must not the tyrannical man be like the tyrannical state, and
the democratical man like the democratical state; and the same of the
others?

certainly.

and as state is to state in virtue and happiness, so is man in relation
to man?

to be sure.

then comparing our original city, which was under a king, and the city
which is under a tyrant, how do they stand as to virtue?

they are the opposite extremes, he said, for one is the very best and
th
 
 ___________________________
 
e other is the very worst.

there can be no mistake, i said, as to which is which, and therefore
i will at once enquire whether you would arrive at a similar decision
about their relative happiness and misery. and here we must not allow
ourselves to be panic-stricken at the apparition of the tyrant, who is
only a unit and may perhaps have a few retainers about him; but let us
go as we ought into every corner of the city and look all about, and
then we will give our opinion.

a fair invitation, he replied; and i see, as every one must, that a
tyranny is the wretchedest form of government, and the rule of a king
the happiest.

and in estimating the men too, may i not fairly make a like request,
that i should have a judge whose mind can enter into and see through
human nature? he must not be like a child who looks at the outside and
is dazzled at the pompous aspect which the tyrannical nature assumes to
the beholder, but let him be one who has a clear insight. may i

generally, and the best of them are miserably degraded and enslaved.

then if the man is like the state, i said, must not the same rule

in him are enslaved; and there is a small ruling part, which is also the
worst and maddest.

inevitably.

and would you say that the soul of such an one is the soul of a freeman,
or of a slave?

he has the soul of a slave, in my opinion.

and the state which is enslaved under a tyrant is utterly incapable of
acting voluntarily?

utterly incapable.

and also the soul which is under a tyrant (i am speaking of the soul
taken as a whole) is least capable of doing what she desires; there is a
gadfly which goads her, and she is full of trouble and remorse?

certainly.

and is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor?

poor.

and the tyrannical soul must be always poor and insatiable?

true.

more friendless, more impious, than he was at first; he is the purveyor
and cherisher of every sort of vice, and the consequence is that he is
supremely miserable, and that he makes everybody else as miserable as
himself.

no man of any sense will dispute your words.

come then, i said, and as the general umpire in theatrical contests
proclaims the result, do you also decide who in your opinion is first
in the scale of happiness, and who second, and in what order the others
follow: there are five of them in all--they are the royal, timocratical,
oligarchical, democratical, tyrannical.

the decision will be easily given, he replied; they shall be choruses
coming on the stage, and i must judge them in the order in which they
enter, by the criterion of virtue and vice, happiness and misery.

need we hire a herald, or shall i announce, that the son of ariston (the
best) has decided that t

exactly.

and there are three kinds of pleasure, which are their several objects?

very true.

now, if you examine the three classes of men, and ask of them in turn
which of their lives is pleasantest, each will be found praising his
own and depreciating that of others: the money-maker will contrast the
vanity of honour or of learning if they bring no money with the solid
advantages of gold and silver?

true, he said.

and the lover of honour--what will be his opinion? will he not think
that the pleasure of riches is vulgar, while the pleasure of learning,
if it brings no distinction, is all smoke and nonsense to him?

very true.

and are we to suppose, i said, that the philosopher sets any value on
other pleasures in comparison with the pleasure of knowing the truth,
and in that pursuit abiding, ever learning, not so far indeed from the
heaven of pleasure? does he not call the other pleasures necessary,
under the idea that if there were no necessity for the

yes.

and ignorance and folly are inanitions of the soul?

true.

and food and wisdom are the corresponding satisfactions of either?

certainly.

and is the satisfaction derived from that which has less or from that
which has more existence the truer?

clearly, from that which has more.

what classes of things have a greater share of pure existence in your
judgment--those of which food and drink and condiments and all kinds of
sustenance are examples, or the class which contains true opinion
and knowledge and mind and all the different kinds of virtue? put
the question in this way:--which has a more pure being--that which is
concerned with the invariable, the immortal, and the true, and is of
such a nature, and is found in such natures; or that which is concerned
with and found in the variable and mortal, and is itself variable and
mortal?

far purer, he replied, is the being of that which is concerned with the
invariable.

and does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledg

aks the truth, and
the disapprover is wrong and false and ignorant?

yes, from every point of view.

come, now, and let us gently reason with the unjust, who is not
intentionally in error. 'sweet sir,' we will say to him, 'what think
you of things esteemed noble and ignoble? is not the noble that which
subjects the beast to the man, or rather to the god in man; and the
ignoble that which subjects the man to the beast?' he can hardly avoid
saying yes--can he now?

not if he has any regard for my opinion.

but, if he agree so far, we may ask him to answer another question:
'then how would a man profit if he received gold and silver on the
condition that he was to enslave the noblest part of him to the worst?
who can imagine that a man who sold his son or daughter into slavery for
money, especially if he sold them into the hands of fierce and evil men,
would be the gainer, however large might be the sum which he
received? and will any one say that he is not a miserable caitiff who

badness of flutes, while the other, confiding in him, will do what he is
told by him?

true.

the instrument is the same, but about the excellence or badness of it
the maker will only attain to a correct belief; and this he will gain
from him who knows, by talking to him and being compelled to hear what
he has to say, whereas the user will have knowledge?

true.

but will the imitator have either? will he know from use whether or no
his drawing is correct or beautiful? or will he have right opinion
from being compelled to associate with another who knows and gives him
instructions about what he should draw?

neither.

then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge about
the goodness or badness of his imitations?

i suppose not.

the imitative artist will be in a brilliant state of intelligence about
his own creations?

nay, very much the reverse.

and still he will go on imitating without knowing what makes a thing
good or bad, and may be expected therefore to imitate

or more or heavier, no longer have the mastery
over us, but give way before calculation and measure and weight?

most true.

and this, surely, must be the work of the calculating and rational
principle in the soul?

to be sure.

and when this principle measures and certifies that some things are
equal, or that some are greater or less than others, there occurs an
apparent contradiction?

true.

but were we not saying that such a contradiction is impossible--the same
faculty cannot have contrary opinions at the same time about the same
thing?

very true.

then that part of the soul which has an opinion contrary to measure is
not the same with that which has an opinion in accordance with measure?

true.

and the better part of the soul is likely to be that which trusts to
measure and calculation?

certainly.

and that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles of
the soul?

no doubt.

this was the conclusion at which i was seeking to arrive when i said
that painting or drawing,

e faculty with
which poetical imitation is concerned is good or bad.

by all means.

we may state the question thus:--imitation imitates the actions of men,
whether voluntary or involuntary, on which, as they imagine, a good or
bad result has ensued, and they rejoice or sorrow accordingly. is there
anything more?

no, there is nothing else.

but in all this variety of circumstances is the man at unity with
himself--or rather, as in the instance of sight there was confusion and
opposition in his opinions about the same things, so here also is there
not strife and inconsistency in his life? though i need hardly raise the
question again, for i remember that all this has been already admitted;
and the soul has been acknowledged by us to be full of these and ten
thousand similar oppositions occurring at the same moment?

and we were right, he said.

yes, i said, thus far we were right; but there was an omission which
must now be supplied.

what was the omission?

were we not saying that a good man

very true.

and now, glaucon, there will be no harm in further enumerating how
many and how great are the rewards which justice and the other virtues
procure to the soul from gods and men, both in life and after death.

certainly not, he said.

will you repay me, then, what you borrowed in the argument?

what did i borrow?

the assumption that the just man should appear unjust and the unjust
just: for you were of opinion that even if the true state of the case
could not possibly escape the eyes of gods and men, still this admission
ought to be made for the sake of the argument, in order that pure
justice might be weighed against pure injustice. do you remember?

i should be much to blame if i had forgotten.

then, as the cause is decided, i demand on behalf of justice that the
estimation in which she is held by gods and men and which we acknowledge
to be her due should now be restored to her by us; since she ha
