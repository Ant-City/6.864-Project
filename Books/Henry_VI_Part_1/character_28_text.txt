rdinal's hat;
    in spite of pope or dignities of church,
    here by the cheeks i'll drag thee up and down.
  winchester. gloucester, thou wilt answer this before the
    pope.
  gloucester. winchester goose! i cry 'a rope, a rope!'
    now beat them hence; why do you let them stay?
    thee i'll chase hence, thou wolf in sheep's array.
    out, tawny-coats! out, scarlet hypocrite!

         here gloucester's men beat out the cardinal's
        men; and enter in the hurly burly the mayor of
                  london and his officers

  mayor. fie, lords! that you, being supreme magistrates,
    thus contumeliously should break the peace!
  gloucester. peace, mayor! thou know'st little of my wrongs:
    here's beaufort, that regards nor god nor king,
    hath here distrain'd the tower to his use.
  winchester. here's gloucester, a foe to citizens;
    one that still motions war and never peace,
    o'ercharging your free purses with large fines;
    that seeks to overt

hrow religion,
    because he is protector of the realm,
    and would have armour here out of the tower,
    to crown himself king and suppress the prince.
  gloucester. i will not answer thee with words, but blows.
                                      [here they skirmish again]
  mayor. nought rests for me in this tumultuous strife
    but to make open proclamation.
    come, officer, as loud as e'er thou canst,
    cry.
  officer.  [cries]  all manner of men assembled here in arms
    this day against god's peace and the king's, we charge
    and command you, in his highness' name, to repair to
    your several dwelling-places; and not to wear, handle, or
    use, any sword, weapon, or dagger, henceforward, upon
    pain of death.
  gloucester. cardinal, i'll be no

 breaker of the law;
    but we shall meet and break our minds at large.
  winchester. gloucester, we'll meet to thy cost, be sure;
    thy heart-blood i will have for this day's work.
  mayor. i'll call for clubs if you will not away.
    this cardinal's more haughty than the devil.
  gloucester. mayor, farewell; thou dost but what thou
    mayst.
  winchester. abominable gloucester, guard thy head,
    for i intend to have it ere long.
                    exeunt, severally, gloucester and winchester

  mayor. see the coast clear'd, and then we will depart.

    o, what a scandal is it to our crown
    that two such noble peers as ye should jar!
    believe me, lords, my tender years can tell
    civil dissension is a viperous worm
    that gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth.
                  [a noise within: 'down with the tawny coats!']
    what tumult's this?
  warwick. an uproar, i dare warrant,
    begun through malice of the bishop's men.
                              [a noise again: 'stones! stones!']

                enter the mayor of london, attended

  mayor. o, my good lords, and virtuous henry,
    pity the city of london, pity us!
    the bishop and the duke of gloucester's men,
    forbidden late to carry any weapon,
    have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones
    and, banding themselves in contrary parts,
    do pelt so fast at one another's pate
    that many have their giddy brains knock'd out.
    our windows are broke down in every street,
    and we for fear compell'd to shut our shops.
