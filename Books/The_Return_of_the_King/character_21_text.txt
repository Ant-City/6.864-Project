you may have taken me for a soft stranger-lad and easy prey, let me warn you: i am not, i am a halfling, hard, bold, and wicked!’ pippin pulled such a grim face that the boy stepped back a pace, but at once he returned with clenched fists and the light of battle in his eye.
‘no!’ pippin laughed. ‘don’t believe what strangers say of themselves either! i am not a fighter. but it would be politer in any case for the challenger to say who he is.’
the boy drew himself up proudly. ‘i am bergil son of beregond of the guards,’ he said.
‘so i thought,’ said pippin, ‘for you look like your father. i know him and he sent me to find you.’
‘then why did you not say so at once?’ said bergil, and suddenly a look of dismay came over his face. ‘do not tell me that he has changed his mind, and will send me away with the maidens! but no, the last wains have gone.’
‘his message is less bad than that, if not good.’ said pippin. ‘he says that if you would prefer it to standin

g me on my head, you might show me round the city for a while and cheer my loneliness. i can tell you some tales of far countries in return.’
bergil clapped his hands, and laughed with relief. ‘all is well,’ he cried. ‘come then! we were soon going to the gate to look on. we will go now.’
‘what is happening there?’
‘the captains of the outlands are expected up the south road ere sundown. come with us and you will see.’
bergil proved a good comrade, the best company pippin had had since he parted from merry, and soon they were laughing and talking gaily as they went about the streets, heedless of the many glances that men gave them. before long they found themselves in a throng going towards the great gate. there pippin went up much in the esteem of bergil, for when he spoke his name and the pass-word the guard saluted him and let him pass through; and what was more, he allowed him to take his companion with him.

that is good!’ said bergil. ‘we boys are no longer allowed to pass the gate without an elder. now we shall see better.’
beyond the gate there was a crowd of men along the verge of the road and of the great paved space into which all the ways to minas tirith ran. all eyes were turned southwards, and soon a murmur rose: ‘there is dust away there! they are coming!’
pippin and bergil edged their way forward to the front of the crowd, and waited. horns sounded at some distance, and the noise of cheering rolled towards them like a gathering wind. then there was a loud trumpet-blast, and all about them people were shouting.
‘forlong! forlong!’ pippin heard men calling. ‘what do they say?’ he asked.
‘forlong has come,’ bergil answered; ‘old forlong the fat, the lord of lossarnach. that is where my grandsire lives. hurrah! here he is. good old forlong!’

n had gone behind mindolluin. shadow came down on the city.
pippin looked up, and it seemed to him that the sky had grown ashen-grey, as if a vast dust and smoke hung above them, and light came dully through it. but in the west the dying sun had set all the fume on fire, and now mindolluin stood black against a burning smoulder flecked with embers. ‘so ends a fair day in wrath!’ he said forgetful of the lad at his side.
‘so it will, if i have not returned before the sundown-bells,’ said bergil. ‘come! there goes the trumpet for the closing of the gate.’
hand in hand they went back into the city, the last to pass the gate before it was shut; and as they reached the lampwrights’ street all the bells in the towers tolled solemnly. lights sprang in many windows, and from the houses and wards of the men at arms along the walls there came the sound of song.
‘farewell for this time,’ said bergil. ‘take my greetings to my :father, and thank him for the company that he sent. come

 with fear and pity. ‘no, we are going to the houses of healing.’
they turned out of the lane that ran between tall houses and the outer wall of the fourth circle, and they regained the main street climbing up to the citadel. step by step they went, while merry swayed and murmured as one in sleep.
‘i’ll never get him there,’ thought pippin. ‘is there no one to help me? i can’t leave him here.’ just then to his surprise a boy came running up behind, and as he passed he recognized bergil beregond’s son.
‘hullo, bergil!’ he called. ‘where are you going? glad to see you again, and still alive!’
‘i am running errands for the healers,’ said bergil. ‘i cannot stay.’
‘don’t!’ said pippin. ‘but tell them up there that i have a sick hobbit, a perian mind you, come from the battle-field. i don’t think he can walk so far. if mithrandir is there, he will be glad of the message.’ bergil ran on.
‘i’d better wait here,’ thought pippin. so he let merry sink

g, go and find some old man of less lore and more wisdom who keeps some in his house!’ cried gandalf.
now aragorn knelt beside faramir, and held a hand upon his brow. and those that watched felt that some great struggle was going on. for aragorn’s face grew grey with weariness; and ever and anon he called the name of faramir, but each time more faintly to their hearing, as if aragorn himself was removed from them, and walked afar in some dark vale, calling for one that was lost.
and at last bergil came running in, and he bore six leaves in a cloth. ‘it is kingsfoil, sir,’ he said; ‘but not fresh, i fear. it must have been culled two weeks ago at the least. i hope it will serve, sir?’ then looking at faramir he burst into tears.
but aragorn smiled. ‘it will serve,’ he said. ‘the worst is now over. stay and be comforted!’ then taking two leaves, he laid them on his hands and breathed on them, and then he crushed them, and straightway a living freshness filled the room, as i

at honour. peregrin shall go and represent the shirefolk; and do not grudge him his chance of peril, for though he has done as well as his fortune allowed him, he has yet to match your deed. but in truth all now are in like danger. though it may be our part to find bitter end before the gate of mordor, if we do so, then you will come also to a last stand, either here or wherever the black tide overtakes you. farewell!’
and so despondently merry now stood and watched the mustering of the army. bergil was with him, and he also was downcast; for his father was to march leading a company of the men of the city: he could not rejoin the guard until his case was judged. in that same company pippin was also to go, as a soldier of gondor. merry could see him not far off, a small but upright figure among the tall men of minas tirith.
at last the trumpets rang and the army began to move. troop by troop, and company by company, they wheeled and went off eastward. and long after they had passed away ou

. the last glint of the morning sun on spear and helm twinkled and was lost, and still he remained with bowed head and heavy heart, feeling friendless and alone. everyone that he cared for had gone away into the gloom that hung over the distant eastern sky; and little hope at all was left in his heart that he would ever see any of them again.
as if recalled by his mood of despair, the pain in his arm returned, and he felt weak and old, and the sunlight seemed thin. he was roused by the touch of bergil’s hand.
‘come, master perian!’ said the lad. ‘you are still in pain, i see. i will help you back to the healers. but do not fear! they will come back. the men of minas tirith will never be overcome. and now they have the lord elfstone, and beregond of the guard too.’
ere noon the army came to osgiliath. there all the workers and craftsmen that could be spared were busy. some were strengthening the ferries and boat-bridges that the enemy had made and in part destroyed when they fled; s
