‘most of you, i am sure, remember the tragic circumstances of the death of geoffrey clifton at gilf kebir, followed later by 
the disappearance of his wife, katharine clifton, which took place during the 1939 desert expedition in search of zerzura. 
“i cannot begin this meeting tonight without referring very sympathetically to those tragic occurrences.

but we were interested in how our lives could mean something to the past. we sailed into the past. we were young. we 
knew power and great finance were temporary things. we all slept with herodotus. “for those cities that were great in earlier 
times must have now become small, and those that were great in my time were small in the time before.... man’s good fortune 
never abides in the same place.” 

 
in 1936 a young man named geoffrey clifton had met a friend at oxford who mentioned what we were doing. he contacted 

me, got married the next day, and two weeks later flew with his wife to cairo. 

the couple entered our world—the four of us, prince kemal el din, bell, almasy and madox. the name that still filled our 
mouths  was  gilf  kebir.  somewhere  in  the  gilf  nestled  zerzura,  whose  name  occurs  in  arab  writings  as  far  back  as  the 
thirteenth century. when you travel that far in time you need a plane, and young

when  she  was  finally  still,  just  now  and  then  a  shudder,  he  began  to  scratch  her  through  the  sari,  then  pulled  it  aside  and

i promised to tell you how one falls in love. 
a young man named geoffrey clifton had met a friend at oxford who had mentioned what we were doing. he contacted me, 
got married the next day, and two weeks later flew with his wife to cairo. they were on the last days of their honeymoon. that 
was the beginning of our story. 

 
when i met katharine she was married. a married woman. clifton climbed out of the plane and then, unexpected, for we 
had planned the expedition with just him in mind, she emerged. khaki shorts, bony knees. in those days she was too ardent for

my eye there. i would kneel while she looked down on me quizzical as if i were a planetary stranger. she of the quizzical 
look.  her  cool  hand  suddenly  against  my  neck  on  a  cairo  bus.  taking  a  closed  taxi  and  our  quick-hand  love  between  the 
khedive ismail bridge and the tipperary club. or the sun through her fingernails on the third-floor lobby at the museum when 
her hand covered my face. 

as far as we were concerned there was only one person to avoid being seen by. 
but geoffrey clifton was a man embedded in the english machine. he had a family genealogy going back to canute. the 
machine would not necessarily have revealed to clifton, married only eighteen months, his wife’s infidelity, but it began to 
encircle the fault, the disease in the system. it knew every move she and i made from the first day of the awkward touch in the 
porte cochere of the semiramis hotel. 

i had ignored her remarks about her husband’s relatives. and geoffrey clifton was as innocent as we were

but caravaggio leans forward. 
“i need to know something.” 
“what?” 
“i need to know if you murdered katharine clifton. that is, if you murdered clifton, and in so doing killed her.” 
“no. i never even imagined that.”

afraid. your friendly boy. as far as the english were concerned, he was keeping an eye on your strange group in the egyptian-
libyan desert. they knew the desert would someday be a theatre of war. he was an aerial photographer. his death perturbed 
them, still does. they still raise the question. and intelligence knew about your affair with his wife, from the beginning. even

and had filled her lap. there didn’t seem to be a mark on her. her left hand had gone forward to cushion the collapse of their

there  are  a  hundred  deities  associated  with  animals,  i  tell  her.  there  are  the  ones  linked  to  jackals—anubis,  duamutef,

the floor and you in your bare feet like some heron picking your way among them. he is watching you but i am watching you

of those outside your sphere of grace. the jackal is not used much at oxford as an escort. whereas i am the man who fasts

there are three of us in the oxford union library, but you find only geoffrey clifton. it will be a whirlwind romance. he 
has some job with archaeologists in north africa, of all places. “a strange old coot i’m working with.” your mother is quite 
delighted at your adventure. 

but the spirit of the jackal, who was the “opener of the ways,” whose name was wepwawet or almasy, stood in the room 
with the two of you. my arms folded, watching your attempts at enthusiastic small talk, a problem as you both were drunk. but 
what was wonderful was that even within the drunke
