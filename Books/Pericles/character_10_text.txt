tilting.]

simonides.
knights,
to say you're welcome were superfluous.
to place upon the volume of your deeds,
as in a title-page, your worth in arms,
were more than you expect, or more than's fit,
since every worth in show commends itself.
prepare for mirth, for mirth becomes a feast:
you are princes and my guests.

thaisa.
but you, my knight and guest;
to whom this wreath of victory i give,
and crown you king of this day's happiness.

contend not, sir; for we are gentlemen
that neither in our hearts nor outward eyes
envy the great nor do the low despise.

pericles.
you are right courteous knights.

simonides.
sit, sir, sit.

pericles.
by jove, i wonder, that is king of thoughts,
these cates resist me, she but thought upon.

thaisa.
by juno, that is queen of marriage,
all viands that i eat do seem unsavoury,
wishing him my meat. sure, he's a gallant gentleman.

simonides.
he's but a country gentleman;
has done no more than other knights have done;
has broken a staff or so; so let it pass.

thaisa.
to me he seems like diamond to glass.

pericles.
yon king's to me like to my father's picture,
which tells me in that glory once he was;
had princes sit, like stars, about his throne,
and he the sun, for them to

simonides.

as you do love, fill to your mistress' lips, --
we drink this health to you.

knights.
we thank your grace.

simonides.
yet pause awhile:
yon knight doth sit too melancholy,
as if the entertainment in our court
had not a show might countervail his worth.
note it not you, thaisa?

thaisa.
what is it
to me, my father?

simonides.
o attend, my daughter:
princes in this should live like god's above,
who freely give to every one that comes
to honour them:
and princes not doing so are like to gnats,
which make a sound, but kill'd are wonder'd at.
therefore to make his entrance more sweet,
here, say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him.

thaisa.
alas, my father, it befits not me
unto a stranger knight to be so bold:

and furthermore tell him, we desire to know of him,
of whence he is, his name and parentage.

thaisa.

pericles.
i thank him.

thaisa.

pericles.
i thank both him and you, and pledge him freely.

thaisa.
and further he desires to know of you,
of whence you are, your name and parentage.

pericles.
a gentleman of tyre; my name, pericles;
my education been in arts and arms;
who, looking for adventures in the world,
was by the rough seas reft of ships and men,
and after shipwreck driven upon this shore.

thaisa.
he thanks your grace; names himself pericles,
a gentleman of tyre,
who only by misfortune of the seas
bereft of ships and men, cast on this shore.

simonides. [aside.]
now, by the gods, i do applaud his courage.

pericles.
my actions are  as noble as my thoughts,
that never relish'd of a base descent.
i came unto your court for honour's cause,
and not to be a rebel to her state;
and he that otherwise accounts of me,
this sword shall prove he's honour's enemy.

simonides.
no?
here comes my daughter, she can witness it.

[enter thaisa.]

pericles.
then, as you are as virtuous as fair,
resolve your angry father, if my tongue
did e'er solicit, or my hand subscribe
to any syllable that made love to you.

thaisa.
why, sir, say if you had,
who takes offence at that would make me glad?

simonides.
yea, mistress, are you so peremptory?
[aside.]
i am glad on't with all my heart. --
i'll tame you; i'll bring you in subjection.
will you, not having my consent,
bestow your love and your affections
upon a stranger?

therefore hear you, mistress; either frame

either be ruled by me, or i will make you --
man and wife:
nay, come, your hands and lips must seal it too:
and being join'd, i'll thus your hopes destroy;
and for a further grief, -- god give you joy! --
what, are you both pleased?

thaisa.
yes, if you love me, sir.

pericles.
even as my life my blood that fosters it.

simonides.
what, are you both agreed?

both.
yes, if it please your majesty.

it pleaseth me so well, that i will see you wed;
and then with what haste you can get you to bed.
