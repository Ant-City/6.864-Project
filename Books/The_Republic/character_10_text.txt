ter and reputation; in the hope of
obtaining for him who is reputed just some of those offices, marriages,
and the like which glaucon has enumerated among the advantages accruing
to the unjust from the reputation of justice. more, however, is made of
appearances by this class of persons than by the others; for they
throw in the good opinion of the gods, and will tell you of a shower of
benefits which the heavens, as they say, rain upon the pious; and this
accords with the testimony of the noble hesiod and homer, the first of
whom says, that the gods make the oaks of the just--

   'to bear acorns at their summit, and bees in the middle;
   and the sheep are bowed down with the weight of their fleeces,'

and many other blessings of a like kind are provided for them. and homer
has a very similar strain; for he speaks of one whose fame is--

'as the fame of some blameless king who, like a god, maintains justice;
to whom the black earth brings forth wheat and barley, whose trees are
bowed with f

d. and mendicant prophets go to
rich men's doors and persuade them that they have a power committed
to them by the gods of making an atonement for a man's own or his
ancestor's sins by sacrifices or charms, with rejoicings and feasts; and
they promise to harm an enemy, whether just or unjust, at a small cost;
with magic arts and incantations binding heaven, as they say, to execute
their will. and the poets are the authorities to whom they appeal, now
smoothing the path of vice with the words of hesiod;--

'vice may be had in abundance without trouble; the way is smooth and her
dwelling-place is near. but before virtue the gods have set toil,'

and a tedious and uphill road: then citing homer as a witness that the
gods may be influenced by men; for he also says:--

'the gods, too, may be turned from their purpose; and men pray to them
and avert their wrath by sacrifices and soothing entreaties, and by
libations and the odour of fat, when they have sinned and transgressed.'

tales, even more fondly than they mould the body with their hands; but
most of those which are now in use must be discarded.

of what tales are you speaking? he said.

you may find a model of the lesser in the greater, i said; for they are
necessarily of the same type, and there is the same spirit in both of
them.

very likely, he replied; but i do not as yet know what you would term
the greater.

those, i said, which are narrated by homer and hesiod, and the rest of
the poets, who have ever been the great story-tellers of mankind.

but which stories do you mean, he said; and what fault do you find with
them?

a fault which is most serious, i said; the fault of telling a lie, and,
what is more, a bad lie.

but when is this fault committed?

whenever an erroneous representation is made of the nature of gods and
heroes,--as when a painter paints a portrait not having the shadow of a
likeness to the original.

yes, he said, that sort of thing

is certainly very blameable; but what
are the stories which you mean?

first of all, i said, there was that greatest of all lies in high
places, which the poet told about uranus, and which was a bad lie
too,--i mean what hesiod says that uranus did, and how cronus retaliated
on him. the doings of cronus, and the sufferings which in turn his son
inflicted upon him, even if they were true, ought certainly not to be
lightly told to young and thoughtless persons; if possible, they had
better be buried in silence. but if there is an absolute necessity
for their mention, a chosen few might hear them in a mystery, and
they should sacrifice not a common (eleusinian) pig, but some huge and
unprocurable victim; and then the num

andmen, to be compared with
it?

certainly not.

at the same time i ought here to repeat what i have said elsewhere, that
if any of our guardians shall try to be happy in such a manner that
he will cease to be a guardian, and is not content with this safe and
harmonious life, which, in our judgment, is of all lives the best, but
infatuated by some youthful conceit of happiness which gets up into his
head shall seek to appropriate the whole state to himself, then he will
have to learn how wisely hesiod spoke, when he said, 'half is more than
the whole.'

if he were to consult me, i should say to him: stay where you are, when
you have the offer of such a life.

you agree then, i said, that men and women are to have a common way of
life such as we have described--common education, common children; and
they are to watch over the citizens in common whether abiding in the
city or going out to war; they are to keep watch together, and to hunt
together like dogs; and always and in all things, as far

he like occasions, will honour the brave according to
the measure of their valour, whether men or women, with hymns and those
other distinctions which we were mentioning; also with

'seats of precedence, and meats and full cups;'

and in honouring them, we shall be at the same time training them.

that, he replied, is excellent.

yes, i said; and when a man dies gloriously in war shall we not say, in
the first place, that he is of the golden race?

to be sure.

nay, have we not the authority of hesiod for affirming that when they
are dead

'they are holy angels upon the earth, authors of good, averters of evil,
the guardians of speech-gifted men'?

yes; and we accept his authority.

we must learn of the god how we are to order the sepulture of divine and
heroic personages, and what is to be their special distinction; and we
must do as he bids?

by all means.

and in ages to come we will reverence them and kneel before their
sepulchres as at the graves of heroes. and not only they but any who

of them will be appointed by their
predecessors, still they will be unworthy to hold their fathers' places,
and when they come into power as guardians, they will soon be found
to fail in taking care of us, the muses, first by under-valuing music;
which neglect will soon extend to gymnastic; and hence the young men of
your state will be less cultivated. in the succeeding generation rulers
will be appointed who have lost the guardian power of testing the metal
of your different races, which, like hesiod's, are of gold and silver
and brass and iron. and so iron will be mingled with silver, and brass
with gold, and hence there will arise dissimilarity and inequality and
irregularity, which always and in all places are causes of hatred
and war. this the muses affirm to be the stock from which discord has
sprung, wherever arising; and this is their answer to us.

yes, and we may assume that they answer truly.

why, yes, i said, of course they answer truly; how can the muses speak
falsely?

wers, and been honoured and
loved by them? protagoras of abdera, and prodicus of ceos, and a host of
others, have only to whisper to their contemporaries: 'you will never be
able to manage either your own house or your own state until you appoint
us to be your ministers of education'--and this ingenious device of
theirs has such an effect in making men love them that their companions
all but carry them about on their shoulders. and is it conceivable that
the contemporaries of homer, or again of hesiod, would have allowed
either of them to go about as rhapsodists, if they had really been able
to make mankind virtuous? would they not have been as unwilling to part
with them as with gold, and have compelled them to stay at home with
them? or, if the master would not stay, then the disciples would have
followed him about everywhere, until they had got education enough?

yes, socrates, that, i think, is quite true.

then must we not infer that all these poetical individuals, beginning

whether she have one shape only or many, or what her nature is. of her
affections and of the forms which she takes in this present life i think
that we have now said enough.

true, he replied.

and thus, i said, we have fulfilled the conditions of the argument; we
have not introduced the rewards and glories of justice, which, as you
were saying, are to be found in homer and hesiod; but justice in her own
nature has been shown to be best for the soul in her own nature. let a
man do what is just, whether he have the ring of gyges or not, and even
if in addition to the ring of gyges he put on the helmet of hades.

very true.

and now, glaucon, there will be no harm in further enumerating how
many and how great are the rewards which justice and the other virtues
procure to the soul from gods and men, both in life and after death.

certainly not, he said.
