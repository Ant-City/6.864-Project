ects  into  them;  by  stretching,  twisting,  or  crushing  them;  or  by  freezing,  heating,  or
burning them. during the past hundred years physicists have accumulated mounting evidence that all
of  these  interactions  between  various  objects  and  materials,  as  well  as  any  of  the  millions  upon
millions of others encountered daily, can be reduced to combinations of four fundamental forces. one
of these is the gravitational force. the other three are the electromagnetic force, the weak force, and
the strong force.

gravity is the most familiar of the forces, being responsible for keeping us in orbit around the
sun as well as for keeping our feet firmly planted on earth. the mass of an object measures how much
gravitational force it can exert as well as feel. the electromagnetic force is the next most familiar of
the  four.  it  is  the  force  driving  all  of  the  conveniences  of  modern  life—lights,  computers,  tvs,
telephones—and  underlies  the  awesome  might  of  ligh

tning  storms  and  the  gentle  touch  of  a  human
hand. microscopically, the electric charge of a particle plays the same role for the electromagnetic
force as mass does for gravity: it determines how strongly the particle can exert as well as respond
electromagnetically.

the strong and the weak forces are less familiar because their strength rapidly diminishes over
all  but  subatomic  distance  scales;  they  are  the  nuclear  forces.  this  is  why  these  two  forces  were
discovered  only  much  more  recently.  the  strong  force  is  responsible  for  keeping  quarks  "glued"
together inside of protons and neutrons and keeping protons and neutrons tightly crammed together
inside atomic nuclei. the weak force is best known as the force responsible for the radioactive decay

ists believe that the gravitational force
also  has  an  associated  particle—the  graviton—but  its  existence  has  yet  to  be  confirmed
experimentally.

the second common feature of the forces is that just as mass determines how gravity affects a
particle,  and  electric  charge  determines  how  the  electromagnetic  force  affects  it,  particles  are
endowed  with  certain  amounts  of  "strong  charge"  and  "weak  charge"  that  determine  how  they  are
affected by the strong and weak forces. (these properties are detailed in the table in the endnotes to
this chapter.1) but as with particle masses, beyond the fact that experimental physicists have carefully
measured  these  properties,  no  one  has  any  explanation  of why  our  universe  is  composed  of  these
particular particles, with these particular masses and force charges.

nalogous cancellations—more stuff means greater gravitational force. but fundamentally
speaking, gravity is an extremely feeble force. (this fact accounts for the difficulty in experimentally
confirming  the  existence  of  the  graviton.  searching  for  the  smallest  bundle  of  the  feeblest  force  is
quite a challenge.) experiments also have shown that the strong force is about one hundred times as
strong as the electromagnetic force and about one hundred thousand times as strong as the weak force.
but where is the rationale—the raison d'être—for our universe having these features?

this is not a question born of idle philosophizing about why certain details happen to be one
way instead of another; the universe would be a vastly different place if the properties of the matter
and force particles were even moderately changed. for example, the existence of the stable nuclei
forming the hundred or so elements of the periodic table hinges delicately on the ratio between the

an  indisputable  macroscopic  presence.  nevertheless,  glashow,  salam,  and  weinberg  showed,  in
essence, that at high enough energy and temperature—such as occurred a mere fraction of a second
after  the  big  bang—electromagnetic  and  weak  force  fields dissolve  into  one  another,  take  on
indistinguishable  characteristics,  and  are  more  accurately  called electroweak  fields.  when  the
temperature drops, as it has done steadily since the big bang, the electromagnetic and weak forces
crystallize out in a different manner from their common high-temperature form—through a process
known as symmetry breaking that we will describe later—and therefore appear to be distinct in the
cold universe we currently inhabit.

and  so,  if  you  are  keeping  score,  by  the  1970s  physicists  had  developed  a  sensible  and
successful quantum-mechanical description of three of the four forces (strong, weak, electromagnetic)
and had shown that two of the three (weak and electromagnet

ic) actually share a common origin (the
electroweak force). during the past two decades, physicists have subjected this quantum-mechanical
treatment of the three nongravitational forces—as they act among themselves and the matter particles
introduced  in  chapter  1—to  an  enormous  amount  of  experimental  scrutiny.  the  theory  has  met  all
such challenges with aplomb. once experimentalists measure some 19 parameters (the masses of the

technological limit. for this reason, physicists call the theory of the three nongravitational forces and
the  three  families  of  matter  particles  the  standard  theory,  or  (more  often)  the standard  model  of
particle physics.

messenger particles

according to the standard model, just as the photon is the smallest constituent of an electromagnetic
field, the strong and the weak force fields have smallest constituents as well. as we discussed briefly
in chapter 1, the smallest bundles of the strong force are known as gluons, and those of the weak
force are known as weak gauge bosons (or more precisely, the w and z bosons). the standard model
instructs us to think of these force particles as having no internal structure—in this framework they
are every bit as elementary as the particles in the three families of matter.

r forces is the huge range in their intrinsic
strengths. the electromagnetic force has less than 1 percent of the strength of the strong force, the
weak  force  is  some  thousand  times  feebler  than  that,  and  the  gravitational  force  is  some  hundred
million billion billion billion (10-35) times weaker still. following the pathbreaking and ultimately
nobel  prize–winning  work  of  glashow,  salam,  and  weinberg  that  established  a  deep  connection
between the electromagnetic and weak forces (discussed in chapter 5), in 1974 glashow, together

with his harvard colleague howard georgi, suggested that an analogous connection might be forged
with the strong force. their work, which proposed a "grand unification" of three of the four forces,
differed in one essential way from that of the electroweak theory: whereas the electromagnetic and
weak forces crystallized out of a more symmetric union when the temperature of the universe dropped
to about a million billion degrees above absolu

drive the strength of the electromagnetic force to get larger when examined on shorter distance scales.
what about the other forces of the standard model? how do their intrinsic strengths vary with
distance?  in  1973,  gross  and  frank  wilczek  at  princeton,  and,  independently,  david  politzer  at
harvard,  studied  this  question  and  found  a  surprising  answer:  the  quantum  cloud  of  particle
eruptions and annihilations amplifies the strengths of the strong and weak forces. this implies that as
we examine them on shorter distances, we penetrate more of this seething cloud and hence are subject
to less of its amplification. and so, the strengths of these forces get weaker when they are probed on
shorter distances.

georgi,  quinn,  and  weinberg  took  this  realization  and  ran  with  it  to  a  remarkable  end.  they
showed that when these effects of the quantum frenzy are carefully accounted for, the net result is that

theories encompassing gravity, extra dimensions, and supersymmetry.

as  had  been  the  case  with  kaluza's  original  attempt,  various  versions  of  higher-dimensional
supergravity looked quite promising at first. the new equations resulting from the extra dimensions
were strikingly reminiscent of those used in the description of electromagnetism, and the strong and
the weak forces. but detailed scrutiny showed that the old conundrums persisted. most importantly,
the pernicious short-distance quantum undulations of space were lessened by supersymmetry, but not
sufficiently  to  yield  a  sensible  theory.  physicists  also  found  it  difficult  to  find  a  single,  sensible,
higher-dimensional theory incorporating all features of forces and matter.7

approximate  equations  that  string  theorists  currently  use  are  not  powerful  enough  to  work  out  the
resulting physics fully for any given choice of calabi-yau shape. they can take us a long way toward
understanding, in the sense of a ballpark estimate, the properties of the string vibrations that we hope
will align with the particles we observe. but precise and definitive physical conclusions, such as the
mass of the electron or the strength of the weak force, require equations that are far more exact than
the present approximate framework. recall from chapter 6—and the price is right  example—that
the  "natural"  energy  scale  of  string  theory  is  the  planck  energy,  and  it  is  only  through  extremely

shows  that  not  all  of  the  high-temperature  symmetry  was  erased:  the  weak  and  electromagnetic

6. one subtle point to note about figure 7.1 is that the strength of the weak force is shown to be
between  that  of  the  strong  and  electromagnetic  forces,  whereas  we  have  previously  said  that  it  is
weaker than both. the reason for this lies in table 1.2, in which we see that the messenger particles
of  the  weak  force  are  quite  massive,  whereas  those  of  the  strong  and  electromagnetic  forces  are
massless. intrinsically, the strength of the weak force (as measured by its coupling constant—an idea
we will come upon in chapter 12) is as shown in figure

challenge you can meet? in the mid-1950s, the theoretical insights of t. d. lee and c. n. yang, and
the experimental results of c. s. wu and collaborators, showed that you can meet the challenge, so
long as an appropriate experiment had been filmed. namely, their work established that the laws of
the  universe  are  not  perfectly  mirror  symmetric  in  the  sense  that  the  mirror-reflected  version  of
certain processes—those directly dependent on the weak force—cannot happen in our world, even
though  the  original  process  can. and  so,  as  you  watch  the  film  if  you  see  one  of  these  forbidden
processes occur, you will know that you are watching a mirror-reflected image of the experiment, as
opposed to the experiment itself. since mirrors interchange left and right, the work of lee, yang, and
wu established that the universe is not perfectly left-right symmetric—in the language of the field, the
universe  is chiral.  it  is  this  feat
