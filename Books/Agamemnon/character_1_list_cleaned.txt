[CHARACTER] - 
      the play's protagonist, [CHARACTER] is agamemnon's wife and has ruled argos in his absence. she plans his murder with ruthless determination, and feels no guilt after his death; she is convinced of her own rectitude and of the justice of killing the man who killed her daughter. she is, a sympathetic character in many respects, but the righteousness of her crime is tainted by her entanglement with aegisthus. even so, aeschylus makes it clear that agamemnon's death must be avenged.
