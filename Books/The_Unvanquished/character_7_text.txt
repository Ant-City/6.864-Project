, eating breakfast. their uniforms were
not gray anymore now; they were almost the color of dead leaves and some of them
didn't even have uniforms and one man waved a skillet at us and he had on a pair of blue
yankee pants with a yellow cavalry stripe like father wore home last summer. "hey,
missippi!" he shouted. "hooraw for arkansaw!"

drive out home now and then and look after the flowers. then ringo and i drove the
wagon on to the store and we were just coming out with the sack of salt when uncle buck
mccaslin came hobbling across the square, waving his stick and hollering, and behind him
the captain of the company we had passed eating breakfast in the pasture. there were
two of them; i mean, there were two mccaslins, amodeus and theophilus, twins, only
everybody called them buck and buddy except themselves. they were bachelors, they
had a big bottom-land plantation about fifteen miles from town. it had a big colonial
house on it which their father had built and which people said was still o

houses in the country when they inherited it. but it wasn't now, because uncle buck and
buddy didn't live in it. they never had lived in it since their father died. they lived in a two-
room log house with about a dozen dogs, and they kept their niggers in the manor house.
it didn't have any windows now and a child with a hairpin could unlock any lock in it, but
every night when the niggers came up from the fields uncle buck or uncle buddy would
drive them into the house and lock the door with a key almost as big as a horse pistol;
probably they would still be locking the front door long after the last nigger had escaped
out the back. and folks said that uncle buck and uncle buddy knew this and that the
niggers knew they knew it, only it was like a game with rules--neither one of uncle buck or
uncle buddy to peep around the corner of the house while the other was locking the door,
none of the niggers to escape in s

their own little house full of dogs and eat supper and play head-and-head poker; and

but that people belonged to land and that the earth would permit them to live on and
out of it and use it only so long as they behaved and that if they did not behave right, it
would shake them off just like a dog getting rid of fleas. they had some kind of a system of
bookkeeping which must have been even more involved than their betting score against
one another, by which all their niggers were to be freed, not given freedom, but earning it,
buying it not in money from uncle buck and buddy, but in work from the plantation. only
there were others besides niggers, and this was the reason why uncle buck came hobbling
across the square, shaking his stick at me and hollering, or at least why it was uncle buck
who was hobbling and hollering and shaking the stick. one day father said how they
suddenly realized that if the county ever split up into private feuds either with votes or
weapons, no family could contend with the mccaslins because all the other families
would have on

ly their cousins and kin to recruit from, while uncle buck and buddy would
already have an army. these were the dirt farmers, the people whom the niggers called
'white trash'--men who had owned no slaves and some of whom even lived worse than
the slaves on big plantations. it was another side of uncle buck's and buddy's ideas about
men and land, which father said people didn't have a name for yet, by which uncle buck
and buddy had persuaded the white men to pool their little patches of poor hill land along
with the niggers and the mccaslin plantation, promising them in return nobody knew
exactly what, except that their women and children did have shoes, which not all of them
had had before, and a lot of them even went to school. anyway, they (the white men, the
trash) looked on uncle buck and buddy like deity himself, so that when father began to
raise his first regiment to take to virginia and uncle buck a

and the others decided they were too old (they were past seventy), it looked for a while as
if father's regiment would have to fight its first engagement right there in our pasture. at
first uncle buck and buddy said they would form a company of their own men in
opposition to father's. then they realized that this wouldn't stop father, so then uncle buck
and buddy put the thumbscrews on father sure enough. they told father that if he did not
let them go, the solid bloc of private soldier white trash votes which they controlled would
not only force father to call a special election of officers before the regiment left the
pasture, it would also demote father from colonel to major or maybe only a company
commander. father didn't mind what they called him; colonel or corporal, it would have
been all the same to him, as long as they let him tell th

em what to do, and he probably
wouldn't have minded being demoted even to private by god himself; it was the idea
that there could be latent within the men he led the power, let alone the desire, to so
affront him. so they compromised; they agreed at last that one of the mccaslins should be
allowed to go. father and uncle buck and buddy shook hands on it and they stuck to it;

father said it was fine, that there were people there who had never seen anything

the following summer after second manassas when the men did demote father, it was the
mccaslin votes who stuck with and resigned from the regiment along with father and
returned to mississippi with him and formed his irregular cavalry. so one of them was to go,
and they decided themselves which one it would be; they decided in the one possible

like it for cold and ruthless artistry. they played three hands of draw poker, the first two
hands dealt in turn, the winner of the second hand to deal the third; they sat there
(somebody had spread a blanket and the whole regiment watched) facing each other
with the two old faces that did not look exactly alike so much as they looked exactly like

dead a long time and that you knew just by looking at him he had been a preacher in
some place like massachusetts a hundred years ago; they sat there and called those
face-down cards correctly without even looking at the backs of them apparently, so that
it took sometimes eight and ten deals before the referees could be certain that neither of
them knew exactly what was in the other's hand. and uncle buck lost: so that now uncle
buddy was a sergeant in tennant's brigade in virginia and uncle buck was hobbling across
the square, shaking his stick at me and hollering:
"by godfrey, there he is! there's john sartoris' boy!"

the captain came up and looked at me. "i've heard of your father," he said.


"heard of him?" uncle buck shouted. by now people had begun to stop along the
walk and listen to him, like they always did, not smiling so he could see it. "who ain't heard

the eyes of an old hawk, with the people along the street listening to him and smiling
where he couldn't see it and the strange captain looking at him a little funny because he
hadn't heard uncle buck before; and i kept on thinking about louvinia standing there on
the porch with father's old hat on, and wishing that uncle buck would get through or hush
so we could go on.

"fools, i say!" he shouted. "i don't care if some of you folks here do still claim kin with

having to draw a breath: "leaving? hell's skillet, who's going to take care of them around

and the town men with umbrellas getting out of his way; then ringo and i stood there and
watched granny going down into the earth with the quiet rain splashing on the yellow
boards until they quit looking like boards and began to look like water with thin sunlight
reflected in it, sinking away into the ground. then the wet red dirt began to flow into the
grave, with the shovels darting and flicking slow and steady and the hill men waiting to
take turns with the shovels because uncle buck would not let anyone spell him with his.

it didn't take long, and i reckon the refugeeing preacher would have tried again
even then, but brother fortinbride didn't give him a chance. brother fortinbride didn't even
put down his shovel; he stood there leaning on it like he was in the field, and he sounded

to hit somebody with it and he didn't much care who.

before it would be smooth and quiet and level with the other earth. now uncle buck was
talking at ringo, and not hollering now. "catch my mule," he said. "i got the pistol in my

february, until one night we realised that we had been hearing geese and ducks going
north for some time. at first ringo kept a pine stick and each night he would cut a notch in
it, with a big one for sunday and two long ones which meant christmas and new year's.
but one night when the stick had almost forty notches in it, we stopped in the rain to make
camp without any roof to get under and we had to use the stick to start a fire, because of
uncle buck's arm. and so, when we came to where we could get another pine stick, we
couldn't remember whether it had been five or six or ten days, and so ringo didn't start
another. because he said he would fix the stick up the day we got grumby and that it
wouldn't need but two notches on it--one for the day we got him and one for the day

uncle buck told them that we didn't need any help; that three was enough to catch

ringo and me still unconscious in the stable with even his shirt cut to pieces like they had
had a wire snapper on the whip, and a woman with a little thread of blood still running out
of her mouth and her voice sounding light and far away like a locust from across the

but it wasn't far. you could have put a silver dollar down on the
geography page with the center of it at jefferson and we would have never ridden out
from under it. and we were closer behind them than we knew, because one night we had
ridden late without coming to a house or a shed to camp in, and so we stopped and
ringo said he would scout around a little, because all we had left to eat was the bone of
a ham; only it was more likely ringo was trying to dodge helping to get in the firewood. so
uncle buck and i were spreading down pine branches to sleep on when we heard a shot
and then a sound like a brick chimney falling onto a rotten shingle roof, and then the
horses, starting fast and dying away, and then i could hear ringo yelling. he had come
onto a house; he thought it was deserted, and then he said it looked too dark, too quiet.
so he climbed onto a shed against the back wall, and he said he saw the crack of light

room with a candle stuck into a bottle and either three or

another man jerked out a pistol and one of the others grabbed his arm as it went off, and
then the whole shed gave way under him, and he said how he lay there hollering and
trying to get untangled from the broken planks and heard them ride away.

they were not hard to follow. one day we had about twenty notches on the stick

"so he didn't shoot at you," uncle buck said. "hit warn't none of his fault if he never,"

"i have just ridden out from memphis," he said. "how far do you call it to alabama?"
uncle buck told him, not moving either, with the sparerib still raised in his left hand

"sho, now," uncle buck said. "so you look to find him in alabama?"

won't lose any distance," he said. "they are flesh and blood, the same as we are. and we
ain't scared."

so we went on at daylight, following the hoofprints now. then we had three more
notches in the stick; that night ringo put the last notch in it that he was going to, but we
didn't know it. we were sitting in front of a cotton pen where we were going to sleep,

and his beard. "ab snopes," he said. "i don't believe i am acquainted with ab snopes. but i

"not exactly," uncle buck said. "you see, we done got a little alabama grumby
evidence ourselves. that something or somebody has give grumby a change of heart
about killing women and children." he and the stranger looked at each other. "maybe it's
the wrong season for women and children. or maybe it's public opinion, now that grumby
is what you might call a public character. folks hereabouts is got used to having their
menfolks killed and even shot from behind. but even the yankees never got them used to
the other. and

said. "take a stranger's advice and stick to him."

that i saw the spurred mare jump before i saw the pistol flash; and then the mare was
galloping and uncle buck was lying on the ground cussing and yelling and dragging at his
pistol, and then all three of us were dragging and fighting over it, but the front sight was
caught in his suspenders, and the three of us fighting over it, and uncle buck panting and
cussing, and the sound of the galloping mare dying away.

him sick yet; he hadn't given us time to realise it. so we hurried on, riding along beside a
slough, and then ringo saw the snake. it had been warm for a week, until last night. but
last night it made ice, and now we saw the moccasin where it had crawled out and was
trying to get back into the water when the cold got it, so that it lay with its body on the
land and its head fixed in the skim ice like it was set into a mirror, and uncle buck turned
sideways on his mule, hollering at us: "there it is, by godfrey! there's the sign! didn't i tell you
we would--"

his pistol out now before he turned from the road and into the trees, with the stick jammed
under his hurt arm and his beard flying back over his shoulder. but we didn't find anything.

it was like we might have stopped and built a fire and thawed out that moccasin--
just enough for it to find out where it was, but not enough for it to know what to do about
it. only i reckon it was a high compliment to set ab snopes up with a moccasin, even a

to us without mercy, and that if he tried to save himself from us at their expense, they
would come back and kill him. i reckon he decided that the worst thing that could
happen to him would be for us not to do anything to him at all. because he quit jerking his
arms; he even quit lying; for a minute his eyes and his mouth were telling the same thing.

"i made a mistake," he said. "i admit hit. i reckon everybody does. the question is,
what are you fellows going to do about hit?"

"yes," uncle buck said. "everybody makes mistakes. your trouble is, you make too
many. because mistakes are bad. look at rosa millard. she just made one, and look at
her. and you have made two."

"stand still," uncle buck said. "ain't no three on you. i don't see nobody on you but

then i couldn't see him, and i couldn't seem to find him any more, not even with the
hollering; and then i was fighting three or four for a long time before uncle buck and ringo
held me, and then i could see him again, lying on the ground with his arms over his face.

to the sapling and ringo had taken off his and uncle buck's and ab snopes' galluses and
knotted them together with the bridle reins from the mules. he just hung there in the rope,
not even flinching when the lash fell, saying, "that's hit. whup me. lay hit on me; you got

ause--that was the night it began to rain
and we had to burn ringo's stick because uncle buck admitted now that his arm was
getting bad--we all ate supper together, and it was ab snopes that was the most anxious
about uncle buck, saying how it wasn't any hard feelings and that he could see himself
that he had made a mistake in trusting the folks he did, and that all he wanted to do now
was to go back home, because it was only the folks you had known all your life that you
could trust, and when you put faith in a stranger you deserved what you got when you
found that what you had been eating and sleeping with was no better than a passel of
rattlesnakes. but as soon as uncle buck tried to find out if it actually was crum

they left us early the next morning. uncle buck was sick by then; we offered to ride

back home with him, or to let ringo ride back with him, and i would keep ab snopes with
me, but uncle buck wouldn't have it.

you would lose time burying him," uncle buck said. "you boys go on. it ain't going to be
long now. and catch them!" he begun to holler, with his face flushed and his eyes bright,
taking the pistol from around his neck and giving it to me, "catch them! catch them!"

so ringo and i went on. it rained all that day; now it began to rain all the time. we had
the two mules apiece; we went fast. it rained; sometimes we had no fire at all; that was
when we lost count of time, because one morning we came to a fire still burning and a

had not even had time to butcher; and sometimes we would ride all night,
swapping mules when we had guessed that it had been two hours; and so, sometimes it
would be night when we slept and sometimes it would be daylight, and we knew that they
must have watched us from somewhere every day and that now that uncle buck was not
with us, they didn't even dare to stop and try to hide.

he whirled the mare. bridger whirled too. as they did so, grumby leaped and
caught the pistol from the ground and ran forward, crouching and shouting into the
bushes, cursing. he shot three times toward the fading sound of the horses, then he whirled
back to face us. ringo and i were on the ground, too; i don't remember when we got
down nor why, but we were down, and i remember how i looked once at ringo's face
and then how i stood there with uncle buck's pistol feeling heavy as a firedog in my hand.
then i saw that he had quit whirling; that he was standing there with the pistol hanging
against his right leg and that he was looking at me; and then all of a sudden he was
smiling.

bowden fool me into emptying my pistol at him."

and i could hear my voice; it sounded faint and far away, like the woman's in
alabama that day, so that i wondered if he could hear me: "you shot three times. you
have got two more shots in it."

but the smile was gone

s. but it didn't
take very long to ride home because we went fast with the two mounts apiece to change
to, and what we had to carry now, wrapped in a piece of the skirt of grumby's coat, didn't
weigh anything.

rode past the brick piles and the sooty walls that hadn't fallen down yet, and went on
through what used to be the square. we hitched the mules in the cedars and ringo was
just starting off to find a board when we saw that somebody had already put one up--mrs.
compson, i reckon, or maybe uncle buck when he got back home. we already had the
piece of wire.

granny had not wanted to be dead either but now she had begun to be reconciled. we
unwrapped it from the jagged square of stained faded gray cloth and fastened it to the
board. "now she can lay good and quiet," ringo said.

we had ridden a lot, and during the last week we hadn't slept much and we hadn't
always had anything to eat.

"yes," i said. "let's go home. i reckon louvinia is worried about us."

"what?" i said. "father? father's home? father?"
"and miss drusilla!" louvinia hollered, crying and praying and pawing at me, and

so it was good and dark when we came to the cabin. and then we saw that it was

lighted like for christmas; we could see the big fire and the lamp, clean and bright, when
louvinia opened the door long before we had got to it and ran out into the rain and
began to paw at me, crying and hollering.

had come home about a week ago and uncle buck told father where ringo and i were,
and how father had tried to make drusilla wait at home, but she refused, and how they
were looking for us, with uncle buck to show the way.

one motion, with louvinia's face hanging over us and still scolding, and joby in the
chimney corner where louvinia had made him get up out of granny's chair. and then
somebody was pulling at me, and i thought i was fighting ab snopes again, and then it
was the rain in father's beard and clothes that i smelled. but uncle buck was still hollering,
and father holding me, and ringo and i

held to him, and then it was drusilla kneeling and
holding me and ringo, and we could smell the rain in her hair, too, while she was hollering
at uncle buck to hush. father's hand was hard; i could see his face beyond drusilla and i
was trying to say, "father, father," while she was holding me and ringo with the rain smell
of her hair all around us, and uncle buck hollering and joby looking at uncle buck with his
mouth open and his eyes round.

"yes, by godfrey! not only tracked him down and caught him but brought back
the actual proof of it to where rosa millard could rest quiet." "the which?" joby hollered.
"fotch back the which?" "hush! hush!" drusilla said. "that's all done, all finished. you, uncle
buck!"

and drusilla rode up to that old compress, the first thing we see was that murdering
scoundrel pegged out on the door to it like a coon hide, all except the right hand. 'and if

two cross-ties ahead of the sheriff as aunt jenny said. so we walked in the dusk, slowly
between aunt jenny's flower beds while drusilla (in a dress now, who still would have worn
pants all the time if father had let her) leaned lightly on my arm and i smelled the verbena
in her hair as i had smelled the rain in it and in father's beard that night four years ago

nature or whoever it was had supplied us with for the time being, who had had to perform
more than should be required of children because there should be some limit to the age,

night when he returned and i watched him clean the derringer and reload it and we

en father realised that one of them would have to get
out. so (they were not speaking then; it was arranged by judge benbow) they met and
agreed to buy or sell, naming a price which, in reference to what they had put into it, was
ridiculously low but which each believed the other could not raise--at least father claimed
that redmond did not believe he could raise it. so redmond accepted the price, and
found out that father had the money. and according to father, that's what started it,
although uncle buck mccaslin said father could not have owned a half interest in even
one hog, let alone a railroad, and not dissolve the business either sworn enemy or death-
pledged friend to his recent partner. so they parted and father finished the road. by that
time, seeing that he was going to finish it, some northern people sold him a locomotive on
credit which he named for aunt jenny, with a silver oil can in the cab with her name
engraved on it; and last summer the first train ran into jefferson, the engi
