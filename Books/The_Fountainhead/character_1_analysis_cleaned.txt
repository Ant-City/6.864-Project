[CHARACTER]

in direct contrast to roark, ellsworth monkton
toohey embodies everything evil about mankind. he is irredeemably
corrupt and evil. whereas roark never tries to win friends or influence
people, toohey's power lies entirely in his ability to control weaker
minds and souls. toohey's evil is as ingrained as roark's goodness--toohey
learns the practice of manipulation as a child, and turns it into
an art by the time he graduates from college. by making people feel
small and guilty, toohey shakes their faith in their own abilities
and then assumes control of their lives. toohey preaches selflessness
and ignorance of the ego to force people to act with humble mediocrity.
toohey has no talents of his own, so he makes himself excellent
by grinding down his followers. his tactics frequently evoke those
of joseph stalin, the former russian revolutionary who emerged as
russia's dictator.
