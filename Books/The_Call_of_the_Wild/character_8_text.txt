of francois’s whip
sang through the air, reaching the culprit first; and nothing remained
to buck but to recover the bone. that was fair of francois, he decided,
and the half-breed began his rise in buck’s estimation.

the other dog made no advances, nor received any; also, he did not
attempt to steal from the newcomers. he was a gloomy, morose fellow, and
he showed curly plainly that all he desired was to be left alone, and
further, that there would be trouble if he were not left alone. “dave”
 he was called, and he ate and slept, or yawned between times, and took
interest in nothing, not even when the narwhal crossed queen charlotte
sound and rolled and pitched and bucked like a thing possessed. when
buck and curly grew excited, half wild with fear, he raised his head as
though annoyed, favored them with an incurious glance, yawned, and went
to sleep again.

day and night the ship throbbed to the tireless pulse of the propeller,
and though one day was very like another, it was ap

 he had seen
the grooms put on the horses at home. and as he had seen horses work,
so he was set to work, hauling francois on a sled to the forest that
fringed the valley, and returning with a load of firewood. though his
dignity was sorely hurt by thus being made a draught animal, he was too
wise to rebel. he buckled down with a will and did his best, though
it was all new and strange. francois was stern, demanding instant
obedience, and by virtue of his whip receiving instant obedience;
while dave, who was an experienced wheeler, nipped buck’s hind quarters
whenever he was in error. spitz was the leader, likewise experienced,
and while he could not always get at buck, he growled sharp reproof now
and again, or cunningly threw his weight in the traces to jerk buck
into the way he should go. buck learned easily, and under the combined
tuition of his two mates and francois made remarkable progress. ere they
returned to camp he knew enough to stop at “ho,” to go ahead at “mush,”

by afternoon, perrault, who was in a hurry to be on the trail with his
despatches, returned with two more dogs. “billee” and “joe” he called
them, two brothers, and true huskies both. sons of the one mother though
they were, they were as different as day and night. billee’s one fault
was his excessive good nature, while joe was the very opposite, sour and
introspective, with a perpetual snarl and a malignant eye. buck received
them in comradely fashion, dave ignored them, while spitz proceeded to
thrash first one and then the other. billee wagged his tail appeasingly,
turned to run when he saw that appeasement was of no avail, and cried
(still appeasingly) when spitz’s sharp teeth scored his flank. but no
matter how spitz circled, joe whirled around on his heels to face
him, mane bristling, ears laid back, lips writhing and snarling, jaws
clipping together as fast as he could snap, and eyes diabolically
gleaming--the incarnation of belligerent fe

ar. so terrible was his
appearance that spitz was forced to forego disciplining him; but to
cover his own discomfiture he turned upon the inoffensive and wailing
billee and drove him to the confines of the camp.

by evening perrault secured another dog, an old husky, long and lean
and gaunt, with a battle-scarred face and a single eye which flashed a
warning of prowess that commanded respect. he was called sol-leks, which
means the angry one. like dave, he asked nothing, gave nothing, expected
nothing; and when he marched slowly and deliberately into their midst,
even spitz left him alone. he had one peculiarity which buck was unlucky
enough to discover. he did not like to be approached on his blind side.
of this offence buck was unwittingly guilty, and the first knowledge he
had of his indiscretion was when sol-leks whirled upon him and slashed
his shoulder to the bone for three inches up and down. forever after
buck avoided his blind side,

and to the last of their comradeship had
no more trouble. his only apparent ambition, like dave’s, was to be left
alone; though, as buck was afterward to learn, each of them possessed
one other and even more vital ambition.

that night buck faced the great problem of sleeping. the tent, illumined
by a candle, glowed warmly in the midst of the white plain; and when he,
as a matter of course, entered it, both perrault and francois bombarded
him with curses and cooking utensils, till he recovered from his
consternation and fled ignominiously into the outer cold. a chill wind

ticularly gladdened by the possession of buck.

three more huskies were added to the team inside an hour, making a total
of nine, and before another quarter of an hour had passed they were in
harness and swinging up the trail toward the dyea canon. buck was
glad to be gone, and though the work was hard he found he did not
particularly despise it. he was surprised at the eagerness which
animated the whole team and which was communicated to him; but still
more surprising was the change wrought in dave and sol-leks. they
were new dogs, utterly transformed by the harness. all passiveness and
unconcern had dropped from them. they were alert and active, anxious
that the work should go well, and fiercely irritable with whatever, by
delay or confusion, retarded that work. the toil of the traces seemed
the supreme expression of their being, and all that they lived for and
the only thing in which they took delight.

dave was wheeler or sled dog, pulling in front of him was buck, then
came sol-leks;

the rest of the team was strung out ahead, single file,
to the leader, which position was filled by spitz.

buck had been purposely placed between dave and sol-leks so that he
might receive instruction. apt scholar that he was, they were equally
apt teachers, never allowing him to linger long in error, and enforcing
their teaching with their sharp teeth. dave was fair and very wise. he
never nipped buck without cause, and he never failed to nip him when he
stood in need of it. as francois’s whip backed him up, buck found it
to be cheaper to mend his ways than to retaliate. once, during a brief
halt, when he got tangled in the traces and delayed the start, both
dave and solleks flew at him and administered a sound trouncing. the
resulting tangle was even worse, but buck took good care to keep the
traces clear thereafter; and ere the day was done, s

rs. never had buck seen such
dogs. it seemed as though their bones would burst through their skins.
they were mere skeletons, draped loosely in draggled hides, with blazing
eyes and slavered fangs. but the hunger-madness made them terrifying,
irresistible. there was no opposing them. the team-dogs were swept back
against the cliff at the first onset. buck was beset by three huskies,
and in a trice his head and shoulders were ripped and slashed. the din
was frightful. billee was crying as usual. dave and sol-leks, dripping
blood from a score of wounds, were fighting bravely side by side. joe
was snapping like a demon. once, his teeth closed on the fore leg of
a husky, and he crunched down through the bone. pike, the malingerer,
leaped upon the crippled animal, breaking its neck with a quick flash of
teeth and a jerk, buck got a frothing adversary by the throat, and was
sprayed with blood when his teeth sank through the jugular. the warm
taste of it in his mouth goaded him to greater fiercen

ifty below zero, and each time he broke through he was
compelled for very life to build a fire and dry his garments.

nothing daunted him. it was because nothing daunted him that he had been
chosen for government courier. he took all manner of risks, resolutely
thrusting his little weazened face into the frost and struggling on from
dim dawn to dark. he skirted the frowning shores on rim ice that bent
and crackled under foot and upon which they dared not halt. once, the
sled broke through, with dave and buck, and they were half-frozen and
all but drowned by the time they were dragged out. the usual fire was
necessary to save them. they were coated solidly with ice, and the two
men kept them on the run around the fire, sweating and thawing, so close
that they were singed by the flames.

at another time spitz went through, dragging the whole team after him up
to buck, who strained backward with all his strength, his fore paws on
the slippery edge and the ice quivering and snapping all around

. but
behind him was dave, likewise straining backward, and behind the sled
was francois, pulling till his tendons cracked.

again, the rim ice broke away before and behind, and there was no escape
except up the cliff. perrault scaled it by a miracle, while francois
prayed for just that miracle; and with every thong and sled lashing and
the last bit of harness rove into a long rope, the dogs were hoisted,
one by one, to the cliff crest. francois came up last, after the sled
and load. then came the search for a place to

nently cunning, and could bide
his time with a patience that was nothing less than primitive.

it was inevitable that the clash for leadership should come. buck wanted
it. he wanted it because it was his nature, because he had been
gripped tight by that nameless, incomprehensible pride of the trail and
trace--that pride which holds dogs in the toil to the last gasp, which
lures them to die joyfully in the harness, and breaks their hearts
if they are cut out of the harness. this was the pride of dave as
wheel-dog, of sol-leks as he pulled with all his strength; the pride
that laid hold of them at break of camp, transforming them from sour and
sullen brutes into straining, eager, ambitious creatures; the pride
that spurred them on all day and dropped them at pitch of camp at night,
letting them fall back into gloomy unrest and uncontent. this was the
pride that bore up spitz and made him thrash the sled-dogs who blundered
and shirked in the traces or hid away at harness-up time in the mornin

from his prostrate rival, and the butt of the whip was brought into
play. half-stunned by the blow, buck was knocked backward and the lash
laid upon him again and again, while spitz soundly punished the many
times offending pike.

in the days that followed, as dawson grew closer and closer, buck still
continued to interfere between spitz and the culprits; but he did it
craftily, when francois was not around, with the covert mutiny of buck,
a general insubordination sprang up and increased. dave and sol-leks
were unaffected, but the rest of the team went from bad to worse.
things no longer went right. there was continual bickering and jangling.
trouble was always afoot, and at the bottom of it was buck. he kept
francois busy, for the dog-driver was in constant apprehension of the
life-and-death struggle between the two which he knew must take place
sooner or later; and on more than one night the sounds of quarrelling
and strife among the other dogs turned him out of his sleeping robe,

billee, the good-natured, was less good-natured, and whined not half
so placatingly as in former days. buck never came near spitz without
snarling and bristling menacingly. in fact, his conduct approached that
of a bully, and he was given to swaggering up and down before spitz’s
very nose.

the breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs in their
relations with one another. they quarrelled and bickered more than ever
among themselves, till at times the camp was a howling bedlam. dave and
sol-leks alone were unaltered, though they were made irritable by the
unending squabbling. francois swore strange barbarous oaths, and stamped
the snow in futile rage, and tore his hair. his lash was always singing
among the dogs, but it was of small avail. directly his back was turned
they were at it again. he backed up spitz with his whip, while buck
backed up the remainder of the team. francois knew he was behind all the
trouble, and buck knew he knew; but buck was too clever ever again

with a heavy club in his hand.

buck remembered the man in the red sweater, and retreated slowly; nor
did he attempt to charge in when sol-leks was once more brought
forward. but he circled just beyond the range of the club, snarling with
bitterness and rage; and while he circled he watched the club so as to
dodge it if thrown by francois, for he was become wise in the way of
clubs. the driver went about his work, and he called to buck when he was
ready to put him in his old place in front of dave. buck retreated two
or three steps. francois followed him up, whereupon he again retreated.
after some time of this, francois threw down the club, thinking that
buck feared a thrashing. but buck was in open revolt. he wanted, not to
escape a clubbing, but to have the leadership. it was his by right. he
had earned it, and he would not be content with less.

perrault took a hand. between them they ran him about for the better
part of an hour. they threw clubs at him. he dodged. they cursed him,

ken out, and with both men running they dashed out
on to the river trail.

highly as the dog-driver had forevalued buck, with his two devils, he
found, while the day was yet young, that he had undervalued. at a bound
buck took up the duties of leadership; and where judgment was required,
and quick thinking and quick acting, he showed himself the superior even
of spitz, of whom francois had never seen an equal.

but it was in giving the law and making his mates live up to it, that
buck excelled. dave and sol-leks did not mind the change in leadership.
it was none of their business. their business was to toil, and toil
mightily, in the traces. so long as that were not interfered with, they
did not care what happened. billee, the good-natured, could lead for all
they cared, so long as he kept order. the rest of the team, however, had
grown unruly during the last days of spitz, and their surprise was great
now that buck proceeded to lick them into shape.

n, they passed out
of buck’s life for good.

a scotch half-breed took charge of him and his mates, and in company
with a dozen other dog-teams he started back over the weary trail to
dawson. it was no light running now, nor record time, but heavy toil
each day, with a heavy load behind; for this was the mail train,
carrying word from the world to the men who sought gold under the shadow
of the pole.

buck did not like it, but he bore up well to the work, taking pride in
it after the manner of dave and sol-leks, and seeing that his mates,
whether they prided in it or not, did their fair share. it was a
monotonous life, operating with machine-like regularity. one day was
very like another. at a certain time each morning the cooks turned out,
fires were built, and breakfast was eaten. then, while some broke camp,
others harnessed the dogs, and they were under way an hour or so before
the darkness fell which gave warning of dawn. at night, camp was made.

 dogs he drove. still, their strength went down. since the beginning
of the winter they had travelled eighteen hundred miles, dragging sleds
the whole weary distance; and eighteen hundred miles will tell upon life
of the toughest. buck stood it, keeping his mates up to their work and
maintaining discipline, though he, too, was very tired. billee cried and
whimpered regularly in his sleep each night. joe was sourer than ever,
and sol-leks was unapproachable, blind side or other side.

but it was dave who suffered most of all. something had gone wrong with
him. he became more morose and irritable, and when camp was pitched at
once made his nest, where his driver fed him. once out of the harness
and down, he did not get on his feet again till harness-up time in the
morning. sometimes, in the traces, when jerked by a sudden stoppage of
the sled, or by straining to start it, he would cry out with pain. the
driver examined him, but could find nothing. all the drivers became
interested in his cas

ast pipes before going to bed, and one night they held a consultation.
he was brought from his nest to the fire and was pressed and prodded
till he cried out many times. something was wrong inside, but they could
locate no broken bones, could not make it out.

by the time cassiar bar was reached, he was so weak that he was falling
repeatedly in the traces. the scotch half-breed called a halt and took
him out of the team, making the next dog, sol-leks, fast to the sled.
his intention was to rest dave, letting him run free behind the sled.
sick as he was, dave resented being taken out, grunting and growling
while the traces were unfastened, and whimpering broken-heartedly when
he saw sol-leks in the position he had held and served so long. for the
pride of trace and trail was his, and, sick unto death, he could not
bear that another dog should do his work.

when the sled started, he floundered in the soft snow alongside the
beaten trail, attacking sol-leks with his teeth, rushing against him

 and
trying to thrust him off into the soft snow on the other side, striving
to leap inside his traces and get between him and the sled, and all the
while whining and yelping and crying with grief and pain. the half-breed
tried to drive him away with the whip; but he paid no heed to the
stinging lash, and the man had not the heart to strike harder. dave
refused to run quietly on the trail behind the sled, where the going was
easy, but continued to flounder alongside in the soft snow, where the
going was most difficult, till exhausted. then he fell, and lay where he
fell, howling lugubriously as the long train of sleds churned by.

with the last remnant of his strength he managed to stagger along behind
till the train made another stop, when he floundered past the sleds to
his own, where he stood alongside sol-leks. his driver lingered a moment

to get a light for his pipe from the man behind. then he returned and
started his dogs. they swung out on the trail with remarkable lack of
exertion, turned their heads uneasily, and stopped in surprise. the
driver was surprised, too; the sled had not moved. he called his
comrades to witness the sight. dave had bitten through both of
sol-leks’s traces, and was standing directly in front of the sled in his
proper place.

he pleaded with his eyes to remain there. the driver was perplexed. his
comrades talked of how a dog could break its heart through being denied
the work that killed it, and recalled instances they had known, where
dogs, too old for the toil, or injured, had died because they were cut
out of the traces. also, they held it a mercy, since dave was to die
anyway, that he should die i
