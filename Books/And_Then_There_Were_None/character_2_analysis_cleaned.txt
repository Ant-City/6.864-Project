[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER] has the most mysterious past of anyone
on the island. he is a world traveler and a former military man
who seems to have served as a soldier of fortune in africa. in the
epilogue, one of the policemen describes him as having "been mixed
up in some very curious shows abroad . . . [the] sort of fellow
who might do several murders in some quiet out-of-the-way spot."
he comes to indian island after isaac morris hires him, supposedly
because mr. owen needs a "good man in a tight spot." clearly a dangerous
man, lombard carries a gun and is frequently described as moving
"like a panther." he is bold enough to initiate several searches
of the island, perceptive enough to suspect judge wargrave of being
the killer, and brave enough to voice his suspicions. lombard is
also honest: he owns up to his past misdeeds. when the recorded
voice accuses him of leaving twenty-one men from an east african
tribe to die in the bush, lombard cheerfully admits to it, saying
there was only enough food for himself and a friend, and so they
took off with it. the other characters cannot bring themselves to
admit their own guilt, but lombard has no such qualms.
	lombard does display a weakness, however, that ultimately brings
about his downfall: his chivalrous and old-fashioned attitude toward
women. in the first group conversation about the murders, he suggests
excluding the women from the list of potential suspects, since he
considers them incapable of homicidal behavior. lombard's tendency
to underestimate women enables vera to steal his gun and shoot him
when he jumps at her. in a strange way, his death unites vera and
lombard--they are the only characters to die at the hand of someone
other than wargrave.
