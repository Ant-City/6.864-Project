[CHARACTER] - 
      [CHARACTER] is the beautiful maiden with whom tommo falls in love. [CHARACTER] has blue eyes, olive skin, and long dark tresses. she represents the ultimate in innocence and beauty in the typee landscape. her character is an allusion to eve in eden. like the first woman, [CHARACTER] fully captivates tommo with her loveliness. some critics, however, have noted that [CHARACTER]'s character is never developed, so she remains a largely symbolic figure whose inner thoughts remain hidden.
