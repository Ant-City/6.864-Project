[CHARACTER] - 
                the
son and heir of montague and lady montague. a young man of about
sixteen, [CHARACTER] is handsome, intelligent, and sensitive. though impulsive
and immature, his idealism and passion make him an extremely likable
character. he lives in the middle of a violent feud between his
family and the capulets, but he is not at all interested in violence.
his only interest is love. at the beginning of the play he is madly
in love with a woman named rosaline, but the instant he lays eyes
on juliet, he falls in love with her and forgets rosaline. thus,
shakespeare gives us every reason to question how real [CHARACTER]'s new
love is, but [CHARACTER] goes to extremes to prove the seriousness of
his feelings. he secretly marries juliet, the daughter of his father's
worst enemy; he happily takes abuse from tybalt; and he would rather
die than live without his beloved. [CHARACTER] is also an affectionate
and devoted friend to his relative benvolio, mercutio, and friar lawrence.
