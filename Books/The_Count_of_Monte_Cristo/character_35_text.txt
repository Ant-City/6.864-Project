you, at least during the voyage. if you do not want me at leghorn, you
can leave me there, and i will pay you out of the first wages i get, for
my food and the clothes you lend me.â€

â€œah,â€ said the captain, â€œwe can agree very well, if you are reasonable.â€

â€œgive me what you give the others, and it will be all right,â€ returned
dantÃ¨s.

â€œthatâ€™s not fair,â€ said the seaman who had saved dantÃ¨s; â€œfor you know
more than we do.â€

â€œwhat is that to you, jacopo?â€ returned the captain. â€œeveryone is free
to ask what he pleases.â€

â€œthatâ€™s true,â€ replied jacopo; â€œi only make a remark.â€

â€œwell, you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of
trousers, if you have them.â€

â€œno,â€ said jacopo; â€œbut i have a shirt and a pair of trousers.â€

â€œthat is all i want,â€ interrupted dantÃ¨s. jacopo dived into the hold and
soon returned with what edmond wanted.

â€œnow, then, do you wish for anything else?â€ said the patron.

forty hours. a piece of bread was brought, and jacopo offered him the
gourd.

â€œlarboard your helm,â€ cried the captain to the steersman. dantÃ¨s glanced
that way as he lifted the gourd to his mouth; then paused with hand in
mid-air.

â€œhollo! whatâ€™s the matter at the chÃ¢teau dâ€™if?â€ said the captain.

a small white cloud, which had attracted dantÃ¨sâ€™ attention, crowned the
summit of the bastion of the chÃ¢teau dâ€™if. at the same moment the faint
report of a gun was heard. the sailors looked at one another.

â€œpretty strong rum! â€œ said dantÃ¨s, wiping his brow with his sleeve.

â€œat any rate,â€ murmured he, â€œif it be, so much the better, for i have
made a rare acquisition.â€ under pretence of being fatigued, dantÃ¨s asked
to take the helm; the steersman, glad to be relieved, looked at the
captain, and the latter by a sign indicated that he might abandon it to
his new comrade. dantÃ¨s could thus keep his eyes on marseilles.

â€œwhat is the day of the month?â€ asked he of jacopo, who sat down beside
him.

â€œthe 28th of february.â€

â€œin what year?â€

â€œin what year--you ask me in what year?â€

â€œyes,â€ replied the young man, â€œi ask you in what year!â€

â€œyou have forgotten then?â€

â€œi got such a fright last night,â€ replied dantÃ¨s, smiling, â€œthat i have
almost lost my memory. i ask you what year is it?â€

â€œthe year 1829,â€ returned jacopo. it was fourteen years, day for day,
since dantÃ¨sâ€™ arrest. he was nineteen when he entered the chÃ¢teau dâ

the master of _la jeune amÃ©lie_, who was very desirous of retaining
amongst his crew a man of edmondâ€™s value, had offered to advance him
funds out of his future profits, which edmond had accepted. his next
care on leaving the barberâ€™s who had achieved his first metamorphosis
was to enter a shop and buy a complete sailorâ€™s suit--a garb, as we all
know, very simple, and consisting of white trousers, a striped shirt,
and a cap. it was in this costume, and bringing back to jacopo the shirt
and trousers he had lent him, that edmond reappeared before the captain
of the lugger, who had made him tell his story over and over again
before he could believe him, or recognize in the neat and trim sailor
the man with thick and matted beard, hair tangled with seaweed, and body
soaking in seabrine, whom he had picked up naked and nearly drowned.
attracted by his prepossessing appearance, he renewed his offers of an
engagement to dantÃ¨s; but dantÃ¨s, who had his own projects, would

had contemplated danger with a smile, and when wounded had exclaimed
with the great philosopher, â€œpain, thou art not an evil.â€ he had,
moreover, looked upon the customs officer wounded to death, and, whether
from heat of blood produced by the encounter, or the chill of human
sentiment, this sight had made but slight impression upon him. dantÃ¨s
was on the way he desired to follow, and was moving towards the end he
wished to achieve; his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in his
bosom. jacopo, seeing him fall, had believed him killed, and rushing
towards him raised him up, and then attended to him with all the
kindness of a devoted comrade.

this world was not then so good as doctor pangloss believed it, neither
was it so wicked as dantÃ¨s thought it, since this man, who had nothing
to expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the
prize-money, manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall.
fortunately, as we have said, edmond was only wounded, and with certain

bs gathered at certain seasons, and sold to the smugglers by the old
sardinian women, the wound soon closed. edmond then resolved to try
jacopo, and offered him in return for his attention a share of his
prize-money, but jacopo refused it indignantly.

as a result of the sympathetic devotion which jacopo had from the first
bestowed on edmond, the latter was moved to a certain degree of
affection. but this sufficed for jacopo, who instinctively felt that
edmond had a right to superiority of position--a superiority which
edmond had concealed from all others. and from this time the kindness
which edmond showed him was enough for the brave seaman.

then in the long days on board ship, when the vessel, gliding on with
security over the azure sea, required no care but the hand of the
helmsman, thanks to the favorable winds that swelled her sails, edmond,
with a chart in his hand, became the instructor of jacopo, as the p

abbÃ© faria had been his tutor. he pointed out to him the bearings of the
coast, explained to him the variations of the compass, and taught him to
read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call heaven, and
where god writes in azure with letters of diamonds. and when jacopo
inquired of him, â€œwhat is the use of teaching all these things to a poor
sailor like me?â€ edmond replied, â€œwho knows? you may one day be the
captain of a vessel. your fellow-countryman, bonaparte, became emperor.â€
 we had forgotten to say that jacopo was a corsican.

two months and a half elapsed in these trips, and edmond had become as
skilful a coaster as he had been a hardy seaman; he had formed an
acquaintance with all the smugglers on the coast, and learned all the
masonic signs by

oâ€™clock the moon rose in the midst of the ocean, whose every wave she
silvered, and then, â€œascending high,â€ played in floods of pale light on
the rocky hills of this second pelion.

the island was familiar to the crew of _la jeune amÃ©lie_,--it was one of
her regular haunts. as to dantÃ¨s, he had passed it on his voyage to and
from the levant, but never touched at it. he questioned jacopo. â€œwhere
shall we pass the night?â€ he inquired.

â€œwhy, on board the tartan,â€ replied the sailor.

â€œshould we not do better in the grottos?â€

â€œwhat grottos?â€

â€œwhy, the grottos--caves of the island.â€

â€œi do not know of any grottos,â€ replied jacopo. the cold sweat sprang
forth on dantÃ¨sâ€™ brow.

â€œwhat, are there no grottos at monte cristo?â€ he asked.

â€œnone.â€

for a moment dantÃ¨s was speechless; then he remembered that these caves
might have been filled up by som

spicions. fortunately, as regarded this circumstance at least, his
painful past gave to his countenance an indelible sadness, and the
glimmerings of gayety seen beneath this cloud were indeed but
transitory.

no one had the slightest suspicion; and when next day, taking a fowling-
piece, powder, and shot, dantÃ¨s declared his intention to go and kill
some of the wild goats that were seen springing from rock to rock, his
wish was construed into a love of sport, or a desire for solitude.
however, jacopo insisted on following him, and dantÃ¨s did not oppose
this, fearing if he did so that he might incur distrust. scarcely,
however, had they gone a quarter of a league when, having killed a kid,
he begged jacopo to take it to his comrades, and request them to cook
it, and when ready to let him know by firing a gun. this and some dried
fruits and a flask of monte pulciano, was the bill of fare. dantÃ¨s went
on, looking from time to time behind and around about him. having
reached the summit of a r

ock, he saw, a thousand feet beneath him, his
companions, whom jacopo had rejoined, and who were all busy preparing
the repast which edmondâ€™s skill as a marksman had augmented with a
capital dish.

edmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a
man superior to his fellows. â€œin two hoursâ€™ time,â€ said he, â€œthese
persons will depart richer by fifty piastres each, to go and risk their
lives again by endeavoring to gain fifty more; then they will return
with a fortune of six hundred francs, and waste this treasure in some

ooked the kid. just at
the moment when they were taking the dainty animal from the spit, they
saw edmond springing with the boldness of a chamois from rock to rock,
and they fired the signal agreed upon. the sportsman instantly changed
his direction, and ran quickly towards them. but even while they watched
his daring progress, edmondâ€™s foot slipped, and they saw him stagger on
the edge of a rock and disappear. they all rushed towards him, for all
loved edmond in spite of his superiority; yet jacopo reached him first.

he found edmond lying prone, bleeding, and almost senseless. he had
rolled down a declivity of twelve or fifteen feet. they poured a little
rum down his throat, and this remedy which had before been so beneficial
to him, produced the same effect as formerly. edmond opened his eyes,
complained of great pain in his knee, a feeling of heaviness in his
head, and severe pains in his loins. they wished to carry him to the
shore; but when they touched him, although under jacopoâ€™s

â€œgo, go!â€ exclaimed dantÃ¨s.

â€œwe shall be absent at least a week,â€ said the patron, â€œand then we must
run out of our course to come here and take you up again.â€

â€œwhy,â€ said dantÃ¨s, â€œif in two or three days you hail any fishing-boat,
desire them to come here to me. i will pay twenty-five piastres for my
passage back to leghorn. if you do not come across one, return for me.â€
 the patron shook his head.

â€œlisten, captain baldi; thereâ€™s one way of settling this,â€ said jacopo.
â€œdo you go, and i will stay and take care of the wounded man.â€

â€œand give up your share of the venture,â€ said edmond, â€œto remain with
me?â€

â€œyes,â€ said jacopo, â€œand without any hesitation.â€

â€œyou are a good fellow and a kind-hearted messmate,â€ replied edmond,
â€œand heaven will recompense you for your generous intentions; but i do
not wish anyone to stay with me. a day or two of rest will set me up,
and i hope i shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent fo

a peculiar smile passed over dantÃ¨sâ€™ lips; he squeezed jacopoâ€™s hand
warmly, but nothing could shake his determination to remain--and remain
alone. the smugglers left with edmond what he had requested and set
sail, but not without turning about several times, and each time making
signs of a cordial farewell, to which edmond replied with his hand only,
as if he could not move the rest of his body. then, when they had
disappeared, he said with a smile,--â€œâ€˜tis strange that it should be
among such men that we find proofs of friendship and devotion.â€ t

hand of time, with his pickaxe. after ten minutesâ€™ labor the wall gave
way, and a hole large enough to insert the arm was opened. dantÃ¨s went
and cut the strongest olive-tree he could find, stripped off its
branches, inserted it in the hole, and used it as a lever. but the rock
was too heavy, and too firmly wedged, to be moved by anyone man, were he
hercules himself. dantÃ¨s saw that he must attack the wedge. but how? he
cast his eyes around, and saw the horn full of powder which his friend
jacopo had left him. he smiled; the infernal invention would serve him
for this purpose. with the aid of his pickaxe, dantÃ¨s, after the manner
of a labor-saving pioneer, dug a mine between the upper rock and the one
that supported it, filled it with powder, then made a match by rolling
his handkerchief in saltpetre. he lighted it and retired. the explosion
soon followed; the upper rock was lifted from its base by the terrific
force of the powder; the lower one flew into pieces; thousands of

ged them to make all the speed they could to
evade the enemy, when they could but lament the absence of dantÃ¨s, whose
superior skill in the management of a vessel would have availed them so
materially. in fact, the pursuing vessel had almost overtaken them when,
fortunately, night came on, and enabled them to double the cape of
corsica, and so elude all further pursuit. upon the whole, however, the
trip had been sufficiently successful to satisfy all concerned; while
the crew, and particularly jacopo, expressed great regrets that dantÃ¨s
had not been an equal sharer with themselves in the profits, which
amounted to no less a sum than fifty piastres each.


edmond preserved the most admirable self-command, not suffering the
faintest indication of a smile to escape him at the enumeration of all
the benefits he would have reaped had he been able to quit the island;
but as _la jeune amÃ©lie_ had merely come to monte cristo to fetch him
away, he embarked that same evening, and proceeded with the

leghorn. arrived at leghorn, he repaired to the house of a jew, a dealer
in precious stones, to whom he disposed of four of his smallest diamonds
for five thousand francs each. dantÃ¨s half feared that such valuable
jewels in the hands of a poor sailor like himself might excite
suspicion; but the cunning purchaser asked no troublesome questions
concerning a bargain by which he gained a round profit of at least
eighty per cent.

the following day dantÃ¨s presented jacopo with an entirely new vessel,
accompanying the gift by a donation of one hundred piastres, that he
might provide himself with a suitable crew and other requisites for his
outfit, upon condition that he would go at once to marseilles for the
purpose of inquiring after an old man named louis dantÃ¨s, residing in
the allÃ©es de meillan, and also a young woman called mercÃ©dÃ¨s, an
inhabitant of the catalan village. jacopo could scarcely believe his
senses at receiving this magnificent present, whic

h dantÃ¨s hastened to
account for by saying that he had merely been a sailor from whim and a
desire to spite his family, who did not allow him as much money as he
liked to spend; but that on his arrival at leghorn he had come into
possession of a large fortune, left him by an uncle, whose sole heir he
was. the superior education of dantÃ¨s gave an air of such extreme
probability to this statement that it never once occurred to jacopo to
doubt its accuracy. the term for which edmond had engaged to serve on
board _la jeune amÃ©lie_ having expired, dantÃ¨s took leave of the
captain, who at first tried all his powers of persuasion to induce him
to remain as one of the crew, but having been told the history of the
legacy, he ceased to importune him further. the following morning jacopo
set sail for marseilles, with directions from dantÃ¨s to join him at the
island of monte cristo.

a week passed by. dantÃ¨s employed it in manÅ“uvring his yacht round the
island, studying it as a skilful horseman would the animal he destined
for some important service, till at the end of that time he was
perfectly conversant with its good and bad qualities. the former dantÃ¨s
proposed to augment, the latter to remedy.

upon the eighth day he discerned a small vessel under full sail
approaching monte cristo. as it drew near, he recognized it as the boat
he had given to jacopo. he immediately signalled it. his signal was
returned, and in two hours afterwards the new-comer lay at anchor beside
the yacht. a mournful answer awaited each of edmondâ€™s eager inquiries as
to the information jacopo had obtained. old dantÃ¨s was dead, and
mercÃ©dÃ¨s had disappeared. dantÃ¨s listened to these melancholy tidings
with outward calmness; but, leaping lightly ashore, he signified his
desire to be quite alone. in a couple of hours he returned. two of the
men from jacopoâ€™s boat ca

sentry-box, watched the scene with delight, uttered these words in a low
tone: â€œbe happy, noble heart, be blessed for all the good thou hast done
and wilt do hereafter, and let my gratitude remain in obscurity like
your good deeds.â€


and with a smile expressive of supreme content, he left his hiding-
place, and without being observed, descended one of the flights of steps
provided for debarkation, and hailing three times, shouted â€œjacopo,
jacopo, jacopo!â€ then a launch came to shore, took him on board, and
conveyed him to a yacht splendidly fitted up, on whose deck he sprung
with the activity of a sailor; thence he once again looked towards
morrel, who, weeping with joy, was shaking hands most cordially with all
the crowd around him, and thanking with a look the unknown benefactor
whom he seemed to be seeking in the skies. â€œand now,â€ said the unknown,

arm on the sea-shore, valentine relating how monte cristo had appeared
in her room, explained everything, revealed the crime, and, finally, how
he had saved her life by enabling her to simulate death.

they had found the door of the grotto opened, and gone forth; on the
azure dome of heaven still glittered a few remaining stars. morrel soon
perceived a man standing among the rocks, apparently awaiting a sign
from them to advance, and pointed him out to valentine.

â€œah, it is jacopo,â€ she said, â€œthe captain of the yacht;â€ and she
beckoned him towards them.

â€œdo you wish to speak to us?â€ asked morrel.

â€œi have a letter to give you from the count.â€

â€œfrom the count!â€ murmured the two young people.

â€œyes; read it.â€


morrel opened the letter, and read:

â€œmy dear maximilian,

where monsieur noirtier awaits his granddaughter, whom he wishes to
bless before you lead her to the alta

first time of the madness of her father and the death of her brother,
she became pale, a heavy sigh escaped from her bosom, and tears, not the
less painful because they were silent, ran down her cheeks; her
happiness cost her very dear.

morrel looked around uneasily.

â€œbut,â€ he said, â€œthe countâ€™s generosity is too overwhelming; valentine
will be satisfied with my humble fortune. where is the count, friend?
lead me to him.â€

jacopo pointed towards the horizon.

â€œwhat do you mean?â€ asked valentine. â€œwhere is the count?--where is
haydÃ©e?â€

â€œlook!â€ said jacopo.

the eyes of both were fixed upon the spot indicated by the sailor, and
on the blue line separating the sky from the mediterranean sea, they
perceived a large white sail.

â€œgone,â€ said morrel; â€œgone!--adieu, my friend--adieu, my father!â€

â€œgone,â€ murmured valentine; â€œadieu, my sweet haydÃ©e--adieu, my sister!â€
