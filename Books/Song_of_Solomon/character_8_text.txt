into his lifestyle or into his limited moral vision. he is content to exist with
any ugliness in the world as long as it does not directly injure him—even
when he has had a hand in creating the ugliness, as with hagar.
actions contrary to those expected in the traditional hero are apparent
in milkman’s conspiring, with guitar, to steal from pilate’s house what
they believe is a bag of gold. the robbery is a violation comparable to rape.
pilate, reba, and hagar have welcomed milkman into their home. they
have fed him and given him spiritual sustenance, and hagar has welcomed
him into her bed. without compunction, milkman robs them of what he
believes is their most valuable possession. traditional heroes who steal, such
as jack and prometheus, do so for altruistic purposes—to save a starving
family, to find the way home, to rescue a captured princess, to aid humanity
in general. a larger moral purpose guides their small infractions of mora

could gather the values necessary to know himself and his family. the
lessons pilate subtly offers, if milkman is sensitive to them, could provide
the solid perch from which he can fly. her lessons also show, sometimes by
negative example, how he can shape responses to the world; those responses
will enable him to become pilate’s successor as the keeper of family honor and
believer in family traditions.15

as one of milkman’s lessons, consider the incident with reba’s lover.
pilate rescues her daughter from a man stupid enough to beat a woman who
has been more than generous to him. milkman watches as pilate, grasping
the man around the neck with one hand and wielding her knife over his
heart with the other, placidly lectures him on the limits of motherly tolerance.
milkman is impressed by the showmanship of the incident without realizing
its greater value: pilate shows a commitment to family first of all, and she
shows it without a destructive outcome. s

he controls her temper, and she
controls the man who has harmed reba. such actions are in contrast to milkman,
who, despite his more than six feet of height, is still immature; when
a potentially violent scene develops in the dead house, milkman responds
to it by threatening more violence to macon in retaliation for macon slapping
ruth. pilate’s patient settling of the dispute, her generous response to
the stranger, is in marked contrast to milkman’s self-centered attitude. her
actions are also a contrast to milkman’s treatment of hagar.

owy figures of his sisters or the blistering hatred his parents have
for each other. he finds a soothing place, one in which nothing is required of

in a world where the sands of materialism promise to smother even the most
altruistic soul. here, the love of money has no meaning. middle-class dress and
fancy whatnots are just as alien as milkman is initially in danville, pennsylvania,
and shalimar, virginia. pilate, reba, and hagar have allowed the world to
pass them by, at least the world in which most people find themselves trapped.
in their voluntary retreat, however, they have managed to salvage more valuable
things—a leisurely appreciation of life, joy in each other’s company, a love
of music, and the simple, credulous wonder in things as they are, with which
most adults have lost contact. most important, pilate has a security in, and a
comfort with, herself that milkman will perhaps never achieve; con

will show allegiance to pilate, who has repeatedly maintained that “you cant
just fly on off and leave a body” (147, 332, 333). emotionally, it is clear that
milkman, through his reflections and seeming changes of attitudes, follows
pilate. but the attraction to flying makes him confront guitar in what may
be a fatal end to the lessons he has just learned.
in confronting guitar, milkman may be flying off and leaving a body
again (pilate has specifically asked him to look after reba), but he does so
with a desire for commitment, an understanding of what his role should now
be in his family. and perhaps he understands his communal role as well, if we
view his soaring toward guitar as an act of love. he does take guitar with
him; if their flight ends in death, it can be viewed as milkman having saved
guitar from himself and from the gradually warping executions he carries
out. the death could also be viewed as vengeance, thereby creating a situation
in which milkman acts for

the tiny spaces into which macon and milkman have shoved them. without
value to brother or father, and without any animating love for their mother,
lena and corinthians exist as shadows whose substance can be measured
only by its fading from them into their brother’s future.
of all the female sacrifices made for milkman’s growth and development,
hagar’s is the most pathetic and pilate’s the most tragic. milkman
essentially destroys pilate’s family, for once hagar and pilate are dead, reba is
lost; unable to care for herself, she will probably be institutionalized. still, the
women make no effort to stop the destruction of their family, which begins
with hagar. their leniency and desire to give hagar whatever she wants combines
with milkman’s selfishness to ensure her downfall. while her desires
might be simple enough to see milkman as her quintessential fulfillment,
hagar fails to recognize that he cannot be counted on to reciprocate her
passion or her love. she is an adventur

women and for black women of his own social standing relegates hagar to a
small niche in milkman’s life; “she became a quasi-secret but permanent fixture”
(97–98). the relationship of the two families to each other also dictates
the quasi-secret status. certainly ruth would be appalled to know that milkman
is sleeping with his first cousin’s daughter, and macon would be livid
not only about this son having gone into pilate’s house but having become
hagar’s lover. by contrast, reba and pilate simply accept life as it is. though
coquettish at first, hagar shortly becomes milkman’s for the taking, a priceless
jewel diminishing its own value by its failure to value itself. she is one of
the reasons milkman is able to “stretch” “his carefree boyhood out for thirtyone
years” (98). hagar is his expected sexual outlet in the way that his sisters
are his maids—convenient and exploitable. when she centers her whole life
upon milkman, placing “duty squarely in the mid

guaranteed to gall any self-respecting woman, the letter reeks of distance
and emotional coldness; milkman can send it to hagar only because he does
not value or respect her. in the absence of any sense of family or communal
commitment, milkman dismisses hagar as easily as he perhaps dispossesses
his father’s tenants.
macon dead has put milkman in training to be callous, and reba and
pilate have unconsciously assured hagar’s victimization:
neither pilate nor reba knew that hagar was not like them. not
strong enough, like pilate, nor simple enough, like reba, to make
up her life as they had. she needed what most colored girls needed:

these pathetic women and the losses do not measure up, in the final
balance, to the loss of pilate’s life in milkman’s quest for identity, family, and
value beyond gold. teacher, nurturer, surrogate mother, keeper of the blues
tradition, pilate has always placed value on altruistic human relationships.
in all of these roles, she gives voice to the value of human connectedness. in
singing “o sugarman,” she serves as the herald for milkman’s birth. in singing
with reba and hagar, she articulates the pain macon feels and soothes
his wounds. in singing at hagar’s death, she voices the pain of loss in sound
rather than lyrics. and in singing the “song of solomon,” she places stress on
the intricate ties to african and black american history that unite all generations
of those scattered in the diaspora. in her voice is the blending of secular
and sacred traditions, natural and supernatural concerns.30

ration. milkman’s second stage of growth, the period of alienation
and desire for understanding, reflect the ordering principal behind the
mythic pattern. he begins to acknowledge a vague yearning for wholeness in
his otherwise other-directed existence. at the age of twelve, he befriends a
more worldly boy, guitar, who takes “him to the woman who [has] as much
to do with his future as she [has] his past” (35).
long since barred from the respectable macon dead family, pilate, her
daughter, reba, and reba’s daughter, hagar, emerge at an important juncture
in the text, for they provide a contrary and disruptive influence in the folk
image that they project to milkman. his perceptions of pilate, formed as they
are by macon who thinks of his sister as a “snake” (54), by townspeople who
identify her as “ugly, dirty, poor, drunk,” and by “sixth-grade schoolmates”
who subsequently tease him about his “queer aunt” (37), become less otherdirected
when he first meets her.

now on her own, pilate continues on her journey to virginia, and on
her way, she is first taken in by a preacher’s family. at school, she develops a
love for geography and is given a geography book by her teacher. she yearns
to travel about and so, with only her geography book, she joins with migrant
workers, and while she never finds her relations, she lives with a man on an
isolated island off the coast of virginia, and with him conceives her daughter,
reba. but pilate refuses to marry the man and sets out again for pennsylvania
to retrieve what she thinks are the murdered old man’s bones. she begins “the
wandering life that she [keeps] up for the next twenty-some-odd years, and
stop[s] only after reba [has] a baby” (148). thereafter, she seeks out and finds
her brother, believing that “hagar needed family, people, a life very different
from what she and reba could offer . . .” (151). hagar, as she grows older,

“collection of lunatics” who make wine and sing in the streets “like common
street women” (20). although he would like to put his bootlegger sister in
jail—that is, make use of the dominant society’s method of disciplining and
controlling the unruly underclass—he is afraid that she might “loudmouth
him and make him seem trashy in the eyes of the law—and the banks” (24).

and she rubs “mango tango on her cheeks” and puts “jungle red” on her lips
and “baby clear sky light” on her eyelids. but when hagar presents herself
to pilate and reba and sees herself reflected in their shaming gaze, she
recognizes what she was unable to see in the mirror: “the wet ripped hose,
the soiled white dress, the sticky, lumpy face powder, the streaked rouge,
and the wild wet shoals of hair” (314). hagar, who has always hated dirt
and disorganization, recognizes her social distance from milkman as she
perceives herself as a sad spectacle: as the dirty black underclass woman.

from the “shit” of racial shame—is also associated with the blaming, shaming
accusations of those left behind. in a similar way, as milkman takes pride in
his family name, the narrative also reminds readers of the painful, shameful

cousin, stating, “‘what the difference in the way you act toward ’em? don’t you
have to act the same way to both?’” (44). although pilate lives in “‘the blood
bank, because blood flowed so freely there,’” she leaves her door symbolically
unlocked; her daughter reba donates blood to the local hospital “as often as

injustice across the races, and the civil rights leaders knew it.
in song of solomon, blood kinship is disconnected from a vision of justice
and citizenship. blood is not the ink that inscribes identity and belonging.
while it symbolizes certain bonds, it has nothing to do with their articulation
and enaction. pilate both asserts and does not assert lines of blood. when
she explains her anger to the man who beats reba, for instance, she asks,
“‘you know how mamas are, don’t you? you got a mama, ain’t you?’” (94). in
the act of articulation and out of a desire to avert violence, she calls up the
significance of a blood bond. it is uttered, even manipulated, to make a connection
that is not based on blood. she also does not differentiate between
those to whom responsibility is and is not owed. she keeps a bag of a dead
stranger’s bones with her, contending that “‘the dead you kill is yours’
