teabing laughed heartily, patting his rotund belly. "touche. my only carnal pleasures these days
seem to be culinary. " turning now to sophie, he gently took her hand, bowing his head slightly,
breathing lightly on her fingers, and diverting his eyes. "m'lady."

sophie glanced at langdon, uncertain whether she'd stepped back in time or into a nuthouse.

the butler who had answered the door now entered carrying a tea service, which he arranged on a
table in front of the fireplace.

"this is remy legaludec," teabing said, "my manservant."

the slender butler gave a stiff nod and disappeared yet again.

"remy is lyonais, " teabing whispered, as if it were an unfortunate disease. "but he does sauces
quite nicely."

langdon looked amused. "i would have thought you'd import an english staff?"

"good heavens, no! i would not wish a british chef on anyone except the french tax collectors."
he glanced over at sophie. "pardonnez-moi, mademoiselle neveu. please be assured that my
distaste for the french e

nd not just any person," teabing blurted, clambering excitedly to his feet. "a woman who
carried with her a secret so powerful that, if revealed, it threatened to devastate the very foundation
of christianity!"

sophie looked overwhelmed. "is this woman well known in history?"

"quite." teabing collected his crutches and motioned down the hall. "and if we adjourn to the
study, my friends, it would be my honor to show you da vinci's painting of her."



two rooms away, in the kitchen, manservant remy legaludec stood in silence before a television.
the news station was broadcasting photos of a man and woman... the same two individuals to
whom remy had just served tea.

standing at the roadblock outside the depository bank of zurich, lieutenant collet wondered what

and the wood-burning could be seen through the wood. then he'd simply flipped the piece over,
and laid it in.

as sophie moved the lid closer to the light, she saw she was right. the bright beam sifted through
the thin layer of wood, and the script appeared in reverse on the underside of the lid.

instantly legible.

"english," teabing croaked, hanging his head in shame. "my native tongue."



at the rear of the plane, remy legaludec strained to hear beyond the rumbling engines, but the
conversation up front was inaudible. remy did not like the way the night was progressing. not at
all. he looked down at the bound monk at his feet. the man lay perfectly still now, as if in a trance
of acceptance, or perhaps, in silent prayer for deliverance.

fifteen thousand feet in the air, robert langdon felt the physical world fade away as all of his
thoughts converged on sauniere's mirror-image poem, which was illuminated

on the uneasy
sensation that someone had snuck in and poured plaster over the knights while they were sleeping.
all of the figures were deeply weathered, and yet each was clearly unique — different armory
pieces, distinct leg and arm positions, facial features, and markings on their shields.

in london lies a knight a pope interred.

langdon felt shaky as he inched deeper into the circular room.



this had to be the place.

deserted. he got out of the car, walked toward the rear, and climbed back into the limousine's main
cabin where the monk was.

sensing remy's presence, the monk in the back emerged from a prayer-like trance, his red eyes
looking more curious than fearful. all evening remy had been impressed with this trussed man's
ability to stay calm. after some initial struggles in the range r

ver his head. "i will not hesitate to smash this on the
floor and break the vial inside."

although silas sneered outwardly at the threat, he felt a flash of fear. this was unexpected. he
aimed the gun at langdon's head and kept his voice as steady as his hand. "you would never break
the keystone. you want to find the grail as much as i do."



you're wrong. you want it much more. you've proven you're willing to kill for it."



forty feet away, peering out from the annex pews near the archway, remy legaludec felt a rising
alarm. the maneuver had not gone as planned, and even from here, he could see silas was
uncertain how to handle the situation. at the teacher's orders, remy had forbidden silas to fire his
gun.

"let them go," langdon again demanded, holding the cryptex high over his head and staring into
silas's gun.

the monk's red eyes filled with anger and frustration, and remy tightened with fear that silas
might actually shoot langdon while he was holding the cryptex. the cryptex cannot fall

zero, collet sighed.



the only red flag tonight from interpol had been a set of fingerprints that apparently belonged to
teabing's servant. the chief pts examiner was reading the report in a comfortable chair across the
room.

collet looked over. "anything?"

the examiner shrugged. "prints belong to remy legaludec. wanted for petty crime. nothing
serious. looks like he got kicked out of university for rewiring phone jacks to get free service...
later did some petty theft. breaking and entering. skipped out on a hospital bill once for an
emergency tracheotomy." he glanced up, chuckling. "peanut allergy."

collet nodded, recalling a police investigation into a restaurant that had failed to notate on its menu
that the chili recipe contained peanut oil. an unsuspecting patron had died of anaphylactic shock a

trying to pull you back into safety for the last several hours."

a warm wind was now pushing through the station as a train approached with a low rumble.
sophie had every intention of being on it. langdon apparently had the same idea; he was gathering
himself together and moving toward her now.

"the man you want is remy legaludec," sophie said. "he is teabing's servant. he just kidnapped
teabing inside the temple church and — "

"agent neveu!" fache bellowed as the train thundered into the station. "this is not something to
discuss on an open line. you and langdon will come in now. for your own well-being! that is a
direct order!"

sophie hung up and dashed with langdon onto the train.

"of course."



"and you are welcome there?"

"as a brother."

"then go there and stay out of sight. i will call you the moment i am in possession of the keystone
and have attended to my current problem. "

"you are in london?"

"do as i say, and everything will be fine."

"yes, sir."

the teacher heaved a sigh, as if what he now had to do was profoundly regrettable. "it's time i
speak to remy."

silas handed remy the phone, sensing it might be the last call remy legaludec ever took.



as remy took the phone, he knew this poor, twisted monk had no idea what fate awaited him now
that he had served his purpose.

the teacher used you, silas.

and your bishop is a pawn.

remy still marveled at the teacher's powers of persuasion. bishop aringarosa had trusted
everything. he had been blinded by his own desperation. aringarosa was far too eager to believe.
although remy did not particularly like the teacher, he felt pride at having gained the man's trust
and helped him

his stiffening body could barely move. / trusted you with everything!

remy tried to lift his clenched fists to blow the horn, but instead he slipped sideways, rolling onto
the seat, lying on his side beside the teacher, clutching at his throat. the rain fell harder now.
remy could no longer see, but he could sense his oxygen-deprived brain straining to cling to his
last faint shreds of lucidity. as his world slowly went black, remy legaludec could have sworn he
heard the sounds of the soft riviera surf.

accelerated the necessity dramatically. robert

which teabing had placed specific lots. in sauniere's case, the curator had received a dinner
invitation to chateau villette to discuss the possibility of teabing's funding a new da vinci wing
at the louvre. sauniere's invitation had contained an innocuous postscript expressing fascination
with a robotic knight that sauniere was rumored to have built. bring him to dinner, teabing had
suggested. sauniere apparently had done just that and left the knight unattended long enough for
remy legaludec to make one inconspicuous addition.

the st. mary's hospital recovery room was sunny.

bishop aringarosa gave a weak smile. "i have always been blessed."
