 be  at  my  new  house  in  the  victor's  village.  the  reporters,  the 
camera crews, even effie trinket, my old escort, will have made their way to district 12 from 
the capitol. i wonder if effie will still be wearing that silly pink wig, or if she'll be sporting 
some other unnatural color especially for the victory tour. there will be others waiting, too. 
a staff to cater to my every need on the long train trip. a prep team to beautify me for public 
appearances. my stylist and friend, cinna, who designed the gorgeous outfits that first made 
the audience take notice of me in the hunger games. 

if it were up to me, i would try to forget the hunger games entirely. never speak of them. 
pretend  they  were  nothing  but  a  bad  dream.  but  the  victory  tour  makes  that  impossible. 
strategically  placed  almost  midway  between  the  annual  games,  it  is  the  capitol's  way  of 
keeping the horror fresh and immediate. not only are we in the districts forced to remember

really getting slippery out there.‚Äù 

‚Äúsomeone's  here  to  see  you,‚Äù  says  my  mother.  her  face  is  too  pale  and  i  can  hear  the 

anxiety she's trying to hide.

when i get home i'll  have to tell  him  something  about why our sundays are  a thing of the 
past, but i can't think about that now. only about  my next move. besides, gale's already so 
angry  and  frustrated  with  the  capitol  that  i  sometimes  think  he's  going  to  arrange  his  own 
uprising. the last thing he needs is an incentive. no, i can't tell anyone i'm leaving behind in 
district 12. 

there  are  still  three  people  i  might  confide  in,  starting  with  cinna,  my  stylist.  but  my 
guess is cinna might already be at risk, and i don't want to pull him into any more trouble by 
closer association with me. then there's peeta, who will be my partner in this deception, but 
how do i begin that conversation? hey, peeta, remember how i told you i was kind of faking 
being in love with you? well, i really need you to forget about that now and act extra in love 
with  me  or  the  president  might  kill  gale. i  can't  do  it.  besides,  peeta  will  perf

eryone wear feathers to her birthday party. 

soon  my  brows  are  stinging,  my  hair's  smooth  and  silky,  and  my  nails  are  ready  to  be 
painted.  apparently  they've  been  given  instruction  to  prepare  only  my  hands  and  face, 
probably because everything else will be covered in the cold weather. flavius badly wants to 
use  his own trademark purple  lipstick on  me  but resigns  himself to a pink as they  begin to 
color  my  face  and  nails.  i  can  see  by  the  palette  cinna  has  assigned  that  we're  going  for 
girlish, not sexy. 

good.  i'll  never  convince  anyone  of  anything  if  i'm  trying  to  be  provocative.  haymitch 

made that very clear when he was coaching me for my interview for the games. 

my  mother  comes  in,  somewhat  shyly,  and  says  that  cinna  has  asked  her  to  show  the 
preps  how  she  did  my  hair  the  day  of  the  reaping.  they  respond  with  enthusiasm  and  then 
watch, thoroughly engrossed, as she breaks down the p

of the elaborate braided hairdo. 
in the mirror, i can see their earnest faces following her every move, their eagerness when it 
is their turn to try a step. in fact, all three are so readily respectful and nice to my mother that 
i feel bad about how i go around feeling so superior to them. who knows who i would be or 
what i would talk about if i'd been raised in the capitol? maybe my biggest regret would be 
having feathered costumes at my birthday party, too. 

when my hair is done, i find cinna downstairs in the living room, and just the sight of him 
makes me feel more hopeful. he looks the same as always, simple clothes, short brown hair, 
just a hint of gold eyeliner.  we embrace, and i can  barely keep  from spilling out the entire 
episode with president snow. but no, i've decided to tell haymitch first. he'll know best who 
to burden with it. it's so easy to talk to cinna, though. lately we've been speaking a lot on the 
telephone that came with the house. it's sort of a joke, b
 
 ___________________________
 
ecause almost no one else we know 
owns  one.  there's  peeta,  but  obviously  i  don't  call  him.  haymitch  tore  his  out  of  the  wall 
years ago. my  friend  madge, the  mayor's daughter, has a telephone  in  her  house,  but  if we 
want to talk, we do it in person. at first, the thing barely ever got used. then cinna started to 
call to work on my talent. 

every  victor  is  supposed  to  have  one.  your  talent  is  the  activity  you  take  up  since  you 
don't  have  to  work  either  in  school  or  your  district's  industry.  it  can  be  anything,  really, 
anything that they can interview you about. peeta, it turns out, actually has a talent, which is 
painting. he's been frosting those cakes and cookies for years in his family's bakery. but now 
that he's rich, he can afford to smear real paint

on canvases. i don't have a talent, unless you 

count  hunting  illegally,  which  they  don't.  or  maybe  singing,  which  i  wouldn't  do  for  the 
capitol in a million years. my mother tried to interest me in a variety of suitable alternatives 
from a list effie trinket sent her. cooking, flower arranging, playing the flute. none of them 
took, although prim had a knack for all three. finally cinna stepped in and offered to help me 
develop  my  passion  for  designing  clothes,  which  really  required  development  since  it  was 
nonexistent. but i said yes because it meant getting to talk to cinna, and he promised he'd do 
all the work. 

now he's arranging things around my living room: clothing, fabrics, and sketchbooks with 
designs  he's  drawn.  i  pick  up  one  of  the  sketchbooks  and  examine  a  dress  i  supposedly 
created. ‚Äúyou know, i think i show a lot of promise,‚Äù

‚Äúget dressed, you worthless thing,‚Äù he says, tossing a bundle of clothes at me. 

i  may  have  no  interest  in  designing  clothes  but  i  do  love  the  ones  cinna  makes  for  me. 
like these. flowing black pants made of a thick, warm material. a comfortable white shirt. a 
sweater woven from green and blue and gray strands of kitten-soft wool. laced leather boots 
that don't pinch my toes. 

‚Äúdid i design my outfit?‚Äù i ask. 

‚Äúno, you aspire to design your outfit and be like me, your fashion hero,‚Äù says cinna. he 
hands  me  a  small  stack  of  cards.  ‚Äúyou'll  read  these  off  camera  while  they're  filming  the 
clothes. try to sound like

she kisses  me on both cheeks while waving  in the camera crew, then orders me 
into  position.  effie's  the  only  reason  we  got  anywhere  on  time  in  the  capitol,  so  i  try  to 
accommodate  her.  i  start  bobbing  around  like  a  puppet,  holding  up  outfits  and  saying 
meaningless  things  like  ‚Äúdon't  you  love  it?‚Äù  the  sound  team  records  me  reading  from  my 
cards in a chirpy voice so they can insert it later, then i'm tossed out of the room so they can 
film my/cinna's designs in peace. 

prim  got  out  early  from  school  for  the  event.  now  she  stands  in  the  kitchen,  being 
interviewed  by  another crew. she  looks  lovely  in a sky  blue  frock that brings out her eyes, 
her blond hair pulled back in a matching ribbon. she's leaning a bit forward on the toes of her 
shiny white boots like she's about to take flight, like‚Äî

so real i take a step bac

year-old girl from district 11 who was my ally in the arena. she could fly, birdlike, from tree 
to tree, catching on to the slenderest branches. rue, who i didn't save. who i let die. i picture 
her lying on the ground with the spear still wedged in her stomach... . 

who else will i fail to save from the capitol's vengeance? who else will be dead if i don't 

satisfy president snow? 

i realize cinna's trying to put a coat on me, so i raise my arms. i feel fur, inside and out, 
encasing  me. it's  from  no animal i've ever seen. ‚Äúermine,‚Äù he tells  me as i stroke the white 
sleeve. leather gloves. a bright red scarf. something furry covers my ears. ‚Äúyou're bringing 
earmuffs back in style.‚Äù 

i hate earmuffs, i think. they make it hard to hear, and since i was blasted deaf in one ear 
in the arena, i dislike them  even  more.  after i won, the capitol repaired  my  ear,  but i still

my mother hurries up with something cupped in her hand. ‚Äúfor good luck,‚Äù she says. 

it's the pin madge gave me before i left for the games. a mockingjay flying in a circle of 
gold. i tried to give it to rue but she wouldn't take it. she said the pin was the reason she'd 
decided to trust me. cinna fixes it on the knot in the scarf. 

effie  trinket's  nearby,  clapping  her  hands.  ‚Äúattention,  everyone!  we're  about  to  do  the 
first outdoor shot, where the victors greet each other at the beginning of their marvelous trip.

cameras. won't condemn me with a halfhearted kiss. he's still looking out for me. just as he 
did in the arena. somehow the thought makes me want to cry. instead i pull him to his feet, 
tuck my glove through the crook of his arm, and merrily pull him on our way. 

the rest of the day is a blur of getting to the station, bidding everyone good-bye, the train 
pulling  out,  the  old  team  ‚Äî  peeta  and  me,  effie  and  haymitch,  cinna  and  portia,  peeta's 
stylist‚Äîdining on an indescribably delicious meal i don't remember. and then i'm swathed in 
pajamas and a voluminous robe, sitting in my plush compartment, waiting for the others to go 
to sleep. i know haymitch will be up for hours. he doesn't like to sleep when it's dark out. 

when  the  train  seems  quiet,  i  put  on  my  slippers  and  pad  down  to  his  door.  i  have  to 

knock several times before he answers, scowling, as if he's certain i've brought bad n

they've prepared  my  favorite,  lamb  stew with dried plums, among other delicacies. orange 
juice and a pot of steaming hot chocolate wait at my place at the table. so i eat a lot, and the 
meal  is  beyond  reproach,  but  i  can't  say  i'm  enjoying  it.  i'm  also  annoyed  that  no  one  but 
effie and i has shown up. 

‚Äúwhere's everybody else?‚Äù i ask. 

‚Äúoh, who knows where haymitch is,‚Äù says effie. i didn't really expect haymitch, because 
he's probably just getting to bed. ‚Äúcinna was up late working on organizing your garment car. 
he must have over a hundred outfits for you. your evening clothes are exquisite. and peeta's 
team is probably still asleep.‚Äù 

‚Äúdoesn't he need prepping?‚Äù i ask. 

‚Äúnot the way you do,‚Äù effie replies. 

what does this mean? it means i get to spend the morning having the hair ripped off my 
body while peeta sleeps in. i hadn't thought about  it much, but in the arena at least some of 
the  boys  got to  keep their  body  hair  where

curly down on my legs and give myself over to the team. none of them are up to their usual 
chatter, so i can hear every strand being yanked from its follicle. i have to soak in a tub full of 
a thick, unpleasant-smelling solution, while my face and hair are plastered with creams. two 
more  baths  follow  in  other,  less  offensive,  concoctions.  i'm  plucked  and  scoured  and 
massaged and anointed until i'm raw. 

flavius tilts up my chin and sighs. ‚Äúit's a shame cinna said no alterations on you.‚Äù 

‚Äúyes, we could really make you something special,‚Äù says octavia. 

‚Äúwhen she's older,‚Äù says venia almost grimly. ‚Äúthen he'll have to let us.‚Äù

competing  for  my  attention‚Äî  my  abused  body,  my  lack  of  sleep,  my  mandatory  marriage, 
and the terror of being unable to satisfy president snow's demands. by the time i reach lunch, 
where  effie,  cinna,  portia,  haymitch,  and  peeta  have  started  without  me,  i'm  too  weighed 
down to talk. they're raving about the food and how well they sleep on trains. everyone's all 
full of excitement about the tour. well, everyone but haymitch. he's nursing a hangover and 
picking  at  a  muffin.  i'm  not  really  hungry,  either,  maybe  because  i  loaded  up  on  too  much 
rich stuff this morning or maybe because i'm so unhappy. i play around with a bowl of broth,

‚Äúmaybe they won't. haymitch‚Äôs haven't.‚Äù haymitch doesn't say so, but i'm sure this is why 

he doesn't like to sleep in the dark. 

‚Äúno. but for me, it's better to wake up with a paintbrush than a knife in my hand,‚Äù he says. 

‚Äúso you really hate them?‚Äù 

‚Äúyes. but they're extraordinary. really,‚Äù i say.  and they are. but i don't want to  look at 

them anymore. ‚Äúwant to see my talent? cinna did a great job on it.‚Äù 

peeta  laughs.  ‚Äúlater.‚Äù  the  train  lurches  forward,  and  i  can  see  the  land  moving  past  us 

through the window. ‚Äúcome on, we're almost to district eleven. let's go take a look at it.‚Äù 

we go down to the last car on the train. there are chairs and couches to sit on, but what's 
wonderful  is  that  the  back  windows  retract  into  the  ceiling  so  you're  riding  outside,  in  the 
fresh  air,  and  you  can  see  a  wide  sweep  of  the  land

crowd? how exactly did rue end up on that stage with nothing but the wind offering to take 
her place? 

i begin to weary of the vastness, the endlessness of this place. when effie comes to tell us 

to dress, i don't object. 

i go to  my  compartment and  let the prep team do my  hair and  makeup. cinna comes  in 
with a pretty orange frock patterned with autumn leaves. i think how much peeta will like the 
color. 

effie  gets  peeta  and  me  together  and  goes  through  the  day's  program  one  last  time.  in 
some districts the victors ride through the city while the residents cheer. but in 11 ‚Äî maybe 
because  there's  not  much  of  a  city  to  begin  with,  things  being  so  spread  out,  or  maybe 
because  they  don't  want  to  waste  so  many  people  while  the  harvest  is

hard  for  me  to  talk  about  them  without  getting  emotional.  fortunately,  peeta  has  a  little 
something worked up, and with some slight alterations, it can count for both of us. at the end 
of the ceremony, we'll be presented with some sort of plaque, and then we can withdraw to 
the justice building, where a special dinner will be served. 

as the train is pulling into the district 11 station, cinna puts the finishing touches on my 
outfit,  switching  my  orange  hairband  for one  of  metallic  gold  and  securing  the  mockingjay 
pin i wore in the arena to my dress. there's no welcoming, committee on the platform, just a 
squad of eight peacekeepers who direct us into the back of an armored truck. effie sniffs as 
the door clanks closed behind us. ‚Äúreally, you'd think we were all criminals,‚Äù she says. 

not all of us, effie. just me, i think. 

the truck lets us out at the back of

right? come on, katniss.‚Äù his arm encircles me and guides me back into the justice building. 
the peacekeepers follow a pace or two behind us. the moment we're inside, the doors slam 
shut and we hear the peacekeepers' boots moving back toward the crowd. 

haymitch, effie, portia, and cinna wait under a static-filled screen that's mounted on the 

wall, their faces tight with anxiety. 

‚Äúwhat  happened?‚Äù  effie  hurries  over.  ‚Äúwe  lost  the  feed  just  after  katniss's  beautiful 
speech, and then haymitch said he thought he heard a gun fire, and i said it was ridiculous,

keep seeing the old man's head being blown off. i don't even pay attention to what anyone is 
doing to me until i'm about to leave and i see myself in the mirror. a pale pink strapless dress 
brushes  my  shoes.  my  hair  is  pinned  back  from  my  face  and  falling  down  my  back  in  a 
shower of ringlets. 

cinna comes up behind me and arranges a shimmering silver wrap around my shoulders.

‚Äúit's beautiful. as always,‚Äù i say.

and portia know, but there seems to be an unspoken agreement to leave effie out of the bad-
news loop. it doesn't take long to hear about the problem, though. 

effie runs through the evening's schedule, then tosses it aside. ‚Äúand then, thank goodness, 

we can all get on that train and get out of here,‚Äù she says. 

‚Äúis something wrong, effie?‚Äù asks cinna.

 the faces of the people at the sight of us, 
and under the elation, fury. when they chant my name, it is more of a cry for vengeance than 

a cheer. when the peacekeepers move in to quiet an unruly crowd, it presses back instead of 
retreating. and i know that there's nothing i could ever do to change this. no show of love, 
however  believable,  will  turn  this  tide.  if  my  holding  out  those  berries  was  an  act  of 
temporary insanity, then these people will embrace insanity, too. 

cinna begins to take in my clothes around the waist. the prep team frets over the circles 
under my eyes. effie starts giving me pills to sleep, but they don't work. not well enough. i 
drift off only to be roused by nightmares that have increased in number and intensity. peeta, 
who spends  much of the  night roaming the train, hears  me  screaming as i struggle to break 
out of the haze of drugs that merely prolong the horrible dreams. he manages to wake me and 
calm  me  down.  then  he  climbs  i

‚Äúeffie said we have to be on the train at one. i wonder what time it is,‚Äù he says, glancing 

around. 

‚Äúalmost midnight,‚Äù i reply. i pluck a  chocolate  flower  from a cake with  my  fingers and 

nibble on it, so beyond worrying about manners. 

‚Äútime to say thank you and farewell!‚Äù trills effie at my elbow. it's one of those moments 
when i just love her compulsive punctuality. we collect cinna and portia, and she escorts us 
around to say good-bye to important people, then herds us to the door. 

‚Äúshouldn't we thank president snow?‚Äù asks peeta. ‚Äúit's his house.‚Äù 

‚Äúoh,  he's  not a big one  for parties. too busy,‚Äù says effie.  ‚Äúi've already  arranged  for the 
necessary  notes  and  gifts  to  be  sent  to  him  tomorrow.  there  you  are!‚Äù  effie  gives  a  little 
wave to two capitol attendants who have an inebriated haymitch propped up between them.

train and it's pulling out of the station. 

haymitch is deposited in his room. cinna orders tea and we all take seats around the table 
while effie rattles her schedule papers and reminds us we're still on tour. ‚Äúthere's the harvest 
festival in district twelve to think about. so i suggest we drink our tea and head straight to 
bed.‚Äù no one argues. 

when i open my eyes, it's early afternoon. my head rests on peeta's arm. i don't remember

below  them,  there's  a  mob  scene.  the  square's  packed  with  screaming  people,  their  faces 
hidden with rags and homemade masks, throwing bricks. buildings burn. peacekeepers shoot 
into the crowd, killing at random. 

i've  never  seen  anything  like  it,  but  i  can  only  be  witnessing  one  thing.  this  is  what 

president snow calls an uprising.

direction  i  will  travel.  this  is  what  i  leave  for  gale  at  our  usual  meeting  place  on  the  first 
sunday after the harvest festival. 

i have continued on through the cold, misty woods, breaking a path that will be unfamiliar 
to gale but is simple for my feet to find. it leads to the lake. i no longer trust that our regular

it's a surprisingly short time before he appears. a bow slung over his shoulder, a dead wild 
turkey  he  must  have  encountered  along  the  way  hanging  from  his  belt.  he  stands  in  the 
doorway as if considering whether or not to enter. he holds the unopened leather bag of food, 
the flask, cinna's gloves. gifts he will not accept because of his anger at me. i know exactly 
how he feels. didn't i do the same thing to my mother? 

i look in his eyes. his temper can't quite mask the hurt, the sense of betrayal he feels at my 
engagement  to  peeta.  this  will  be  my  last  chance,  this  meeting  today,  to  not  lose  gale 
forever. i could take hours trying to explain, and even then have him refuse me. instead i go

is  not  a  funny  moment,  but  i  guess  it's  a  lot  to  drop  on  someone.  we're  all  going  to  be 
obliterated no matter what. ‚Äúi do have a plan, you know.‚Äù 

‚Äúyeah, i bet it's a stunner,‚Äù he says. he tosses the gloves on my lap. ‚Äúhere. i don't want 

your fianc√©‚Äôs old gloves.‚Äù 

‚Äúhe's  not  my  fianc√©.  that's  just  part  of  the  act.  and  these  aren't  his  gloves.  they  were 

cinna's,‚Äù i say. 

‚Äúgive  them  back,  then,‚Äù  he  says.  he  pulls  on  the  gloves,  flexes  his  fingers,  and  nods  in 

approval. ‚Äúat least i'll die in comfort.‚Äù 

‚Äúthat's optimistic. of course, you don't know what's happened,‚Äù i say. 

‚Äúlet's have it,‚Äù he says. 

i decide to  begin with the night peeta and i were crowned victors of the hunger games, 
and haymitch warned me of the capitol's fury. i tell him about the uneasiness that dogged me 
even once i was back home, presid

 happy enough to go before. i don't see how an uprising in district eight does 
anything  but  make  it  more  important  that  we  leave.  you're  just  mad  about‚Äî‚Äù  no,  i  can't 
throw peeta in his face. ‚Äúwhat about your family?‚Äù 

‚Äúwhat about the other families, katniss? the ones who can't run away? don't you see? it 
can't be about just saving us anymore. not if the rebellion's begun!‚Äù gale shakes his head, not 
hiding his disgust with me. ‚Äúyou could do so much.‚Äù he throws cinna's gloves at my feet. ‚Äúi 
changed my mind. i don't want anything they made in the capitol.‚Äù and he's gone. 

i look down at the gloves. anything they  made  in the capitol?  was that directed at me? 
does  he  think  i  am  now  just  another  product  of  the  capitol  and  therefore  something 
untouchable? the unfairness of it all fills me with rage. but it's mixed up with fear over what 
kind of crazy thing he might do next. 

i  sink  down  next  to  the  fire,  desperate  for  comfort,

's what i told them. i said any girl who goes to such lengths to preserve her life isn't 

going to be interested in throwing it away with both hands.‚Äù 

i think of how hard hazelle has worked to keep that family alive. surely she'll be on my 

side in this matter. or won't she? 

it must be getting on toward noon now and the days are so short. no point in being in the 
woods after dark if  you don't have to. i stamp out the remains of  my  little  fire, clear up the 
scraps of food, and tuck cinna's gloves in my belt. i guess i'll hang on to them for a while. in 
case  gale  has  a  change  of  heart.  i think  of  the  look on  his  face  when  he  flung  them  to the 
ground. how repelled he was by them, by me ... 

i  trudge  through  the  woods  and  reach  my  old  house  while  there's  still  light.  my 
conversation with gale was an obvious setback, but i'm still determined to carry on with my 
plan to escape district 12. i decide to find peeta next. in a strange way, since he's

the wedding. is he really planning to go through with it? what, in his twisted brain, will 
that achieve? is it for the benefit of those in the capitol? a wedding was promised, a wedding 
will be given. and then he'll kill us? as a lesson to the districts? i don't know. i can't make 

sense of it. i toss and turn in bed until i can't stand it anymore. i have to get out of here. at 
least for a few hours. 

my hands dig around in my closet until i find the insulated winter gear cinna made for me 
for recreational use on the victory tour. waterproof boots, a snowsuit that covers me from 
head to toe, thermal gloves. i love my old hunting stuff, but the trek i have in mind today is 
more suited to this high-tech clothing. i tiptoe downstairs, load my game bag with food, and 
sneak  out  of  the  house.  slinking  along  side  streets  and  back  alleys,  i  make  my  way  to  the 
weak spot in the fence closest to rooba the butcher's. since many workers cross this way to

maybe  to  say  good-bye  to  the  place,  to  my  father  and  the  happy  times  we  spent  there, 
because i know i'll probably never return. maybe just so i can draw a complete breath again. 
part of me doesn't really care if they catch me, if i can see it one more time. 

the trip takes twice as long as usual. cinna's clothes hold in the heat all right, and i arrive 
soaked  with  sweat  under  the  snowsuit  while  my  face  is  numb  with  cold.  the  glare  of  the 
winter  sun  off  the  snow  has  played  games  with  my  vision,  and  i  am  so  exhausted  and 
wrapped  up  in  my  own  hopeless  thoughts  that  i  don't  notice  the  signs.  the  thin  stream  of 
smoke  from  the  chimney,  the  indentations  of  recent  footprints,  the  smell  of  steaming  pine 
needles. i am  literally  a  few

peeta sits on the side of the bed, warming my hand in both of his. ‚Äúalmost thought you'd 

changed your mind today. when you were late for dinner.‚Äù 

i'm foggy but i can guess what he means. with the fence going on and me showing up late 

and the peacekeepers waiting, he thought i'd made a run for it, maybe with gale. 

‚Äúno, i'd have told you,‚Äù i say. i pull his hand up and lean my cheek against the back of it, 
taking  in the  faint  scent of  cinnamon and dill  from the  breads  he  must have  baked today. i 
want to tell  him about twill and bonnie and the uprising and the fantasy of district 13, but 

it's not safe to and i can feel myself slipping away, so i just get out one more sentence. ‚Äústay 
with me.‚Äù 

as the tendrils of sleep syrup pull me down, i hear him whisper a word back, but i don't 

quite catch it. 

my mother lets me sleep until noon, then rouses me to examine my heel. i'm ordered to a

y makes an impact on them. by the 
time  i'm  ready  to  be  dressed,  their  complaints  about  the  difficulty  of  getting  different 
products  ‚Äî  from  crabmeat  to  music  chips  to  ribbons  ‚Äî  has  given  me  a  sense  of  which 
districts might actually be rebelling. seafood from district 4. electronic gadgets from district 
3. and, of course, fabrics from district 8. the thought of such widespread rebellion has me 
quivering with fear and excitement. 

i want to ask them more, but cinna appears to give me a hug and check my makeup. his 
attention goes right to the scar on my cheek. somehow i don't think he believes the slipping-

on-the-ice  story,  but  he  doesn't  question  it.  he  simply  adjusts  the  powder  on  my  face,  and 
what little you can see of the lash mark vanishes. 

downstairs, the living room has been cleared and lit for the photo shoot. effie's having a 
fine time ordering everybody around, keeping us all on schedule. it's probably a good thing,

and greenery. a sheath of diamonds and jeweled veil and moonlight. heavy white silk 
and  sleeves that fall  from  my wrist to the  floor, and pearls. the  moment one shot has  been 
approved,  we  move  right  into  preparing  for  the  next.  i  feel  like  dough,  being  kneaded  and 
reshaped again and again. my mother manages to feed me bits of food and sips of tea while 
they work on me, but by the time the shoot is over, i'm starving and exhausted. i'm hoping to 
spend  some  time  with  cinna  now,  but  effie  whisks  everybody  out  the  door  and  i  have  to 
make do with the promise of a phone call. 

evening has fallen and my foot hurts from all the crazy shoes, so i abandon any thoughts 
of  going  into  town.  instead  i  go  upstairs  and  wash  away  the  layers  of  makeup  and 
conditioners and dyes  and then go down to dry  my  hair  by the  fire. prim, who came  home 
from school in time to see the last two dresses, chatters on about them with my mother. they

to run. but he must 
also know that if we don't revolt in 12, i'm destined to be peeta's bride. seeing me lounging 
around in gorgeous gowns on his television ... what can he do with that? 

when  we  gather  around  the television  at  seven-thirty,  i  discover  that  prim  is  right.  sure 
enough, there's  caesar flickerman, speaking  before a standing-room-only  crowd  in  front of 
the  training  center,  talking  to  an  appreciative  crowd  about  my  upcoming  nuptials.  he 
introduces cinna, who became an overnight star with his costumes for me in the games, and 
after a minute of good-natured chitchat, we're directed to turn our attention to a giant screen. 

i  see  now  how  they  could  photograph  me  yesterday  and  present  the  special  tonight. 
initially, cinna designed two dozen wedding gowns. since then, there's  been the process of 
narrowing down the designs, creating the dresses, and choosing the accessories. apparently, 
in  the  capitol,  there  were  opportunitie

 of  that  will  be  forgotten  once  the  gong  sounds,  but  it's  something  of  a 
revelation that those in the capitol feel anything at all about us. they certainly don't have a 
problem watching children  murdered every  year. but maybe they know too  much about the 
victors,  especially  the  ones  who've  been  celebrities  for  ages,  to  forget  we're  human  beings. 
it's more like watching your own friends die. more like the games are for those of us in the 
districts. 

by the time cinna shows up, i am irritable and exhausted from comforting the prep team, 
especially because their constant tears are reminding me of the ones undoubtedly being shed 
at home. standing there in my thin robe with my stinging skin and heart, i know i can't bear 
even one more look of regret. so the moment he walks in the door i snap, ‚Äúi swear if you cry, 
i'll kill you here and now.‚Äù 

cinna just smiles. ‚Äúhad a damp morning?‚Äù 

‚Äúyou could wring me out,‚Äù i reply. 

cinna puts his arm arou

channel my emotions into my work. that way i don't hurt anyone but myself.‚Äù 

‚Äúi can't go through that again,‚Äù i warn him. 

‚Äúi know. i'll talk to them,‚Äù says cinna. 

lunch  makes  me  feel a  bit  better. pheasant with  a selection of  jewel-colored  jellies, and 
tiny  versions of real  vegetables  swimming  in  butter, and potatoes mashed with parsley.  for 
dessert we dip chunks of fruit in a pot of melted chocolate, and cinna has  to order a second 
pot because i start just eating the stuff with a spoon. 

‚Äúso, what are we wearing for the opening ceremonies?‚Äù i finally ask as i scrape the second 
pot  clean.  ‚Äúheadlamps  or  fire?‚Äù  i  know

the  chariot  ride  will  require  peeta  and  me  to  be

‚Äúsomething along that line,‚Äù he says. 

when it's time to get in costume for the opening ceremonies, my prep team shows up but 
cinna  sends  them  away,  saying  they've  done  such  a  spectacular  job  in  the  morning,  there's 

nothing left to do. they go off to recover, thankfully leaving me in cinna's hands. he puts up 
my  hair  first,  in  the  braided  style  my  mother  introduced  him  to,  then  proceeds  with  my 
makeup. last  year  he used  little so that the audience would recognize  me when i  landed  in 
the arena. but now my face is almost obscured by the dramatic highlights and dark shadows. 
high  arching  eyebrows,  sharp  cheekbones,  smoldering  eyes,  deep  purple  lips.  the  costume 
looks  deceptively  simple  at  first,  just  a  fitted  black  jumpsuit  that  covers

 the fabric on my wrist. i look down, fascinated, as my ensemble 
slowly comes to life, first with a soft golden light but gradually transforming to the orange-
red  of  burning  coal.  i  look  as  if  i  have  been  coated  in  glowing  embers  ‚Äî  no,  that  i am a 
glowing ember straight from our fireplace. the colors rise and fall, shift and blend, in exactly 
the way the coals do. 

‚Äúhow did you do this?‚Äù i say in wonder. 

‚Äúportia and i spent a lot of hours watching fires,‚Äù says cinna. ‚Äúnow look at yourself.‚Äù 

he turns me toward a mirror so that i can take in the entire effect. i do not see a girl, or 
even  a  woman,  but  some  unearthly  being  who  looks  like  she  might  make  her  home  in  the 
volcano that destroyed  so  many  in  haymitch's quell. the  black crown, which  now appears 
red-hot, casts strange shadows on my dramatically made-up face. katniss, the girl on fire, has 
left  behind her flickering flames and bejeweled gowns and soft candlelight frocks

‚Äúi think ... this is just what i needed to face the others,‚Äù i say. 

‚Äúyes,  i  think  your  days  of  pink  lipstick  and  ribbons  are  behind  you,‚Äù  says  cinna.  he 
touches the button on my wrist again, extinguishing my light. ‚Äúlet's not run down your power 
pack.  when  you're on the  chariot this time,  no waving,  no smiling. i  just want  you to look 
straight ahead, as if the entire audience is beneath your notice.‚Äù 

‚Äúfinally something i'll be good at,‚Äù i say. 

cinna has a few more things to attend to, so i decide to head down to the ground floor of 
the remake center, which houses the huge gathering place for the tributes and their ch

‚Äúabsolutely.  but  portia  says  we're  to  be  very  above  it  all.  no  waving  or  anything,‚Äù  he 

says. ‚Äúwhere are they, anyway?‚Äù 

‚Äúi don't know.‚Äù i eye the procession of chariots. ‚Äúmaybe  we  better go ahead and switch 
ourselves on.‚Äù we do, and as we begin to glow, i can see people pointing at us and chattering, 
and i know that, once again, we'll be the talk of the opening ceremonies. we're almost at the 
door. i crane my head around, but neither portia nor cinna, who were with us right up to the 
final second  last  year, are anywhere  in sight. ‚Äúare we supposed to hold  hands this  year?‚Äù i 
ask. 

‚Äúi guess they've left it up to us,‚Äù says peeta. 

i look up into those blue eyes that no amount of dramatic makeup can make truly deadly 
and remember how, just a year ago, i was prepared to kill him. convinced he was trying to 
kill me. now everything is reversed. i'm determined to keep him alive, knowing the cost will 
be my own life, but the part

as we curve around  into the loop of the city  circle, i can  see that a couple of the other 
stylists have tried to steal cinna and portia's idea of illuminating their tributes. the electric-
light-studded outfits  from  district  3,  where  they  make  electronics,  at  least  make  sense.  but 
what are the livestock keepers from district 10, who are dressed as cows, doing with flaming 
belts? broiling themselves? pathetic. 

peeta and i, on the other hand, are so mesmerizing with our ever-changing coal costumes 
that most of the other tributes are staring at us. we seem particularly riveting to the pair from

when effie eventually knocks on the door to summon me to dinner, i get up and take off 
my suit, fold it neatly, and set it on the table with my crown. in the bathroom, i wash the dark 
streaks of makeup from my face. i dress in a simple shirt and pants and go down the hall to 
the dining room. 

i'm  not aware of  much at dinner except that darius and the redheaded  avox girl are our 
servers.  effie,  haymitch,  cinna,  portia,  and  peeta  are  all  there,  talking  about  the  opening 
ceremonies,  i  suppose.  but the  only  time  i  really  feel  present  is  when  i  purposely  knock  a 
dish  of  peas  to  the  floor  and,  before  anyone  can  stop  me,  crouch  down  to  clean  them  up. 
darius is right by me when i send the dish over, and we two are briefly side by side, obscured 
from view, as we scoop up the peas. for just one moment our hands meet. i can feel his skin,

how ‚Äúthat isn't your job, katniss!‚Äù and he lets go. 

when we go in to watch the recap of the opening ceremonies, i wedge myself in between 
cinna  and haymitch on the couch  because i don't want to be next to peeta. this awfulness 
with darius belongs to me and gale and maybe even haymitch, but not to peeta. he might've 
known  darius to nod hello, but peeta wasn't hob the way the rest of us were. besides, i'm 
still angry with him for laughing at me along with the other victors, and the last thing i want 
is his sympathy and comfort. i haven't changed my mind about saving him in the arena, but i 
don't owe him more than that.

and  loaves of  bread. last  year we chattered away  about each contestant, but tonight there's 
only the occasional comment. small wonder the crowd goes wild when peeta and i appear, 
looking so young and strong and beautiful in our brilliant costumes. the very image of what 
tributes should be. 

as  soon  as  it's  over,  i  stand  up  and  thank  cinna  and  portia  for  their  amazing  work  and 
head  off  to  bed.  effie  calls  a  reminder  to  meet  early  for  breakfast  to  work out our training 
strategy, but even  her voice sounds  hollow. poor effie. she  finally  had a decent year  in the 
games with peeta and me, and now it's all broken down into a mess that even she can't put a 
positive spin on. in capitol terms, i'm guessing this counts as a true tragedy. 

soon after i go to bed, there's a quiet knock on my door, but i ignore

everybody else can do. or used to be able to do, anyway. so peeta and i will continue to act 
in  love  and  that's  that.  somehow  i'm  just  not  up to talking  about  it,  especially  with  darius 
standing mutely by. i take a long shower, dress slowly in the outfit cinna has left for training, 
and  order  food  from  the  menu  in  my  room  by  speaking  into  a  mouthpiece.  in  a  minute, 
sausage, eggs, potatoes, bread, juice, and hot chocolate appear. i eat my fill, trying to drag out 
the  minutes  until  ten  o'clock,  when  we  have  to  go  down  to  the  training  center.  by  nine-

dining  room  now!  still,  i  brush  my  teeth  before  meandering

‚Äúi'm not sure. i just wanted to hold them accountable, if only for a moment,‚Äù says peeta. 

‚Äúfor killing that little girl.‚Äù 

‚Äúthis  is  dreadful.‚Äù  effie  sounds  like  she's  about  to  cry.  ‚Äúthat  sort  of  thinking  ...  it's 

forbidden, peeta. absolutely. you'll only bring down more trouble on yourself and katniss.‚Äù 

‚Äúi  have to agree with effie on this one,‚Äù says haymitch. portia and cinna remain  silent, 
but  their  faces  are  very  serious.  of  course,  they're  right.  but  even  though  it  worries  me,  i 
think what he did was amazing. 

‚Äúi guess this is a bad time to mention i hung a dummy and painted seneca crane's name 
on  it,‚Äù i say. this  has the desired effect. after a moment of disbelief, all the disapproval  in 
the room hits me like a ton of bricks. 

‚Äúyou ... hung ... seneca crane?‚Äù says cinna. 

‚Äúyes. i was showing off my new knot-tying skills, and

‚Äúgood.  then  i  won't  be  responsible  for  you  killing  off  any  of  my  friends  with  your 

stupidity,‚Äù he says. 

‚Äúthat's just what we were thinking,‚Äù i tell him. 

we finish the meal in silence, but when we rise to go into the sitting room, cinna puts his 

arm around me and gives me a squeeze. ‚Äúcome on and let's go get those training scores.‚Äù 

we  gather  around  the  television  set  and  a  red-eyed  effie  rejoins  us.  the  tributes'  faces 
come up, district by district, and their scores flash under their pictures. one through twelve. 

predictably high scores for cashmere, gloss, brutus, enobaria, and finnick. low to medium 
for the rest. 

‚Äúhave they ever given a zero?‚Äù i ask. 

‚Äúno, but there's a first time for ever

and it turns out he's right. because when peeta and i each pull a twelve, we make hunger

‚Äúwhy did they do that?‚Äù i ask. 

‚Äúso  that the others  will  have  no  choice  but  to  target  you,‚Äù  says  haymitch  flatly.  ‚Äúgo  to 

bed. i can't stand to look at either one of you.‚Äù 

peeta walks me down to my room in silence, but before he can say good night, i wrap my 
arms  around  him  and  rest  my  head  against  hi

‚Äúi'm glad. i'm tired of making everyone around me so miserable,‚Äù says peeta. ‚Äúeverybody

we  stay  on  the  roof  until  bedtime  and  then  quietly  slip  down  to  my  room  without 

encountering anyone. 

the  next  morning,  we're  roused  by  my  prep  team.  the  sight  of  peeta  and  me  sleeping 
together  is too much  for octavia,  because she  bursts  into tears right away.  ‚Äúyou remember 
what cinna told us,‚Äù venia says fiercely. octavia nods and goes out sobbing. 

peeta has to return to his room  for prep, and i'm  left alone with venia and  flavius. the 
usual chatter has been suspended. in fact, there's little talk at all, other than to have me raise 
my chin or comment on a makeup technique. it's nearly lunch when i feel something dripping 
on  my  shoulder  and  turn  to  find  flavius,  who's  snipping  away  at  my  hair  with  silent  tears

then it's just venia, whose skin is so pale her tattoos appear to be leaping off it. almost 
rigid  with  determination,  she  does  my  hair  and  nails  and  makeup,  fingers  flying  swiftly  to 
compensate  for  her  absent teammates.  the  whole time,  she  avoids  my  gaze.  it's  only  when 
cinna shows up to approve me and dismiss her that she takes my hands, looks me straight in 
the eye, and says, ‚Äúwe would all like you to know what a ... privilege it has been to make you 
look your best.‚Äù then she hastens from the room. 

my prep team. my foolish, shallow, affectionate pets, with their obsessions with feathers 
and  parties,  nearly  break  my  heart  with  their  good-bye.  it's  certain  from  venia's  last  words 
that  we  all  know  i  won't  be  returning. does  the  whole

 world  know  it? i  wonder.  i  look  at 
cinna. he knows, certainly. but as he promised, there's no danger of tears from him. 

‚Äúso, what am i wearing tonight?‚Äù i ask, eyeing the garment bag that holds my dress. 

‚Äúpresident snow put in the dress order himself,‚Äù says cinna. he unzips the bag, revealing 
one of the wedding dresses i wore for the photo shoot. heavy white silk with a low neckline 
and  tight  waist  and  sleeves  that  fall  from  my  wrists  to  the  floor.  and  pearls.  everywhere 
pearls. stitched  into the dress and  in ropes at  my  throat  and forming the crown for the veil. 
‚Äúeven  though  they  announced  the  quarter  quell  the  night  of  the  photo  shoot,  people  still

ions were ignored.‚Äù 

i rub a bit of the silk between my fingers, trying to figure out president snow's reasoning. 
i suppose since i was the greatest offender, my pain and loss and humiliation should be in the 
brightest spotlight. this, he thinks, will make that clear. it's so barbaric, the president turning 
my  bridal  gown  into  my  shroud,  that  the  blow  strikes  home,  leaving  me  with  a  dull  ache 
inside. ‚Äúwell, it'd be a shame to waste such a pretty dress‚Äù is all i say. 

cinna  helps  me  carefully  into  the  gown.  as  it  settles  on  my  shoulders,  they  can't  help 
giving  a  shrug  of  complaint.  ‚Äúwas  it  always  this  heavy?‚Äù  i  ask.  i  remember  several  of  the 
dresses being dense, but this one feels like it weighs a ton. 

‚Äúi  had  to  make  some  slight  alterations  because  of  the  lighting,‚Äù  says  cinna.  i  nod,  but i 
can't  see  what  that  has  to  do  with  anything.  he  decks  me  out  in  the  shoes  and  the  pearl

‚Äúyou're ravishing,‚Äù he says.  ‚Äúnow, katniss, because this  bodice  is so fitted, i don't want 

you raising your arms above your head. well, not until you twirl, anyway.‚Äù 

‚Äúwill i be twirling again?‚Äù i ask, thinking of my dress last year. 

‚Äúi'm  sure caesar will  ask  you.  and  if  he doesn't,  you suggest  it  yourself. only  not right 

away. save it for your big finale,‚Äù cinna instructs me. 

‚Äúyou give me a signal so i know when,‚Äù i say. 

‚Äúall  right.  any  plans  for  your  interview?  i  know  haymitch  left  you  two  to  your  own 

devices,‚Äù he says. 

‚Äúno, this year i'm just winging it. the funny thing is, i'm not nervous at all.‚Äù and i'm not. 

however much president snow may hate me, this capitol audience is mine. 

we meet up with effie, haymitch, portia, and peeta at the elevator. peeta's in an elegant 
tuxedo and white gloves. the sort of thin

maybe it's old-fashioned, but no one really feels married in district 12 until after the toasting. 

the  other  tributes  have  already  gathered  offstage  and  are  talking  softly,  but  when  peeta 
and  i  arrive,  they  fall  silent.  i  realize  everyone's  staring  daggers  at  my  wedding  dress.  are 
they jealous of its beauty? the power it might have to manipulate the crowd? 

finally finnick says, ‚Äúi can't believe cinna put you in that thing.‚Äù 

‚Äúhe  didn't  have  any  choice.  president  snow  made  him,‚Äù  i  say,  somewhat  defensively.  i 

won't let anyone criticize cinna. 

cashmere tosses her flowing blond curls back and spits out, ‚Äúwell, you look ridiculous!‚Äù 
she grabs her brother's hand and pulls  him  into place to lead our procession onto the stage. 
the  other  tributes  begin  to  line  up  as  well.  i'm  confused  because,  while  they  all  are  angry, 
some  are  giving  us  sympathe

fessionalism showing some cracks as he tries to 
quiet them so i can speak, but my three minutes are ticking quickly away. 

finally there's a lull and he gets out, ‚Äúso, katniss, obviously this is a very emotional night 

for everyone. is there anything you'd like to say?‚Äù 

my voice trembles as i speak. ‚Äúonly that i'm so sorry you won't get to be at my wedding 
... but i'm glad you at least get to see me in my dress. isn't it just ... the most beautiful thing?‚Äù 
i don't have to look at cinna for a signal. i know this is the right time. i begin to twirl slowly, 
raising the sleeves of my heavy gown above my head. 

when i  hear the screams of the  crowd, i think  it's  because i  must  look stunning. then i 
notice something is rising up around me. smoke. from fire. not the flickery stuff i wore last 
year in the chariot, but something much more real that devours my dress. i begin to panic as 
the smoke thickens. charred bits of black silk swirl into the air, and pearls clatter to t

he stage. 
somehow i'm afraid to stop because my flesh doesn't seem to be burning and i know cinna 
must be  behind whatever  is  happening. so i keep spinning and spinning. for a split second 
i'm gasping, completely engulfed  in the strange  flames. then all at once, the  fire  is gone. i 
slowly come to a stop, wondering if i'm naked and why cinna has arranged to burn away my 
wedding dress. 

but  i'm  not  naked.  i'm  in  a  dress  of  the  exact  design  of  my  wedding  dress,  only  it's  the 
color of coal and made of tiny feathers. wonderingly, i lift my long, flowing sleeves into the 
air,  and  that's  when  i  see  myself  on  the  television  screen.  clothed  in  black  except  for  the 
white patches on my sleeves. or should i say my wings. 

because cinna has turned me into a mockingjay.

 flickers  across  caesar's  face,  and  i  can  tell  he  knows  that  the 
mockingjay isn't just my token. that it's come to symbolize so much more. that what will be 
seen  as  a  flashy  costume  change  in  the  capitol  is  resonating  in  an  entirely  different  way 
throughout the districts. but he makes the best of it. 

‚Äúwell,  hats  off  to  your  stylist.  i  don't  think  anyone  can  argue  that  that's  not  the  most 
spectacular  thing  we've  ever  seen  in  an  interview.  cinna,  i  think  you  better  take  a  bow!‚Äù 
caesar gestures for cinna to rise. he does, and makes a small, gracious bow. and suddenly i 
am so afraid for him. what has he done? something terribly dangerous. an act of rebellion in 
itself. and he's done it for me. i remember his words ... 

‚Äúdon't worry. i always channel my emotions into my work. that way i don't hurt anyone 

but myself.‚Äù 

...  and  i'm  afraid  he  has  hurt  himself  beyond  repair.  the  significance  of  my  fiery

‚Äúmaybe i'd think that, too, caesar,‚Äù says peeta bitterly, ‚Äúif it weren't for the baby.‚Äù 

there. he's done it again. dropped a bomb that wipes out the efforts of every tribute who 
came before him. well, maybe not. maybe this year he has only lit the fuse on a bomb that 
the  victors  themselves  have  been  building.  hoping  someone  would  be  able  to  detonate  it. 
perhaps  thinking  it  would  be  me  in  my  bridal  gown.  not  knowing  how  much  i  rely  on 
cinna's talents, whereas peeta needs nothing more than his wits. 

as the bomb explodes,  it sends accusations of  injustice and  barbarism and cruelty  flying 
out in every direction. even the most capitol-loving, games-hungry, bloodthirsty person out 
there can't ignore, at least for a moment, how horrific the whole thing is. 

i am pregnant. 

the  audience  can't  absorb  the  news  right  away.  it  has  to  strike  them  and  sink  in  and  be 
confirmed  by  other  voices  before  they  begin

r off the makeup and 
meet me in a few minutes, but i won't let him. i'm certain that if a door shuts between us, it 
will lock and i'll have to spend the night without him. besides, i have a shower in my room. i 
refuse to let go of his hand. 

do we sleep? i don't know. we spend the night holding each other, in some halfway land 
between  dreams  and  waking.  not  talking.  both  afraid  to  disturb  the  other  in  the  hope  that 
we'll be able to store up a few precious minutes of rest. 

cinna and portia arrive with the dawn, and i know peeta will have to go. tributes enter the 

arena alone. he gives me a light kiss. ‚Äúsee you soon,‚Äù he says. 

‚Äúsee you soon,‚Äù i answer. 

cinna, who will  help dress  me  for the games, accompanies  me to the roof. i'm about to 

mount the ladder to the hovercraft when i remember. ‚Äúi didn't say good-bye to portia.‚Äù 

‚Äúi'll tell her,‚Äù says cinna. 

the electric  current  freezes  me  in place on the  ladder until the doctor  injects the

into my left forearm. now they will always be able to locate me in the arena. the hovercraft 
takes  off,  and  i  look out the  windows  until  they  black  out.  cinna  keeps  pressing  me  to  eat 
and,  when  that  fails,  to  drink.  i  manage  to  keep  sipping  water,  thinking  of  the  days  of 

dehydration that almost killed me last year. thinking of how i will need my strength to keep 
peeta alive. 

when we reach the launch room at the arena, i shower. cinna braids my hair down my 
back and helps me dress over simple undergarments. this year's tribute outfit is a fitted blue 
jumpsuit, made of very sheer material, that zippers up the front. a six-inch-wide padded belt 
covered in shiny purple plastic. a pair of nylon shoes with rubber soles. 

‚Äúwhat do you think?‚Äù i ask, holding the fabric out for cinna to examine. 

he frowns as he rubs the thin stuff between his fingers. ‚Äúi don't know. it will offer little in

‚Äúsun?‚Äù i ask, picturing a burning sun over a barren desert. 

‚Äúpossibly.  if  it's  been  treated,‚Äù  he  says.  ‚Äúoh,  i  almost  forgot  this.‚Äù  he  takes  my  gold 

mockingjay pin from his pocket and fixes it to the jumpsuit. 

‚Äúmy  dress  was  fantastic  last  night,‚Äù  i  say.  fantastic  and  reckless.  but  cinna  must  know 

that. 

‚Äúi thought you might like it,‚Äù he says with a tight smile. 

we sit, as we did last year, holding hands until the voice tells me to prepare for the launch. 
he walks me over to the circular metal plate and zips up the neck of my jumpsuit securely. 
‚Äúremember, girl on fire,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúi'm still betting on you.‚Äù he kisses my forehead and steps 
back as the glass cylinder slides down around me. 

‚Äúthank  you,‚Äù i say, although  he probably can't hear me. i lift

  my chin, holding  my  head 
high the way he always tells me to, and wait for the plate to rise. but it doesn't. and it still 
doesn't. 

i  look  at  cinna,  raising  my  eyebrows  for  an  explanation.  he  just  gives  his  head  a  slight 

shake, as perplexed as i am. why are they delaying this? 

suddenly the door behind  him  bursts open and three peacekeepers spring  into the room. 
two pin cinna's arms  behind  him and cuff  him  while the third  hits  him  in the temple with 
such  force  he's knocked to his knees. but they keep hitting  him with  metal-studded gloves, 
opening gashes on his face and body. i'm screaming my head off, banging on the unyielding 
glass, trying to reach him. the peacekeepers ignore me completely as they drag cinna's limp 
body from the room. all that's left are the smears of blood on the floor. 

sickened and terrified, i feel the plate begin to rise. i'm

i can only form one clear thought. 

this is no place for a girl on fire.

‚Äúthe enemy‚Äù 

 

‚Äúladies and gentlemen, let the seventy-fifth hunger games begin!‚Äù the voice of claudius 
templesmith, the hunger games announcer, hammers my ears. i have less than a minute to 
get  my  bearings.  then  the  gong  will  sound  and  the  tributes  will  be  free  to  move  o ff  their 
metal plates. but move where? 

i can't think straight. the image of cinna, beaten and bloody, consumes me. where is he 
now? what are they doing to him? torturing him? killing him? turning him into an avox? 
obviously  his  assault  was  staged  to  unhinge  me,  the  same  way  darius's  presence  in  my 
quarters was. and it has unhinged me. all i want to do is collapse on my metal plate. but i 
can hardly do that after what i just witnessed. i must be strong. i owe it to cinna, who risked 
everything  by  undermining  president  snow  and  turning  my  bridal  sil

plumage. and i owe it to the rebels who, emboldened by cinna's example, might be fighting 
to  bring  down  the  capitol  at  this  moment.  my  refusal  to  play  the  games  on  the  capitol's 
terms is to be my last act of rebellion. so i grit my teeth and will myself to be a player. 

where are you? i can still make no sense of my surroundings. where are you?! i demand 
an answer from myself and slowly the world comes into focus. blue water. pink sky. white-
hot  sun  beating  down.  all  right, there's  the  cornucopia,  the  shining  gold  metal  h

ther, it's hard to imagine president snow will overlook it, and 
that makes the job of keeping peeta alive harder. 

‚Äúso you want to make camp here, then?‚Äù finnick asks. 

‚Äúi  don't  think  that's  an  option,‚Äù  peeta  answers.  ‚Äústaying  here.  with  no  water.  no 

protection. i feel all right, really. if we could just go slowly.‚Äù 

‚Äúslowly would be better than not at all.‚Äù finnick helps peeta to his feet while i pull myself 
together. since i got up this morning i've watched cinna beaten to a pulp, landed in another 
arena,  and  seen  peeta  die.  still,  i'm  glad  finnick  keeps  playing  the  pregnancy  card  for  me, 
because from a sponsor's point of view, i'm not handling things all that well. 

i  check  over  my  weapons,  which  i  know  are  in  perfect  condition,  because  it  makes  me 

seem more in control. ‚Äúi'll take the lead,‚Äù i announce. 

peeta starts to object but finnick cuts him off. ‚Äúno, let her do it.‚Äù he frowns at me. ‚Äúyou

i stretch out, pressing my hot cheek on the grass mat, staring at the thing in aggravation. 
peeta rubs a tense spot between my shoulders and i let myself relax a little. i wonder why this 
place  hasn't cooled off at all  now that the sun's gone down. i wonder what's going on  back 
home. 

prim. my mother. gale. madge. i think of them watching me from home. at least i hope 
they're at home. not taken into custody by thread. being punished as cinna is. as darius is. 
punished because of me. everybody. 

i  begin  to  ache  for  them,  for  my  district,  for  my  woods.  a  decent  woods  with  sturdy 
hardwood  trees,  plentiful  food,  game  that  isn't  creepy.  rushing  streams.  cool  breezes.  no, 
cold  winds  to  blow  this  stifling  heat  away.  i  conjure  up  such  a  wind  in  my  mind,  letting  it 
freeze my cheeks and numb my fingers, and all at once, the piece of metal half buried in the 
black earth has a name.
