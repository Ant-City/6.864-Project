Queen Guinevere - 
  Arthur's wife. The beautiful young Guinevere of Sir
Gawain and the Green Knight seems to have little in common
with the one of later Arthurian legend. She sits next to Gawain
at the New Year's feast and remains a silent, objectified presence
in the midst of the knights of the Round Table.
