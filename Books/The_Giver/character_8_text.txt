k, and put on the volunteer's smock that was folded on a shelf.

"hi, jonas!" asher called from the corner where he was kneeling
beside a tub. jonas saw fiona nearby, at a different tub. she
looked up and smiled at him, but she was busy, gently washing a
man who lay in the warm water.

jonas greeted them and the caretaking attendants at work nearby.
then he went to the row of padded lounging chairs where others of
the old were waiting. he had worked here before; he knew what to
do.

"your turn, larissa," he said, reading the nametag on





the woman's robe. "i'll just start the water and then help you up." he
pressed the button on a nearby empty tub and watched as the
warm water flowed in through the many small openings on the
sides. the tub would be filled in a minute and the water flow would
stop automatically.

he helped the woman from the chair, led her to the tub, removed
her robe, and steadied her with his hand on her arm as she
stepped in and lowered herself. she leaned back and sighe

apology if one had by mistake glimpsed another's body was always
awkward. he couldn't see why it was necessary. he liked the
feeling of safety here in this warm and quiet room; he liked the
expression of trust on the woman's face as she lay in the water
unprotected, exposed, and free.

from the corner of his eye he could see his friend fiona






help the old man from the tub and tenderly pat his thin, naked body
dry with an absorbant cloth. she helped him into his robe.

jonas thought larissa had drifted into sleep, as the old often did,
and he was careful to keep his motions steady and gentle so he
wouldn't wake her. he was surprised when she spoke, her eyes still
closed.

"this morning we celebrated the release of roberto," she told him.
"it was wonderful."

"i knew roberto!" jonas said. "i helped with his feeding the last
time i was here, just a few weeks ago. he was a very interesting
man."

larissa opened her eyes happily. "they told his whole life before
they released him," sh

little boring. i've even seen some of the old fall asleep during
tellings- when they released edna recently. did you know edna?"

jonas shook his head. he couldn't recall anyone named edna.

"well, they tried to make her life sound meaningful. and of course,"
she added primly, "all lives are meaningful, i don't mean that they
aren't. but edna. my goodness. she was a birthmother, and then
she worked in food production for years, until she came here. she
never even had a family unit."

larissa lifted her head and looked around to make sure no one else
was listening. then she confided, "i don't think edna was very
smart."

jonas laughed. he rinsed her left arm, laid it back into the water,
and began to wash her feet. she murmured



with pleasure as he massaged her feet with the sponge.

"but roberto's life was wonderful," larissa went on, after a
moment. "he had been an instructor of elevens --you know how
important that is--and he'd been on the planning committee. and-

shoulders. "tell me about the celebration."

"well, there was the telling of his life. that is always first. then the
toast. we all raised our glasses and cheered. we chanted the
anthem. he made a lovely goodbye speech. and several of us
made little speeches wishing him well. i didn't, though. i've never
been fond of public speaking.

"he was thrilled. you should have seen the look on his face when
they let him go."

jonas slowed the strokes of his hand on her back thoughtfully.
"larissa," he asked, "what happens when they make the actual
release? where exactly did roberto go?"

she lifted her bare wet shoulders in a small shrug. "i don't know. i
don't think anybody does, except the committee. .he just bowed to
all of us and then walked, like they all do, through the special door
in the releasing room. but you should have seen his look. pure
happiness, i'd call it."





jonas grinned. "i wish i'd been there to see it."

larissa frowned. "i don't know why they don't let childre

enough room, i guess. they should enlarge the releasing room."



"we'll have to suggest that to the committee. maybe they'd study it,"
jonas said slyly, and larissa chortled with laughter.

"right.!" she hooted, and jonas helped her from the tub.

usually, at the morning ritual when the family members told their
dreams, jonas didn't contribute much. he rarely dreamed.
sometimes he awoke with a feeling of fragments afloat in his sleep,
but he couldn't seem to grasp them and put them together into
something worthy of telling at the ritual.

but this morning was different. he had dreamed very vividly the
night before.

his mind wandered while lily, as

jonas, listening, thought suddenly about the bridge and how,
standing there, he had wondered what lay elsewhere.

was there someone there, waiting, who would receive the tiny
released twin? would it grow up elsewhere, not knowing, ever, that
in this community lived a being who looked exactly the same?

for a moment he felt a tiny, fluttering hope that he knew was quite
foolish. he hoped that it would be larissa, waiting. larissa, the old
woman he had bathed. he remembered her sparkling eyes, her soft
voice, her low chuckle. fiona had told him recently that larissa had
been released at a wonderful ceremony.

but he knew that the old were not given children to raise. larissa's
life elsewhere would be quiet and serene as befit the old; she
would not welcome the responsibility of nurturing a newchild who
needed feeding and care, and would likely cry at night.




"mother? father?" he said, the idea coming
