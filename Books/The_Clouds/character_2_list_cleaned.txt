[CHARACTER] - 
      the master-sophist at the infamous school. [CHARACTER] is a spokesman for the "new education" of rhetoric, atheism, science, and sophistry. he represents the heights of esoteric knowledge--so removed from the reality of everyday life in athens as to appear floating! in contrast to the brutish physicality of strepsiades, [CHARACTER] represents pure, rarified intellect at its most ethereal and impractical. however, [CHARACTER] is not "above" human emotions such as anger and impatience, especially when plagued with such a buffoonish student as strepsiades.
