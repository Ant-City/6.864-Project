  her mother leda's present, when she came
  to ruin troy and set the world on flame;
  the scepter priam's eldest daughter bore,
  her orient necklace, and the crown she wore
  of double texture, glorious to behold,
  one order set with gems, and one with gold.
  instructed thus, the wise achates goes,
  and in his diligence his duty shows.

  but venus, anxious for her son's affairs,
  new counsels tries, and new designs prepares:
  that cupid should assume the shape and face
  of sweet ascanius, and the sprightly grace;
  should bring the presents, in her nephew's stead,
  and in eliza's veins the gentle poison shed:
  for much she fear'd the tyrians, double-tongued,
  and knew the town to juno's care belong'd.
  these thoughts by night her golden slumbers broke,
  and thus alarm'd, to winged love she spoke:
  "my son, my strength, whose mighty pow'r alone
  controls the thund'rer on his awful throne,
  to thee thy much-afflicted mother flies,
  and on thy succor and thy faith relies.

  thou know'st, my son, how jove's revengeful wife,
  by force and fraud, attempts thy brother's life;
  and often hast thou mourn'd with me his pains.
  him dido now with blandishment detains;
  but i suspect the town where juno reigns.
  for this 't is needful to prevent her art,
  and fire with love the proud phoenician's heart:
  a love so violent, so strong, so sure,
  as neither age can change, nor art can cure.
  how this may be perform'd, now take my mind:
  ascanius by his father is design'd
  to come, with presents laden, from the port,
  to gratify the queen, and gain the court.
  i mean to plunge the boy in pleasing sleep,
  and, ravish'd, in idalian bow'rs to keep,
  or high cythera, that the sweet deceit
  may pass unseen, and none prevent the cheat.
  take thou his form and shape. i beg the grace
  but only for a night's revolving space:
  thyself a boy, assume a boy's dissembled face;
  that when, amidst the fervor of the feast,
  the tyrian hugs an

  and with sweet kisses in her arms constrains,

  the god of love obeys, and sets aside
  his bow and quiver, and his plumy pride;
  he walks iulus in his mother's sight,
  and in the sweet resemblance takes delight.

  the goddess then to young ascanius flies,
  and in a pleasing slumber seals his eyes:
  lull'd in her lap, amidst a train of loves,
  she gently bears him to her blissful groves,
  then with a wreath of myrtle crowns his head,
  and softly lays him on a flow'ry bed.
  cupid meantime assum'd his form and face,
  foll'wing achates with a shorter pace,
  and brought the gifts. the queen already sate
  amidst the trojan lords, in shining state,
  high on a golden bed: her princely guest
  was next her side; in order sate the rest.

  not her own star confess'd a light so clear:
  great in her charms, as when on gods above
  she looks, and breathes herself into their love.
  she held my hand, the destin'd blow to break;
  then from her rosy lips began to speak:
  'my son, from whence this madness, this neglect
  of my commands, and those whom i protect?
  why this unmanly rage? recall to mind
  whom you forsake, what pledges leave behind.
  look if your helpless father yet survive,
  or if ascanius or creusa live.
  around your house the greedy grecians err;
  and these had perish'd in the nightly war,
  but for my presence and protecting care.
  not helen's face, nor paris, was in fault;
  but by the gods was this destruction brought.
  now cast your eyes around, while i dissolve
  the mists and films that mortal eyes involve,

  of dire debate, and blood in battle spilt.'
  thus, ord'ring all that prudence could provide,
  i clothe my shoulders with a lion's hide
  and yellow spoils; then, on my bending back,

  for still she begs to hear it once again.
  the hearer on the speaker's mouth depends,
  and thus the tragic story never ends.

  then, when they part, when phoebe's paler light
  withdraws, and falling stars to sleep invite,
  she last remains, when ev'ry guest is gone,
  sits on the bed he press'd, and sighs alone;
  absent, her absent hero sees and hears;
  or in her bosom young ascanius bears,
  and seeks the father's image in the child,
  if love by likeness might be so beguil'd.

  meantime the rising tow'rs are at a stand;
  no labors exercise the youthful band,
  nor use of arts, nor toils of arms they know;
  the mole is left unfinish'd to the foe;
  the mounds, the works, the walls, neglected lie,

  the brawny guards in martial order stand.
  a flow'r'd simar with golden fringe she wore,
  and at her back a golden quiver bore;
  her flowing hair a golden caul restrains,
  a golden clasp the tyrian robe sustains.
  then young ascanius, with a sprightly grace,
  leads on the trojan youth to view the chase.
  but far above the rest in beauty shines
  the great aeneas, the troop he joins;
  like fair apollo, when he leaves the frost

  when to his native delos he resorts,

  now had they reach'd the hills, and storm'd the seat
  of salvage beasts, in dens, their last retreat.
  the cry pursues the mountain goats: they bound
  from rock to rock, and keep the craggy ground;
  quite otherwise the stags, a trembling train,
  in herds unsingled, scour the dusty plain,
  and a long chase in open view maintain.
  the glad ascanius, as his courser guides,

  his horse's flanks and sides are forc'd to feel
  the clanking lash, and goring of the steel.

  wishing some nobler beast to cross his way,
  and rather would the tusky boar attend,
  or see the tawny lion downward bend.

  who sways the world below and heav'n above,
  has sent me down with this severe command:
  what means thy ling'ring in the libyan land?
  if glory cannot move a mind so mean,
  nor future praise from flitting pleasure wean,
  regard the fortunes of thy rising heir:
  the promis'd crown let young ascanius wear,
  to whom th' ausonian scepter, and the state
  of rome's imperial name is ow'd by fate."
  so spoke the god; and, speaking, took his flight,
  involv'd in clouds, and vanish'd out of sight.

  the pious prince was seiz'd with sudden fear;
  mute was his tongue, and upright stood his hair.
  revolving in his mind the stern command,
  he longs to fly, and loathes the charming land.
  what should he say? or how should he begin?

  if you, a tyrian, and a stranger born,

  why may not we- like you, a foreign race-
  like you, seek shelter in a foreign place?
  as often as the night obscures the skies
  with humid shades, or twinkling stars arise,
  anchises' angry ghost in dreams appears,
  chides my delay, and fills my soul with fears;
  and young ascanius justly may complain
  of his defrauded and destin'd reign.
  ev'n now the herald of the gods appear'd:
  waking i saw him, and his message heard.
  from jove he came commission'd, heav'nly bright
  with radiant beams, and manifest to sight
  (the sender and the sent i both attest)
  these walls he enter'd, and those words express'd.

  he said, and first his brows with myrtle bound.

  his temples tied, and all the trojan race.

  he said; and, calling out, the cirque he clears.

  and march together in a friendly line.
  and, as the cretan labyrinth of old,
  with wand'ring ways and many a winding fold,
  involv'd the weary feet, without redress,
  in a round error, which denied recess;
  so fought the trojan boys in warlike play,
  turn'd and return'd, and still a diff'rent way.
  thus dolphins in the deep each other chase
  in circles, when they swim around the wat'ry race.
  this game, these carousels, ascanius taught;
  and, building alba, to the latins brought;
  shew'd what he learn'd: the latin sires impart
  to their succeeding sons the graceful art;
  from these imperial rome receiv'd the game,
  which troy, the youths the trojan troop, they name.

  ascanius took th' alarm, while yet he led
  his early warriors on his prancing steed,
  and, spurring on, his equals soon o'erpass'd;
  nor could his frighted friends reclaim his haste.
  soon as the royal youth appear'd in view,
  he sent his voice before him as he flew:
  "what madness moves you, matrons, to destroy
  the last remainders of unhappy troy!

  and on your friends your fatal fury turn.

  beneath a shady tree, the hero spread
  his table on the turf, with cakes of bread;
  and, with his chiefs, on forest fruits he fed.
  they sate; and, (not without the god's command,)
  their homely fare dispatch'd, the hungry band
  invade their trenchers next, and soon devour,
  to mend the scanty meal, their cakes of flour.
  ascanius this observ'd, and smiling said:
  "see, we devour the plates on which we fed."
  the speech had omen, that the trojan race
  should find repose, and this the time and place.
  aeneas took the word, and thus replies,
  confessing fate with wonder in his eyes:
  "all hail, o earth! all hail, my household gods!

  which overlooks the vale with wide command;
  where fair ascanius and his youthful train,
  with horns and hounds, a hunting match ordain,
  and pitch their toils around the shady plain.
  the fury fires the pack; they snuff, they vent,
  and feed their hungry nostrils with the scent.

  this household beast, that us'd the woodland grounds,
  was view'd at first by the young hero's hounds,
  as down the stream he swam, to seek retreat

  then into tears of joy the father broke;
  each in his longing arms by turns he took;
  panted and paus'd; and thus again he spoke:
  "ye brave young men, what equal gifts can we,
  in recompense of such desert, decree?
  the greatest, sure, and best you can receive,
  the gods and your own conscious worth will give.
  the rest our grateful gen'ral will bestow,
  and young ascanius till his manhood owe."

  "and i, whose welfare in my father lies,"
  ascanius adds, "by the great deities,

  by hoary vesta's rites and dark abodes,
  adjure you both, (on you my fortune stands;
  that and my faith i plight into your hands,)

  he said. the mov'd assistants melt in tears.

  then thus ascanius, wonderstruck to see
  that image of his filial piety:
  "so great beginnings, in so green an age,
  exact the faith which i again ingage.
  thy mother all the dues shall justly claim,
  creusa had, and only want the name.

he said, and weeping, while he spoke the word,
  from his broad belt he drew a shining sword,
  magnificent with gold. lycaon made,
  and in an ivory scabbard sheath'd the blade.
  this was his gift. great mnestheus gave his friend
  a lion's hide, his body to defend;
  and good alethes furnish'd him, beside,
  with his own trusty helm, of temper tried.

  thus arm'd they went. the noble trojans wait
  their issuing forth, and follow to the gate
  with prayers and vows. above the rest appears
  ascanius, manly far beyond his years,
  and messages committed to their care,
  which all in winds were lost, and flitting air.

  the trenches first they pass'd; then took their way
  where their proud foes in pitch'd pavilions lay;
  to many fatal, ere themselves were slain.
  they found the careless host dispers'd upon the plain,
  who, gorg'd, and drunk with wine, supinely snore.

  her shrieks and clamors pierce the trojans' ears,
  unman their courage, and augment their fears;
  nor young ascanius could the sight sustain,
  nor old ilioneus his tears restrain,
  but actor and idaeus jointly sent,
  to bear the madding mother to her tent.

  and now the trumpets terribly, from far,
  with rattling clangor, rouse the sleepy war.
  the soldiers' shouts succeed the brazen sounds;
  and heav'n, from pole to pole, the noise rebounds.
  the volscians bear their shields upon their head,
  and, rushing forward, form a moving shed.

  him when he spied from far, the tuscan king
  laid by the lance, and took him to the sling,
  thrice whirl'd the thong around his head, and threw:
  the heated lead half melted as it flew;
  it pierc'd his hollow temples and his brain;
  the youth came tumbling down, and spurn'd the plain.

  then young ascanius, who, before this day,
  was wont in woods to shoot the savage prey,
  first bent in martial strife the twanging bow,
  and exercis'd against a human foe-
  with this bereft numanus of his life,
  who turnus' younger sister took to wife.
  proud of his realm, and of his royal bride,
  vaunting before his troops, and lengthen'd with a stride,
  in these insulting terms the trojans he defied:

  "twice-conquer'd cowards, now your shame is shown-
  coop'd up a second time within your town!

 your vests embroider'd with rich purple shine;
  in sloth you glory, and in dances join.
  your vests have sweeping sleeves; with female pride
  your turbants underneath your chins are tied.
  go, phrygians, to your dindymus again!
  go, less than women, in the shapes of men!
  go, mix'd with eunuchs, in the mother's rites,
  where with unequal sound the flute invites;
  sing, dance, and howl, by turns, in ida's shade:
  resign the war to men, who know the martial trade!"

  this foul reproach ascanius could not hear
  with patience, or a vow'd revenge forbear.
  at the full stretch of both his hands he drew,
  and almost join'd the horns of the tough yew.
  but, first, before the throne of jove he stood,
  and thus with lifted hands invok'd the god:
  "my first attempt, great jupiter, succeed!
  an annual off'ring in thy grove shall bleed;
  a snow-white steer, before thy altar led,
  who, like his mother, bears aloft his head,
  butts with his threat'ning brows, and bellowing stands,

dares the fight, and spurns the yellow sands."

  jove bow'd the heav'ns, and lent a gracious ear,
  and thunder'd on the left, amidst the clear.
  sounded at once the bow; and swiftly flies
  the feather'd death, and hisses thro' the skies.
  the steel thro' both his temples forc'd the way:
  extended on the ground, numanus lay.
  "go now, vain boaster, and true valor scorn!
  the phrygians, twice subdued, yet make this third return."
  ascanius said no more. the trojans shake
  the heav'ns with shouting, and new vigor take.

  apollo then bestrode a golden cloud,
  to view the feats of arms, and fighting crowd;
  and thus the beardless victor he bespoke aloud:
  "advance, illustrious youth, increase in fame,
  and wide from east to west extend thy name;
  offspring of gods thyself; and rome shall owe
  to thee a race of demigods below.
  this is the way to heav'n: the pow'rs divine
  from this beginning date the julian line.

, to them, and their victorious heirs,
  the conquer'd war is due, and the vast world is theirs.
  troy is too narrow for thy name." he said,
  and plunging downward shot his radiant head;
  dispell'd the breathing air, that broke his flight:
  shorn of his beams, a man to mortal sight.
  old butes' form he took, anchises' squire,
  now left, to rule ascanius, by his sire:
  his wrinkled visage, and his hoary hairs,
  his mien, his habit, and his arms, he wears,
  and thus salutes the boy, too forward for his years:
  "suffice it thee, thy father's worthy son,
  the warlike prize thou hast already won.
  the god of archers gives thy youth a part
  of his own praise, nor envies equal art.
  now tempt the war no more." he said, and flew
  obscure in air, and vanish'd from their view.

exalts my mind;
  (such hopes i had indeed, while heav'n was kind;)
  now let my happier foes possess my place,
  whom jove prefers before the trojan race;
  and conquer they, whom you with conquest grace.
  since you can spare, from all your wide command,
  no spot of earth, no hospitable land,
  which may my wand'ring fugitives receive;
  (since haughty juno will not give you leave;)
  then, father, (if i still may use that name,)
  by ruin'd troy, yet smoking from the flame,
  i beg you, let ascanius, by my care,
  be freed from danger, and dismiss'd the war:
  inglorious let him live, without a crown.
  the father may be cast on coasts unknown,
  struggling with fate; but let me save the son.
  mine is cythera, mine the cyprian tow'rs:
  in those recesses, and those sacred bow'rs,
  obscurely let him rest; his right resign
  to promis'd empire, and his julian line.
  then carthage may th' ausonian towns destroy,
  nor fear the race of a rejected boy.

  till turnus, as at anchor fix'd we stood,
  presum'd to violate our holy wood.
  then, loos'd from shore, we fled his fires profane
  (unwillingly we broke our master's chain),
  and since have sought you thro' the tuscan main.
  the mighty mother chang'd our forms to these,
  and gave us life immortal in the seas.
  but young ascanius, in his camp distress'd,
  by your insulting foes is hardly press'd.
  th' arcadian horsemen, and etrurian host,
  advance in order on the latian coast:
  to cut their way the daunian chief designs,
  before their troops can reach the trojan lines.
  thou, when the rosy morn restores the light,
  first arm thy soldiers for th' ensuing fight:

  thus much he spoke, and more he would have said;
  but the stern hero turn'd aside his head,
  and cut him short: "i hear another man;
  you talk'd not thus before the fight began.
  now take your turn; and, as a brother should,
  attend your brother to the stygian flood."
  then thro' his breast his fatal sword he sent,
  and the soul issued at the gaping vent.

  as storms the skies, and torrents tear the ground,
  thus rag'd the prince, and scatter'd deaths around.
  at length ascanius and the trojan train
  broke from the camp, so long besieg'd in vain.

  meantime the king of gods and mortal man
  held conference with his queen, and thus began:
  "my sister goddess, and well-pleasing wife,
  still think you venus' aid supports the strife-
  sustains her trojans- or themselves, alone,
  with inborn valor force their fortune on?
  how fierce in fight, with courage undecay'd!
  judge if such warriors want immortal aid."

  shall view the fun'ral honors of his son.
  these are my triumphs of the latian war,
  fruits of my plighted faith and boasted care!
  and yet, unhappy sire, thou shalt not see
  a son whose death disgrac'd his ancestry;
  thou shalt not blush, old man, however griev'd:
  thy pallas no dishonest wound receiv'd.
  he died no death to make thee wish, too late,
  thou hadst not liv'd to see his shameful fate:
  but what a champion has th' ausonian coast,
  and what a friend hast thou, ascanius, lost!"

  thus having mourn'd, he gave the word around,
  to raise the breathless body from the ground;
  and chose a thousand horse, the flow'r of all
  his warlike troops, to wait the funeral,
  to bear him back and share evander's grief:
  a well-becoming, but a weak relief.
  of oaken twigs they twist an easy bier,
  then on their shoulders the sad burden rear.
  the body on this rural hearse is borne:
  strew'd leaves and funeral greens the bier adorn.

  or, if it were, discharge the crime on me."
  she said, and, sailing on the winged wind,
  left the sad nymph suspended in her mind.

  and now pomp the peaceful kings appear:
  four steeds the chariot of latinus bear;
  twelve golden beams around his temples play,
  to mark his lineage from the god of day.
  two snowy coursers turnus' chariot yoke,
  and in his hand two massy spears he shook:
  then issued from the camp, in arms divine,
  aeneas, author of the roman line;
  and by his side ascanius took his place,
  the second hope of rome's immortal race.
  adorn'd in white, a rev'rend priest appears,
  and off'rings to the flaming altars bears;
  a porket, and a lamb that never suffer'd shears.
  then to the rising sun he turns his eyes,
  and strews the beasts, design'd for sacrifice,
  with salt and meal: with like officious care
  he marks their foreheads, and he clips their hair.
  betwixt their horns the purple wine he sheds;
  with the same gen'rous juice the flame he feeds.

  against his threat'ning foe his ample shield;
  then call'd for aid: but, while he cried in vain,
  the chariot bore him backward on the plain.
  he lies revers'd; the victor king descends,
  and strikes so justly where his helmet ends,
  he lops the head. the latian fields are drunk
  with streams that issue from the bleeding trunk.

  while he triumphs, and while the trojans yield,
  the wounded prince is forc'd to leave the field:
  strong mnestheus, and achates often tried,
  and young ascanius, weeping by his side,
  conduct him to his tent. scarce can he rear
  his limbs from earth, supported on his spear.
  resolv'd in mind, regardless of the smart,
  he tugs with both his hands, and breaks the dart.
  the steel remains. no readier way he found
  to draw the weapon, than t' inlarge the wound.
  eager of fight, impatient of delay,
  he begs; and his unwilling friends obey.
