[CHARACTER] - 
  [CHARACTER] attempts to seduce gawain on a daily
basis during his stay at the castle. though the poem presents her
to the reader as no more than a beautiful young woman, bertilak's
wife is an amazingly clever debater and an astute reader of gawain's responses
as she argues her way through three attempted seductions. flirtatious
and intelligent, [CHARACTER] ultimately turns out to be another
pawn in morgan le faye's plot.
