ber of peaks and troughs in the particular vibrational pattern), while the whole
number multiple is determined by the amplitude of the vibrational pattern.

the  key  point  for  the  present  discussion  is  this:  since  the  minimal  energy  denominations  are
proportional  to  the  string's  tension,  and  since  this  tension  is  enormous,  the  fundamental  minimal
energies are, on the usual scales of elementary particle physics, similarly huge. they are multiples of
what is known as the planck energy. to get a sense of scale, if we translate the planck energy into a

mass using einstein's famous conversion formula e = mc2, they correspond to masses that are on the
order  of  ten  billion  billion  (1019)  times  that  of  a  proton.  this  gargantuan  mass—by  elementary
particle standards—is known as the planck mass; it's about equal to the mass of a grain of dust or a
collection of a million average bacteria. and so, the typical mass-equivalent of a vibrating loop in
string theory is

antum vibration. the remarkable thing, as
originally worked out in the 1970s, is that there can be energy cancellations between these quantum
jitters and the more intuitive kind of string vibrations discussed above and illustrated in figures 6.2
and  6.3.  in  effect,  through  the  weirdness  of  quantum  mechanics,  the  energy  associated  with  the
quantum jitters of a string is negative, and this reduces the overall energy content of a vibrating string
by an amount that is roughly equal to planck energy. this means that the lowest-energy vibrational
string patterns, whose energies we would naively expect to be about equal to the planck energy(i.e., 1
times the planck energy), are largely canceled, thereby yielding relatively low net-energy vibrations
—energies whose corresponding mass-equivalents are in the neighborhood of the matter and force
particle masses shown in tables 1.1 and 1.2. it is these lowest energy vibrational patterns, therefore,
that  should  provide  contact  between  the

int, however, is that the high
string tension ensures that all but a few of these vibrational patterns will correspond to extremely
heavy particles (the few being the lowest-energy vibrations that have near-perfect cancellations with
quantum string jitters). and again, the term "heavy" here means many times heavier than the planck
mass. as our most powerful particle accelerators can reach energies only on the order of a thousand
times the proton mass, less than a millionth of a billionth of the planck energy, we are very far from
being able to search in the laboratory for any of these new particles predicted by string theory.

there are more indirect approaches by which we could search for them, though. for instance,
the  energies  involved  at  the  birth  of  the  universe  would  have  been  high  enough  to  produce  these
particles copiously. in general one would not expect them to survive to the present day, as such super-
heavy particles are usually unstable, relinquishing their enormous mas

rrying  out  research  with  great  precision,  their  conclusions  do  not  agree.  george
claims that the circular radius is r = 10 times the planck length, while gracie claims that the circular
radius is r = 1/10 times the planck length.

"gracie,"  says  george,  "based  on  my  string  theory  calculations,  i  know  that  if  the  circular

dimension has radius 10, then i should expect to see strings whose energies are listed in table 10.1. i
have done extensive experiments using the new planck energy accelerator and they have revealed that
this prediction is precisely confirmed. therefore, with confidence, i claim that the circular dimension
has radius r = 10." gracie, in defense of her claims, makes exactly the same remarks except for her
conclusion that the list of energies in table 10.2 is found, confirming that the radius is r = 1/10.

in a flash of insight, gracie shows george that the two tables, although arranged differently, are
actually  identical.  now  george,  who,  as  is  well

ever  earlier  times.  since  the  universe  gets  ever  smaller,  hotter,  and  denser  as  we  push  back,  an
accurate quantum-mechanical description of matter and the forces becomes increasingly important. as
we have seen from other viewpoints in earlier chapters, point-particle quantum field theory works
until typical particle energies are around the planck energy. in a cosmological context, this occurred
when the whole of the known universe fit within a planck-sized nugget, yielding a density so great that
it strains one's ability to find a fitting metaphor or an enlightening analogy: the density of the universe
at  the  planck  time  was  simply colossal.  at  such  energies  and  densities  gravity  and  quantum
mechanics can no longer be treated as two separate entities as they are in point-particle quantum field
theory. instead, the central message
