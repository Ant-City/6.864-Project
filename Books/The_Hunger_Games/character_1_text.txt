an exciting day!â€ 
she warbles as she attempts to straighten her wig, which has 
listed severely to the right. â€œbut more excitement to come! itâ€™s 
time to choose our boy tribute!â€ clearly hoping to contain her 
tenuous hair situation, she plants one hand on her head as she 
crosses to the ball that contains the boysâ€™ names and grabs the 
first slip she encounters. she zips back to the podium, and i 
donâ€™t even have time to wish for galeâ€™s safety when sheâ€™s read-
ing the name. â€œpeeta mellark.â€ 
peeta mellark! 
oh, no, i think. not him. because i recognize this name, al-
though i have never spoken directly to its owner. peeta mel-
lark. no, the odds are not in my favor today. i watch him as he 
makes his way toward the stage. medium height, stocky build, 
ashy blond hair that falls in waves over

his forehead. the shock of the moment is registering on his 
face, you can see his struggle to remain emotionless, but his 
blue eyes show the alarm iâ€™ve seen so often in pre

steps forward. 
he has two older brothers, i know, iâ€™ve seen them in the ba-
kery, but one is probably too old now to volunteer and the 
other wonâ€™t. this is standard. family devotion only goes so far 
for most people on reaping day. what i did was the radical 
thing. the mayor begins to read the long, dull treaty of treason 
as he does every year at this point â€” itâ€™s required â€” but iâ€™m 
not listening to a word. 
why  him? i think. then i try to convince myself it doesnâ€™t 
matter. peeta mellark and i are not friends. not even neigh-
bors. we donâ€™t speak. our only real interaction happened 
years ago. heâ€™s probably forgotten it. but i havenâ€™t and i know 
i never will. . . . 
it was during the worst time. my father had been killed in 
the mine accident three months earlier in the bitterest janu-
ary anyone could remember. the numbness of his loss had 
passed, and the pain would hit me out of nowhere, doubling 
me over, racking my body with sobs. where are you? i would 
cry out in

upon them sitting motionless against a wall or lying in the 
meadow, you hear the wails from a house, and the peacekee-
pers are called in to retrieve the body. starvation is never the 
cause of death officially. itâ€™s always the flu, or exposure, or 
pneumonia. but that fools no one. 
on the afternoon of my encounter with peeta mellark, the 
rain was falling in relentless icy sheets. i had been in town, 
trying to trade some threadbare old baby clothes of primâ€™s in 
the public market, but there were no takers. although i had 
been to the hob on several occasions with my father, i was too 
frightened to venture into that rough, gritty place alone. the 
rain had soaked through my fatherâ€™s hunting jacket, leaving 
me chilled to the bone. for three days, weâ€™d had nothing but 
boiled water with some old dried mint leaves iâ€

t acknowledge me in any way. but as i collected prim 
and started for home that afternoon, i found him staring at me 
from across the school yard. our eyes met for only a second, 
then he turned his head away. i dropped my gaze, embar-
rassed, and thatâ€™s when i saw it. the first dandelion of the 
year. a bell went off in my head. i thought of the hours spent 
in the woods with my father and i knew how we were going to 
survive. 
to this day, i can never shake the connection between this 
boy, peeta mellark, and the bread that gave me hope, and the 
dandelion that reminded me that i was not doomed. and more 
than once, i have turned in the school hallway and caught his 
eyes trained on me, only to quickly flit away. i feel like i owe 
him something, and i hate owing people. maybe if i had 
thanked him at some point, iâ€™d be feeling less conflicted now. i 
thought about it a couple of times, but the opportunity never 
seemed to present itself. and now it never will. because weâ€™re 
going to be th

and then the peacekeeper is at the door, signaling our time 
is up, and weâ€™re all hugging one another so hard it hurts and 
all iâ€™m saying is â€œi love you. i love you both.â€ and theyâ€™re say-

ing it back and then the peacekeeper orders them out and the 
door closes. i bury my head in one of the velvet pillows as if 
this can block the whole thing out. 
someone else enters the room, and when i look up, iâ€™m sur-
prised to see itâ€™s the baker, peeta mellarkâ€™s father. i canâ€™t be-
lieve heâ€™s come to visit me. after all, iâ€™ll be trying to kill his son 
soon. but we do know each other a bit, and he knows prim 
even better. when she sells her goat cheeses at the hob, she 
puts two of them aside for him and he gives her a generous 
amount of bread in return. we always wait to trade with him 
when his witch of a wife isnâ€™t around because heâ€™s so much 
nicer. i feel certain he would never have hit his son the way 
she did over the burned bread

building to the train sta-
tion. iâ€™ve never been in a car before. rarely even ridden in wa-
gons. in the seam, we travel on foot. 
iâ€™ve been right not to cry. the station is swarming with re-
porters with their insectlike cameras trained directly on my 
face. but iâ€™ve had a lot of practice at wiping my face clean of 
emotions and i do this now. i catch a glimpse of myself on the 
television screen on the wall thatâ€™s airing my arrival live and 
feel gratified that i appear almost bored. 
peeta mellark, on the other hand, has obviously been crying 
and interestingly enough does not seem to be trying to cover 
it up. i immediately wonder if this will be his strategy in the 
games. to appear weak and frightened, to reassure the other 
tributes that he is no competition at all, and then come out 
fighting. this worked very well for a girl, johanna mason, from 
district 7 a few years back. she seemed like such a sniveling, 

41  

 

cowardly fool that no one bothered about her until there were

only a handful of contestants left. it turned out she could kill 
viciously. pretty clever, the way she played it. but this seems 
an odd strategy for peeta mellark because heâ€™s a bakerâ€™s son. 
all those years of having enough to eat and hauling bread 
trays around have made him broad-shouldered and strong. it 
will take an awful lot of weeping to convince anyone to over-
look him. 
we have to stand for a few minutes in the doorway of the 
train while the cameras gobble up our images, then weâ€™re al-
lowed inside and the doors close mercifully behind us. the 
train begins to move at once. 
the speed initially takes my breath away. of course, iâ€™ve

still, thereâ€™s something comforting about the little bird. itâ€™s 
like having a piece of my father with me, protecting me. i fas-
ten the pin onto my shirt, and with the dark green fabric as a 
background, i can almost imagine the mockingjay flying 
through the trees. 
effie trinket comes to collect me for supper. i follow her 
through the narrow, rocking corridor into a dining room with 
polished paneled walls. thereâ€™s a table where all the dishes

are highly breakable. peeta mellark sits waiting for us, the 
chair next to him empty. 
â€œwhereâ€™s haymitch?â€ asks effie trinket brightly. 
â€œlast time i saw him, he said he was going to take a nap,â€ 
says peeta. 
â€œwell, itâ€™s been an exhausting day,â€ says effie trinket. i 
think sheâ€™s relieved by haymitchâ€™s absence, and who can 
blame her? 
the supper comes in courses. a thick carrot soup, green 
salad, lamb chops and mashed potatoes, cheese and fruit, a 
chocolate cake. throughout the meal, effie trinket keeps r

waiting on us. guarding us. taking care of us is their job. 
â€œno. i donâ€™t want them,â€ says peeta. 
i nod and head to my own room. i understand how peeta 
feels. i canâ€™t stand the sight of the capitol people myself. but 
making them deal with haymitch might be a small form of re-
venge. so iâ€™m pondering the reason why he insists on taking 
care of haymitch and all of a sudden i think, itâ€™s because heâ€™s 
the idea pulls me up short. a kind peeta mellark is far more 
dangerous to me than an unkind one. kind people have a way 
of working their way inside me and rooting there. and i canâ€™t 
let peeta do this. not where weâ€™re going. so i decide, from this 
moment on, to have as little as possible to do with the bakerâ€™s 
son. when i get back to my room, the train is pausing at a plat-
form to refuel. i quickly open the window, toss the cookies 
peetaâ€™s father gave me out of the train, and slam the glass 
shut. no more. no more of either of t

unfortunately, the packet of cookies hits the ground and 
bursts open in a patch of dandelions by the track. i only see 
the image for a moment, because the train is off again, but itâ€™s 
enough. enough to remind me of that other dandelion in the 
school yard years ago . . .

i had just turned away from peeta mellarkâ€™s bruised face 
when i saw the dandelion and i knew hope wasnâ€™t lost. i 
plucked it carefully and hurried home. i grabbed a bucket and 
primâ€™s hand and headed to the meadow and yes, it was dotted 
with the golden-headed weeds. after weâ€™d harvested those, 
we scrounged along inside the fence for probably a mile until 
weâ€™d filled the bucket with the dandelion greens, stems, and 
flowers. that night, we gorged ourselves on dandelion salad 
and the rest of the bakery bread.

must be in the tunnel that runs up through the mountains into

the capitol. the mountains form a natural barrier between the 
capitol and the eastern districts. it is almost impossible to en-
ter from the east except through the tunnels. this geographi-
cal advantage was a major factor in the districts losing the war 
that led to my being a tribute today. since the rebels had to 
scale the mountains, they were easy targets for the capitolâ€™s 
air forces. 
peeta mellark and i stand in silence as the train speeds 
along. the tunnel goes on and on and i think of the tons of 
rock separating me from the sky, and my chest tightens. i hate 
being encased in stone this way. it reminds me of the mines 
and my father, trapped, unable to reach sunlight, buried for-
ever in the darkness. 
the train finally begins to slow and suddenly bright light 
floods the compartment. we canâ€™t help it. both peeta and i run 
to the window to see what weâ€™ve only seen on television,

 any of us can blame you. itâ€™d be hard not 
to fall for that young lady,â€ says caesar. â€œshe didnâ€™t know?â€ 
peeta shakes his head. â€œnot until now.â€ 
i allow my eyes to flicker up to the screen long enough to 
see that the blush on my cheeks is unmistakable. 
â€œwouldnâ€™t you love to pull her back out here and get a re-
sponse?â€ caesar asks the audience. the crowd screams assent. 
â€œsadly, rules are rules, and katniss everdeenâ€™s time has been 
spent. well, best of luck to you, peeta mellark, and i think i 
speak for all of panem when i say our hearts go with yours.â€ 
the roar of the crowd is deafening. peeta has absolutely 
wiped the rest of us off the map with his declaration of love

for me. when the audience finally settles down, he chokes out 
a quiet â€œthank youâ€ and returns to his seat. we stand for the 
anthem. i have to raise my head out of the required respect 
and cannot avoid seeing that every screen is now dominated 
by a shot of peeta and me, separa

endearment. â€œlook, if you want to spend the last hours of your 
life planning some noble death in the arena, thatâ€™s your choice. 
i want to spend mine in district twelve.â€ 
â€œwouldnâ€™t surprise me if you do,â€ says peeta. â€œgive my 
mother my best when you make it back, will you?â€ 
â€œcount on it,â€ i say. then i turn and leave the roof. i spend 
the rest of the night slipping in and out of a doze, imagining 
the cutting remarks i will make to peeta mellark in the morn-
ing. peeta mellark. we will see how high and mighty he is 
when he's faced with life and death. he'll probably turn into 
one of those raging beast tributes, the kind who tries to eat 
someone's heart after they've killed them. there was a guy

crawl out of the blisters on my hands and i canâ€™t shake them 
free. theyâ€™re climbing up my arms, my neck. someoneâ€™s 
screaming, a long high pitched scream that never breaks for 
breath. i have a vague idea it might be me. i trip and fall into a 
small pit lined with tiny orange bubbles that hum like the 
tracker jacker nest. tucking my knees up to my chin, i wait for 
death. sick and disoriented, iâ€™m able to form only one thought: 
then the ants bore into my eyes and i black out. 

peeta mellark just saved my life.

  i enter a nightmare from which i wake repeatedly only to 
find a greater terror awaiting me. all the things i dread most, 
all the things i dread for others manifest in such vivid detail i 
canâ€™t help but believe theyâ€™re real. each time i wake, i think, at 
last,  this  is  over, but it isnâ€™t. itâ€™s only the beginning of a new 
chapter of torture. how many ways do i watch prim die? re-
live my fatherâ€™s last moments? feel my own body ripped

bye, and we begin counting. â€œone.â€ maybe iâ€™m wrong. â€œtwo.â€ 
maybe they donâ€™t care if we both die. â€œthree!â€ itâ€™s too late to 
change my mind. i lift my hand to my mouth, taking one last 
look at the world. the berries have just passed my lips when 
the trumpets begin to blare. 
the frantic voice of claudius templesmith shouts above 
them. â€œstop! stop! ladies and gentlemen, i am pleased to 
present the victors of the seventy-fourth hunger games, kat-
niss everdeen and peeta mellark! i give you â€” the tributes of 
district twelve!â€

  i spew the berries from my mouth, wiping my tongue with 
the end of my shirt to make sure no juice remains. peeta pulls 
me to the lake where we both flush our mouths with water 
and then collapse into each otherâ€™s arms. 
â€œyou didnâ€™t swallow any?â€ i ask him. 
he shakes his head. â€œyou?â€ 
â€œguess iâ€™d be dead by now if i did,â€ i say. i can see his lips 
moving in reply, but i canâ€™t hear him over the roar of
