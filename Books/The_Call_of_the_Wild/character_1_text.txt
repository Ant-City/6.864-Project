away
from beneath; the sun ate from above. air-holes formed, fissures sprang
and spread apart, while thin sections of ice fell through bodily into
the river. and amid all this bursting, rending, throbbing of awakening
life, under the blazing sun and through the soft-sighing breezes, like
wayfarers to death, staggered the two men, the woman, and the huskies.

with the dogs falling, mercedes weeping and riding, hal swearing
innocuously, and charles’s eyes wistfully watering, they staggered into
john thornton’s camp at the mouth of white river. when they halted,
the dogs dropped down as though they had all been struck dead. mercedes
dried her eyes and looked at john thornton. charles sat down on a log
to rest. he sat down very slowly and painstakingly what of his great
stiffness. hal did the talking. john thornton was whittling the last
touches on an axe-handle he had made from a stick of birch. he whittled
and listened, gave monosyllabic replies, and, when it was asked, terse
advice. he knew the

breed, and he gave his advice in the certainty that
it would not be followed.

“they told us up above that the bottom was dropping out of the trail and
that the best thing for us to do was to lay over,” hal said in response
to thornton’s warning to take no more chances on the rotten ice. “they
told us we couldn’t make white river, and here we are.” this last with a
sneering ring of triumph in it.

“and they told you true,” john thornton answered. “the bottom’s likely
to drop out at any moment. only fools, with the blind luck of fools,
could have made it. i tell you straight, i wouldn’t risk my carcass on
that ice for all the gold in alaska.”

“that’s because you’re not a fool, i suppose,” said hal. “all the same,
we’ll go on to dawson.” he uncoiled his whip. “get up there, buck! hi!
get up there! mush on!”

thornton went on whittling. it was idle, he knew, to get between a fool
and his folly; while tw

scheme of things.

but the team did not get up at the command. it had long since passed
into the stage where blows were required to rouse it. the whip flashed
out, here and there, on its merciless errands. john thornton compressed
his lips. sol-leks was the first to crawl to his feet. teek followed.
joe came next, yelping with pain. pike made painful efforts. twice he
fell over, when half up, and on the third attempt managed to rise. buck
made no effort. he lay quietly where he had fallen. the lash bit into
him again and again, but he neither whined nor struggled. several times
thornton started, as though to speak, but changed his mind. a moisture
came into his eyes, and, as the whipping continued, he arose an

hey continued to fall upon
him, the spark of life within flickered and went down. it was nearly
out. he felt strangely numb. as though from a great distance, he was
aware that he was being beaten. the last sensations of pain left him. he
no longer felt anything, though very faintly he could hear the impact of
the club upon his body. but it was no longer his body, it seemed so far
away.

and then, suddenly, without warning, uttering a cry that was
inarticulate and more like the cry of an animal, john thornton sprang
upon the man who wielded the club. hal was hurled backward, as
though struck by a falling tree. mercedes screamed. charles looked on
wistfully, wiped his watery eyes, but did not get up because of his
stiffness.

john thornton stood over buck, struggling to control himself, too
convulsed with rage to speak.

“if you strike that dog again, i’ll kill you,” he at last managed to say
in a choking voice.

“it’s my dog,” hal replied, wiping the blood from his mouth as he came
back.

s and a state of terrible starvation, the
sled was a quarter of a mile away. dog and man watched it crawling along
over the ice. suddenly, they saw its back end drop down, as into a rut,
and the gee-pole, with hal clinging to it, jerk into the air. mercedes’s
scream came to their ears. they saw charles turn and make one step to
run back, and then a whole section of ice give way and dogs and humans
disappear. a yawning hole was all that was to be seen. the bottom had
dropped out of the trail.

john thornton and buck looked at each other.

“you poor devil,” said john thornton, and buck licked his hand.




chapter vi. for the love of a man


when john thornton froze his feet in the previous december his partners
had made him comfortable and left him to get well, going on themselves
up the river to get out a raft of saw-logs for dawson. he was still
limping slightly at the time he rescued buck, but with the continued
warm weather even the slight limp left him. and here, lying by the river
bank t
 
 ___________________________
 
hrough the long spring days, watching the running water, listening
lazily to the songs of birds and the hum of nature, buck slowly won back
his strength.

a rest comes very good after one has travelled three thousand miles,
and it must be confessed that buck waxed lazy as his wounds healed, his
muscles swelled out, and the flesh came back to cover his bones. for
that matter, they were all loafing,--buck, john thornton, and skeet
and nig,--waiting for the raft to come that was to carry them down to
dawson. skeet was a little irish setter who early made friends with
buck, who, in a dying condition, was unable to resent her first
advances. she had the doctor trait which some dogs possess; and as a
mother cat washes her kittens, so she washed and cleansed buck’s
wounds. regularly, each morning after he had finished his breakfast,
she performed her self-appointed task, till he came to look for her
ministrations

 as much as he did for thornton’s. nig, equally friendly,
though less demonstrative, was a huge black dog, half bloodhound and
half deerhound, with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature.

to buck’s surprise these dogs manifested no jealousy toward him. they
seemed to share the kindliness and largeness of john thornton. as buck
grew stronger they enticed him into all sorts of ridiculous games, in
which thornton himself could not forbear to join; and in this fashion
buck romped through his convalescence and into a new existence. love,
genuine passionate love, was his for the first time. this he had never
experienced at judge miller’s down in the sun-kissed santa clara valley.
with the judge’s sons, hunting and tramping, it had been a working
partnership; with the judge’s grandsons, a sort of pompous guar

dianship;
and with the judge himself, a stately and dignified friendship. but love
that was feverish and burning, that was adoration, that was madness, it
had taken john thornton to arouse.

this man had saved his life, which was something; but, further, he was
the ideal master. other men saw to the welfare of their dogs from a
sense of duty and business expediency; he saw to the welfare of his as
if they were his own children, because he could not help it. and he saw
further. he never forgot a kindly greeting or a cheering word, and to
sit down for a long talk with them (“gas” he called it) was as much his
delight as theirs. he had a way of taking buck’s head rou

and resting his own head upon buck’s, of shaking him back
and forth, the while calling him ill names that to buck were love
names. buck knew no greater joy than that rough embrace and the sound of
murmured oaths, and at each jerk back and forth it seemed that his heart
would be shaken out of his body so great was its ecstasy. and when,
released, he sprang to his feet, his mouth laughing, his eyes eloquent,
his throat vibrant with unuttered sound, and in that fashion remained
without movement, john thornton would reverently exclaim, “god! you can
all but speak!”

buck had a trick of love expression that was akin to hurt. he would
often seize thornton’s hand in his mouth and close so fiercely that the
flesh bore the impress of his teeth for some time afterward. and as
buck understood the oaths to be love words, so the man understood this
feigned bite for a caress.

for the most part, however, buck’s love was expressed in adoration.
while he went wild with happiness when thornton touched him

ient masters since he
had come into the northland had bred in him a fear that no master could
be permanent. he was afraid that thornton would pass out of his life as
perrault and francois and the scotch half-breed had passed out. even in
the night, in his dreams, he was haunted by this fear. at such times
he would shake off sleep and creep through the chill to the flap of
the tent, where he would stand and listen to the sound of his master’s
breathing.

but in spite of this great love he bore john thornton, which seemed
to bespeak the soft civilizing influence, the strain of the primitive,
which the northland had aroused in him, remained alive and active.
faithfulness and devotion, things born of fire and roof, were his; yet
he retained his wildness and wiliness. he was a thing of the wild, come
in from the wild to sit by john thornton’s fire, rather than a dog
of the soft southland stamped with the marks of generations of
civilization. because of his very great love, he could not steal from
th

is man, but from any other man, in any other camp, he did not hesitate
an instant; while the cunning with which he stole enabled him to escape
detection.

his face and body were scored by the teeth of many dogs, and he
fought as fiercely as ever and more shrewdly. skeet and nig were too
good-natured for quarrelling,--besides, they belonged to john thornton;
but the strange dog, no matter what the breed or valor, swiftly
acknowledged buck’s supremacy or found himself struggling for life with
a terrible antagonist. and buck was merciless. he had learned well the
law of club and fang, and he never forewent an advantage or drew back
from a foe he had started on the way to death. he had lessoned from
spitz, and from the chief fighting dogs of the police and mail, and knew
there was no middle course. he must master or be mastered; while to show
mercy
 
 ___________________________
 
 was a weakness. mercy did not exist in the primordial life. it was
misunderstood for fear, and such misunderstandings made for death. kill
or be killed, eat or be eaten, was the law; and this mandate, down out
of the depths of time, he obeyed.

he was older than the days he had seen and the breaths he had drawn. he
linked the past with the present, and the eternity behind him throbbed
through him in a mighty rhythm to which he swayed as the tides and
seasons swayed. he sat by john thornton’s fire, a broad-breasted dog,
white-fanged and long-furred; but behind him were the shades of all
manner of dogs, half-wolves and wild wolves, urgent and prompting,
tasting the savor of the meat he ate, thirsting for the water he drank,
scenting the wind with him, listening with him and telling him the
sounds made by the wild life in the forest, dictating his moods,
directing his actions, lying down to sleep with him when he lay down,
and dreaming with him and beyond him and becoming themselv

each day mankind and
the claims of mankind slipped farther from him. deep in the forest a
call was sounding, and as often as he heard this call, mysteriously
thrilling and luring, he felt compelled to turn his back upon the fire
and the beaten earth around it, and to plunge into the forest, and on
and on, he knew not where or why; nor did he wonder where or why, the
call sounding imperiously, deep in the forest. but as often as he gained
the soft unbroken earth and the green shade, the love for john thornton
drew him back to the fire again.

thornton alone held him. the rest of mankind was as nothing. chance
travellers might praise or pet him; but he was cold under it all,
and from a too demonstrative man he would get up and walk away. when
thornton’s partners, hans and pete, arrived on the long-expected raft,
buck refused to notice them till he learned they were close to thornton;
after that he tolerated them in a passive sort of way, accepting favors
from them as though he favored them by accep

timacy such as obtained with skeet and nig.

for thornton, however, his love seemed to grow and grow. he, alone among
men, could put a pack upon buck’s back in the summer travelling. nothing
was too great for buck to do, when thornton commanded. one day (they had
grub-staked themselves from the proceeds of the raft and left dawson
for the head-waters of the tanana) the men and dogs were sitting on the
crest of a cliff which fell away, straight down, to naked bed-rock three
hundred feet below. john thornton was sitting near the edge, buck at his
shoulder. a thoughtless whim seized thornton, and he drew the attention
of hans and pete to the experiment he had in mind. “jump, buck!” he
commanded, sweeping his arm out and over the chasm. the next instant he
was grappling with buck on the extreme edge, while hans and pete were
dragging them back into safety.

“it’s uncanny,” pete said, after it was over and they had caught their
speech.

thornton shook his head. “no, it is splendid, and it

 his throat was torn open.
then the crowd was upon buck, and he was driven off; but while a surgeon
checked the bleeding, he prowled up and down, growling furiously,
attempting to rush in, and being forced back by an array of hostile
clubs. a “miners’ meeting,” called on the spot, decided that the dog had
sufficient provocation, and buck was discharged. but his reputation was
made, and from that day his name spread through every camp in alaska.

later on, in the fall of the year, he saved john thornton’s life in
quite another fashion. the three partners were lining a long and narrow
poling-boat down a bad stretch of rapids on the forty-mile creek. hans
and pete moved along the bank, snubbing with a thin manila rope from
tree to tree, while thornton remained in the boat, helping its descent
by means of a pole, and shouting directions to the shore. buck, on the
bank, worried and anxious, kept abreast of the boat, his eyes never off
his master.

had not yet appeared. it was brought about by a conversation in the
eldorado saloon, in which men waxed boastful of their favorite dogs.
buck, because of his record, was the target for these men, and thornton
was driven stoutly to defend him. at the end of half an hour one man
stated that his dog could start a sled with five hundred pounds and
walk off with it; a second bragged six hundred for his dog; and a third,
seven hundred.

“pooh! pooh!” said john thornton; “buck can start a thousand pounds.”

“and break it out? and walk off with it for a hundred yards?” demanded
matthewson, a bonanza king, he of the seven hundred vaunt.

“and break it out, and walk off with it for a hundred yards,” john
thornton said coolly.

“well,” matthewson said, slowly and deliberately, so that all could
hear, “i’ve got a thousand dollars that says he can’t. and there it
is.” so saying, he slammed a sack of gold dust of the size of a bologna

o all save the clamor for battle. he called
hans and pete to him. their sacks were slim, and with his own the three
partners could rake together only two hundred dollars. in the ebb of
their fortunes, this sum was their total capital; yet they laid it
unhesitatingly against matthewson’s six hundred.

the team of ten dogs was unhitched, and buck, with his own harness, was
put into the sled. he had caught the contagion of the excitement, and
he felt that in some way he must do a great thing for john thornton.
murmurs of admiration at his splendid appearance went up. he was in
perfect condition, without an ounce of superfluous flesh, and the one
hundred and fifty pounds that he weighed were so many pounds of grit and
virility. his furry coat shone with the sheen of silk. down the neck and
across the shoulders, his mane, in repose as it was, half bristled and
seemed to lift with every movement, as though excess of vigor made each
particular hair alive and active. the great breast and heavy fore legs

ver returned from the quest. this lost mine was steeped in tragedy and
shrouded in mystery. no one knew of the first man. the oldest tradition
stopped before it got back to him. from the beginning there had been an
ancient and ramshackle cabin. dying men had sworn to it, and to the mine
the site of which it marked, clinching their testimony with nuggets that
were unlike any known grade of gold in the northland.

but no living man had looted this treasure house, and the dead were
dead; wherefore john thornton and pete and hans, with buck and half a
dozen other dogs, faced into the east on an unknown trail to achieve
where men and dogs as good as themselves had failed. they sledded
seventy miles up the yukon, swung to the left into the stewart river,
passed the mayo and the mcquestion, and held on until the stewart itself
became a streamlet, threading the upstanding peaks which marked the
backbone of the continent.

john thornton asked little of man or nature. he was unafraid of the
wild. with a hand

and through another winter they wandered on the obliterated trails of
men who had gone before. once, they came upon a path blazed through the
forest, an ancient path, and the lost cabin seemed very near. but the
path began nowhere and ended nowhere, and it remained mystery, as the
man who made it and the reason he made it remained mystery. another time
they chanced upon the time-graven wreckage of a hunting lodge, and
amid the shreds of rotted blankets john thornton found a long-barrelled
flint-lock. he knew it for a hudson bay company gun of the young days
in the northwest, when such a gun was worth its height in beaver skins
packed flat, and that was all--no hint as to the man who in an early day
had reared the lodge and left the gun among the blankets.

spring came on once more, and at the end of all their wandering they
found, not the lost cabin, but a shallow placer in a broad valley where
the gold showed like yellow butter across the bottom of the wa

l, running by the side of his wood
brother toward the place from where the call surely came. old memories
were coming upon him fast, and he was stirring to them as of old he
stirred to the realities of which they were the shadows. he had done
this thing before, somewhere in that other and dimly remembered world,
and he was doing it again, now, running free in the open, the unpacked
earth underfoot, the wide sky overhead.

they stopped by a running stream to drink, and, stopping, buck
remembered john thornton. he sat down. the wolf started on toward the
place from where the call surely came, then returned to him, sniffing
noses and making actions as though to encourage him. but buck turned
about and started slowly on the back track. for the better part of an
hour the wild brother ran by his side, whining softly. then he sat down,
pointed his nose upward, and howled. it was a mournful howl, and as buck
held steadily on his way he heard it grow faint and fainter until it was
lost in the distance.

n thornton was eating dinner when buck dashed into camp and sprang
upon him in a frenzy of affection, overturning him, scrambling upon him,
licking his face, biting his hand--“playing the general tom-fool,” as
john thornton characterized it, the while he shook buck back and forth
and cursed him lovingly.

for two days and nights buck never left camp, never let thornton out of
his sight. he followed him about at his work, watched him while he ate,
saw him into his blankets at night and out of them in the morning. but
after two days the call in the forest began to sound more imperiously
than ever. buck’s restlessness came back on him, and he was haunted by
recollections of the wild brother, and of the smiling land

stant.
in point of fact the three actions of perceiving, determining, and
responding were sequential; but so infinitesimal were the intervals
of time between them that they appeared simultaneous. his muscles were
surcharged with vitality, and snapped into play sharply, like steel
springs. life streamed through him in splendid flood, glad and rampant,
until it seemed that it would burst him asunder in sheer ecstasy and
pour forth generously over the world.

“never was there such a dog,” said john thornton one day, as the
partners watched buck marching out of camp.

“when he was made, the mould was broke,” said pete.

“py jingo! i t’ink so mineself,” hans affirmed.

they saw him marching out of camp, but they did not see the instant and
terrible transformation which took place as soon as he was within the
secrecy of the forest. he no longer marched. at once he became a thing
of the wild, stealing along softly, cat-footed, a passing shadow
that appeared and disappeared among the shadows.

ht, or sound, or smell, but by
some other and subtler sense. he heard nothing, saw nothing, yet knew
that the land was somehow different; that through it strange things were
afoot and ranging; and he resolved to investigate after he had finished
the business in hand.

at last, at the end of the fourth day, he pulled the great moose down.
for a day and a night he remained by the kill, eating and sleeping, turn
and turn about. then, rested, refreshed and strong, he turned his face
toward camp and john thornton. he broke into the long easy lope, and
went on, hour after hour, never at loss for the tangled way, heading
straight home through strange country with a certitude of direction that
put man and his magnetic needle to shame.

as he held on he became more and more conscious of the new stir in the
land. there was life abroad in it different from the life which had been
there throughout the summer. no longer was this fact borne in upon him
in some subtle, mysterious way. the birds talked of it, the

 breeze whispered of it. several times he
stopped and drew in the fresh morning air in great sniffs, reading a
message which made him leap on with greater speed. he was oppressed with
a sense of calamity happening, if it were not calamity already happened;
and as he crossed the last watershed and dropped down into the valley
toward camp, he proceeded with greater caution.

three miles away he came upon a fresh trail that sent his neck hair
rippling and bristling, it led straight toward camp and john thornton.
buck hurried on, swiftly and stealthily, every nerve straining and
tense, alert to the multitudinous details which told a story--all but
the end. his nose gave him a varying description of the passage of the
life on the heels of which he was travelling. he remarked the pregnant
silence of the forest. the bird life had flitted. the squirrels were in
hiding. one only he saw,--a sleek gray fellow, flattened against a gray
dead limb so that he seemed a part of it, a woody excrescence upon the
wood

 forward to the edge of the clearing, he found
hans, lying on his face, feathered with arrows like a porcupine. at the
same instant buck peered out where the spruce-bough lodge had been and
saw what made his hair leap straight up on his neck and shoulders.
a gust of overpowering rage swept over him. he did not know that he
growled, but he growled aloud with a terrible ferocity. for the last
time in his life he allowed passion to usurp cunning and reason, and it
was because of his great love for john thornton that he lost his head.

the yeehats were dancing about the wreckage of the spruce-bough lodge
when they heard a fearful roaring and saw rushing upon them an animal
the like of which they had never seen before. it was buck, a live
hurricane of fury, hurling himself upon them in a frenzy to destroy. he
sprang at the foremost man (it was the chief of the yeehats), ripping
the throat wide open till the rent jugular spouted a fountain of blood.
he did not pause to worry the victim, but ripped in pas

pool. by the edge, head and fore feet in the water, lay skeet, faithful
to the last. the pool itself, muddy and discolored from the sluice
boxes, effectually hid what it contained, and it contained john
thornton; for buck followed his trace into the water, from which no
trace led away.

all day buck brooded by the pool or roamed restlessly about the camp.
death, as a cessation of movement, as a passing out and away from the
lives of the living, he knew, and he knew john thornton was dead. it
left a great void in him, somewhat akin to hunger, but a void which
ached and ached, and which food could not fill, at times, when he paused
to contemplate the carcasses of the yeehats, he forgot the pain of it;
and at such times he was aware of a great pride in himself,--a pride
greater than any he had yet experienced. he had killed man, the noblest
game of all, and he had killed in the face of the law of club and fang.
he sniffed the bodies curiously. they had died so easily. it

an that which the yeehats
had made, he stood up, listening and scenting. from far away drifted a
faint, sharp yelp, followed by a chorus of similar sharp yelps. as the
moments passed the yelps grew closer and louder. again buck knew them
as things heard in that other world which persisted in his memory. he
walked to the centre of the open space and listened. it was the call,
the many-noted call, sounding more luringly and compellingly than ever
before. and as never before, he was ready to obey. john thornton was
dead. the last tie was broken. man and the claims of man no longer bound
him.

hunting their living meat, as the yeehats were hunting it, on the flanks
of the migrating moose, the wolf pack had at last crossed over from the
land of streams and timber and invaded buck’s valley. into the clearing
where the moonlight streamed, they poured in a silvery flood; and in the
centre of the clearing stood buck, motionless as a statue, waiting their
coming. they were awed, so still and large he stood
