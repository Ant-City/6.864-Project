chapter i

emma woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.
she was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate, indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sisterâ€™s marriage, been mistress of his house from a very early period. her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance

â€œi believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,â€ said mr. woodhouse, with a sigh. â€œi am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.â€
â€œmy dearest papa! you do not think i could mean you, or suppose mr. knightley to mean you. what a horrible idea! oh no! i meant only myself. mr. knightley loves to find fault with me, you knowâ€”in a jokeâ€”it is all a joke. we always say what we like to one another.â€
mr. knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults in emma woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them: and though this was not particularly agreeable to emma herself, she knew it would be so much less so to her father, that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body.

â€œpoor jane fairfax!â€â€”thought emma.â€”â€œyou have not deserved this. you may have done wrong with regard to mr. dixon, but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited!â€”the kindness and protection of mrs. elton!â€”â€˜jane fairfax and jane fairfax.â€™ heavens! let me not suppose that she dares go about, emma woodhouse-ing me!â€”but upon my honour, there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that womanâ€™s tongue!â€
emma had not to listen to such paradings againâ€”to any so exclusively addressed to herselfâ€”so disgustingly decorated with a â€œdear miss woodhouse.â€ the change on mrs. eltonâ€™s side soon afterwards appeared, and she was left in peaceâ€”neither forced to be the very particular friend of mrs. elton, nor, under mrs. eltonâ€™s guidance, the very active patroness of jane fairfax, and only sha

ness must have penetrated a part. i cannot doubt it. you will find, whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints, that it did not take her wholly by surprize. she frequently gave me hints of it. i remember her telling me at the ball, that i owed mrs. elton gratitude for her attentions to miss fairfax.â€”i hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss. while you considered me as having sinned against emma woodhouse, i could deserve nothing from either. acquit me here, and procure for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes of that said emma woodhouse, whom i regard with so much brotherly affection, as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself.â€”whatever strange things i said or did during that fortnight, you have now a key to. my heart was in highbury, and my business was to get my body thither as often as might be, and with the least suspicion. if you remember any qu
