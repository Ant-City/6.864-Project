beside the bed for a cigarette.

“why not? i’ve got a class at eleven-thirty.”

“you damned gloom! of course, if you don’t want to go to the coast--”

with a bound amory was out of bed, scattering the bureau cover’s burden
on the floor. the coast... he hadn’t seen it for years, since he and his
mother were on their pilgrimage.

“who’s going?” he demanded as he wriggled into his b. v. d.’s.

“oh, dick humbird and kerry holiday and jesse ferrenby and--oh about
five or six. speed it up, kid!”

in ten minutes amory was devouring cornflakes in renwick’s, and at
nine-thirty they bowled happily out of town, headed for the sands of
deal beach.

“you see,” said kerry, “the car belongs down there. in fact, it was
stolen from asbury park by persons unknown, who deserted it in princeton
and left for the west. heartless humbird here got permission from the
city council to deliver it.”

“anybody got any money?” suggested ferrenby, t

“what’s the matter, amory? amory’s thinking about poetry, about the
pretty birds and flowers. i can see it in his eye.”

“no, i’m not,” he lied. “i’m thinking about the princetonian. i ought to
make up to-night; but i can telephone back, i suppose.”

“oh,” said kerry respectfully, “these important men--”

amory flushed and it seemed to him that ferrenby, a defeated competitor,
winced a little. of course, kerry was only kidding, but he really
mustn’t mention the princetonian.

it was a halcyon day, and as they neared the shore and the salt breezes
scurried by, he began to picture the ocean and long, level stretches of
sand and red roofs over blue sea. then they hurried through the little
town and it all flashed upon his consciousness to a mighty paean of
emotion....

“oh, good lord! _look_ at it!” he cried.

“what?”

row, chanting a monotonous ditty about the sad
sea waves. then kerry saw a face in the crowd that attracted him and,
rushing off, reappeared in a moment with one of the homeliest girls
amory had ever set eyes on. her pale mouth extended from ear to ear, her
teeth projected in a solid wedge, and she had little, squinty eyes that
peeped ingratiatingly over the side sweep of her nose. kerry presented
them formally.

“name of kaluka, hawaiian queen! let me present messrs. connage, sloane,
humbird, ferrenby, and blaine.”

the girl bobbed courtesies all around. poor creature; amory supposed she
had never before been noticed in her life--possibly she was half-witted.
while she accompanied them (kerry had invited her to supper) she said
nothing which could discountenance such a belief.

“she prefers her native dishes,” said alec gravely to the waiter, “but
any coarse food will do.”

all through supper he addressed her in the most respectful language,
while kerry made idiotic love to her on

 crone in a sort of croaking triumph:

“he’s quite dead, all right. the car turned over. two of the men that
weren’t hurt just carried the others in, but this one’s no use.”

amory rushed into the house and the rest followed with a limp mass that
they laid on the sofa in the shoddy little front parlor. sloane, with
his shoulder punctured, was on another lounge. he was half delirious,
and kept calling something about a chemistry lecture at 8:10.

“i don’t know what happened,” said ferrenby in a strained voice. “dick
was driving and he wouldn’t give up the wheel; we told him he’d been
drinking too much--then there was this damn curve--oh, my _god!_...” he
threw himself face downward on the floor and broke into dry sobs.

the doctor had arrived, and amory went over to the couch, where some
one handed him a sheet to put over the body. with a sudden hardness, he
raised one of the hands and let it fall back inertly. the brow was cold
but the face not expressionless. he looked

at the shoe-laces--dick had
tied them that morning. _he_ had tied them--and now he was this heavy
white mass. all that remained of the charm and personality of the dick
humbird he had known--oh, it was all so horrible and unaristocratic and
close to the earth. all tragedy has that strain of the grotesque
and squalid--so useless, futile... the way animals die.... amory was
reminded of a cat that had lain horribly mangled in some alley of his
childhood.

“some one go to princeton with ferrenby.”

amory stepped outside the door and shivered slightly at the late night
wind--a wind that stirred a broken fender on the mass of bent metal to a
plaintive, tinny sound.

crescendo!

next day, by a merciful chance, passed in a whirl. when amory was by
himself his thoughts zigzagged inevitably to the picture of that red
mouth yawning incongruously in the white face, but with a determined
effort he piled present excitement upon the memory of it and shut it
coldly away from his

“‘lo, kerry.” he was most polite. “ah, men of princeton.” they seemed
to be mostly friends, so he picked up the envelope marked “registrar’s
office,” and weighed it nervously.

“we have here quite a slip of paper.”

“open it, amory.”

“just to be dramatic, i’ll let you know that if it’s blue, my name is
withdrawn from the editorial board of the prince, and my short career is
over.”

he paused, and then saw for the first time ferrenby’s eyes, wearing a
hungry look and watching him eagerly. amory returned the gaze pointedly.

“watch my face, gentlemen, for the primitive emotions.”

he tore it open and held the slip up to the light.

“well?”

“pink or blue?”

“say what it is.”

“we’re all ears, amory.”

“smile or swear--or something.”

there was a pause... a small crowd of seconds swept by... then he looked
again and another crowd went on into time.

“blue as the sky, gentlemen....”

for.”... it took two expert mechanics half a day to dissemble it into
its minutest parts and remove it, which only goes to prove the rare
energy of sophomore humor under efficient leadership.

then again, that very fall, burne had caused a sensation. a certain
phyllis styles, an intercollegiate prom-trotter, had failed to get her
yearly invitation to the harvard-princeton game.

jesse ferrenby had brought her to a smaller game a few weeks before,
and had pressed burne into service--to the ruination of the latter’s
misogyny.

“are you coming to the harvard game?” burne had asked indiscreetly,
merely to make conversation.

“if you ask me,” cried phyllis quickly.

“of course i do,” said burne feebly. he was unversed in the arts of
phyllis, and was sure that this was merely a vapid form of kidding.
before an hour had passed he knew that he was indeed involved. phyllis

talked to him lately?”

“no.”

“then you haven’t any conception of him.”

the argument ended nowhere, but amory noticed more than ever how the
sentiment toward burne had changed on the campus.

“it’s odd,” amory said to tom one night when they had grown more
amicable on the subject, “that the people who violently disapprove of
burne’s radicalism are distinctly the pharisee class--i mean they’re the
best-educated men in college--the editors of the papers, like yourself
and ferrenby, the younger professors.... the illiterate athletes like
langueduc think he’s getting eccentric, but they just say, ‘good old
burne has got some queer ideas in his head,’ and pass on--the pharisee
class--gee! they ridicule him unmercifully.”

the next morning he met burne hurrying along mccosh walk after a
recitation.

“whither bound, tsar?”

“over to the prince office to see ferrenby,” he waved a copy of the
morning’s princetonian at amory. “he wrote this editorial.”

“

t the devil--that editorial was on the coaching system.”

“yes, but that quotation--”

jesse sat up.

“what quotation?”

“you know: ‘he who is not with me is against me.’”

“well--what about it?”

jesse was puzzled but not alarmed.

“well, you say here--let me see.” burne opened the paper and read:
“‘_he who is not with me is against me_, as that gentleman said who
was notoriously capable of only coarse distinctions and puerile
generalities.’”

“what of it?” ferrenby began to look alarmed. “oliver cromwell said it,
didn’t he? or was it washington, or one of the saints? good lord, i’ve
forgotten.”

burne roared with laughter.

“oh, jesse, oh, good, kind jesse.”

“who said it, for pete’s sake?”

“well,” said burne, recovering his voice, “st. matthew attributes it to
christ.”

“my god!” cried jesse, and collapsed backward into the waste-basket.

for a minute neither spoke and then the big man asked:

“what was your university?”

“princeton.”

the big man became suddenly interested; the expression of his goggles
altered slightly.

“i sent my son to princeton.”

“did you?”

“perhaps you knew him. his name was jesse ferrenby. he was killed last
year in france.”

“i knew him very well. in fact, he was one of my particular friends.”

“he was--a--quite a fine boy. we were very close.”

amory began to perceive a resemblance between the father and the
dead son and he told himself that there had been all along a sense of
familiarity. jesse ferrenby, the man who in college had borne off the
crown that he had aspired to. it was all so far away. what little boys
they had been, working for blue ribbons--

huge hedge and a tall iron fence.

“won’t you come in for lunch?”

amory shook his head.

“thank you, mr. ferrenby, but i’ve got to get on.”

the big man held out his hand. amory saw that the fact that he had known
jesse more than outweighed any disfavor he had created by his opinions.
what ghosts were people with which to work! even the little man insisted
on shaking hands.

“good-by!” shouted mr. ferrenby, as the car turned the corner and
started up the drive. “good luck to you and bad luck to your theories.”

“same to you, sir,” cried amory, smiling and waving his hand.

eight hours from princeton amory sat down by the jersey roadside and
looked at the frost-bitten country. nature as a rather coarse phenomenon
composed largely of flowers that, when closely inspected, appeared
moth-eaten, and of ants that endlessly traversed
