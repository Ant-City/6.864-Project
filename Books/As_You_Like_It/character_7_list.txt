Oliver - 
                	The
oldest son of Sir Rowland de Bois and sole inheritor of the de Bois
estate. Oliver is a loveless young man who begrudges his brother,
Orlando, a gentleman's education. He admits to hating Orlando without
cause or reason and goes to great lengths to ensure his brother's
downfall. When Duke Frederick employs Oliver to find his missing
brother, Oliver finds himself living in despair in the Forest of
Ardenne, where Orlando saves his life. This display of undeserved
generosity prompts Oliver 
to change himself into a better, more loving person. His transformation
is evidenced by his love for 
the disguised Celia, whom he takes to be a simple shepherdess.
