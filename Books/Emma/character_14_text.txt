ch for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property. he had received a good education, but, on succeeding early in life to a small independence, had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged, and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county, then embodied.
captain weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to miss churchill, of a great yorkshire family, and miss churchill fell in love with him, nobody was surprized, except her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, and who were full of pride and importance, which the connexion would offend.
miss churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of her fortune—though her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate—was not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to the infinite mortification of mr. and mrs. churchill, who threw

oodness of being in love with him; but though she had one sort of spirit, she had not the best. she had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother, but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother’s unreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her former home. they lived beyond their income, but still it was nothing in comparison of enscombe: she did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at once to be the wife of captain weston, and miss churchill of enscombe.
captain weston, who had been considered, especially by the churchills, as making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst of the bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years’ marriage, he was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain. from the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved. the boy had, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother’s, been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and mr

. and mrs. churchill, having no children of their own, nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for, offered to take the whole charge of the little frank soon after her decease. some scruples and some reluctance the widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as they were overcome by other considerations, the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the churchills, and he had only his own comfort to seek, and his own situation to improve as he could.
a complete change of life became desirable. he quitted the militia and engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good way in london, which afforded him a favourable opening. it was a concern which brought just employment enough. he had still a small house in highbury, where most of his leisure days were spent; and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or

red him from that, even in his first marriage; but his second must shew him how delightful a well-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.
he had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was his own; for as to frank, it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle’s heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of churchill on coming of age. it was most unlikely, therefore, that he should ever want his father’s assistance. his father had no apprehension of it. the aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her husband entirely; but it was not in mr. weston’s nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he believed, so deservedly dear. he saw his son every year in london, and was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made highbury feel a

 sort of pride in him too. he was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern.
mr. frank churchill was one of the boasts of highbury, and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life. his coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved.
now, upon his father’s marriage, it was very generally proposed, as a most proper attention, that the visit should take place. there was not a dissentient voice on the subject, either when mrs. perry drank tea with mrs. and miss bates, or when mrs. and m

iss bates returned the visit. now was the time for mr. frank churchill to come among them; and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion. for a few days, every morning visit in highbury included some mention of the handsome letter mrs. weston had received. “i suppose you have heard of the handsome letter mr. frank churchill has written to mrs. weston? i understand it was a very handsome letter, indeed. mr. woodhouse told me of it. mr. woodhouse saw the letter, and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life.”
it was, indeed, a highly prized letter. mrs. weston had, of course, formed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense, and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marria

“i hope not that.—it is not likely. no, mr. knightley, do not foretell vexation from that quarter.”
“not i, indeed. i only name possibilities. i do not pretend to emma’s genius for foretelling and guessing. i hope, with all my heart, the young man may be a weston in merit, and a churchill in fortune.—but harriet smith—i have not half done about harriet smith. i think her the very worst sort of companion that emma could possibly have. she knows nothing herself, and looks upon emma as knowing every thing. she is a flatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse, because undesigned. her ignorance is hourly flattery. how can emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself, while harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority? and as for harriet, i will venture to say that

“three-and-twenty!—is he indeed?—well, i could not have thought it—and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother! well, time does fly indeed!—and my memory is very bad. however, it was an exceeding good, pretty letter, and gave mr. and mrs. weston a great deal of pleasure. i remember it was written from weymouth, and dated sept. 28th—and began, ‘my dear madam,’ but i forget how it went on; and it was signed ‘f. c. weston churchill.’—i remember that perfectly.”
“how very pleasing and proper of him!” cried the good-hearted mrs. john knightley. “i have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man. but how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father! there is something so shocking in a child’s being taken away from his parents and natural home! i never could comprehend how mr. weston could part with him. to give up one’s child! i really never could think well of any body who proposed such a th

“nobody ever did think well of the churchills, i fancy,” observed mr. john knightley coolly. “but you need not imagine mr. weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up henry or john. mr. weston is rather an easy, cheerful-tempered man, than a man of strong feelings; he takes things as he finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other, depending, i suspect, much more upon what is called society for his comforts, that is, upon the power of eating and drinking, and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week, th

nformation about his son; she heard the words “my son,” and “frank,” and “my son,” repeated several times over; and, from a few other half-syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son; but before she could quiet mr. elton, the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward.
now, it so happened that in spite of emma’s resolution of never marrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of mr. frank churchill, which always interested her. she had frequently thought—especially since his father’s marriage with miss taylor—that if she were to marry, he was the very person to suit her in age, character and condition. he seemed by this connexion between the families, quite to belong to her. she could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of. that mr. and mrs. weston did think of it, she was very strongly persuaded; and though not meaning to be induced by him, or

“we want only two more to be just the right number. i should like to see two more here,—your pretty little friend, miss smith, and my son—and then i should say we were quite complete. i believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing-room that we are expecting frank. i had a letter from him this morning, and he will be with us within a fortnight.”
emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented to his proposition of mr. frank churchill and miss smith making their party quite complete.
“he has been wanting to come to us,” continued mr. weston, “ever since september: every letter has been full of it; but he cannot command his own time. he has those to please who must be pleased, and who (between ourselves) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices. but now i have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in january.”

t observing, that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.— mrs. weston agreed to it; but added, that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of: “for i cannot depend upon his coming. i cannot be so sanguine as mr. weston. i am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing. mr. weston, i dare say, has been telling you exactly how the matter stands?”
“yes—it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of mrs. churchill, which i imagine to be the most certain thing in the world.”
“my emma!” replied mrs. weston, smiling, “what is the certainty of caprice?” then turning to isabella, who had not been attending before—“you must know, my dear mrs. knightley, that we are by no means so sure of seeing mr. frank churchill, in my opinion, as his father thinks. it depends entirely upon his aunt’s spirits and pleasure; in short, upon her temper. to you—to my two daughters—i may venture on the truth. m

rs. churchill rules at enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered woman; and his coming now, depends upon her being willing to spare him.”
“oh, mrs. churchill; every body knows mrs. churchill,” replied isabella: “and i am sure i never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion. to be constantly living with an ill-tempered person, must be dreadful. it is what we happily have never known any thing of; but it must be a life of misery. what a blessing, that she never had any children! poor little creatures, how unhappy she would have made them!”
emma wished she had been alone with mrs. weston. she should then have heard more: mrs. weston would speak to her, with

a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with isabella; and, she really believed, would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the churchills from her, excepting those views on the young man, of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge. but at present there was nothing more to be said. mr. woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing-room. to be sitting long after dinner, was a confinement that he could not endure. neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him; and gladly did he move to those with whom he was always comfortable.
while he talked to isabella, however, emma found an opportun

“and so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain. i am sorry for it. the introduction must be unpleasant, whenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better.”
“yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays. even if this family, the braithwaites, are put off, i am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us. i cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side; but i am sure there is a great wish on the churchills’ to keep him to themselves. there is jealousy. they are jealous even of his regard for his father. in short, i can feel no dependence on his coming, and i wish mr. weston were less sanguine.”
“he ought to come,” said emma. “if he could stay only a couple of days, he ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man’s not having it in his power to do as much as that. a young woman, if she fall into bad hands, may be teased, and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with

he likes it.”
“one ought to be at enscombe, and know the ways of the family, before one decides upon what he can do,” replied mrs. weston. “one ought to use the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family; but enscombe, i believe, certainly must not be judged by general rules: she is so very unreasonable; and every thing gives way to her.”
“but she is so fond of the nephew: he is so very great a favourite. now, according to my idea of mrs. churchill, it would be most natural, that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, to whom she owes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice towards him, she should frequently be governed by the nephew, to whom she owes nothing at all.”
“my dearest emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper, to understand a bad one, or to lay down rules for it: you must let it go its own way. i have no doubt of his having, at times, considerable influence; but it may be perfectly impos

e hour, before the other gentlemen appeared. mr. weston was chatty and convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort; but at last the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation. mr. elton, in very good spirits, was one of the first to walk in. mrs. weston and emma were sitting together on a sofa. he joined them immediately, and, with scarcely an invitation, seated himself between them.
emma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of mr. frank churchill, was willing to forget his late improprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before, and on his making harriet his very first subject, was ready to listen with most friendly smiles.
he professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend—her fair, lovely, amiable friend. “did she know?—had she heard any thing about her, since their being at randalls?—he felt much anxiety—he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably.” and in this style he talk

harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at mrs. goddard’s; mr. elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school; and it must be at hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth. where the wound had been given, there must the cure be found if anywhere; and emma felt that, till she saw her in the way of cure, there could be no true peace for herself.




chapter xviii

mr. frank churchill did not come. when the time proposed drew near, mrs. weston’s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse. for the present, he could not be spared, to his “very great mortification and regret; but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to randalls at no distant period.”
mrs. weston was exceedingly disappointed—much more disappointed, in fact, than her husband, though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober: but a sanguine temper, though

 much better plan; better time of year; better weather; and that he would be able, without any doubt, to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner.
these feelings rapidly restored his comfort, while mrs. weston, of a more apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays; and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer, suffered a great deal more herself.
emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about mr. frank churchill’s not coming, except as a disappointment at randalls. the acquaintance at present had no charm for her. she wanted, rather, to be quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it was desirable that she should appear, in general, like her usual self, she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance, and enter as warmly into mr. and mrs. weston’s disappointment, as might naturally belong to their friendship.
she was the first to announce it to mr. knightley; and exclaimed quite as

much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps rather more,) at the conduct of the churchills, in keeping him away. she then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in surry; the pleasure of looking at somebody new; the gala-day to highbury entire, which the sight of him would have made; and ending with reflections on the churchills again, found herself directly involved in a disagreement with mr. knightley; and, to her great amusement, perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion, and making use of mrs. weston’s arguments against herself.
“the churchills are very likely in fault,” said mr. knightley, coolly; “but i dare say he might come if he would.”
“i do not know why you should say so. he wishes exceedingly to come; but his uncle and aunt will not spare him.”
“i ca

“how odd you are! what has mr. frank churchill done, to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature?”
“i am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure, from living with those who have always set him the example of it. it is a great deal more natural than one could wish, that a young man, brought up by those who are proud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and selfish too. if frank church

“it is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount. he cannot want money—he cannot want leisure. we know, on the contrary, that he has so much of both, that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom. we hear of him for ever at some watering-place or other. a little while ago, he was at weymouth. this proves that he can leave the churchills.”
“yes, sometimes he can.”
“and those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while; whenever there is any temptation of pleasure.”
“it is very unfair to judge of any body’s conduct, without an intimate knowledge of their situation. nobody, who has not been in the interior of a family, can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be. we ought to be acquainted with enscombe, and with mrs. churchill’s temper, before we pretend to decide upon what her nephe

“there is one thing, emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses, and that is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour and resolution. it is frank churchill’s duty to pay this attention to his father. he knows it to be so, by his promises and messages; but if he wished to do it, it might be done. a man who felt rightly would say at once, simply and resolutely, to mrs. churchill—‘every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience; but i must go and see my father immediately. i know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion. i shall, therefore, set off to-morrow.’—if he would say so to her at once, in the tone of decision becoming a man, there would be no opposition made to his going.”
“no,” said emma, laughing; “but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back a

“i rather doubt that. you are very fond of bending little minds; but where little minds belong to rich people in authority, i think they have a knack of swelling out, till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones. i can imagine, that if you, as you are, mr. knightley, were to be transported and placed all at once in mr. frank churchill’s situation, you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him; and it might have a very good effect. the churchills might not have a word to say in return; but then, you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through. to him who has, it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence, and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought. he may have as strong a sense of what would be right, as you can ha

“well, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he will be a treasure at highbury. we do not often look upon fine young men, well-bred and agreeable. we must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain. cannot you imagine, mr. knightley, what a sensation his coming will produce? there will be but one subject throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury; but one interest—one object of curiosity; it will be all mr. frank churchill; we shall think and speak of nobody else.”
“you will excuse my being so much over-powered. if i find him conversable, i shall be glad of his acquaintance; but if he is only a chattering coxcomb, he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts.”
“my idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body, and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable. to you, he will talk of farming; to me, of drawing or music; and so on to every body, having t

months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear: and the campbells, whatever might be their motive or motives, whether single, or double, or treble, gave the arrangement their ready sanction, and said, that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air, for the recovery of her health, than on any thing else. certain it was that she was to come; and that highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it—mr. frank churchill—must put up for the present with jane fairfax, who could bring only the freshness of a two years’ absence.
emma was sorry;—to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months!—to be always doing more than she wished, and less than she ought! why she did not like jane fairfax might be a difficult question to answer; mr. knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman, which she wanted to be thought herself; and th

ch. it was all general approbation and smoothness; nothing delineated or distinguished. it did her no service however. her caution was thrown away. emma saw its artifice, and returned to her first surmises. there probably was something more to conceal than her own preference; mr. dixon, perhaps, had been very near changing one friend for the other, or been fixed only to miss campbell, for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds.
the like reserve prevailed on other topics. she and mr. frank churchill had been at weymouth at the same time. it was known that they were a little acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could emma procure as to what he truly was. “was he handsome?”—“she believed he was reckoned a very fine young man.” “was he agreeable?”—“he was generally thought so.” “did he appear a sensible young man; a young man of information?”—“at a watering-place, or in a common london acquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points. manners w

chapter iii

emma could not forgive her;—but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by mr. knightley, who had been of the party, and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side, he was expressing the next morning, being at hartfield again on business with mr. woodhouse, his approbation of the whole; not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room

“four o’clock!—depend upon it he will be here by three,” was mr. weston’s quick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting. emma’s spirits were mounted quite up to happiness; every thing wore a different air; james and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as before. when she looked at the hedges, she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out; and when she turned round to harriet, she saw something like a look of spring, a tender smile even there.
“will mr. frank churchill pass through bath as well as oxford?”—was a question, however, which did not augur much.
but neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once, and emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time.
the morning of the interesting day arrived, and mrs. weston’s faithful pupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelve o’clock, that she was to think of her at four.
“my dear, dear anxious friend,”—said she, in mental soliloquy, while walking downs

she opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with her father—mr. weston and his son. they had been arrived only a few minutes, and mr. weston had scarcely finished his explanation of frank’s being a day before his time, and her father was yet in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations, when she appeared, to have her share of surprize, introduction, and pleasure.
the frank churchill so long talked of, so high in interest, was actually before her—he was presented to her, and she did not think too much had been said in his praise; he was a very good looking young man; height, air, address, all were unexceptionable, and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his father’s; he looked quick and sensible. she felt immediately that she should like him; and there was a well-bred ease of manner, and a readiness to talk, which convinced her that he came

to every marriage that was arranged, he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any; it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons’ understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were proved against them. she blessed the favouring blindness. he could now, without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise, without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest, give way to all his natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after mr. frank churchill’s accommodation on his journey, through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road, and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold—which, however, he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night.
a reasonable visit paid, mr. weston began to move.—“he must be going. he had business at the crown about his hay, and a great many errands for mrs. weston at ford’s, but he need not hurry any body else.” hi

“my dear sir, upon no account in the world; my father can direct me.”
“but your father is not going so far; he is only going to the crown, quite on the other side of the street, and there are a great many houses; you might be very much at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk, unless you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street.”
mr. frank churchill still declined it, looking as serious as he could, and his father gave his hearty support by calling out, “my good friend, this is quite unnecessary; frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it, and as to mrs. bates’s, he may get there from the crown in a hop, step, and jump.”
they were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one, and a graceful bow from the other, the two gentlemen took leave. emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance, and could

the next morning brought mr. frank churchill again. he came with mrs. weston, to whom and to highbury he seemed to take very cordially. he had been sitting with her, it appeared, most companionably at home, till her usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse their walk, immediately fixed on highbury.—“he did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him, he should always chuse the same. highbury, that airy, cheerful, happy-looking highbury, would be his constant attraction.”—highbury,

nd him, could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting; and even when particulars were given and families described, he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing, or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body’s returning into their proper place the next morning. he argued like a young man very much bent on dancing; and emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the churchills. he seemed to have all the life and spirit, cheerful feelings, and social inclinations of his father, and nothing of the pride or reserve of enscombe. of pride, indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his indifference to a confusion of rank, bordered too much on inelegance of mind. he could be no judge, however, of the evil he was holding cheap. it was but an effusion of lively spirits.
at last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the crown; and being now almost facing the house

“you know miss fairfax’s situation in life, i conclude; what she is destined to be?”
“yes—(rather hesitatingly)—i believe i do.”
“you get upon delicate subjects, emma,” said mrs. weston smiling; “remember that i am here.—mr. frank churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of miss fairfax’s situation in life. i will move a little farther off.”
“i certainly do forget to think of her,” said emma, “as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend.”
he looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment.
when the gloves were bought, and they had quitted the shop again, “did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of, play?” said frank churchill.
“ever hear her!” repeated emm

 he was talking about, and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life, and to marry, from worthy motives. he might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeper’s room, or a bad butler’s pantry, but no doubt he did perfectly feel that enscombe could not make him happy, and that whenever he were attached, he would willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment.




chapter vii

emma’s very good opinion of frank churchill was a little shaken the following day, by hearing that he was gone off to london, merely to have his hair cut. a sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast, and he had sent for a chaise and set off, intending to return to dinner, but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut. there was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand; but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve. it did not accord

it was the arrival of this very invitation while the westons were at hartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her first remark, on reading it, was that “of course it must b

he did, on the condition of some promises on her side: such as that, if she came home cold, she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly; if hungry, that she would take something to eat; that her own maid should sit up for her; and that serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house, as usual.

frank churchill came back again; and if he kept his father’s dinner waiting, it was not known at hartfield; for mrs. weston was too anxious for his being a favourite with mr. woodhouse, to betray any imperfection which could be concealed.
he came back, had had his hair cut, and laughed at himself with a very good grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had done. he had no reason to wish his hair longer, to conceal any confusion of face; no reason to wish the money unspent, to improve his

miss woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of mrs. cole’s, turned to frank churchill.
“why do you smile?” said she.
“nay, why do you?”
“me!—i suppose i smile for pleasure at colonel campbell’s being so rich and so liberal.—it is a handsome present.”
“very.”
“i rather wonder that it was never made before.”
“perhaps miss fairfax has never been staying here so long before.”
“or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument—which must now be shut up in london, untouched by any body.”
“that is a grand pianoforte, and he might think it

ellent friend colonel campbell.”
mrs. weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interested by the circumstance, and emma could not help being amused at her perseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask and to say as to tone, touch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible, which she plainly read in the fair heroine’s countenance.
they were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first of the early was frank churchill. in he walked, the first and the handsomest; and after paying his compliments en passant to miss bates and her niece, made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle, where sat miss woodhouse; and till he could find a seat by her, would not sit at all. emma divined what every body present must be thinking. she was his object, and every body must perceive it. she introduced him to her friend, miss smith, and, at convenient moments afterwards, heard what each thought of the other. “he

she saw that enscombe could not satisfy, and that highbury, taken at its best, might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at home than he liked. his importance at enscombe was very evident. he did not b

“perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day, out of so few, in having your hair cut.”
“no,” said he, smiling, “that is no subject of regret at all. i have no pleasure in seeing my friends, unless i can believe myself fit to be seen.”
the rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, emma found herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes, and listen to mr. cole. when mr. cole had moved away, and her attention could be restored as before, she saw frank churchill looking intently across the room at miss fairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite.
“what is the matter?” said she.
he started. “thank you for rousing me,” he replied. “i believe i have been very rude; but really miss fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way—so very odd a way—that i cannot keep my eyes from her. i never saw any thing so outree!—those curls!—this must be a fancy of her own. i see nobody else looking like her!—i must go and ask her whether it is an irish fash

they combated the point some time longer in the same way; emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend; for mrs. weston was the most used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;—and at the same moment mr. cole approaching to entreat miss woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it. frank churchill, of whom, in the eagerness of her conversation with mrs. weston, she had been seeing nothing, except that he had found a seat by miss fairfax, followed mr. cole, to add his very pressing entreaties; and as, in every respect, it suited emma best to lead, she gave a very proper compliance.
she knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable, and could accompa

“that will do,” said he, when it was finished, thinking aloud—“you have sung quite enough for one evening—now be quiet.”
another song, however, was soon begged for. “one more;—they would not fatigue miss fairfax on any account, and would only ask for one more.” and frank churchill was heard to say, “i think you could manage this without effort; the first part is so very trifling. the strength of the song falls on the second.”
mr. knightley grew angry.
“that fellow,” said he, indignantly, “thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice. this must not be.” and touching miss bates, who at that moment passed near—“miss bates, are you mad, to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner? go, and interfere. they have no mercy on her.”

while waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off, emma found time, in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her voice and her taste, to look about, and see what became of mr. knightley. this would be a trial. he was no dancer in general. if he were to be very alert in engaging jane fairfax now, it might augur something. there was no immediate appearance. no; he was talkin

two dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed. it was growing late, and miss bates became anxious to get home, on her mother’s account. after some attempts, therefore, to be permitted to begin again, they were obliged to thank mrs. weston, look sorrowful, and have done.
“perhaps it is as well,” said frank churchill, as he attended emma to her carriage. “i must have asked miss fairfax, and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me, after yours.”

emma did not repent her condescension in going to the coles. the visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day; and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion, must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity. she must have delighted the coles—worthy people, who deserved to be made h

perfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were two points on which she was not quite easy. she doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying her suspicions of jane fairfax’s feelings to frank churchill. it was hardly right; but it had been so strong an idea, that it would escape her, and his submission to all that she told, was a compliment to her penetration, which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue.
the other circumstance of regret related also to jane fairfax; and there she had no doubt. she did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing. she did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhoo

“those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference. the truth is, harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised, but jane fairfax’s is much beyond it.”
“well, i always shall think that you play quite as well as she does, or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out. mr. cole said how much taste you had; and mr. frank churchill talked a great deal about your taste, and that he valued taste much more than execution.”
“ah! but jane fairfax has them both, harriet.”
“are you sure? i saw she had execution, but i did not know she had any taste. nobody talked about it. and i hate italian singing.—there is no understanding a word of it. besides, if she does play so very well, you know, it is no more than she is obliged to do, because she will have to teach. the coxes were wondering last night whether she would get i

sterday’s engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting. mrs. weston informed her that she was going to call on the bateses, in order to hear the new instrument.
“for my companion tells me,” said she, “that i absolutely promised miss bates last night, that i would come this morning. i was not aware of it myself. i did not know that i had fixed a day, but as he says i did, i am going now.”
“and while mrs. weston pays her visit, i may be allowed, i hope,” said frank churchill, “to join your party and wait for her at hartfield—if you are going home.”
mrs. weston was disappointed.
“i thought you meant to go with me. they would be very much pleased.”
“me! i should be quite in the way. but, perhaps—i may be equally in the way here. miss woodhouse looks as if she did not want me. my aunt always sends me off when she is shopping. she says i fidget her to death; and miss woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same. what am i to do?”

emma wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix.
“i declare i cannot recollect what i was talking of.—oh! my mother’s spectacles. so very obliging of mr. frank churchill! ‘oh!’ said he, ‘i do think i can fasten the rivet; i like a job of this kind excessively.’—which you know shewed him to be so very.... indeed i must say that, much as i had heard of him before and much as i had expected, he very far exceeds any thing.... i do congratulate you, mrs. weston, most warmly. he seems every thing the fondest parent could.... ‘oh!’ said he, ‘i can fasten the rivet. i like a job of that sort excessively.’ i never shall forget his manner. and when i br

chapter x

the appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered, was tranquillity itself; mrs. bates, deprived of her usual employment, slumbering on one side of the fire, frank churchill, at a table near her, most deedily occupied about her spectacles, and jane fairfax, standing with her back to them, intent on her pianoforte.
busy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing emma again.
“this is a pleasure,” said he, in rather a low voice, “coming at least ten minutes earlier than i had calculated. you find me trying to be useful; tell me if you think i shall succeed.”
“what!” said mrs. weston, “have not you finished i

 feelings, whatever their origin, and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again.
at last jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given, the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to. mrs. weston had been delighted before, and was delighted again; emma joined her in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every proper discrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise.
“whoever colonel campbell might employ,” said frank churchill, with a smile at emma, “the person has not chosen ill. i heard a good deal of colonel campbell’s taste at weymouth; and the softness of the upper notes i am sure is exactly what he and all that party would particularly prize. i dare say, miss fairfax, that he either gave his friend very minute directions, or wrote to broadwood himself. do not you think so?”
jane did not look round. she was not obliged to hear. mrs. weston had been speaking to her at the same moment.

chapter xi

it may be possible to do without dancing entirely. instances have been known of young people passing many, many months successively, without being at any ball of any description, and no material injury accrue either to body or mind;—but when a beginning is made—when the felicities of rapid motion have once been, though slightly, felt—it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more.
frank churchill had danced once at highbury, and longed to dance again; and the last half-hour of an evening which mr. woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his daughter at randalls, was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject. frank’s was the first idea; and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance. but still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully mr. fran

k churchill and miss woodhouse danced—for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with jane fairfax—and even for simple dancing itself, without any of the wicked aids of vanity—to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold—and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour, in the hope of discovering, in spite of all that mr. weston could say of their exactly equal size, that it was a little the largest.

mrs. weston was sorry for such a charge. she knew the importance of it, and said every thing in her power to do it away. every door was now closed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again; and with such good-will on frank churchill’s part, that the space which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple, was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten.
“we were too magnificent,” said he. “we allowed unnecessary room. ten couple may stand here very well.”
emma demurred. “it would be a crowd—a sad crowd; and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in?”
“very true,” he gravely replied; “it was very bad.” but still he went on measuring, and still

ke it acceptable.
“no; he thought it very far from an improvement—a very bad plan—much worse than the other. a room at an inn was always damp and dangerous; never properly aired, or fit to be inhabited. if they must dance, they had better dance at randalls. he had never been in the room at the crown in his life—did not know the people who kept it by sight.—oh! no—a very bad plan. they would catch worse colds at the crown than anywhere.”
“i was going to observe, sir,” said frank churchill, “that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body’s catching cold—so much less danger at the crown than at randalls! mr. perry might have reason to regret the alteration, but nobody else could.”
“sir,” said mr. woodhouse, rather warmly, “you are very much mistaken if you suppose mr. perry to be that sort of character. mr. perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill. but i do not understand how the room at the crown can be sa

“from the very circumstance of its being larger, sir. we shall have no occasion to open the windows at all—not once the whole evening; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold air upon heated bodies, which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief.”
“open the windows!—but surely, mr. churchill, nobody would think of opening the windows at randalls. nobody could be so imprudent! i never heard of such a thing. dancing with open windows!—i am sure, neither your father nor mrs. weston (poor miss taylor that was) would suffer it.”
“ah! sir—but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected. i have often known it done myself.”

“my father and mrs. weston are at the crown at this moment,” said frank churchill, “examining the capabilities of the house. i left them there and came on to hartfield, impatient for your opinion, and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot. i was desired to say so from both. it would be the greatest pleasure to them, if you could allow me to attend you there. they can do nothing satisfactorily without you.”

 rooms, some suggesting, some attending, and all in happy enjoyment of the future. the party did not break up without emma’s being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening, nor without her overhearing mr. weston whisper to his wife, “he has asked her, my dear. that’s right. i knew he would!”




chapter xii

one thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to emma—its being fixed for a day within the granted term of frank churchill’s stay in surry; for, in spite of mr. weston’s confidence, she could not think it so very impossible that the churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his fortnight. but this was not judged feasible. the preparations must take their time, nothing could be properly ready till the third week were entered on, and for a few days they must be planning, proceeding and hoping in uncertainty—at the risk—in her opinion, the great risk, of its being all in vain.

it was not to oblige jane fairfax therefore that he would have preferred the society of william larkins. no!—she was more and more convinced that mrs. weston was quite mistaken in that surmise. there was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his side—but no love.
alas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with mr. knightley. two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over-throw of every thing. a letter arrived from mr. churchill to urge his nephew’s instant return. mrs. churchill was unwell—far too unwell to do without him; she had been in a very suffering state (so said her husband) when writing to her nephew two days before, though from her usual unwillingness to give pain, and constant habit of never thinking of herself, she had not mentioned it; but now she was too ill to trifle, and must entreat him to set off for enscombe without delay.
the substance of this letter was forwarded to emma, in a note from mrs. w

is wretched note was the finale of emma’s breakfast. when once it had been read, there was no doing any thing, but lament and exclaim. the loss of the ball—the loss of the young man—and all that the young man might be feeling!—it was too wretched!—such a delightful evening as it would have been!—every body so happy! and she and her partner the happiest!—“i said it would be so,” was the only consolation.
her father’s feelings were quite distinct. he thought principally of mrs. churchill’s illness, and wanted to know how she was treated; and as for the ball, it was shocking to have dear emma disappointed; but they would all be safer at home.
emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared; but if this reflected at all upon his impatience, his sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him. he felt the going away almost too much to speak of it. his dejection was most evident. he sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes; and w

a very friendly shake of the hand, a very earnest “good-bye,” closed the speech, and the door had soon shut out frank churchill. short had been the notice—short their meeting; he was gone; and emma felt so sorry to part, and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry, and feeling it too much.
it was a sad change. they had been meeting almost every day since his arrival. certainly his being at randalls had given great spirit to the last two weeks—indescribable spirit; the idea, the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought, the assuranc

love with him, in spite of every previous determination against it.
“i certainly must,” said she. “this sensation of listlessness, weariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employ myself, this feeling of every thing’s being dull and insipid about the house!— i must be in love; i should be the oddest creature in the world if i were not—for a few weeks at least. well! evil to some is always good to others. i shall have many fellow-mourners for the ball, if not for frank churchill; but mr. knightley will be happy. he may spend the evening with his dear william larkins now if he likes.”
mr. knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness. he could not say that he was sorry on his own account; his very cheerful look would have contradicted him if he had; but he said, and very steadily, that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others, and with considerable kindness added,

emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love. her ideas only varied as to the how much. at first, she thought it was a good deal; and afterwards, but little. she had great pleasure in hearing frank churchill talked of; and, for his sake, greater pleasure than ever in seeing mr. and mrs. weston; she was very often thinking of him, and quite impatient for a letter, that she might know how he was, how were his spirits, how was his aunt, and what was the chance of his coming to randalls again this spring. but, on the other hand, she could not admit herself to be unhappy, nor, after the first morning, to be less disposed for employment than usual; she was still busy and cheerful; and, pleasing as he was

ct of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all conveyed. compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these words—“i had not a spare moment on tuesday, as you know, for miss woodhouse’s beautiful little friend. pray make my excuses and adieus to her.” this, emma could not doubt, was all for herself. harriet was remembered only from being her friend. his information and prospects as to enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated; mrs. churchill was recovering, and he dared not yet, even in his own imagination, fix a time for coming to randalls again.
gratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the material part, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up and returned to mrs. weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth, that she could still do without the writer, and that he must learn to do without her. her intentions were unchanged. her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a

it was well to have a comfort in store on harriet’s behalf, though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil in that quarter was at hand. as frank churchill’s arrival had succeeded mr. elton’s engagement in the conversation of highbury, as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first, so now upon frank churchill’s disappearance, mr. elton’s concerns were assuming the most irresistible form.—his wedding-day was named. he would soon be among them again; mr. elton and his bride. there was hardly time to talk over the first letter from enscombe before “mr. elton and his bride” was in every body’s mouth, and frank churchill was

all this ran so glibly through her thoughts, that by the time her father had arranged himself, after the bustle of the eltons’ departure, and was ready to speak, she was very tolerably capable of attending.
“well, my dear,” he deliberately began, “considerin

mrs. weston was disengaged and emma began again—“mr. frank churchill writes one of the best gentleman’s hands i ever saw.”
“i do not admire it,” said mr. knightley. “it is too small—wants strength. it is like a woman’s writing.”
this was not submitted to by either lady. they vindicated him against the base aspersion. “no, it by no means wanted strength—it was not a large hand, but very clear and certainly strong. had not mrs. weston any letter about her to produce?” no, she had heard from him very lately, but having answered the letter, had

“he chose to say he was employed”—
“well, well, i have that note; and can shew it after dinner to convince mr. knightley.”
“oh! when a gallant young man, like mr. frank churchill,” said mr. knightley dryly, “writes to a fair lady like miss woodhouse, he will, of course, put forth his best.”
dinner was on table.—mrs. elton, before she could be spoken to, was ready; and before mr. woodhouse had reached her with his request to be allowed to hand her into the dining-parlour, was saying—
“must i go first? i really am ashamed of always leading the way.”

“i hope i shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you,” said mr. weston.
mrs. elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope, smiled most graciously.
“you have heard of a certain frank churchill, i presume,” he continued—“and know him to be my son, though he does not bear my name.”
“oh! yes, and i shall be very happy in his acquaintance. i am sure mr. elton will lose no time in calling on him; and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the vicarage.”
“you are very obliging.—frank will be extremely happy, i am sure.— he is to be in town next week, if not sooner. we have notice of it in a letter to-day. i met the letters in my way this morning, and seeing my

inst that.—a most dangerous precedent indeed!—i beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example.—upon my word, if this is what i am to expect, we married women must begin to exert ourselves!—oh! mr. weston, i could not have believed it of you!”
“aye, we men are sad fellows. you must take care of yourself, mrs. elton.—this letter tells us—it is a short letter—written in a hurry, merely to give us notice—it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly, on mrs. churchill’s account—she has not been well the whole winter, and thinks enscombe too cold for her—so they are all to move southward without loss of time.”
“indeed!—from yorkshire, i think. enscombe is in yorkshire?”
“yes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from london, a considerable journey.”
“yes, upon my word, very considerable. sixty-five miles farther than from maple grove to london. but what is distance, mr. weston, to people of large fortune?—you would be amazed to he

ar how my brother, mr. suckling, sometimes flies about. you will hardly believe me—but twice in one week he and mr. bragge went to london and back again with four horses.”
“the evil of the distance from enscombe,” said mr. weston, “is, that mrs. churchill, as we understand, has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together. in frank’s last letter she complained, he said, of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncle’s! this, you know, speaks a great degree of weakness—but now she is so impatient to be in town, that she means to sleep only two nights on the road.—so frank writes word. certainly, delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions, mrs. elton. you must grant me that.”

no, indeed, i shall grant you nothing. i always take the part of my own sex. i do indeed. i give you notice—you will find me a formidable antagonist on that point. i always stand up for women—and i assure you, if you knew how selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn, you would not wonder at mrs. churchill’s making incredible exertions to avoid it. selina says it is quite horror to her—and i believe i have caught a little of her nicety. she always travels with her own sheets; an excellent precaution. does mrs. churchill do the same?”
“depend upon it, mrs. churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did. mrs. churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for”—
mrs. elton eagerly interposed with,
“oh! mr. weston, do not mistake me. selina is no fine lady, i assure

you. do not run away with such an idea.”
“is not she? then she is no rule for mrs. churchill, who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld.”
mrs. elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly. it was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was not a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it;—and she was considering in what way she had best retract, when mr. weston went on.
“mrs. churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may suspect—but this is quite between ourselves. she is very fond of frank, and therefore i would not speak ill of her. besides, she is out of health now; but that indeed, by her own account, she has always been. i would not say so to every body, mrs. elton, but i have not much faith in mrs. churchill’s illness.”
“if she is really ill, why not go to bath, mr. weston?—to bath, or to clifton?” “she has taken it into her head that enscombe is too

 cold for her. the fact is, i suppose, that she is tired of enscombe. she has now been a longer time stationary there, than she ever was before, and she begins to want change. it is a retired place. a fine place, but very retired.”
“aye—like maple grove, i dare say. nothing can stand more retired from the road than maple grove. such an immense plantation all round it! you seem shut out from every thing—in the most complete retirement.—and mrs. churchill probably has not health or spirits like selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion. or, perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life. i always say a woman cannot have too many resources—and i feel very thankful that i have so many myself as to be quite independent of society.”
“frank was here in february for a fortnight.”
“so i remember to have heard. he will find an addition to the society of highbury when he comes again; that is, if i may presu

she was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and mr. weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on.
“you were mentioning may. may is the very month which mrs. churchill is ordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place than enscombe—in short, to spend in london; so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from frank the whole spring—precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it: days almost at the longest; weather genial and pleasant, always inviting one out, and never too hot for exercise. when he was here before, we made the best of it; but there was a good deal of wet, damp, cheerless weather; there a

“and i assure you, mr. weston, i have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour. i have heard so much in praise of mr. frank churchill.—at the same time it is fair to observe, that i am one of those who always judge for themselves, and are by no means implicitly guided by others. i give you notice that as i find your son, so i shall judge of him.—i am no flatterer.”
mr. weston was musing.
“i hope,” said he presently, “i have not been severe upon poor mrs. churchill. if she is ill i should be sorry to do her injustice; but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the

volume iii





chapter i

a very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy emma as to the nature of her agitation on hearing this news of frank churchill. she was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed; it was for him. her own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of;—but if he, who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two, were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away, it would be very distressing. if a separation of two months should not have cooled him, there were dangers and evils before her

ragement of his.
she wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration. that would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance! and yet, she could not help rather anticipating something decisive. she felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis, an event, a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state.
it was not very long, though rather longer than mr. weston had foreseen, before she had the power of forming some opinion of frank churchill’s feelings. the enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been imagined, but he was at highbury very soon afterwards. he rode down for a couple of hours; he could not yet do more; but as he came from randalls immediately to hartfield, she could then exercise all her quick observation, and speedily determine how he was influenced, and how she must act. they met with the utmost friendliness. there could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her. but she had an almost instant d

ould not stop for more than a word—but he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call, and much as he wished to stay longer at hartfield, he must hurry off.” she had no doubt as to his being less in love—but neither his agitated spirits, nor his hurrying away, seemed like a perfect cure; and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power, and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long.
this was the only visit from frank churchill in the course of ten days. he was often hoping, intending to come—but was always prevented. his aunt could not bear to have him leave her. such was his own account at randall’s. if he were quite sincere, if he really tried to come, it was to be inferred that mrs. churchill’s removal to london had been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder. that she was really ill was very certain; he had declared himself convinced of it, at randalls. though much might be fancy, he co

t she might not have many years of existence before her; but he could not be prevailed on, by all his father’s doubts, to say that her complaints were merely imaginary, or that she was as strong as ever.
it soon appeared that london was not the place for her. she could not endure its noise. her nerves were under continual irritation and suffering; and by the ten days’ end, her nephew’s letter to randalls communicated a change of plan. they were going to remove immediately to richmond. mrs. churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of an eminent person there, and had otherwise a fancy for the place. a ready-furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged, and much benefit expected from the change.
emma heard that frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement, and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends—for the house was taken for may and june. she was told that now he wrote with the gre

et away, the day would be spent in coming and returning. there was no comfort in having him in london; he might as well be at enscombe; but richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse. better than nearer!
one good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal,—the ball at the crown. it had not been forgotten before, but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day. now, however, it was absolutely to be; every preparation was resumed, and very soon after the churchills had removed to richmond, a few lines from frank, to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change, and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty-four hours at any given time, induced them to name as early a day as possible.
mr. weston’s ball was to be a real thing. a very few to-morrows stood between the young people of highbury and happiness.

no misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball. the day approached, the day arrived; and after a morning of some anxious watching, frank churchill, in all the certainty of his own self, reached randalls before dinner, and every thing was safe.
no second meeting had there yet been between him and emma. the room at the crown was to witness it;—but it would be better than a common meeting in a crowd. mr. weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves, for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came, that she could

 not refuse him, and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man’s company. she was to convey harriet, and they drove to the crown in good time, the randalls party just sufficiently before them.
frank churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he did not say much, his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening. they all walked about together, to see that every thing was as it should be; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another carriage, which emma could not hear the sound of at first, without great surprize. “so unreasonably early!” she was going to exclaim; but she presently found that it was a family of old friends, who were coming, like herself,

frank churchill returned to his station by emma; and as soon as miss bates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of mrs. elton and miss fairfax, who were standing a little way behind her.—he was thoughtful. whether he were overhearing too, she could not determine. after a good many compliments to jane on her dress and look, compliments very quietly and properly taken, mrs. elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself—and it was, “how do you like my gown?—how do yo
 
 ___________________________
 
u like my trimming?—how has wright done my hair?”—with many other relative questions, all answered with patient politeness. mrs. elton then said, “nobody can think less of dress in general than i do—but upon such an occasion as this, when every body’s eyes are so much upon me, and in compliment to the westons—who i have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour—i would not wish to be inferior to others. and i see very few pearls in the room except mine.—so frank churchill is a capital dancer, i understand.—we shall see if our styles suit.—a fine young man certainly is frank churchill. i like him very well.”
at this moment frank began talking so vigorously, that emma could not but imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want to hear more;—and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while, till another suspension brought mrs. elton’s tones again distinctly forward.—mr. elton had just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming,
“oh! yo

u have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?—i was this moment telling jane, i thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us.”
“jane!”—repeated frank churchill, with a look of surprize and displeasure.—“that is easy—but miss fairfax does not disapprove it, i suppose.”
“how do you like mrs. elton?” said emma in a whisper.
“not at all.”
“you are ungrateful.”
“ungrateful!—what do you mean?” then changing from a frown to a smile—“no, do not tell me—i do not want to know what you mean.—where is my father?—when are we to begin dancing?”
emma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour. he walked off to find

and what are we to do for a proper partner for her?” said mr. weston. “she will think frank ought to ask her.”
frank turned instantly to emma, to claim her former promise; and boasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most perfect approbation of—and it then appeared that mrs. weston was wanting him to dance with mrs. elton himself, and that their business was to help to persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.—mr. weston and mrs. elton led the way, mr. frank churchill and miss woodhouse followed. emma must submit to stand second to mrs. elton, though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her. it was almost enough to make her think of marrying. mrs. elton had undoubtedly the advantage, at this time, in vanity completely gratified; for though she had intended to begin with frank churchill, she could not lose by the change. mr. weston might be his son’s superior.—in spite of this little rub, however, emma was smiling with enjoyment, delighted

uch as emma felt must draw every body’s eyes; and, excepting her own partner, there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him.—he moved a few steps nearer, and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner, with what natural grace, he must have danced, would he but take the trouble.—whenever she caught his eye, she forced him to smile; but in general he was looking grave. she wished he could love a ballroom better, and could like frank churchill better.—he seemed often observing her. she must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour, she did not feel afraid. there was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner. they seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, than lovers. that frank churchill thought less of her than he had done, was indubitable.
the ball proceeded pleasantly. the anxious cares, the incessant attentions of mrs. weston, were not thrown away. every body seemed h

supper was announced. the move began; and miss bates might be heard from that moment, without interruption, till her being seated at table and taking up her spoon.
“jane, jane, my dear jane, where are you?—here is your tippet. mrs. weston begs you to put on your tippet. she says she is afraid there will be draughts in the passage, though every thing has been done—one door nailed up—quantities of matting—my dear jane, indeed you must. mr. churchill, oh! you are too obliging! how well you put it on!—so gratified! excellent dancing indeed!—yes, my dear, i ran home, as i said i should, to help grandmama to bed, and got back again, and nobody missed me.—i set off without saying a word, just as i told you. grandmama was quite well, had a charming evening with mr. woodhouse, a vast deal of chat, and backgammon.—tea was made downstairs, biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away: amazing luck in some of her throws: and she i

emma had no opportunity of speaking to mr. knightley till after supper; but, when they were all in the ballroom again, her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked. he was warm in his reprobation of

f speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom, she had strong hopes. it seemed as if her eyes were suddenly opened, and she were enabled to see that mr. elton was not the superior creature she had believed him. the fever was over, and emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious courtesy. she depended on the evil feelings of the eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisite.—harriet rational, frank churchill not too much in love, and mr. knightley not wanting to quarrel with her, how very happy a summer must be before her!
she was not to see frank churchill this morning. he had told her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at hartfield, as he was to be at home by the middle of the day. she did not regret it.
having arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put them all to rights, she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up for the demands of the two li

in this state frank churchill had found her, she trembling and conditioning, they loud and insolent. by a most fortunate chance his leaving highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance at this critical moment. the pleasantness of the morning had induced him to walk forward, and leave his horses to meet him by another road, a mile or two beyond highbury—and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before of miss bates, and to have forgotten to restore them, he had been obliged to stop at he

“and had you really some at hand yourself? i am sure i never suspected it, you did it so naturally.”
“and so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his sake!” said emma, recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement. and secretly she added to herself, “lord bless me! when should i ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court-plaister that frank churchill had been pulling about! i never was equal to this.”
“here,” resumed harriet, turning to her box again, “here is something still more valuable, i mean that has been more valuable, because this is what did really once belong to him, which the court-plaister never did.”
emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure. it was the end of an old pencil,—the part without any lead.
“this was really his,” said harriet.—“do not you remember one morning?—no, i dare say you do not.

“but, harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?—i have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister might be useful.”
“i shall be happier to burn it,” replied harriet. “it has a disagreeable look to me. i must get rid of every thing.—there it goes, and there is an end, thank heaven! of mr. elton.”
“and when,” thought emma, “will there be a beginning of mr. churchill?”
she had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though she had told no fortune, might be proved to have made harriet’s.—about a fortnight after the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation, and quite undesignedly. emma was not thinking of it at the moment, which made the information she received more valuable. she merely said, in the course of some trivial chat, “well, harriet, whenever you marry i would advise

mr. knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, had certainly taken an early dislike to frank churchill, was only growing to dislike him more. he began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of emma. that emma was his object appeared indisputable. every thing declared it; his own attentions, his father’s hints, his mother-in-law’s guarded silence; it was all in unison; words, conduct, discretion, and indiscretion, told the same story. but while so many were devoting him to emma, and emma herself making him over to harriet, mr. knightley began to suspect him of some inclination t

he had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did, to spend his evening at hartfield. emma and harriet were going to walk; he joined them; and, on returning, they fell in with a larger party, who, like themselves, judged it wisest to take their exercise early, as the weather threatened rain; mr. and mrs. weston and their son, miss bates and her niece, who had accidentally met. they all united; and, on reaching hartfield gates, emma, who knew it was exactly the sort of visiti

ng that would be welcome to her father, pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him. the randalls party agreed to it immediately; and after a pretty long speech from miss bates, which few persons listened to, she also found it possible to accept dear miss woodhouse’s most obliging invitation.
as they were turning into the grounds, mr. perry passed by on horseback. the gentlemen spoke of his horse.
“by the bye,” said frank churchill to mrs. weston presently, “what became of mr. perry’s plan of setting up his carriage?”
mrs. weston looked surprized, and said, “i did not know that he ever had any such plan.”
“nay, i had it from you. you wrote me word of it three months ago.”
“me! impossible!”
“indeed you did. i remember it perfectly. you mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon. mrs. perry had told somebody, and was extremely happy about it. it was owing to her persuasion, as she thought his bei

 heap of absurdities it is! well, frank, your dream certainly shews that highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent. emma, you are a great dreamer, i think?”
emma was out of hearing. she had hurried on before her guests to prepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach of mr. weston’s hint.
“why, to own the truth,” cried miss bates, who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes, “if i must speak on this subject, there is no denying that mr. frank churchill might have—i do not mean to say that he did not dream it—i am sure i have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world—but if i am questioned about it, i must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring; for mrs. perry herself mentioned it to my mother, and the coles knew of it as well as ourselves—but it was quite a secret, known to nobody else, and only thought of about three days. mrs. perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage, and came to my mother in great spirits o

they were entering the hall. mr. knightley’s eyes had preceded miss bates’s in a glance at jane. from frank churchill’s face, where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away, he had involuntarily turned to hers; but she was indeed behind, and too busy with her shawl. mr. weston had walked in. the two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass. mr. knightley suspected in frank churchill the determination of catching her eye—he seemed watching her intently—in vain, however, if it were so—jane passed between them into the hall, and looked at neither.

rk or explanation. the dream must be borne with, and mr. knightley must take his seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which emma had introduced at hartfield, and which none but emma could have had power to place there and persuade her father to use, instead of the small-sized pembroke, on which two of his daily meals had, for forty years been crowded. tea passed pleasantly, and nobody seemed in a hurry to move.
“miss woodhouse,” said frank churchill, after examining a table behind him, which he could reach as he sat, “have your nephews taken away their alphabets—their box of letters? it used to stand here. where is it? this is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer. we had great amusement with those letters one morning. i want to puzzle you again.”
emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much di

they were rapidly forming words for each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled. the quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for mr. woodhouse, who had often been distressed by the more animated sort, which mr. weston had occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting, with tender melancholy, over the departure of the “poor little boys,” or in fondly pointing out, as he took up any stray letter near him, how beautifully emma had written it.
frank churchill placed a word before miss fairfax. she gave a slight glance round the table, and applied herself to it. frank was next to emma, jane opposite to them—and mr. knightley so placed as to see them all; and it was his object to see as much as he could, with as little apparent observation. the word was discovered, and with a faint smile pushed away. if meant to be immediately mixed with the others, and buried from sight, she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across, for it was

 blush on jane’s cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible. mr. knightley connected it with the dream; but how it could all be, was beyond his comprehension. how the delicacy, the discretion of his favourite could have been so lain asleep! he feared there must be some decided involvement. disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn. these letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick. it was a child’s play, chosen to conceal a deeper game on frank churchill’s part.
with great indignation did he continue to observe him; with great alarm and distrust, to observe also his two blinded companions. he saw a short word prepared for emma, and given to her with a look sly and demure. he saw that emma had soon made it out, and found it highly entertaining, though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure; for she said, “nonsense! for shame!” he heard frank churchill next say, with a glance towards jane, “i will give it to her

ing in, and grandmama will be looking for us. my dear sir, you are too obliging. we really must wish you good night.”
jane’s alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived. she was immediately up, and wanting to quit the table; but so many were also moving, that she could not get away; and mr. knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her, and resolutely swept away by her unexamined. she was afterwards looking for her shawl—frank churchill was looking also—it was growing dusk, and the room was in confusion; and how they parted, mr. knightley could not tell.
he remained at hartfield after all the rest, his thoughts full of what he had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist his observations, he must—yes, he certainly must, as a friend—an anxious friend—give emma some hint, ask her some question. he could not see her in a situation of such danger, without trying to preserve her. it was his duty.
“pray, emma,

emma was extremely confused. she could not endure to give him the true explanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed, she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them.
“oh!” she cried in evident embarrassment, “it all meant nothing; a mere joke among ourselves.”
“the joke,” he replied gravely, “seemed confined to you and mr. churchill.”
he had hoped she would speak again, but she did not. she would rather busy herself about any thing than speak. he sat a little while in doubt. a variety of evils crossed his mind. interference—fruitless interference. emma’s confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy, seemed to declare her affection engaged. yet he would speak. he owed it to her, to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference, rather than her welfare; to encounter any thing, rather than the remembran

“my dear emma,” said he at last, with earnest kindness, “do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of?”
“between mr. frank churchill and miss fairfax? oh! yes, perfectly.—why do you make a doubt of it?”
“have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her, or that she admired him?”
“never, never!” she cried with a most open eagerness—“never, for the twentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to me. and how could it possibly come into your head?”

chapter vi

after being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from mr. and mrs. suckling, the highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn. no such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at present. in the daily interchange of news, they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the sucklings’ coming had been united, such as the last accounts of mrs. churchill, whose health seemed every day to supply a different report, and the situation of mrs. weston, whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child, as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it.
mrs. elton was very much disappointed. it was the delay of a great deal of pleasure and parade. her introductions and recommendations must all wait, and every projected party be still only talked of. so she thought at first;—but a little conside

 increasing respect for it, as the residence of a family of such true gentility, untainted in blood and understanding.—some faults of temper john knightley had; but isabella had connected herself unexceptionably. she had given them neither men, nor names, nor places, that could raise a blush. these were pleasant feelings, and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did, and collect round the strawberry-beds.—the whole party were assembled, excepting frank churchill, who was expected every moment from richmond; and mrs. elton, in all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet and her basket, was very ready to lead the way in gathering, accepting, or talking—strawberries, and only strawberries, could now be thought or spoken of.—“the best fruit in england—every body’s favourite—always wholesome.—these the finest beds and finest sorts.—delightful to gather for one’s self—the only way of really enjoying them.—morning decidedly the best

 seemed to say, “these are my own concerns. i have a right to talk on such subjects, without being suspected of introducing robert martin.”—she did not suspect him. it was too old a story.—robert martin had probably ceased to think of harriet.—they took a few turns together along the walk.—the shade was most refreshing, and emma found it the pleasantest part of the day.
the next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;—and they were all seated and busy, and still frank churchill did not come. mrs. weston looked, and looked in vain. his father would not own himself uneasy, and laughed at her fears; but she could not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare. he had expressed himself as to coming, with more than common certainty. “his aunt was so much better, that he had not a doubt of getting over to them.”—mrs. churchill’s state, however, as many were ready to remind her, was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the

 most reasonable dependence—and mrs. weston was at last persuaded to believe, or to say, that it must be by some attack of mrs. churchill that he was prevented coming.—emma looked at harriet while the point was under consideration; she behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion.
the cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more to see what had not yet been seen, the old abbey fish-ponds; perhaps get as far as the clover, which was to be begun cutting on the morrow, or, at any rate, have the pleasure of being hot, and growing cool again.—mr. woodhouse, who had already taken his little round in the highest part o

“such a home, indeed! such an aunt!” said emma, as she turned back into the hall again. “i do pity you. and the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors, the more i shall like you.”
jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had only accomplished some views of st. mark’s place, venice, when frank churchill entered the room. emma had not been thinking of him, she had forgotten to think of him—but she was very glad to see him. mrs. weston would be at ease. the black mare was blameless; they were right who had named mrs. churchill as the cause. he had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her; a nervous seizure, which had lasted some hours—and he had quite given up every thought of coming, till very late;—and had he known how hot a ride he should have, and how late, with all his

 he sat down, at the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of mr. woodhouse’s fire, looking very deplorable.
“you will soon be cooler, if you sit still,” said emma.
“as soon as i am cooler i shall go back again. i could very ill be spared—but such a point had been made of my coming! you will all be going soon i suppose; the whole party breaking up. i met one as i came—madness in such weather!—absolute madness!”
emma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that frank churchill’s state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour. some people were always cross when they were hot. such might be his constitution; and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints, she recommended his taking some refreshment; he would find abundance of every thing in the dining-room—and she humanely pointed out the door.
“no—he should not eat. he was not hungry; it would only make him hotter.” in two minutes, howe

“no—it will not be worth while. if i come, i shall be cross.”
“then pray stay at richmond.”
“but if i do, i shall be crosser still. i can never bear to think of you all there without me.”
“these are difficulties which you must settle for yourself. chuse your own degree of crossness. i shall press you no more.”
the rest of the party were now returning, and all were soon collected. with some there was great joy at the sight of frank churchill; others took it very composedly; but there was a very general distress and disturbance on miss fairfax’s disappearance being explained. that it was time for every body to go, concluded the subject; and with a short final arrangement for the next day’s scheme, they parted. frank churchill’s little inclination to exclude himself increased so much, that his last words to emma were,
“well;—if you wish me to stay and join the party, i will.”
she smiled her acceptance; and nothing less th

emained with mr. woodhouse. nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there. seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment, and every body had a burst of admiration on first arriving; but in the general amount of the day there was deficiency. there was a languor, a want of spirits, a want of union, which could not be got over. they separated too much into parties. the eltons walked together; mr. knightley took charge of miss bates and jane; and emma and harriet belonged to frank churchill. and mr. weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise better. it seemed at first an accidental division, but it never materially varied. mr. and mrs. elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness to mix, and be as agreeable as they could; but during the two whole hours that were spent on the hill, there seemed a principle of separation, between the other parties, too strong for any fine prospects, or any cold collation, or any cheerful mr. weston, to remove.
at first it was downright dulness to emma.

 she had never seen frank churchill so silent and stupid. he said nothing worth hearing—looked without seeing—admired without intelligence—listened without knowing what she said. while he was so dull, it was no wonder that harriet should be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable.
when they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great deal better, for frank churchill grew talkative and gay, making her his first object. every distinguishing attention that could be paid, was paid to her. to amuse her, and be agreeable in her eyes, seemed all that he cared for—and emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry to be flattered, was gay and easy too, and gave him all the friendly encouragement, the admission to be gallant, which she had ever given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance; but which now, in her own estimation, meant nothing, though i

n the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no english word but flirtation could very well describe. “mr. frank churchill and miss woodhouse flirted together excessively.” they were laying themselves open to that very phrase—and to having it sent off in a letter to maple grove by one lady, to ireland by another. not that emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity; it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected. she laughed because she was disappointed; and though she liked him for his attentions, and thought them all, whether in friendship, admiration, or playfulness, extremely judici

miss fairfax, who had seldom spoken before, except among her own confederates, spoke now.
“such things do occur, undoubtedly.”—she was stopped by a cough. frank churchill turned towards her to listen.
“you were speaking,” said he, gravely. she recovered her voice.
“i was only going to observe, that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women, i cannot imagine them to be very frequent. a hasty and imprudent attachment may arise—but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards. i would be understood to mean, that it can be only weak, irresolute characters, (whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance,)

miss bates would hardly give emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her; but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of mr. frank churchill’s going, she proceeded to give them all, it was of no consequence.
what mr. elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being the accumulation of the ostler’s own knowledge, and the k

nowledge of the servants at randalls, was, that a messenger had come over from richmond soon after the return of the party from box hill—which messenger, however, had been no more than was expected; and that mr. churchill had sent his nephew a few lines, containing, upon the whole, a tolerable account of mrs. churchill, and only wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early; but that mr. frank churchill having resolved to go home directly, without waiting at all, and his horse seeming to have got a cold, tom had been sent off immediately for the crown chaise, and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boy going a good pace, and driving very steady.
there was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest, and it caught emma’s attention only as it united with the subject which already engaged her mind. the contrast between mrs. churchill’s importance in the world, and jane fa

the following day brought news from richmond to throw every thing else into the background. an express arrived at randalls to announce the death of mrs. churchill! though her nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account, she had not lived above six-and-thirty hours after his return. a sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded by her general state, had carried her off after a short struggle. the great mrs. churchill was no more.
it was felt as such things must be felt. every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow; tenderness towards the departed, solicitude for the surviving friends; and, in a reasonable time, cur

iosity to know where she would be buried. goldsmith tells us, that when lovely woman stoops to folly, she has nothing to do but to die; and when she stoops to be disagreeable, it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame. mrs. churchill, after being disliked at least twenty-five years, was now spoken of with compassionate allowances. in one point she was fully justified. she had never been admitted before to be seriously ill. the event acquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints.

what would mr. churchill do without her? mr. churchill’s loss would be dreadful indeed. mr. churchill would never get over it.”—even mr. weston shook his head, and looked solemn, and said, “ah! poor woman, who would have thought it!” and resolved, that his mourning should be as handsome as possible; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense, true and steady. how it would affect frank was among the earliest thoughts of both. it was also a very early speculation with emma. the character of mrs. churchill, the grief of her husband—her

 mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion—and then rested with lightened feelings on how frank might be affected by the event, how benefited, how freed. she saw in a moment all the possible good. now, an attachment to harriet smith would have nothing to encounter. mr. churchill, independent of his wife, was feared by nobody; an easy, guidable man, to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew. all that remained to be wished was, that the nephew should form the attachment, as, with all her goodwill in the cause, emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed.
harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with great self-command. what ever she might feel of brighter hope, she betrayed nothing. emma was gratified, to observe such a proof in her of strengthened

 character, and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance. they spoke, therefore, of mrs. churchill’s death with mutual forbearance.
short letters from frank were received at randalls, communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans. mr. churchill was better than could be expected; and their first removal, on the departure of the funeral for yorkshire, was to be to the house of a very old friend in windsor, to whom mr. churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years. at present, there was nothing to be done for harriet; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on emma’s side.
it was a more pressing concern to shew attention to jane fairfax, whose prospects were closing, while harriet’s opened, and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at highbury, who wished to shew her kindness—and with emma it was grown into a first wish. she had scarcely a stronger regret than for h

, and inequality of powers; and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling, or esteemed so little worthy as a friend: but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good, and of being able to say to herself, that could mr. knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting jane fairfax, could he even have seen into her heart, he would not, on this occasion, have found any thing to reprove.




chapter x

one morning, about ten days after mrs. churchill’s decease, emma was called downstairs to mr. weston, who “could not stay five minutes, and wanted particularly to speak with her.”—he met her at the parlour-door, and hardly asking her how she did, in the natural key of his voice, sunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her father,
“can you come to randalls at any time this morning?—do, if it be possible. mrs. weston wants to see you. she must see you.”
“is she unwell?”
“no, no, not at all—only a little agitated. she would

“have you indeed no idea?” said mrs. weston in a trembling voice. “cannot you, my dear emma—cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear?”
“so far as that it relates to mr. frank churchill, i do guess.”
“you are right. it does relate to him, and i will tell you directly;” (resuming her work, and seeming resolved against looking up.) “he has been here this very morning, on a most extraordinary errand. it is impossible to express our surprize. he came to speak to his father on a subject,—to announce an attachment—”
she stopped to breathe. emma thought first of herself, and then of harriet.
“more than an attachment, indeed,” resumed mrs. weston; “an engagement—

a positive engagement.—what will you say, emma—what will any body say, when it is known that frank churchill and miss fairfax are engaged;—nay, that they have been long engaged!”
emma even jumped with surprize;—and, horror-struck, exclaimed,
“jane fairfax!—good god! you are not serious? you do not mean it?”
“you may well be amazed,” returned mrs. weston, still averting her eyes, and talking on with eagerness, that emma might have time to recover— “you may well be amazed. but it is even so. there has been a solemn engagement between them ever since october—formed at weymouth, and

“his sufferings,” replied emma dryly, “do not appear to have done him much harm. well, and how did mr. churchill take it?”
“most favourably for his nephew—gave his consent with scarcely a difficulty. conceive what the events of a week have done in that family! while poor mrs. churchill lived, i suppose there could not have been a hope, a chance, a possibility;—but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault, than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required. what a blessing it is, when undue influence does not survive the grave!—he gave his consent wi

at this moment mr. weston appeared at a little distance from the window, evidently on the watch. his wife gave him a look which invited him in; and, while he was coming round, added, “now, dearest emma, let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease, and incline him to be satisfied with the match. let us make the best of it—and, indeed, almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour. it is not a connexion to gratify; but if mr. churchill does not feel that, why should we? and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him, for frank, i mean, that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as i have always given her credit for—and still am disposed to give her credit for, in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right. and how much may be said in her situation for even that error!”
“much, indeed!” cried emma feelingly. “if a woman can ever be excused

chapter xi

“harriet, poor harriet!”—those were the words; in them lay the tormenting ideas which emma could not get rid of, and which constituted the real misery of the business to her. frank churchill had behaved very ill by herself—very ill in many ways,—but it was not so much his behaviour as her own, which made her so angry with him. it was the scrape which he had drawn her into on harriet’s account, that gave the deepest hue to his offence.—poor harriet! to be a second time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery. mr. knightley had spoken prophetically, when he once said, “emma, you have been no friend to harriet smith.”—she was afraid she had done her nothing but disse

rvice.—it was true that she had not to charge herself, in this instance as in the former, with being the sole and original author of the mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered harriet’s imagination; for harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of frank churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject; but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed. she might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments. her influence would have been enough. and now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them.—she felt that she had been risking her friend’s happiness on most insufficient grounds. common sense would have directed her to tell harriet, that she must not allow herself to t

she was extremely angry with herself. if she could not have been angry with frank churchill too, it would have been dreadful.—as for jane fairfax, she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account. harriet would be anxiety enough; she need no longer be unhappy about jane, whose troubles and whose ill-health having, of course, the same origin, must be equally under cure.—her days of insignificance and evil were over.—she would soon be well, and happy, and prosperous.—emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted. this discovery

 any body else. emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first. considering the very superior claims of the object, it ought; and judging by its apparently stronger effect on harriet’s mind, producing reserve and self-command, it would.—she must communicate the painful truth, however, and as soon as possible. an injunction of secresy had been among mr. weston’s parting words. “for the present, the whole affair was to be completely a secret. mr. churchill had made a point of it, as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost; and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum.”—emma had promised; but still harriet must be excepted. it was her superior duty.
in spite of her vexation, she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous, that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by harriet, which mrs. weston had just gone through by herself. the intelligence, which had been so anxiously ann

“about jane fairfax. did you ever hear any thing so strange? oh!—you need not be afraid of owning it to me, for mr. weston has told me himself. i met him just now. he told me it was to be a great secret; and, therefore, i should not think of mentioning it to any body but you, but he said you knew it.”
“what did mr. weston tell you?”—said emma, still perplexed.
“oh! he told me all about it; that jane fairfax and mr. frank churchill are to be married, and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while. how very odd!”
it was, indeed, so odd; harriet’s behaviour was so extremely odd, that emma did not know how to understand it. her character appeared absolutely changed. she seemed to propose shewing no agitation, or disappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery. emma looked at her, quite unable to speak.
“had you any idea,” cried harriet, “of his being in love with her?—you, perhaps,

might.—you (blushing as she spoke) who can see into every body’s heart; but nobody else—”
“upon my word,” said emma, “i begin to doubt my having any such talent. can you seriously ask me, harriet, whether i imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that i was—tacitly, if not openly—encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?—i never had the slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of mr. frank churchill’s having the least regard for jane fairfax. you may be very sure that if i had, i should have cautioned you accordingly.”
“me!” cried harriet, colouring, and astonished. “why should you caution me?—you do not think i care about mr. frank churchill.”
“i am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,” replied emma, smiling; “but you do not mean to deny that there was a time—and not very distant either—when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about

harriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned from her, did not immediately say any thing; and when she did speak, it was in a voice nearly as agitated as emma’s.
“i should not have thought it possible,” she began, “that you could have misunderstood me! i know we agreed never to name him—but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else, i should not have thought it possible that i could be supposed to mean any other person. mr. frank churchill, indeed! i do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other. i hope i have a better taste than to think of mr. frank churchill, who is like nobody by his side. and that you should have been so mistaken, is amazing!—i am sure, but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment, i should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost, to dare to think of him. at first, if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happen

 cried emma, collecting herself resolutely—“let us understand each other now, without the possibility of farther mistake. are you speaking of—mr. knightley?”
“to be sure i am. i never could have an idea of any body else—and so i thought you knew. when we talked about him, it was as clear as possible.”
“not quite,” returned emma, with forced calmness, “for all that you then said, appeared to me to relate to a different person. i could almost assert that you had named mr. frank churchill. i am sure the service mr. frank churchill had rendered you, in protecting you from the gipsies, was spoken of.”
“oh! miss woodhouse, how you do forget!”
“my dear harriet, i perfectly remember the substance of what i said on the occasion. i told you that i did not wonder at your attachment; that considering the service he had rendered you, it was extremely natural:—and you agreed to it, expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service, and mentioning even what your sen

sations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue.—the impression of it is strong on my memory.”
“oh, dear,” cried harriet, “now i recollect what you mean; but i was thinking of something very different at the time. it was not the gipsies—it was not mr. frank churchill that i meant. no! (with some elevation) i was thinking of a much more precious circumstance—of mr. knightley’s coming and asking me to dance, when mr. elton would not stand up with me; and when there was no other partner in the room. that was the kind action; that was the noble benevolence and generosity; that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth.”
“good god!” cried emma, “this has been a most unfortunate—most deplorable m

she paused a few moments. emma could not speak.
“i do not wonder, miss woodhouse,” she resumed, “that you should feel a great difference between the two, as to me or as to any body. you must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other. but i hope, miss woodhouse, that supposing—that if—strange as it may appear—. but you know they were your own words, that more wonderful things had happened, matches of greater disparity had taken place than between mr. frank churchill and me; and, therefore, it seems as if such a thing even as this, may have occurred before—and if i should be so fortunate, beyond expression, as to—if mr. knightley should really—if he does not mind the disparity, i hope, dear miss woodhouse, you will not set yourself against it, and try to put difficulties in the way. but you are too good for that, i am sure.”
harriet was standing at one of the windows. emma turned round to look at her in consternation, and hastily said,
“have you a

“yes,” replied harriet modestly, but not fearfully—“i must say that i have.”
emma’s eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she sat silently meditating, in a fixed attitude, for a few minutes. a few minutes were sufficient for making her acquainted with her own heart. a mind like hers, once opening to suspicion, made rapid progress. she touched—she admitted—she acknowledged the whole truth. why was it so much worse that harriet should be in love with mr. knightley, than with frank churchill? why was the evil so dreadfully increased by harriet’s having some hope of a return? it darted through her, with the speed of an arrow, that mr. knightley must marry no one but herself!
her own conduct, as well as her own heart, was before her in the same few minutes. she saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed her before. how improperly had she been acting by harriet! how inconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational, how unfeeling had been her conduct! what blindness, what madne

she was wretched, and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness.
to understand, thoroughly understand her own heart, was the first endeavour. to that point went every leisure moment which her father’s claims on her allowed, and every moment of involuntary absence of mind.
how long had mr. knightley been so dear to her, as every feeling declared him now to be? when had his influence, such influence begun?— when had he succeeded to that place in her affection, which frank churchill had once, for a short period, occupied?—she looked back; she compared the two—compared them, as they had always stood in her estimation, from the time of the latter’s becoming known to her—and as they must at any time have been compared by her, had it—oh! had it, by any blessed felicity, occurred to her, to institute the comparison.—she saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider mr. knightley as infinitely the superior, or when his regard for her had not been inf

initely the most dear. she saw, that in persuading herself, in fancying, in acting to the contrary, she had been entirely under a delusion, totally ignorant of her own heart—and, in short, that she had never really cared for frank churchill at all!
this was the conclusion of the first series of reflection. this was the knowledge of herself, on the first question of inquiry, which she reached; and without being long in reaching it.—she was most sorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her—her affection for mr. knightley.—every other part of her mind was disgusting.
with insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body’s feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed t

mr. knightley and harriet smith!—it was a union to distance every wonder of the kind.—the attachment of frank churchill and jane fairfax became commonplace, threadbare, stale in the comparison, exciting no surprize, presenting no disparity, affording nothing to be said or thought.—mr. knightley and harriet smith!—such an elevation on her side! such a debasement on his! it was horrible to emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion, to foresee the smiles, the sneers, the merriment it would prompt at his expense; the mortification and disdain of his brother, the thousand inconveniences to himself

a little curiosity emma had; and she made the most of it while her friend related. mrs. weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself; and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present, to be allowed merely to write to miss fairfax instead, and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed, and mr. churchill could be reconciled to the engagement’s becoming known; as, considering every thing, she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports:—but mr. weston had thought differently; he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to miss fairfax and her family, and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it; or if it were, that it would be of any consequence; for “such things,” he observed, “always got about.” emma smiled, and felt that mr. weston had

ed into miss fairfax’s confidence on this important matter—which was most probable—still, in knowing her as she ought, and as she might, she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to mr. dixon, which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so unpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of jane’s feelings, by the levity or carelessness of frank churchill’s. of all the sources of evil surrounding the former, since her coming to highbury, she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst. she must have been a perpetual enemy. they never could have been all three together, without her having stabbed jane fairfax’s peace in a thousand instances; and on box hill, perhaps, it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no more.

the child to be born at randalls must be a tie there even dearer than herself; and mrs. weston’s heart and time would be occupied by it. they should lose her; and, probably, in great measure, her husband also.—frank churchill would return among them no more; and miss fairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease to belong to highbury. they would be married, and settled either at or near enscombe. all that were good would be withdrawn; and if to these losses, the loss of donwell were to be added, what would remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach? mr. knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort!—no longer walking in at all hours, as if ever willing to change his own

“you have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will rather surprize you.”
“have i?” said he quietly, and looking at her; “of what nature?”
“oh! the best nature in the world—a wedding.”
after waiting a moment, as if to be sure she intended to say no more, he replied,
“if you mean miss fairfax and frank churchill, i have heard that already.”
“how is it possible?” cried emma, turning her glowing cheeks towards him; for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he might have called at mrs. goddard’s in his way.
“i had a few lines on parish business from mr. weston this morning, and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened.”
emma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little more composure,
“you probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you h

she had hoped for an answer here—for a few words to say that her conduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, as far as she could judge, deep in thought. at last, and tolerably in his usual tone, he said,
“i have never had a high opinion of frank churchill.—i can suppose, however, that i may have underrated him. my acquaintance with him has been but trifling.—and even if i have not underrated him hitherto, he may yet turn out well.—with such a woman he has a chance.—i have no motive for wishing him ill—and for her sake, whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct, i shall certainly wish him well.”
“i have no doubt of their being happy together,” said emma; “i believe them to be very mutually and very since

 can it happen that something is not a little disguised, or a little mistaken; but where, as in this case, though the conduct is mistaken, the feelings are not, it may not be very material.—mr. knightley could not impute to emma a more relenting heart than she possessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of his.
he had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence. he had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it. he had come, in his anxiety to see how she bore frank churchill’s engagement, with no selfish view, no view at all, but of endeavouring, if she allowed him an opening, to soothe or to counsel her.—the rest had been the work of the moment, the immediate effect of what he heard, on his feelings. the delightful assurance of her total indifference towards frank churchill, of her having a heart completely disengaged from him, had given birth to the hope, that, in time, he might gain her affection himself;—but it had been no present hope—he had only, in t

her change was equal.—this one half-hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.—on his side, there had been a long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival, or even the expectation, of frank churchill.—he had been in love with emma, and jealous of frank churchill, from about the same period, one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other. it was his jealousy of frank churchill that had taken him from the country.—the box hill party had decided him on going away. he would save himself from witnessing again such permitted, encouraged attentions.—he had gone to learn to be indifferent.—but he had gone to a wrong place. there was too much domestic happiness in his brother

he had not left her long, by no means long enough for her to have the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else, when a letter was brought her from randalls—a very thick letter;—she guessed what it must contain, and deprecated the necessity of reading it.—she was now in perfect charity with frank churchill; she wanted no explanations, she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself—and as for understanding any thing he wrote, she was sure she was incapable of it.—it must be waded through, however. she opened the packet; it was too surely so;—a note from mrs. weston to herself, ushered in the letter from frank to mrs. weston.

this letter must make its way to emma’s feelings. she was obliged, in spite of her previous determination to the contrary, to do it all the justice that mrs. weston foretold. as soon as she came to her own name, it was irresistible; every line relating to herself was interesting, and almost every line agreeable; and when this charm ceased, the subject could still maintain itself, by the natural return of her former regard for the writer, and the very strong attraction which a

after this, he made some progress without any pause. frank churchill’s confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing.
“i perfectly agree with you, sir,”—was then his remark. “you did behave very shamefully. you never wrote a truer line.” and having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement, and his persisting to act in direct opposition to jane fairfax’s sense of right, he made a fuller pause to say, “this is very bad.—he had induced her to place herself, for

the subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike english, such as mr. knightley used even to the woman he was in love with, how to be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking the happiness of her father. emma’s answer was ready at the first word. “while her dear father lived, any change of condition must be impossible for her. she could never quit him.” part only of this answ

“oh! as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet. i am here till claimed by colonel and mrs. campbell.”
“nothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps,” replied emma, smiling—“but, excuse me, it must be thought of.”
the smile was returned as jane answered,
“you are very right; it has been thought of. and i will own to you, (i am sure it will be safe), that so far as our living with mr. churchill at enscombe, it is settled. there must be three months, at least, of deep mourning; but when they are over, i imagine there will be nothing more to wait for.”
“thank you, thank you.—this is just what i wanted to be assured of.—oh! if you knew how much i love every thing that is decided and open!—good-bye, good-bye.”

in half a minute they were in the room. emma was extremely glad to see him—but there was a degree of confusion—a number of embarrassing recollections on each side. they met readily and smiling, but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said; and having all sat down again, there was for some time such a blank in the circle, that emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged, which she had long felt, of seeing frank churchill once more, and of seeing him with jane, would yield its proportion of pleasure. when mr. weston joined the party, however, and when the baby was fetched, there was no longer a want of subject or animation—or of courage and opportunity for frank churchill to draw near her and say,
“i have to thank you, miss woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving message in one of mrs. weston’s letters. i hope time has not made you less willing to pardon. i hope you do not retract what you then said.”

as to mr. woodhouse, who commended her very much for thinking of sending for perry, and only regretted that she had not done it. “she should always send for perry, if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered, were it only for a moment. she could not be too soon alarmed, nor send for perry too often. it was a pity, perhaps, that he had not come last night; for, though the child seemed well now, very well considering, it would probably have been better if perry had seen it.”
frank churchill caught the name.
“perry!” said he to emma, and trying, as he spoke, to catch miss fairfax’s eye. “my friend mr. perry! what are they saying about mr. perry?—has he been here this morning?—and how does he travel now?—has he set up his carriage?”
emma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined in the laugh, it was evident from jane’s countenance that she too was really hearing him, though trying to seem deaf.
“such an extraordinary dream of mine!” he cried.

r a moment; and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious, low, yet steady voice,
“how you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!—they will sometimes obtrude—but how you can court them!”
he had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly; but emma’s feelings were chiefly with jane, in the argument; and on leaving randalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men, she felt, that pleased as she had been to see frank churchill, and really regarding him as she did with friendship, she had never been more sensible of mr. knightley’s high superiority of character. the happiness of this most happy day, received its completion, in the animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced.

no objection was raised on the father’s side; the young man was treated liberally; it was all as it should be: and as emma became acquainted with robert martin, who was now introduced at hartfield, she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend. she had no doubt of harriet’s happiness with any good-tempere

jane fairfax had already quitted highbury, and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the campbells.—the mr. churchills were also in town; and they were only waiting for november.
the intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared, by emma and mr. knightley.—they had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while john and isabella were still at hartfield, to allow them the fortnight’s absence in a tour to the seaside, which was the plan.—john and isabella, and every other friend, were agreed in approving it. but mr. woodhouse—how was mr. woodhouse to be induced to consent?—h
