ncho panza? who was don abbondio? yet they live eternally because -- live germs as they were -- they had the fortune to find a fecundating matrix, a fantasy which could raise and nourish them: make them live for ever!

the manager. that is quite all right. but what do you want here, all of you?

the father. we want to live.

the manager [ironically]. for eternity?

the father. no, sir, only for a moment . . . in you.

an actor. just listen to him!

leading lady. they want to live, in us . . ..

juvenile lead [pointing to the step-daughter]. i've no objection, as far as that one is concerned!

the father. look here! look here! the comedy has to be made. [to the manager.] but if you and your actors are willing, we can soon concert it among ourselves.

the manager [annoyed]. but what do you want to concert? we don't go in for concerts here. here we play dramas and comedies!

the father. exactly! that is just why we have come to you.

the manager. and where is the "book"?

the father. it is in us! [the

the mother. leave the poor boy alone. why do you want to make me appear ungrateful, daughter? i don't want to offend your father. i have answered him that i didn't abandon my house and my son through any fault of mine, nor from any wilful passion.

the father. it is true. it was my doing.

leading man [to the company]. what a spectacle!

leading lady. we are the audience this time.

juvenile lead. for once, in a way.

the manager [beginning to get really interested]. let's hear them out. listen!

the son. oh yes, you're going to hear a fine bit now. he will talk to you of the demon of experiment.

the father. you are a cynical imbecile. i've told you so already a hundred times. [to the manager.] he tries to make fun of me on account of this expression which i have found to excuse myself with.

the son [with disgust]. yes, phrases! phrases!

the father. phrases! isn't everyone consoled w

the step-daughter. yes, but ask him how his intelligence has helped us.

the father. if we could see all the evil that may spring from good, what should we do? [at this point the leading lady who is biting her lips with rage at seeing the leading man flirting with the step-daughter, comes forward and says to the manager.]

leading lady. excuse me, but are we going to rehearse today?

manager. of course, of course; but let's hear them out.

juvenile lead. this is something quite new.

l'ingénue. most interesting!

leading lady. yes, for the people who like that kind of thing. [casts a glance at leading man.]

the manager [to father]. you must please explain yourself quite clearly. [sits down.]

the father. very well then: listen! i had in my service a poor man, a clerk, a secretary of mine, full of devotion, who became friends with her. [indicating the mother.] they understood one another, were kindred souls in fact, without, however, the leas

the father. there's no doubt about it. they [indicating the characters.] had better come with us too, hadn't they?

the manager. yes, yes. come on! come on! [moves away and then turning to the actors.] be punctual, please! [manager and the six characters cross the stage and go off. the other actors remain, looking at one another in astonishment.]

leading man. is he serious? what the devil does be want to do?

juvenile lead. this is rank madness.

third actor. does he expect to knock up a drama in five minutes?

juvenile lead. like the improvisers!

leading lady. if he thinks i'm going to take part in a joke like this . . .

juvenile lead. i'm out of it anyway.

fourth actor. i should like to know who they are.. [alludes to characters].

third actor. what do you suppose? madmen or rascals!

juvenile lead. and he takes them seriously!

l'ingénue. vanity! he fancies himself as an author now.

second lady lead.] i see this woman here [means the mother.] as amalia. but do as you like. [gets more and more confused.] i don't know what to say to you. already, i begin to hear my own words ring false, as if they had another sound . . .

the manager. don't you worry about it. it'll be our job to find the right tones. and as for her name, if you want her amalia, amalia it shall be; and if you don't like it, we'll find another! for the moment though, we'll call the characters in this way: [to juvenile lead.] you are the son. [to the leading lady.] you naturally are the step-daughter . . .

the step-daughter [excitedly]. what? what? i, that woman there? [bursts out laughing.]

the manager [angry]. what is there to laugh at?

leading lady.[indignant]. nobody has ever dared to laugh at me. i insist on being treated with respect; otherwise i go away.

the step-daughter. no, no, excuse me . . . i am not laughing at you . . .

the step-daughter [turning towards her]. there she is! there she is!

the father [radiant]. it's she! i said so, didn't i? there she is!

the manager [conquering his surprise, and then becoming indignant]. what sort of a trick is this?

leading man [almost at the same time]. what's going to happen next?

juvenile lead. where does she come from?

l'ingénue. they've been holding her in reserve, i guess.

leading lady. a vulgar trick!

the father [dominating the protests]. excuse me, all of you! why are you so anxious to destroy in the name of a vulgar, commonplace sense of truth, this reality which comes to birth attracted and formed by the magic of the stage itself, which has indeed more right to live here than you, since it is much truer than you -- if you don't mind my saying so? which is the actress among

the actors and the reply of the father. it has begun quietly, naturally, in a manner impossible for the stage. so when the actors, called to attention by the father, turn round and see madame pace, who has placed one hand under the step-daughter's chin to raise her head, they observe her at first with great attention, but hearing her speak in an unintelligible manner their interest begins to wane.]

the manager. well? well?

leading man. what does she say?

leading lady. one can't hear a word.

juvenile lead. louder! louder please!

the step-daughter [leaving madame pace, who smiles a sphinx-like smile, and advancing towards the actors]. louder? louder? what are you talking about? these aren't matters which can be shouted at the top of one's voice. if i have spoken them out loud, it was to shame him and have my revenge.

the son [suddenly]. no! no! if i can't go away, then i'll stop here; but i repeat: i act nothing!

the father [to manager excitedly]. you can force him, sir.

the son. nobody can force me.

the father. i can.

the step-daughter. wait a minute, wait . . . first of all, the baby has to go to the fountain . . . [runs to take the child and leads her to the fountain.]

the manager. yes, yes of course; that's it. both at the same time.

[the second lady lead and the juvenile lead at this point separate themselves from the group of actors. one watches the mother attentively; the other moves about studying the movements and manner of the son whom he will have to act.]

the son [to manager]. what do you mean by both at the same time? it isn't right. there was no scene between me and her. [indicates the mother.] ask her how it was!

the mother. yes, it's true. i had come into his room . . .

the son. into my room, do you understand? nothing to do with the garden.

the manager. exactly! and it seems to me that you ought to be grateful to them for their interest.

the son. yes, but haven't you yet perceived that it isn't possible to live in front of a mirror which not only freezes us with the image of ourselves, but throws our likeness back at us with a horrible grimace?

the mother. yes, into his room, because i couldn't stand it any longer. i went to empty my heart to him of all the anguish that tortures me . . . but as soon as he saw me come in . . .
