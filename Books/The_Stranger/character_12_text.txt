rette before getting off my bed. i was a bit late and
had to run for the streetcar. the office was stifling, and i was kept hard at it all the
afternoon. so it came as a relief when we closed down and i was strolling slowly
along the wharves in the coolness. the sky was green, and it was pleasant to be out-
of-doors after the stuffy office. however, i went straight home, as i had to put some
potatoes on to boil.

the hall was dark and, when i was starting up the stairs, i almost bumped into old
salamano, who lived on the same floor as i. as usual, he had his dog with him. for
eight  years  the  two  had  been  inseparable.  salamanoâ€™s  spaniel  is  an  ugly  brute,

afflicted with some skin diseaseâ€”mange, i suspect; anyhow, it has lost all its hair
and its body is covered with brown scabs. perhaps through living in one small room,
cooped up with his dog, salamano has come to resemble it. his towy hair has gone
very  thin,  and  he  has  reddish

with hatred in his eyes. every time theyâ€™re out, this happens. when the dog wants to
stop at a lamppost, the old boy wonâ€™t let him, and drags him on, and the wretched
spaniel  leaves  behind  him  a  trail  of  little  drops.  but,  if  he  does  it  in  the  room,  it
means another hiding.

itâ€™s been going on like this for eight years, and cÃ©leste always says itâ€™s a â€œcrying
shame,â€ and something should be done about it; but really one canâ€™t be sure. when i
met him in the hall, salamano was bawling at his dog, calling him a bastard, a lousy
mongrel, and so forth, and the dog was whining. i said, â€œgood evening,â€ but the old
fellow took no notice and went on cursing. so i thought iâ€™d ask him what the dog had
done. again, he didnâ€™t answer, but went on shouting, â€œyou bloody cur!â€ and the rest
of it. i couldnâ€™t see very clearly, but he seemed to be fixing something on the dogâ€™s
collar.  i  raised  my  voice  a  little.  without  looking  round,  he  mumbled  in  a

warehouseman. one thingâ€™s sure: he isnâ€™t popular in our street. still, he often has a
word for me, and drops in sometimes for a short talk in my room, because i listen to
him.  as  a  matter  of  fact,  i  find  what  he  says  quite  interesting.  so,  really  iâ€™ve  no
reason  for  freezing  him  off.  his  name  is  sintÃ¨s;  raymond  sintÃ¨s.  heâ€™s  short  and
thick-set, has a nose like a boxerâ€™s, and always dresses very sprucely. he, too, once
said to me, referring to salamano, that it was â€œa damned shame,â€ and asked me if i
wasnâ€™t disgusted by the way the old man served his dog. i answered: â€œno.â€

we went up the stairs together, sintÃ¨s and i, and when i was turning in at my door,

he said:

â€œlook  here!  how  about  having  some  grub  with  me?  iâ€™ve  a  black  pudding  and

r. i appreciated that, and told him so.

when  i  rose,  raymond  shook  hands  very  warmly,  remarking  that  men  always
understood  each  other.  after  closing  the  door  behind  me  i  lingered  for  some
moments on the landing. the whole building was as quiet as the grave, a dank, dark
smell  rising  from  the  well  hole  of  the  stairs.  i  could  hear  nothing  but  the  blood
throbbing in my ears, and for a while i stood still, listening to it. then the dog began
to  moan  in  old  salamanoâ€™s  room,  and  through  the  sleep-bound  house  the  little
plaintive  sound  rose  slowly,  like  a  flower  growing  out  of  the  silence  and  the
darkness.

i had a busy time in the office throughout the week. raymond dropped in once to
tell  me  heâ€™d  sent  off  the  letter.  i  went  to  the  pictures  twice  with  emmanuel,  who
doesnâ€™t always understand whatâ€™s happening on the screen and asks me to explain it.

te a while. i pressed her to
my side as we scrambled up the foreshore. both of us were in a hurry to catch the
bus, get back to my place, and tumble on to the bed. iâ€™d left my window open, and it
was pleasant to feel the cool night air flowing over our sunburned bodies.

marie  said  she  was  free  next  morning,  so  i  proposed  she  should  have  luncheon
with me. she agreed, and i went down to buy some meat. on my way back i heard a
womanâ€™s voice in raymondâ€™s room. a little later old salamano started grumbling at
his  dog  and  presently  there  was  a  sound  of  boots  and  paws  on  the  wooden  stairs;
then, â€œfilthy brute! get on, you cur!â€ and the two of them went out into the street. i
told marie about the old manâ€™s habits, and it made her laugh. she was wearing one of
my  pajama  suits,  and  had  the  sleeves  rolled  up.  when  she  laughed  i  wanted  her
again. a moment later she asked me if i loved her. i said that sort of question had no
meaning, really; but i sup

we went out together, and raymond stood me a brandy in a cafÃ©. then we had a
game of billiards; it was a close game and i lost by only a few points. after that he
proposed going to a brothel, but i refused; i didnâ€™t feel like it. as we were walking
slowly  back  he  told  me  how  pleased  he  was  at  having  paid  out  his  mistress  so
satisfactorily.  he  made  himself  extremely  amiable  to  me,  and  i  quite  enjoyed  our
walk.

when we were nearly home i saw old salamano on the doorstep; he seemed very
excited.  i  noticed  that  his  dog  wasnâ€™t  with  him.  he  was  turning  like  a  teetotum,
looking in all directions, and sometimes peering into the darkness of the hall with his
little bloodshot eyes. then heâ€™d mutter something to himself and start gazing up and
down the street again.

raymond asked him what was wrong, but he didnâ€™t answer at once. then i heard
him grunt, â€œthe bastard! the filthy cur!â€ when i asked him where his dog was, he

â€œis it likely iâ€™d give money for a mutt like that? no damned fear! they can kill

him, for all i care.â€ and he went on calling his dog the usual names.

raymond gave a laugh and turned into the hall. i followed him upstairs, and we
parted  on  the  landing.  a  minute  or  two  later  i  heard  salamanoâ€™s  footsteps  and  a
knock on my door.

when i opened it, he halted for a moment in the doorway.
â€œexcuse me ... i hope iâ€™m not disturbing you.â€
i  asked  him  in,  but  he  shook  his  head.  he  was  staring  at  his  toe  caps,  and  the

gnarled old hands were trembling. without meeting my eyes, he started talking.

â€œthey wonâ€™t really take him from me, will they, monsieur meursault? surely they

wouldnâ€™t do a thing like that. if they doâ€”i donâ€™t know what will become of me.â

ng nothing better to do, i followed her for a short distance. keeping on the
curb of the pavement, she walked straight  ahead,  never  swerving  or  looking  back,
and it was extraordinary how fast she covered the ground, considering her smallness.
in fact, the pace was too much for me, and i soon lost sight of her and turned back
homeward. for a moment the â€œlittle robotâ€ (as i thought of her) had much impressed
me, but i soon forgot about her.

as i was turning in at my door i ran into old salamano. i asked him into my room,
and  he  informed  me  that  his  dog  was  definitely  lost.  heâ€™d  been  to  the  pound  to
inquire,  but  it  wasnâ€™t  there,  and  the  staff  told  him  it  had  probably  been  run  over.
when he asked them whether it was any use inquiring about it at the police station,
they said the police had more important things to attend to than keeping records of
stray  dogs  run  over  in  the  streets.  i  suggested  he  should  get  another  dog,  but,

ough, he pointed out that heâ€™d become used to this one, and it wouldnâ€™t
be the same thing.

i  was  seated  on  my  bed,  with  my  legs  up,  and  salamano  on  a  chair  beside  the
table, facing me, his hands spread on his knees. he had kept on his battered felt hat
and was mumbling away behind his draggled yellowish mustache. i found him rather
boring, but i had nothing to do and didnâ€™t feel sleepy. so, to keep the conversation
going, i asked some questions about his dogâ€”how long he had had it and so forth.
he told me he had got it soon after his wifeâ€™s death. heâ€™d married rather late in life.

lway, and he didnâ€™t regret it, as now he
had a small pension. he and his wife had never hit it off very well, but theyâ€™d got
used to each other, and when she died he felt lonely. one of his mates on the railway
whose  bitch  had  just  had  pups  had  offered  him  one,  and  he  had  taken  it,  as  a
companion. heâ€™d had to feed it from the bottle at first. but, as a dogâ€™s life is shorter
than a manâ€™s, theyâ€™d grown old together, so to speak.

â€œhe  was  a  cantankerous  brute,â€  salamano  said.  â€œnow  and  then  we  had  some

proper set-tos, he and i. but he was a good mutt all the same.â€

i said he looked well bred, and that evidently pleased the old man.
â€œah,  but  you  should  have  seen  him  before  his  illness!â€  he  said.  â€œhe  had  a
wonderful coat; in fact, that was his best point, really. i tried hard to cure him; every

ds  swung  round
together toward the bench), the hurried reading of the charge sheet, in the course of
which  i  recognized  some  familiar  names  of  people  and  places;  then  some
supplementary questions put to my lawyer.

next, the judge announced that the court would call over the witness list. some of
the names read out by the clerk rather surprised me. from amongst the crowd, which
until  now  i  had  seen  as  a  mere  blur  of  faces,  rose,  one  after  the  other,  raymond,
masson, salamano, the doorkeeper from the home, old pÃ©rez, and marie, who gave
me a little nervous wave of her hand before following the others out by a side door. i
was thinking how strange it was i hadnâ€™t noticed any of them before when i heard the
last name called, that of cÃ©leste. as he rose, i noticed beside him the quaint little
woman with a mannish coat and brisk, decided air, who had shared my table at the
restaurant.  she  had  her  eyes  fixed  on  me,  i  noticed.  but  i  hadnâ€™t  time  to  won

, she said; it wasnâ€™t a bit like that really, heâ€™d
bullied her into saying the opposite of what she meant. she knew me very well, and
she was sure i hadnâ€™t done anything really wrongâ€”and so on. at a sign from the
presiding judge, one of the court officers led her away, and the hearing continued.

hardly anyone seemed to listen to masson, the next witness. he stated that i was a
respectable young fellow; â€œand, whatâ€™s more, a very decent chap.â€ nor did they pay
any more attention to salamano, when he told them how kind iâ€™d always been to his
dog,  or  when,  in  answer  to  a  question  about  my  mother  and  myself,  he  said  that
mother and i had very little in common and that explained why iâ€™d fixed up for her
to  enter  the  home.  â€œyouâ€™ve  got  to  understand,â€  he  added.  â€œyouâ€™ve  got  to
understand.â€ but no one seemed to understand. he was told to stand down.

raymond was the next, and last, witness. he gave me a little wave of his hand and

leged  people  who,  like  him,  called  themselves  my  brothers.  surely,  surely  he
must see that? every man alive was privileged; there was only one class of men, the
privileged class. all alike would be condemned to die one day; his turn, too, would
come like the othersâ€™. and what difference could it make if, after being charged with
murder, he were executed because he didnâ€™t weep at his motherâ€™s funeral, since it all
came  to  the  same  thing  in  the  end?  the  same  thing  for  salamanoâ€™s  wife  and  for
salamanoâ€™s dog. that little robot woman was as â€œguiltyâ€ as the girl from paris who
had married masson, or as marie, who wanted me to marry her. what did it matter if
raymond was as much my pal as cÃ©leste, who was a far worthier man? what did it
matter if at this very moment marie was kissing a new boy friend? as a condemned
man  himself,  couldnâ€™t  he  grasp  what  i  meant by that dark wind blowing from  my
future? ...
