tributes were practically glued to their chariots, 
the scene is very social. the victors, both this year's 
tributes and their mentors, are standing around in 
small groups, talking. of course, they all know one 
another and i don't know anyone, and i'm not really 
the sort of person to go around introducing myself. so 
i just stroke the neck of one of my horses and try not 
to be noticed. it doesn't work. 

the crunching hits my ear before i even know he's 
beside me, and when i turn my head, finnick odair's 
famous sea green eyes are only inches from mine. he 
pops a sugar cube in his mouth and leans against my 
horse. 

"hello, katniss," he says, as if we've known each other 
for years, when in fact we've never met.

"hello, finnick," i say, just as casually, although i'm 
feeling uncomfortable at his closeness, especially 
since he's got so much bare skin exposed. 

"want a sugar cube?" he says, offering his hand, 
which is piled high. "

whereas you and i... well, if we see something sweet, 
we better grab it quick." 

finnick odair is something of a living legend in 
panem. since he won the sixty-fifth hunger games 
when he was only fourteen, he's still one of the 
youngest victors. being from district 4, he was a 
career, so the odds were already in his favor, but 
what no trainer could claim to have given him was his 
extraordinary beauty. tall, athletic, with golden skin 
and bronze-colored hair and those incredible eyes. 
while other tributes that year were hard-pressed to 
get a handful of grain or some matches for a

r some stupid reason, i blush, but i force myself to 
hold my ground. "no, i'm an open book," i whisper 
back. "everybody seems to know my secrets before i 
know them myself." 

he smiles. "unfortunately, i think that's true." his 
eyes flicker off to the side. "peeta is coming. sorry you 
have to cancel your wedding. i know how devastating 
that must be for you." he tosses another sugar cube 
in his mouth and saunters off. 

peeta's beside me, dressed in an outfit identical to 
mine. "what did finnick odair want?" he asks. 

i turn and put my lips close to peeta's and drop my 
eyelids in imitation of finnick. "he offered me sugar 
and wanted to know all my secrets," i say in my best 
seductive voice. 

peeta laughs. "ugh. not really." 

"really," i say. "i'll tell you more when my skin stops 
crawling."

"do you think we'd have ended up like this if only one 
of us had won?" he asks, glancing around at the other 
victors. "just another part

"no. it's not — " i get out, but i'm cut off by an even 
more hysterical round of sobbing that seems only to 
confirm what finnick said about the baby. he meets 
my eyes and i glare at him through my tears. it's 
stupid, i know, that his efforts make me so vexed. all 
i wanted was to keep peeta alive, and i couldn't and 
finnick could, and i should be nothing but grateful. 
and i am. but i am also furious because it means 
that i will never stop owing finnick odair. ever. so 
how can i kill him in his sleep? 

i expect to see a smug or sarcastic expression on his 
face, but his look is strangely quizzical. he glances 
between peeta and me, as if trying to figure something 
out, then gives his head a slight shake as if to clear it. 
"how are you?" he asks peeta. "do you think you can 
move on?" 

"no, he has to rest," i say. my nose is running like 
crazy and i don't even have a shred of fabric to use as 
a handkerchief. mags rips off a handful of hanging

in a soft, singsong voice. 

his eyelids flutter open and then he jumps like we've 
stabbed him. "aa!"

finnick and i fall back in the sand, laughing our 
heads off. every time we try to stop, we look at peeta's 
attempt to maintain a disdainful expression and it 
sets us off again. by the time we pull ourselves 
together, i'm thinking that maybe finnick odair is all 
right. at least not as vain or self-important as i'd 
thought. not so bad at all, really. and just as i've 
come to this conclusion, a parachute lands next to us 
with a fresh loaf of bread. remembering from last 
year how haymitch's gifts are often timed to send a 
message, i make a note to myself. be friends with 
finnick. you'll get food. 

finnick turns the bread over in his hands, examining 
the crust. a bit too possessively. it's not necessary. 
it's got that green tint from seawe

always. they reinsert their tubes and talk to me in 
soothing voices that never reach me. all i can think of 
is peeta, lying on a similar table somewhere, while 
they try to break him for information he doesn't even 
have. 

"katniss. katniss, i'm sorry." finnick's voice comes 
from the bed next to me and slips into my 
consciousness. perhaps because we're in the same 
kind of pain. "i wanted to go back for him and 
johanna, but i couldn't move." 

i don't answer. finnick odair's good intentions mean 
less than nothing. 

"it's better for him than johanna. they'll figure out he 
doesn't know anything pretty fast. and they won't kill 
him if they think they can use him against you," says 
finnick. 

"like bait?" i say to the ceiling. "like how theyll use 
annie for bait, finnick?" 

i can hear him weeping but i don't care. they 
probably won't even bother to question her, she's so 
far gone. gone right off the deep end years ago in her 
games. there's a good chance i'm
