Madame Marie Arnoux - 
The woman Frederic pursues unsuccessfully for years.
Madame Arnoux represents a domestic, maternal figure for Frederic,
satisfying his needs for safety and comfort. Although she finally returns
Frederic's feelings, she remains virtuous; Frederic rejects her
sole attempt to become his lover. She represents his inability to
desire anything that he can actually have; when he gets her, he
no longer wants her.
