[CHARACTER] - 
      barabas's daughter. [CHARACTER] is initially dutiful to her father and unwittingly helps him mislead mathias and lodowick. however, when she discovers her father's involvement in their deaths, [CHARACTER] decides to convert to christianity to atone for her sins. her conversion could be read as a moral climax within the play, for it suggests that the true path to salvation lies in christian redemption. however, [CHARACTER]'s rejection of her heritage in favor of joining a hypocritical christian clergy is in many respects unconvincing. marlowe probably intended this action to be deeply ironic, and as such it reinforces the play's essential ambiguity.
