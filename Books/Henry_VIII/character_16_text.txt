
(and generally) who euer the king fauours,
the cardnall instantly will finde imployment,
and farre enough from court too

   2. all the commons
hate him perniciously, and o' my conscience
wish him ten faddom deepe: this duke as much
they loue and doate on: call him bounteous buckingham,
the mirror of all courtesie.
enter buckingham from his arraignment, tipstaues before him,
the axe with
the edge towards him, halberds on each side, accompanied with
sir thomas
louell, sir nicholas vaux, sir walter sands, and common people,
&c.

  1. stay there sir,
and see the noble ruin'd man you speake of

   2. let's stand close and behold him

   buck. all good people,
you that thus farre haue come to pitty me;
heare what i say, and then goe home and lose me.
i haue this day receiu'd a traitors iudgement,
and by that name must dye; yet heauen beare witnes,
and if i haue a conscience, let it sincke me,
euen as the axe falls, if i be not faithfull.
the law i beare no mallice

e my graue.
commend mee to his grace:
and if he speake of buckingham; pray tell him,
you met him halfe in heauen: my vowes and prayers
yet are the kings; and till my soule forsake,
shall cry for blessings on him. may he liue
longer then i haue time to tell his yeares;
euer belou'd and louing, may his rule be;
and when old time shall lead him to his end,
goodnesse and he, fill vp one monument

   lou. to th' water side i must conduct your grace;
then giue my charge vp to sir nicholas vaux,
who vndertakes you to your end

   vaux. prepare there,
the duke is comming: see the barge be ready;
and fit it with such furniture as suites
the greatnesse of his person

   buck. nay, sir nicholas,
let it alone; my state now will but mocke me.
when i came hither, i was lord high constable,
and duke of buckingham: now, poore edward bohun;
yet i am richer then my base accusers,
that neuer knew what truth meant: i now seale it;
and with that bloud will make 'em one day groane for'
