'balloon,' said will. 'a montgolfier is a balloon.'
mademoiselle tarot!' read jim. 'the dangling man. the demon guillotine! the
illustrated man! hey!'
'that's just an old guy with tattoos.'
'no.' jim breathed warm on the paper. 'he's illustrated.special.see! covered with monsters!
a menagerie!' jim's eyes jumped. 'see! the skeleton! ain't that fine, will? not thin man, no,
but skeleton! see! the dust witch! what's a dust witch, will?'
'no.' jim squinted off, seeing things. 'a gypsy that was born in the dust,raised in the dust,
and some day winds up back in the dust. here's more:egyptian mirror maze! see
yourself ten thousand times! saint anthony's temple of temptation!'
‘the most beautiful - ' read will.
' - woman in the world,' finished jim.
they looked at each other.
'can a carnival have the most beautiful woman on earth in its side-show, will?'
'you ever seen carnival ladies, jim?'
'grizzly

d and fifty, two hundred years old, and dying
of it!'
'jim' said will.
the four men stirred uneasily.
'they must've taken him in a tent.' will started off.a policeman took his elbow.
'did you say one hundred and fifty years old?' he asked jim. 'why not three hundred?'
'maybe he was! oh god.' jim turned, yelling. 'mr cooger! we brought help!'
lights blinked on in the freak tent. the huge banners out front rumbled and lashed as arc
lights flushed over them. the police glanced up. mr skeleton, the dust witch, the
crusher,vesuvio the lava sippfr! danced soft, big, painted each on its separate flag.
jim paused by the rustling freak show entry.
'mr cooger?' he pleaded. 'you…there?'
the tent flaps mouthed out a warm lion air.
'what?' asked a policeman.
jim read the moving flaps.
'they said ‘yes.’ they said, ‘come in.’
jim stepped through. the others followed.
inside they squinted through crisscrossed tent pole shadows to the high freak platforms and
all the world-wandered aliens, crippled of

ps and threaded teeth.
the illustrated man cut the power to a whine. then, turning, he fell to his knees, and put out
his hand.
away off up there on the platform, there was the faintest stir as of an autumn leaf beneath
the old man's shirt.
the freaks exhaled.
the old old man sighed.
yes, will thought, they're breathing for him, helping him, making him to live.
inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale - yet it looked like an act. what could he say, or do?
'…lungs so…so…so…' someone whispered.
the dust witch, back in her glass box?
inhale. the freaks breathed.exhale. their shoulders slumped.
the old old man's lips trembled.
'…heart beat…one…two…so…so…'
the witch again? will feared to look.
a vein ticked a small watch in the old man's throat.
very slowly now that right eye of the old man opened full wide, fixed, stared like a broken
camera. it was like looking through a hole in space, with no bottom forever. he grew warmer.
the boys, below, grew colder.
now the old and terribly-wise-with

storm-bleached balloon whisper-purled, plummet-sank softly down, its
elephant shadow cooling gemmed lawns and sundials as they flaunted their swift gaze high
through that shadow.
and what they saw was something akimbo and arustle in the down-hung wicker carriage.

sipper! the hanging man! monsieur guillotine!
no.
the dust witch.
the witch who might draw skulls and bones in the dust, then sneeze it away.
jim looked to will and will to jim; both read their lips: the witch!
but why a wax crone flung out in a night balloon to search? thought will, why none of the
others, with their lizard-venom, wolf-fire, snake-pit eyes? why send a crumbled statue with
blind-newt lashes sewn tight with black-widow thread?
and then, looking up, they knew.
for the witch, though peculiar wax, was peculiarly alive.blind, yes, but she thrust

 would it come back? would she mark the
roof again, and they have to wash it off, and she mark it and they wash it, until dawn? yes, if
need be.
if only, thought will, i could stop the witch for good. they don't know our names or where we
live, mr cooger's too near dead to remember or tell. the dwarf - if he is the lightning-rod man -
is mad - and, god willing, won't recollect! and they won't dare bother miss foley until morning.
so, grinding their teeth way out in the meadows, they've sent the dust witch to search…
'i'm a fool,' grieved jim, quietly,rinsing the roof where the lightning-rod had been. 'why didn't i
leave it up?'
'lightning hasn't struck yet,' will said. 'and if we jump lively, it won't. now - over here!'
they showered the roof.
below, someone put down a window.
'mom.' jim laughed, bleakly. 'she thinks it's raining.'

the rain ceased.
the roof was clean.
they let the hose snake away to thump on the night grass a thousand miles below.
beyond town, the balloon still paused betwe
