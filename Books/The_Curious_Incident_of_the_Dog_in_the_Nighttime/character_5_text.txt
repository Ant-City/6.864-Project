black fur, but when you got close you could see that the skin underneath the fur was a very pale yellow,

my name is christopher john francis boone. i know all the countries of the world and their capital cities 
and every prime number up to 7,057. 
 
eight years ago, when i first met siobhan, she showed me this picture  
 

 
 
and i knew that it meant "sad," which is what i felt when i found the dead dog.  
 
then she showed me this picture  

 

 
 
and i knew that it meant "happy," like when i'm reading about the apollo space missions, or when i am 
still awake at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. in the morning and i can walk up and down the street and pretend that i am 
the only person in the whole world.  
 

 

then she drew some other pictures

i  got  siobhan  to  draw  lots  of  these  faces  and  then  write  down  next  to  them  exactly what  they meant.  i 
kept the piece of paper in my pocket and took it out when i didn't understand what someone was saying. 
but  it  was  very  difficult  to  decide  which  of  the  diagrams  was  most  like  the  face  they  were  making 
because people's faces move very quickly. 
 
when  i  told  siobhan  that  i  was  doing  this,  she  got  out  a  pencil  and  another  piece  of  paper  and  said  it 
probably made people feel very

how much blood there was and didn't want to get dirty. instead she started screaming again. 
 
i  put  my  hands  over  my  ears  and  closed  my  eyes  and  rolled  forward  till  i  was  hunched  up  with  my

this is a murder mystery novel. 
 
siobhan  said  that  i  should  write  something  i  would  want  to  read  myself.  mostly  i  read  books  about 
science and maths. i do not like proper novels. in proper novels people say things like, "i am veined with 
iron, with silver and with streaks of common mud. i cannot contract into the firm fist which those clench 
who  do  not  depend  on  stimulus."  1  what  does  this  mean?  i  do  not  know.  nor  does  father.  nor  does 
siobhan or mr. jeavons. i have asked them. 
 
siobhan has lo

ng blond hair and wears glasses which are made of green plastic. and mr. jeavons smells 
of soap and wears brown shoes that have approximately 60 tiny circular holes in each of them. 
 
but i do like murder mystery novels. so i am writing a murder mystery novel. 
 
in  a  murder  mystery  novel  someone  has  to  work  out  who  the  murderer  is  and  then  catch  them.  it  is  a 
puzzle. if it is a good puzzle you can sometimes work out the answer before the end of the book. 
 
siobhan said that the book should begin with something to grab people's attention. that is why i started 
with the dog. i also started with the dog because it happened to me and i find it hard to imagine things 
which did not happen to me. 
 
siobhan  read  the  first  page  and  said  that  it  was  different.  she  put  this  word  into  inverted  commas  by 
making  the  wiggly  quotation  sign  with  her  first  and  second  fingers.  she  said  that  it  was  usually  people 
who  were  killed  in

  murder  mystery  novels.  i  said  that  two  dogs  were  killed  in  the  hound  of  the 
baskervilles, the hound itself and james mortimer's spaniel, but siobhan said they weren't the victims of 
the murder, sir charles baskerville was. she said that this was because readers cared more about people 
than dogs, so if a person was killed in a book, readers would want to carry on reading. 
 
i said that i wanted to write about something real and i knew people who had died but i did not know any 
people  who  had  been  killed,  except  mr.  paulson,  edward's  father  from  school,  and  that  was  a  gliding 
accident, not murder, and i didn't really know

 him. i also said that i cared about dogs because they were 
faithful  and  honest,  and  some  dogs  were  cleverer  and  more  interesting  than  some  people.  steve,  for 
example, who comes to the school on thursdays, needs help to eat his food and could not even fetch a 
stick. siobhan asked me not to say this to steve's mother.

then the police arrived. i like the police. they have uniforms and numbers and you know what they are 
meant to be doing. there was a policewoman and a policeman. the policewoman had a little hole in her 
tights on her left ankle and a red scratch in the middle of the hole. the policeman had a big orange leaf 
stuck to the bottom of his shoe which was poking out from one side. 
 
the policewoman put her arms rou

i wondered whether mrs. shears had told the police that i had killed wellington and whether, when the 
police  found  out  that  she  had  lied,  she  would  go  to  prison.  because  telling  lies  about  people  is  called 
slander.

i find people confusing. 
 
this is for two main reasons. 
 
the first main reason is that people do a lot of talking without using any words. siobhan says that if you 
raise one eyebrow it can mean lots of different things. it can mean "i want to do sex with you" and it can 
also mean "i think that what you just said was very stupid." 
 
siobhan also says that if you close your mouth and breathe out loudly through your nose, it can mean that 
you are relaxed, or that you are bored, or that you are angry, and it all depends on how much air comes 
out of your nose and how fast and what shape your mouth is when you do it and how you are sitting

cs and i'm very 
good at them. but terry won't go to university. father says terry is most likely to end up in prison. 
 
terry has a tattoo on his arm of a heart shape with a knife through the middle of it. 
 
but this is what is called a digression, and now i am going to go back to the fact that it was a good day. 
 
because it was a good day i decided that i would try and find out who killed wellington because a good 
day is a day for projects and planning things. 
 
when  i  said  this  to  siobhan  she  said,  "well, we're  meant  to  be  writing  stories  today,  so  why  don't  you 
write about finding wellington and going to the police station." 
 
and that is when i started writing this. 
 
and siobhan said that she would help with the spelling and the grammar and the footnotes.

wars and the gulf war and there were christians killing people in all of them. 
 
also i don't know what father means when he says "stay out of other people's business" because i do not 
know what he means by "other people's business" because i do lots of things with other people, at school 
and in the shop and on the bus, and his job is going into other people's houses and fixing their boilers and 
their heating. and all of these things are other people's business. 
 
siobhan understands. when she tells me not to do something she tells me exactly what it is that i am not 
allowed to do. and i like this. 
 
for example, she once said, "you must never punch sarah or hit her in any way, christopher. even if she 
hits you first. if she does hit you again, move away from her and stand still and count from 1 to 50, then 
come and tell me what she has done, or tell one of the other members of staff what she has done." 
 
or,  for  example,  she  once  said,  "if  you  want

is what they are. i'm meant to say that they have learning difficulties or that they have special needs. but 
this  is  stupid  because  everyone  has  learning  difficulties  because  learning  to  speak  french  or 
understanding relativity is difficult and also everyone has special needs, like father, who has to carry a 
little packet of artificial sweetening tablets around with him to put in his coffee to stop him from getting 
fat, or mrs. peters, who wears a beige-colored hearing aid, or siobhan, who has glasses so thick that they 
give you a headache if you borrow them, and none of these people are special needs, even if they have 
special needs. 
 
but  siobhan  said  we  have  to  use  those  words  because  people  used  to  call  children  like  the  children  at 
school  spaz  and  crip  and  mong,  which  were  nasty  words.  but  that  is  stupid  too  because  sometimes  the 
children from the school down the road see us in the street when we're getting off the bus and they sh

the  next  day  at  school  i  told  siobhan  that  father  had  told  me  i  couldn't  do  any  more  detecting,  which 
meant  that  the  book  was  finished.  i  showed  her  the  pages  i  had  written  so  far,  with  the  diagram  of  the 
universe and the map of the street and the prime numbers. and she said that it didn't matter. she said the 
book was really good as it was and that i should be very proud of having written a book at all, even if it 
was  quite  short  and  there  were  some  very  good  books  which  were  very  s

and she said, "perhaps your father just doesn't like mr. shears very much." 
 
and i asked, "why?" 
 
and she said, "i don't know, christopher. i don't know because i don't know anything about mr. shears." 
 
i said, "mr. shears used to be married to mrs. shears and he left her, like in a divorce. but i don't know if 
they were actually divorced." 
 
and siobhan said, "well, mrs. shears is a friend of yours, isn't she. a friend of you and your father. so 
perhaps your father doesn't like mr. shears because he left mrs. shears. because he did something bad to 
someone who is a friend." 
 
and i said, "but father says mrs. shears isn't a friend of ours anymore." 
 
and siobhan said, "i'm sorry, christopher. i wish i could answer all these questions, but i simply don't 
know." 
 
then the bell went for the end of school.

and father said, "what's the point? they're hardly going to take him to court, are they?" 
 
and rhodri said, "that'll be the day." 
 
and father said, "best to let sleeping dogs lie, i reckon." 
 
then i went into the garden. 
 
siobhan said that when you are writing a book you have to include some descriptions of things. i said that 
i could take photographs and put them in the book. but she said the idea of a book was to describe things 
using words so that people could read them and make a picture in their own head. 
 
and she said it was best to describe things that were interesting or different. 
 
she also said that i should describe people in the story by mentioning one or two details about them so 
that people could ma

that  night  i  wrote  some  more  of  my  book,  and  the  next  morning  i  took  it  into  school  so  that  siobhan 
could read it and tell me if i had made mistakes with the spelling and the grammar. 
 
siobhan  read  the  book  during  morning  break  when  she  has  a  cup  of  coffee  and  sits  at  the  edge  of  the 
playground with the other teachers. and after morning break she came and sat down next to me and said 
she had read the bit about my conversation with mrs. alexander and she said, "have you told your father 
about this?" 
 
and i replied, "no." 
 
and she said, "are you going to tell your

town  on  the  hill  in  the  distance  and  we'd  sit  outside  in  the  evening  and  drink  red  wine  and  smoke 
gauloises cigarettes and watch the sun go down." 
 
and  siobhan  once  said  that  when  she  felt  depressed  or  sad  she  would  close  her  eyes  and  she  would 
imagine that she was staying in a house on cape cod with her friend elly, and they would take a trip on a 
boat from provincetown and go out  into  the bay to watch the humpback whales  and that  made  her feel

when i got home from school father was still out at work, so i unlocked the front door and went inside 
and took my coat off. i went into the kitchen and put my things on the table. and one of the things was 
this book which i had taken into school to show to siobhan. i made  myself a raspberry milk shake and 
heated it up in the microwave and then went through to the living room to watch one of my blue planet 
videos about life in the deepest parts of the ocean. 
 
the video was about the sea creatures who live around sulfur chimneys, which are underwater volcanoes 
where  gases  are  ejected  from  the  earth's  crust  into  the  water.  scientists  never  expected  there  to  be  any 
living organisms there because it was so hot and so poisonous, but the

i said, "it's a book i'm writing." 
 
and he said, "is this true? did you talk to mrs. alexander?" he said this very quietly as well, so i still 
didn't realize that he was angry. 
 
and i said, "yes." 
 
then he said, "holy fucking jesus, christopher. how stupid are you?"

meant to answer it because the person who is asking it already knows the answer. it is difficult to spot a 
rhetorical question. 
 
then father said, "what the fuck did i tell you, christopher?" this was much louder. 
 
and  i  replied,  "not  to  mention  mr.  shears's  name  in  our  house.  and  not  to  go  asking  mrs.  shears,  or

mrs. forbes said that hating yellow and brown is just being silly. and siobhan said that she shouldn't say 
things like that and everyone has favorite colors. and siobhan was right. but mrs. forbes was a bit right, 
too. because it is sort of being silly. but in life you have to take lots of decisions and if you don't take

whether father had hit me and i said i didn't know because i got very cross and it made my memory go

tyrone said that there was a horse and a pig in the poo, so i said he was being stupid, but siobhan said he 
wasn't. they were small plastic animals from the library that the staff use to make people tell stories. and 
joseph had eaten them. 
 
so  i  said  i  wasn't  going  to  go  into  the  toilets  because  there  was  poo  on  the  floor  and  it  made  me  feel

and then i had to work out what to do. 
 
and i did this by thinking of all the things i could do and deciding whether they were the right decision or 
not. 
 
i decided that i couldn't go home again. 
 
and i decided that i couldn't go and live with siobhan because she couldn't look after  me when school 
was closed because she was a teacher and not a friend or a member of my family. 
 
and  i  decided  that  i  couldn't  go  and  live  with  uncle  terry  because  he  lived  in  sunderland  and  i  didn't 
know how to get to sunderland and i didn't like uncle terry because he smoked cigarettes and stroked 
my hair.

i  went  out  through  the  garden  gate  and  made  sure  there  wasn't  anyone  watching,  and  then  i  started 
walking  toward  the  school  because  that  was  a  direction  i  knew,  and  when  i  got  to  school  i  could  ask

normally  i  would  have  got  more  and  more  frightened  if  i  was  walking  to  school,  because  i  had  never 
done it before. but i was frightened in two different ways. and one way was being frightened of being far 
away from a place i was used to, and the other was being frightened of being near where father lived, and 
they were in inverse proportion to one another, so that the total fear remained a constant as i got further

knew that if i curled up on the ground and did groaning, then father would come out of the school and he 
would see me and he would catch me and take me home. so i took lots of deep breaths like siobhan says

numbers and did their cubes as i said them. and that made the hurt less painful. 
 
and then i cleaned the sick away from my mouth and i made a decision that i would have to find out how 
to get to the train station and i would do this by asking someone, and it would be a lady because when 
they talked to us about stranger danger at school they say that if a man comes up to you and t

ut a cow, and siobhan said i didn't have to go back 
and change what i wrote in chapter 13 because it doesn't matter because it is not a lie, just a clarification. 
 
and this is the joke. 
 
there  are  three  men  on  a  train.  one  of  them  is  an  economist  and  one  of  them  is  a  logician  and  one  of 
them is a mathematician. and they have just crossed the border into scotland (i don't know why they are 
going to scotland) and they see  a brown cow standing in  a  field from  the window of the  train (a

  my  head  and  someone  bumped  into  me  as  they  walked  past  and  i  made  a  noise  like  a  dog 
barking to scare them off. 
 
and i pictured in my head a big red line across the floor which started at my feet and went through the 
tunnel  and  i  started  walking  along  the  red  line,  saying,  "left,  right,  left,  right,  left,  right,"  because 
sometimes when i am frightened or angry it helps if i do something that has a rhythm to it, like music or 
drumming, which is something siobhan taught me to do. 
 
and i went up the stairs and i saw a sign saying  platform 1 and the  was pointing at a glass door so i 
went through it, and someone bumped into me again with a suitcase and i made another noise like a dog 
barking, and they said, "watch where the hell you're going," but i pretended that they were just one of the 
guarding demons in train to london and there was a train. and i saw a man with a newspaper and a 
bag of golf clubs go up to one of the doors of the train and pre

out of the wall if it crashes, because i wanted to go to sleep so that i wouldn't have to think because the 
only thing i could think was how much it hurt because there was no room for anything else in my head, 
but i couldn't go to sleep and i just had to sit there and there was nothing to do except to wait and to hurt.

and this is another description because siobhan said i should do descriptions and it is a description of the 
advert that was on the wall of the little train station opposite me, but i can't remember all of it because i 
thought i was going to die. and the advert said 

dream holiday,  

think kuoni  
in malaysia 

and behind the writing there was a big photograph of 2 orangutans and they were swinging on branches 
and  there  were  trees  behind  them  but  the  leaves  were  blurred  because  the  camera  was  focusing  on  the 
orangutans

and adverts are pictures or television programs  to  make you buy things like  cars or snickers or use an 
internet service provider. but this was an advert to make you go to malaysia on a holiday. and malaysia 
is in southeast asia and it is made up of peninsular malaysia and sabah and sarawak and labuan and the 
capital  is  kuala  lumpur  and  the  highest  mountain  is  mount  kinabalu,  which  is  4,101  meters  high,  but 
that wasn't on the advert. 
 
and siobhan says people go on holidays to see new things and relax, but it wouldn't make me relaxed and 
you can see new things by looking at earth under a  microscope or drawing the shape of the solid  made 
when 3 circular rods of equal thickness intersect at right angles. and i think that there are so many things 
just  in  one  house  that  it  would  take  years  to  think  about  all  of  them  properly.  and  also,  a  thing  is 
interesting because of thinking about it and not because of being new.

 for example, siobhan showed me 
that you can wet your finger and rub the edge of a thin glass and make a singing noise. and you can put 
different amounts of water in different glasses and they make different notes because they have what are 
called different resonant frequencies, and you can play a tune like three blind mice. and lots of people 
have thin glasses in their houses and they don't know you can do this. 
 
and the advert said 

malaysia, truly asia.

and there were three other pictures, and they were very small, and they were a palace and a beach and a 
palace. and this is what the orangutans looked like

and i kept my eyes closed and i didn't look at my watch at all. and the trains coming in and out of the 
station were in a rhythm, like music or drumming. and it was like counting and saying, "left, right, left, 
right, left, right. . ." which siobhan taught me to do to make myself calm. and i was saying in my head, 
"train coming. train stopped. train going. silence. train coming. train stopped. train going. . ." as if 
the trains were only in my mind. and normally i don't imagine things that aren't happening because it is a 
lie and it makes me feel scared, but it was better than watching the trains coming in and out of the station 
because that made me feel even more scared. 
 
and i didn't open my eyes and i didn't look at my watch. and

and  i  put  toby  into  the  pocket  inside  my  jacket  and  he  went  very  quiet  and  he 
didn't move. 
 
and the man with the diamond patterns on his socks was standing next to me and he said, "what the fuck 
do you think you were playing at?" 
 
but i didn't say anything. 
 
and he said, "what were you doing?" 
 
and the doors of the train opened and people got off and there was a lady standing behind the man with 
the diamond patterns on his socks and she was carrying a guitar case like siobhan has. 
 
and i said, "i was finding toby. he's my pet rat." 
 
and the man with the diamond patterns on his socks said, "fucking nora." 
 
and the lady with the guitar case said, "is he ok?" 
 
and the man with the diamond patterns on his socks said, "him? thanks a fucking bundle. jesus christ. 
a pet rat. oh shit. my train." and then he ran to the train and he banged on the door, which was closed, 
and the train started to go away and he said, "fuck." 
 
and the lady said, "are you ok?" and she

street and there was a bus and a big machine with a sign on it which said english welsh and scottish 
railways, but it was yellow, and i looked around and it was dark and there were lots of bright lights and i 
hadn't been outside for a long time and it made me feel sick. and i kept my eyelids very close together 
and i just looked at the shape of the roads and then i knew which roads were station approach and oak 
lane, which were the roads i had to go along. 
 
so  i  started  walking,  but  siobhan  said  i  didn't  have  to  describe  everything  that  happens,  i  just  have  to 
describe the things that were interesting. 
 
so i got to 451c chapter road, london nw2 5ng, and it took me 27 minutes and there was no one in 
when i pressed the button that said flat c and the only interesting thing that happened on the way was 8 
men dressed up in viking costumes with helmets with horns on and they were shouting, but they weren't 
real vikings because the vikings lived nearly 2,000 years ago

hears's car because we missed the bus. and when we 
were  getting  into  the  car,  mrs.  shears  came  across  the  road  and  said  to  mother,  "you've  got  a  fucking 
nerve." 
 
and mother said, "get into the car, christopher." 
 
but i couldn't get into the car because the door was locked. 
 
and mrs. shears said, "so, has he finally dumped you, too?" 
 
then mother opened her door and got into the car and unlocked my door and i got in and we drove away. 
 
and  when we  got  to  school  siobhan  said,  "so  you're  christopher's  mother."  and siobhan  said  that  she 
was glad to see me again and she asked if i was ok and i said i was tired. and mother explained that i 
was upset because i couldn't do my maths a level so i hadn't been eating properly or sleeping properly. 
 
and then, mother went away and i drew a picture of a bus using perspective so that i didn't think about 
the pain in my chest and it looked like this 

 

 

 
and after lunch siobhan said that she had spoken to

 mrs. gascoyne and she still had my a-level papers in 
3 sealed envelopes in her desk. 
 
so i asked if i could still do my a level. and siobhan said, "i think so. we're going to ring the reverend 
peters  this  afternoon  to  make  sure  he  can  still  come  in  and  be  your  invigilator.  and  mrs.  gascoyne  is 
going to write a letter to the examination board to say that you're going to take the exam after all. and 
hopefully they'll say that that's ok. but we can't know that for sure." then she stopped talking for a few 
seconds. "i thought i should tell you now. so you could think about it." 
 
and i said, "so i could think abou

t what?" 
 
and she said, "is this what you want to do, christopher?" and i thought about the question and i wasn't 
sure what the answer was because i wanted to do my maths a level but i was very tired and when i tried 
to think about maths my brain didn't work properly and when i tried to remember certain facts, like the 
logarithmic  formula  for  the  approximate  number  of  prime  numbers  not  greater  than  x,  i  couldn't 
remember them and this made me frightened. 
 
and siobhan said, "you don't have to do it, christopher. if you say you don't want to do it no one is going 
to be angry with you. and it won't be wrong or illegal or stupid. it will just be what you want and that 
will be fine," 
 
and i said, "i want to do it," because i don't like it when i put things in my timetable and i have to take 
them out again, because when i do that it makes me feel sick. 
 
and siobhan said, "ok." 
 
and she rang the reverend peters and he came into school at 3:27 p.m. and he 
 
 ___________________________
 
ndow in case i cheated. 
 
and when i opened the paper and read through it i couldn't think how to answer any of the questions and 
also i couldn't breathe properly. and i wanted to hit somebody or stab them with my swiss army knife, 
but there wasn't anyone to hit or stab with my swiss army knife except the reverend peters and he was 
very tall and if i hit him or stabbed him with my swiss army knife he wouldn't be my invigilator for the 
rest  of  the  exam.  so  i  took  deep  breaths  like  siobhan  said  i  should  do  when  i  want  to  hit  someone  in 
school and i counted 50 breaths and did cubes of the cardinal numbers as i counted, like this 

1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000, 1331, 1728, 2197, 2744, 3375, 4096, 4913. . . etc. 

and that made me feel a little calmer. but the exam was 2 hours long and 20 minutes had already gone so 
i had to work really fast and i didn't have time to check my answers properly. 
 
and that night, just after i got home, father came back to

wn and looked at the stars in 
the sky and made myself negligible. and when father came out of the house he looked at me for a long 
time and then he punched the fence and made a hole in it and went away. 
 
and i slept a little bit that night because i was doing my maths a level. and i had some spinach soup for 
supper. 
 
and  the  next  day  i  did  paper  2  and  the  reverend  peters  read  the  cost  of  discipleship  by  dietrich 
bonhoeffer, but this time he didn't smoke a cigarette and siobhan made me go into the toilets before the 
exam and sit on my own and do breathing and counting. 
 
and i was playing the 11th hour on my computer that evening when a taxi stopped outside the house. 
mr. shears was in the taxi and he got out of the taxi and threw a big cardboard box of things belonging to 
mother onto the lawn. and they were a hair dryer and some knickers and some l'oréal shampoo and a 
box of muesli and two books, diana: her true story by andrew morton and rivals by jilly cooper

 as he drove away and mrs. shears was looking out of her 
window when mother did this. 
 
the next day i did paper 3 and the reverend peters read the daily mail and smoked three cigarettes. 
 
and this was my favorite question 

prove the following result: 
 
a triangle with sides that can be written in the form n2 + 1, n2 - 1 and 2n (where n > 1) is right-angled. 
 
show, by means of a counterexample, that the converse is false. 

and i was going to write out how i answered the question except siobhan said it wasn't very interesting, 
but i said it was. and she said people wouldn't want to read the answers to a maths question in a book, 
and she said i could put the answer in an appendix, which is an extra chapter at the end of a book which 
people can read if they want to. and that is what i have done. 
 
and then my chest didn't hurt so much and it was easier to breathe. but i still felt sick because i didn't 
know if i'd done well in the exam and because i didn't know if the examination b

to clean it before i used it or i wouldn't use it and sometimes i wet myself because other people were in 
the bathroom. and the corridor outside the room smelled like gravy and the bleach they use to clean the 
toilets at school. and inside the room it smelled like socks and pine air freshener. 
 
and i didn't like waiting to find out about my maths a level. and whenever i thought about the future i 
couldn't see  anything  clearly  in  my  head  and  that  made  a  panic start.  so  siobhan  said  i  shouldn't  think 
about  the  future.  she  said,  "just  think  about  today.  think  about  things  that  have  happened.  especially 
about good things that have happened." 
 
and one of the good things was that mother bought me a wooden puzzle which looked like this 
 

 

 
 
and you had to detach the top part of the puzzle from the bottom part, and it was really difficult. 
 
and another good thing was that i helped mother paint her room white with a hint of wheat, except i
