id and lapsed into a silence that lasted until we
reached my door.
the committee was assembled in the hall with the high gothic
ceiling when i arrived, sitting in folding chairs around two small tables
pushed together to form a unit.
"well," brother jack said, "you are on time. very good, we favor
precision in our leaders."
"brother, i shall always try to be on time," i said.
"here he is, brothers and sisters," he said, "your new spokesman.
now to begin. are we all present?"
"all except brother tod clifton," someone said.
his red head jerked with surprise. "so?"
"he'll be here," a young brother said. "we were working until three
this morning."
"still, he should be on time -- very well," brother jack said, taking
out a watch, "let us begin. i have only a little time here, but a little time is
all that is needed. you all know the events of the recent period, and the role
our new brother has played in them. briefly, you are here to see that it isn't
wasted. we must achieve two things: we must plan m

curving line of the chest rising to the easy pulsing of his throat, to the
square, smooth chin, and saw a small x-shaped patch of adhesive upon the
subtly blended, velvet-over-stone, granite-over-bone, afro-anglo-saxon contour
of his cheek.
he leaned there, looking at us all with a remote aloofness in which i
sensed an unstated questioning beneath a friendly charm. sensing a possible
rival, i watched him warily, wondering who he was.
"ah so, brother tod clifton is late," brother jack said. "our leader of
the youth is late. why is this?"
the young man pointed to his cheek and smiled. "i had to see the
doctor," he said.
"what is this?" brother jack said, looking at the cross of adhesive on
the black skin.
"just a little encounter with the nationalists. with ras the exhorter's
boys," brother clifton said. and i heard a gasp from one of the women who
gazed at him with shining, compassionate eyes.
brother jack gave me a quick look. "brother, you have heard

ton was to return and go over the details with me.
while the discussion continued i studied their faces. they seemed
absorbed with the cause and in complete agreement, blacks and whites. but
when i tried to place them as to type i got nowhere. the big woman who
looked like a southern "sudsbuster" was in charge of women's work, and
spoke in abstract, ideological terms. the shy-looking man with the liver
splotches on his neck spoke with a bold directness and eagerness for action.
and this brother tod clifton, the youth leader, looked somehow like a
hipster, a zoot suiter, a sharpie -- except his head of persian lamb's wool had
never known a straightener. i could place none of them. they seemed familiar
but were just as different as brother jack and the other whites were from all
the white men i had known. they were all transformed, like familiar people
seen in a dream. well, i thought, i'm different too, and they'll see it when
the talk is finished and the action begins. i'll just have to be carefu

antagonize anyone. as it is, someone might resent my being placed in charge.
but when brother tod clifton came into my office to discuss the
street meeting i saw no signs of resentment, but a complete absorption in the
strategy of the meeting. with great care he went about instructing me how to
deal with hecklers, on what to do if we were attacked, and upon how to
recognize our own members from the rest of the crowd. for all his seeming
zoot-suiter characteristics his speech was precise and i had no doubt that he
knew his business.
"how do you think we'll do?" i said when he had finished.
"it'll go

 now i
was surrounded by a group of clifton's youth division, and i could see,
beyond their backs with upturned collars, the faces of the doubtful, the
curious and the convinced in the crowd. it was early and i threw my voice
hard down against the traffic sounds, feeling the damp coldness of the air
upon my cheeks and hands as my voice warmed with my emotion. i had just
begun to feel the pulsing set up between myself and the people, hearing them
answering in staccato applause and agreement when tod clifton caught my
eye, pointing. and over the heads of the crowd and down past the dark
storefronts and blinking neon signs i saw a bristling band of about twenty
men quick-stepping forward. i looked down.
"it's trouble, keep talking," clifton said. "give the boys the signal."
"my brothers, the time has come for action," i shouted. and now i
saw the youth members and some older men move around to the back of the
crowd, and up to meet the advancing group. then something sailed up out of
the dark and lan

support."
"well, you don't have to worry. so far, nearly everything you had
anything to do with has turned out to be what the folks like, even things
some of 'em resisted. take that there," he said, pointing to the wall near my
desk.
it was a symbolic poster of a group of heroic figures: an american
indian couple, representing the dispossessed past; a blond brother (in
overalls) and a leading irish sister, representing the dispossessed present; and
brother tod clifton and a young white couple (it had been felt unwise simply
to show clifton and the girl) surrounded by a group of children of mixed
races, representing the future, a color photograph of bright skin texture and
smooth contrast.
"so?" i said, staring at the legend:
"after the struggle: the rainbow of america's future"
"well, when you first suggested it, some of the members was against
you."
"that's certainly true."
"sho, and they raised the devil about the youth members going into

ing apart when the flag went by. it had been a reminder,
until i'd found the brotherhood, that my star was not yet there . . .
"sure, you know," brother wrestrum said. "everybody wants a flag.
we need a flag that stands for brotherhood, and we need a sign we can
wear."
"a sign?"
"you know, a pin or a button."
"you mean an emblem?"
"that's it! something we can wear, a pin or something like that. so
that when a brother meets a brother they can know it. that way that thing
what happened to brother tod clifton wouldn't have happened . . ."
"what wouldn't have happened?"
he sat back. "don't you know about it?"
"i don't know what you mean."
"it's something that's best forgot about," he said, leaning close, his
big hands gripped and stretched before him. "but you see, there was a rally
and some hoodlums tried to break up the meeting, and in the fighting
brother tod clifton got holt to one of the white brothers by mistake and was
beating him, thought he was one of the hoodlums, he said. things like that

"sure did. that brother clifton goes wild when he gits mad . . . but
what do you think of my idea?"
"i think it should be brought to the attention of the committee," i
said guardedly, as the phone rang. "excuse me a moment, brother," i said.
it was the editor of a new picture magazine requesting an interview
of "one of our most successful young men."
"that's very flattering," i said, "but i'm afraid i'm too busy for an
interview. i suggest, however, that you interview our youth leader, brother
tod clifton; you'll find him a much more interesting subject."
"no, no!" wrestrum said, shaking his head violently as the editor
said, "but we want you. you've --"
"and you know," i interrupted, "our work is considered very
controversial, certainly by some."
"that's exactly why we want you. you've become identified with that
controversy and it's our job to bring such subjects to the eyes of our
readers."
"but so has brother clifton," i said.
"no, sir; you're the man and you owe it to our youth to allow us

 it!"
brother jack turned to me. "is this true?"
"i haven't read it," i said. "i had forgotten that i was interviewed."
"but you remember it now?" brother jack said.
"yes, i do now. and he happened to be in the office when the
appointment was made."
they were silent.
"hell, brother jack," wrestrum said, "it's right here in black and
white. he's trying to give people the idea that he's the whole brotherhood
movement."
"i'm doing nothing of the sort. i tried to get the editor to interview
brother tod clifton, you know that. since you know so little about what i'm
doing, why not tell the brothers what you're up to."
"i'm exposing a double-dealer, that's what i'm doing. i'm exposing
you. brothers, this man is a pure dee opportunist!"
"all right," i said, "expose me if you can, but stop the slander."
"i'll expose you, all right," he said, sticking out his chin. "i'm going
to. he's doing everything i said, brothers. and i'll tell you something else --
he's trying to sew things up so that the members wo

 "there were some
important last-minute details concerning tomorrow's lecture that kept me."
"then you might have saved yourself the trouble and the committee
this lost time," brother jack said.
"i don't understand you," i said, suddenly feverish.
"he means that you are no longer to concern yourself with the
woman question. that's ended," brother tobitt said; and i braced myself for
the attack, but before i could respond brother jack fired a startling question
at me.
"what has become of brother tod clifton?"
"brother clifton -- why, i haven't seen him in weeks. i've been too
busy downtown here. what's happened?"
"he has disappeared," brother jack said, "disappeared! so don't waste
time with superfluous questions. you weren't sent for for that."
"but how long has this been known?"
brother jack struck the table. "all we know is that he's gone. let's
get on with our business. you, brother, are to return to harlem immediately.
we're facing a crisis there, since brother tod clifton has not only disapp

one to applaud their value and they themselves failed to understand it. what
if brother jack were wrong? what if history was a gambler, instead of a force
in a laboratory experiment, and the boys his ace in the hole? what if history
was not a reasonable citizen, but a madman full of paranoid guile and these
boys his agents, his big surprise! his own revenge? for they were outside, in
the dark with sambo, the dancing paper doll; taking it on the lambo with my
fallen brother, tod clifton (tod, tod) running and dodging the forces of
history instead of making a dominating stand.
a train came. i followed them inside. there were many seats and the
three sat together. i stood, holding onto the center pole, looking down the
length of the car. on one side i saw a white nun in black telling her beads,
and standing before the door across the aisle there was another dressed
completely in white, the exact duplicate of the other except that she was
black and her black feet bare. neither of

undreds of people formed for the procession.
i went around giving orders and encouragement in a feverish daze, and yet
seeming to observe it all from off to one side. brothers and sisters turned up
whom i hadn't seen since my return. and members from downtown and
outlying districts. i watched them with surprise as they gathered and
wondered at the depths of their sorrow as the lines began to form.
there were half-draped flags and black banners. there were
black-bordered signs that read:
brother tod clifton
our hope shot down
there was a hired drum corps with crape-draped drums. there was a
band of thirty pieces. there were no cars and very few flowers.
it was a slow procession and the band played sad, romantic, military
marches. and when the band was silent the drum corps beat the time on
drums with muffled heads. it was hot and explosive, and delivery men
avoided the district and the police details were increased in number. and up
and down the streets people looked out of their apartment windows

ain and spreading massed together had
never shared it, and some had been born in other lands. and yet all were
touched; the song had aroused us all. it was not the words, for they were all
the same old slave-borne words; it was as though he'd changed the emotion
beneath the words while yet the old longing, resigned, transcendent emotion
still sounded above, now deepened by that something for which the theory of
brotherhood had given me no name. i stood there trying to contain it as they
brought tod clifton's coffin into the tower and slowly up the spiral stairs.
they set it down upon the platform and i looked at the shape of the cheap
gray coffin and all i could remember was the sound of his name.
the song had ended. now the top of the little mountain bristled with
banners, horns and uplifted faces. i could look straight down fifth avenue to
125th street, where policemen were lined behind an array ot hot-dog wagons
and good humor carts; and among the carts i saw a peanut vendor standing

except to a few young girls, it doesn't matter . . . have you got it? can you
see him? think of your brother or your cousin john. his lips were thick with
an upward curve at the corners. he often smiled. he had good eyes and a
pair of fast hands, and he had a heart. he thought about things and he felt
deeply. i won't call him noble because what's such a word to do with one of
us? his name was clifton, tod clifton, and, like any man, he was born of
woman to live awhile and fall and die. so that's his tale to the minute. his
name was clifton and for a while he lived among us and aroused a few
hopes in the young manhood of man, and we who knew him loved him and
he died. so why are you waiting? you've heard it all. why wait for more,
when all i can do is repeat it?"
they stood; they listened. they gave no sign.

s as senseless as his life was futile.
he had struggled for brotherhood on a hundred street corners and he
thought it would make him more human, but he died like any dog in a road.
"all right, all right," i called out, feeling desperate. it wasn't the way
i wanted it to go, it wasn't political. brother jack probably wouldn't approve
of it at all, but i had to keep going as i could go.
"listen to me standing up on this so-called mountain!" i shouted.
"let me tell it as it truly was! his name was tod clifton and he was full of
illusions. he thought he was a man when he was only tod clifton. he was
shot for a simple mistake of judgment and he bled and his blood dried and
shortly the crowd trampled out the stains. it was a normal mistake of which
many are guilty: he thought he was a man and that men were not meant to
be pushed around. but it was hot downtown and he forgot his history, he
forgot the time and the place. he lost his hold on reality. there was a cop
and a waiting audience but he was tod

cop? what about him? he was a cop. a good citizen. but this cop had an
itching finger and an eager ear for a word that rhymed with 'trigger,' and
when clifton fell he had found it. the police special spoke its lines and the
rhyme was completed. just look around you. look at what he made, look
inside you and feel his awful power. it was perfectly natural. the blood ran
like blood in a comic-book killing, on a comic-book street in a comic-book
town on a comic-book day in a comic-book world.
"tod clifton's one with the ages. but what's that to do with you in
this heat under this veiled sun? now he's part of history, and he has received
his true freedom. didn't they scribble his name on a standardized pad? his
race: colored! religion: unknown, probably born baptist. place of birth: u.s.

i couldn't go on. below, they were waiting, hands and handkerchiefs
shading their eyes. a preacher stepped up and read something out of his
bible, and i stood looking at the crowd with a sense of failure. i had let it
get away from me, had been unable to bring in the political issues. and they
stood there sun-beaten and sweat-bathed, listening to me repeat what was
known. now the preacher had finished, and someone signaled the band

feel the bigness of it and the unknownness of it and a pent-up tension --
whether of tears or anger, i couldn't tell. but as we walked through and
down the hill to the hearse, i could feel it. the crowd sweated and throbbed,
and though it was silent, there were many things directed toward me through
its eyes. at the curb were the hearse and a few cars, and in a few minutes
they were loaded and the crowd was still standing, looking on as we carried
tod clifton away. and as i took one last look i saw not a crowd but the set
faces of individual men and women.
we drove away and when the cars stopped moving there was a grave
and we placed him in it. the gravediggers sweated heavily and knew their
business and their brogue was irish. they filled the grave quickly and we left.
tod clifton was underground.
i returned through the streets as tired as though i'd dug the grave
myself alone. i felt confused and listless moving through the crowds that

stale and wilted flowers, rejected downtown, blazed feverishly on a cart, like
glamorous rags festering beneath a futile spray from a punctured fruit juice
can. the crowd were boiling figures seen through steaming glass from inside
a washing machine; and in the streets the mounted police detail stood looking
on, their eyes noncommittal beneath the short polished visors of their caps,
their bodies slanting forward, reins slackly alert, men and horses of flesh
imitating men and horses of stone. tod clifton's tod, i thought. the
hucksters cried above the traffic sounds and i seemed to hear them from a
distance, unsure of what they said. in a side street children with warped
tricycles were parading along the walk carrying one of the signs, brother
tod clifton, our hope shot down.
and through the haze i again felt the tension. there was no denying
it; it was there and something had to be done before it simmered away in
the heat.

days, but he had missed and there was nothing i could do. but at least he
was dead and out of it.
i sat there a while, growing wilder and fighting against it. i couldn't
leave and i had to keep contact in order to fight. but i would never be the
same. never. after tonight i wouldn't ever look the same, or feel the same.
just what i'd be, i didn't know; i couldn't go back to what i was -- which
wasn't much -- but i'd lost too much to be what i was. some of me, too,
had died with tod clifton. so i would see hambro, for whatever it was
worth. i got up and went out into the hall. the glass was still on the table
and i swept it across the room, hearing it rumble and roll in the dark. then
i went downstairs.

the bar downstairs was hot and crowded and there was a heated
argument in progress over clifton's shooting. i stood near the door and
ordered a bourbon. then someone noticed me, and they tried to draw me in.
"please, not tonight," i said. "he was one of my best friends."
