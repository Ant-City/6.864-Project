â€˜oh yes, sir.â€™

â€˜very well, then.  he is a veterinary surgeon, a farrier, and
horsebreaker.  give me your definition of a horse.â€™

(sissy jupe thrown into the greatest alarm by this demand.)

the general behoof of all the little pitchers.  â€˜girl number twenty

the square finger, moving here and there, lighted suddenly on bitzer,
perhaps because he chanced to sit in the same ray of sunlight which,
darting in at one of the bare windows of the intensely white-washed room,
irradiated sissy.  for, the boys and girls sat on the face of the
inclined plane in two compact bodies, divided up the centre by a narrow
interval; and sissy, being at the corner of a row on the sunny side, came
in for the beginning of a sunbeam, of which bitzer, being at t

his cold eyes would hardly have been eyes, but for the short ends of
lashes which, by bringing them into immediate contrast with something
paler than themselves, expressed their form.  his short-cropped hair
might have been a mere continuation of the sandy freckles on his forehead
and face.  his skin was so unwholesomely deficient in the natural tinge,
that he looked as though, if he were cut, he would bleed white.

â€˜bitzer,â€™ said thomas gradgrind.  â€˜your definition of a horse.â€™

â€˜quadruped.  graminivorous.  forty teeth, namely twenty-four grinders,
four eye-teeth, and twelve incisive.  sheds coat in the spring; in marshy
countries, sheds hoofs, too.  hoofs hard, but requiring to be shod with
iron.  age known by marks in mouth.â€™  thus (and much more) bitzer.

blinking at thomas gradgrind with both eyes at once, and so catching the
light upon his quivering ends of lashes that they looked like the antennÃ¦
of busy insects, put his knuckles to his freckled forehead, and sat down
again.

the third gentleman now stepped forth.  a mighty man at cutting and
drying, he was; a government officer; in his way (and in most other
peopleâ€™s too), a professed pugilist; always in training, always with a
system to force down the general throat like a

girl number twenty stopped then, palpitating, and made him a curtsey.

â€˜why are you tearing about the streets,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, â€˜in this
improper manner?â€™

â€˜i wasâ€”i was run after, sir,â€™ the girl panted, â€˜and i wanted to get
away.â€™

â€˜run after?â€™ repeated mr. gradgrind.  â€˜who would run after _you_?â€™

the question was unexpectedly and suddenly answered for her, by the
colourless boy, bitzer, who came round the corner with such blind speed
and so little anticipating a stoppage on the pavement, that he brought
himself up against mr. gradgrindâ€™s waistcoat and rebounded into the road.

â€˜what do you mean, boy?â€™ said mr. gradgrind.  â€˜what are you doing?  how
dare you dash againstâ€”everybodyâ€”in this manner?â€™  bitzer picked up his
cap, which the concussion had knocked off; and backing, and knuckling his
forehead, pleaded that it was an accident.

addressing sissy.  â€˜itâ€™s as well known in the town asâ€”please, sir, as the
multiplication table isnâ€™t known to the horse-riders.â€™  bitzer tried mr.
bounderby with this.

â€˜he frightened me so,â€™ said the girl, â€˜with his cruel faces!â€™

â€˜oh!â€™ cried bitzer.  â€˜oh!  anâ€™t you one of the rest!  anâ€™t you a
horse-rider!  i never looked at her, sir.  i asked her if she would know
how to define a horse to-morrow, and offered to tell her again, and she

take yourself home. jupe, stay here a moment.  let me hear of your
running in this manner any more, boy, and you will hear of me through the
master of the school.  you understand what i mean.  go along.â€™

the boy stopped in his rapid blinking, knuckled his forehead again,
glanced at sissy, turned about, and retreated.

fallen long ago; but she had kept her life, and
her situation, with an ill-conditioned tenacity that occasioned much
offence and disappointment.

mrs. sparsitâ€™s tea was just set for her on a pert little table, with its
tripod of legs in an attitude, which she insinuated after office-hours,
into the company of the stern, leathern-topped, long board-table that
bestrode the middle of the room.  the light porter placed the tea-tray on
it, knuckling his forehead as a form of homage.

â€˜thank you, bitzer,â€™ said mrs. sparsit.

â€˜thank _you_, maâ€™am,â€™ returned the light porter.  he was a very light
porter indeed; as light as in the days when he blinkingly defined a
horse, for girl number twenty.

â€˜all is shut up, bitzer?â€™ said mrs. sparsit.

â€˜all is shut up, maâ€™am.â€™

â€˜and what,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, pouring out her tea, â€˜is the news of the
day?  anything?â€™

â€˜well, maâ€™am, i canâ€™t say that i have heard anything particular.  our
people are a bad lot, maâ€™am; but that is

no news, unfortunately.â€™

â€˜what are the restless wretches doing now?â€™ asked mrs. sparsit.

â€˜merely going on in the old way, maâ€™am.  uniting, and leaguing, and
engaging to stand by one another.â€™

â€˜it is much to be regretted,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, making her nose more
roman and her eyebrows more coriolanian in the strength of her severity,
â€˜that the united masters allow of any such class-combinations.â€™

â€˜yes, maâ€™am,â€™ said bitzer.

â€˜being united themselves, they ought one and all to set their faces
against employing any man who is united with any other man,â€™ said mrs.
sparsit.

â€˜they have done that, maâ€™am,â€™ returned bitzer; â€˜but it rather fell
through, maâ€™am.â€™

â€˜i do not pretend to understand these things,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, with
dignity, â€˜my lot having been signally cast in a widely different sphere;
and mr. sparsit, as a powler, being also quite out of the pale of any
such dissensions.  i only k

that itâ€™s high time it was done, once for all.â€™

â€˜yes, maâ€™am,â€™ returned bitzer, with a demonstration of great respect for
mrs. sparsitâ€™s oracular authority.  â€˜you couldnâ€™t put it clearer, i am
sure, maâ€™am.â€™

as this was his usual hour for having a little confidential chat with
mrs. sparsit, and as he had already caught her eye and seen that she was
going to ask him something, he made a pretence of arranging the rulers,
inkstands, and so forth, while that lady went on with her tea, glancing
through the open window, down into the street.

â€˜not a very busy day, my lady.  about an average day.â€™  he now and then
slided into my lady, instead of maâ€™am, as an involuntary acknowledgment
of mrs. sparsitâ€™s personal dignity and claims to reverence.

â€˜the clerks,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, carefully brushing an imperceptible
crumb of bread and butter from her left-hand mitten, â€˜are trustworthy,
punctual, and industrious, of course?â€™

â€˜yes, maâ€™am, pretty fair, maâ€™am.  with the usual exception.â€™

by philosophers that in this is comprised the whole duty of manâ€”not a
part of manâ€™s duty, but the whole.

â€˜pretty fair, maâ€™am.  with the usual exception, maâ€™am,â€™ repeated bitzer.

â€˜ahâ€”h!â€™ said mrs. sparsit, shaking her head over her tea-cup, and taking
a long gulp.

ways at all.â€™

â€˜bitzer,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, in a very impressive manner, â€˜do you
recollect my having said anything to you respecting names?â€™

â€˜i beg your pardon, maâ€™am.  itâ€™s quite true that you did object to names
being used, and theyâ€™re always best avoided.â€™

bitzer knuckled his forehead again, and again begged pardon.

â€˜no, bitzer,â€™ continued mrs. sparsit, â€˜say an individual, and i will hear
you; say mr. thomas, and you must excuse me.â€™

â€˜with the usual exception, maâ€™am,â€™ said bitzer, trying back, â€˜of an
individual.â€™

â€˜ahâ€”h!â€™  mrs. sparsit repeated the ejaculation, the shake of the head
over her tea-cup, and the long gulp, as taking up the conversation again
at the point where it had been interrupted.

â€˜an individual, maâ€™am,â€™ said bitzer, â€˜has never been what he ought to
have been, since he

extravagant idler.  he is not worth his salt, maâ€™am.  he wouldnâ€™t get it

â€˜ahâ€”h!â€™ said mrs. sparsit, with another melancholy shake of her head.

â€˜i only hope, maâ€™am,â€™ pursued bitzer, â€˜that his friend and relation may
not supply him with the means of carrying on.  otherwise, maâ€™am, we know
out of whose pocket _that_ money comes.â€™

â€˜ahâ€”h!â€™ sighed mrs. sparsit again, with another melancholy shake of her
head.

â€˜he is to be pitied, maâ€™am.  the last party i have alluded to, is to be
pitied, maâ€™am,â€™ said bitzer.

â€˜yes, bitzer,â€™ said mrs. sparsit.  â€˜i have always pitied the delusion,
always.â€™

nearer, â€˜he is as improvident as any of the people in this town.  and you
know what _their_ improvidence is, maâ€™am.  no one could wish to know it
better than a lady of your eminence does.â€™

â€˜they would do well,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit, â€˜to take example by you,
bitzer.â€™

â€˜thank you, maâ€™am.  but, since you do refer to me, now look at me, maâ€™am.

christmas, maâ€™am: i never touch it.  i donâ€™t even go the length of my

maâ€™am?  what one person can do, another can do.â€™

â€˜as to their wanting recreations, maâ€™am,â€™ said bitzer, â€˜itâ€™s stuff and
nonsense.  _i_ donâ€™t want recreations.  i never did, and i never shall; i
donâ€™t like â€™em.  as to their combining together; there are many of them,
i have no doubt, that by watching and informing upon one another could
earn a trifle now and then, whether in money or good will, and improve
their livelihood.  then, why donâ€™t they improve it, maâ€™am!  itâ€™s the
first consideration of a rational creature, and itâ€™s what they pretend to
want.â€™

â€˜pretend indeed!â€™

â€˜i am sure we are constantly hearing, maâ€™am, till it becomes quite
nauseous, concerning their wives and families,â€™ said bitzer.  â€˜why look

â€˜because they are improvident,â€™ said mrs. sparsit.

â€˜yes, maâ€™am,â€™ returned bitzer, â€˜thatâ€™s where it is.  if they were more
provident and less perverse, maâ€™am, what would they do?  they would say,

â€˜nothing just now, bitzer.â€™

â€˜thank you, maâ€™am.  i shouldnâ€™t wish to disturb you at your meals, maâ€™am,
particularly tea, knowing your partiality for it,â€™ said bitzer, craning a
little to look over into the street from where he stood; â€˜but thereâ€™s a
gentleman been looking up here for a minute or so, maâ€™am, and he has come
across as if he was going to knock.  that _is_ his knock, maâ€™am, no
doubt.â€™

he stepped to the window; and looking out, and drawing in his head again,
confirmed himself with, â€˜yes, maâ€™am.  would you wish the gentleman to be
shown in, maâ€™am?â€™

â€˜i donâ€™t know who it can be,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, wiping her mouth and

â€˜a stranger, maâ€™am, evidently.â€™

â€˜what a stranger can want at the bank at this time of the evening, unless
he comes upon some business for which he is too late, i donâ€™t know,â€™ said
mrs. sparsit, â€˜but i hold a charge in this establishment from mr.
bounderby, and i will never shrink from it.  if to see him is any part of
the duty i have accepted, i will see him.  use your own discretion,
bitzer.â€™

here the visitor, all unconscious of mrs. sparsitâ€™s magnanimous words,
repeated his knock so loudly that the light porter hastened down to open
the door; while mrs. sparsit took the precaution of concealing her little
table, with all its appliances upon it, in a cupboard, and then decamped
up-stairs, that she might appear, if needful, with the greater dignity.

â€˜if you please, maâ€™am, the gentleman would wish to see you,â€™ said bitzer,
with his light eye at mrs. sparsitâ€™s keyhole.

fatherâ€™s manner prepared me for a grim and stony maturity.  i am obliged
to you, of all things, for correcting so absurd a mistake.  pray excuse
my intrusion.  many thanks.  good day!â€™

he bowed himself out; and mrs. sparsit, hiding in the window curtain, saw
him languishing down the street on the shady side of the way, observed of
all the town.

â€˜what do you think of the gentleman, bitzer?â€™ she asked the light porter,
when he came to take away.

â€˜spends a deal of money on his dress, maâ€™am.â€™

â€˜it must be admitted,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, â€˜that itâ€™s very tasteful.â€™

â€˜yes, maâ€™am,â€™ returned bitzer, â€˜if thatâ€™s worth the money.â€™

â€˜besides which, maâ€™am,â€™ resumed bitzer, while he was polishing the table,
â€˜he looks to me as if he gamed.â€™

stephen coloured to find himself with his hat in his hand, in his
gratitude for being spoken to, or in the suddenness of it, or both.  he
made a feint of adjusting the lining, and said, â€˜yes.â€™

â€˜you are the hand they have sent to coventry, i mean?â€™ said bitzer, the
very light young man in question.

stephen answered â€˜yes,â€™ again.

â€˜i supposed so, from their all appearing to keep away from you.  mr.
bounderby wants to speak to you.  you know his house, donâ€™t you?â€™

stephen said â€˜yes,â€™ again.

â€˜i suppose it might.â€™

â€˜suppose it might!  by the lord, you _may_ suppose so.  by george!â€™ said
mr. bounderby, with sundry menacing nods and shakes of his head.  â€˜it
might have been twice twenty.  thereâ€™s no knowing what it would have
been, or wouldnâ€™t have been, as it was, but for the fellowsâ€™ being
disturbed.â€™

louisa had come up now, and mrs. sparsit, and bitzer.

â€˜hereâ€™s tom gradgrindâ€™s daughter knows pretty well what it might have
been, if you donâ€™t,â€™ blustered bounderby.  â€˜dropped, sir, as if she was
shot when i told her!  never knew her do such a thing before.  does her
credit, under the circumstances, in my opinion!â€™

she still looked faint and pale.  james harthouse begged her to take his
arm; and as they moved on very slowly, asked her how the robbery had been
committed.

â€˜why, i am going to tell you,â€™ said bounderby, irritably

i should have begun to tell you before.  you know this lady (for she _is_

â€˜i have already had the honourâ€”â€™

â€˜very well.  and this young man, bitzer, you saw him too on the same
occasion?â€™  mr. harthouse inclined his head in assent, and bitzer
knuckled his forehead.

â€˜very well.  they live at the bank.  you know they live at the bank,
perhaps?  very well.  yesterday afternoon, at the close of business
hours, everything was put away as usual.  in the iron room that this
young fellow sleeps outside of, there was never mind how much.  in the
little safe in young tomâ€™s closet, the safe used for petty purposes,
there was a hundred and fifty odd pound.â€™

â€˜a hundred and fifty-four, seven, one,â€™ said bitzer.

me tell you.  i hadnâ€™t victuals enough to snore.  and i didnâ€™t four seven

bitzer knuckled his forehead again, in a sneaking manner, and seemed at
once particularly impressed and depressed by the instance last given of
mr. bounderbyâ€™s moral abstinence.

â€˜a hundred and fifty odd pound,â€™ resumed mr. bounderby.  â€˜that sum of
money, young tom locked in his safe, not a very strong safe, but thatâ€™s
no matter now.  everything was left, all right.  some time in the night,
while this young fellow snoredâ€”mrs. sparsit, maâ€™am, you say you have

winter evenings, when he has fallen asleep at his table, i have heard
him, what i should prefer to describe as partially choke.  i have heard
him on such occasions produce sounds of a nature similar to what may be
sometimes heard in dutch clocks.  not,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, with a lofty
sense of giving strict evidence, â€˜that i would convey any imputation on
his moral character.  far from it.  i have always considered bitzer a
young man of the most upright principle; and to that i beg to bear my
testimony.â€™

â€˜well!â€™ said the exasperated bounderby, â€˜while he was snoring, _or_
choking, _or_ dutch-clocking, _or_ something _or_ otherâ€”being asleepâ€”some
fellows, somehow, whether previously concealed in the house or not
remains to be seen, got to young tomâ€™s safe, forced it, and abstracted
the contents.  being then disturbed, they made off; letting themselves
out at the main door, and double-locking it again

begins to open and prepare the offices for business.  then, looking at
tomâ€™s safe, he sees the door ajar, and finds the lock forced, and the
money gone.â€™

â€˜where is tom, by the by?â€™ asked harthouse, glancing round.

â€˜he has been helping the police,â€™ said bounderby, â€˜and stays behind at
the bank.  i wish these fellows had tried to rob me when i was at his
time of life.  they would have been out of pocket if they had invested

in his hand, gave a beat upon the crown at every little division of his
sentences, as if it were a tambourine; â€˜to his being seenâ€”night after
nightâ€”watching the bank?â€”to his lurking about thereâ€”after dark?â€”to its
striking mrs. sparsitâ€”that he could be lurking for no goodâ€”to her calling
bitzerâ€™s attention to him, and their both taking notice of himâ€”and to its
appearing on inquiry to-dayâ€”that he was also noticed by the neighbours?â€™
having come to the climax, mr. bounderby, like an oriental dancer, put
his tambourine on his head.

this remarkable case, that the more she thought about it, the more
impossible it appeared; â€˜the differences,â€™ she observed, â€˜being such.â€™

in the drawing-room after dinner, mr. bounderby tried the case of the
robbery, examined the witnesses, made notes of the evidence, found the
suspected persons guilty, and sentenced them to the extreme punishment of
the law.  that done, bitzer was dismissed to town with instructions to
recommend tom to come home by the mail-train.

when candles were brought, mrs. sparsit murmured, â€˜donâ€™t be low, sir.
pray let me see you cheerful, sir, as i used to do.â€™  mr. bounderby, upon
whom these consolations had begun to produce the effect of making him, in
a bull-headed blundering way, sentimental, sighed like some large
sea-animal.  â€˜i cannot bear to see you so, sir,â€™ said mrs. sparsit.  â€˜try

indubitable fact, within the cognizance of this history, that five
minutes after he had left the house in the self-same hat, the same
descendant of the scadgerses and connexion by matrimony of the powlers,
shook her right-hand mitten at his portrait, made a contemptuous grimace
at that work of art, and said â€˜serve you right, you noodle, and i am glad
of it.â€™

mr. bounderby had not been long gone, when bitzer appeared.  bitzer had
come down by train, shrieking and rattling over the long line of arches
that bestrode the wild country of past and present coal-pits, with an
express from stone lodge.  it was a hasty note to inform louisa that mrs.

â€˜sir,â€™ rejoined mrs. sparsit, â€˜there was wont to be an elasticity in you
which i sadly miss.  be buoyant, sir!â€™

mr. bounderby, under the influence of this difficult adjuration, backed
up by her compassionate eye, could only scratch his head in a feeble and
ridiculous manner, and afterwards assert himself at a distance, by being
heard to bully the small fry of business all the morning.

â€˜bitzer,â€™ said mrs. sparsit that afternoon, when her patron was gone on
his journey, and the bank was closing, â€˜present my compliments to young
mr. thomas, and ask him if he would step up and partake of a lamb chop
and walnut ketchup, with a glass of india ale?â€™  young mr. thomas being
usually ready for anything in that way, returned a gracious answer, and
followed on its heels.  â€˜mr. thomas,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, â€˜these plain
viands being on table, i thought you might be tempted.â€™

they all confusedly went out: louisa crying to him that she forgave him,
and loved him still, and that he would one day be sorry to have left her
so, and glad to think of these her last words, far away: when some one
ran against them.  mr. gradgrind and sissy, who were both before him
while his sister yet clung to his shoulder, stopped and recoiled.

for, there was bitzer, out of breath, his thin lips parted, his thin
nostrils distended, his white eyelashes quivering, his colourless face
more colourless than ever, as if he ran himself into a white heat, when
other people ran themselves into a glow.  there he stood, panting and
heaving, as if he had never stopped since the night, now long ago, when
he had run them down before.

â€˜iâ€™m sorry to interfere with your plans,â€™ said bitzer, shaking his head,
â€˜but i canâ€™t allow myself to be done by horse-riders.

they went back into the booth, sleary shutting the door to keep intruders
out.  bitzer, still holding the paralysed culprit by the collar, stood in
the ring, blinking at his old patron through the darkness of the
twilight.

â€˜bitzer,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, broken down, and miserably submissive to
him, â€˜have you a heart?â€™

â€˜the circulation, sir,â€™ returned bitzer, smiling at the oddity of the
question, â€˜couldnâ€™t be carried on without one.  no man, sir, acquainted
with the facts established by harvey relating to the circulation of the
blood, can doubt that i have a heart.â€™

â€˜is it accessible,â€™ cried mr. gradgrind, â€˜to any compassionate
influence?â€™

â€˜it is accessible to reason, sir,â€™ returned the exce

â€˜and to nothing else.â€™

they stood looking at each other; mr. gradgrindâ€™s face as white as the
pursuerâ€™s.

â€˜what motiveâ€”even what motive in reasonâ€”can you have for preventing the
escape of this wretched youth,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, â€˜and crushing his
miserable father?  see his sister here.  pity us!â€™

â€˜sir,â€™ returned bitzer, in a very business-like and logical manner,
â€˜since you ask me what motive i have in reason, for taking young mr. tom
back to coketown, it is only reasonable to let you know.  i have
suspected young mr. tom of this bank-robbery from the first.  i had had
my eye upon him before that time, for i knew his ways.  i have kept my
observations to myself, but i have made them; and i have got ample proofs
against him now, besides his running away, and besides his own
confession, which i was just in ti

ing your house yesterday morning, and following you here.  i am
going to take young mr. tom back to coketown, in order to deliver him
over to mr. bounderby.  sir, i have no doubt whatever that mr. bounderby
will then promote me to young mr. tomâ€™s situation.  and i wish to have
his situation, sir, for it will be a rise to me, and will do me good.â€™

â€˜if this is solely a question of self-interest with youâ€”â€™ mr. gradgrind
began.

â€˜i beg your pardon for interrupting you, sir,â€™ returned bitzer; â€˜but i am
sure you know that the whole social system is a question of
self-interest.  what you must always appeal to, is a personâ€™s
self-interest.  itâ€™s your only hold.  we are so constituted.  i was
brought up in that catechism when i was very young, sir, as you are
aware.â€™

â€˜what sum of money,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, â€˜will you set against your
expected promotion?â€™

â€˜thank you, sir,â€™ returned bitzer, â€˜for hinting at the proposal; but i
will not set any sum against it.  know

ing that your clear head would
propose that alternative, i have gone over the calculations in my mind;
and i find that to compound a felony, even on very high terms indeed,
would not be as safe and good for me as my improved prospects in the
bank.â€™

â€˜bitzer,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, stretching out his hands as though he would
have said, see how miserable i am!  â€˜bitzer, i have but one chance left
to soften you.  you were many years at my school.  if, in remembrance of
the pains bestowed upon you there, you can persuade yourself in any
degree to disregard your present interest and release my son, i entreat
and pray you to give him the benefit of that remembrance.â€™

â€˜i really wonder, sir,â€™ rejoined the old pupil in an argumentative
manner, â€˜to find you taking a position so untenable.  my schooling was
paid for; it was a bargain; and when i came away, th

anybody anything, or render anybody help without purchase.  gratitude was
to be abolished, and the virtues springing from it were not to be.  every
inch of the existence of mankind, from birth to death, was to be a
bargain across a counter.  and if we didnâ€™t get to heaven that way, it
was not a politico-economical place, and we had no business there.

â€˜i donâ€™t deny,â€™ added bitzer, â€˜that my schooling was cheap.  but that
comes right, sir.  i was made in the cheapest market, and have to dispose
of myself in the dearest.â€™

he was a little troubled here, by louisa and sissy crying.

â€˜pray donâ€™t do that,â€™ said he, â€˜itâ€™s of no use doing that: it only
worries.  you seem to think that i have some animosity against young mr.
tom; whereas i have none at all.  i am only going, on the reasonable
grounds i have mentioned, to take him back to coketown.  if he was to

the word was so sharp, that in ten minutes mr. childers, sauntering about
the market-place in a pair of slippers, had his cue, and mr. slearyâ€™s
equipage was ready.  it was a fine sight, to behold the learned dog
barking round it, and mr. sleary instructing him, with his one
practicable eye, that bitzer was the object of his particular attentions.
soon after dark they all three got in and started; the learned dog (a
formidable creature) already pinning bitzer with his eye, and sticking
close to the wheel on his side, that he might be ready for him in the
event of his showing the slightest disposition to alight.

the other three sat up at the inn all night in great suspense.  at eight
oâ€™clock in the morning mr. sleary and the dog reappeared: both in high
spirits.

into how much of futurity?  he saw mrs. sparsit fighting out a daily
fight at the points of all the weapons in the female armoury, with the
grudging, smarting, peevish, tormenting lady scadgers, still laid up in
bed with her mysterious leg, and gobbling her insufficient income down by
about the middle of every quarter, in a mean little airless lodging, a
mere closet for one, a mere crib for two; but did he see more?  did he
catch any glimpse of himself making a show of bitzer to strangers, as the
rising young man, so devoted to his masterâ€™s great merits, who had won
young tomâ€™s place, and had almost captured young tom himself, in the
times when by various rascals he was spirited away?  did he see any faint
reflection of his own image making a vain-glorious will, whereby
five-and-twenty humbugs, past five-and-fifty years of age, each taking
upon himself the name, josiah bounderby of coketown, should for ever dine
in bounderby hall, for ever lodge in bounderby bui
