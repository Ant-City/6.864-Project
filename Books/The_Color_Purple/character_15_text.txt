my arms like suds. it feel like heaven is what it feel like, not like sleeping with mr. at all.

that. but one thing i sure nuff can't stand, the way he call shug mama.

i ain't your fucking mama, shug say. but he don't pay her no mind.

i don't know if i want her to sing, say harpo.

how come? ast shug. that woman you got singing now can't git her ass out the church. folks don't know whether to
dance or creep to the mourner's bench. plus, you dress mary agnes up the right way and you'll make piss pots of money.
yellow like she is, stringy hair and cloudy eyes, the men'll be crazy bout her. ain't that right, grady, she say.

grady look little sheepish. grin. mama you don't miss a thing, he say.

and don't you forgit it, say shug.

all of a sudden shug buddy-buddy again with mr. . they sit on the steps, go down harpo's. walk to the mailbox.

shug laugh and laugh when he got anything to say. show teef and tits aplenty.

me and grady try to carry on like us civilize. but it hard. when i hear shug laugh i want to choke her, slap mr. face.

all this week i suffer. grady and me feel so down he turn to reefer, i turn to prayer.

saturday morning shug put nettie letter in my lap. little fat queen of england stamps on it, plus stamps that got peanuts,
coconuts, rubber trees and say africa. i don't know where england at. don't know where africa at either. so i still don't

us seal the letter up again and put it back in mr. pocket

he walk round with it in his coat all day. he never mention it. just talk and laugh with grady, harpo and swain, and try to
learn how to drive shug car.

i watch him so close, i begin to feel a lightening in the head. fore i know anything i'm standing hind his chair with his
razor open.

then i hear shug laugh, like something just too funny. she say to me, i know i told you i need something to cut this
hangnail with, but albert git real niggerish bout his razor.

mr. look behind him. put that down, he say. women, always needing to cut this and shave that, and always

ood tween us must have been nothing but bodies, she
say. cause i don't know the albert that don't dance, can't hardly laugh, never talk bout nothing, beat you and hid your
sister nettie's letters. who he?

i don't know nothing, i think. and glad of it.


dear god,


now that i know albert hiding nettie's letters, i know exactly where they is. they in his trunk. everything that mean
something to albert go in his trunk. he keep it locked up tight, but shug can git the key.

one night when mr. and grady gone, us open the trunk. us find a lot of shug's underclothes, some nasty picture

postcards, and way down under his tobacco, nettie's letters. bunches and bunches of them. some fat, some thin. some
open, some not.

how us gon do this? i ast shug.

she say. simple. we take the letters out of the envelopes, leave the envelopes just like they is. i don't think he look in this
corner of the trunk much, she say.

i heated the stove, put on the kettle. us steam and steam the envelopes until we had a

then us put the envelopes back inside the trunk.

i'm gonna put them in some kind of order for you, say shug.

yeah, i say, but don't let's do it in here, let's go in you and grady room.

so she got up and us went into they little room. shug sat in a chair by the bed with all nettie letters spread round her, i
got on the bed with the pillows behind my back.

these the first ones, say shug. they postmark right here.


dear celie, the first letter say,


you've got to fight and get away from albert. he ain't no good.

when i left you all's house, walking, he followed me on his horse. when we was well out of sight of the house he caught
up with me and started trying to talk.

dear god,


what with being shock, crying and blowing my nose, and trying to puzzle out words us don't know, it took a long time to

how i'm gon keep from killing him, i say.

don't kill, she say. nettie be coming home before long. don't make her have to look at you like us look at sofia.

but it so hard, i say, while shug empty her suitcase and put the letters inside.

hard to be christ too, say shug. but he manage. remember that. thou shalt not kill, he said. and probably wanted to add
on to that. starting with me. he knowed the fools he was dealing with.

dear nettie,


well, you know wherever there's a man, there's trouble. and it seem like, going to memphis, grady was all over the car.
no matter which way us change up, he want to sit next to squeak.

while me and shug sleeping and he driving, he tell squeak all about life in north memphis, tennessee. i can't half sleep
for him raving bout clubs and clothes and forty-nine brands of beer. talking so much bout stuff to drink make me have to
pee. then us have to find a road going off into the bushes to relieve ourselves.

mr. try to act like he don't care i'm going.

you'll be back, he say. nothing up north 
 
 ___________________________
 
the road.

let me go with you, i say. i can press your clothes, do your hair. it would be like old times, when you was singing at
harpo's.

she say, naw. she can act like she not bored in front of a audience of strangers, a lot of them white, but she wouldn't
have the nerve to try to act in front of me.

besides, she say. you not my maid. i didn't bring you to memphis to be that. i brought you here to love you and help you
get on your feet.

and now she off on the road for two weeks, and me and grady and squeak rattle round the house trying to get our stuff
together. squeak been going round to a lot of clubs and grady been taking her. plus he seem to be doing a little farming
out back the house.

i sit in the dining room making pants after pants. i got pants now in every color and size under the sun. since us started
making pants down home, i ain't been able to stop. i change the cloth, i change the print, i change the waist, i change the
pocket. i change the hem, i change the fullness of t
 
 ___________________________
 
re soft, hardly wrinkle at all, and the little figures in the cloth always look perky and
bright. and they full round the ankle so if she want to sing in 'em and wear 'em sort of like a long dress, she can. plus,
once shug put them on, she knock your eyes out.

miss celie, she say. you is a wonder to behold.

i duck my head. she run round the house looking at herself in mirrors. no matter how she look, she look good.

you know how it is when you don't have nothing to do, i say, when she brag to grady and squeak bout her pants. i sit
here thinking bout how to make a living and before i know it i'm off on another pair pants.

by now squeak see a pair she like. oh, miss celie, she say. can i try on those?

she put on a pair the color of sunset. orangish with a little grayish fleck. she come back out looking just fine. grady look
at her like he could eat her up.

shug finger the pieces of cloth i got hanging on everything. it all soft, flowing, rich and catch the light. this a far cry from
that

learn to be pleasant. he used to be nasty to his own ma.

yall see much of him? i ast.

mary agnes not the same, say harpo.

what you mean? i ast.

i don't know, he say. her mind wander. she talk like she drunk. and every time she turn round look like she want to see
grady.

they both smoke a lot of reefer, i say.

reefer, say harpo. what kind of a thing is that?

something make you feel good, i say. something make you see visions. something make your love come down. but if you
smoke it too much it make you feebleminded. confuse. always need to clutch hold of somebody. grady grow it in the
backyard, i say.

i never heard of such a thing, say sofia. it grow in the ground?

like a weed, i say. grady got half a acre if he got a row.

how big it git? ast harpo.

she put her face in her hands and start to cry. celie, she say, through her fingers, i still love you.

but i just sit there and watch her. seem like all my wonton soup turn to ice.

why you so upset? she ast, when us got back home. you never seem to git upset bout grady. and he was my husband.
grady never bring no sparkle to your eye, i think. but i don't say nothing, i'm too far away.

course, she say, grady so dull, jesus. and when you finish talking bout women and reefer you finish grady. but still, she
say.

i don't say nothing.

she try to laugh. i was so glad he lit out after mary agnes i didn't know what to do, she say. i don't know who tried to

you notice when they left here together going to panama i didn't shed a tear? but now really, she say, what they gon look

poor mary agnes, i think. how could anybody guess old dull grady would end up running a reefer plantation in panama?
course they making boocoos of money, say shug. and mary agnes outdress everybody down there, the way she tell it in
her letters. and at least grady let her sing. what little snatches of her songs she can still remember. but really, she say,
panama? where is it at, anyhow? is it down there round cuba? us ought to go to cuba, miss celie, you know? lots of
gambling there and good times. a lots of colored folks look like mary agnes. some real black, like us. all in the same
family though. try to pass for white, somebody mention your grandma.

i don't say nothing. i pray to die, just so i don't never have to speak.

 though, it feel like it blooming blood.

i talk to myself a lot, standing in front the mirror. celie, i say, happiness was just a trick in your case. just cause you never

you. the whole earth. the stars. but look at you. when shug left, happiness desert.

every once in a while i git a postcard from shug. her and germaine in new york, in california. gone to see mary agnes
and grady in panama.

mr. seem to be the only one understand my feeling.

i know you hate me for keeping you from nettie, he say. and now she dead.

but i don't hate him, nettie. and i don't believe you dead. how can you be dead if i still feel you? maybe, like god, you
changed into something different that i'll have to speak to in a different way, but you not dead to me nettie. and never
will be. sometime when i git tired of talking to myself i talk to you. i even try to reach our children.
