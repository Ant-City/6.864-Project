ere counted, prisoners exchanged,
the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon, and the day for the
necessary battle appointed; after which the armies fell into line and
marched away, and tom turned homeward alone.

as he was passing by the house where jeff thatcher lived, he saw a new
girl in the garden--a lovely little blue-eyed creature with yellow
hair plaited into two long-tails, white summer frock and embroidered
pan-talettes. the fresh-crowned hero fell without firing a shot. a
certain amy lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a
memory of herself behind. he had thought he loved her to distraction;
he had regarded his passion as adoration; and behold it was only a poor
little evanescent partiality. he had been months winning her; she had
confessed hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the proudest
boy in the world only seven short days, and here in one instant of time
she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is
done.

he worshipped this new

the prize was delivered to tom with as much effusion as the
superintendent could pump up under the circumstances; but it lacked
somewhat of the true gush, for the poor fellow�s instinct taught him
that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light,
perhaps; it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two
thousand sheaves of scriptural wisdom on his premises--a dozen would
strain his capacity, without a doubt.

amy lawrence was proud and glad, and she tried to make tom see it in
her face--but he wouldn�t look. she wondered; then she was just a grain
troubled; next a dim suspicion came and went--came again; she watched;
a furtive glance told her worlds--and then her heart broke, and she was
jealous, and angry, and the tears came and she hated everybody. tom most
of all (she thought).

tom was introduced to the judge; but his tongue was tied, his breath
would hardly come, his heart quaked--partly because of the aw

i�ll never love anybody but you, tom, and i�ll never marry anybody
but you--and you ain�t to ever marry anybody but me, either.�

�certainly. of course. that�s _part_ of it. and always coming to school
or when we�re going home, you�re to walk with me, when there ain�t
anybody looking--and you choose me and i choose you at parties, because
that�s the way you do when you�re engaged.�

�it�s so nice. i never heard of it before.�

�oh, it�s ever so gay! why, me and amy lawrence--�

the big eyes told tom his blunder and he stopped, confused.

�oh, tom! then i ain�t the first you�ve ever been engaged to!�

the child began to cry. tom said:

�oh, don�t cry, becky, i don�t care for her any more.�

�yes, you do, tom--you know you do.�

tom tried to put his arm about her neck, but she pushed him away and
turned her face to the wall, and went on crying. tom tried again, with
soothing words in his mouth, and was repulsed again. then his pride was
up, and

es in his vicinity, and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye
in his direction at such times, too. it gratified all the vicious vanity
that was in him; and so, instead of winning him, it only �set him up�
 the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he
knew she was about. presently she gave over skylarking, and moved
irresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and
wistfully toward tom. then she observed that now tom was talking more
particularly to amy lawrence than to any one else. she felt a sharp pang
and grew disturbed and uneasy at once. she tried to go away, but her
feet were treacherous, and carried her to the group instead. she said to
a girl almost at tom�s elbow--with sham vivacity:

�why, mary austin! you bad girl, why didn�t you come to sunday-school?�

�i did come--didn�t you see me?�

�why, no! did you? where did you sit?�

�i was in miss peters� class, where i always go. i saw _you_.�

�did you? why, it�s fun

�my ma�s going to let me have one.�

�oh, goody; i hope she�ll let _me_ come.�

�well, she will. the picnic�s for me. she�ll let anybody come that i
want, and i want you.�

�that�s ever so nice. when is it going to be?�

�by and by. maybe about vacation.�

�oh, won�t it be fun! you going to have all the girls and boys?�

�yes, every one that�s friends to me--or wants to be�; and she glanced
ever so furtively at tom, but he talked right along to amy lawrence
about the terrible storm on the island, and how the lightning tore the
great sycamore tree �all to flinders� while he was �standing within
three feet of it.�

�oh, may i come?� said grace miller.

�yes.�

�and me?� said sally rogers.

�yes.�

�and me, too?� said susy harper. �and joe?�

�yes.�

and so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged
for invitations but tom and amy. then tom turned coolly away, still
talking, and took amy with h

athering his wrath. then he spoke: �who tore this book?�

there was not a sound. one could have heard a pin drop. the stillness
continued; the master searched face after face for signs of guilt.

�benjamin rogers, did you tear this book?�

a denial. another pause.

�joseph harper, did you?�

another denial. tom�s uneasiness grew more and more intense under the
slow torture of these proceedings. the master scanned the ranks of
boys--considered a while, then turned to the girls:

�amy lawrence?�

a shake of the head.

�gracie miller?�

the same sign.

�susan harper, did you do this?�

another negative. the next girl was becky thatcher. tom was trembling
from head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of the
situation.

�rebecca thatcher� [tom glanced at her face--it was white with
terror]--�did you tear--no, look me in the face� [her hands rose in
appeal]--�did you tear this book?�

a thought shot like lightning through tom�s brain. he sprang
