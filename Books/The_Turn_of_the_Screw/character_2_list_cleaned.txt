[CHARACTER] - 
                a
ten-year-old boy, the elder of the governess's two charges. [CHARACTER]
is charming and very attractive. he seems unnaturally well behaved
and agreeable for a child, never fights with his sister, and tries constantly
to please his governess. he is expelled from school for an unspecified
but seemingly sinister reason, and although he seems to be a good
child, he often hints that he is capable of being bad. the governess
is alarmed by the fact that [CHARACTER] never refers to his own past and
suspects that wicked secrets belie his perfect exterior.
