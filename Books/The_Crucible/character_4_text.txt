disciplines were beginning to rankle. but, as in all such matters, the issue was not clear-
cut, for danger was still a possibility, and in unity still lay the best promise of safety. 

the edge of the wilderness was close by. the american con-tinent stretched endlessly 
west,  and  it  was  full  of  mystery  for  them.  it  stood,  dark  and  threatening,  over  their 
shoulders  night  and  day,  for  out  of  it  indian  tribes  marauded  from  time  to  time,  and 
reverend parris had parishioners who had lost relatives to these heathen. 

the  parochial  snobbery  of  these  people  was  partly  responsible  for  their  failure  to 
convert the indians. probably they also pre-ferred to take land from heathens rather than 
from  fellow  christians.  at  any  rate,  very  few  indians  were  converted,  and  the  salem 
folk believed that the virgin forest was the devil’s last preserve, his home base and the 
citadel of his final stand. to the best of their knowledge

morality; one could cry witch against one’s neighbor and feel perfectly justified in the 
bargain. old scores could be settled on a plane of heavenly combat between lucifer and 
the lord; suspicions and the envy of the miserable toward the happy could and did burst 
out in the general revenge. 
 
reverend parris is praying now, and, though we cannot hear his words, a sense of his 
confusion  hangs  about  him.  he  mumbles,  then  seems  about  to  weep;  then  he  weeps, 
then,prays again; but his daughter does not stir on the bed. 
 
the door opens, and his negro slave enters. tituba is in her forties. parris brought her 
with him from barbados, where he spent some years as a merchant before entering the 
ministry. she enters as one does who can no longer bear to be barred from the sight of

s  of  each  side  are  at  work  undermining  the  other.  but  this  is  a 
snobbish  objection  and  not  at  all  warranted by  the  facts.  i  have  no  doubt  that  people 
were communing with, and even worshiping, the devil in salem, and if the whole truth 
could  be  known  in  this  case,  as  it  is  in  others,  we  should  dis-cover  a  regular  and 
conventionalized'  propitiation  of  the  dark  spirit,  one  certain  evidence  of  this  is  the 
confession of tituba, the slave of reverend parris, and another is the behavior of the, 
children who were known to have indulged in sorceries with her. 

there are accounts of similar klatches in europe, where the daughters of the towns 
would assemble at night and, sometimes with fetishes, sometimes with a selected young 
man, give them-selves to love, with some bastardly results. the church, sharp-eyed as it 
must be when gods long dead are brought to life, condemned these orgies as witchcraft 
and interpreted them, rightly, as a resurgence

herrick, herrick, it is a needle! 
herrick comes toward aim. 
proctor, angrily, bewildered: and what signifies a needle! 
 
cheever, his hands shaking: why, this go hard with her, proc-tor, this - i had 
my doubts, proctor, i had my doubts, but here’s' calamity. to hale, showing the 
needle: you see it, sir, it is a needle! 
 
hale: why? what meanin’ has it? 
 
cheever, wide-eyed, trembling: the girl, the williams girl, abi-gail williams, 
sir. she sat to dinner in reverend parris’s house tonight, and without word nor 
warnin’  she  falls  to  the  floor.  like  a  struck  beast,  he  says,  and  screamed  a 
scream that a bull would weep to hear. and he goes to save her, and, stuck two 
inches in the flesh of her belly, he draw a needle out. and demandin’ of her how 
she come to be so stabbed, she - to proctor now - testify it -were your wife’s 
familiar spirit pushed it in. 
 
proctor:  why,  she  done  it  herself!  to  hale:  i  hope  you’re  not
