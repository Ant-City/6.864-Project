                Plato
divides his just society into three classes: the producers, the
auxiliaries, and the guardians. The auxiliaries are the warriors,
responsible for defending the city from invaders, and for keeping
the peace at home. They must enforce the convictions of the guardians,
and ensure that the producers obey.
