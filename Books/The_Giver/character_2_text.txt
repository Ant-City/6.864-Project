adjective.

he had waited a long time for this special december. now that it
was almost upon him, he wasn't frightened, but he was ... eager, he
decided. he was eager for it to come. and he was excited,
certainly. all of the elevens were excited about the event that would
be coming so soon.

but there was a little shudder of nervousness when he thought
about it, about what might happen.

apprehensive, jonas decided. that's what i am.

"who wants to be the first tonight, for feelings?" jonas's father
asked, at the conclusion of their evening meal.

it was one of the rituals, the evening telling of feelings.



sometimes jonas and his sister, lily, argued over turns, over who
would get to go first. their parents, of course, were part of the
ritual; they, too, told their feelings each evening. but like all parents-
-all adults-they didn't fight and wheedle for their turn.

nor did jonas, tonight. his feelings were too complicated this
evening. he wanted to share them, but he wasn't eager to b

guess not," lily decided. "i guess i feel a little sorry for him. and
sorry i made a fist." she grinned.



jonas smiled back at his sister. lily's feelings were always





straightforward, fairly simple, usually easy to resolve. .he guessed
that his own had been, too, when he was a seven.

he listened politely, though not very attentively, while his father
took his turn, describing a feeling of worry that he'd had that day at
work: a concern about one of the newchildren who wasn't doing
well. jonas's father's title was nurturer. he and the other nurturers
were responsible for all the physical and emotional needs of every
newchild during its earliest life. it was a very important job, jonas
knew, but it wasn't one that interested him much.

"what gender is it?" lily asked.

"male," father said. "he's a sweet little male with a lovely
disposition. but he isn't growing as fast as he should, and he

"it's just an ordinary room," he commented. "i thought maybe they'd
have it in the auditorium, so that everybody could come. all the old
go to ceremonies of release. but i suppose that when it's just a
newborn, they don't-"

"shhh," the giver said, his eyes on the screen. jonas's father,
wearing his nurturing uniform, entered the room, cradling a tiny
newchild wrapped in a soft blanket in his arms. a uniformed woman
followed through the door, carrying a second newchild wrapped in a
similar blanket.



"that's my father." jonas found himself whispering, as if he might
wake the little ones if he spoke aloud. "and the other nurturer is his
assistant. she's still in training, but she'll be finished soon."

the two nurturers unwrapped the blankets and laid the identical
newborns on
