Viola
Like most of Shakespeare's heroines, Viola is a tremendously
likable figure. She has no serious faults, and we can easily discount
the peculiarity of her decision to dress as a man, since it sets
the entire plot in motion. She is the character whose love seems
the purest. The other characters' passions are fickle: Orsino jumps
from Olivia to Viola, Olivia jumps from Viola to Sebastian, and
Sir Toby and Maria's marriage seems more a matter of whim than an
expression of deep and abiding passion. Only Viola seems to be truly,
passionately in love as opposed to being self-indulgently
lovesick. As she says to Orsino, describing herself and her love
for him:

                             She pined in thought,
                    And
with a green and yellow melancholy
                    She sat
like patience on a monument,
                    Smiling at grief.
Was not this love indeed? 
                    
                           
                           
                           (II.iv.111-114)


The audience, like Orsino, can only answer with an emphatic yes.

Viola's chief problem throughout the play is one of identity. Because
of her disguise, she must be both herself and Cesario. This mounting
identity crisis culminates in the final scene, when Viola finds
herself surrounded by people who each have a different idea of who
she is and are unaware of who she actually is.
Were Twelfth Night not a comedy, this pressure
might cause Viola to break down. Sebastian's appearance at this
point, however, effectively saves Viola by allowing her to be herself
again. Sebastian, who independent of his sister is not much of a
character, takes over the aspects of Viola's disguise that she no
longer wishes to maintain. Thus liberated by her brother, Viola
is free to shed the roles that she has accumulated throughout the
play, and she can return to being Viola, the woman who has loved
and won Orsino.
