i remember the day the aleut ship came to our island. at first it seemed like a small shell afloat on the sea. then it grew
larger and was a gull with folded wings. at last in the rising sun it became what it really was - a red ship with two red sails.
my brother and i had gone to the head of a canyon that winds down to a little harbour which is called coral cove. we had
gone to gather roots that grow there in the spring.
my brother ramo was only a little boy half my age, which was twelve. he was small for one who had lived so many suns and
moons, but quick as a cricket. also foolish as a cricket when he was excited. for this reason and because i wanted him to help
me gather roots and not go running off, i said nothing about the shell i saw or the gull with folded wings.
i went on digging in the brush with my pointed stick as though nothing at all were happening on the sea. even when i knew
for sure that the gull was a ship with

 two red sails.
but ramo's eyes missed little in the world. they were black like a lizard's and very large and, like the eyes of a lizard, could
sometimes look sleepy. this was the time when they saw the most. this was the way they looked now. they were halfclosed,
like those of a lizard lying on a rock about to hick out its tongue to catch a fly.
'the sea is smooth,' ramo said. ‘it is a flat stone without any scratches.'
my brother liked to pretend that one thing was another. 
'the sea is not a stone without scratches,' i said. 'it is water and no waves.
'to me it is a blue stone,' he said. 'and far away on the edge of it is a small cloud which sits on the stone.'
'clouds do not sit on stones. on blue ones or black ones or any kind of stones.
'this one does.’ 'not on the sea,' i said. ‘dolphins sit there, and gulls, and cormorants, and otter, and whales too

, but not
clouds.'
'it is a whale, maybe.'
ramo was standing on one foot and then the other, watching the ship coming, which he did not know was a ship because he
had never seen one. i had never seen one either, but i knew how they looked because i had been told.
'while you gaze at the sea,' i said, ‘i dig roots. and it is i who will eat them and you who will not.' ramo began to punch at
the earth with his stick, but as the ship came closer, its sails showing red through the morning mist, he kept watching it, acting
all the time as if he were not.
'have you ever seen a red whale?' he asked.
'yes,' i said, though i never had.
'these i have seen are grey.’
'you are very young and have not seen everything that swims in the world.'
ramo picked up a root and was about to drop it into the basket. suddenly his mouth opened wide and then closed again.
'a canoe!' he c

d they did not come to our village. but this is not to say
that we did not know what they did - what they ate and in what way they cooked it, how many otter were killed each day, and
other things as well - for someone was always watching from the cliffs while they were hunting, or from the ravine when they
were in camp.
ramo, for instance, brought news about captain orlov.
'in the morning when he crawls out of his tent he sits on a rock and combs until the beard shines like a cormorant's wing,'
ramo said.
my sister ulape, who was two years older than i, gathered the most curious news of all. she swore that there was an aleut
girl among the hunters.
'she is dressed in skins just like the men,' ulape said. ‘but she wears a fur cap and under the cap she has thick hair that falls
to her waist.'
no one believed ulape. everyone laughed at the idea that hunters would bother to bring their wives with them.
the aleuts also watched our village, otherwise they would not have known about the good for

 cove, and to sleep beside it during the night, meant that they were there to watch the
aleuts, to give the alarm should captain orlov try to sail off without paying us for the otter skins.
everyone was afraid he might, so besides the men in the cove who watched the aleut ship, others kept watch on the camp.
every hour someone brought news. ulape said that the aleut woman spent a whole afternoon cleaning her skin aprons, which
she had not done before while she had been there. early one morning, ramo said he had just seen captain orlov carefully
trimming his beard so that it looked the way it did when he first came. the aleuts who sharpened the long spears stopped this
work and gave all their time to skinning the otter which were brought in at dusk.
we in the village of ghalas-at knew that captain orlov and his hunters were getting ready to leave the island. would he pay
us for the otter he had slain or would he try to sneak away in the night ! \would our men have to fight for our rightful s

beyond the village. there will be grumbling in ghalas-at because of this. there will be shirkers. these will be
punished, for without the help of all, all must perish.'
kimki portioned work for each one in the tribe, giving ulape and me the task of gathering abalones. this shellfish grew on
the rocks along the shore and was plentiful. we gathered them at low tide in baskets and carried them to the mesa where we
cut the dark red flesh from the shell and placed it on flat rocks to dry in the sun.
ramo had the task of keeping the abalones safe from the gulls and especially the wild dogs. dozens of our animals, which
had left the village when their owners had died, joined the wild pack that roamed the island. they soon grew as fierce as the
wild ones and only came back to the village to steal food. each day towards evening ulape and i helped ramo put the
abalones in baskets and carry them to the village for safekeeping.
during this time other women were gathering the scarlet apples that grow on

hich was here last spring ?'
'no.’
matasaip was silent, pondering the news. then he told us to go on to where the canoes were and wait for him, for he was
going back. it was light now and we went quickly over the dunes to the edge of the cliff and stood there while the sun rose.
the wind grew cold, but fearing that those on the ship would see the smoke we did not start a fire, though we had meal to
cook for breakfast. instead we ate a small quantity of dried abalone, and afterwards my brother ramo climbed over the cliff.
no one had been down to the rocks since the canoes were hidden so we did not know whether they were still safe or not.
while he was gone we saw a man running across the dunes. it was nanko, carrying a message from matasaip. he was
swearing in spite, of the cold and he stood trying to catch his breath. we all waited, urging him to talk, but his face was happy
and we knew that he brought good news.
'speak!' everyone said in a chorus.
'i have been running for more than a lea

ose and cheekbones. the mark meant that she was unmarried.
'the ship leaves,' shouted nanko.
'if it goes,' ulape shouted back, ‘it will come again after the storm.'
my sister was in love with nanko; but she laughed at him.
'other men will come to the island,' she said. 'they will be far more handsome and brave than those who leave.'
'you are all women of such ugliness that they will be afraid and soon go away.
the wind blew in fierce gusts as we left the village, stinging our faces with sand. ramo hopped along far in front with one of
our baskets, but before long he ran hack to say that he had forgotten his fishing spear. nanko was standing on the cliff
motioning us to hurry, so i refused to let him go back for it.
the ship was anchored outside the cove and nanko said that it could not come closer to the shore because of the high waves.
they were beating against the rocks with the sound of thunder. the shore as far as i could see was rimmed with foam.
two boats were pulled up on the beach

. beside them stood four white men and as we came down the trail, one of the men
beckoned us to walk faster. he spoke to us in a language which we could not understand.
the men of our tribe, except nanko and chief matasaip, were already on the ship. my brother ramo was there too, nanko
said. he had run on ahead after i had told him that he could not go back to the village for his spear. nanko said that he had
jumped into the first boat that left the cove. 
matasaip divided the women into two groups. then the boats were pushed into the water, and while they bobbed about we
scrambled into them as best we could.
the cove was partly sheltered from the wind, but as soon as we went through the passage between the rocks and into the sea,
great waves struck us. th

wait for ramo,' he said. 'if we' do, the ship will be driven on the rocks.'
'we must!' i shouted. 'we must!'
'the ship will come back for him on another day, matasaip said. 'he will be safe. there is food for him to eat and water to 
drink and places to sleep.
'no,' i cried.
matasaip's face was like stone. he was not listening. i cried out once more, but my voice was lost in the howling wind.
people gathered around me, saying again what matasaip had said, yet i was not comforted by their words.
ramo had disappeared from the cliff and i knew that he was now running along the trail that led to the beach.
the ship began to circle the kelp bed and i thought surely that it was going to return to the shore. i held my breath, waiting.
then slowly its direction changed. it pointed towards the east. at that moment i walked across the deck and, though many
hands tried to hold me back, flung myself into the sea.
a wave passed over my head and i went down and down until i thought i would never behold t

 day again. the ship was far
away when i rose. only the sails showed through the spray. i was still clutching the basket that held all of my things, but it
was very heavy and i realized that i could not swim with it in my arms. letting it sink, i started off towards the shore.
i could barely see the two rocks that guarded the entrance to coral cove, but i was not fearful. many times i had swum
farther than this, although not in a storm.
i kept thinking over and over as i swam how i would punish ramo when i reached the shore, yet when i felt the sand under
my feet and saw him standing at the edge of the waves, holding his fishing spear and looking so forlorn, i forgot all those
things i planned to do. instead i fell to my knees and put my arms around him.
the ship had disappeared.
'when will it come back?' ramo asked. there were tears in his eyes.
'soon,' i said
the only thing that made me angry was that my beautiful skirt of yucca fibres, which i had worked on so long and carefully,
was rui

and by its light we reached the village.
the huts looked like ghosts in the cold light. as we neared them i heard a strange sound like that of running feet. i thought
that it was a sound made by the wind, but when we came closer i saw dozens of wild dogs scurrying around through the huts.
they ran from us, snarling as they went.
the pack must have slunk into the village soon after we left, for it had gorged itself upon the abalone we had not taken. it had
gone everywhere searching out food, and ramo and i had to look hard to find enough for our supper. while we ate beside a
small fire i could hear the dogs on the hill not far away, and through the night their howls came to me on the wind. but when
the sun rose and i went out of the hut, the pack trotted off towards its lair which was at the north side of the island, in a large
cave.
that day we spent gathering food. the wind blew and the waves crashed against the shore so that we could not go out on the
rocks. i gathered gull eggs on the cl

iff and ramo speared a string of small fish in one of the tide pools. he brought them
home, walking proudly with the string over his back. he felt that in this way he had made up for the trouble he had caused.
with the seeds i had gathered in a ravine, we had a plentiful meal, although i had to cook it on a hat rock. my bowls were at
the bottom of the sea. the wild dogs came again that night. drawn by the scent of fish, they sat on the hill, barking and
growling at each other. i could see the light from the

fire shining in their eyes. at dawn they left.
the ocean was calm on this day and we were able to hunt abalone among the rocks. from seaweed we wove a rough basket
which we filled before the sun was overhead. on the way home, carrying the abalone between us, ramo and i stopped on the
cliff. the air was dear and we could look far out to sea in the direction the ship had gone.
'will it come back today?' ramo asked.
'it may,' i answered him, though i did not think so. ‘more likely it will come after many suns, for the country where it has
gone is far off.'
ramo looked up at me. his black eyes shone.
'i do not care if the ship never comes,' he said. 
'why do you say this?' i asked him.
ramo thought, making a hole in the earth with the point of his spear.
'why !' i asked again.
'because i like it here with you,' he said. ‘it is more him than when the others were here. tomorrow i am going to where t

he
canoes are hidden and bring one back to coral cove. we will use it to fish in and to go looking around the island.'
'they are too heavy for you to put into the water.
'you will see.'
ramo threw out his chest. around his neck was a string of sea-elephant teeth which someone had left behind. it was much too
large for him and the teeth were broken, but they rattled as he thrust the spear down between us.
'you forget that i am the son of chowig,' he said.
'i do not forget,' i answered. ‘but you are a small son. someday you will be tall and strong and then you will be able to handle
a big canoe.'
'i am the son of chowig,' he said again, and as he spoke his eyes suddenly grew large.

‘i am his son and since he is dead i
have taken his place. i am now chief of ghalas-at. all my wishes must be obeyed.'
'but first you must become a man. as is the custom, therefore, i will have to whip you with a switch of nettles and then tie
you to a red-ant hill.'
ramo grew pale. he had seen the rites of manhood given in our vibe and remembered them. quickly i said, ‘since there are
no men to give the rites, per- haps you will not have to undergo the nettles and the ants, chief ramo.
'i do not know if this name suits me,' he said, smiling. he tossed his spear at a passing gull. 'i will think of something better.
i watched him stride off to get the spear, a little boy with thin arms and legs like sticks, wearing a big string of sea-elephant
teeth. now that he

 had become chief of ghalas-at, i would have even more trouble with him, but i wanted to run after him 
and take him in my arms.
'i have thought of a name,' he said when he came back.
'what is it?' i asked solemnly.
"i am chief tanyositlopai.'
'that is a very long name and hard to say.
'you will soon learn.' chief tanyositlopai said. i had no thought of letting chief tanyositlopai go alone to the place where
the canoes were hidden, but the next morning when i awoke i found that ramo was not in the hut. he was not outside either,
and i knew then that he had got up in the dark and left by himself.
i was frightened. i thought of all that might befall him. he had climbed down the kelp rope once before, but he would have
trouble pushing even the smallest of the canoes off the rocks. and if he did get one afloat without hurting himself, would he
be able to paddle around the sa

ndpits where the tides ran fast !
thinking of these dangers, i started off to overtake him.
i had not gone far along the trail before i began to wonder if i should not let him go to the cliff by himself. there was no way
of telling when the ship would come back for us. until it did, we were alone upon the island. ramo therefore would have to
be- come a man sooner than if we were not alone, since i would need his help in many ways.
suddenly i turned around and took the trail to- wards coral cove. if ramo could put the canoe in the water and get through
the tides that raced around the sandpits, he would reach the harbour when the sun was tall in the sky. i would be waiting on
the beach, for what was the fun of a voyage if no one were there to greet him !
i put ramo out of my mind as i searched the rocks for mus

ther than my eyes could reach.
the sun moved higher. there was no sign of ramo. i began to feel uneasy. the basket was filled and i carried it up to the 
mesa.
from here i looked down on the harbour and farther on along the coast to the spit that thrust out like a fishhook into the
ocean. i could see the small waves sliding up the sand and beyond them a curving line of foam where the currents raced.
i waited on the mesa until the sun was overhead. then i hurried back to the village, hoping that ramo might have come back
while i was gone. the hut was empty.
quickly i dug a hole for the shellfish, rolled a heavy stone over the opening to protect them from the wild dogs, and started
off towards the south part of the island.
two nails led there, one on each side of a long sand dune. ramo was not on the trail i was travelling and, thinking that he
might be coming back out of sight along the other one, i called to him as i ran. i heard no answer. but i did hear, far off, the
barking of dogs.

em and they were moving
around in a circle.
in the middle of the circle was ramo. he was lying on his back, and had a deep wound in his throat. he lay very still.
when i picked him up i knew that he was dead. there were other wounds on his body from the teeth of the wild dogs. he had
been dead a long time and from his footsteps on the earth i could see that he had never reached the cliff.
two dogs lay on the ground not far from him, and in the side of one of them was his broken spear.
i carried ramo back to the village, reaching it when the sun was far down. the dogs followed me all the way, but when i had
laid him down in the hut, and came out with a club in my hand, they trotted off to a low hill. a big grey dog with long curling
hair and yellow eyes was their leader and he went last.
it was growing dark, but i followed them up the hill. slowly they retreated in front of me, not making a sound. i followed
them across two hills and a small valley to a third hill whose face was a ledge of r
