screaming  from  the  sidelines,  rooting  me  on—a  loud  stadium  roar.
hotdogs  and  popcorn—stadium  smells,  stadium  heat.  a  squad  of
cheerleaders did cartwheels along the banks of the rainy river; they had
megaphones  and  pompoms  and  smooth  brown  thighs.  the  crowd
swayed left and right. a marching band played fight songs. all my aunts
and  uncles  were  there,  and  abraham  lincoln,  and  saint  george,  and  a
nine-year-old  girl  named  linda  who  had  died  of  a  brain  tumor  back  in
fifth grade, and several members of the united states senate, and a blind
poet scribbling notes, and lbj, and huck finn, and abbie hoffman, and
all the dead soldiers back from the grave, and the many thousands who
were later to die—villagers with terrible burns, little kids without arms or
legs—yes, and the joint chiefs of staff were there, and a couple of popes,
and a first lieutenant named jimmy cross, and the last surviving veteran
of the am

the lives of the dead


but this too is true: stories can save us. i'm forty-three years old, and a
writer now, and even still, right here, i keep dreaming linda alive. and
ted lavender, too, and kiowa, and curt lemon, and a slim young man i
killed,  and  an  old  man  sprawled  beside  a  pigpen,  and  several  others
whose bodies i once lifted and dumped into a truck. they're all dead. but
in a story, which is a kind of dreaming, the dead sometimes smile and sit
up and return to the world.

start  here:  a  body  without  a  name.  on  an  afternoon  in  1969  the
platoon took sniper fire from a filthy little village along the south china
sea.  it  la

"it wasn't guts. i was scared."
kiowa shrugged. "same difference."



"no,  i  couldn't do  it.  a  mental  block  or  something  .  .  .  i  don't  know,

just creepy."

"well, you're new here. you'll get used to it." he paused for a second,
studying  the  green  and  red  sprinkles  on  a  cookie.  "today—i  guess  this
was your first look at a real body?"

i shook my head. all day long i'd been picturing linda's face, the way

she smiled.

"it sounds funny," i said, "but that poor old man, he reminds me of... i
mean, there's this girl i used to know. i took her to the movies once. my
first date."

kiowa looked at me for a long while. then he leaned back and smiled.
"man," he said, "that's a bad date."



linda  was  nine  then,  as  i  was,  but  we  were  in  love.  and  it  was  real.
when i write about her now, three decades later, it's tempting to dismiss
it as a crush, an infatuation of childhoo

es,  i  remember,  were  deep
brown  like  her  hair,  and  she  was  slender  and  very  quiet  and  fragile-
looking.

even then, at nine years old, i wanted to live inside her body. i wanted

to melt into her bones—that kind of love.

and so in the spring of 1956, when we were in the fourth grade, i took
her out on the first real date of my life—a double date, actually, with my
mother  and  father.  though  i  can't  remember  the  exact  sequence,  my
mother had somehow arranged it with linda's parents, and on that damp
spring night my dad did the driving while linda and i sat in the back seat
and  stared  out  opposite  windows,  both  of  us  trying  to  pretend  it  was
nothing special. for me, though, it was very special. down inside i had
important things to tell her, big profound things, but i couldn't make any
words come out. i had trouble breathing. now and then i'd glance over at
her,  thinking  how  beautiful  she  was:  her  white  skin  and  those  dark

cking  cap,
basically,  except  the  tapered  part  at  the  top  seemed  extra  long,  almost
too long, like a tail growing out of the back of her head. it made me think
of the caps that santa's elves wear, the same shape and color, the same
fuzzy white tassel at the tip.

sitting  there  in  the  back  seat,  i  wanted  to  find  some  way  to  let  her
know how i felt, a compliment of some sort, but all i could manage was a
stupid comment about the cap. "jeez," i must've said, "what a cap."

linda smiled at the window—she knew what i meant—but my mother
turned and gave me a hard look. it surprised me. it was as if i'd brought
up some horrible secret.

for the rest of the ride i kept my mouth shut. we parked in front of
the  ben  franklin  store  and  walked  up  main  street  toward  the  state
theater. my parents went first, side by side, and then linda in her new
red cap, and then me tailing along ten or twenty steps behind. i was nine
years  old;  i  didn't  yet  have  the  gift

for  small  talk.  now  and  then  my
mother glanced back, making little motions with her hand to speed me
up.

at the ticket booth, i remember, linda stood off to one side. i moved
over to the concession area, studying the candy, and both of us were very
careful  to  avoid  the  awkwardness  of  eye  contact.  which  was  how  we
knew about being in love. it was pure knowing. neither of us, i suppose,
would've thought to use that word, love, but by the fact of not looking at
each  other,  and  not  talking,  we  understood  with  a  clarity  beyond
language that we were sharing something huge and permanent.

behind me, in the theater, i hear

we  could  almost  see  ted  lavender's  dreamy  blue  eyes.  we  could

almost hear him.

"roger that," somebody said. "i'm ready to fly."
there  was  the  sound  of  the  wind,  the  sound  of  birds  and  the  quiet

afternoon, which was the world we were in.



that's what a story does. the bodies are animated. you make the dead
talk. they sometimes say things like, "roger that." or they say, "timmy,
stop crying," which is what linda said to me after she was dead.


even now i can see her walking down the aisle of the old state theater
in worthington, minnesota. i can see her face in profile beside me, the
cheeks softly lighted by coming attractions.

the movie that night was the man who never was. i remember the
plot  clearly,  or  at  least  the  premise,  because  the  main  character  was  a
corpse.  that  fact  alone,  i  know,  deeply  impressed  me.  it  was  a  world

body—a  british  soldier,  i  believe;  they  dress  him  up  in  an  officer's
uniform, plant fake documents in his pockets, then dump him in the sea
and let the currents wash him onto a nazi beach. the germans find the
documents; the deception wins the war. even now, i can remember the
awful splash as that corpse fell into the sea. i remember glancing over at
linda,  thinking  it  might  be  too  much  for  her,  but  in  the  dim  gray  light
she seemed to be smiling at the screen. there were little crinkles at her
eyes,  her  lips  open  and  gently  curving  at  the  corners.  i  couldn't
understand it. there was nothing to smile at. once or twice, in fact, i had
to  close  my  eyes,  but  it  didn't  help  much.  even  then  i  kept  seeing  the
soldier's  body  tumbling  toward  the  water,  splashing  down  hard,  how

y dead.

it was a relief when the movie finally ended.
afterward, we drove out to the dairy queen at the edge of town. the
night  had  a  quilted,  weighted-down  quality,  as  if  somehow  burdened,
and all around us the minnesota prairies reached out in long repetitive
waves  of  corn  and  soybeans,  everything  flat,  everything  the  same.  i
remember  eating  ice  cream  in  the  back  seat  of  the  buick,  and  a  long
blank  drive  in  the  dark,  and  then  pulling  up  in  front  of  linda's  house.
things  must've  been  said,  but  it's  all  gone  now  except  for  a  few  last
images. i remember walking her to the front door. i remember the brass
porch light with its fierce yellow glow, my own feet, the juniper bushes
along the front steps, the wet grass, linda close beside me. we were in
love. nine years old, yes, but it was real love, and now we were alone on
those front steps. finally we looked at each other.

"bye," i said.



linda nodded and said, "bye."

xt few weeks linda wore her new red cap to school every
day.  she  never  took  it  off,  not  even  in  the  classroom,  and  so  it  was
inevitable that she took some teasing about it. most of it came from a kid
named nick veenhof. out on the playground, during recess, nick would
creep up behind her and make a grab for the cap, almost yanking it off,
then scampering away. it went on like that for weeks: the girls giggling,
the guys egging him on. naturally i wanted to do something about it, but
it  just  wasn't

  possible.  i  had  my  reputation  to  think  about.  i  had  my
pride. and there was also the problem of nick veenhof. so i stood off to
the  side,  just  a  spectator,  wishing  i  could  do  things  i  couldn't  do.  i
watched linda clamp down the cap with the palm of her hand, holding it
there, smiling over in nick's direction as if none of it really mattered.

for  me,  though,  it  did  matter.  it  still  does.  i  should've  stepped  in;
fourth  grade  is  no  excuse.  besides,  it  doesn't  get  easier  with  time,  and
twelve years later, when vietnam presented much harder choices, some
practice at being brave might've helped a little.

also, too, i might've stopped what happened next. maybe not, but at

least it's

and so the teacher
nodded  and  told  him  to  hustle  it  up.  which  was  a  mistake.  out  of
nowhere  nick  developed  a  terrible  limp.  he  moved  in  slow  motion,
dragging himself up to the pencil sharpener and carefully slipping in his
pencil  and  then  grinding  away  forever.  at  the  time,  i  suppose,  it  was
funny.  but  on  the  way  back  to  his  seat  nick  took  a  short  detour.  he
squeezed  between  two  desks,  turned  sharply  right,  and  moved  up  the
aisle toward linda.

i saw him grin at one of his pals. in a way, i already knew what was

coming.

as he passed linda's desk, he dropped the pencil and squatted down
to get it. when he came up, his left hand slipped behind her back. there
was  a  half-second  hesitation.  maybe  he  was  trying  to  stop  himself;
maybe then, just briefly, he felt some small approximation of guilt. but it



wasn't  enough.  he  took  hold  of  the  white  tassel,  stood  up,  and  gently
lifted off her cap.

somebody  must've

 laughed.  i  remember  a  short,  tinny  echo.  i
remember  nick  veenhof  trying  to  smile.  somewhere  behind  me,  a  girl
said, "uh," or a sound like that.

linda didn't move.
even now, when i think back on it, i can still see the glossy whiteness
of  her  scalp.  she  wasn't  bald.  not  quite.  not  completely.  there  were
some  tufts  of  hair,  little  patches  of  grayish  brown  fuzz.  but  what  i  saw
then,  and  keep  seeing  now,  is  all  that  whiteness.  a  smooth,  pale,
translucent white. i could see the bones and veins; i could see the exact
structure  of  her  skull.  there  was  a  large  band-aid  at  the  back  of  her
head, a row of

 black stitches, a piece of gauze taped above her left ear.

nick veenhof took a step backward. he was still smiling, but the smile

was doing strange things.

the  whole  time  linda  stared  straight  ahead,  her  eyes  locked  on  the
blackboard, her hands loosely folded at her lap. she didn't say anything.
after  a  time,  though,  she  turned  and  looked  at  me  across  the  room.  it
lasted  only  a  moment,  but  i  had  the  feeling  that  a  whole  conversation
was happening between us. well? she was saying, and i was saying, sure,
okay.

later on, she cried for a while. the teacher helped her put the cap back
on,  then  we  finished  the  spelling  test  and  did

remains
the same. i'm not fooled by the baggy pants or the crew cut or the happy
smile—i  know  my  own  eyes—and  there  is  no  doubt  that  the  timmy
smiling at the camera is the tim i am now. inside the body, or beyond
the body, there is something absolute and unchanging. the human life is
all one thing, like a blade tracing loops on ice: a little kid, a twenty-three-
year-old  infantry  sergeant,  a  middle-aged  writer  knowing  guilt  and
sorrow.

and as a writer now, i want to save linda's life. not her body—her life.



she died, of course. nine years old and she died. it was a brain tumor.
she lived through the summer and into the first part of september, and
then she was dead.

but  in  a  story  i  can  steal  her  soul.  i  can  revive,  at  least  briefly,  that
which  is  absolute  and  unchanging.  in  a  story,  miracles  can  happen.
linda can smile and sit up. she can reach out, touch my wrist, and say,
"timmy, stop crying."

i needed that kind of miracle. at some
 
 ___________________________
 
 point i had come to understand
that linda was sick, maybe even dying, but i loved her and just couldn't
accept it. in the middle of the summer, i remember, my mother tried to
explain  to  me  about  brain  tumors.  now  and  then,  she  said,  bad  things
start growing inside us. sometimes you can cut them out and other times
you can't, and for linda it was one of the times when you can't.

i  thought  about  it  for  several  days.  "all  right,"  i  finally  said.  "so  will

she get better now?"

"well,  no,"  my  mother  said,  "i  don't  think  so."  she  stared  at  a  spot
behind my shoulder. "sometimes people don't ever get better. they die
sometimes."

i shook my head.
"not linda," i said.
but  on  a  september  afternoon,  during  noon  recess,  nick  veenhof
came up to me on the school playground. "your girlfriend," he said, "she

egister.  i  turned
away,  glanced  down  at  my  hands  for  a  second,  then  walked  home
without telling anyone.

it was a little after one o'clock, i remember, and the house was empty.
i  drank  some  chocolate  milk  and  then  lay  down  on  the  sofa  in  the
living room, not really sad, just floating, trying to imagine what it was to
be  dead.  nothing  much  came  to  me.  i  remember  closing  my  eyes  and
whispering  her  name,  almost  begging,  trying  to  make  her  come  back.
"linda,"  i  said,  "please."  and  then  i  concentrated.  i  willed  her  alive.  it
was a dream, i suppose, or a daydream, but i made it happen. i saw her
coming down the middle of main street, all alone. it was nearly dark and



the street was deserted, no cars or people, and linda wore a pink dress
and shiny black shoes. i remember sitting down on the curb to watch. all
her hair had grown back. the scars and stitches were gone. in the dream,
if that's what it was, she was playing a game of some

 sort, laughing and
running up the empty street, kicking a big aluminum water bucket.

right then i started to cry. after a moment linda stopped and carried

her water bucket over to the curb and asked why i was so sad.

"well, god," i said, "you're dead."
linda  nodded  at  me.  she  was  standing  under  a  yellow  streetlight.  a
nine-year-old girl, just a kid, and yet there was something ageless in her
eyes—not a child, not an adult—just a bright ongoing everness, that same
pinprick  of  absolute  lasting  light  that  i  see  today  in  my  own  eyes  as
timmy smiles at tim from the graying photographs of that time.

"dead," i said.
linda smiled. it was a secret smile, as if she knew things nobody could
ever know, and she reached out and touch

into bed and heads for the next hootch."

pausing a moment, rat kiley would grin and shake his head. "honest

to god," he'd murmur. "trick or treat. lemon—there's one class act."

to listen to the story, especially as rat kiley told it, you'd never know
that curt lemon was dead. he was still out there in the dark, naked and
painted up, trick-or-treating, sliding from hootch to hootch in that crazy
white ghost mask. but he was dead.


in september, the day after linda died, i asked my father to take me
down  to  benson's  funeral  home  to  view  the  body.  i  was  a  fifth  grader
then;  i  was  curious.  on  the  drive  downtown  my  father  kept  his  eyes
straight ahead. at one point, i remember, he made a scratchy sound in
his throat. it took him a long time to light up a cigarette.

"timmy," he said, "you're sure about this?"
i nodded at him. down inside, of course, i wasn't sure, and yet i had to
see her one more time. what i needed, i suppose, was s

firmation, something to carry with me after she was gone.



when  we  parked  in  front  of  the  funeral  home,  my  father  turned  and
looked  at  me.  "if  this  bothers  you,"  he  said,  "just  say  the  word.  we'll
make a quick getaway. fair enough?"

"okay," i said.
"or if you start to feel sick or anything—"
"i won't," i told him.
inside,  the  first  thing  i  noticed  was  the  smell,  thick  and  sweet,  like
something sprayed out of a can. the viewing room was empty except for
linda and my father and me. i felt a rush of panic as we walked up the
aisle.  the  smell  made  me  dizzy.  i  tried  to  fight  it  off,  slowing  down  a
little, taking short, shallow breaths through my mouth. but at the same
time  i  felt  a  funny  excitement.  anticipation,  in  a  way—that  same
awkward feeling when i walked up the sidewalk to ring her doorbell on
our  first  date.  i  wanted  to  impress  her.  i  wanted  something  to  happen
between  us,  a  secret  signal  of  some  sort

.  the  room  was  dimly  lighted,
almost  dark,  but  at  the  far  end  of  the  aisle  linda's  white  casket  was
illuminated by a row of spotlights up in the ceiling. everything was quiet.
my  father  put  his  hand  on  my  shoulder,  whispered  something,  and
backed off. after a moment i edged forward a few steps, pushing up on
my toes for a better look.

it  didn't  seem  real.  a  mistake,  i  thought.  the  girl  lying  in  the  white
casket wasn't linda. there was a resemblance, maybe, but where linda
had  always  been  very  slender  and  fragile-looking,  almost  skinny,  the
body  in  that  casket  was  fat  and  swollen.  for  a  second  i  wondered  if
somebody had made a terrible blunder. a technical mistake: like they'd
pumped  her  too  full  of  formaldehyde  or  embalming  fluid  or  whatever
they used. her arms and face were bloated. the skin at her cheeks was
stretched  out  tight  like  the  rubber  skin  on  a  balloon  just  bef

ore  it  pops
open.  even  her  fingers  seemed  puffy.  i  turned  and  glanced  behind  me,
where my father stood, thinking that maybe it was a joke—hoping it was
a joke—almost believing that linda would jump out from behind one of
the curtains and laugh and yell out my name.

but she didn't. the room was silent. when i looked back at the casket,
i felt dizzy again. in my heart, i'm sure, i knew this was linda, but even
so i couldn't find much to recognize. i tried to pretend she was taking a
nap, her hands folded at her stomach, just sleeping away the afternoon.
except  she  didn't  look  asleep.  she  looked  dead.  she  looked  heavy  and
totally dead.



i remember closing my eyes. after a while my father stepped up beside

me.

"come on now," he said. "let's go get some ice cream."



in the months after ted lavender died, there were many other bodies.
i  never  shook  hands—not  that—but

othing was stretched tight like sausage skins, and when
we picked them up, some made sharp burping sounds as the gases were
released.  they  were  heavy.  their  feet  were  bluish  green  and  cold.  the
smell was terrible. at one point mitchell sanders looked at me and said,
"hey, man, i just realized something."

"what?"
he  wiped  his  eyes  and  spoke  very  quietly,  as  if  awed  by  his  own

wisdom.

"death sucks," he said.



lying in bed at night, i made up elaborate stories to bring linda alive
in  my  sleep.  i  invented  my  own  dreams.  it  sounds  impossible,  i  know,
but i did it. i'd picture somebody's birthday party—a crowded room, i'd
think, and a big chocolate cake with pink candles—and then soon i'd be
dreaming  it,  and  after  a  while  linda  would  show  up,  as  i  knew  she



would,  and  in  the  dream  we'd  look  at  each  other  and  not  talk  much,
because  we  were  shy,  but  then  later  i'd  walk  her  home  and  we'd  sit  on
her front steps an

an going to bed earlier and earlier, sometimes even
in  bright  daylight.  my  mother,  i  remember,  finally  asked  about  it  at
breakfast one morning. "timmy, what's wrong?" she said, but all i could
do was shrug and say, "nothing. i just need sleep, that's all." i didn't dare
tell the truth. it was embarrassing, i suppose, but it was also a precious
secret, like a magic trick, where if i tried to explain it, or even talk about
it, the thrill and mystery would be gone. i didn't want to lose linda.

she was dead. i understood that. after all, i'd seen her body, and yet
even  as  a  nine-year-old  i  had  begun  to  practice  the  magic  of  stories.
some i just dreamed up. others i wrote down—the scenes and dialogue.
and at nighttime i'd slide into sleep knowing that linda would be there
waiting  for  me.  once,  i  remember,  we  went  ice  skating  late  at  night,
tracing loops and circles under yellow floodlights. later we sat by a wood
stove in the warming house, all alone, and af
 
 ___________________________
 
ter a while i asked her what
it was like to be dead. apparently linda thought it was a silly question.
she smiled and said, "do i look dead?"

i told her no, she looked terrific. i waited a moment, then asked again,
and linda made a soft little sigh. i could smell our wool mittens drying
on the stove.

for a few seconds she was quiet.
"well, right now," she said, "i'm not dead. but when i am, it's like ... i

don't know, i guess it's like being inside a book that nobody's reading."

"a book?" i said.
"an  old  one.  it's  up  on  a  library  shelf,  so  you're  safe  and  everything,
but the book hasn't been checked out for a long, long time. all you can do
is wait. just hope somebody'll pick it up and start reading

."

linda smiled at me.



"anyhow,  it's  not  so  bad,"  she  said.  "i  mean,  when  you're  dead,  you
just have to be yourself." she stood up and put on her red stocking cap.
"this is stupid. let's go skate some more."

so i followed her down to the frozen pond. it was late, and nobody else
was  there,  and  we  held  hands  and  skated  almost  all  night  under  the
yellow lights.

and then it becomes 1990. i'm forty-three years old, and a writer now,
still  dreaming  linda  alive  in  exactly  the  same  way.  she's  not  the
embodied  linda;  she's  mostly  made  up,  with  a  new  identity  and  a  new
name,  like  the  man  who  never  was.  her  real  name  doesn't  matter.  she
was nine years old. i loved her and then she died. and yet right here, in
the spell of memory and imagination, i can still see her as if through ice,
as if i'm gazing into some other world, a place where there are no brain
tumors and no funeral homes, where there are no bodies at all.

own history, moving fast, riding the melt beneath the blades, doing loops
and  spins,  and  when  i  take  a  high  leap  into  the  dark  and  come  down
thirty years later, i realize it is as tim trying to save timmy's life with a
