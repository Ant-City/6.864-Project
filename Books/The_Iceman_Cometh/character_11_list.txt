Cecil Lewis  - 
      A veteran from the Boer War, Captain Lewis is as "obviously English as Yorkshire pudding." He is in his late fifties, of a lean and erect figure, and sports a war wound on his left shoulder. He dreams of returning to England, having been driven out upon losing his regiment's money in a drunken night of gambling.
