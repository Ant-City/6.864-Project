Gloucester - 
      Named Protector of the English Realm, Gloucester manages the kingdom until Henry is old enough to rule. He and Winchester disagree, and their serving men fight each other in street brawls. Yet Gloucester and Winchester agree to stop fighting, temporarily, over the course of the play.
