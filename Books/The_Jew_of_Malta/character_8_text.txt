     barabas. this shall follow then.
     there have i hid, close underneath the plank
     that runs along the upper-chamber floor,
     the gold and jewels which i kept for thee:--
     but here they come:  be cunning, abigail.

     abigail. then, father, go with me.

     barabas. no, abigail, in this
     it is not necessary i be seen;
     for i will seem offended with thee for't:
     be close, my girl, for this must fetch my gold.

          enter friar jacomo, [47] friar barnardine, abbess, and a nun.

     friar jacomo. sisters,
     we now are almost at the new-made nunnery.

     abbess. [48] the better; for we love not to be seen:
     'tis thirty winters long since some of us
     did stray so far amongst the multitude.

     friar jacomo. but, madam, this house
     and waters of this new-made nunnery
     will much delight you.

     abbess. it may be so.--but who comes here?

          [abigail comes forward.]

     abigail. grave abbess, an

daughter?

     abigail. the hopeless daughter of a hapless jew,
     the jew of malta, wretched barabas,
     sometimes [49] the owner of a goodly house,
     which they have now turn'd to a nunnery.

     abbess. well, daughter, say, what is thy suit with us?

     abigail. fearing the afflictions which my father feels
     proceed from sin or want of faith in us,
     i'd pass away my life in penitence,
     and be a novice in your nunnery,
     to make atonement for my labouring soul.

     friar jacomo. no doubt, brother, but this proceedeth of
     the spirit.

     friar barnardine.
     ay, and of a moving spirit too, brother:  but come,
     let us entreat she may be entertain'd.

     abbess. well, daughter, we admit you for a nun.

     abigail. first let me as a novice learn to frame
     my solitary life to your strait laws,
     and let me lodge where i was wont to lie:
     i do not doubt, by your divine precepts
     and mine own industry, but to profit much.

     barabas. as much

     what mak'st thou 'mongst these hateful christians?

     friar jacomo. hinder her not, thou man of little faith,
     for she has mortified herself.

     barabas. how! mortified!

     friar jacomo. and is admitted to the sisterhood.

     barabas. child of perdition, and thy father's shame!
     what wilt thou do among these hateful fiends?
     i charge thee on my blessing that thou leave
     these devils and their damned heresy!

     abigail. father, forgive me-- [50]

     barabas. nay, back, abigail,
     and think upon the jewels and the gold;
     the board is marked thus that covers it.--
          [aside to abigail in a whisper.]
     away, accursed, from thy father's sight!

     the board is marked thus [51] that covers it--

     friar jacomo. why, abigail, it is not yet long since
     that i did labour thy admission,
     and then thou didst not like that holy life.

     abigail. then were my thoughts so frail and unconfirm'd
     as [104] i

     but now experience, purchased with grief,
     has made me see the difference of things.
     my sinful soul, alas, hath pac'd too long
     the fatal labyrinth of misbelief,
     far from the sun that gives eternal life!

     friar jacomo. who taught thee this?

     abigail. the abbess of the house,
     whose zealous admonition i embrace:
     o, therefore, jacomo, let me be one,
     although unworthy, of that sisterhood!

     friar jacomo. abigail, i will:  but see thou change no more,
     for that will be most heavy to thy soul.

     abigail. that was my father's fault.

     friar jacomo. thy father's! how?

     abigail. nay, you shall pardon me.--o barabas,
     though thou deservest hardly at my hands,
     yet never shall these lips bewray thy life!

     friar barnardine. the abbess sent for me to be confess'd:
     o, what a sad confession will there be!

     convert my father that he may be sav'd,
     and witness that i die a christian!

     and help me to exclaim against the jew.

     friar jacomo. why, what has he done?

     friar barnardine. a thing that makes me tremble to unfold.

     friar jacomo. what, has he crucified a child? [124]

     friar barnardine. no, but a worse thing: 'twas told me in shrift;

     they'll die with grief.

     ithamore. do you not sorrow for your daughter's death?

     barabas. no, but i grieve because she liv'd so long,
     an hebrew born, and would become a christian:
     cazzo, [127] diabolo!
