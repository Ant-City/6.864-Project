of the
houses are slicker and have changed colour. the white doll-house-sized church
above on the rock hillside is neglected, peeling paint and a broken window, the old
priest must be gone. what i mean is dead.
down by the shore, a lot of boats are tied up at the government dock but not many
cars parked: more boats than cars, a bad season. i try to decide which of the cars is
my father’s but as i scan them i realize i no longer know what kind of car he would
be driving.
i reach the turnoff to paul’s, a rough dirt path rutted by tires, crossing the railroad
tracks and continuing through a swamp field, logs laid side by side over the soggy
parts. a few black flies catch up with me, it’s july, past the breeding time, but as
usual there are some left.
the road goes up and i climb it, along the backs of the houses paul built for his
son and his son-in-law and his other son, his clan. paul’s is the original, yellow with
maroon trim, squat farmhouse pattern; though this isn’t farming co

untry, it’s mostly
rock and where there’s any soil it’s thin and sandy. the closest paul ever got to
farming was to have a cow, killed by the milkbottle. the shed where it and the
horses used to live is now a garage.
in the clearing behind the house two 1950s cars are resting, a pink one and a red
one, raised on wooden blocks, no wheels; scattered around them are the rusting
remains of older cars: like my father, paul saves everything useful. the house has
added a pointed structure like a church spire, made of former car parts welded
together; on top of it is a t.v. antenna and on top of that a lightning rod.
paul is at home, he’s in the vegetable garden at the side of the house. he
straightens up to watch me, his face leathery and retained as ever, like a closed
suitcase; i don’t think he knows who i am.
“bonjour monsieur,” i say when i’m at the fence. he takes a step towards me, still
guarding, a

nd i say “don’t you remember me,” and smile. again the strangling
feeling, paralysis of the throat; but paul speaks english, he’s been outside. “it was
very kind of you to write.”
“ah,” he says, not recognizing me but deducing who i must be, “bonjour,” and
then he smiles too. he clasps his hands in front of him like a priest or a porcelain
mandarin; he doesn’t say anything else. we stand there on either side of the fence,
our faces petrified in well-intentioned curves, mouths wreathed in parentheses, until
i say “has he come back yet?”
at this his chin plummets, his head teeters on

 his neck. “ah. no.” he gazes
sideways, accusingly, down at a potato plant near his left foot. then his head jerks
up again and he says gaily, “not yet, ay? but maybe soon. your fadder, he knows the
bush.”
madame has appeared in the kitchen doorway and paul speaks with her in the
nasal slanted french i can’t interpret because i learned all but a few early words of
mine in school. folk songs and christmas carols and, from the later grades,
memorized passages of racine and baudelaire are no help to me here.
“you must come in,” he says to me, “and take a tea,” and he bends and undoes the
hook of the wooden gate. i go forward to the door where madame is waiting for
me, hands outstretched in welcome, smiling and shaking her head mournfully as

emained loyal to her wood range. we sit on the
screened porch overlooking the lake, balancing our teacups and rocking side by
side in three rocking chairs; i’ve been given the store cushion, which has an
embroidered view of niagara falls. the black and white collie, either the identical
one i used to be afraid of or its offshoot, lies on the braided rug by our feet.
madame, who is the same thickness all the way down, is in a long-skirted dress
and black stockings and a print apron with a bib, paul in high-waisted trousers with
braces, flannel shirt-sleeves rolled. i’m annoyed with them for looking so much like
carvings, the habitant kind they sell in tourist handicraft shops; but of course it’s the
other way around, it’s the carvings that look like them. i wonder what they think i
look like, they may find my jeans and sweatshirt and fringed over-the-shoulder bag
strange, perhaps immoral, though such things may be more common in the village
since the tourists and the t.v.; besides,

i can be forgiven because my family was, by

i lift my cup, they are watching me anxiously: it’s imperative that i mention the
tea. “très bon,” i manage to get out in the direction of madame. “délicieux.” doubt
seizes me, thé may be feminine.
what i’m remembering are the visits our mother was obliged to pay madame
while our father was visiting paul. my father and paul would be outside, talking
about boats or motors or forest fires or one of their expeditions, and my mother
and madame would be inside in the rocking chairs (my mother with the niagara
falls cushion), trying with great goodwill to make conversation. neither knew more
than five words of the other’s language and after the opening bonjours both would
unconsciously raise their voices as though talking to a deaf person.
“il fait beau,” my mother would shout, no matter what the weather was like,

n? ah, il fait beau, oui, il fait beau,
ban oui.” when she had ground to a stop both would think desperately, chairs
rocking.
“ ’ow are you?” madame would scream, and my mother, after deciphering this,
would say “fine, i am fine.” then she would repeat the question: “how are you,
madame?” but madame would not have the answer and both, still smiling, would
glance furtively out through the screen to see if the men were yet coming to rescue
them.
meanwhile my father would be giving paul the cabbages or the string beans he
had brought from his garden and paul would be replying with tomatoes or lettuces
from his. since their gardens had the same things in them this exchange of
vegetables was purely ritual: after it had taken place we would know the visit would
be officially over.
madame is stirring her tea now and sighing. she says something to paul and paul
says, “your mother, she was a good woman, madame says it is very sad; so young
too.”
“yes,” i say. mother and mada

her the spring had been late or early, whether it had
been a wet summer. it made me angry to see it in that windowless room where it was
no use; i waited till her eyes were closed and slipped it into my shoulder bag. when
i got outside i leafed through it, i thought there might be something about me, but
except for the dates the pages were blank, she had given up months ago.
“do what you think best,” she said from behind her closed eyes. “is there snow?”
we rock some more. i want to ask paul about my father but he ought to begin, he
must have news to tell me. maybe he’s avoiding it; or maybe he’s being tactful,
waiting until i’m ready. finally i say “what happened to him?”
paul shrugs. “he is just gone,” he says. “i go there one day to see him, the door is
open, the boats is there, i think maybe he is off somewheres near and i wait awhile.
next day i go back, everything the same, i begin to worry, where he is, i don’t know.

his car she is here, with me.” he gestures towards the back, the garage. my father
trusted paul, he said paul could build anything and fix anything. they were once
caught in a three-week rainstorm, my father said if you could spend three weeks in a
wet tent with a man without killing him or having him kill you then he was a good
man. paul justified for him his own ideal of the simple life; but for paul the
anachronism was imposed, he’d never chosen it.
“did you look on the island?” i say. “if the boats are there he can’t have gone off
the island.”
“i look, sure,” paul says, “i tell the police from down-the-road, they look around,
nobody find nothing. your husband here too?” he asks irrelevantly.
“yes, he’s here,” i say, skipping over the lie even in my own mind. what he means
is that a man should be handling this; joe will do as a stand-in. my status is a

never threw it out, it’s useful for landladies. i sent my parents a postcard after the
wedding, they must have mentioned it to paul; that, but not the divorce. it isn’t part
of the vocabulary here, there’s no reason to upset them.
i’m waiting for madame to ask about the baby, i’m prepared, alerted, i’ll tell her i
left him in the city; that would be perfectly true, only it was a different city, he’s
better off with my husband, former husband.

marking the site where a building once stood in which an event of little importance

to get rid of, easier and easier. i don’t have time for him, i switch problems.
i sip at my tea and rock, by my feet the dog stirs, the lake below flutters in the
wind which is beginning. my father has simply disappeared then, vanished into
nothing. when i got paul’s letter – “your father is gone, nobody cant find him” – it
seemed incredible, but it appears to be true.
there used to be a barometer on the porch wall, a wooden house with two doors
and a man and a woman who lived inside. when it was going to be fair the woman
in her long skirt and apron would emerge from her door, when it was going to rain
she would go in and the man would come out, carrying an axe. when it was first
explained to me i thought they controlled the weather instead of

to it. my eyes seek the house now, i need a prediction, but it’s not there.
“i think i’ll go down the lake,” i say.
paul raises his hands, palms outward. “we look two, three times already.”
but they must have missed something, i feel it will be different if i look myself.
probably when we get there my father will have returned from wherever he has
been, he will be sitting in the cabin waiting for us.

“oh god,” anna says, “david thinks he’s a great white hunter.” she’s teasing him,
she does that a lot; but he doesn’t hear, he’s getting up, claude is hustling him off to
make him out a licence, it seems claude is in charge of the licences. when david
comes back i want to ask how much he paid, but he’s too pleased, i don’t want to
spoil it. claude is pleased also.
we find out from claude we can hire evans, who owns the blue moon cabins, to
run us down the lake. paul would take us for nothing, he offered, but i wouldn’t feel
right about it; also i’m sure he would misinterpret joe’s amorphous beard and
david’s moustache and three musketeers hair. they’re just a style now, like crew
cuts, but paul might feel they are dangerous, they mean riots.
david eases the car down the turnoff, two ruts and a rock hump in the centre that
scrapes the car’s belly. we brake in front of the cabin marked office; evans is there, a

staccato alarm-clock cry; they nest in the cliff, burrowing into the sand, it speeds up
the erosion.
in front of the house the chicken-wire fence is still here, though one end is almost
over the brink. they never dismantled it; even the dwarf swing is there, ropes
frayed, sagging and blotched with weather. it wasn’t like them to keep something
when it was no longer needed; perhaps they expected grandchildren, visiting here.
he would have wanted a dynasty, like paul’s, houses and descendants proliferating
around him. the fence is a reproach, it points to my failure.
but i couldn’t have brought the child here, i never identified it as mine; i didn’t
name it before it was born even, the way you’re supposed to. it was my husband’s,
he imposed it on me, all the time it was growing in me i felt like an incubator. he
measured everything he would let me eat, he was feeding it on me, he wanted a
replica of himself; after it was born i was no more use. i

 it though,
he was clever: he kept saying he loved me.
the house is smaller, because (i realize) the trees around it have grown. it’s
turned greyer in nine years too, like hair. the cedar logs are upright instead of
horizontal, upright logs are shorter and easier for one man to handle. cedar isn’t
the best wood, it decays quickly. once my father said “i didn’t build it to last
forever” and i thought then, why not? why didn’t you?
i hope the door will be open but it’s padlocked, as paul said he left it. i dig the
keys he gave me out of my bag and approach warily: whatever i find inside will be a
clue. what if he returned after paul locked it and couldn’t get in? but there are other
ways of getting in, he could have broken a window.
joe and david are here now with the other packsacks and the beer. anna is behind
them with my case and the paper bag; she’s singing again, mockingbird hill.

forehead, i can see her hand moving back and forth. they’ve been
married nine years, anna told me, they must have got married about the same time i
did; but she’s older than i am. they must have some special method, formula, some
knowledge i missed out on; or maybe he was the wrong person. i thought it would
happen without my doing anything about it, i’d turn into part of a couple, two people
linked together and balancing each other, like the wooden man and woman in the
barometer house at paul’s. it was good at first but he changed after i married him, he
married me, we committed that paper act. i still don’t see why signing a name
should make any difference but he began to expect things, he wanted to be pleased.
we should have kept sleeping together and left it at that.
joe puts his arm around me, i take hold of his fingers. what i’m seeing is the
black and white tugboat that used to be on the lake, or was it flat like a barge, it
towed the log booms slowly down towards the da

the trail dips down and across a swamp inlet at the tip of a bay, cedars here and
bullrushes, blueflags, ooze. i go slowly, looking for footprints. there’s nothing but
a deer track, no sign of anyone: apparently paul and the searchers didn’t make it this
far. the mosquitoes have scented us and swarm around our heads; joe swears
gently, david loudly, at the end of the line i hear anna slapping.

but the truth is that i don’t know what the villagers thought or talked about, i was
so shut off from them. the older ones occasionally crossed themselves when we
passed, possibly because my mother was wearing slacks, but even that was never
explained. although we played during visits with the solemn, slightly hostile
children of paul and madame, the games were brief and wordless. we never could
find out what went on inside the tiny hillside church they filed into on sundays: our
parents wouldn’t let us sneak up and peer through the windows, which made it illicit
and attractive. after my brother began going to school in the winters he told me it
was called the mass and what they did inside was eat; i imagined it as a sort of
birthday party, with ice cream – birthday parties were my only experience then of
people eating i

ith hoarse cries. i stood quietly with my hand outstretched but they wouldn’t fly
down; they winged overhead, reconnoitring. perhaps i was moving without
knowing it, you had to convince them you were a thing, not an enemy. our mother
made us watch from inside the house, she said we frightened them. once people
believed the flight of birds was a portent: augury.
i heard the mosquito whine of a motor approaching; i left my handful of crumbs
on the tray and went out on the point to watch. it was paul’s boat, white-painted and
squarish, handmade; he waved to me from the stern. there was another man with
him, sitting in the bow, backwards.
they pulled in to the dock and i ran down the steps to greet them; i caught the
rope and tied it. “careful,” i said as they stepped out, “it’s rotten in places.”
paul had brought me a huge wad of vegetables from his garden: he handed me a
bouquet of swiss chard, a quart basket of green beans, a bundle of carrots, a brainsized
cauliflower, bashfu

 hand shot towards
me. i transferred the swiss chard to the crook of my arm and took the hand, which
squeezed mine confidentially. “bill malmstrom, please call me bill.” he had
trimmed grey hair and an executive moustache like the shirt ads, the vodka ads; his
clothes were woodsy, semi-worn, verging on the authentic. slung around his neck
was a pair of binoculars in a suede case.
we walked to the land; he had taken out a pipe and was lighting it. i wondered if
he was from the government. “paul, here, was telling me,” he said, looking around
for paul, “what a nice place you have.”
“it’s my father’s,” i said.
his face drooped into the appropriate downward curve; if he’d been wearing a hat
he would have taken it off. “ah yes,” he said, “a tragedy.” i distrusted him: i couldn’t
place the accent, the name sounded german.
“where are you from?” i asked, trying to be polite.
“michigan,” he said as though it was something to be proud of. “i’m a member of

with lawyers; i would have to sign forms or charters, i might have to pay death

indefinitely, you might say.” he drew out his wallet and gave me a card: bill
malmstrom, teenie town, it said, togs for toddlers ’n tots.
“thank you,” i said, “i’ll keep it in mind.”
i took paul by the arm and led him to the garden, as though to reciprocate for the
vegetables: i felt i had to explain, at least to him, he had gone to a lot of trouble for
me.
“your garden, she is not doing so good, ay?” he said, inspecting.
“no,” i said, “we just got it weeded; but i want you to have …” i gazed
desperately around, seized on a withered lettuce and presented it to him, roots and
all, as gracefully as i could.
he held it, blinking, discouraged. “madame will like that,” he

said.
“paul,” i said, lowering my voice, “the reason i can’t sell is that my father’s still
alive.”
“yes?” he said, perking up. “he came back, he is here?”
“not exactly,” i said. “he’s away right now, on a sort of trip; but perhaps he will
be here soon.” for all i could tell he might have been listening to us at that moment,
from behind the raspberry canes or the burn heap.
“he went for the trees?” paul said, hurt that he hadn’t been consulted: he used to
go too. “you saw him first, before?”
“no,” i said, “he was gone when i got here; but he left me a note, more or less.”
“ah,” he said, glancing nervously over my shoulder into the forest. it was clear
he didn’t believe me.
for lunch we had paul’s cauliflower and some tins, corn and fried ham. during
the canned pears david said “who were those two old guys?” he must have seen
them from the window.
“it was a man who w

s,” david said, “maybe he has worms; when you get back to
the city you should take him to the vet.” and a moment later, “how come you never
laugh at my jokes?”
he hung around while i set out the brushes and paper. finally he said, “well,
nature calls,” and soft-shoed out the door like the end of a vaudeville act.
i swivelled the caps back onto the paint tubes, i had no intention of working: now
they were all out of the way i would search for the will, the deed, the property title.
paul had been certain he was dead, that made me doubt my theory. perhaps the c.i.a.
had done away with him to get the land, mr. malmstrom was not quite plausible; but
that was preposterous, i couldn’t start suspecting people for no reason.
i rummaged in the cavity under the wall bench, went through the shelves, groped
under the beds where the tents were stored. he might have filed the papers in a
safety-deposit box, earlier, in a city bank, i’d never find them. or he might have
burned them. at a

grandmothers and grandfathers first, distant ancestors, strangers, in face-front
firing-squad poses: cameras weren’t ordinary then, maybe they thought their souls
were being stolen, as the indians did. underneath them were labels in white, my
mother’s cautious printing. my mother before she was married, another stranger,
with bobbed hair and a knitted hat. wedding pictures, corseted smiles. my brother
before i was born, then pictures of me beginning to appear. paul taking us down the
lake with his sleigh and horses before the ice went out. my mother, in her leather
jacket and odd long 1940s hair, standing beside the tray for the birds, her hand
stretched out; the jays were there too, she’s training them, one is on her shoulder,
peering at her with clever thumbtack eyes, another is landing on her wrist, wings
caught as a blur. sun sifting around her through the pines, her looking straight at the
camera, frightened, receding into the shadows of her head l

studying for the ministry, nobody knew any better then. but that’s life.” he wiggled
his moustache and gave a woody woodpecker laugh, his eyes baffled.
“i think you could work it out,” i said. i braced the paddle across the gunwales and
clambered into the canoe. i remembered what anna had said about emotional
commitments: they’ve made one, i thought, they hate each other; that must be almost
as absorbing as love. the barometer couple in their wooden house, enshrined in
their niche on paul’s front porch, my ideal; except they were glued there,
condemned to oscillate back and forth, sun and rain, without escape. when he saw
her next there would be no recantations, no elaborate reconciliation or forgiveness,
they were beyond that. neither of them would mention it, they had reached a balance
almost like peace. our mother and father at the sawhorse behind the cabin, mother
holding the tree, white birch, father sawing, sun through the branches lighting their
hair, grace.

they used to, to see if we had any dead fish and a licence to go
with them; it was routine.
the launch slowed and drew into the dock. david was down there anyway, i
would let him meet it, he was the one with the papers. i re-entered the house and
stood by the window. anna, inquisitive, sauntered down to join them.
there were two men, police or probably game wardens, they were wearing
ordinary clothes; and a third man, blond, claude from the village probably, and a
fourth one, older, the size of paul. it was odd that paul was on the launch: if he were
coming for a visit he would bring his own boat. david shook hands with them and
they clustered on the dock, talking in low voices. david dug into his pocket, for the
licence; then he scratched his neck as if worried. joe appeared from the outhouse
path and the talking started over again; anna’s head turned up towards me.
then i saw david hurrying, taking the hill steps two at a time. the screen door
banged shut behind him. “they found your

the door slammed again, it was anna; he put his arm around her and they both
studied me with the intent pouncing look they’d had at supper.
“oh,” i said. “where?”
“some american guys found him in the lake. they were fishing, they hooked him
by mistake; the body was unrecognizable but an old guy named paul something-orother
down there, says he knows you, he identified the clothes. they figured he’d
fallen off a cliff or something, he had a skull fracture.” seedy department-store
magician, producing my father out of nowhere like a stuffed rabbit out of a hat.
“where?” i said again.
“it’s awful,” anna said, “i’m really sorry.”
“they don’t know where it happened,” david said, “he must’ve drifted; he had a
camera around his neck, big one, they think the weight kept him d

time: i knew it was a lie, he was doing it to get back at me. “did they ask to see your
fishing licence?” i said.
“no,” he said, faking surprise. “you want to talk to them?”
that was a risk, he should have calculated better, it would expose his whole false
construction. maybe that’s what he wanted, maybe it was intended as a practical joke.
i decided to act as though i believed him, see how he’d get out of it. “no,” i said,
“tell them i’m too upset. i’ll speak to paul tomorrow when we get to the village,
about the arrangements.” that was what they were called, the arrangements. “he’d
want to be buried around here.” convincing details, if he could invent i could invent
also, i’d read enough murder mysteries. the detectives, eccentric hermits, orchidraisers,
sharp blue-haired old ladies, girls with jackknives and flashlights, for them
everything fitted. but not in real life, i wanted to tell him, you’ve outsmarted
yourself.
he and anna glanced at e

undergoing its watery changes. word furrows potential already in its proto-brain,
untravelled paths. no god and perhaps not real, even that is uncertain; i can’t know
yet, it’s too early. but i assume it: if i die it dies, if i starve it starves with me. it
might be the first one, the first true human; it must be born, allowed.
i’m outside in the garden when the boat comes. it isn’t evans; it’s paul’s boat,
thick and slow and painted white, he built it himself. paul is at the back, beside the
antique motor; in the front is joe.
i go out through the gate and retreat behind the trees, white birches clumped
beside the path, not hurrying, not running away but cautious.
the motor cuts, the nose of the boat bumps the dock. paul stands up with an oar,
pulling in; joe gets out and ropes the boat and takes several steps towards the land.
he calls my name, then pauses, “are you here?” echo: he
