[CHARACTER]  - 
                the
principal secretary of private affairs in lilliput, who explains
to gulliver the history of the political tensions between the two
principal parties in the realm, the high-heels and the low-heels.
[CHARACTER] is more a source of much-needed information for gulliver
than a well-developed personality, but he does display personal
courage and trust in allowing gulliver to hold him in his palm while
he talks politics. within the convoluted context of lilliput's factions
and conspiracies, such friendliness reminds us that fond personal
relations may still exist even in this overheated political climate.
