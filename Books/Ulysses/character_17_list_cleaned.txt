                 headmaster
of the boys' school where stephen teaches. deasy is a protestant
from the north of ireland, and he is respectful of the english government.
deasy is condescending to stephen and not a good listener. his overwrought
letter to the editor about foot-and-mouth disease among cattle is
the object of mockery among dublin men for the rest of the day.
