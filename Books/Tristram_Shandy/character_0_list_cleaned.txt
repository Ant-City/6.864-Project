[CHARACTER]  - 
      tristram is both the fictionalized author of the life and opinions of [CHARACTER] and the child whose conception, birth, christening, and circumcision form one major sequence of the narrative. the adult [CHARACTER] relates certain aspects of his family history, including many that took place before his own birth, drawing from stories and hearsay as much as from his own memories. his opinions we get in abundance; of the actual details of his life the author furnishes only traces, and the child tristram turns out to be a minor character.
