Somerset - 
      Somerset and York first disagreed in 1 Henry VI over a point of law, causing all their followers to align themselves behind one or the other through wearing the emblem of the white or red rose. Somerset stood for the red rose. He still hates York, but he also schemes against Gloucester in this play.
