Sir John Falstaff - 
 The closest friend and mentor of the young Henry,
back in his wild days. Falstaff doesn't actually appear in Henry
V, but he is a major figure in the Henry IV plays. He is a jovial
and frequently drunken old knight, but his heart is broken when
Henry breaks his ties with him after becoming king. We hear news
of Falstaff's offstage death in Act II, scenes i and iii.
