Edgar - 
                Gloucester's
older, legitimate son. Edgar plays many different roles, starting
out as a gullible fool easily tricked by his brother, then assuming
a disguise as a mad beggar to evade his father's men, then carrying
his impersonation further to aid Lear and Gloucester, and finally
appearing as an armored champion to avenge his brother's treason.
Edgar's propensity for disguises and impersonations makes it difficult
to characterize him effectively.
