        he was right; but it was hard to give him up. "go," said i, "and break your mother's heart."

        i repented of my words ere they were out.

        "linda," said he, speaking as i had not heard him speak that evening, "how could you say that? poor mother! be kind to her, linda; and you, too, cousin fanny."

        cousin fanny was a friend who had lived some years with us.

        farewells were exchanged, and the bright, kind boy, endeared to us by so many acts of love, vanished from our sight.

        it is not necessary to state how he made his escape. suffice it to say, he was on his way to new york when a violent storm overtook the vessel. the captain said he must put into the nearest port. this alarmed benjamin, who was aware that he would be advertised in every port near his own town.

        when i had been working a month at the plantation, the great aunt of mr. flint came to make him a visit. this was the good old lady who paid fifty dollars for my grandmother, for the purpose of making her free, when she stood on the auction block. my grandmother loved this old lady, whom we all called miss fanny. she often came to take tea with us. on such occasions the table was spread with a snow-white cloth, and the china cups and silver spoons were taken from the old-fashioned buffet. there were hot muffins, tea rusks, and delicious sweetmeats. my grandmother kept two cows, and the fresh cream was miss fanny's delight. she invariably declared that it was the best in town. the old ladies had cosey times together. they would work and chat, and sometimes, while talking over old times, their spectacles

        there had been a time when dr. flint's wife came to take tea with us, and when her children were also sent to have a feast of "aunt marthy's" nice cooking. but after i became an object of her jealousy and spite, she was angry with grandmother for giving a shelter to me and my children. she would not even speak to her in the street. this wounded my grandmother's feelings, for she cou

        miss fanny was endeared to me by many recollections, and i was rejoiced to see her at the plantation. the warmth of her large, loyal heart made the house seem pleasanter while she was in it. she staid a week, and i had many talks with her. she said her principal object in coming was to see how i was treated, and whether any thing could be done for me. she inquired whether she could help me in any way. i told her i believed not. she condoled with me in her own peculiar way; saying she wished that i and all

might reckon years of suffering during that festival so joyous to the free. on the new year's day preceding my aunt's death, one of my friends, named fanny, was to be sold at auction to pay her master's debts. my thoughts were with her during all the day, and at night i anxiously inquired what had been her fate. i was told that she had been sold to one master, and her four little girls to another master, far distant; that she had escaped from her purchaser, and was not to be found. her mother was the old aggie i have spoken of. she lived in a small tenement belonging to my grandmother, and built on the same lot with her own house. her dwelling was

        when my friend peter was apprised of this, he was disappointed and vexed. he said, that judging from our past experience, it would be a long time before i has such another chance to throw away. i told him it need not be thrown away; that i had a friend concealed near by, who would be glad enough to take to the place that had been provided for me. i told him about poor fanny, and the kind-hearted, noble fellow, who never turned his back upon any body in distress, white or black, expressed his readiness to help her. aggie was much surprised when she found that we knew her secret. she was rejoiced to hear of such a chance for fanny,

        the next morning i peeped through my loophole, and saw that it was dark and cloudy. at night i received news that the wind was ahead, and the vessel had not sailed. i was exceedingly anxious about fanny, and peter too, who was running a tremendous risk at my instigation. next day the wind and weather remained the same. poor fanny had been half dead with fright when they carried her on board, and i could readily imagine how she must be suffering now. grandmother came often to my den, to say how thankful she was i did not go. on the third morning she rapped for me to come down to the storeroom. the poor old sufferer was breaking down under her weight of trouble. she was easily flurried now. i fo

"poor child!" she exclaimed, "my carelessness has ruined you. the boat ain't gone yet. get ready immediately, and go with fanny. i ain't got another word to say against it now; for there's no telling what may happen this day."

        uncle phillip was sent for, and he agreed with his mother in thinking that jenny would inform dr. flint

        "what's her name?" inquired the captain.

        "linda," he replied.

        "that's the the name of the woman already here," rejoined the captain. "by george! i believe you mean to betray me."

        "o!" exclaimed peter, "god knows i wouldn't harm a hair of your head. i am too grateful to you. but there really is another woman in great danger. do have the humanity to stop and take her!"

        after a while they came to an understanding. fanny, not dreaming i was any where about in that region, had assumed my name, though she called herself johnson. "linda is a common name," said peter, "and the woman i want to bring is linda brent."

        the captain agreed to wait at a certain place till evening, being handsomely paid for his detention.

        of course, the day was an anxious one for us all. but we concluded that if jenny had seen me, she would be too wise to let her mistress know of it; and that she probably would not get a

but i had presence of mind to think that it probably referred to something the captain had told him; so i thanked him, and said i hoped we should have pleasant weather.

        when i entered the vessel the captain came forward to meet me. he was an elderly man, with a pleasant countenance. he showed me to a little box of a cabin, where sat my friend fanny. she started as if she had seen a spectre. she gazed on me in utter astonishment, and exclaimed, "linda, can this be you? or is it your ghost?" when we were locked in each other's arms, my overwrought feelings could no longer be restrained. my sobs reached the ears of the captain, who came and very kindly reminded us, that for his safety, as well as our own, it would be prudent for us not to attract any attention. he said that when there was a sail in sight he wished us to keep below; but at ot

        fanny and i now talked by ourselves, low and quietly, in our little cabin. she told me of the sufferings she had gone through in making her escape, and of her terrors while she was concealed in her mother's house. above all, she dwelt on the agony of separation from all her children on that dreadful auction day. she could scarcely credit me, when i told her of the place where i had passed nearly seven years.

        the captain soon came to advise us to go on deck for fresh air. his friendly and respectful manner, combined with fanny's testimony, reassured me, and we went with him. he placed us in a comfortable seat, and occasionally entered into conversations. he told us he w

        he saw that i was suspicious, and he said he was sorry, now that he had brought us to the end of our voyage, to find i had so little confidence in him. ah, if he had ever been a slave he would have known how difficult it was to trust a white man. he assured us that we might sleep through the night without fear; that he would take care we were not left unprotected. be it said to the honor of this captain, southerner as he was, that if fanny and i had been white ladies, and our passage lawfully engaged, he could not have treated us more respectfully. my intelligent friend, peter, had rightly estimated the character of the man to whose honor he had intrusted us.

e. i overcame my dread of encountering strangers, and went with her. many questions were asked concerning my experiences, and my escape from slavery; but i observed how careful they all were not to say any thing that might wound my feelings. how gratifying this was, can be fully understood only by those who have been accustomed to be treated as if they were not included within the pale of human beings. the anti-slavery friend had come to inquire into my plans, and to offer assistance, if needed. fanny was comfortably established, for the present, with a friend of mr. durham. the anti-slavery society agreed to pay her expenses to new york. the same was offered to me but i declined to accept it; telling them that my grandmother had given me sufficient to pay my expenses to the end of my journey. we were urged to remain in philadelphia a few days, until some suitable escort could be found for us. i gladly accepted the proposition,

        i went to see fanny, and found her so well contented among her new friends that she was in no haste to leave. i was also very happy with my kind hostess. she had had advantages for education, and was vastly my superior. every day, almost every hour, i was adding to my little stock of knowledge. she took me out to see the city as much as she deemed prudent. one day she took me to an artist's room, and showed me the portraits of some of her children. i had never seen any paintings of colored people before, and they

        i said, "but, my child, i want you to know about your father."

        "i know all about it, mother," she replied; "i am nothing to my father, and he is nothing to me. all my love is for you. i was with him five months in washington, and he never cared for me. he never spoke to me as he did to his little fanny. i knew all the time he was my father, for fanny's nurse told me so; but she said i must never tell any body, and i never did. i used to wish he would take me in his arms and kiss me, as he did fanny; or that he would sometimes smile at me, as he did at her. i thought if he was my own father, he ought to love me. i was a little girl then, and didn't know any better. but now i never think any thing about my father. all my love is for you." she hugged me closer as she spoke, and i thanked god tha
