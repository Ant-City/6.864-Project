uld  actually  get
away with it, no officers or anything, nobody to clamp down, then they
dropped the subject and moved on to cars and baseball.

later  in  the  night,  though,  a  young  medic  named  mark  fossie  kept

coming back to the subject.



"look,  if  you  think  about  it,"  he  said,  "it's  not  that  crazy.  you  could

actually do it."

"do what?" rat said.
"you know. bring in a girl. i mean, what's the problem?"
rat shrugged. "nothing. a war."
"well, see, that's the thing," mark fossie said. "no war here. you could

really do it. a pair of solid brass balls, that's all you'd need."

there was some laughter, and eddie diamond told him he'd best strap
down  his  dick,  but  fossie  just  frowned  and  looked  at  the  ceiling  for  a
while and then went off to write a letter.

six weeks later his girlfriend showed up.
the  way  rat  told  it,  she  came  in  by  helicopter  along  with  the  daily
resupply shipment out of chu lai. a tall, big-boned blonde. at best, rat
said, sh

high.  she  had  long  white  legs  and  blue  eyes  and  a  complexion  like
strawberry ice cream. very friendly, too.

at  the  helipad  that  morning,  mark  fossie  grinned  and  put  his  arm

around her and said, "guys, this is mary anne."

the girl seemed tired and somewhat lost, but she smiled.
there was a heavy silence. eddie diamond, the ranking nco, made a
small motion with his hand, and some of the others murmured a word or
two, then they watched mark fossie pick up her suitcase and lead her by
the arm down to the hootches. for a long while the men were quiet.

"that fucker," somebody finally said.
at  evening  chow  mark  fossie  explained  how  he'd  set  it  up.  it  was
expensive, he admitted, and the logistics were complicated, but it wasn't
like  going  to  the  moon.  cleveland  to  los  angeles,  la  to  bangkok,

"a cinch," fossie said, and gazed down at his pretty girlfriend. "thing

is, you just got to want it enough."

mary anne bell and mark fossie had been sweethearts since grammar
school. from the sixth grade on they had known for a fact that someday
they  would  be  married,  and  live  in  a  fine  gingerbread  house  near  lake
erie,  and  have  three  healthy  yellow-haired  children,  and  grow  old



together,  and  no  doubt  die  in  each  other's  arms  and  be  buried  in  the
same walnut casket. that was the plan. they were very much in love, full
of  dreams,  and  in  the  ordinary  flow  of  their  lives  the  whole  scen

rl.  too  wide  in  the  shoulders,  maybe,  but  she  had  terrific
legs, a bubbly personality, a happy smile. the men genuinely liked her.
out  on  the  volleyball  court  she  wore  cut-off  blue  jeans  and  a  black
swimsuit top, which the guys appreciated, and in the evenings she liked
to dance to music from rat's portable tape deck. there was a novelty to
it; she was good for morale. at times she gave off a kind of come-get-me
energy, coy and flirtatious, but apparently it never bothered mark fossie.
in  fact  he  seemed  to  enjoy  it,  just  grinning  at  her,  because  he  was  so
much  in  love,  and  because  it  was  the  sort  of  show  that  a  girl  will
sometimes put on for her boyfriend's entertainment and education.

though she was young, rat said, mary anne bell was no timid child.
she was curious about things. during her first days in-country she liked
to roam around the compound asking questions: what exactly was a trip
flare?  how  did  a  claymore  work?  what  was  behind

an  m-16,  how  the  various  parts  worked,  and
from  there  it  was  a  natural  progression  to  learning  how  to  use  the
weapon.  for  hours  at  a  time  she  plunked  away  at  c-ration  cans,  a  bit
unsure of herself, but as it turned out she had a real knack for it. there
was a new confidence in her voice, a new authority in the way she carried
herself. in many ways she remained naive and immature, still a kid, but
cleveland heights now seemed very far away.

once or twice, gently, mark fossie suggested that it might be time to
think  about  heading  home,  but  mary  anne  laughed  and  told  him  to
forget it. "everything i want," she said, "is right here."

she stroked his arm, and then kissed him.



on  one  level  things  remained  the  same  between  them.  they  slept
together.  they  held  hands  and  made  plans  for  after  the  war.  but  now
there  was  a  new  imprecision  in  the  way  mary  anne  expressed  her
thoughts  on  certain  subjects.  not  necessarily  thre

e  kids,  she'd  say.  not
necessarily a house on lake erie. "naturally we'll still get married," she'd
tell him, "but it doesn't have to be right away. maybe travel first. maybe
live together. just test it out, you know?"

mark fossie would nod at this, even smile and agree, but it made him
uncomfortable.  he  couldn't  pin  it  down.  her  body  seemed  foreign
somehow—too stiff in places, too firm where the softness used to be. the
bubbliness was gone. the nervous giggling, too. when she laughed now,
which  was  rare,  it  was  only  when  something  struck  her  as  truly  funny.
her  voice  seemed  to  reorganize  itself  at  a  lower  pitch.  in  the  evenings,
while  the  men  played  cards,  she  would  sometimes  f

ly. i mean, in a way
she  was  sleeping  with all  of  them,  more  or  less,  except  it  wasn't  sex  or
anything. they was just lying together, so to speak, mary anne and these
six grungy weirded-out green berets."

"lying down?" sanders said.
"you got it."
"lying down how?"
rat smiled. "ambush. all night long, man, mary anne's out on fuckin'

ambush."


just  after  sunrise,  rat  said,  she  came  trooping  in  through  the  wire,
tired-looking but cheerful as she dropped her gear and gave mark fossie
a brisk hug. the six green berets did not speak. one of them nodded at
her,  and  the  others  gave  fossie  a  long  stare,  then  they  filed  off  to  their
hootch at the edge of the compound.

"please," she said. "not a word."
fossie took a half step forward and hesitated. it was as though he had
trouble  recognizing  her.  she  wore  a  bush  hat  and  filthy  green  fatigues;
she carried the standard m-16 automatic assault rifle; her face was black
with charcoal.

mary anne handed him the

eyes down, poking at her food, subdued to the point of silence. eddie
diamond  and  some  of  the  others  tried  to  nudge  her  into  talking  about
the  ambush—what  was  the  feeling  out  there?  what  exactly  did  she  see
and  hear?—but  the  questions  seemed  to  give  her  trouble.  nervously,
she'd look across the table at fossie. she'd wait a moment, as if to receive
some sort of clearance, then she'd bow her head and mumble out a vague
word or two. there were no real answers.

mark fossie, too, had little to say.
"nobody's  business,"  he  told  rat  that  night.  then  he  offered  a  brief
smile. "one thing for sure, though, there won't be any more ambushes.
no more late nights."

"you laid down the law?"
"compromise,"  fossie  said.  "i'll  put  it  this  way—we're  officially

engaged."

rat nodded cautiously.
"well hey, she'll make a sweet bride," he said. "combat ready."



over the next several days there was a strained, tightly wound quality
to the way they treated eac

rs  would  say.  "the  whole  tone,  man,  you're

wrecking it."

"tone?"



"the  sound.  you  need  to  get  a  consistent  sound,  like  slow  or  fast,
funny or sad. all these digressions, they just screw up your story's sound.
stick to what happened."

frowning, rat would close his eyes.
"tone?"  he'd  say.  "i  didn't  know  it  was  all  that  complicated.  the  girl

joined the zoo. one more animal—end of story."

"yeah, fine. but tell it right."



at daybreak the next morning, when mark fossie heard she was back,
he  stationed  himself  outside  the  fenced-off  special  forces  area.  all
morning he waited for her, and all afternoon. around dusk rat brought
him something to eat.

"she has to come out," fossie said. "sooner or later, she has to."
"or else what?" rat said.
"i go get her. i bring her out."
rat shook his head. "your decision. i was you, though, no way i'd mess

around with any greenie types, not for nothing."

"it's mary anne in there."
"sure, i know that. all the same,

ones.  stacks  of
bones—all kinds. to one side, propped up against a wall, stood a poster
in neat black lettering: assemble your own gook!!. free sample kit!!. the
images came in a swirl, rat said, and there was no way you could process
it  all.  off  in  the  gloom  a  few  dim  figures  lounged  in  hammocks,  or  on



cots,  but  none  of  them  moved  or  spoke.  the  background  music  came
from a tape deck near the circle of candles, but the high voice was mary
anne's.

after a second mark fossie made a soft moaning sound. he started to

get up but then stiffened.
"mary anne?" he said.
quietly  then,  she  stepped  out  of  the  shadows.  at  least  for  a  moment
she seemed to be the same pretty young girl who had arrived a few weeks
earlier. she was barefoot. she wore her pink sweater and a white blouse
and a simple cotton skirt.

for a long while the girl gazed down at fossie, almost blankly, and in
the candlelight her face had the composure of someone perfectly at peace

ange. in part it was her eyes: utterly flat and indifferent. there was no
emotion in her stare, no sense of the person behind it. but the grotesque
part,  he  said,  was  her  jewelry.  at  the  girl's  throat  was  a  necklace  of
human tongues. elongated and narrow, like pieces of blackened leather,
the  tongues  were  threaded  along  a  length  of  copper  wire,  one
overlapping the next, the tips curled upward as if caught in a final shrill
syllable.

briefly, it seemed, the girl smiled at mark fossie.
"there's  no  sense  talking,"  she  said.  "i  know  what  you  think,  but  it's

not... it's not bad."

"bad?" fossie murmured.
"it's not."
in the shadows there was laughter.
one of the greenies sat up and lighted a cigar. the others lay silent.
"you're in a place," mary anne said softly, "where you don't belong."
she moved her hand in a gesture that encompassed not just the hootch
but everything around it, the entire war, the mountains, the mean little
villages, the trails and trees and ri

 as if to herself, her voice slow and impassive.
she was not trying to persuade. for a few moments she looked at mark
fossie,  who  seemed  to  shrink  away,  then  she  turned  and  moved  back
into the gloom.

there was nothing to be done.
rat  took  fossie's  arm,  helped  him  up,  and  led  him  outside.  in  the
darkness there was that weird tribal music, which seemed to come from
the earth itself, from the deep rain forest, and a woman's voice rising up
in a language beyond translation.

mark fossie stood rigid.
"do something," he whispered. "i can't just let her go like that."
rat listened for a time, then shook his head.
"man, you must be deaf. she's already gone."



rat kiley stopped there, almost in midsentence, which drove mitchell

sanders crazy.

"what next?" he said.
"next?"
"the girl. what happened to her?"
rat  made  a  small,  tired  motion  with  his  shoulders.  "hard  to  tell  for
sure.  maybe  three,  four  days  later  i  got  orders  to  report  here  to  alpha
company.

 mary  anne  walked  off  into  the

mountains and did not come back.

no body was ever found. no equipment, no clothing. for all he knew,
rat said, the girl was still alive. maybe up in one of the high mountain
villes, maybe with the montagnard tribes. but that was guesswork.

there was an inquiry, of course, and a week-long air search, and for a
time the tra bong compound went crazy with mp and cid types. in the
end,  however,  nothing  came  of  it.  it  was  a  war  and  the  war  went  on.
mark fossie was busted to pfc, shipped back to a hospital in the states,
and  two  months  later  received  a  medical  discharge.  mary  anne  bell
joined the missing.

but the story did not end there. if you believed the greenies, rat said,
mary anne was still somewhere out there in the dark. odd movements,



odd  shapes.  late  at  night,  when  the  greenies  were  out  on  ambush,  the
whole rain forest seemed to stare in at them—a watched feeling—and a
couple  of  times  they  almost  saw  her
