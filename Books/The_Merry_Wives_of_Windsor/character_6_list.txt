Caius - 
      The local doctor, Caius is Mistress Quickly's master. He is French, so he suffers the same humiliation as Evans because of his accent and broken English. He hopes to marry Anne Page, and Mistress Page favors him, but Page doesn't, and their conflicting schemes--combined with the fact that Anne does not like him--disrupt his marriage plans. He and Evans also make plans to get back at the Host for making fun of them.
