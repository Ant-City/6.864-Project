Clown	 - 
                Othello's
servant. Although the clown appears only in two short scenes, his
appearances reflect and distort the action and words of the main
plots: his puns on the word "lie" in Act III, scene iv, for example,
anticipate Othello's confusion of two meanings of that word in Act
IV, scene i.
