French noblemen and military leaders - 
 The Constable of France, the Duke of Orleans, the
Duke of Britain, the Duke of Bourbon, the Earl of Grandpre, Lord Rambures,
the Duke of Burgundy, and the Governor of Harfleur are French noblemen
and military leaders. Most of them are killed or captured by the
English at the Battle of Agincourt, though the Duke of Burgundy survives
to help with the peace negotiations between France and England.
Like the Dauphin, most of these leaders are more interested in making
jokes about the English than in taking them seriously as a fighting force,
a tendency that leads to the eventual French defeat at Agincourt.
