attended on by the duke of bedford, regent of france,
the duke of gloucester, protector, the duke of exeter,
the earl of warwick, the bishop of winchester

  bedford. hung be the heavens with black, yield day to
    night! comets, importing change of times and states,
    brandish your crystal tresses in the sky
    and with them scourge the bad revolting stars
    that have consented unto henry's death!
    king henry the fifth, too famous to live long!
    england ne'er lost a king of so much worth.

    his brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams;
    his arms spread wider than a dragon's wings;
    his sparkling eyes, replete with wrathful fire,
    more dazzled and drove back his enemies
    than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.
    what should i say? his deeds exceed all speech:
    he ne'er lift up his hand but conquered.
  exeter. we mourn in black; why mourn we not in blood?
    henry is dead and never shall revive.
    upon a wooden coffin we attend;
    and death's dishonourable victory
    we with our stately presence glorify,
    like captives bound to a triumphant car.
    what! shall we curse the planets of mishap
    that plotted thus our glory's overthrow?
    or shall we think the subtle-witted french
    conjurers and sorcerers, that, afraid of him,
    by magic verses have contriv'd his end?

    of loss, of slaughter, and discomfiture:
    guienne, champagne, rheims, orleans,
    paris, guysors, poictiers, are all quite lost.
  bedford. what say'st thou, man, before dead henry's corse?
    speak softly, or the loss of those great towns
    will make him burst his lead and rise from death.
  gloucester. is paris lost? is rouen yielded up?
    if henry were recall'd to life again,
    these news would cause him once more yield the ghost.
  exeter. how were they lost? what treachery was us'd?
  messenger. no treachery, but want of men and money.
    amongst the soldiers this is muttered
    that here you maintain several factions;
    and whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,
    you are disputing of your generals:
    one would have ling'ring wars, with little cost;
    another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;
    a third thinks, without expense at all,
    by guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd.

  gloucester. now will it best avail your majesty
    to cross the seas and to be crown'd in france:
    the presence of a king engenders love
    amongst his subjects and his loyal friends,
    as it disanimates his enemies.

    not seeing what is likely to ensue.
    this late dissension grown betwixt the peers
    burns under feigned ashes of forg'd love
    and will at last break out into a flame;
    as fest'red members rot but by degree
    till bones and flesh and sinews fall away,
    so will this base and envious discord breed.

    presumptuous vassals, are you not asham'd

    to trouble and disturb the king and us?
    and you, my lords--methinks you do not well
    to bear with their perverse objections,
    much less to take occasion from their mouths
    to raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves.
    let me persuade you take a better course.
  exeter. it grieves his highness. good my lords, be friends.
  king henry. come hither, you that would be combatants:
    henceforth i charge you, as you love our favour,
    quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.
    and you, my lords, remember where we are:
    in france, amongst a fickle wavering nation;
    if they perceive dissension in our looks
    and that within ourselves we disagree,
    how will their grudging stomachs be provok'd
    to wilful disobedience, and rebel!

  king henry. marriage, uncle! alas, my years are young
    and fitter is my study and my books

    her virtues, graced with external gifts,
    do breed love's settled passions in my heart;

    so am i driven by breath of her renown

    that?
    her father is no better than an earl,
    although in glorious titles he excel.
  suffolk. yes, my lord, her father is a king,
    the king of naples and jerusalem;
    and of such great authority in france
    as his alliance will confirm our peace,
    and keep the frenchmen in allegiance.
  gloucester. and so the earl of armagnac may do,
    because he is near kinsman unto charles.
  exeter. beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower;
    where reignier sooner will receive than give.
  suffolk. a dow'r, my lords! disgrace not so your king,
    that he should be so abject, base, and poor,
    to choose for wealth and not for perfect love.
    henry is able to enrich his queen,
    and not to seek a queen to make him rich.
    so worthless peasants bargain for their wives,
