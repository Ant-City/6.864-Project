 cat in
the greatest contest within living memory. she did not marry him
then because he was too poor to pay her bride-price. but a few
years later she ran away from her husband and came to live with
okonkwo. all this happened many years ago. now ekwefi was a
woman of forty-five who had suffered a great deal in her time. but
her love of wrestling contests was still as strong as it was thirty
years ago.

it was not yet noon on the second day of the new yam festival.
ekwefi and her only daughter, ezinma, sat near the fireplace
waiting for the water in the pot to boil. the fowl ekwefi had just
killed was in the wooden mortar. the water began to boil, and in
one deft movement she lifted the pot from the fire and poured the
boiling water over the fowl. she put back the empty pot on the
circular pad in the corner, and looked at her palms, which were
black with soot. ezinma was always surprised that her mother
could lift a pot from the fire with her bare hands.



"ekwefi," she said, "is it true t

hat when people are grown up, fire
does not burn them?" ezinma, unlike most children, called her
mother by her name.



"yes," replied ekwefi, too busy to argue. her daughter was only
ten years old but she was wiser than her years.

"but nwoye's mother dropped her pot of hot soup the other day
and it broke on the floor."

ekwefi turned the hen over in the mortar and began to pluck the
feathers.

"ekwefi," said ezinma, who had joined in plucking the feathers,
"my eyelid is twitching."

"it means you are going to cry," said her mother.

"no," ezinma said, "it is this eyelid, the top one."

"that means you will see something."

"what will i see?" she asked.

"how can i know?" ekwefi wanted her to work it out herself.

"oho," said ezinma at last. "i know what it is—the wrestling
match."

at last the hen was plucked clean. ekwefi tried to pull out the
horny beak but it was too hard. she turned round on her low

 stool
and put the beak in the fire for a few moments. she pulled again
and it came off.

"ekwefi!" a voice called from one of the other huts. it was
nwoye's mother, okonkwo's first wife.



"is that me?" ekwefi called back. that was the way people
answered calls from outside. they never answered yes for fear it
might be an evil spirit calling.



"will you give ezinma some fire to bring to me?" her own
children and ikemefuna had gone to the stream.

ekwefi put a few live coals into a piece of broken pot and ezinma
carried it across the clean swept compound to nwoye's mother.

"thank you, nma," she said. she was peeling new yams, and in a
basket beside her were green vegetables and beans.

"let me make the fire for you," ezinma offered.

"thank you, ezigbo," she said. she often called her ezigbo, which
means "the good one."

ezinma went outside and brought so

lowing it with her breath.

"you will blow your eyes out," said nwoye's mother, looking up
from the yams she was peeling. "use the fan." she stood up and
pulled out the fan which was fastened into one of the rafters. as
soon as she got up, the troublesome nanny goat, which had been
dutifully eating yam peelings, dug her teeth into the real thing,
scooped out two mouthfuls and fled from the hut to chew the cud
in the goats' shed. nwoye's mother swore at her and settled down
again to her peeling. ezinma's fire was now sending up thick
clouds of smoke. she went on fanning it until it burst into flames.
nwoye's mother thanked her and she went back to her mother's hut.

just then the distant beating of drums began to reach them. it came
from the direction of the ilo, the village playground. every village
had its own ilo which was as old as the village itself and where all



the great ceremonies and dances took place. the drums beat the
unmistakable wrestling dance - quick, light and gay, and it

 came
floating on the wind.



okonkwo cleared his throat and moved his feet to the beat of the
drums. it filled him with fire as it had always done from his youth.
he trembled with the desire to conquer and subdue. it was like the
desire for woman.

"we shall be late for the wrestling," said ezinma to her mother.

"they will not begin until the sun goes down."

"but they are beating the drums."

"yes. the drums begin at noon but the wrestling waits until the sun
begins to sink. go and see if your father has brought out yams for
the afternoon."

"he has. nwoye's mother is already cooking."

"go and bring our own, then. we must cook quickly or we shall be
late for the wrestling."

ezinma ran in the direction of the barn and brought back two yams
from the dwarf wall.

ekwefi peeled the yams

young lady. when the pot fell down and broke she burst out
laughing. she only began to weep when they got near the iroko
tree outside their compound.

the drums were still beating, persistent and unchanging. their
sound was no longer a separate thing from the living village. it was
like the pulsation of its heart. it throbbed in the air, in the sunshine,
and even in the trees, and filled the village with excitement.

ekwefi ladled her husband's share of the pottage into a bowl and
covered it. ezinma took it to him in his obi.

okonkwo was sitting on a goatskin already eating his first wife's
meal. obiageli, who had brought it from her mother's hut, sat on
the floor waiting for him to finish. ezinma placed her mother's dish
before him and sat with obiageli.



"sit like a woman!" okonkwo shouted at her. ezinma brought her
two legs together and stretched them in front of her.



"father, will you go to see the wrestling?" ezinma asked after a
suitable interval.

"yes," he answered. "will yo
 
 ___________________________
 
u go?"

"yes." and after a pause she said: "can i bring your chair for
you?"

"no, that is a boy's job." okonkwo was specially fond of ezinma.
she looked very much like her mother, who was once the village
beauty. but his fondness only showed on very rare occasions.

"obiageli broke her pot today," ezinma said.

"yes, she has told me about it," okonkwo said between mouthfuls.

"father," said obiageli, "people should not talk when they are
eating or pepper may go down the wrong way."

"that is very true. do you hear that, ezinma? you are older than
obiageli but she has more sense."

he uncovered his second wife's dish and began to eat from it.
obiageli took the first dish and returned to her mother's hut. and
then nkechi came in, bringing the third dish. nkechi was the
daughter of okonkwo's third

he first time, and
saw those who stood or sat next to them.

"i did not know it was you," ekwefi said to the woman who had
stood shoulder to shoulder with her since the beginning of the
matches.

"i do not blame you," said the woman. "i have never seen such a
large crowd of people. is it true that okonkwo nearly killed you
with his gun?"

"it is true indeed, my dear friend. i cannot yet find a mouth with
which to tell the story."

"your chi is very much awake, my friend. and how is my daughter,
ezinma?"

"she has been very well for some time now. perhaps she has come
to stay."



"i think she has. how old is she now?"

"she is about ten years old."



"i think she will stay. they usually stay if they do not die before
the age of six."

"i pray she stays," said ekwefi with a heavy sigh.

the woman with whom she talked was called chielo. she was the
priestess of agbala, the oracle of the hills and the caves. in
ordinary life chielo was a widow with two children. she was very
friendly with ekw

efi and they shared a common shed in the market.
she was particularly fond of ekwefi's only daughter, ezinma,
whom she called "my daughter." quite often she bought beancakes
and gave ekwefi some to take home to ezinma. anyone seeing
chielo in ordinary life would hardly believe she was the same
person who prophesied when the spirit of agbala was upon her.

the drummers took up their sticks and the air shivered and grew
tense like a tightened bow.

the two teams were ranged facing each other across the clear
space. a young man from one team danced across the center to the
other side and pointed at whomever he wanted to fight. they
danced back to the center together and then closed in.

there were twelve men on

tried the more he thought about him. once he got



up from bed and walked about his compound. but he was so weak
that his legs could hardly carry him. he felt like a drunken giant
walking with the limbs of a mosquito. now and then a cold shiver
descended on his head and spread down his body.



on the third day he asked his second wife, ekwefi, to roast
plantains for him. she prepared it the way he liked—with slices of
oil-bean and fish.

"you have not eaten for two days," said his daughter ezinma when
she brought the food to him. "so you must finish this." she sat
down and stretched her legs in front of her. okonkwo ate the food
absent-mindedly. 'she should have been a boy,' he thought as he
looked at his ten-year-old daughter. he passed her a piece of fish.

"go and bring me some cold water," he said. ezinma rushed out of
the hut, chewing the fish, and soon returned with a bowl of cool
water from the earthen pot in her mother's hut.

okonkwo took the bowl from her and gulped the water

down. he
ate a few more pieces of plaintain and pushed the dish aside.

"bring me my bag," he asked, and ezinma brought his goatskin
bag from the far end of the hut. he searched in it for his snuff-
bottle. it was a deep bag and took almost the whole length of his
arm. it contained other things apart from his snuff-bottle. there
was a drinking horn in it, and also a drinking gourd, and they
knocked against each other as he searched. when he brought out
the snuff-bottle he tapped it a few times against his knee-cap
before taking out some snuff on the palm of his left hand. then he
remembered that he had n

ot taken out his snuff-spoon. he searched
his bag again and brought out a small, flat, ivory spoon, with
which he carried the brown snuff to his nostrils.

ezinma took the dish in one hand and the empty water bowl in the
other and went back to her mother's hut. "she should have been a





boy," okonkwo said to himself again. his mind went back to
ikemefuna and he shivered. if only he could find some work to do
he would be able to forget. but it was the season of rest between
the harvest and the next planting season. the only work that men
did at this time was covering the walls of their compound with new
palm fronds. and okonkwo had already done that.

d to the lad. "your
wrestling the other day gave me much happiness." the boy smiled,
shook hands with okonkwo and went into the compound.



"he will do great things," okonkwo said. "if i had a son like him i
should be happy. i am worried about nwoye. a bowl of pounded
yams can throw him in a wrestling match. his two younger
brothers are more promising. but i can tell you, obierika, that my
children do not resemble me. where are the young suckers that
will grow when the old banana tree dies? if ezinma had been a boy
i would have been happier. she has the right spirit."

"you worry yourself for nothing," said obierika. "the children are
still very young."

"nwoye is old enough to impregnate a woman. at his age i was
already fending for myself. no, my friend, he is not too young. a
chick that will grow into a cock can be spotted the very day it
hatches. i have done my best to make nwoye grow into a man, but
there is too much of his mother in him."

mosquito went away humiliated, and any time he passed her way
he told ear that he was still alive.

okonkwo turned on his side and went back to sleep. he was
roused in the morning by someone banging on his door.

"who is that?" he growled. he knew it must be ekwefi.



of his three wives ekwefi was the only one who would have the
audacity to bang on his door.



"ezinma is dying," came her voice, and all the tragedy and sorrow
of her life were packed in those words.

okonkwo sprang from his bed, pushed back the bolt on his door
and ran into ekwefi's hut.

ezinma lay shivering on a mat beside a huge fire that her mother
had kept burning all night.

"it is iba," said okonkwo as he took his machete and went into the
bush to collect the leaves and grasses and barks of trees that went
into making the medicine for iba.

ekwefi knelt beside the sick child, occasional

palm the wet, burning forehead.

ezinma was an only child and the center of her mother's world.
very often it was ezinma who decided what food her mother
should prepare. ekwefi even gave her such delicacies as eggs,
which children were rarely allowed to eat because such food
tempted them to steal. one day as ezinma was eating an egg
okonkwo had come in unexpectedly from his hut. he was greatly
shocked and swore to beat ekwefi if she dared to give the child
eggs again. but it was impossible to refuse ezinma anything. after
her father's rebuke she developed an even keener appetite for eggs.
and she enjoyed above all the secrecy in which she now ate them.
her mother always took her into their bedroom and shut the door.

ezinma did not call her mother nne like all children. she called her
by her name, ekwefi,
 
 ___________________________
 
ir good fortune. and so, on the day that nwoye's mother
celebrated the birth of her three sons with feasting and music,
ekwefi was the only person in the happy company who went about
with a cloud on her brow. her husband's wife took this for
malevolence, as husbands' wives were wont to. how could she
know that ekwefi's bitterness did not flow outwards to others but
inwards into her own soul,- that she did not blame others for their
good fortune but her own evil chi  who denied her any?

at last ezinma was born, and although ailing she seemed
determined to live. at first ekwefi accepted her, as she had
accepted others—with listless resignation. but when she lived on
to her fourth, fifth and sixth years, love returned once more to her
mother, and, with love, anxiety. she determined to nurse her child
to health, and she put all her being into it. she was rewarded by
occasional spells of health during which ezinma bubbled with
energy like fresh palm-wine. at such times she seemed beyond
danger

. but all of a sudden she would go down again. everybody
knew she was an ogbanje. these sudden bouts of sickness and
health were typical of her kind. but she had lived so long that
perhaps she had decided to stay. some of them did become tired of
their evil rounds of birth and death, or took pity on their mothers,
and stayed. ekwefi believed deep inside her that ezinma had come
to stay. she believed because it was that faith alone that gave her
own life any kind of meaning. and this faith had been strengthened
when a year or so ago a medicine man had dug up ezinma's iyi-



uwa. everyone knew then that she would live because her bond
with the world of ogbanje had been broken. ekwefi was reassured.
but such was her anxiety for her daughter that she could not rid
herself completely of her fear. and although she believed that the
iyi-uwa which had been dug up w
 
 ___________________________
 
as genuine, she could not ignore
the fact that some really evil children sometimes misled people
into digging up a specious one.



but ezinma's iyi-uwa had looked real enough. it was a smooth
pebble wrapped in a dirty rag. the man who dug it up was the
same okagbue who was famous in all the clan for his knowledge
in these matters. ezinma had not wanted to cooperate with him at
first. but that was only to be expected. no ogbanje would yield her
secrets easily, and most of them never did because they died too
young - before they could be asked questions.

"where did you bury your iyi-uwa?" okagbue had asked ezinma.
she was nine then and was just recovering from a serious illness.

"what is iyi-uwa?" she asked in return.

"you know what it is. you buried it in the ground somewhere so
that you can die and return again to torment yo

ur mother."

ezinma looked at her mother, whose eyes, sad and pleading, were
fixed on her.

"answer the question at once," roared okonkwo, who stood beside
her. all the family were there and some of the neighbors too.

"leave her to me," the medicine man told okonkwo in a cool,
confident voice. he turned again to ezinma. "where did you bury
your iyi-uwa?"

"where they bury children," she replied, and the quiet spectators
murmured to themselves.



"come along then and show me the spot," said the medicine man.



the crowd set out with ezinma leading the way and okagbue
following closely behind her. okonkwo came next and ekwefi
followed him. when she came to the main road, ezinma turned left
as if she was going to the stream.

"but you said it was where they bury children?" asked the
medicine man.

"no," said 
 
 ___________________________
 
ezinma, whose feeling of importance was manifest in
her sprightly walk. she sometimes broke into a run and stopped
again suddenly. the crowd followed her silently. women and
children returning from the stream with pots of water on their
heads wondered what was happening until they saw okagbue and
guessed that it must be something to do with ogbanje. and they all
knew ekwefi and her daughter very well.

when she got to the big udala tree ezinma turned left into the bush,
and the crowd followed her. because of her size she made her way
through trees and creepers more quickly than her followers. the
bush was alive with the tread of feet on dry leaves and sticks and
the moving aside of tree branches. ezinma went deeper and deeper
and the crowd went with her. then she suddenly turned round and
began to walk back to the road. everybody stood to let her pass
and then filed after her.

"if you bring us all this way for nothing i shall beat s

ense into
you," okonkwo threatened.

"1 have told you to let her alone. 1 know how to deal with  them,"
said okagbue.

ezinma led the way back to the road, looked left and right and
turned right. and so they arrived home again.



"where did you bury your iyi-uwa?" asked okagbue when ezinma
finally stopped outside her father's obi. okagbue's voice was
unchanged. it was quiet and confident.



"it is near that orange tree," ezinma said.

"and why did you not say so, you wicked daughter of akalogoli?"
okonkwo swore furiously. the medicine man ignored him.

"come and show me the exact spot," he said quietly to ezinma.

"it is here," she said when they got to the tree.

"point at the spot with your finger," said okagbue.

"it is here," said ezinma touching the ground with her finger.
okonkwo stood by, rumbling like thunder in the rainy season.

"bring me a hoe," said okagbue.

'when ekwefi brought the hoe, he had already pu

t aside his
goatskin bag and his big cloth and was in his underwear, a long
and thin strip of cloth wound round the waist like a belt and then
passed between the legs to be fastened to the belt behind. he
immediately set to work digging a pit where ezinma had indicated.
the neighbors sat around watching the pit becoming deeper and
deeper. the dark top soil soon gave way to the bright red earth
with which women scrubbed the floors and walls of huts. okagbue
worked tirelessly and in silence, his back shining with perspiration.
okonkwo stood by the pit. he asked okagbue to come up and rest
while he took a hand. but okagbue said he was not tired yet.

ekwefi went into her hut to cook yams. her husband had brought
out more yams than usual because the
 
 ___________________________
 
 medicine man had to be fed.
ezinma went with her and helped in preparing the vegetables.

"there is too much green vegetable," she said.



"don't you see the pot is full of yams?" ekwefi asked. "and you
know how leaves become smaller after cooking."



"yes," said ezinma, "that was why the snake-lizard killed his
mother."

"very true," said ekwefi.

"he gave his mother seven baskets of vegetables to cook and in the
end there were only three. and so he killed her," said ezinma.

"that is not the end of the story."

"oho," said ezinma. "i remember now. he brought another seven
baskets and cooked them himself. and there were again only three.
so he killed himself too."

outside the obi okagbue and okonkwo were digging the pit to
find where ezinma had buried her iyi-uwa. neighbors sat around,
watching. the pit was now so deep that they no longer saw the
digger. they only saw the red earth he threw up mounting higher
and higher. okonkwo's son, nwoye, stood near the edge 
 
 ___________________________
 
he wanted to take in all that happened.

okagbue had again taken over the digging from okonkwo. he
worked, as usual, in silence. the neighbors and okonkwo's wives
were now talking. the children had lost interest and were playing.

suddenly okagbue sprang to the surface with the agility of a
leopard.

"it is very near now," he said. "i have felt it."

there was immediate excitement and those who were sitting
jumped to their feet.



"call your wife and child," he said to okonkwo. but ekwefi and
ezinma had heard the noise and run out to see what it was.



okagbue went back into the pit, which was now surrounded by
spectators. after a few more hoe-fuls of earth he struck the iyi-uwa.
he raised it carefully with the hoe and threw it to the surface.
some women ran away in fear when it was thrown. but they soon
returned and everyone was gazing at the rag from a reasonable
distance. okagbue emerged and without saying a word or even
looking at the spectators he went to his goatskin bag, took out t

wo
leaves and began to chew them. when he had swallowed them, he
took up the rag with his left hand and began to untie it. and then
the smooth, shiny pebble fell out. he picked it up.

"is this yours?" he asked ezinma.

"yes," she replied. all the women shouted with joy because
ekwefi's troubles were at last ended.

all this had happened more than a year ago and ezinma had not
been ill since. and then suddenly she had begun to shiver in the
night. ekwefi brought her to the fireplace, spread her mat on the
floor and built a fire. but she had got worse and worse. as she
knelt by her, feeling with her palm the wet, burning forehead, she
prayed a thousand times. although her husband's wives were
saying that it was nothing more than iba, she did not hear them.

okonkwo returned from the bush carrying on his left shoulder a
large bundle of grasses and leaves, roots

enough?" she asked when she had poured in about half of
the water in the bowl.

"a little more… i said a little. are you deaf?" okonkwo roared at
her.

she set the pot on the fire and okonkwo took up his machete to
return to his obi.

"you must watch the pot carefully," he said as he went, "and don't
allow it to boil over. if it does its power will be gone." he went
away to his hut and ekwefi began to tend the medicine pot almost
as if it was itself a sick child. her eyes went constantly from
ezinma to the boiling pot and back to ezinma.

okonkwo returned when he felt the medicine had cooked long
anough. he looked it over and said it was done.

"bring me a low stool for ezinma," he said, "and a thick mat."

he took down the pot from the fire and placed it in front of the
stool. he then roused ezinma and placed her on the stool, astride
the steaming pot. the thick mat was thrown over both. ezinma
struggled to escape from the choking and overpowering steam, but
she was held down. she started

"don't you know what kind of man uzowulu is? he will not listen
to any other decision," replied the other.

as they spoke two other groups of people had replaced the first
before the egwugwu, and a great land case began.

chapter eleven

the night was impenetrably dark. the moon had been rising later
and later every night until now it was seen only at dawn. and
whenever the moon forsook evening and rose at cock-crow the
nights were as black as charcoal.

ezinma and her mother sat on a mat on the floor after their supper
of yam foo-foo and bitter-leaf soup. a palm-oil lamp gave out
yellowish light. without it, it would have been impossible to eat,-
one could not have known where one's mouth was in the darkness
of that night. there was an oil lamp in all the four huts on
okonkwo's compound, and each hut seen from the others looked
like a soft eye of yellow half-light set in the solid massiveness of
night.

the world was silent except for the shrill cry

palm, but
nothing came out. he hit the bottle against his knee to shake up the
tobacco. that was always the trouble with okeke's snuff. it very
quickly went damp, and there was too much saltpeter in it.
okonkwo had not bought snuff from him for a long time. idigo
was the man who knew how to grind good snuff. but he had
recently fallen ill.

low voices, broken now and again by singing, reached okonkwo
from his wives' huts as each woman and her children told folk
stories. ekwefi and her daughter, ezinma, sat on a mat on the floor.
it was ekwefl's turn to tell a story.

"once upon a time," she began, "all the birds were invited to a
feast in the sky. they were very happy and began to prepare
themselves for the great day. they painted their bodies with red
cam wood and drew beautiful patterns on them with uli.

"tortoise saw all these preparations and soon discovered what it all
meant. nothing that happened in the world of the animals ever
escaped his notice,- he was full of cunning. as soon as 
 
 ___________________________
 
he heard of
the great feast in the sky his throat began to itch at the very thought.
there was a famine in those days and tortoise had not eaten a
good meal for two moons. his body rattled like a piece of dry stick
in his empty shell. so he began to plan how he would go to the
sky."

"but he had no wings," said ezinma.




"be patient," replied her mother. "that is the story. tortoise had no
wings, but he went to the birds and asked to be allowed to go with
them.

"'we know you too well,' said the birds when they had heard him.
'you are full of cunning and you are ungrateful. if we allow you to
come with us you will soon begin your mischief.'

"'you do not know me,' said tortoise. '1 am a changed man. i have
learned that a man who makes trouble for others is also making it
for himself.'

"tortoise had a swe

d tortoise's house he told his wife to bring
out all the hard things in the house. and so she brought out her
husband's hoes, machetes, spears, guns and even his cannon.
tortoise looked down from the sky and saw his wife bringing
things out, but it was too far to see what they were. when all
seemed ready he let himself go. he fell and fell and fell until he
began to fear that he would never stop falling. and then like the
sound of his cannon he crashed on the compound." ';,; "did he
die?" asked ezinma.

"no," replied ekwefi. "his shell broke into pieces. but there was a
great medicine man in the neighborhood. tortoise's wife sent for
him and he gathered all the bits of shell and stuck them together.
that is why tortoise's shell is not smooth."

"there is no song in the story," ezinma pointed out.

"no," said ekwefi. "1 shall think of another one with a song. but it
is your turn now."

"once upon a time," ezinma began, "tortoise and cat went to

 silence of the night. it was chielo, the



priestess of agbala, prophesying. there was nothing new in that.
once in a while chielo was possessed by the spirit of her god and
she began to prophesy. but tonight she was addressing her
prophecy and greetings to okonkwo, and so everyone in his family
listened. the folk stories stopped.



"agbala do-o-o-o! agbala ekeneo-o-o-o-o," came the voice like a
sharp knife cutting through the night. "okonkwo! agbala ekme gio-
o-o-o! agbala cholu ifu ada ya ezinmao-o-o-oi"

at the mention of ezinma's name ekwefi jerked her head sharply
like an animal that had sniffed death in the air. her heart jumped
painfully within her.

the priestess had now reached okonkwo's compound and was
talking with him outside his hut. she was saying again and again
that agbala wanted to see his daughter, ezinma. okonkwo pleaded
with her to come back in the morning because ezinma was now
asleep. but chielo ignored what he was trying to say and went on
shouting that agbala want

he said. okonkwo was still pleading that the girl
had been ill of late and was asleep. ekwefi quickly took her to their
bedroom and placed her on their high bamboo bed.

the priestess screamed. "beware, okonkwo!" she warned.
"beware of exchanging words with agbala. does a man speak
when a god speaks? beware!"

she walked through okonkwo's hut into the circular compound
and went straight toward ekwefi's hut. okonkwo came after her.

"ekwefi," she called, "agbala greets you. where is my daughter,
ezinma? agbala wants to see her."



ekwefi came out from her hut carrying her oil lamp in her left
hand. there was a light wind blowing, so she cupped her right
hand to shelter the flame. nwoye's mother, also carrying an oil
lamp, emerged from her hut. the children stood in the darkness
outside their hut watching the strange event. okonkwo's youngest
wife also came out and joined the others.



"where does agbala want to see her?" ekwefi asked.

"where else but in his house in the hills and the cave

s?" replied the
priestess.

"i will come with you, too," ekwefi said firmly.

"tufia-al" the priestess cursed, her voice cracking like the angry
bark of thunder in the dry season. "how dare you, woman, to go
before the mighty agbala of your own accord? beware, woman,
lest he strike you in his anger. bring me my daughter."

ekwefi went into her hut and came out again with ezinma.

"come, my daughter," said the priestess. "i shall carry you on my
back. a baby on its mother's back does not know that the way is
long."

ezinma began to cry. she was used to chielo calling her "my
daughter." but it was a different chielo she now saw in the yellow
half-light.

"don't cry, my daughter," said the priestess, "lest agbala be angry
with you."

"don't cry," said ekwefi, "she will bring you back very soon. i
shall give you some fish to eat." she went into the hut again and
brought d

own the smoke-black basket in which she kept her dried
fish and other ingredients for cooking soup. she broke a piece in
two and gave it to ezinma, who clung to her.



"don't be afraid," said ekwefi, stroking her head, which was
shaved in places, leaving a regular pattern of hair. they went
outside again. the priestess bent down on one knee and ezinma
climbed on her back, her left palm closed on her fish and her eyes
gleaming with tears.



"agbala do-o-o-o! agbala ekeneo-o-o-o! …" chielo began once
again to chant greetings to her god. she turned round sharply and
walked through okonkwo's hut, bending very low at the eaves.
ezinma was crying loudly now, calling on her mother. the two
voices disappeared into the thick darkness.

a strange and sudden weakness descended on ekwefi as she stood
gazing in the direction of the voices like a hen w

has been carried away by a kite. ezinma's voice soon faded away
and only chielo was heard moving farther and farther into the
distance.

"why do you stand there as though she had been kidnapped?"
asked okonkwo as he went back to his hut.

"she will bring her back soon," nwoye's mother said.

but ekwefi did not hear these consolations. she stood for a while,
and then, all of a sudden, made up her mind. she hurried through
okonkwo's hut and went outside. "where are you going?" he asked.

"i am following chielo," she replied and disappe

t in the direction
of the voice. her eyes were useless to her in the darkness. but she
picked her way easily on the sandy footpath hedged on either side
by branches and damp leaves. she began to run, holding her





breasts with her hands to stop them flapping noisily against her
body. she hit her left foot against an outcropped root, and terror
seized her. it was an ill omen. she ran faster. but chielo's voice
was still a long way away. had she been running too? how could
she go so fast with ezinma on her back? although the night was
cool, ekwefi was beginning to feel hot from her running. she
continually ran into the luxuriant weeds and creepers that walled in
the path. once she tripped up and fell. only then did she realize,
with a start, that chielo had stopped her chanting. her heart beat
violently and she stood still. then chielo's renewed outburst came
from only a few paces ahead. but ekwefi could not see her. she
shut her eyes for a while and opened them again in an effort to see.

mother on a dark night like this when they saw its glow as it flew
in their direction. they had thrown down their water-pots and lain
by the roadside expecting the sinister light to descend on them and
kill them. that was the only time ekwefi ever saw ogbu-agali-odu.



but although it had happened so long ago, her blood still ran cold
whenever she remembered that night.



the priestess' voice came at longer intervals now, but its vigor was
undiminished. the air was cool and damp with dew. ezinma
sneezed. ekwefi muttered, "life to you." at the same time the
priestess also said, "life to you, my daughter."

ezinma's voice from the darkness warmed her mother's heart. she
trudged slowly along.

and then the priestess screamed. "somebody is walking behind
me!" she said. "whether you are spirit or man, may agbala shave
your head with a blunt razor! may he twist your neck until you see
your heels!"

ekwefi stood rooted to the spot. one mind said to her: "woman,
go home before agbala does you

ady gaze and then formed again in new shapes. at one
stage ekwefi was so afraid that she nearly called out to chielo for
companionship and human sympathy. what she had seen was the
shape of a man climbing a palm tree, his head pointing to the earth
and his legs skywards. but at that very moment chielo's voice rose
again in her possessed chanting, and ekwefi recoiled, because
there was no humanity there. it was not the same chielo who sat
with her in the market and sometimes bought beancakes for
ezinma, whom she called her daughter. it was a different




woman—the priestess of agbala, the oracle of the hills and caves.
ekwefi trudged along between two fears. the sound of her
benumbed steps seemed to come from some other person walking
behind her. her arms were folded across her bare breasts. dew fell
heavily and the air was cold. she could no longer think, not even
about the terrors of night. she just jogged along in a half-sleep,
only waking to full life when chielo sang.

at last they t

ook a turning and began to head for the caves. from
then on, chielo never ceased in her chanting. she greeted her god
in a multitude of names—the owner of the future, the messenger of
earth, the god who cut a man down when his life was sweetest to
him. ekwefi was also awakened and her benumbed fears revived.

the moon was now up and she could see chielo and ezinma
clearly. how a woman could carry a child of that size so easily and
for so long was a miracle. but ekwefi was not thinking about that.
chielo was not a woman that night.

"agbala do-o-o-o! agbala ekeneo-o-o-o! chi negbu madu ubosi
ndu ya nato ya uto daluo-o-o! …"

ekwefi could already see the hills looming in the moonlight. they
formed a circular ring with a break at one point through which the
foot-track led to the center of the circle.

as soon as the priestess stepped into this ring of hil

ls her voice was
not only doubled in strength but was thrown back on all sides. it
was indeed the shrine of a great god. ekwefi picked her way
carefully and quietly. she was already beginning to doubt the
wisdom of her coming. nothing would

happen to ezinma, she thought. and if anything happened to her
could she stop it? she would not dare to enter the underground
caves. her coming was quite useless, she thought.





as these things went through her mind she did not realize how
close they were to the cave mouth. and so when the priestess with
ezinma on her back disappeared through a hole hardly big enough
to pass a hen, ekwefi broke into a run as though to stop them. as
she stood gazing at the circular darkness which had swallowed
them, tears gu

shed from her eyes, and she swore within her that if
she heard ezinma cry she would rush into the cave to defend her
against all the gods in the world. she would die with her.

having sworn that oath, she sat down on a stony ledge and waited.
her fear had vanished. she could hear the priestess' voice, all its
metal taken out of it by the vast emptiness of the cave. she buried
her face in her lap and waited.

she did not know how long she waited. it must have been a very
long time. her back was turned on the footpath that led out of the
hills. she must have heard

were ready to set out for obierika's compound with all their
children. nwoye's mother carried a basket of coco-yams, a cake of
salt and smoked fish which she would present to obierika's wife.
okonkwo's youngest wife, ojiugo, also had a basket of plantains
and coco-yams and a small pot of palm-oil. their children carried
pots of water.

ekwefi was tired and sleepy from the exhausting experiences of
the previous night. it was not very long since they had returned.
the priestess, with ezinma sleeping on her back, had crawled out
of the shrine on her belly like a snake. she had not as much as





looked at okonkwo and ekwefi or shown any surprise at finding
them at the mouth of the cave. she looked straight ahead of her and
walked back to the village. okonkwo and his wife followed at a
respectful distance. they thought the priestess might be going to
her house, but she went to okonkwo's compound, passed through
his obi and into ekwefi's hut and walked into her bedroom. she
placed

ezinma carefully on the bed and went away without saying
a word to anybody.

ezinma was still sleeping when everyone else was astir, and
ekwefi asked nwoye's mother and ojiugo to explain to obierika's
wife that she would be late. she had got ready her basket of coco-
yams and fish, but she must wait for ezinma to wake.

"you need some sleep yourself," said nwoye's mother. "you look
very tired."

as they spoke ezinma emerged from the hut, rubbing her eyes and
stretching her spare frame. she saw the other children with their
water-pots and remembered that they were going to fetch water for
obierika's wife. she went back to the hut and brought her pot.

"have you slept enough?" asked her mother.

"yes," she replied. "let us go."

"not before you have had your breakfast," said ekwefi. and she
went into her hut to warm the vegetable soup she had cooked last
night.

"we shall be going," said nwoye's mother. "i w

u not think that they
came to our clan by mistake, that they have strayed from their way
to a land where everybody is like them?"

okonkwo's first wife soon finished her cooking and set before their
guests a big meal of pounded yams and bitter-leaf soup.



okonkwo's son, nwoye, brought in a pot of sweet wine tapped
from the raffia palm.



"you are a big man now," obierika said to nwoye. "your friend
anene asked me to greet you."

"is he well?" asked nwoye.

"we are all well," said obierika.

ezinma brought them a bowl of water with which to wash their
hands. after that they began to eat and to drink the wine.

"when did you set out from home?" asked okonkwo.

"we had meant to set out from my house before cockcrow," said
obierika. "but nweke did not appear until it was quite light. never
make an early morning appointment with a man who has just
married a new wife." they all laughed.

"has nweke married a wife?" asked okonkwo.

"he has married okadigbo's second daughter," said obierika.

"t

ekwefi still had some cassava left on her farm from the previous
year. neither of the other wives had. it was not that they had been



lazy, but that they had many children to feed. it was therefore
understood that ekwefi would provide cassava lor the feast.
nwoye's mother and ojiugo would provide the  other things like
smoked fish, palm-oil and pepper for the soup. okonkwo would
take care of meat and yams.



ekwefi rose early on the following morning and went to her farm
with her daughter, ezinma, and ojiugo's daughter, obiageli, to
harvest cassava tubers. each of them carried a long cane basket, a
machete for cutting down the soft cassava stem, and a little hoe for
digging out the tuber. fortunately, a light rain had fallen during the
night and the soil would not be very hard.

"it will not take us long to harvest as much as we like," said
ekwefi.

"but the leaves will be wet," said ezinma. her basket was
balanced on her head, and her arms folded across her breasts. she
felt cold. "i d

islike cold water dropping on my back. we should
have waited for the sun to rise and dry the leaves."

obiageli called her "salt" because she said that she disliked water.
"are you afraid you may dissolve?"

the harvesting was easy, as ekwefi had said. ezinma shook every
tree violently with a long stick before she bent down to cut the
stem and dig out the tuber. sometimes it was not necessary to dig.
they just pulled the stump, and earth rose, roots snapped below,
and the tuber was pulled out.

when they had harvested a sizable heap they carried it down in
two trips to the stream, where every woman had a shallow well for
fermenting her cassava.

"it should be ready in four days or even three," said obiageli.
"they are young tubers."



"they are no

sat in his obi. the
youngest of them was four years old.

"you have all seen the great abomination of your brother. now he
is no longer my son or your brother. i will only have a son who is a
man, who will hold his head up among my people. if any one of
you prefers to be a woman, let him follow nwoye now while i am
alive so that i can curse him. if you turn against me when i am
dead i will visit you and break your neck."

okonkwo was very lucky in his daughters. he never stopped
regretting that ezinma was a girl. of all his children she alone
understood his every mood. a bond of sympathy had grown
between them as the years had passed.

ezinma grew up in her father's exile and became one of the most
beautiful girls in mbanta. she was called crystal of beauty, as her
mother had been called in her youth. the young ailing girl who
had caused her mother so much heartache had been transformed,
almost overnight, into a healthy, buoyant maiden. she had, it was
true, her moments of depression when sh

y dog. these moods descended on her
suddenly and for no apparent reason. but they were very rare and
short-lived. as long as they lasted, she could bear no other person
but her father.

many young men and prosperous middle-aged men of mbanta
came to marry her. but she refused them all, because her father had
called her one evening and said to her: "there are many good and
prosperous people here, but i shall be happy if you marry in
umuofia when we return home."



that was all he had said. but ezinma had seen clearly all the
thought and hidden meaning behind the few words. and she had
agreed.



"your half-sister, obiageli, will not understand me," okonkwo
said. "but you can explain to her."

although they were almost the same age, ezinma wielded a strong
influence over her half-sister. she explained to her why they
should not marry yet, and she agreed also. and so the two of them
refused every offer of marriage in mbanta.

"i wish she were a boy," okonkwo thought within himself. she

to run.

the silence was broken by the village crier beating his sonorous
ogene. he called every man in umuofia, from the akakanma age
group upwards, to a meeting in the marketplace after the morning
meal. he went from one end of the village to the other and walked
all its breadth. he did not leave out any of the main footpaths.

okonkwo's compound was like a deserted homestead. it was as if
cold water had been poured on it. his family was all there, but
everyone spoke in whispers. his daughter ezinma had broken her
twenty-eight day visit to the family of her future husband, and
returned home when she heard that her father had been imprisoned,
and was going to be hanged. as soon as she got home she went to




obierika to ask what the men of umuofia were going to do about it.
but obierika had not been home since morning. his wives thought
he had gone to a secret meeting. ezinma was satisfied that
something was being done.

on the morning after the village crier's appeal the men of umuofia

the six men met women and children going to the stream with their
waterpots. but the men wore such heavy and fearsome looks that
the women and children did not say "nno" or "welcome" to them,
but edged out of the way to let them pass. in the village little
groups of men joined them until they became a sizable company.
they walked silently. as each of the six men got to his compound,
he turned in, taking some of the crowd with him. the village was
astir in a silent, suppressed way.



ezinma had prepared some food for her father as soon as news
spread that the six men would be released. she took it to him in his
obi. he ate absent-mindedly. he had no appetite, he only ate to
please her. his male relations and friends had gathered in his obi,
and obierika was urging him to eat. nobody else spoke, but they
noticed the long stripes on okonkwo's back where the warder's
whip had cut into his flesh.



the village crier was abroad again in the night. he beat his iron
gong and announced t
