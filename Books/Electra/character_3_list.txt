Chrysothemis - 
      Chrysothemis is the younger daughter of Clytemnestra and Agamemnon. Although she recognizes her mother's corruption and although she understands the injustice of her father's murder, she refuses to mourn in the way that her sister, Electra, does. She realizes that she will gain the greatest benefits by siding with those in control. Unlike Electra, who adheres to the principles of justice, Chrysothemis clings to the principle of expediency in the hopes of maximizing her own comfort and profit.
