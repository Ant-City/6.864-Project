enter king john, queen elinor, pembroke, essex, salisbury, and
others,
with chatillon

  king john. now, say, chatillon, what would france with us?
  chatillon. thus, after greeting, speaks the king of france
    in my behaviour to the majesty,
    the borrowed majesty, of england here.
  elinor. a strange beginning- 'borrowed majesty'!
  king john. silence, good mother; hear the embassy.
  chatillon. philip of france, in right and true behalf
    of thy deceased brother geffrey's son,
    arthur plantagenet, lays most lawful claim
    to this fair island and the terr

itories,
    to ireland, poictiers, anjou, touraine, maine,
    desiring thee to lay aside the sword
    which sways usurpingly these several titles,
    and put the same into young arthur's hand,
    thy nephew and right royal sovereign.
  king john. what follows if we disallow of this?
  chatillon. the proud control of fierce and bloody war,
    to enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.
  king john. here have we war for war, and blood for blood,
    controlment for controlment- so answer france.
  chatillon. then take my king's defiance from my mouth-
    the farthest limit of my embassy.
  king john. bear mine to him, and so depart in peace;
    be thou as lightning in the eyes of france;
    for ere thou canst report i will be there,
    the thunder of my cannon shall be h

eard.
    so hence! be thou the trumpet of our wrath
    and sullen presage of your own decay.
    an honourable conduct let him have-
    pembroke, look to 't. farewell, chatillon.
                                        exeunt chatillon and
pembroke
  elinor. what now, my son! have i not ever said
    how that ambitious constance would not cease
    till she had kindled france and all the world
    upon the right and party of her son?
    this might have been prevented and made whole
    with very easy arguments of love,
    which now the manage of two kingdoms must
    with fearful bloody issue arbitrate.
  king john. our strong possession and our right for us!
  elinor. your strong possession much more than your r

    in such a just and charitable war.
  king philip. well then, to work! our cannon shall be bent
    against the brows of this resisting town;
    call for our chiefest men of discipline,
    to cull the plots of best advantages.
    we'll lay before this town our royal bones,
    wade to the market-place in frenchmen's blood,
    but we will make it subject to this boy.
  constance. stay for an answer to your embassy,
    lest unadvis'd you stain your swords with blood;
    my lord chatillon may from england bring
    that right in peace which here we urge in war,
    and then we shall repent each drop of blood
    that hot rash haste so indirectly shed.

                  enter chatillon

  king philip. a wonder, lady! lo, upon thy wish,
    our messenger chatillon is arriv'd.
    what england says, say briefly, gentle lord;
    we coldly pause for thee. chatillon, speak.
  chatillon. then turn your forces from this paltry siege
    and stir them up against a mightier
