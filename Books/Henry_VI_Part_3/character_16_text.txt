  marg. i now begins a second storme to rise,
for this is hee that moues both winde and tyde

   warw. from worthy edward, king of albion,
my lord and soueraigne, and thy vowed friend,
i come (in kindnesse, and vnfayned loue)
first, to doe greetings to thy royall person,
and then to craue a league of amitie:
and lastly, to confirme that amitie
with nuptiall knot, if thou vouchsafe to graunt
that vertuous lady bona, thy faire sister,
to englands king, in lawfull marriage

   warw. and gracious madame,

speaking to bona.

in our kings behalfe,
i am commanded, with your leaue and fauor,
humbly to kisse your hand, and with my tongue
to tell the passion of my soueraignes heart;
where fame, late entring at his heedfull eares,

   lewis. then further: all dissembling set aside,
tell me for truth, the measure of his loue
vnto our sister bona

   war. such it seemes,
as may beseeme a monarch like himselfe.
my selfe haue often heard him say, and sweare,
that this his loue was an externall plant,
whereof the root was fixt in vertues ground,
the leaues and fruit maintain'd with beauties sunne,
exempt from enuy, but not from disdaine,
vnlesse the lady bona quit his paine

   lewis. now sister, let vs heare your firme resolue

   bona. your graunt, or your denyall, shall be mine.
yet i confesse, that often ere this day,

speaks to war[wicke].

when i haue heard your kings desert recounted,
mine eare hath tempted iudgement to desire

   lewis. then warwicke, thus:
our sister shall be edwards.
and now forthwith shall articles be drawne,

did i forget, that by the house of yorke
my father came vntimely to his death?
did i let passe th' abuse done to my neece?
did i impale him with the regall crowne?
did i put henry from his natiue right?
and am i guerdon'd at the last, with shame?
shame on himselfe, for my desert is honor.
and to repaire my honor lost for him,
i heere renounce him, and returne to henry.
my noble queene, let former grudges passe,
and henceforth, i am thy true seruitour:
i will reuenge his wrong to lady bona,
and replant henry in his former state

   mar. warwicke,
these words haue turn'd my hate, to loue,
and i forgiue, and quite forget old faults,
and ioy that thou becom'st king henries friend

that if king lewis vouchsafe to furnish vs
with some few bands of chosen soldiours,
ile vndertake to land them on our coast,
and force the tyrant from his seat by warre.
'tis not his new-made bride shall succour him.
