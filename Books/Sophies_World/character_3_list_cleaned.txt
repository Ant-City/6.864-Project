[CHARACTER] has an ironic sense of humor and cares very much about the world. he works for the un and he wants people to live in peace and harmony. albert also very much wants his daughter to see the world (and the universe) as the special place that it is. he wants her to learn about philosophy so that she will be able to think and live in the way that he thinks is proper. like alberto, he is a philosopher at heart, and the world itself is enough entertainment for him.
