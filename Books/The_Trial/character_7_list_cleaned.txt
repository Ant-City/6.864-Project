block, the tradesman  - 
      block is another accused man and client of huld. his case is five year's old, and he is but a shadow of the prosperous man he once was. all his time, energy, and resources are now devoted to his case. although he has hired hack lawyers on the side, he is completely and pathetically subservient to huld.
