folks with our bare handsâ€¦â€ aunt alexandra stared him to silence. â€œit was not a
hundred folks,â€ she said, â€œand nobody held anybody off. it was just a nest of
those cunninghams, drunk and disorderly.â€
â€œaw, aunty, thatâ€™s just dillâ€™s way,â€ said jem. he signaled us to follow him.
â€œyou all stay in the yard today,â€ she said, as we made our way to the front porch.
it was like saturday. people from the south end of the county passed our house in
a leisurely but steady stream.
mr. dolphus raymond lurched by on his thoroughbred. â€œdonâ€™t see how he stays
in the saddle,â€ murmured jem. â€œhow câ€™n you stand to get drunk â€˜fore eight in the
morning?â€
a wagonload of ladies rattled past us. they wore cotton sunbonnets and dresses
with long sleeves. a bearded man in a wool hat drove them. â€œyonderâ€™s some
mennonites,â€ jem said to dill. â€œthey donâ€™t have buttons.â€ they lived deep in the
woods, did most of their trading across the river, and rarely came to maycomb.
dill was inte

some people were
gnawing on cold chicken and cold fried pork chops. the more affluent chased
their food with drugstore coca-cola in bulb-shaped soda glasses. greasy-faced
children popped-the-whip through the crowd, and babies lunched at their mothersâ€™
breasts.
in a far corner of the square, the negroes sat quietly in the sun, dining on
sardines, crackers, and the more vivid flavors of nehi cola. mr. dolphus
raymond sat with them.
â€œjem,â€ said dill, â€œheâ€™s drinkinâ€˜ out of a sack.â€
mr. dolphus raymond seemed to be so doing: two yellow drugstore straws ran
from his mouth to the depths of a brown paper bag.
â€œainâ€™t ever seen anybody do that,â€ murmured dill.
â€œhow does he keep whatâ€™s in it in it?â€
jem giggled. â€œheâ€™s got a co-cola bottle full of whiskey in there. thatâ€™s soâ€™s not
to upset the ladies. youâ€™ll see him sip it all afternoon, heâ€™ll step out for a while
and fill it back up.â€
â€œwhyâ€™s he sittinâ€˜ with the colored folks?â€

â€œalways does. he likes â€˜em bette

™s too long ago to matter.â€
â€œthatâ€™s what i thought,â€ said jem, â€œbut around here once you have a drop of
negro blood, that makes you all black. hey, lookâ€”â€
some invisible signal had made the lunchers on the square rise and scatter bits of
newspaper, cellophane, and wrapping paper. children came to mothers, babies
were cradled on hips as men in sweat-stained hats collected their families and
herded them through the courthouse doors. in the far corner of the square the
negroes and mr. dolphus raymond stood up and dusted their breeches. there
were few women and children among them, which seemed to dispel the holiday
mood. they waited patiently at the doors behind the white families.
â€œletâ€™s go in,â€ said dill.
â€œnaw, we better wait till they get in, atticus might not like it if he sees us,â€ said
jem.
the maycomb county courthouse was faintly reminiscent of arlington in one
respect: the concrete pillars supporting its south roof were too heavy for their light
burden. the pillars were a

ith his right hand on the back of his chair. he looked oddly off
balance, but it was not from the way he was standing. his left arm was fully
twelve inches shorter than his right, and hung dead at his side. it ended in a small
shriveled hand, and from as far away as the balcony i could see that it was no use
to him.

â€œscout,â€ breathed jem. â€œscout, look! reverend, heâ€™s crippled!â€
reverend sykes leaned across me and whispered to jem. â€œhe got it caught in a
cotton gin, caught it in mr. dolphus raymondâ€™s cotton gin when he was a boyâ€¦
like to bled to deathâ€¦ tore all the muscles loose from his bonesâ€”â€
atticus said, â€œis this the man who raped you?â€
â€œit most certainly is.â€
atticusâ€™s next question was one word long. â€œhow?â€
mayella was raging. â€œi donâ€™t know how he done it, but he done itâ€”i said it all
happened so fast iâ€”â€
â€œnow letâ€™s consider this calmlyâ€”â€ began atticus, but mr. gilmer interrupted
with an objection: he was not irrelevant or immaterial, but a

 been the loneliest person in the world. she was even lonelier than boo
radley, who had not been out of the house in twenty-five years. when atticus
asked had she any friends, she seemed not to know what he meant, then she
thought he was making fun of her. she was as sad, i thought, as what jem called a
mixed child: white people wouldnâ€™t have anything to do with her because she
lived among pigs; negroes wouldnâ€™t have anything to do with her because she
was white. she couldnâ€™t live like mr. dolphus raymond, who preferred the
company of negroes, because she didnâ€™t own a riverbank and she wasnâ€™t from a
fine old family. nobody said, â€œthatâ€™s just their way,â€ about the ewells. maycomb
gave them christmas baskets, welfare money, and the back of its hand. tom
robinson was probably the only person who was ever decent to her. but she said
he took advantage of her, and when she stood up she looked at him as if he were
dirt beneath her feet.
â€œdid you ever,â€ atticus interrupted my meditations,

ilmer seemed to
me like he wasnâ€™t half trying. they do â€™em all that way, most lawyers, i mean.â€
â€œmr. finch doesnâ€™t.â€
â€œheâ€™s not an example, dill, heâ€™sâ€”â€ i was trying to grope in my memory for a
sharp phrase of miss maudie atkinsonâ€™s. i had it: â€œheâ€™s the same in the
courtroom as he is on the public streets.â€
â€œthatâ€™s not what i mean,â€ said dill.
â€œi know what you mean, boy,â€ said a voice behind us. we thought it came from
the tree-trunk, but it belonged to mr. dolphus raymond. he peered around the
trunk at us. â€œyou arenâ€™t thin-hided, it just makes you sick, doesnâ€™t it?â€

â€œcome on round here, son, i got something thatâ€™ll settle your stomach.â€
as mr. dolphus raymond was an evil man i accepted his invitation reluctantly,
but i followed dill. somehow, i didnâ€™t think atticus would like it if we became
friendly with mr. raymond, and i knew aunt alexandra wouldnâ€™t.
â€œhere,â€ he said, offering dill his paper sack with

retend? well, itâ€™s very simple,â€ he said.
â€œsome folks donâ€™tâ€”like the way i live. now i could say the hell with â€˜em, i donâ€™t
care if they donâ€™t like it. i do say i donâ€™t care if they donâ€™t like it, right enoughâ€”
but i donâ€™t say the hell with â€™em, see?â€
dill and i said, â€œno sir.â€
â€œi try to give â€˜em a reason, you see. it helps folks if they can latch onto a reason.
when i come to town, which is seldom, if i weave a little and drink out of this
sack, folks can say dolphus raymondâ€™s in the clutches of whiskeyâ€”thatâ€™s why
he wonâ€™t change his ways. he canâ€™t help himself, thatâ€™s why he lives the way he
does.â€
â€œthat ainâ€™t honest, mr. raymond, making yourself out badderâ€™n you are already
â€”â€
â€œit ainâ€™t honest but itâ€™s mighty helpful to folks. secretly, miss finch, iâ€™m not
much of a drinker, but you see they could never, never understand that i live like i
do because thatâ€™s the way i want to live.â€

i had a feeling that i shouldnâ€™t be here l
