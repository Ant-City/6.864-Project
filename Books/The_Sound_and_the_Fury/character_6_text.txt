need to open any one of them again. i believed that i knew then why i had 
not recaptured that first ecstasy, and that i should never again recapture it; 
that whatever treenovels i should write in the future would be written 
without reluctance, but also without anticipation or joy: that in the sound 
and the fury i had already put perhaps the only thing in literature which 
would ever move me very much: caddy climbing the pear tree to look in 

the window at her grandmother's funeral while quentin and jason and 
benjy and the negroes looked up at the muddy seat of her drawers.  
     this is the only one of the seven novels which i wrote without any 
accompanying feeling of drive or effort, or any following feeling of 
exhaustion or relief or distaste. when i began it i had no plan at all. i 
wasn't even writing a book. i was thinking of books, publication, only in the 
reverse, in saying to myself, i wont have to worry about publishers liking or 
not liking this at all. four years befor

     i saw that they had been sent to the pasture to spend the afternoon to 
get them away from the house during the grandmother's funeral in order 
that the three brothers and the nigger children could look up at the muddy 
seat of caddy's drawers as she climbed the tree to look in the window at the 
funeral, without then realising the symbology of the soiled drawers, for 
here again hers was the courage which was to face later with honor the 

shame which she was to engender, which quentin and jason could not 
face: the one taking refuge in suicide, the other in vindictive rage which 
drove him to rob his bastard niece of the meagre sums which caddy could 
send her. for i had already gone on to night and the bedroom and dilsey 
with the mudstained drawers scrubbing the naked backside of that doomed 
little girl--trying to cleanse with the sorry byblow of its soiling that body, 
flesh, whose shame they symbolised and prophesied, as though she already 
saw the dark future and the p

nd yet nebulous to describe which the writing of benjy's section of the 
sound and the fury gave me--that ecstasy, that eager and joyous faith and 

anticipation of surprise which the yet unmarred sheets beneath my hand 
held inviolate and unfailing--will not return. the unreluctance to begin, the 
cold satisfaction in work well and arduously done, is there and will 
continue to be there as long as i can do it well. but that other will not 
return. i shall never know it again.  
     so i wrote quentin's and jason's sections, trying to clarify benjy's. but i 
saw that i was merely temporising; that i should have to get completely 
out of the book. i realised that there would be compensations, that in a 
sense i could then give a final turn to the screw and extract some ultimate 
distillation. yet it took me better than a month to take pen and write the 
day dawned bleak and chill before i did so. there is a story somewhere 
about an old roman who kept at his bedside a tyrrhenian vase which he

"your mommer going to whip you for getting your dress wet."  
"she's not going to do any such thing." caddy said.  
"how do you know." quentin said.

"taint none of my dress." versh said.  
"you unbutton it, versh." caddy said. "or i'll tell dilsey what you did 
yesterday." so versh unbuttoned it.  
"you just take your dress off." quentin said. caddy took her dress off and 
threw it on the bank. then she didn't have on anything but her bodice and 
drawers, and quentin slapped her and she slipped and fell down in the 
water. when she got up she began to splash water on quentin, and quentin 
splashed water on caddy. some of it splashed on versh and me and versh 
picked me up and put me on the bank. he said he was going to tell on 
caddy and quentin, and then quentin and caddy began to splash water at 
versh. he got behind a bush.

"i'm going to tell mammy on you all." versh said.  
quentin climbed up the bank and tried to catch versh, but versh ran away 
and quentin couldn't. when quentin came back versh stopped and 

hollered that he was going to tell. caddy told him that if he wouldn't tell, 
they'd let him come back. so versh said he wouldn't, and they let him.  
"now i guess you're satisfied." quentin said. "we'll both get whipped now."  
"i dont care." caddy said. "i'll run away."  
"yes you will." quentin said.  
"i'll run away and never come back." caddy said. i began to cry.  
caddy turned around and said "hush" so i hushed. then they played in the 
branch. jason was playing too. he was by himself further down the branch. 
versh came around the bush and lifted me down into the water again. 
caddy was all wet and muddy behind, and i started to cry and she came 
and squatted in the water.  
"hush now." she said. "i'm not going to run away." so i hushed. caddy

branch. he was chunking into the shadows where the branch was.  
"let the old skizzard stay there." caddy said. she took my hand and we 
went on past the barn and through the gate. there was a frog on the brick 
walk, squatting in the middle of it. caddy stepped over it and pulled me on.  
"come on, maury." she said. it still squatted there until jason poked at it 
with his toe.

the letters through my coat.   
     i will not have my daughter spied on by you or quentin or anybody no

     from then on until he had you completely subjugated he was always in 
or out of your room, ubiquitous and garrulous, though his manner 
gradually moved northward as his raiment improved, until at last when he 
had bled you until you began to learn better he was calling you quentin or 
whatever, and when you saw him next he'd be wearing a cast-off brooks 
suit and a hat with a princeton club i forget which band that someone had 
given him and which he was pleasantly and unshakably convinced was a 
part of abe lincoln's military sash. someone spread the story years ago,

      we followed the path, the two others watching julio and the little girl

us and more boys materialising from somewhere until when we turned into 
the main street we had quite a procession. before the drug store stood an 
auto, a big one, but i didn't recognise them until mrs bland said,

time," spoade said.   
     "nonsense," mrs bland said, but her voice sort of died away and she 
stared at me for a moment, and the girls drew their breaths in with a soft 
concerted sound. "fiddlesticks," mrs bland said briskly. "if that isn't just 
like these ignorant lowclass yankees. get in, quentin."   
      shreve and i sat on two small collapsible seats. gerald cranked the car 
and got in and we started.

while the dew was still on it. he wouldn't even let old wilkie touch it do 
you remember gerald but always gathered it himself and made his own

everything by a recipe in his head. there was only one man he ever gave 
that recipe to; that was   " we did how can you not know it if youll just

she moved my hand up against her throat her heart was hammering there   
poor quentin   
her face looked at the sky it was low so low that all smells and sounds of 
night seemed to have been crowded down like under a slack tent especially 
the honeysuckle it had got into my breathing it was on her face and throat 
like paint her blood pounded against my hand i was leaning on my other 
arm it began to jerk and jump and i had to pant to get any air at all out of 
that thick gray honeysuckle

you dam little slut," i says.  
      "dilsey," she says. "dilsey, i want my mother."  
      dilsey went to her. "now, now," she says. "he aint gwine so much as lay 
his hand on you while ise here." mother came on down the stairs.  
      "jason," she says. "dilsey."  
      "now, now," dilsey says. "i aint gwine let him tech you." she put her 
hand on quentin. she knocked it down.  
      "you damn old nigger," she says. she ran toward the door.  
      "dilsey," mother says on the stairs. quentin ran up the stairs, passing 
her. "quentin," mother says. "you, quentin." quentin ran on. i could hear 
her when she reached the top, then in the hall. then the door slammed.  
      mother had stopped. then she came on. "dilsey," she says.  
      "all right," dilsey says. "ise comin. you go on and git dat car and wait 
now," she says, "so you kin cahy her

      i opened her letter first and took the check out. just like a woman. six 
days late. yet they try to make men believe that they're capable of 
conducting a business. how long would a man that thought the first of the 
month came on the sixth last in business. and like as not, when they sent 
the bank statement out, she would want to know why i never deposited my 
salary until the sixth. things like that never occur to a woman.  

"i had no answer to my letter about quentin's easter dress. did it arrive all 
right? i've had no answer to the last two letters i wrote her, though the 
check in the second one was cashed with the other check. is she sick? let 
me know at once or i'll come there and see for myself. you promised you 
would let me know when she needed things. i will expect to hear from you 
before the 10th. no you'd better wire me at once. you are opening my 
letters to her. i know that as well as if i were looking at you. you'd better

ars ago he was taken sick. scared the hell out of him so 
that when he was up again he joined the church and bought himself a 
chinese missionary, five thousand dollars a year. i often think how mad 
he'll be if he was to die and find out there's not any heaven, when he thinks 
about that five thousand a year. like i say, he'd better go on and die now 
and save money.  
      when it was burned good i was just about to shove the others into my 
coat when all of a sudden something told me to open quentin's before i 
went home, but about that time earl started yelling for me up front, so i 
put them away and went and waited on the dam redneck while he spent 
fifteen minutes deciding whether he wanted a twenty cent hame string or a 
thirty-five cent one.  
      "you'd better take that good one," i says. "how do you fellows ever 
expect to get ahead, trying to work with cheap equipment?"  
      "if this one aint any good," he says, "why have you got it on sale?"  
      "i didn't say it wasn't a

      well, jason likes work. i says no i never had university advantages 
because at harvard they teach you how to go for a swim at night without 
knowing how to swim and at sewanee they dont even teach you what water 
is. i says you might send me to the state university; maybe i'll learn how to 
stop my clock with a nose spray and then you can send ben to the navy i 
says or to the cavalry anyway, they use geldings in the cavalry. then when 
she sent quentin home for me to feed too i says i guess that's right too, 
instead of me having to go way up north for a job they sent the job down 
here to me and then mother begun to cry and i says it's not that i have any 
objection to having it here; if it's any satisfaction to you i'll quit work and 
nurse it myself and let you and dilsey keep the flour barrel full, or ben. 
rent him out to a sideshow; there must be folks somewhere that would pay

      "it's so terrible to me," she says. "having the two of them like this, in 
less than two years."  
      "there, there," he says. after a while he kind of sneaked his hand to his 
mouth and dropped them out the window. then i knew what i had been 
smelling. clove stems. i reckon he thought that the least he could do at 
father's or maybe the sideboard thought it was still father and tripped him 
up when he passed. like i say, if he had to sell something to send quentin 
to harvard we'd all been a dam sight better off if he'd sold that sideboard 
and bought himself a one-armed strait jacket with part of the money. i 
reckon the reason all the compson gave out before it got to me like mother 
says, is that he drank it up. at least i never heard of him offering to sell 
anything to send me to harvard.  
      so he kept on patting her hand and saying "poor little sister", patting 
her hand with one of the black gloves that we got the bill for four days later

nothing, unless--jason compson," she says. "were you fool enough to tell--
"  
      "hush, caroline," father says, then he sent me to help dilsey get that 
old cradle out of the attic and i says,  
      "well, they brought my job home tonight" because all the time we kept 
hoping they'd get things straightened out and he'dfool keep her because 
mother kept saying she would at least have enough regard for the family 
not to jeopardise my chance after she and quentin had had theirs.  
      "and whar else do she belong?" dilsey says. "who else gwine raise her 
cep me? aint i raised ev'y one of y'all?"  

      "and a dam fine job you made of it," i says. "anyway it'll give her 
something to sure enough worry over now." so we carried the cradle down 
and dilsey started to set it up in her old room. then mother started sure 
enough.  
      "hush, miss cahline," dilsey says. "you gwine wake her up."  
      "in there?" mother says. "to be contaminated by tha

be hard enough as it is, with the heritage she already has."  
      "hush," father says. "dont be silly."  
      "why aint she gwine sleep in here," dilsey says. "in the same room 
whar i put her maw to bed ev'y night of her life since she was big enough to 
sleep by herself."  
      "you dont know," mother says. "to have my own daughter cast off by 
her husband. poor little innocent baby," she says, looking at quentin. "you 
will never know the suffering you've caused."  
      "hush, caroline," father says.  
      "what you want to go on like that fo jason fer?" dilsey says.  
      "i've tried to protect him," mother says. "i've always tried to protect him 
from it. at least i can do my best to shield her."  
      "how sleepin in dis room gwine hurt her, i like to know," dilsey says.  
      "i cant help it," mother says. "i know i'm just a troublesome old 
woman. but i know that people cannot flout god'

happy to give the rest of my life to her, if i can just prevent--"  
      "hush, now," dilsey says. "we gwine take keer of her. en you go on to 
bed too," she says to me. "you got to go to school tomorrow."  
      so i went out, then mother called me back and cried on me a while.  
      "you are my only hope," she says. "every night i thank god for you." 
while we were waiting there for them to start she says thank god if he had 
to be taken too, it is you left me and not quentin. thank god you are not a 
compson, because all i have left now is you and maury and i says, well i 
could spare uncle maury myself. well, he kept on patting her hand with 
his black glove, talking away from her. he took them off when his turn with 
the shovel came. he got up near the first, where they were holding the 
umbrellas over them, stamping every now and then and trying to kick the 
mud off their feet and sticking to the shovels so they'd have to knock it off, 
making a hollow sound whe

 there, standing there in a black cloak, looking at the 
flowers. i knew who it was right off, before she turned and looked at me 
and lifted up her veil.  
      "hello, jason," she says, holding out her hand. we shook hands.  
      "what are you doing here?" i says. "i thought you promised her you 
wouldn't come back here. i thought you had more sense than that."  
      "yes?" she says. she looked at the flowers again. there must have been 
fifty dollars' worth. somebody had put one bunch on quentin's. "you did?" 
she says.  
      "i'm not surprised though," i says. "i wouldn't put anything past you. 

you dont mind anybody. you dont give a dam about anybody."  
      "oh," she says, "that job." she looked at the grave. "i'm sorry about that, 
jason."  
      "i bet you are," i says. "you'll talk mighty meek now. but you needn't 
have come back. there's not anything left. ask uncle maury, if you dont 
believe me."  
      "i dont want anything," she says. she looked at the grave. "why di

the way he left me to come home in the rain by myself. i says,  
      "a fine lot you care, sneaking in here soon as he's dead. but it wont do 
you any good. dont think that you can take advantage of this to come 
sneaking back. if you cant stay on the horse you've got, you'll have to walk," 
i says. "we dont even know your name at that house," i says. "do you know 
that? we dont even know your name. you'd be better off if you were down 
there with him and quentin," i says. "do you know that?"  
      "i know it," she says. "jason," she says, looking at the grave, "if you'll fix 
it so i can see her a minute i'll give you fifty dollars."  
      "you haven't got fifty dollars," i says.  
      "will you?" she says, not looking at me.  
      "let's see it," i says. "i dont believe you've got fifty dollars."  
      i could see where her hands were moving under her cloak, then she 
held her hand out. dam if it wasn't full of money. i could see two or thre

to be taken, thank god it was you left me i can depend on you and i says 
well i dont reckon i'll ever get far enough from the store to get out of your 
reach. somebody's got to hold on to what little we have left, i reckon.  
      so as soon as i got home i fixed dilsey. i told dilsey she had leprosy and 
i got the bible and read where a man's flesh rotted off and i told her that if 
she ever looked at her or ben or quentin they'd catch it too. so i thought i 
had everything all fixed until that day when i came home and found ben 
bellowing. raising hell and nobody could quiet him. mother said, well, get 
him the slipper then. dilsey made out she didn't hear. mother said it again 
and i says i'd go i couldn't stand that dam noise. like i say i can stand lots 
of things i dont expect much from them but if i have to work all day long in 
a dam store dam if i dont think i deserve a little peace and quiet to eat

for?"  
      "you's a cold man, jason, if man you is," she says. "i thank de lawd i 
got mo heart den cat, even ef hit is black."  
      "at least i'm man enough to keep that flour barrel full," i says. "and if 
you do that again, you wont be eating out of it either."  
      so the next time i told her that if she tried dilsey again, mother was 
going to fire dilsey and send ben to jackson and take quentin and go 
away. she looked at me for a while. there wasn't any street light close and i 

couldn't see her face much. but i could feel her looking at me. when we 
were little when she'd get mad and couldn't do anything about it her upper 
lip would begin to jump. everytime it jumped it would leave a little more of 
her teeth showing, and all the time she'd be as still as a post, not a muscle 
moving except her lip jerking higher and higher up her teeth. but she 
didn't say anything. she just sai

      i never found a nigger yet that didn't have an airtight alibi for whatever 
he did. but just turn one loose in a car and he's bound to show off. i got in 
and went on around the square. i caught a glimpse of earl in the door 
across the square.  
      i went straight to the kitchen and told dilsey to hurry up with dinner.  
      "quentin aint come yit," she says.  
      "what of that?" i says. "you'll be telling me next that luster's not quite 
ready to eat yet. quentin knows when meals are served in this house. 
hurry up with it, now."  

      mother was in her room. i gave her the letter. she opened it and took 
the check out and sat holding it in her hand. i went and got the shovel from 
the corner and gave her a match. "come on," i says. "get it over with. you'll 
be crying in a minute."  
      she took the match, but she didn't strike it. she sat there, looking at the 
check. just like i said it would be.  
      "i hate to do it," she says. "to increa

      she struck the match and lit the check and put it in the shovel, and then 
the envelope, and watched them burn.  
      "you dont know what it is," she says. "thank god you will never know 
what a mother feels."  
      "there are lots of women in this world no better than her," i says.  
      "but they are not my daughters," she says. "it's not myself," she says. 
"i'd gladly take her back, sins and all, because she is my flesh and blood. 
it's for quentin's sake."  
      well, i could have said it wasn't much chance of anybody hurting 
quentin much, but like i say i dont expect much but i do want to eat and 
sleep without a couple of women squabbling and crying in the house.  
      "and yours," she says. "i know how you feel toward her."  
      "let her come back," i says, "far as i'm concerned."  
      "no," she says. "i owe that to your father's memory."  
      "when he was trying all the time to persuade you to let her come home

shame to me to burn up good money," i says.  
      "let me never see the day when my children will have to accept that, the 
wages of sin," she says. "i'd rather see even you dead in your coffin first."  
      "have it your way," i says. "are we going to have dinner soon?" i says. 
"because if we're not, i'll have to go on back. we're pretty busy today." she 
got up. "i've told her once," i says. "it seems she's waiting on quentin or 
luster or somebody. here, i'll call her. wait." but she went to the head of 
the stairs and called.  
      "quentin aint come yit," dilsey says.  
      "well, i'll have to get on back," i says. "i can get a sandwich downtown. 
i dont want to interfere with dilsey's arrangements," i says. well, that got 
her started again, with dilsey hobbling and mumbling back and forth, 
saying,

not let me know you're gone because i'll sure have him on number 
seventeen that night and i says i think i know a place where they'll take her 
too and the name of it's not milk street and honey avenue either. then she 
begun to cry and i says all right all right i have as much pride about my 
kinfolks as anybody even if i dont always know where they come from.  
      we ate for a while. mother sent dilsey to the front to look for quentin 
again.  
      "i keep telling you she's not coming to dinner," i says.  
      "she knows better than that," mother says. "she knows i dont permit 

her to run about the streets and not come home at meal time. did you look 
good, dilsey?"  
      "dont let her, then," i says.  
      "what can i do," she says. "you have all of you flouted me. always."  
      "if you wouldn't come interfering, i'd make her mind," i says. "it 
wouldn't take me but about one day to straighten her out."

and if they didn't it was dam little of my business anyway and he says, "my

any claim on this business can go back there and welcome."  
      "sure, you wont tell," i says. "you couldn't square your conscience with 
that. you'll just take her back there and let her find it. you wont tell, 
yourself."  
      "i'm not trying to meddle in your business," he says. "i know you 
missed out on some things like quentin had. but your mother has had a 
misfortunate life too, and if she was to come in here and ask me why you 
quit, i'd have to tell her. it aint that thousand dollars. you know that. it's 
because a man never gets anywhere if fact and his ledgers dont square. and 
i'm not going to lie to anybody, for myself or anybody else."  
      "well, then," i says. "i reckon that conscience of yours is a more 
valuable clerk than i am; it dont have to go home at noon to eat. only dont

      "you dont have to stay here," i says. "you could spend the whole day 
visiting like other women, if you wanted to." she came to the door.

your dinner like you did."  
      "better luck next time," i says. "what do you want?"  
      "is anything wrong?" she says.  
      "what could be?" i says. "cant i come home in the middle of the 
afternoon without upsetting the whole house?"  
      "have you seen quentin?" she says.  
      "she's in school," i says.  
      "it's after three," she says. "i heard the clock strike at least a half an 
hour ago. she ought to be home by now."  
      "ought she?" i says. "when have you ever seen her before dark?"  
      "she ought to be home," she says. "when i was a girl--"  
      "you had somebody to make you behave yourself," i says. "she hasn't."

of that. i says i know what you need you need what they did to ben then 
you'd behave. and if you dont know what that was i says, ask dilsey to tell 
you.  
      there was a light in mother's room. i put the car up and went on into 
the kitchen. luster and ben were there.  
      "where's dilsey?" i says. "putting supper on?"  
      "she up stairs wid miss cahline," luster says. "dey been goin hit. ever

      "if mother is any sicker than she was when she came down to dinner, all 
right," i says. "but as long as i am buying come down to the table to eat it. 
let me know when supper's ready," i says, reading the paper again. i heard 
her climbing the stairs, dragging her feet and grunting and groaning like 
they were straight up and three feet apart. i heard her at mother's door, 
then i heard her calling quentin, like the door was locked, then she went 
back to mother's room and then mother went and talked to quentin. then 
they came down stairs. i read the paper.  
      dilsey came back to the door. "come on," she says, "fo you kin think up 
some mo devilment. you just tryin yoself tonight."  
      i went to the diningroom. quentin was sitting with her head bent. she 
had painted her face again. her nose looked like a porcelain insulator.

to mother.  
      "it's little enough i can do for you, to come to the table," she says. "no 
matter how i feel. i realise that when a man works all day he likes to be 
surrounded by his family at the supper table. i want to please you. i only 
wish you and quentin got along better. it would be easier for me."  
      "we get along all right," i says. "i dont mind her staying locked up in 

her room all day if she wants to. but i cant have all this whoop-de-do and 
sulking at mealtimes. i know that's a lot to ask her, but i'm that way in my 
own house. your house, i meant to say."  
      "it's yours," mother says. "you are the head of it now."  
      quentin hadn't looked up. i helped the plates and she begun to eat.

      "is your headache gone?" mother says.  
      "headache?" i says.  
      "i was afraid you were developing one," she says. "when you came in 
this afternoon."  
      "oh," i says. "no, it didn't show up. we stayed so busy this afternoon i 
forgot about it."  
      "was that why you were late?" mother says. i could see quentin 
listening. i looked at her. her knife and fork were still going, but i caught 
her looking at me, then she looked at her plate again. i says,  
      "no. i loaned my car to a fellow about three oclock and i had to wait 
until he got back with it." i ate for a while.  
      "who was it?" mother says.  
      "it was one of those show men," i says. "it seems his sister's husband 
was out riding with some town woman, and he was chasing them."  
      quentin sat perfectly still, chewing.

  "you ought not to lend your car to people like that," mother says. "you 
are too generous with it. that's why i never call on you for it if i can help 
it."  
      "i was beginning to think that myself, for a while," i says. "but he got 
back, all right. he says he found what he was looking for."  

      "who was the woman?" mother says.  
      "i'll tell you later," i says. "i dont like to talk about such things before 
quentin." quentin had quit eating. every once in a while she'd take a drink 
of water, then she'd sit there crumbling a biscuit up, her face bent over her 
plate.  
      "yes," mother says. "i suppose women who stay shut up like i do have 
no idea what goes on in this town."  
      "yes," i says. "they dont."  
      "my life has been so different from that," mother says. "thank god i 
dont know about such wickedness. i dont even want to know about it. i'm 
not like most people."  
      i didn't say any more.

 quentin sat there, crumbling the biscuit until i

      "what?" i says. "sure, you can go. were you waiting on us?"  
      she looked at me. she had crumpled all the bread, but her hands still 
went on like they were crumpling it yet and her eyes looked like they were 
cornered or something and then she started biting her mouth like it ought 
to have poisoned her, with all that red lead.

      "she didn't go to school today," she says. "i just know she didn't. she 
says she went for a car ride with one of the boys this afternoon and you 
followed her."  
      "how could i," i says. "when somebody had my car all afternoon? 
whether or not she was in school today is already past," i says. "if you've 
got to worry about it, worry about next monday."  
      "i wanted you and she to get along with one another," she says. "but she 
has inherited all of the headstrong traits. quentin's too. i thought at the 
time, with the heritage she would already have, to give her that name, too. 
sometimes i think she is the judgment of both of them upon me." "good

her and quentin. they were always conspiring against me. against you too, 
though you were too young to realise it. they always looked on you and me 
as outsiders, like they did your uncle maury. i always told your father that 
they were allowed too much freedom, to be together too much. when 
quentin started to school we had to let her go the next year, so she could be 
with him. she couldn't bear for any of you to do anything she couldn't. it 
was vanity in her, vanity and false pride. and then when her trou

offered to take you into the bank i said, jason is provided for now, and 
when all the expense began to pile up and i was forced to sell our furniture 
and the rest of the pasture, i wrote her at once because i said she will 
realise that she and quentin have had their share and part of jason's too 
and that it depends on her now to compensate him. i said she will do that 
out of respect for her father. i believed that, then. but i'm just a poor old

went to the kitchen. the fire had died down. there was no sound in the 
house. she put on the apron and went up stairs. there was no sound 
anywhere. quentin's room was as they had left it. she entered and picked 
up the undergarment and put the stocking back in the drawer and closed it. 
mrs compson's door was closed. dilsey stood beside it for a moment, 
listening. then she opened it and entered, entered a pervading reek of 
camphor. the shades were drawn, the room in halflight, and the bed, so 
that at first she thought mrs compson was asleep and was about to close 
the door when the other spoke.

of fortitude, strength. in her case it was an unshakable conviction 
regarding the yet unplumbed event. "well," she said presently. "did you

     "find whut? whut you talkin about?"
