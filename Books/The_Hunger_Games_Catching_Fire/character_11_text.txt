s i can, it takes me about an hour to get a 
fire going. i look up with a triumphant smile only to find i have company. 

the  two  tributes  from  district  3  are  beside  me,  struggling  to  start  a  decent  fire  with 
matches. i think about leaving, but i really want to try using the flint again, and if i have to 
report back to haymitch that i tried to make  friends, these two might be a  bearable choice. 
both  are  small  in  stature  with  ashen  skin  and  black  hair.  the  woman,  wiress,  is  probably 
around my mother's age and speaks in a quiet, intelligent voice. but right away i notice she 
has  a  habit  of  dropping  off  her  words  in  mid-sentence,  as  if  she's  forgotten  you're  there. 
beetee, the  man,  is  older  and  somewhat  fidgety.  he  wears  glasses  but  spends  a  lot of  time 
looking under them. they're a little strange, but i'm pretty sure neither of them is going to try 
to make me uncomfortable by stripping naked. and they're from district 3. mayb

faces with bright pink swirls. the male tribute from district 5 is vomiting wine on the sword-
fighting  floor.  finnick  and  the  old  woman  from  his  district  are  using  the  archery  station. 
johanna  mason  is  naked  again  and  oiling  her  skin  down  for  a  wrestling  lesson.  i  decide  to 
stay put. 

wiress and beetee  make decent company. they  seem  friendly enough  but don't pry. we 
talk about our talents; they tell me they both invent things, which makes my supposed interest 
in fashion seem pretty weak. wiress brings up some sort of stitching device she's working on. 

â€œit senses the density of the  fabric and selects the strength,â€ she  says, and then  becomes 

absorbed in a bit of dry straw before she can go on.

production, this year?â€ he asks. 

â€œno. well, we lost a couple of weeks when they brought in a new head peacekeeper and 
his crew, but nothing major,â€ i say. â€œto production, i mean. two weeks sitting around your 
house doing nothing just means two weeks of being hungry for most people.â€ 

i think they understand what i'm trying to say. that we've had no uprising. â€œoh. that's a 
shame,â€ says wiress in a slightly disappointed voice. â€œi found your district very ...â€ she trails 
off, distracted by something in her head. 

â€œinteresting,â€ fills in beetee. â€œwe both did.â€ 

i  feel  bad,  knowing  that their  district  must  have  suffered  much  worse  than  ours.  i  feel  i 
have to defend  my people. â€œwell, there aren't very  many of us  in twelve,â€ i say.  â€œnot that 
you'd know it nowadays by the size of the peacekeeping force. but i guess we're interesting 
enough.â€

gamemakers  are  roaming  around,  eating  and  drinking,  sometimes  taking  notice  of  us. 
â€œlook,â€ she says, giving her head a slight nod in their direction. i look up and see plutarch 
heavensbee in the magnificent purple robe with the fur-trimmed collar that designates him as 
head gamemaker. he's eating a turkey leg. 

i  don't  see  why  this  merits  comment,  but  i  say,  â€œyes,  he's  been  promoted  to  head

â€œno, no. there by the corner of the table. you can just ...â€ says wiress. 

beetee squints under his glasses. â€œjust make it out.â€ 

i  stare  in  that  direction,  perplexed.  but  then  i  see  it.  a  patch  of  space  about  six  inches 
square at the corner of the table seems almost to be  vibrating. it's as  if the air  is rippling  in 
tiny visible waves, distorting the sharp edges of the wood and a goblet of wine someone has 
set there. 

â€œa  force  field.  they've  set  one  up  between  the  game-makers  and  us.  i  wonder  what 

brought that on,â€

 beetee says. 

â€œme, probably,â€ i confess. â€œlast year i shot an arrow at them during my private training 
session.â€  beetee  and  wiress  look  at  me  curiously.  â€œi  was  provoked.  so,  do  all  force  fields 
have a spot like that?â€ 

â€œchink,â€ says wiress vaguely. 

â€œin the armor, as it were,â€ finishes beetee. â€œideally it'd be invisible, wouldn't it?â€ 

i want to ask them more, but lunch is announced. i look for peeta, but he's hanging with a 
group of about ten other victors, so i decide just to eat with district 3. maybe i can get seeder 
to join us. 

when we make our way into the dining area, i see some of peeta's gang have other ideas. 
they're  dragging  all  the  smaller  tables  to  form  one  large  table  so  that  we  all  hav

i  take  a  tray  and  start  making  my  way  around  the  food-laden  carts  that  ring  the  room. 

peeta catches up with me at the stew. â€œhow's it going?â€ 

â€œgood. fine. i like the district three victors,â€ i say. â€œwiress and beetee.â€ 

â€œreally?â€ he asks. â€œthey're something of a joke to the others.â€ 

â€œwhy  does that not surprise  me?â€ i say. i think  of  how peeta was always  surrounded at 
school by a crowd of friends. it's amazing, really, that he ever took any notice of me except to 
think i was odd. 

â€œjohanna's nicknamed them nuts and volts,â€ he says. â€œi think she's nuts and he's volts.â€ 

â€œand  so  i'm  stupid  for  thinking  they  might  be  useful.  because  of  something  johann

â€œactually i think the nickname's been around for years. and i didn't mean that as an insult.

â€œwell,  wiress  and  beetee  are  smart.  they  invent  things.  they  could  tell  by  sight  that  a 
force field had been put up between us and the gamemakers. and if we have to have allies, i 
want them.â€ i toss the ladle back in a pot of stew, splattering us both with the gravy. 

â€œwhat are you so angry about?â€ peeta asks, wiping the gravy from his shirtfront. â€œbecause

their sorrow. their loss. i turn spontaneously to chaff and offer my hand. i feel my fingers 
close around the stump that now completes his arm and hold fast. 

and  then  it  happens.  up  and  down  the  row, the  victors  begin  to  join  hands.  some  right 
away, like the morphlings, or wiress and beetee. others unsure but caught up in the demands 
of those around them, like brutus and enobaria. by the time the anthem plays its final strains, 
all twenty-four of us stand in one unbroken line in what must be the first public show of unity 
among  the  districts  since  the  dark  days.  you  can  see  the  realization  of  this  as  the  screens 
begin  to  pop  into  blackness.  it's  too  late, though.  in  the  confusion  they  didn't  cut  us  off  in

in the waves but managing to keep his head above water. 

â€œwhat?â€ i say. 

â€œthe belts. they're flotation devices,â€ says finnick. â€œi mean, you have to propel yourself, 

but they'll keep you from drowning.â€ 

i almost ask finnick to wait, to get beetee and wiress and take them with us, but beetee's 
three  spokes  over  and  i  can't  even  see  wiress.  for  all  i  know,  finnick  would  kill  them  as 
quickly as he did the tribute from 5, so instead i suggest we move on. i hand peeta a bow, a 
sheath of arrows, and a knife, keeping the rest for myself. but mags tugs on my sleeve and

air. at first i think it's the glare from the sun or the heat shimmering up off the ground. but 
it's  fixed  in  space,  not  shifting  when  i  move.  and  that's  when  i  connect  the  square  with 
wiress and beetee in the training center and realize what lies before us. my warning cry is 
just reaching my lips when peeta's knife swings out to slash away some vines. 

there's a sharp zapping sound. for an instant, the trees are gone and i see open space over 
a short stretch of  bare earth. then peeta's  flung  back  from the  force  field, bringing  finnick 
and mags to the ground. 

i rush over to where he lies, motionless in a web of vines. â€œpeeta?â€ there's a faint smell of 
singed hair.

peeta starts to object but finnick cuts him off. â€œno, let her do it.â€ he frowns at me. â€œyou

i  hesitate.  to  reveal  that  i  know  beetee  and  wiress's  trick  of  recognizing  a  force  field

training  when  the  two  pointed  it  out  to  me  or  not.  one  way  or  the  other,  i  have  a  very

of the jungle is tinged a uniform pink. and i think i can make out one or two of those wavy 
squares, chinks  in the armor, wiress and beetee called them, because they reveal what was 
meant  to  be  hidden  and  are  therefore  a  weakness.  just  to  make  absolutely  sure,  i  shoot  an

the sky brightens when the seal of the capitol appears as if floating in space. as i listen to 
the strains of the anthem i think, it will be harder for finnick and mags. but it turns out to be 
plenty hard for me as well. seeing the faces of the eight dead victors projected into the sky. 

the  man  from district 5, the one finnick took out with his trident, is the  first to  appear. 
that  means  that  all  the  tributes  in  1  through  4  are  alive  â€”  the  four  careers,  beetee  and 
wiress, and, of course, mags and finnick. the man from district 5 is followed by the male 
morphling  from 6, cecelia and  woof  from 8, both  from 9, the woman  from 10, and seeder 
from 11. the capitol seal is back with a final bit of music and then the sky goes dark except 
for the moon. 

no one speaks. i can't pretend i knew  any of them well. but i'm thinking of those three 
kids hanging on to cecelia when they took her away. seeder's kindness to me at our meeting.

i wipe the sweat from my eyes and hold the gift out in  the moonlight. i move it this way 
and that, viewing it from different angles, covering portions and then revealing them. trying 
to make it divulge its purpose to me. finally, in frustration, i jam one end into the dirt. â€œi give 
up. maybe if we hook up with beetee or wiress they can figure it out. 

i stretch out, pressing my hot cheek on the grass mat, staring at the thing in aggravation. 
peeta rubs a tense spot between my shoulders and i let myself relax a little. i wonder why this 
place  hasn't cooled off at all  now that the sun's gone down. i wonder what's going on  back 
home.

they're at home. not taken into custody by thread. being punished as cinna is. as darius is.

ck!â€ i hear johanna's voice reply. 

i exchange a look with peeta. â€œwhat now?â€ i ask. 

â€œwe can't really leave finnick,â€ he says. 

â€œguess  not.  come  on,  then,â€  i  say  grouchily,  because  even  if  i'd  had  a  list  of  allies, 
johanna mason would definitely not have been on it. the two of us tromp down the beach to 
where finnick and johanna are just meeting up. as we move in closer, i see her companions, 
and confusion sets in. that's beetee on the ground on his back and wiress who's regained her 
feet to continue making loops. â€œshe's got wiress and beetee.â€ 

â€œnuts and volts?â€ says peeta, equally puzzled. â€œi've got to hear how this happened.â€ 

when  we  reach  them,  johanna's  gesturing  toward  the  jungle  and  talking  very  fast  to 
finnick.  â€œwe  thought  it  was  rain,  you  know,  because  of  the  lightning,  and  we  were  all  so 
thirsty.  but  when  it  started  coming  down,  it  turned  out to  be  blood.  thick,  hot  blood.  you

of it, i don't even think he showed up for training. 

â€œyeah,  well,  he  wasn't  much,  but  he  was  from  home,â€  she  says.  â€œand  he  left  me  alone 
with these two.â€ she nudges beetee, who's barely conscious, with her shoe. â€œhe got a knife 
in the back at the cornucopia. and herâ€”â€ 

we all look over at wiress, who's circling around, coated in dried blood, and murmuring, 

â€œtick, tock. tick, tock.â€ 

â€œyeah, we know. tick, tock. nuts is in shock,â€ says johanna. this seems to draw wiress 
in her direction and she careens into johanna, who harshly shoves her to the beach. â€œjust stay 
down, will you?â€ 

â€œlay off her,â€ i snap. 

johanna  narrows  her  brown  eyes  at  me  in  hatred.  â€œlay  off  her?â€  she  hisses.  she  steps 
forward before i can react and slaps me so hard i see star

she screams a lot of really 
insulting things at me. but i don't shoot. because she's with finnick and because of what she 
said, about getting them for me. 

â€œwhat did she mean? she got them for me?â€ i ask peeta. 

â€œi don't know. you did want them originally,â€ he reminds me. 

â€œyeah,  i  did.  originally.â€  but  that  answers  nothing.  i  look  down  at  beetee's  inert  body. 

â€œbut i won't have them long unless we do something.â€ 

peeta lifts beetee up in his arms and i take wiress by the hand and we go back to our little 
beach camp. i sit wiress in the shallows so she can get washed up a bit, but she just clutches 
her hands together and occasionally mumbles, â€œtick, tock.â€ i unhook beetee's belt and find a 
heavy metal cylinder attached to the side with a rope of vines. i can't tell what it is,  but if he 
thought it was worth saving, i'm not going to be the one who loses it. i toss it up on the sand.

then pull him into the shade at the edge of the jungle. 

â€œi think that's all we can do,â€ i say. 

â€œit's good. you're good with this healing stuff,â€ he says. â€œit's in your blood.â€ 

â€œno,â€ i say, shaking my head. â€œi got my father's blood.â€ the kind that quickens during a 

hunt, not an epidemic. â€œi'm going to see about wiress.â€ 

i take a handful of the  moss to use as a rag and  join  wiress  in the shallows. she doesn't 
resist as i work off her clothing, scrub the blood from her skin. but her eyes are dilated with 
fear,  and  when  i  speak,  she  doesn't  respond  except  to  say  with  ever-increasing  urgency, 
â€œtick, tock.â€ she does seem to be trying to tell me something, but with no beetee to explain 
her thoughts, i'm at a loss. 

â€œyes, tick, tock. tick, tock,â€ i say. this seems to calm  her down

jumpsuit until there's hardly a trace of blood, and help her back into it. it's not damaged like 
ours were. her belt's fine, so i fasten that on, too. then i pin her undergarments, along with 
beetee's, under some rocks and let them soak. 

by the time i've rinsed out beetee's jumpsuit, a shiny clean johanna and peeling finnick 
have joined us. for a while, johanna gulps water and stuffs herself with shellfish while i try 
to  coax  something  into  wiress.  finnick  tells  about the  fog  and  the  monkeys  in  a  detached, 
almost clinical voice, avoiding the most important detail of the story. 

everybody offers to guard while the others rest, but in the end, it's johanna and i who stay 
up. me because i'm really rested, she because she simply refuses to lie down. the two of us 
sit in silence on the beach until the others have gone to sleep. 

johanna glances over at finnick, to be sure, then turns to me. â€œhow'd you lose mags?â€

no, i think. but i nod my head in assent. â€œthanks. i appreciate it.â€ 

â€œi hope so.â€ she gives me a look filled with loathing, like i'm the biggest drag possible on 

her life. i wonder if this is what it's like to have an older sister who really hates you. 

â€œtick,  tock,â€  i  hear  behind  me.  i  turn  and  see  wiress  has  crawled  over.  her  eyes  are 

focused on the jungle. 

â€œoh,  goody,  she's  back.  okay,  i'm  going  to  sleep.  you  and  nuts  can  guard  together,â€ 

johanna says. she goes over and flings herself down beside finnick.

her arm to soothe her. she drifts off, stirring restlessly, occasionally sighing out her phrase.

that it matters. across the water, off to the right, i see the enormous flash as the lightning bolt 
hits  the  tree  and  the  electrical  storm  begins  again.  right  in  the  same  area  it  did  last  night. 
someone must have moved into its range, triggered the attack. i sit for a while watching the 
lightning, keeping wiress calm, lulled into a sort of peacefulness by the lapping of the water. 
i think of last night, how the lightning began just after the bell tolled. twelve bongs.

in the third section, right next to that, when the fog appeared. and as soon as it was sucked 
away, the monkeys began to gather in the fourth. tick, tock. my head snaps to the other side. 
a couple of hours ago, at around ten, that wave came out of the second section to the left of 
where the lightning strikes now. at noon. at midnight. at noon.

just to the right of it, her words suddenly make sense.

too  close  to  the  fog  for  my  liking.  do  the  various  attacks  stay  within  the  confines  of  the 
jungle? not necessarily. the wave didn't. if that fog leaches out of the jungle, or the monkeys 
return ...

to liking anything i suggest. but even she agrees it's better to be safe than sorry. 

while the others collect our few possessions and get beetee back into his jumpsuit, i rouse 

wiress. she awakes with a panicked â€œtick, tock!â€

thought it would help me as a mentor. or maybe this had been the plan all along.

the  nearby  jungle.  â€œso  we  have  to  move  somewhere  safe  now.â€  she  smiles  and  stands  up

beetee's still pretty out of it, but when peeta tries to lift him, he objects. â€œwire,â€ he says. 

â€œshe's right here,â€ peeta tells him. â€œwiress is fine. she's coming, too.â€ 

but still beetee struggles. â€œwire,â€ he insists. 

â€œoh, i know what he wants,â€ says  johanna  impatiently. she crosses the  beach and picks 
up the cylinder we took from his belt when we were bathing him. it's coated in a thick layer 
of congealed blood. â€œthis worthless thing. it's some kind of wire or something. that's how he 
got  cut.  running  up  to  the  cornucopia  to  get  this.  i  don't  know  what  kind  of  weapon  it's 
supposed to be. i g

ul where we step,â€ says finnick, shooting me a look. he 
takes the coil and sets it on beetee's chest. â€œthere's your wire, volts. watch where you plug 
it.â€ 

peeta picks up the now-unresisting beetee. â€œwhere to?â€ 

â€œi'd like to go to the cornucopia and watch. just to make sure we're right about the clock,â€ 
says  finnick. it seems as good a plan as any. besides, i wouldn't  mind the chance of going 
over the weapons again. and there are six of us now. even if you count beetee and wiress 
out,  we've  got  four  good  fighters.  it's  so  different  from  where  i  was  last  year  at  this  point, 
doing  everything  on  my  own.  yes,  it's  great  to  have  allies  as  long  as  you  can  ignore  the 
thought that you'll have to kill them. 

beetee  and  wiress  will  probably  find  some  way  to  die  on  their  own.  if  we  have  to  run 
from something, how far would they get? johanna, frankly, i could easily kill if it came down 
to protecting peeta. or maybe even just

een-year-old  girl,  i  guess,  but  very 
satisfying. 

we walk down the nearest sand strip, approaching the cornucopia with care, just in case 
the careers are concealed there. i doubt they are, because we've been on the beach for hours 
and  there's  been  no  sign  of  life.  the  area's  abandoned,  as  i  expected.  only  the  big  golden 
horn and the picked-over pile of weapons remain. 

when  peeta  lays  beetee  in  the  bit  of  shade  the  cornucopia  provides,  he  calls  out  to 
wiress.  she  crouches  beside  him  and  he  puts  the  coil  of  wire  in  her  hands.  â€œclean  it,  will 
you?â€ he asks. 

wiress nods and scampers over to the water's edge, where she dunks the coil in the water. 
she starts quietly singing some funny little song, about a mouse running up a clock. it must 
be for children, but it seems to make her happy. 

â€œoh, not the song again,â€ says johanna, rolling her eyes. â€œthat went on for hours before 

she started tick-tocking.â€ 

suddenly wir

ess stands up very straight and points to the jungle. â€œtwo,â€ she says. 

i  follow  her  finger  to  where  the  wall  of  fog  has  just  begun  to  seep  out  onto  the  beach. 

â€œyes, look, wiress is right. it's two o'clock and the fog has started.â€ 

â€œlike clockwork,â€ says peeta. â€œyou were very smart to figure that out, wiress.â€ 

wiress smiles and goes back to singing and dunking her coil. â€œoh, she's more than smart,â€ 
says beetee. â€œshe's intuitive.â€ we all turn to look at beetee, who seems to be coming back to 
life. â€œshe can sense things before anyone else. like a canary in one of your coal mines.â€ 

â€œwhat's that?â€ finnick asks me. 

â€œit's a bird that we take down into the mines to warn us if there's bad air,â€ i say. 

â€œwhat's it do, die?â€ asks johanna. 

â€œit stops singing first. that's when you sho

on't want to talk about dying songbirds. they  bring up thoughts of  my 
father's  death  and  rue's  death  and  maysilee  donner's  death  and  my  mother  inheriting  her 
songbird.  oh,  great,  and  now  i'm  thinking  of  gale,  deep  down  in  that  horrible  mine,  with 
president snow's threat hanging over his head. so easy to make it look like an accident down 
there. a silent canary, a spark, and nothing more. 

i go back to imagining killing the president. 

despite her annoyance at wiress, johanna's as happy as i've seen her in the arena. while 
i'm adding to my stock of arrows, she pokes around until she comes up with a pair of lethal-
looking axes. it seems an odd choice until i see her throw one with such force it sticks in the 
sun-softened  gold  of  the  cornucopia.  of  course.  johanna  mason.  district  7.  lumber.  i  bet 
she's  been  tossing  around  axes  since  she  could  toddle.  it's  like  finnick  with  his  trident.  or 
beetee  with  his  wire.  rue  with  h

â€œi'm going to mark the ones where we know the gamemakers' weapon follows us out past 
the  jungle,  so  we'll  stay  clear  of  those,â€  says  peeta,  drawing  diagonal  lines  on  the  fog  and 
wave beaches. then he sits back. â€œwell, it's a lot more than we knew this morning, anyway.â€ 

we all nod in agreement, and that's when i  notice it. the silence. our canary has stopped 

singing. 

i don't wait. i load an arrow as i twist and get a  glimpse of a dripping-wet gloss  letting 
wiress slide to the ground, her throat slit open in a bright red smile. the point of my arrow 
disappears into his right temple, and in the instant it takes to reload, johanna has buried an ax 
blade  in  cashmere's  chest.  finnick  knocks  away  a  spear  brutus  throws  at  peeta  and  takes 
enobaria's  knife  in  his  thigh.  if  there  wasn't  a  cornucopia  to  duck  behind,  they'd  be  dead, 
both  of  the  tributes  from  district  2.  i  spring  forward  in  pursuit. boom!  boom!  boom! the

cannon confirms there's no way to help wiress, no need to finish off gloss or cashmere. my 
allies  and  i  are  rounding  the  horn,  starting  to  give  chase  to  brutus  and  enobaria,  who  are 
sprinting down a sand strip toward the jungle. 

suddenly  the  ground  jerks  beneath  my  feet  and  i'm  flung  on  my  side  in  the  sand.  the 
circle  of  land  that  holds  the  cornucopia  starts  spinning  fast,  really  fast,  and  i  can  see  the 
jungle going by in a blur. i feel the centrifugal force pulling me toward the water

 dig my 
hands and feet into the sand, trying to get some purchase on the unstable ground. between the 
flying sand and the dizziness, i have to squeeze my eyes shut. there is literally nothing i can 
do but hold on until, with no deceleration, we slam to a stop. 

coughing  and  queasy,  i  sit  up  slowly  to  find  my  companions  in  the  same  condition. 
finnick, johanna, and peeta have hung on. the three dead bodies have been tossed out into 
the seawater. 

the whole thing, from missing wiress's song to now, can't have taken more than a minute 

or two. we sit there panting, scraping the sand out of our mouths. 

â€œwhere's volts?â€  says  johanna.  we're on our feet. one wobbly  circle of the cornucopia 
confirms  he's  gone.  finnick  spots  him  about twenty  yards  out  in  the  water,  barely  keeping 
afloat, and swims out to haul him in. 

that's  when  i  remember  the  wire  and  how  important  it  was  to  him.  i  look  frantically 
around. where is it? where is it? and

then i see it, still clutched in wiress's hands, far out in 
the water. my stomach contracts at the thought of what i must do next. â€œcover me,â€ i say to 
the  others.  i  toss  aside  my  weapons  and  race  down  the  strip  closest  to  her  body.  without 
slowing down, i dive into the water and start for her. out of the corner of my eye, i can see 
the hovercraft appearing over us, the claw starting to  descend to take her away. but i don't

ng  out  water.  he  had  the  good  sense  to  hang  on  to  his 
glasses, so at least he can see. i place the reel of wire on his lap. it's sparkling clean, no blood 
left at all. he unravels a piece of the wire and runs it through his fingers. for the first time i 
see  it, and  it's unlike any wire i know. a pale golden color and as  fine as a piece of  hair. i 
wonder how long it is. there must be miles of the stuff to fill the large spool. but i don't ask, 
because i know he's thinking of wiress. 

i  look  at  the  others'  sober  faces.  now  finnick,  johanna,  and  beetee  have  all  lost  their 
district partners. i cross to peeta and wrap my arms around him, and for a while we all stay 
silent. 

â€œlet's  get  off  this  stinking  island,â€  johanna  says  finally.  there's  only  the  matter  of  our 
weapons  now,  which  we've  largely  retained.  fortunately  the  vines  here  are  strong  and  the 
spile  and  tube  of  medicine  wrapped  in  the  parachute  are  still  se

ow where we are on the clock face again. 

finnick weaves yet another water basket and a net for fishing. i take a quick swim and put 
more  ointment  on  my  skin.  then  i  sit  at  the  edge  of  the  water,  cleaning  the  fish  finnick 
catches and watching the sun drop below the horizon. the bright moon is already on the rise, 
filling the arena with that strange twilight. we're about to settle down to our meal of raw fish 
when the anthem begins. and then the faces ... 

cashmere. gloss. wiress. mags. the woman from district 5. the morphling who gave her 

life for peeta. blight. the man from 10. 

eight dead. plus eight from the first night. two-thirds of us gone in a day and a half. that 

must be some kind of record. 

â€œthey're  really  burning  through  us,â€  says  johanna.  â€œwho's  left?  besides  us  five  and 

district two?â€ asks finnick. 

â€œchaff,â€ says peeta, without needing to think about it. perhaps  he's been keeping an eye 

out for him because of haymitch.

igging something, i guess the point of her knife, into my flesh, twisting it around. 
there's an excruciating ripping sensation and warmth runs down my wrist, filling my palm. 
she swipes down my arm and coats half my face with my blood. 

â€œstay down!â€ she hisses. her weight leaves my body and i'm alone. 

stay  down? i  think. what?  what  is  happening? my  eyes  shut,  blocking  out  the 

inconsistent world, as i try to make sense of my situation. 

all i can think of is johanna shoving wiress to the beach. â€œjust stay down, will you?â€ but 
she didn't attack wiress. not like this. i'm not wiress, anyway. i'm not nuts. â€œjust stay down, 
will you?â€ echoes around inside my brain. 

footsteps coming. two pairs. heavy, not trying to conceal their whereabouts. 

brutus's voice. â€œshe's good as dead! come on, enobaria!â€ feet moving into the night.
