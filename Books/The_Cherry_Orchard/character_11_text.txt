act one


[a room which is still called the nursery. one of the doors leads into
anyaâ€™s room. it is close on sunrise. it is may. the cherry-trees are
in flower but it is chilly in the garden. there is an early frost.
the windows of the room are sh

lopakhin with a book in his hand.]

lopakhin. the trainâ€™s arrived, thank god. whatâ€™s the time?

dunyasha. it will soon be two. [blows out candle] it is light already.

lopakhin. how much was the train late? two hours at least. [yawns and
stretches himself] i have made a rotten mess of it! i came here on
purpose to meet them at the station, and then overslept myself... in my
chair. itâ€™s a pity. i wish youâ€™d wakened me.

dunyasha. i thought youâ€™d gone away. [listening] i think i hear them
coming.

lopakhin. [listens] no.... theyâ€™ve got to collect their luggage and so
on.... [pause] lubov andreyevna has been living abroad for five years;
i donâ€™t know what sheâ€™ll be like now.... sheâ€™s a good sort--an easy,
simple person. i remember when i was a boy of fifteen, my father, who
is dead--he used to keep a shop in the village here--hit me on the face
with his fist, and my nose bled.... we had gone into the yard toget

â€œlittle manâ€.... my father was a peasant, itâ€™s true, but here i am in a
white waistcoat and yellow shoes... a pearl out of an oyster. iâ€™m rich
now, with lots of money, but just think about it and examine me, and
youâ€™ll find iâ€™m still a peasant down to the marrow of my bones. [turns
over the pages of his book] here iâ€™ve been reading this book, but i
understood nothing. i read and fell asleep. [pause.]

dunyasha. the dogs didnâ€™t sleep all night; they know that theyâ€™re
coming.

lopakhin. whatâ€™s up with you, dunyasha...?

dunyasha. my hands are shaking. i shall faint.

lopakhin. youâ€™re too sensitive, dunyasha. you dress just like a lady,
and you do your hair like one too. you oughtnâ€™t. you should know your
place.

epikhodov. [enters with a bouquet. he wears a short jacket and
brilliantly polished boots which squeak audibly. he drops the bouquet as
he enters, then picks it up] the gardener sent

these; says theyâ€™re to go
into the dining-room. [gives the bouquet to dunyasha.]

lopakhin. and youâ€™ll bring me some kvass.

dunyasha. very well. [exit.]

epikhodov. thereâ€™s a frost this morning--three degrees, and the
cherry-trees are all in flower. i canâ€™t approve of our climate. [sighs]
i canâ€™t. our climate is indisposed to favour us even this once. and,
ermolai alexeyevitch, allow me to say to you, in addition, that i bought
myself some boots two days ago, and i beg to assure you that they squeak
in a perfectly unbearable manner. what shall i put on them?

lopakhin. go away. you bore me.

epikhodov. some misfortune

happens to me every day. but i donâ€™t
complain; iâ€™m used to it, and i can smile. [dunyasha comes in and
brings lopakhin some kvass] i shall go. [knocks over a chair] there....
[triumphantly] there, you see, if i may use the word, what circumstances
i am in, so to speak. it is even simply marvellous. [exit.]

dunyasha. i may confess to you, ermolai alexeyevitch, that epikhodov has
proposed to me.

lopakhin. ah!

dunyasha. i donâ€™t know what to do about it. heâ€™s a nice young man, but
every now and again, when he begins talking, you canâ€™t understand a word
heâ€™s saying. i think i like him. heâ€™s madly in love with me. heâ€™s an
unlucky man; every day something happens. we tease him about it. they
call him â€œtwo-and-twenty troubles.â€

lopakhin. [listens] there they come, i think.

dunyasha. theyâ€™re coming! whatâ€™s the matter with me? iâ€™m cold all over.

lopakhin. there they are, right enough. letâ€™

know me? we havenâ€™t seen each other for five years.

dunyasha. [excited] i shall faint in a minute.... oh, iâ€™m fainting!

[two carriages are heard driving up to the house. lopakhin and dunyasha
quickly go out. the stage is empty. a noise begins in the next room.
fiers, leaning on a stick, walks quickly across the stage; he has just
been to meet lubov andreyevna. he wears an old-fashioned livery and a
tall hat. he is saying something to himself, but not a word of it can be
made out. the noise behind the stage gets louder and louder. a voice is
heard: â€œletâ€™s go in there.â€ enter lubov andreyevna, anya, and charlotta
ivanovna with a little dog on a chain, and all dressed in travelli

simeonov-pischin, lopakhin, dunyasha with a parcel and an umbrella, and
a servant with luggage--all cross the room.]

anya. letâ€™s come through here. do you remember what this room is,
mother?

lubov. [joyfully, through her tears] the nursery!

varya. how cold it is! my hands are quite numb. [to lubov andreyevna]
your rooms, the white one and the violet one, are just as they used to
be, mother.

lubov. my dear nursery, oh, you beautiful room.... i used to sleep
here when i was a baby. [weeps] and here i am like a little girl agai

she used to be, just like a nun. and i knew dunyasha. [kisses her.]

gaev. the train was two hours late. there now; howâ€™s that for
punctuality?

charlotta. [to pischin] my dog eats nuts too.

pischin. [astonished] to think of that, now!

[all go out except anya and dunyasha.]

dunyasha. we did have to wait for you!

[takes off anyaâ€™s cloak and hat.]

anya. i didnâ€™t get any sleep for four nights on the journey.... iâ€™m
awfully cold.

dunyasha. you went away during lent, when it was snowing and frosty, but
now? darling! [laughs and kisses her] we did have to wait for you, my
joy, my pet.... i must tell you at once, i canâ€™t bear to wait a minute.

anya. [tired] something else now...?

dunyasha. the clerk, epikhodov, proposed to me after easter.

anya. always the same....

[puts her hair straight] iâ€™ve lost all my
hairpins.... [she is very tired, and even staggers as she walks.]

dunyasha. i donâ€™t know what to think about it. he loves me, he loves me
so much!

anya. [looks into her room; in a gentle voice] my room, my windows, as
if iâ€™d never gone away. iâ€™m at home! to-morrow morning iâ€™ll get up and
have a run in the garden....oh, if i could only get to sleep! i didnâ€™t
sleep the whole journey, i was so bothered.

dunyasha. peter sergeyevitch came two days ago.

anya. [joyfully] peter!

dunyasha. he sleeps in the bath-house, he lives there. he said he was
afraid heâ€™d be in the way. [looks at her pocket-watch] i ought to wake
him, but barbara mihailovna told me not to. â€œdonâ€™t wake him,â€ she said.

[enter varya, a bunch of keys on her belt.]

varya. dunyasha, some coffee, quick. mother wants some.

dunyasha. this minute. [exit.]

varya. well, youâ€™ve come, glory be to god. home again. [caressing her]

not his affair... he pays no attention to me. bless the man, i donâ€™t
want to see him.... but everybody talks about our marriage, everybody
congratulates me, and thereâ€™s nothing in it at all, itâ€™s all like a
dream. [in another tone] youâ€™ve got a brooch like a bee.

anya. [sadly] mother bought it. [goes into her room, and talks lightly,
like a child] in paris i went up in a balloon!

varya. my darlingâ€™s come back, my pretty oneâ€™s come back! [dunyasha has
already returned with the coffee-pot and is making the coffee, varya
stands near the door] i go about all day, looking after the house, and
i think all the time, if only you could marry a rich man, then iâ€™d be
happy and would go away somewhere by myself, then to kiev... to moscow,
and so on, from one holy place to another. iâ€™d tramp and tramp. that
would be splendid!

yasha. [crossing the stage: politely] may i go this way?

dunyasha. i hardly knew you, yasha. you have changed abroad.

yasha. hm... and who are you?

dunyasha. when you went away i was only so high. [showing with her hand]
iâ€™m dunyasha, the daughter of theodore kozoyedov. you donâ€™t remember!

yasha. oh, you little cucumber!

[looks round and embraces her. she screams and drops a saucer. yasha
goes out quickly.]

varya. [in the doorway: in an angry voice] whatâ€™s that?

dunyasha. [through her tears] iâ€™ve broken a saucer.

varya. it may bring luck.

anya. [coming out of her room] we must tell mother that peterâ€™s here.

varya. i told them not to wake him.

seven! mother couldnâ€™t bear it; she went away, away, without looking
round.... [shudders] how i understand her; if only she knew! [pause] and
peter trofimov was grishaâ€™s tutor, he might tell her....

[enter fiers in a short jacket and white waistcoat.]

fiers. [goes to the coffee-pot, nervously] the mistress is going to
have some food here.... [puts on white gloves] is the coffee ready? [to
dunyasha, severely] you! whereâ€™s the cream?

dunyasha. oh, dear me...! [rapid exit.]

fiers. [fussing round the coffee-pot] oh, you bungler.... [murmurs
to himself] back from paris... the master went to paris once... in a
carriage.... [laughs.]

varya. what are you talking about, fiers?

fiers. i beg your pardon? [joyfully] the mistress is home again. iâ€™ve

act two


[in a field. an old, crooked shrine, which has been long abandoned; near
it a well and large stones, which apparently are old tombstones, and
an old garden seat. the road is seen to gaevâ€™s estate. on one side rise
dark poplars, behind them begins the cherry orchard. in the distance
is a row of telegraph poles, and far, far away on the horizon are the
indistinct signs of a large town, which can only be seen on the finest
and clearest days. it is close on sunset. charlotta, yasha, and dunyasha
are sitting on the seat; epikhodov stands by and plays on a guitar; all
seem thoughtful. charlotta wears a manâ€™s old peaked cap; she has unslung
a rifle from her shoulders and is putting to rights the buckle on the
strap.]

charlotta. [thoughtfully] i havenâ€™t a real passport. i donâ€™t know how
old i am, and i think iâ€™m young. when i was a little girl my father and
mother used to go round fairs and give very good performances and i used
to do the _salto mortale_ and various little things.

h me. i liked
it. i grew up and became a governess. and where i came from and who
i am, i donâ€™t know.... who my parents were--perhaps they werenâ€™t
married--i donâ€™t know. [takes a cucumber out of her pocket and eats] i
donâ€™t know anything. [pause] i do want to talk, but i havenâ€™t anybody to
talk to... i havenâ€™t anybody at all.

epikhodov. [plays on the guitar and sings]

   â€œwhat is this noisy earth to me,
   what matter friends and foes?â€
    i do like playing on the mandoline!

dunyasha. thatâ€™s a guitar, not a mandoline. [looks at herself in a
little mirror and powders herself.]

epikhodov. for the enamoured madman, this is a mandoline. [sings]

   â€œoh that the heart was warmed,
   by all the flames of love returned!â€

[yasha sings too.]

charlotta. these people sing terribly.... foo! like jackals.

dunyasha. [to yasha] still, it must be nice to live abroad.

yasha. yes, certainly. i cannot differ from you there. [yawns and lights
a cigar.]

in her dealings with me as a storm is to a small ship. suppose, let
us grant, i am wrong; then why did i wake up this morning, to give an
example, and behold an enormous spider on my chest, like that. [shows
with both hands] and if i do drink some kvass, why is it that there is
bound to be something of the most indelicate nature in it, such as a
beetle? [pause] have you read buckle? [pause] i should like to trouble
you, avdotya fedorovna, for two words.

dunyasha. say on.

epikhodov. i should prefer to be alone with you. [sighs.]

dunyasha. [shy] very well, only first bring me my little cloak.... itâ€™s
by the cupboard. itâ€™s a little damp here.

epikhodov. very well... iâ€™ll bring it.... now i know what to do with my
revolver. [takes guitar and exits, strumming.]

yasha. two-and-twenty troubles! a silly man, between you and me and the
gatepost. [yawns.]

nervous, iâ€™m worried. i

of everything.... iâ€™m so frightened. and i donâ€™t know what will happen
to my nerves if you deceive me, yasha.

yasha. [kisses her] little cucumber! of course, every girl must respect
herself; thereâ€™s nothing i dislike more than a badly behaved girl.

dunyasha. iâ€™m awfully in love with you; youâ€™re educated, you can talk
about everything. [pause.]

yasha. [yawns] yes. i think this: if a girl loves anybody, then that
means sheâ€™s immoral. [pause] itâ€™s nice to smoke a cigar out in the open
air.... [listens] somebodyâ€™s coming. itâ€™s the mistress, and people with
her. [dunyasha embraces him suddenly] go to the house, as if youâ€™d been
bathing in the river; go by this path, or theyâ€™ll meet you and will
think iâ€™ve been meeting you. i canâ€™t

gaev, and lopakhin.]

lopakhin. you must make up your mind definitely--thereâ€™s no time to
waste. the question is perfectly plain. are you willing to let the land
for villas or no? just one word, yes or no? just one word!

doing in town? [to dunyasha] dunyasha, give the musicians some tea.

trousers is waving its hands and jumping about; there are cries of
â€œbravo, charlotta ivanovna!â€]

dunyasha. [stops to powder her face] the young mistress tells me to
dance--there are a lot of gentlemen, but few ladies--and my head
goes round when i dance, and my heart beats, fiers nicolaevitch; the
post-office clerk told me something just now which made me catch my
breath. [the music grows faint.]

some insect. [sighs] oh, life!

dunyasha. what do you want?

epikhodov. undoubtedly, perhaps, you may be right. [sighs] but,
certainly, if you regard the matter from the aspect, then you, if i may
say so, and you must excuse my candidness, have absolutely reduced me to
a state of mind. i know my fate, every day something unfortunate happens
to me, and iâ€™ve grown used to it a long time ago, i even look at my fate
with a smile. you gave me your word, and though i...

varya. havenâ€™t you gone yet, simeon? you really have no respect for
anybody. [to dunyasha] you go away, dunyasha. [to epikhodov] you play
billiards and break a cue, and walk about the drawing-room as if you
were a visitor!

epikhodov. you cannot, if i may say so, call me to order.

varya. iâ€™m not calling you to order, iâ€™m only telling you. you just walk
about from place to place and never do your work. goodness only knows
why we keep a clerk.

billiards, is only a matter to be settled by people of understanding and
my elders.
