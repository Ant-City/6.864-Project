himself would bawl out a lawyer that didn't, even if they both knew
the guy was guilty! but even so, i don't pad out the truth like cecil
rountree or thayer or the rest of these realtors. fact, i think a fellow
that's willing to deliberately up and profit by lying ought to be shot!"

babbitt's value to his clients was rarely better shown than this
morning, in the conference at eleven-thirty between himself, conrad
lyte, and archibald purdy.

conrad lyte was a real-estate speculator. he was a nervous speculator.
before he gambled he consulted bankers, lawyers, architects, contracting
builders, and all of their clerks and stenographers who were willing
to be cornered and give him advice. he was a bold entrepreneur, and he
desired nothing more than complete safety in his investments, freedom
from attention to details, and the thirty or forty per cent. profit
which, according to all authorities, a pioneer deserves for his risks
and foresight. he w

when the chop came he vigorously peppered it and salted it. he always
peppered and salted his meat, and vigorously, before tasting it.

paul and he took up the spring-like quality of the spring, the virtues
of the electric cigar-lighter, and the action of the new york state
assembly. it was not till babbitt was thick and disconsolate with mutton
grease that he flung out:

"i wound up a nice little deal with conrad lyte this morning that put
five hundred good round plunks in my pocket. pretty nice--pretty nice!
and yet--i don't know what's the matter with me to-day. maybe it's an
attack of spring fever, or staying up too late at verg gunch's, or maybe
it's just the winter's work piling up, but i've felt kind of down in the
mouth all day long. course i wouldn't beef about it to the fellows at
the roughnecks' table there, but you--ever feel that way, paul? kind

mcgoun out there?"

so chill a wind of hatred blew from the outer office that the normal
comfort of his evening home-going was ruined. he was distressed by
losing that approval of his employees to which an executive is always
slave. ordinarily he left the office with a thousand enjoyable fussy
directions to the effect that there would undoubtedly be important tasks
to-morrow, and miss mcgoun and miss bannigan would do well to be there
early, and for heaven's sake remind him to call up conrad lyte soon 's
he came in. to-night he departed with feigned and apologetic liveliness.
he was as afraid of his still-faced clerks--of the eyes focused on him,
miss mcgoun staring with head lifted from her typing, miss bannigan
looking over her ledger, mat penniman craning around at his desk in the
dark alcove, stanley graff sullenly expressionless--as a parvenu before
the bleak propriety of his butler. he hated to expose his back to their
laughter, and in his effort to be casually merry he stammered

thursday, the to-morrow of tanis's note, was full of emotional crises.
at the roughnecks' table at the club, verg gunch talked of the good
citizens' league and (it seemed to babbitt) deliberately left him out
of the invitations to join. old mat penniman, the general utility man
at babbitt's office, had troubles, and came in to groan about them: his
oldest boy was "no good," his wife was sick, and he had quarreled with
his brother-in-law. conrad lyte also had troubles, and since lyte was
one of his best clients, babbitt had to listen to them. mr. lyte, it
appeared, was suffering from a peculiarly interesting neuralgia, and
the garage had overcharged him. when babbitt came home, everybody had
troubles: his wife was simultaneously thinking about discharging the
impudent new maid, and worried lest the maid leave; and tinka desired to
denounce her teacher.

"oh, quit fussing!" babbitt fussed. "you never hear me whining about my
troubles, and ye

as these plots to keep folks from being liberal. this is a free
country. a man can do anything he wants to."

"course th' ain't any plots. who said they was? only if folks get an
idea you're scatter-brained and unstable, you don't suppose they'll want
to do business with you, do you? one little rumor about your being a
crank would do more to ruin this business than all the plots and stuff
that these fool story-writers could think up in a month of sundays."

that afternoon, when the old reliable conrad lyte, the merry miser,
conrad lyte, appeared, and babbitt suggested his buying a parcel of land
in the new residential section of dorchester, lyte said hastily, too
hastily, "no, no, don't want to go into anything new just now."

a week later babbitt learned, through henry thompson, that the officials
of the street traction company were planning another real-estate coup,
and that sanders, torrey and wing, not the babbitt-thompson company,
were to handle it for them. "i figure that jake offutt is kin
