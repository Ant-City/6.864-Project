t were the duty of every person not to be mistaken through thickness of voice. “yes, i knew of such a man,” he said.
“and what ghastly gallicrow might the poor fellow have been like, master fairway?” asked the turf-cutter.
“well, ‘a was neither a deaf man, nor a dumb man, nor a blind man. what ‘a was i don’t say.”
“is he known in these parts?” said olly dowden.
“hardly,” said timothy; “but i name no name.... come, keep the fire up there, youngsters.”
“whatever is christian cantle’s teeth a-chattering for?” said a boy from amid the smoke and shades on the other side of the blaze. “be ye a-cold, christian?”
a thin jibbering voice was heard to reply, “no, not at all.”
“come forward, christian, and show yourself. i didn’t know you were here,” said fairway, with a humane look across towards that quarter.
thus requested, a faltering man, with reedy hair, no shoulders, and a great quantity of wrist and ankle beyond his clothes, advanced a step or two by his o

ughter,” said fairway. “not that a body of her age can want a fire much.”
“she is very strange in her ways, living up there by herself, and such things please her,” said susan.
“she’s a well-favoured maid enough,” said humphrey the furze-cutter, “especially when she’s got one of her dandy gowns on.”
“that’s true,” said fairway. “well, let her bonfire burn an’t will. ours is well-nigh out by the look o’t.”
“how dark ‘tis now the fire’s gone down!” said christian cantle, looking behind him with his hare eyes. “don’t ye think we’d better get home-along, neighbours? the heth isn’t haunted, i know; but we’d better get home.... ah, what was that?”
“only the wind,” said the turf-cutter.
“i don’t think fifth-of-novembers ought to be kept up by night except in towns. it should be by day in outstep, ill-accounted places like this!”
“nonsense, christian. lift up your spirits like a man! susy, dear, you and i will have a jig—hey, my honey?—be

, you are getting weary of doing well.”
“no,” said her son, “i am not weary of that, though i am weary of what you mean by it. mother, what is doing well?”
mrs. yeobright was far too thoughtful a woman to be content with ready definitions, and, like the “what is wisdom?” of plato’s socrates, and the “what is truth?” of pontius pilate, yeobright’s burning question received no answer.
the silence was broken by the clash of the garden gate, a tap at the door, and its opening. christian cantle appeared in the room in his sunday clothes.
it was the custom on egdon to begin the preface to a story before absolutely entering the house, so as to be well in for the body of the narrative by the time visitor and visited stood face to face. christian had been saying to them while the door was leaving its latch, “to think that i, who go from home but once in a while, and hardly then, should have been there this morning!”
“‘tis news you have brought us, then, christian?” said mrs. yeo

sun threw the shadow of the house over the palings, across the grass margin of the heath, and far up the vale, where the chimney outlines and those of the surrounding tree-tops stretched forth in long dark prongs. having been seated at work all day, he decided to take a turn upon the hills before it got dark; and, going out forthwith, he struck across the heath towards mistover.
it was an hour and a half later when he again appeared at the garden gate. the shutters of the house were closed, and christian cantle, who had been wheeling manure about the garden all day, had gone home. on entering he found that his mother, after waiting a long time for him, had finished her meal.
“where have you been, clym?” she immediately said. “why didn’t you tell me that you were going away at this time?”
“i have been on the heath.”
“you’ll meet eustacia vye if you go up there.”
clym paused a minute. “yes, i met her this evening,” he said, as though it were spoken under the sheer necessity of pr

 of the money than the present. and the chance that would be afforded her, by sending him this gift, of showing how far she was from bearing him ill-will, cheered the sad mother’s heart.
she went upstairs and took from a locked drawer a little box, out of which she poured a hoard of broad unworn guineas that had lain there many a year. there were a hundred in all, and she divided them into two heaps, fifty in each. tying up these in small canvas bags, she went down to the garden and called to christian cantle, who was loitering about in hope of a supper which was not really owed him. mrs. yeobright gave him the moneybags, charged him to go to mistover, and on no account to deliver them into any one’s hands save her son’s and thomasin’s. on further thought she deemed it advisable to tell christian precisely what the two bags contained, that he might be fully impressed with their importance. christian pocketed the moneybags, promised the greatest carefulness, and set out on his way.

the live adder regarded the assembled group with a sinister look in its small black eye, and the beautiful brown and jet pattern on its back seemed to intensify with indignation. mrs. yeobright saw the creature, and the creature saw her—she quivered throughout, and averted her eyes.
“look at that,” murmured christian cantle. “neighbours, how do we know but that something of the old serpent in god’s garden, that gied the apple to the young woman with no clothes, lives on in adders and snakes still? look at his eye—for all the world like a villainous sort of black currant. ‘tis to be hoped he can’t ill-wish us! there’s folks in heath who’ve been overlooked already. i will never kill another adder as long as i live.”

“charley, what are they doing?” said clym. “my sight is weaker again tonight, and the glass of this window is not good.”
charley wiped his own eyes, which were rather blurred with moisture, and stepped closer to the casement. “mr. venn is asking christian cantle to sing,” he replied, “and christian is moving about in his chair as if he were much frightened at the question, and his father has struck up a stave instead of him.”
“yes, i can hear the old man’s voice,” said clym. “so there’s to be no dancing, i suppose. and is thomasin in the room? i see something moving in front of the candles that resembles her shape, i think.”
“yes. she do seem happy. she is red in the face, and laughing at something fairway has said to her. o my!”
