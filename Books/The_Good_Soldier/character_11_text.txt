holy sepulchre. and they struck on a rock somewhere, and,
at great expense, the husband had to fit out an expedition to fetch him
back. and peire vidal fell all over the lady's bed while the husband,
who was a most ferocious warrior, remonstrated some more about the
courtesy that is due to great poets. but i suppose la louve was the more
ferocious of the two. anyhow, that is all that came of it. isn't that a
story?

you haven't an idea of the queer old-fashionedness of florence's
aunts--the misses hurlbird, nor yet of her uncle. an extraordinarily
lovable man, that uncle john. thin, gentle, and with a "heart" that made
his life very much what florence's afterwards became. he didn't reside
at stamford; his home was in waterbury where the watches come from. he
had a factory there which, in our queer american way, would change
its functions almost from year to year. for nine months or so it would
manufacture buttons out of bone. then it would suddenly produce brass
buttons for coachmen's liveries. t

hat i
have never told you anything about my marriage. that was like this:
i have told you, as i think, that i first met florence at the
stuyvesants', in fourteenth street. and, from that moment, i determined
with all the obstinacy of a possibly weak nature, if not to make her
mine, at least to marry her. i had no occupation--i had no business
affairs. i simply camped down there in stamford, in a vile hotel, and
just passed my days in the house, or on the verandah of the misses
hurlbird. the misses hurlbird, in an odd, obstinate way, did not like
my presence. but they were hampered by the national manners of these
occasions. florence had her own sitting-room. she could ask to it whom
she liked, and i simply walked into that apartment. i was as timid as
you will, but in that matter i was like a chicken that is determined
to get across the road in front of an automobile. i would walk into
florence's pretty, little, old-fashioned room, take off my hat, and sit
down.

florence had, of course, several

other fellows, too--strapping young
new englanders, who worked during the day in new york and spent only the
evenings in the village of their birth. and, in the evenings, they
would march in on florence with almost as much determination as i myself
showed. and i am bound to say that they were received with as much
disfavour as was my portion--from the misses hurlbird....

they were curious old creatures, those two. it was almost as if they
were members of an ancient family under some curse--they were so
gentlewomanly, so proper, and they sighed so. sometimes i would see
tears in their eyes. i do not know that my courtship of florence made
much progress at first. perhaps that was because it took place almost
entirely during the daytime, on hot afternoons, when the clouds of dust
hung like fog, right up as high as the tops of the thin-leaved elms. the
night,

 as different temperaments. i assure you they were almost
affectionate, concerned for me even, as if florence were too bright for
my solid and serious virtues.

for they had discovered in me solid and serious virtues. that might
have been because i had once dropped the remark that i preferred general
braddock to general washington. for the hurlbirds had backed the losing
side in the war of independence, and had been seriously impoverished and
quite efficiently oppressed for that reason. the misses hurlbird could
never forget it.

nevertheless they shuddered at the thought of a european career for
myself and florence. each of them really wailed when they heard that
that was what i hoped to give their niece. that may have been partly
because they regarded europe as a sink of iniquity, where strange
laxities prevailed. they thought the mother country as erastian as any
other. and they carried their protests to extraordinary lengths, for
them....

they even, almost, said that marriage was a sacrament

well, that about brings me up to the date of my receiving, in waterbury,
the laconic cable from edward to the effect that he wanted me to go to
branshaw and have a chat. i was pretty busy at the time and i was half
minded to send him a reply cable to the effect that i would start in
a fortnight. but i was having a long interview with old mr hurlbird's
attorneys and immediately afterwards i had to have a long interview with
the misses hurlbird, so i delayed cabling.

i had expected to find the misses hurlbird excessively old--in the
nineties or thereabouts. the time had passed so slowly that i had the
impression that it must have been thirty years since i had been in the
united states. it was only twelve years. actually miss hurlbird was just
sixty-one and miss florence hurlbird fifty-nine, and they were both,
mentally and physically, as vigorous as could be desired. they were,
indeed, more vigorous, mentally, than suited my purpose,

at there were real tears shed by both
miss hurlbird and miss florence before i left that city. i left it quite
abruptly. four hours after edward's telegram came another from leonora,
saying: "yes, do come. you could be so helpful." i simply told my
attorney that there was the million and a half; that he could invest
it as he liked, and that the purposes must be decided by the misses
hurlbird. i was, anyhow, pretty well worn out by all the discussions.
and, as i have never heard yet from the misses hurlbird, i rather
think that miss hurlbird, either by revelations or by moral force, has
persuaded miss florence that no memorial to their names shall be erected
in the city of waterbury, conn. miss hurlbird wept dreadfully when she
heard that i was going to stay with the ashburnhams, but she did not
make any comments. i was aware, at that date, that her niece had been
seduced by that fellow jimmy before i had married her--but i contrived
to produce on her the impression that i thought florence had bee
