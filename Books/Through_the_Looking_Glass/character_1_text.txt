eens;â€™ and
her sister, who liked being very exact, had argued that they couldnâ€™t,
because there were only two of them, and alice had been reduced at last
to say, â€˜well, you can be one of them then, and iâ€™ll be all the rest.â€™
and once she had really frightened her old nurse by shouting suddenly in
her ear, â€˜nurse! do letâ€™s pretend that iâ€™m a hungry hyaena, and youâ€™re a
bone.â€™

but this is taking us away from aliceâ€™s speech to the kitten. â€˜letâ€™s
pretend that youâ€™re the red queen, kitty! do you know, i think if you
sat up and folded your arms, youâ€™d look exactly like her. now do try,
thereâ€™s a dear!â€™ and alice got the red queen off the table, and set it
up before the kitten as a model for it to imitate: however, the thing
didnâ€™t succeed, principally, alice said, because the kitten wouldnâ€™t
fold its arms properly. so, to punish it, she held it up to the
looking-glass, that it might see how sulky it was--â€˜and if youâ€™re not
good directly,â€™ she added, â€˜iâ€

the chimney-piece (you know you can only see the back of it in the
looking-glass) had got the face of a little old man, and grinned at her.

â€˜they donâ€™t keep this room so tidy as the other,â€™ alice thought to
herself, as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth among
the cinders: but in another moment, with a little â€˜oh!â€™ of surprise, she
was down on her hands and knees watching them. the chessmen were walking
about, two and two!

â€˜here are the red king and the red queen,â€™ alice said (in a whisper, for
fear of frightening them), â€˜and there are the white king and the white
queen sitting on the edge of the shovel--and here are two castles
walking arm in arm--i donâ€™t think they can hear me,â€™ she went on, as she
put her head closer down, â€˜and iâ€™m nearly sure they canâ€™t see me. i feel
somehow as if i were invisible--â€™

here something began squeaking on the table behind alice, and made her
turn her head just in time to see one of the white pawns roll

ver come out here?â€™

â€˜i daresay youâ€™ll see her soon,â€™ said the rose. â€˜sheâ€™s one of the thorny
kind.â€™

â€˜where does she wear the thorns?â€™ alice asked with some curiosity.

â€˜why all round her head, of course,â€™ the rose replied. â€˜i was wondering
you hadnâ€™t got some too. i thought it was the regular rule.â€™

â€˜sheâ€™s coming!â€™ cried the larkspur. â€˜i hear her footstep, thump, thump,
thump, along the gravel-walk!â€™

alice looked round eagerly, and found that it was the red queen. â€˜sheâ€™s
grown a good deal!â€™ was her first remark. she had indeed: when alice
first found her in the ashes, she had been only three inches high--and
here she was, half a head taller than alice herself!

â€˜itâ€™s the fresh air that does it,â€™ said the rose: â€˜wonderfully fine air
it is, out here.â€™

â€˜i think iâ€™ll go and meet her,â€™ said alice, for, though the flowers were
interesting enough, she felt that it would be far grander to have a talk
with a real queen.

â€˜you canâ€™t pos

sibly do that,â€™ said the rose: â€˜_i_ should advise you to
walk the other way.â€™

this sounded nonsense to alice, so she said nothing, but set off at
once towards the red queen. to her surprise, she lost sight of her in a
moment, and found herself walking in at the front-door again.

a little provoked, she drew back, and after looking everywhere for the
queen (whom she spied out at last, a long way off), she thought she
would try the plan, this time, of walking in the opposite direction.

it succeeded beautifully. she had not been walking a minute before she
found herself face to face with the red queen, and full in sight of the
hill she had been so long aiming at.

€˜where do you come from?â€™ said the red queen. â€˜and where are you going?
look up, speak nicely, and donâ€™t twiddle your fingers all the time.â€™

alice attended to all these directions, and explained, as well as she
could, that she had lost her way.

â€˜i donâ€™t know what you mean by your way,â€™ said the queen: â€˜all the ways
about here belong to me--but why did you come out here at all?â€™ she
added in a kinder tone. â€˜curtsey while youâ€™re thinking what to say, it
saves time.â€™

alice wondered a little at this, but she was too m

compared with which this would be a wilderness.â€™

alice didnâ€™t dare to argue the point, but went on: â€˜--and i thought iâ€™d
try and find my way to the top of that hill--â€™

â€˜when you say â€œhill,â€â€™ the queen interrupted, â€˜_i_ could show you hills,
in comparison with which youâ€™d call that a valley.â€™

â€˜no, i shouldnâ€™t,â€™ said alice, surprised into contradicting her at last:
â€˜a hill canâ€™t be a valley, you know. that would be nonsense--â€™

the red queen shook her head, â€˜you may call it â€œnonsenseâ€ if you like,â€™
she said, â€˜but iâ€™ve heard nonsense, compared with which that would be as
sensible as a dictionary!â€™

alice curtseyed again, as she was afraid from the queenâ€™s tone that she
was a little offended: and they walked on in silence till they got to
the top of the little hill.

for some minutes alice stood without speaking, looking out in all
directions over the country--and a most curious country it was. there
were a number of

to be dignified, you know!â€™

so she got up and walked about--rather stiffly just at first, as she was
afraid that the crown might come off: but she comforted herself with the
thought that there was nobody to see her, â€˜and if i really am a queen,â€™
she said as she sat down again, â€˜i shall be able to manage it quite well
in time.â€™

everything was happening so oddly that she didnâ€™t feel a bit surprised
at finding the red queen and the white queen sitting close to her, one
on each side: she would have liked very much to ask them how they came
there, but she feared it would not be quite civil. however, there would
be no harm, she thought, in asking if the game was over. â€˜please, would
you tell me--â€™ she began, looking timidly at the red queen.

â€˜speak when youâ€™re spoken to!â€™ the queen sharply interrupted her.

â€˜but if everybody obeyed that rule,â€™ said alice, who was always ready
for a little argument, â€˜

ied the queen. â€˜why, donâ€™t you see, child--â€™ here she
broke off with a frown, and, after thinking for a minute, suddenly
changed the subject of the conversation. â€˜what do you mean by â€œif you
really are a queenâ€? what right have you to call yourself so? you canâ€™t
be a queen, you know, till youâ€™ve passed the proper examination. and the
sooner we begin it, the better.â€™

â€˜i only said â€œifâ€!â€™ poor alice pleaded in a piteous tone.

the two queens looked at each other, and the red queen remarked, with a
little shudder, â€˜she says she only said â€œifâ€--â€™

â€˜but she said a great deal more than that!â€™ the white queen moaned,
wringing her hands. â€˜oh, ever so much more than that!â€™

â€˜so you did, you know,â€™ the red queen said to alice. â€˜always speak the
truth--think before you speak--and write it down afterwards.â€™

â€˜iâ€™m sure i didnâ€™t mean--â€™ alice was beginning, but the red queen
interrupted her impatiently.

â€˜thatâ€™s just what i complain of! you should

suppose is the use of child without any meaning? even a joke should
have some meaning--and a childâ€™s more important than a joke, i hope. you
couldnâ€™t deny that, even if you tried with both hands.â€™

â€˜i donâ€™t deny things with my hands,â€™ alice objected.

â€˜nobody said you did,â€™ said the red queen. â€˜i said you couldnâ€™t if you
tried.â€™

â€˜sheâ€™s in that state of mind,â€™ said the white queen, â€˜that she wants to
deny something--only she doesnâ€™t know what to deny!â€™

â€˜a nasty, vicious temper,â€™ the red queen remarked; and then there was an
uncomfortable silence for a minute or two.

the red queen broke the silence by saying to the white queen, â€˜i invite
you to aliceâ€™s dinner-party this afternoon.â€™

the white queen smiled feebly, and said â€˜and i invite you.â€™

â€˜i di

dnâ€™t know i was to have a party at all,â€™ said alice; â€˜but if there
is to be one, i think _i_ ought to invite the guests.â€™

â€˜we gave you the opportunity of doing it,â€™ the red queen remarked: â€˜but
i daresay youâ€™ve not had many lessons in manners yet?â€™

â€˜manners are not taught in lessons,â€™ said alice. â€˜lessons teach you to
do sums, and things of that sort.â€™

â€˜and you do addition?â€™ the white queen asked. â€˜whatâ€™s one and one and
one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one?â€™

â€˜i donâ€™t know,â€™ said alice. â€˜i lost count.â€™

â€˜she canâ€™t do addition,â€™ the red queen interrupted. â€˜can you do
subtraction? take nine from eight.â€™
 
 ___________________________
 


â€˜nine from eight i canâ€™t, you know,â€™ alice replied very readily: â€˜but--â€™

â€˜she canâ€™t do subtraction,â€™ said the white queen. â€˜can you do division?
divide a loaf by a knife--whatâ€™s the answer to that?â€™

â€˜i suppose--â€™ alice was beginning, but the red queen answered for her.
â€˜bread-and-butter, of course. try another subtraction sum. take a bone
from a dog: what remains?â€™

alice considered. â€˜the bone wouldnâ€™t remain, of course, if i took
it--and the dog wouldnâ€™t remain; it would come to bite me--and iâ€™m sure
i shouldnâ€™t remain!â€™

â€˜then you think nothing would remain?â€™ said the red queen.

â€˜i think thatâ€™s the answer.â€™

â€˜wrong, as usual,â€™ said the red queen: â€˜the dogâ€™s temper would remain.â€™

â€˜but i donâ€™t see ho

â€˜why, look here!â€™ the red queen cried. â€˜the dog would lose its temper,
wouldnâ€™t it?â€™

â€˜perhaps it would,â€™ alice replied cautiously.

â€˜then if the dog went away, its temper would remain!â€™ the queen
exclaimed triumphantly.

alice said, as gravely as she could, â€˜they might go different ways.â€™ but
she couldnâ€™t help thinking to herself, â€˜what dreadful nonsense we are
talking!â€™

â€˜she canâ€™t do sums a bit!â€™ the queens said together, with great
emphasis.

â€˜can you do sums?â€™ alice said, turning suddenl

she didnâ€™t like being found fault with so much.

the queen gasped and shut her eyes. â€˜i can do addition, if you give me
time--but i canâ€™t do subtraction, under any circumstances!â€™

â€˜of course you know your a b c?â€™ said the red queen.

â€˜to be sure i do.â€™ said alice.

â€˜so do i,â€™ the white queen whispered: â€˜weâ€™ll often say it over together,
dear. and iâ€™ll tell you a secret--i can read words of one letter! isnâ€™t
that grand! however, donâ€™t be discouraged. youâ€™ll come to it in time.â€™

here the red queen began again. â€˜can you answer useful questions?â€™ she
said. â€˜how is bread made?â€™

â€˜i know that!â€™ alice cried eagerly. â€˜you take some flour--â€™

â€˜where do you pick the flower?â€™ the white quee

n asked. â€˜in a garden, or
in the hedges?â€™

â€˜well, it isnâ€™t picked at all,â€™ alice explained: â€˜itâ€™s ground--â€™

â€˜how many acres of ground?â€™ said the white queen. â€˜you mustnâ€™t leave out
so many things.â€™

â€˜fan her head!â€™ the red queen anxiously interrupted. â€˜sheâ€™ll be feverish
after so much thinking.â€™ so they set to work and fanned her with bunches
of leaves, till she had to beg them to leave off, it blew her hair about
so.

â€˜sheâ€™s all right again now,â€™ said the red queen. â€˜do you know languages?
whatâ€™s the french for fiddle-de-dee?â€™

â€˜fiddle-de-deeâ€™s not english,â€™ alice replied gravely.

â€˜who ever said it was?â€™ said the red queen.

alice thought she saw a way out of the difficulty this time. â€˜i

f youâ€™ll

but the red queen drew herself up rather stiffly, and said â€˜queens never
make bargains.â€™

â€˜i wish queens never asked questions,â€™ alice thought to herself.

â€˜donâ€™t let us quarrel,â€™ the white queen said in an anxious tone. â€˜what
is the cause of lightning?â€™

â€˜the cause of lightning,â€™ alice said very decidedly, for she felt quite
certain about this, â€˜is the thunder--no, no!â€™ she hastily corrected
herself. â€˜i meant the other way.â€™

â€˜itâ€™s too late to correct it,â€™ said the red queen:

 â€˜when youâ€™ve once
said a thing, that fixes it, and you must take the consequences.â€™

â€˜which reminds me--â€™ the white queen said, looking down and nervously
clasping and unclasping her hands, â€˜we had such a thunderstorm last
tuesday--i mean one of the last set of tuesdays, you know.â€™

alice was puzzled. â€˜in our country,â€™ she remarked, â€˜thereâ€™s only one day
at a time.â€™

the red queen said, â€˜thatâ€™s a poor thin way of doing things. now here,
we mostly have days and nights two or three at a time, and sometimes
in the winter we take as many as five nights together--for warmth, you
know.â€™

â€˜are five nights warmer than one night, then?â€™ alice ventured to ask.

â€˜five times as warm, of course.â€™

â€˜but they should be five times as cold, by the same rule--â€™

â€˜just so!â€™ cried the red queen. â€˜five times as warm, and five times
as cold--just as iâ€™m five times as
 
 ___________________________
 
 rich as you are, and five times as
clever!â€™

alice sighed and gave it up. â€˜itâ€™s exactly like a riddle with no
answer!â€™ she thought.

â€˜humpty dumpty saw it too,â€™ the white queen went on in a low voice, more
as if she were talking to herself. â€˜he came to the door with a corkscrew
in his hand--â€™

â€˜what did he want?â€™ said the red queen.

â€˜he said he would come in,â€™ the white queen went on, â€˜because he was
looking for a hippopotamus. now, as it happened, there wasnâ€™t such a
thing in the house, that morning.â€™

â€˜is there generally?â€™ alice asked in an astonished tone.

â€˜well, only on thursdays,â€™ said the queen.

â€˜i know what he came for,â€™ said alice: â€˜he wanted to punish the fish,
because--â€™

here the white queen began again. â€˜it was such a thunderstorm, you canâ€™t
think!â€™ (â€˜she never could, you k

the roof came off, and ever so much thunder got in--and it went
rolling round the room in great lumps--and knocking over the tables and
things--till i was so frightened, i couldnâ€™t remember my own name!â€™

alice thought to herself, â€˜i never should try to remember my name in the
middle of an accident! where would be the use of it?â€™ but she did not
say this aloud, for fear of hurting the poor queenâ€™s feeling.

â€˜your majesty must excuse her,â€™ the red queen said to ali
 
 ___________________________
 
ce, taking
one of the white queenâ€™s hands in her own, and gently stroking it:
â€˜she means well, but she canâ€™t help saying foolish things, as a general
rule.â€™

the white queen looked timidly at alice, who felt she ought to say
something kind, but really couldnâ€™t think of anything at the moment.

â€˜she never was really well brought up,â€™ the red queen went on: â€˜but
itâ€™s amazing how good-tempered she is! pat her on the head, and see how
pleased sheâ€™ll be!â€™ but this was more than alice had courage to do.

â€˜a little kindness--and putting her hair in papers--would do wonders
with her--â€™

the white queen gave a deep sigh, and laid her head on aliceâ€™s shoulder.
â€˜i am so sleepy?â€™ she moaned.

â€˜sheâ€™s tired, poor thing!â€™ said the red queen. â€˜smooth her hair--lend
her your nightcap--and sing her a soothing lullaby.â€™

â€˜i h

avenâ€™t got a nightcap with me,â€™ said alice, as she tried to obey the
first direction: â€˜and i donâ€™t know any soothing lullabies.â€™

â€˜i must do it myself, then,â€™ said the red queen, and she began:


   â€˜hush-a-by lady, in aliceâ€™s lap!
   till the feastâ€™s ready, weâ€™ve time for a nap:
   when the feastâ€™s over, weâ€™ll go to the ball--
   red queen, and white queen, and alice, and all!


â€˜and now you know the words,â€™ she added, as she put her head down on
aliceâ€™s other shoulder, â€˜just sing it through to me. iâ€™m getting sleepy,
too.â€™ in another moment both queens were fast asleep, and snoring loud.

â€˜what am i to do?â€™ exclaimed alice, looking about in great perplexity,
as first one round head, and then the other, rolled down from her
shoulder, and lay like a heavy lump in her lap. â€˜i donâ€™t think it ever
happened before,

rog muttered. â€˜vexes it,
you know.â€™ then he went up and gave the door a kick with one of his
great feet. â€˜you let it alone,â€™ he panted out, as he hobbled back to his
tree, â€˜and itâ€™ll let you alone, you know.â€™

at this moment the door was flung open, and a shrill voice was heard
singing:


   â€˜to the looking-glass world it was alice that said,
   â€œiâ€™ve a sceptre in hand, iâ€™ve a crown on my head;
   let the looking-glass creatures, whatever they be,
   come and dine with the red queen, the white queen, and me.â€â€™


and hundreds of voices joined in the chorus:


  â€˜then fill up the glasses as quick as you can,
  and sprinkle the table with buttons and bran:
  put cats in the coffee, and mice in the tea--
  and welcome queen alice with thirty-times-three!â€™


then followed a confused noise of cheering, and alice thought to
herself, â€˜thirty times three makes ninety. i wonder if any oneâ€™s
counting?â€™ in a minute there was silence again, and the same shrill
voice sang

another verse;


  â€˜â€œo looking-glass creatures,â€ quoth alice, â€œdraw near!
  â€˜tis an honour to see me, a favour to hear:
  â€˜tis a privilege high to have dinner and tea
  along with the red queen, the white queen, and me!â€â€™


then came the chorus again:--


  â€˜then fill up the glasses with treacle and ink,
  or anything else that is pleasant to drink:
  mix sand with the cider, and wool with the wine--
  and welcome queen alice with ninety-times-nine!â€™


â€˜ninety times nine!â€™ alice repeated in despair, â€˜oh, thatâ€™ll never
be done! iâ€™d better go in at once--â€™ and there was a dead silence the
moment she appeared.

alice glanced nervously along the table, as she walked up
 
 ___________________________
 
e about fifty guests, of all kinds: some
were animals, some birds, and there were even a few flowers among them.
â€˜iâ€™m glad theyâ€™ve come without waiting to be asked,â€™ she thought: â€˜i
should never have known who were the right people to invite!â€™

there were three chairs at the head of the table; the red and white
queens had already taken two of them, but the middle one was empty.
alice sat down in it, rather uncomfortable in the silence, and longing
for some one to speak.

at last the red queen began. â€˜youâ€™ve missed the soup and fish,â€™ she
said. â€˜put on the joint!â€™ and the waiters set a leg of mutton before
alice, who looked at it rather anxiously, as she had never had to carve
a joint before.

â€˜you look a little shy; let me introduce you to that leg of mutton,â€™
said the red queen. â€˜alice--mutton; mutton--alice.â€™ the leg of mutton
got up in the dish and made a little bow to alice; and alice returned
the bow, not knowing whether to be frightened or amused.

â€˜may i g

ive you a slice?â€™ she said, taking up the knife and fork, and
looking from one queen to the other.

â€˜certainly not,â€™ the red queen said, very decidedly: â€˜it isnâ€™t etiquette
to cut any one youâ€™ve been introduced to. remove the joint!â€™ and the
waiters carried it off, and brought a large plum-pudding in its place.

â€˜i wonâ€™t be introduced to the pudding, please,â€™ alice said rather
hastily, â€˜or we shall get no dinner at all. may i give you some?â€™

but the red queen looked sulky, and growled â€˜pudding--alice;
alice--pudding. remove the pudding!â€™ and the waiters took it away so
quickly that alice couldnâ€™t return its bow.

however, she didnâ€™t see why the red queen should be the only one to give
orders, so, as an experiment, she called out â€˜waiter! bring back the
pudding!â€™ and there it was again in a moment like a conjuring-trick. it
was so large that she couldnâ€™t help feeling a little shy with it, as she
had been with the mutton; however, she co

nquered her shyness by a great
effort and cut a slice and handed it to the red queen.

â€˜what impertinence!â€™ said the pudding. â€˜i wonder how youâ€™d like it, if i
were to cut a slice out of you, you creature!â€™

it spoke in a thick, suety sort of voice, and alice hadnâ€™t a word to say
in reply: she could only sit and look at it and gasp.

â€˜make a remark,â€™ said the red queen: â€˜itâ€™s ridiculous to leave all the
conversation to the pudding!â€™

â€˜do you know, iâ€™ve had such a quantity of poetry repeated to me to-day,â€™
alice began, a little frightened at finding that, the moment she opened
her lips, there was dead silence, and all eyes were fixed upon her; â€˜and
itâ€™s a very curious thing, i think--every poem was about fishes in some
way. do you know why theyâ€™re so fond of fishes, all about here?â€™

she spoke to the red queen, whose answer was a little wid

than a minute.
    â€œlet it lie in a dish!â€
   that is easy, because it already is in it.

    â€œbring it here! let me sup!â€
   it is easy to set such a dish on the table.
    â€œtake the dish-cover up!â€
   ah, that is so hard that i fear iâ€™m unable!

    for it holds it like glue--
  holds the lid to the dish, while it lies in the middle:
    which is easiest to do,
  un-dish-cover the fish, or dishcover the riddle?â€™


â€˜take a minute to think about it, and then guess,â€™ said the red queen.
â€˜meanwhile, weâ€™ll drink your health--queen aliceâ€™s health!â€™ she screamed
at the top of her voice, and all the guests began drinking it directly,
and very queerly they managed it: some of them put their glasses upon
their heads like extinguishers, and drank all that trickled down their
faces--others upset the decanters, and drank the wine as it ran off
the edges of the table--and three of them (who looked like kangaroos)
scrambled into the dish of roast mutton, and began eagerly lapping

 up
the gravy, â€˜just like pigs in a trough!â€™ thought alice.

â€˜you ought to return thanks in a neat speech,â€™ the red queen said,
frowning at alice as she spoke.

â€˜we must support you, you know,â€™ the white queen whispered, as alice got
up to do it, very obediently, but a little frightened.

â€˜thank you very much,â€™ she whispered in reply, â€˜but i can do quite well
without.â€™

â€˜that wouldnâ€™t be at all the thing,â€™ the red queen said very decidedly:
so alice tried to submit to it with a good grace.

(â€˜and they did push so!â€™ she said afterwards, when she was telling her
sister the history of the feast. â€˜you would have thought they wanted to
squeeze me flat!â€™)

in fact it was rather difficult for her to keep in her place while she
made her speech: the two queens pushed her so, one on each side, that
they nearly lifted her up into the air: â€˜i rise to return thanks--â€™
alice began: and she really did rise as she

here was not a moment to be lost. already several of the guests were
lying down in the dishes, and the soup ladle was walking up the table
towards aliceâ€™s chair, and beckoning to her impatiently to get out of
its way.

â€˜i canâ€™t stand this any longer!â€™ she cried as she jumped up and seized
the table-cloth with both hands: one good pull, and plates, dishes,
guests, and candles came crashing down together in a heap on the floor.

â€˜and as for you,â€™ she went on, turning fiercely upon the red queen, whom
she considered as the cause of all the mischief--but the queen was no
longer at her side--she had suddenly dwindled down to the size of a
little doll, and was now on the table, merrily running round and round
after her own shawl, which was trailing behind her.

at any other time, alice would have felt surprised at this, but she was
far too much excited to be surprised at anything now. â€˜as for you,â€™
she repeated, catching hold of the little creature in the very act of
jumping over a bo

forwards with all her might.

the red queen made no resistance whatever; only her face grew very
small, and her eyes got large and green: and still, as alice went on
shaking her, she kept on growing shorter--and fatter--and softer--and
rounder--and--

 ___________________________
 
kittens (alice had once made the
remark) that, whatever you say to them, they always purr. â€˜if they would
only purr for â€œyesâ€ and mew for â€œno,â€ or any rule of that sort,â€™ she had
said, â€˜so that one could keep up a conversation! but how can you talk
with a person if they always say the same thing?â€™

on this occasion the kitten only purred: and it was impossible to guess
whether it meant â€˜yesâ€™ or â€˜no.â€™

so alice hunted among the chessmen on the table till she had found the
red queen: then she went down on her knees on the hearth-rug, and put
the kitten and the queen to look at each other. â€˜now, kitty!â€™ she cried,
