[CHARACTER]
the play's title character is its protagonist, though an inconsistent one he disappears in act iv, seemingly replaced by mosca, and is first an instrument and then a victim of jonson's satire of money-obsessed society. he is an instrument of it because it is through his ingenuity and cleverness that voltore, corbaccio, and corvino are duped and he seems to share in jonson's satiric interpretation of the events, observing in i.v "what a rare punishment / is avarice to itself." but the satire eventually turns back on him, when he becomes a victim of mosca's "fox-trap." the reason he is ensnared by mosca is that he cannot resist one final gloat at his dupes, oblivious to the fact that in doing so, he hands over his entire estate to mosca. this lack of rational forethought and commitment to his own sensual impulses, is characteristic of [CHARACTER]. he enjoys entertainment, banquets, feasts, and love- making. he hates having to make money through honest labour or cold, heartless banking, but he loves making it in clever, deceitful ways, especially as a means toward food and lovemaking. he is a creature of passion, an imaginative hedonist continually looking to find and attain new forms of pleasure, whatever the consequences may be. this dynamic in his character shapes our reaction to him throughout the play. at times, this hedonism seems fun, engaging, entertaining, and even morally valuable, such as when he is engaged in the con on his fortune hunters. but his attempted seduction of celia reveals a darker side to his hedonism when it becomes an attempted rape. the incident makes him, in the moral universe of the play, a worthy target for satire, which is what he becomes in act v, when because of his lack of restraint he ends up on his way to prison, the most unpleasurable situation imaginable.
