 some, covetous
     above the rest, seek to engross me whole,
     and counter-work the one unto the other,
     contend in gifts, as they would seem in love:
     all which i suffer, playing with their hopes,
     and am content to coin them into profit,
     to look upon their kindness, and take more,
     and look on that; still bearing them in hand,
     letting the cherry knock against their lips,
     and draw it by their mouths, and back again.--
     how now!

     [re-enter mosca with nano, androgyno, and castrone.]

     nan: now, room for fresh gamesters, who do will you to know,
     they do bring you neither play, nor university show;
     and therefore do entreat you, that whatsoever they rehearse,
     may not fare a whit the worse, for the false pace of the verse.
     if you wonder at this, you will wonder more ere we pass,
     for know, here is inclosed the soul of pythagoras,
     that juggler divine, as hereafter shall follow;
     which soul, fast and loose, sir, cam

     fellow eunuch, as behoves us, with all our wit and art,
     to dignify that whereof ourselves are so great and special a part.

     volp: now, very, very pretty! mosca, this
     was thy invention?

     mos: if it please my patron,
     not else.

     volp: it doth, good mosca.

     mos: then it was, sir.

     nano and castrone [sing.]: fools, they are the only nation
     worth men's envy, or admiration:
     free from care or sorrow-taking,
     selves and others merry making:
     all they speak or do is sterling.
     your fool he is your great man's darling,
     and your ladies' sport and pleasure;
     tongue and bauble are his treasure.
     e'en his face begetteth laughter,
     and he speaks truth free from slaughter;
     he's the grace of every feast,
     and sometimes the chiefest guest;

     fellows of outside, and mere bark. you seem
     to be a gentleman, of ingenuous race:--
     i not profess it, but my fate hath been

     another man than has been phant'sied to you.
     i wonder yet, that he should mount his bank,
     here in this nook, that has been wont t'appear
     in face of the piazza!--here, he comes.

     but known this secret, they had never
