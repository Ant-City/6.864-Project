ckness; also 
there are other things more slimy than fish. even in the tunnels and caves the goblins 
have made for themselves there are other things living unbeknown to them that have 
sneaked in from outside to lie up in the dark. some of these caves, too, go back in their 
beginnings to ages before the goblins, who only widened them and joined them up with 
passages, and the original owners are still there in odd comers, slinking and nosing 
about. 
deep down here by the dark water lived old gollum, a small slimy creature. i don't know 
where he came from, nor who or what he was. he was gollum - as dark as darkness, 
except for two big round pale eyes in his thin face. he had a little boat, and he rowed 
about quite quietly on the lake; for lake it was, wide and deep and deadly cold. he 
paddled it with large feet dangling over the side, but never a ripple did he make. not he. 
he was looking out of his pale lamp-like eyes for blind fish, which he grabbed with his 
long fingers as quick a

he 
was prowling about. they very seldom did, for they had a feeling that something 
unpleasant was lurking down there, down at the very roots of the mountain. they had 
come on the lake, when they were tunneling down long ago, and they found they could 
go no further; so there their road ended in that direction, and there was no reason to go 
that way-unless the great goblin sent them. sometimes he took a fancy for fish from the 
lake, and sometimes neither goblin nor fish came back. 
actually gollum lived on a slimy island of rock in the middle of the lake. he was watching 
bilbo now from the distance with his pale eyes like telescopes. bilbo could not see him, 
but he was wondering a lot about bilbo, for he could see that he was no goblin at all. 
gollum got into his boat and shot off from the island, while bilbo was sitting on the brink 
altogether flummoxed and at the end of his way and his wits. suddenly up came gollum 
and whispered and hissed: 

"bless us and splash us, my preciouss

ss! i guess it's a choice feast; at least a tasty 
morsel it'd make us, gollum!" and when he said gollum he made a horrible swallowing 
noise in his throat. that is how he got his name, though he always called himself 'my 
precious.' 
the hobbit jumped nearly out of his skin when the hiss came in his ears, and he 
suddenly saw the pale eyes sticking out at him. 
"who are you?" he said, thrusting his dagger in front of him. 
"what iss he, my preciouss?" whispered gollum (who always spoke to himself through 
never having anyone else to speak to). this is what he had come to find out, for he was 
not really very hungry at the moment, only curious; otherwise he would have grabbed 
first and whispered afterwards. 
"i am mr. bilbo baggins. i have lost the dwarves and i have lost the wizard, and i don't 
know where i am; and "i don't want to know, if only i can get ,away." 
"what's he got in his handses?" said gollum, looking at the sword, which he did not quite

ke. 
"a sword, a blade which came out of gondolin!" 
"sssss," said gollum, and became quite polite. "praps ye sits here and chats with it a 
bitsy, my preciousss. it like riddles, praps it does, does it?" he was anxious to appear 
friendly, at any rate for the moment, and until he found out more about the sword and the 
hobbit, whether he was quite alone really, whether he was good to eat, and whether 
gollum was really hungry. 
riddles were all he could think of. asking them, and sometimes guessing them, had 
been the only game he had ever played with other funny creatures sitting in their holes in 
the long, long ago, before he lost all his friends and was driven away, alone, and crept 
down, down, into the dark under the mountains. 
"very well," said bilbo, who was anxious to agree, until he found out more about the 
creature, whether he was quite alone, whether he was fierce or hungry, and wheth

er he 
was a friend of the goblins. 
"you ask first," he said, because he had not had time to think of a riddle. 
so gollum hissed: 
 
"what has roots as nobody sees, 
is taller than trees, 
up, up it goes, 
and yet never grows?" 
 
"easy!" said bilbo. "mountain, i suppose." 
"does it guess easy? it must have a competition with us, my preciouss! if precious asks, 
and it doesn't answer, we eats it, my preciousss. if it asks us, and we doesn't answer, 
then we does what it wants, eh? we shows it the way out, yes!" 
"all right!" said bilbo, not daring to disagree, and nearly bursting his brain to think of 
riddles tha

t could save him from being eaten. 
 
"thirty white horses on a red hill, 
first they champ, 
then they stamp, 
then they stand still." 
 
that was all he could think of to ask-the idea of eating was rather on his mind. it was 
rather an old one, too, and gollum knew the answer as well as you do. 

"chestnuts, chestnuts," he hissed. "teeth! teeth! my preciousss; but we has only six!" 
then he asked his second: 
 
"voiceless it cries, 
wingless flutters, 
toothless bites, 
mouthless mutters." 
 
"half a moment!" cried bilbo, who was still thinking uncomfortably about eating. 
fortunately he had once heard something rather like this before, and getting his wits 
back he thought of the answer. "wind, wind of course," he said, and he was so pleased 
that

he made up one on the spot. "this'll puzzle the nasty little underground creature," 
he thought: 
 
"an eye in a blue face 
saw an eye in a green face. 
"that eye is like to this eye" 
said the first eye, 
"but in low place, 
not in high place."" 
 
"ss, ss, ss," said gollum. he had been underground a long long time, and was forgetting 
this sort of thing. but just as bilbo was beginning to hope that the wretch would not be 
able to answer, gollum brought up memories of ages and ages and ages before, when 
he lived with his grandmother in a hole in a bank by a river, "sss, sss, my preciouss," he 
said. "sun on the daisies it means, it does." 
but these ordinary aboveground everyday sort of riddles were tiring for him. also they 
reminded him of days when he had been less lonely and sneaky and nasty, and that put 
him out of temper. what is more they made him hungry; so this time he tried something 
a bit more difficult and more unpleasan

"it cannot be seen, cannot be felt, 
cannot be heard, cannot be smelt. 
it lies behind stars and under hills, 
and empty holes it fills. 
it comes first and follows after, 
ends life, kills laughter." 
 
unfortunately for gollum bilbo had heard that sort of thing before; and the answer was 
all round him anyway. "dark!" he said without even scratching his head or putting on his 
thinking cap. 
 
"a box without hinges, key, or lid, 
yet golden treasure inside is hid," 
 
he asked to gain time, until he could think of a really hard one. this he thought a 
dreadfully easy chestnut, though he had not asked it in the usual words. but it proved a 
nasty poser for gollum. he hissed to himself, and still he did not answer; he

whispered 
and spluttered. 
after some while bilbo became impatient. "well, what is it?" he said. 

"the answer's not a kettle boiling over, as you seem to think from the noise you are 
making." 
"give us a chance; let it give us a chance, my preciouss-ss-ss." 
"well," said bilbo, after giving him a long chance, "what about your guess?" 
but suddenly gollum remembered thieving from nests long ago, and sitting under the 
river bank teaching his grandmother, teaching his grandmother to suck-"eggses!" he 
hissed. "eggses it is!" then he asked: 
 
"a live without breath, 
as cold as death; 
never thirsty, ever drinking, 
all in mail never clinking." 
 
he also in his turn thought this was a dreadfully easy one, because he was always 
thinking of the answer. but he could not remember anything better at the moment, he 
was so flustered by the egg-questi

on. all the same it was a poser for poor bilbo, who 
never had anything to do with the water if he could help it. i imagine you know the 
answer, of course, or can guess it as easy as winking, since you are sitting comfortably 
at home and have not the danger of being eaten to disturb your thinking. bilbo sat and 
cleared his throat once or twice, but no answer came. 
after a while gollum began to hiss with pleasure to himself: "is it nice, my preciousss? is 
it juicy? is it scrumptiously crunchable?" he began to peer at bilbo out of the darkness. 
"half a moment," said the hobbit shivering. "i gave you a good long chance just now." 
"it must make haste, haste!" said gollum, beginning to climb out of his boat on to the 
shore to get at bilbo. but when he put his long webby foot in the water, a fish jumped out 
in a fright and fell on bilbo's toes. 
"ugh!" he said, "it is cold an

d clammy!"-and so he guessed. "fish! fish!" he cried. "it is 
fish!" 
gollum was dreadfully disappointed; but bilbo asked another riddle as quick as ever be 
could, so that gollum had to get back into his boat and think. 
"no-legs lay on one-leg, two-legs sat near on three-legs, four-legs got some." 
it was not really the right time for this riddle, but bilbo was in a hurry. gollum might have 
had some trouble guessing it, if he had asked it at another time. as it was, talking of fish, 
"no-legs" was not so very difficult, and after that the rest was easy. "fish on a little table, 
man at table sitting on a stool, the cat has the bones"-that of course is the answer, and 
gollum soon gave it. then he thought the time had come to ask something hard and 
horrible. this is what he said: 
 
"this thing all things devours: 
birds, beasts, trees, flowers; 
gnaws iron, bites stee

l; 
grinds hard stones to meal; 
slays king, ruins town, 
and beats high mountain down." 
 
poor bilbo sat in the dark thinking of all the horrible names of all the giants and ogres he 
had ever heard told of in tales, but not one of them had done all these things. he had a 
feeling that the answer was quite different and that he ought to know it, but he could not 
think of it. he began to get frightened, and that is bad for thinking. gollum began to get 
out of his boat. 

he flapped into the water and paddled to the bank; bilbo could see his eyes coming 
towards him. his tongue seemed to stick in his mouth; he wanted to shout out: "give me 
more time! give me time!" but all that came out with a sudden squeal was: 
"time! time!" 
bilbo was saved by pure luck. for that of course was the answer. 
gollum was disappointed once more; and now he was getting angry, and also tired of 
the game. it had made him very hungry indeed. this ti

me he did not go back to the boat. 
he sat down in the dark by bilbo. that made the hobbit most dreadfully uncomfortable 
and scattered his wits. 
"it's got to ask uss a quesstion, my preciouss, yes, yess, yesss. jusst one more 
quesstion to guess, yes, yess," said gollum. 
but bilbo simply could not think of any question with that nasty wet cold thing sitting next 
to him, and pawing and poking him. he scratched himself, he pinched himself; still he 
could not think of anything. 
"ask us! ask us!" said gollum. 
bilbo pinched himself and slapped himself; he gripped on his little sword; he even felt in 
his pocket with his other hand. there he found the ring he had picked up in the passage 
and forgotten about. 
"what have i got in my pocket?" he said aloud. he w

as talking to himself, but gollum 
thought it was a riddle, and he was frightfully upset. 
"not fair! not fair!" he hissed. "it isn't fair, my precious, is it, to ask us what it's got in its 
nassty little pocketses?" 
bilbo seeing what had happened and having nothing better to ask stuck to his question. 
"what have i got in my pocket?" he said louder. 
"s-s-s-s-s," hissed gollum. "it must give us three guesseses, my preciouss, three 
guesseses." 
"very well! guess away!" said bilbo. 
"handses!" said gollum. 
"wrong," said bilbo, who had luckily just taken his hand out again. "guess again!" 
"s-s-s-s-s," said gollum more upset than ever. he thought of all the things he kept in his 
own pockets: fishbones, goblins' teeth, wet shells, a bit of bat-wing, a sharp stone to 
sharpen his fangs on, and other nasty things. he tried to think what other people kept in 
their pocke

ts. 
"knife!" he said at last. 
"wrong!" said bilbo, who had lost his some time ago. "last guess!" 
now gollum was in a much worse state than when bilbo had asked him the egg-
question. he hissed and spluttered and rocked himself backwards and forwards, and 
slapped his feet on the floor, and wriggled and squirmed; but still he did not dare to 
waste his last guess. 
"come on!" said bilbo. "i am waiting!" he tried to sound bold and cheerful, but he did not 
feel at all sure how the game was going to end, whether gollum guessed right or not. 
"time's up!" he said. 
"string, or nothing!" shrieked gollum,

ved; and he jumped at once to his feet, put his 
back to the nearest wall, and held out his little sword. he knew, of course, that the riddle-
game was sacred and of immense antiquity, and even wicked creatures were afraid to 
cheat when they played at it. but he felt he could not trust this slimy thing to keep any 
promise at a pinch. any excuse would do for him to slide out of it. and after all that last 
question had not been a genuine riddle according to the ancient laws. 

but at any rate gollum did not at once attack him. he could see the sword in bilbo's 
hand. he sat still, shivering and whispering. at last bilbo could wait no longer. 
"well?" he said. "what about your promise? i want to go. you must show me the way." 
"did we say so, precious? show the nassty little baggins the way out, yes, yes. but what 
has it got in its pocketses, eh? not string, precious, but not nothing. oh no! gollum!" 
"never you mind," said bilbo. "a promise is a promise." 
"cross it is, impatient, preciou

s," hissed gollum. "but it must wait, yes it must. we can't 
go up the tunnels so hasty. we must go and get some things first, yes, things to help 
us." 
"well, hurry up!" said bilbo, relieved to think of gollum going away. he thought he was 
just making an excuse and did not mean to come back. what was gollum talking about? 
what useful thing could he keep out on the dark lake? 
but he was wrong. gollum did mean to come back. he was angry now and hungry. 
and he was a miserable wicked creature, and already he had a plan. 
not far away was his island, of which bilbo knew nothing, and there in his hiding-place 
he kept a few wretched oddments, and one very beautiful thing, very beautiful, very 
wonderful. he had a ring, a golden ring, a precious ring. 
"my birthday-present!" he whispered to himself, as he had often done in the endless dark 
days. "that's what we wants now, yes; we wants it!" 
he

 wanted it because it was a ring of power, and if you slipped that ring on your finger, 
you were invisible; only in the full sunlight could you be seen, and then only by your 
shadow, and that would be shaky and faint. 
"my birthday-present! it came to me on my birthday, my precious," so he had always 
said to himself. but who knows how gollum came by that present, ages ago in the old 
days when such rings were still at large in the world? 
perhaps even the master who ruled them could not have said. gollum used to wear it at 
first, till it tired him; and then he kept it in a pouch next his skin, till it galled him; and now 
usually he hid it in a hole in the rock on his island, and was always going back to look at 
it. and still sometimes he put it on, when he could not bear to be parted from it any 
longer, or when he was very, ver

softer. 
"quite safe, yes," he whispered to himself. "it won't see us, will it, my precious? no. it 
won't see us, and its nassty little sword will be useless, yes quite." 
that is what was in his wicked little mind, as he slipped suddenly from bilbo's side, and 
flapped back to his boat, and went off into the dark. bilbo thought he had heard the last 
of him. still he waited a while; for he had no idea how to find his way out alone. 
suddenly he heard a screech. it sent a shiver down his back. gollum was cursing and 
wailing away in the gloom, not very far off by the sound of it. he was on his island, 
scrabbling here and there, searching and seeking in vain. 
"where is it? where iss it?" bilbo heard him crying. "losst it is, my precious, lost, lost! 
curse us and crush us, my precious is lost!" 
"what's the matter?" bilbo called. "what have you lost?" 
"it mustn't ask us," shrieked gollum. "not its business, no, gollum! it's losst, gollum, 
gollum, gollum." 
"well, so am i," cried bilbo, "
 
 ___________________________
 
and i want to get unlost. and i won the game, and you 
promised. so come along! come and let me out, and then go on with your looking!" 

utterly miserable as gollum sounded, bilbo could not find much pity in his heart, and he 
had a feeling that anything gollum wanted so much could hardly be something good. 
"come along!" he shouted. 
"no, not yet, precious!" gollum answered. "we must search for it, it's lost, gollum." 
"but you never guessed my last question, and you promised," said bilbo. 
"never guessed!" said gollum. then suddenly out of the gloom came a sharp hiss. 
"what has it got in its pocketses? tell us that. it must tell first." 
as far as bilbo knew, there was no particular reason why he should not tell. gollum's 
mind had jumped to a guess quicker than his; naturally, for gollum had brooded for ages 
on this one thing, and he was always afraid of its being stolen. but bilbo was annoyed at 
the 
 
 ___________________________
 
delay. after all, he had won the game, pretty fairly, at a horrible risk. "answers were 
to be guessed not given," he said. 
"but it wasn't a fair question," said gollum. "not a riddle, precious, no." 
"oh well, if it's a matter of ordinary questions," bilbo replied, "then i asked one first. what 
have you lost? tell me that!" 
"what has it got in its pocketses?" the sound came hissing louder and sharper, and as 
he looked towards it, to his alarm bilbo now saw two small points of light peering at him. 
as suspicion grew in gollum's mind, the light of his eyes burned with a pale flame. 
"what have you lost?" bilbo persisted. but now the light in gollum's eyes h

ad become a 
green fire, and it was coming swiftly nearer. gollum was in his boat again, paddling 
wildly back to the dark shore; and such a rage of loss and suspicion was in his heart that 
no sword had any more terror for him. 
bilbo could not guess what had maddened the wretched creature, but he saw that all 
was up, and that gollum meant to murder him at any rate. just in time he turned and ran 
blindly back up the dark passage down which he had come, keeping close to the wall 
and feeling it with his left hand. 
"what has it got in its pocketses?" he heard the hiss loud behind him, and the splash as 
gollum leapt from his boat. 
"what have i, i wonder?" he said to himself, as he panted and stumbled along. he put 
his left hand in his pocket. the ring felt very cold as it quietly slipped on to his groping 
forefinger. 
th
 
 ___________________________
 
e hiss was close behind him. he turned now and saw gollum's eyes like small green 
lamps coming up the slope. terrified he tried to run faster, but suddenly he struck his 
toes on a snag in the floor, and fell flat with his little sword under him. 
in a moment gollum was on him. but before bilbo could do anything, recover his breath, 
pick himself up, or wave his sword, gollum passed by, taking no notice of him, cursing 
and whispering as he ran. 
what could it mean? gollum could see in the dark. bilbo could see the light of his eyes 
palely shining even from behind. painfully he got up, and sheathed his sword, which was 
now glowing faintly again, then very cautiously he followed. there seemed nothing else 
to do. it was no good crawling back down to gollum's water. perhaps if he followed him, 
gollum might lead him to some way of escape without meaning to. 
"curse it! curse it! curse it!" hissed gollum. "curse the baggins! it's gone! what has it got 
in its pock

etses? oh we guess, we guess, my precious. 
he's found it, yes he must have. my birthday-present." 
bilbo pricked up his ears. he was at last beginning to guess himself. h^ hurried a little, 
getting as close as he dared behind gollum, who was still going quickly, not looking 
back, but turning his head from side to side, as bilbo could see from the faint glimmer on 
the walls. 

"my birthday-present! curse it! how did we lose it, my precious? yes, that's it. when we 
came this way last, when we twisted that nassty young squeaker. that's it. curse it! it 
slipped from us, after all these ages and ages! it's gone, gollum." 
suddenly gollum sat down and began to weep, a whistling and gurgling sound horrible 
to listen to. bil

bo halted and flattened himself against the tunnel-wall. after a while 
gollum stopped weeping and began to talk. he seemed to be having an argument with 
himself. 
"it's no good going back there to search, no. we doesn't remember all the places we've 
visited. and it's no use. the baggins has got it in its pocketses; the nassty noser has 
found it, we says." 
"we guesses, precious, only guesses. we can't know till we find the nassty creature and 
squeezes it. but it doesn't know what the present can do, does it? it'll just keep it in its 
pocketses. it doesn't know, and

it can't go far. it's lost itself, the nassty nosey thing. it 
doesn't know the way out it said so." 
"it said so, yes; but it's tricksy. it doesn't say what it means. it won't say what it's got in its 
pocketses. it knows. it knows a way in, it must know a way out, yes. it's off to the back-
door. to the back-door, that's it." 
"the goblinses will catch it then. it can't get out that way, precious." 
"ssss, sss, gollum! goblinses! yes, but if it's got the present, our precious present, then 
goblinses will get it, gollum! they'll find it, they'll find out what it does. we shan't ever be 
safe again, never, gollum! one of the goblinses will put it on, and then no one will see 
him. he'll be there but not seen. not even our clever eyeses will notice him; and he'll 
come creepsy and tricksy and catch us, gollum, gollum!" 
"then let's stop talking, precious, and make haste. if the baggins has gone that way, we

ust go quick and see. go! not far now. make haste!" 
with a spring gollum got up and started shambling off at a great pace. 
bilbo hurried after him, still cautiously, though his chief fear now was of tripping on 
another snag and falling with a noise. his head was in a whirl of hope and wonder. it 
seemed that the ring he had was a magic ring: it made you invisible! he had heard of 
such things, of course, in old old tales; but it was hard to believe that he really had found 
one, by accident. still there it was: gollum with his bright eyes had passed him by, only a

yard to one side. 
on they went, gollum flip-flapping ahead, hissing and cursing; bilbo behind going as 
softly as a hobbit can. soon they came to places where, as bilbo had noticed on the way 
down, side-passages opened, this way and that. 
gollum began at once to count them. 
"one left, yes. one right, yes. two right, yes, yes. two left, yes, yes." and so on and on. 
as the count grew he slowed down, and he began to get shaky and weepy; for he was 
leaving the water further and further behind, and he was getting afraid. goblins might be 
about, and he had lost his ring. at last he stopped by a low opening, on their left as they 
went up. 
"seven right, yes. six left, yes!" he whispered. "this is it. this is the way to the back-
door, ye

s. here's the passage!" 
he peered in, and shrank back. "but we durstn't go in, precious, no we durstn't. 
goblinses down there. lots of goblinses. we smells them. ssss!" 
"what shall we do? curse them and crush them! we must wait here, precious, wait a bit 
and see." 
so they came to a dead stop. gollum had brought bilbo to the way out after all, but bilbo 
could not get in! there was gollum sitting humped up right in the opening, and his eyes 
gleamed cold in his head, as he swayed it from side to side between his knees. 

bilbo crept away from the wall more quietly than a mouse; but gollum stiffened at once, 
and sniffed, and his eyes went green. he hissed softly but menacingly. he could not see 
the hobbit, but now he was on the alert, and he had other senses that the darkness had 
sharpened: hearing and smell. he seemed to be crouched right down with his flat hands 
splayed on

loor, and his head thrust out, nose almost to the stone. though he was 
only a black shadow in the gleam of his own eyes, bilbo could see or feel that he was 
tense as a bowstring, gathered for a spring. 
bilbo almost stopped breathing, and went stiff himself. he was desperate. 
he must get away, out of this horrible darkness, while he had any strength left. he must 
fight. he must stab the foul thing, put its eyes out, kill it. 
it meant to kill him. no, not a fair fight. he was invisible now. gollum had no sword. 
gollum had not actually threatened to kill him, or tried to yet. and he was miserable, 
alone, lost. a sudden understanding, a pity mixed with horror, welled up in bilbo's heart: 
a glimpse of endless unmarked days without light or hope of betterment, hard stone, 
cold fish, sneaking and whispering. 
all these thoughts passed in a flash of a second. he trembled. and then quite suddenly 
in another flash, as if lifted by a new strength and resolve, he leaped. 
no great leap for a

man, but a leap in the dark. straight over gollum's head he jumped, 
seven feet forward and three in the air; indeed, had he known it, he only just missed 
cracking his skull on the low arch of the passage. 
gollum threw himself backwards, and grabbed as the hobbit flew over him, but too late: 
his hands snapped on thin air, and bilbo, falling fair on his sturdy feet, sped off down the 
new tunnel. he did not turn to see what gollum was doing. there was a hissing and 
cursing almost at his heels at first, then it stopped. all at once there came a 
bloodcurdling shriek, filled with hatred and despair. gollum was defeated. he dared go 
no further. he had lost: lost his prey, and lost, too, the only thing he had ever cared for, 
his precious. 
the cry brought bilbo's heart to his mouth, but still he held on. now faint as an echo, but 
menacing, the voice came behind: 
"thief, thief, thief! baggins! we hates it, we hates it, w

ed, and then suddenly he saw the goblins: goblins in full armour with drawn 
swords sitting just inside the door, and watching it with wide eyes, and watching the 
passage that led to it. they were aroused, alert, ready for anything. 

they saw him sooner than he saw them. yes, they saw him. whether it was an accident, 
or a last trick of the ring before it took a new master, it was not on his finger. with yells of 
delight the goblins rushed upon him. 
a pang of fear and loss, like an echo of gollum's misery, smote bilbo, and forgetting 
even to draw his sword he struck his hands into his pockets. 
and- there was the ring still, in his left pocket, and it slipped on his finger. the goblins 
stopped short. they could not see a sign of him. he had vanished. they yelled twice as 
loud as before, but not so delightedly. 
"where is it?" they cried. 
"go back up the passage!" some shouted. 
"this way!" some yelled. "that way!" others yelled. 
"look out for the door," bellowed the captain.

did. 
"balin at your service," said he. 
"your servant, mr. baggins," said bilbo. 
then they wanted to know all about his adventures after they had lost him, and he sat 
down and told them everything-except about the finding of the ring ("not just now" he 
thought). they were particularly interested in the riddle-competition, and shuddered most 
appreciatively at his description of gollum. 
"and then i couldn't think of any other question with him sitting beside me," ended bilbo; 
"so i said 'what's in my pocket?' and he couldn't guess in three goes. so i said: 'what 
about your promise? show me the way out!' but he came at me to kill me, and i ran, and 
fell over, and he missed me in the dark. 
then i followed him, because i heard him talking to himself. he thought i really knew the 
way out, and so he was making for it. and then he sat down in the entrance, and i could

t by. so i jumped over him and escaped, and ran down to the gate." 
"what about guards?" they asked. "weren't there any?" 
"o yes! lots of them; but i dodged 'em. i got stuck in the door, which was only open a 
crack, and i lost lots of buttons," he said sadly looking at his torn clothes. "but i 
squeezed through all right-and here i am." 
the dwarves looked at him with quite a new respect, when he talked about dodging 
guards, jumping over gollum, and squeezing through, as if it was not very difficult or 
very alarming. 
"what did i tell you?" said gandalf laughing. "mr. baggins has more about him than you 
guess." he gave bilbo a queer look from under his bushy eyebrows, as he said this, and 
the hobbit wondered if he guessed at the part of his tale that he had left out. 
then he had questions of his own to ask, for if gandalf had explained it all by now to the 
dwarves, bilbo had not heard it. he wanted to know how the wizard had turn

ic lingered in such spots, which the spiders did not 
like. at any rate here the light was greener, and the boughs less thick and threatening, 
and they had a chance to rest and draw breath. 
there they lay for some time, puffing and panting. put very soon they began to ask 
questions. they had to have the whole vanishing business carefully explained, and the 
finding of the ring interested them so much that for a while they forgot their own troubles. 
balin in particular insisted on having the gollum story, riddles and all, told all over again, 
with the ring in its proper place. but after a time the light began to fail, and then other 
questions were asked. where were they, and where was their path, and where was 
there any food, and what were they going to do next? these questions they asked over 
and over again, and it was from little bilbo that they seemed to expect to get the 
answers. from which you can see that they had changed their opinion of mr. baggins 
very much, and had begun t

but there was nothing, nothing at all; and none of them were fit to go and look for 
anything, or to search for the lost path. the lost path! no other idea would come into 
bilbo's tired head. he just sat staring in front of him at the endless trees; and after a 
while they all fell silent again. all except balin. long after the others had stopped talking 
and shut their eyes, he kept on muttering and chuckling to himself. 
"gollum! well i'm blest! so that's how he sneaked past me is it? now i know! just crept 
quietly along did you, mr. baggins? buttons all over the doorstep? good old bilbo-bilbo-
bilbo-bo-bo-bo-" and then he fell asleep, and there was complete silence for a long time. 
all of a sudden dwalin opened an eye, and looked round at them. "where is thorin?" he 
asked. it was a terrible shock. of course there were only thirteen of them, twelve 
dwarves and the hobbit. where indeed was thorin? they wondered what
