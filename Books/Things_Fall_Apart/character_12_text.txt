is good fortune had gone to his head. they called him the little
bird nza who so far forgot himself after a heavy meal that he
challenged his chi.

no work was done during the week of peace. people called on
their neighbors and drank palm-wine. this year they talked of
nothing else but the nso-ani which okonkwo had committed. it
was the first time for many years that a man had broken the sacred
peace. even the oldest men could only remember one or two other
occasions somewhere in the dim past.

ogbuefi ezeudu, who was the oldest man in the village, was telling
two other men who came to visit him that the punishment for
breaking the peace of ani had become very mild in their clan.




"it has not always been so," he said. "my father told me that he had
been told that in the past a man who broke the peace was dragged
