_sec. mer._ you know since pentecost the sum is due,
and since i have not much importuned you;
nor now i had not, but that i am bound

or i’ll attach you by this officer.

_ang._ even just the sum that i do owe to you

and in the instant that i met with you
he had of me a chain: at five o’clock
