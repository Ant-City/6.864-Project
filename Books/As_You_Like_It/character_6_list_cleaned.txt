[CHARACTER] - 
                 a
clown in duke frederick's court who accompanies rosalind and celia
in their flight to ardenne. although [CHARACTER]'s job, as fool,
is to criticize the behavior and point out the folly of those around
him, [CHARACTER] fails to do so with even a fraction of rosalind's
grace. next to his mistress, the clown seems hopelessly vulgar and
narrow-minded. almost every line he speaks echoes with bawdy innuendo.
