the hell sauniere was trying to say. if a code breaker had now arrived, it most likely meant
someone had decrypted sauniere's message.

"i'm busy at the moment," fache radioed back, leaving no doubt in his tone that a line had been
crossed. "ask the cryptographer to wait at the command post. i'll speak to him when i'm done."

"her, " the voice corrected. "it's agent neveu."

fache was becoming less amused with this call every passing moment. sophie neveu was one of
dcpj's biggest mistakes. a young parisian dechiffreuse who had studied cryptography in england
at the royal holloway, sophie neveu had been foisted on fache two years ago as part of the
ministry's attempt to incorporate more women into the police force. the ministry's ongoing foray
into political correctness, fache argued, was weakening the department. women not only lacked
the physicality necessary for police work, but their mere presence posed a dangerous distraction to
the men in

the field. as fache had feared, sophie neveu was proving far more distracting than
most.

at thirty-two years old, she had a dogged determination that bordered on obstinate. her eager
espousal of britain's new cryptologic methodology continually exasperated the veteran french
cryptographers above her. and by far the most troubling to fache was the inescapable universal
truth that in an office of middle-aged men, an attractive young woman always drew eyes away
from the work at hand.

the man on the radio said, "agent neveu insisted on spea

hushed tones. disliking the captain more and more, langdon turned away from the odd
confrontation and switched on the cell phone. checking the slip of paper sophie had given him,
langdon dialed the number.

the line began to ring.

one ring... two rings... three rings...

finally the call connected.

langdon expected to hear an embassy operator, but he found himself instead listening to an
answering machine. oddly, the voice on the tape was familiar. it was that of sophie neveu.

"bonjour, vous etes bien chez sophie neveu, " the woman's voice said. "je suis absenle pour le
moment, mais..."

confused, langdon turned back toward sophie. "i'm sorry, ms. neveu? i think you may have
given me — "

"no, that's the right number," sophie interjected quickly, as if anticipating langdon's confusion.
"the embassy has an automated message system. you have to dial an access code to pick up your



messages.

langdon stared. "but — "

"it's the three-digit code on the paper i ga

the bishop smiled. "a fine point. our desires are in accord. godspeed."

twenty million euro, the bishop thought, now gazing out the plane's window. the sum was
approximately the same number of u.s. dollars. a pittance for something so powerful.

he felt a renewed confidence that the teacher and silas would not fail. money and faith were



powerful motivators.



chapter 11

"une plaisanterie numerique?" bezu fache was livid, glaring at sophie neveu in disbelief. a
numeric joke? "your professional assessment of sauniere's code is that it is some kind of
mathematical prank?"

fache was in utter incomprehension of this woman's gall. not only had she just barged in on fache
without permission, but she was now trying to convince him that sauniere, in his final moments of
life, had been inspired to leave a mathematical gag?

"this code," sophie explained in rapid french, "is simplistic to the point of absurdity. jacques

sophie's soft features grew surprisingly stern as she leaned in. "captain, considering what you have
at stake here tonight, i thought you might appreciate knowing that jacques sauniere might be
playing games with you. apparently not. i'll inform the director of cryptography you no longer
need our services."

with that, she turned on her heel, and marched off the way she had come.

stunned, fache watched her disappear into the darkness. is she out of her mind? sophie neveu had
just redefined le suicide professionnel.

fache turned to langdon, who was still on the phone, looking more concerned than before,
listening intently to his phone message. the u.s. embassy. bezu fache despised many things... but
few drew more wrath than the u.s. embassy.

fache and the ambassador locked horns regularly over shared affairs of state — their most common
battleground being law enforcement for visiting americans. almost daily, dcpj arrested american
exchange students in posses

it.



"i need to return to mr. sauniere's office for a moment," fache said. "please come find me directly,
mr. langdon. there is more we need to discuss."

langdon gave a quiet wave as he disappeared into the darkness.

turning, fache marched angrily in the opposite direction. arriving at the gate, he slid under, exited
the grand gallery, marched down the hall, and stormed into the command center at sauniere's
office.

"who gave the approval to let sophie neveu into this building!" fache bellowed.

collet was the first to answer. "she told the guards outside she'd broken the code."

fache looked around. "is she gone?"

"she's not with you?"



"she left." fache glanced out at the darkened hallway. apparently sophie had been in no mood to
stop by and chat with the other officers on her way out.

for a moment, fache considered radioing the guards in the entresol and telling them to stop sophie
and drag her back up here before she could leave the premise

international stick-figure symbols for rest rooms guided him through a maze-like series
of dividers displaying italian drawings and hiding the rest rooms from sight.



finding the men's room door, langdon entered and turned on the lights.

the room was empty.

walking to the sink, he splashed cold water on his face and tried to wake up. harsh fluorescent
lights glared off the stark tile, and the room smelled of ammonia. as he toweled off, the rest room's
door creaked open behind him. he spun.

sophie neveu entered, her green eyes flashing fear. "thank god you came. we don't have much
time."

langdon stood beside the sinks, staring in bewilderment at dcpj cryptographer sophie neveu.
only minutes ago, langdon had listened to her phone message, thinking the newly arrived
cryptographer must be insane. and yet, the more he listened, the more he sensed sophie neveu
was speaking in earnest. do not react to this message. just listen calmly. you are in danger right
now. follow my directions very closely.

langdon needed a minute to process that one. "i beg your pardon?"

"that message wasn't for the police. he wrote it for me. i think he was forced to do everything in
such a hurry that he just didn't realize how it would look to the police." she paused. "the numbered
code is meaningless. sauniere wrote it to make sure the investigation included cryptographers,
ensuring that / would know as soon as possible what had happened to him."

langdon felt himself losing touch fast. whether or not sophie neveu had lost her mind was at this
point up for grabs, but at least langdon now understood why she was trying to help him. p.s. find
robert langdon. she apparently believed the curator had left her a cryptic postscript telling her to
find langdon. "but why do you think his message was for you?"

"the vitruvian man, " she said flatly. "that particular sketch has always been my favorite da vinci
work. tonight he used it to catch my attention."

"hold on. you're saying the curator knew your favorite pi

ece of art?" she nodded. "i'm sorry. this
is all coming out of order. jacques sauniere and i..."

sophie's voice caught, and langdon heard a sudden melancholy there, a painful past, simmering
just below the surface. sophie and jacques sauniere apparently had some kind of special
relationship. langdon studied the beautiful young woman before him, well aware that aging men in
france often took young mistresses. even so, sophie neveu as a "kept woman" somehow didn't
seem to fit.

"we had a falling-out ten years ago," sophie said, her voice a whisper now. "we've barely spoken
since. tonight, when crypto got the call that he had been murdered, and i saw the images of his
body and text on the floor, i realized he was trying to send me a message."

"because of the vitruvian man?"

"yes. and the letters p.s."

"postscript?"



she shook her head. "p.s. are my initials."

"but your name is sophie neveu."

she looked away. "p.s. i

 arrest of an american would go a long way to silence fache's critics,
helping him secure the job a few more years until he could retire with the lucrative pension. god

professionally and personally. fache was rumored to have invested his entire savings in the
technology craze a few years back and lost his shirt. and fache is a man who wears only the finest
shirts.

tonight, there was still plenty of time. sophie neveu's odd interruption, though unfortunate, had
been only a minor wrinkle. she was gone now, and fache still had cards to play. he had yet to
inform langdon that his name had been scrawled on the floor by the victim. p.s. find robert
langdon. the american's reaction to that little bit of evidence would be telling indeed.

"captain?" one of the dcpj agents now called from across the office. "i think you better take this

grandfather graduated her to crosswords in english, mathematical puzzles, and substitution ciphers.
sophie devoured them all. eventually she turned her passion into a profession by becoming a
codebreaker for the judicial police.

tonight, the cryptographer in sophie was forced to respect the efficiency with which her
grandfather had used a simple code to unite two total strangers — sophie neveu and robert
langdon.

the question was why?

unfortunately, from the bewildered look in langdon's eyes, sophie sensed the american had no
more idea than she did why her grandfather had thrown them together.

she pressed again. "you and my grandfather had planned to meet tonight. what about?"

langdon looked truly perplexed. "his secretary set the meeting and didn't offer any specific reason,

understandably upset by the photos."

"upset? she's never seen a picture of a dead body?"

fache was silent a moment. "i was not aware of this, and it seems neither was the director until a
coworker informed him, but apparently sophie neveu is jacques sauniere's granddaughter."

collet was speechless.

"the director said she never once mentioned sauniere to him, and he assumed it was because she
probably didn't want preferential treatment for having a famous grandfather."

no wonder she was upset by the pictures. collet could barely conceive of the unfortunate
coincidence that called in a young woman to decipher a code written by a dead family member.
still, her actions made no sense. "but she obviously recognized the numbers as f

fleeing the men's room, they moved into the shadows just as fache rushed past.



now, with the fire alarm silenced, langdon could hear the sounds of dcpj sirens tearing away
from the louvre. a police exodus. fache had hurried off as well, leaving the grand gallery
deserted.

"there's an emergency stairwell about fifty meters back into the grand gallery," sophie said.
"now that the guards are leaving the perimeter, we can get out of here."

langdon decided not to say another word all evening. sophie neveu was clearly a hell of a lot
smarter than he was.

ho the hell did he call?

it was at that moment, eyeing his cellular phone, that fache realized the answers were in the palm
of his hand. langdon used my phone to place that call.

keying into the cell phone's menu, fache pulled up the list of recently dialed numbers and found
the call langdon had placed.

a paris exchange, followed by the three-digit code 454.

redialing the phone number, fache waited as the line began ringing.



finally a woman's voice answered. "bonjour, vous etes bien chez sophie neveu, " the recording
announced. "je suis absente pour le moment, mais..."

fache's blood was boiling as he typed the numbers 4... 5... 4.

despite her monumental reputation, the mona lisa was a mere thirty-one inches by twenty-one

at that moment, langdon saw a faint purple glimmer on the protective glass before the mona lisa.

they both froze.

seated at sauniere's desk, lieutenant collet pressed the phone to his ear in disbelief. did i hear
fache correctly? "a bar of soap? but how could langdon have known about the gps dot?"

"sophie neveu," fache replied. "she told him."

"what! why?"



"damned good question, but i just heard a recording that confirms she tipped him off."

collet was speechless. what was neveu thinking? fache had proof that sophie had interfered with
a dcpj sting operation? sophie neveu was not only going to be fired, she was also going to jail.
"but, captain... then where is langdon now?"

"have any fire alarms gone off there?"

"no, sir."

and i don't want langdon breaking for an exit." fache paused. "and you'd better tell the guard
agent neveu is probably in there with him."

"agent neveu left, i thought."

"did you actually see her leave?"

"no, sir, but—"

"well, nobody on the perimeter saw her leave either. they only saw her go in."

collet was flabbergasted by sophie neveu's bravado. she's still inside the building?

"handle it," fache ordered. "i want langdon and neveu at gunpoint by the time i get back."



as the trailor truck drove off, captain fache rounded up his men. robert langdon had proven an
elusive quarry tonight, and with agent neveu now helping him, he might be far harder to corner
than expected.



fache decided not to take any chances.

hedging his bets, he ordered half of his men back to the louvre perimeter. the other half he sent to

"c'est mot," the voice responded in calm french. "sophie neveu. "

somewhere in the distant recesses of grouard's mind, the name registered. sophie neveu? that
was the name of sauniere's granddaughter, wasn't it? she used to come in here as a little kid, but
that was years ago. this couldn't possibly be her! and even if it were sophie neveu, that was
hardly a reason to trust her; grouard had heard the rumors of the painful falling-out between
sauniere and his granddaughter.

grouard gasped, realizing which painting it was.

what in the name of god is she doing?



across the room, sophie neveu felt a cold sweat breaking across her forehead. langdon was still
spread-eagle on the floor. hold on, robert. almost there. knowing the guard would never actually
shoot either of them, sophie now turned her attention back to the matter at hand, scanning the
entire area around one masterpiece in particular — another da vinci. but the uv light revealed
nothing out of the ordinary. not on the floor, on the walls, or even on the canvas itself.

sophie guided langdon toward the ticket window and said, "buy us two tickets with your credit

"i thought credit card usage could be traced by — "

"exactly."

langdon decided to stop trying to keep ahead of sophie neveu. using his visa card, he purchased
two coach tickets to lyon and handed them to sophie.

sophie guided him out toward the tracks, where a familiar tone chimed overhead and a p.a.
announcer gave the final boarding call for lyon. sixteen separate tracks spread out before them. in



the distance to the right, at quay three, the train to lyon was belching and wheezing in preparation
for departure, but sophie already had her arm through langdon's and was guiding him in the exact
opposite direction.

"arretez! " sophie commanded the driver.

trembling, the driver obeyed, stopping the car and putting it in park.

it was then that langdon heard the metallic voice of the taxi company's dispatcher coming from the

langdon stood up. sophie jumped to her feet as well. the voice had come from the top of a curled
staircase that snaked up to the shadows of the second floor. at the top of the stairs, a form moved
in the shadows, only his silhouette visible.

"good evening," langdon called up. "sir leigh, may i present sophie neveu."

"an honor." teabing moved into the light.

crutches. he was coming down one stair at a time. "i realize it's quite late."

made perfect sense that he would tell collet not to make a move. the last thing fache needed was
for collet to storm an innocent brit's private estate and take langdon at gunpoint.

moreover, collet realized, if langdon were innocent, it explained one of this case's strangest
paradoxes: why had sophie neveu, the granddaughter of the victim, helped the alleged killer
escape? unless sophie knew langdon was falsely charged. fache had posited all kinds of
explanations tonight to explain sophie's odd behavior, including that sophie, as sauniere's sole
heir, had persuaded her secret lover robert langdon to kill off sauniere for the inheritance money.

as he fell, he thought for a moment he saw a pale ghost hovering over him, clutching a gun. then
everything went black.

sophie neveu, despite working in law enforcement, had never found herself at gunpoint until
tonight. almost inconceivably, the gun into which she was now staring was clutched in the pale
hand of an enormous albino with long white hair. he looked at her with red eyes that radiated a
frightening, disembodied quality. dressed in a wool robe with a rope tie, he resembled a medieval
cleric. sophie could not imagine who he was, and yet she was feeling a sudden newfound respect

teabing pretended not to hear her. "robert, you said earlier that you thought you'd seen something

langdon looked vexed. "i thought so. i'm not sure. the script looks familiar somehow."

"leigh?" sophie repeated, clearly not appreciating being left out of the discussion. "might i have a
look at the box my grandfather made?"

"of course, dear," teabing said, pushing it over to her. he hadn't meant to sound belittling, and yet
sophie neveu was light-years out of her league. if a british royal historian and a harvard
symbologist could not even identify the language —

"aah," sophie said, seconds after examining the box. "i should have guessed."

teabing and langdon turned in unison, staring at her.

"guessed what?" teabing demanded.

sophie shrugged. "guessed that this would be the language my grandfather would have used."

"you're saying you can read this text?" teabing exclaimed.

langdon now recognized the emotion that had been growing in her eyes as they spoke. it was
remorse. distant and deep. sophie neveu had shunned her grandfather and was now seeing him in
an entirely different light.

the next thing the boy knew, he was sprinting across the outside courtyard with no plans of

could turn, silas pressed the gun barrel into her spine and wrapped a powerful arm across her chest,
pulling her back against his hulking body. she yelled in surprise. teabing and langdon both turned
now, their expressions astonished and fearful.

sophie paused. "agent sophie neveu with the french judicial police."

the title had the desired effect. "right away, ma'am. let me get a detective on the line for you."

 being bugged. he
looked at the rest of the list again. how could anyone possibly manage to bug these prominent
people? "have you heard any of the audio files?"

"a few. here's one of the most recent." the agent clicked a few computer keys. the speakers
crackled to life. "capitaine, un agent du departement de cryptographic est arrive. "

collet could not believe his ears. "that's me! that's my voice!" he recalled sitting at sauniere's
desk and radioing fache in the grand gallery to alert him of sophie neveu's arrival.

the agent nodded. "a lot of our louvre investigation tonight would have been audible if someone
had been interested."

"have you sent anyone in to sweep for the bug?"



"no need. i know exactly where it is." the agent went to a pile of old notes and blueprints on the
worktable. he selected a page and handed it to collet. "look familiar?"

collet was amazed. he was holding a photocopy of an ancient schematic diagram, which depicted
a rudimentary machine. he was unable to read the ha

elevision as well, but the librarian's smile
suggested otherwise. langdon still had not gotten used to these moments of unexpected celebrity.
then again, if anyone on earth were going to recognize his face, it would be a librarian in a
religious studies reference facility.

"pamela gettum," the librarian said, offering her hand. she had a genial, erudite face and a
pleasingly fluid voice. the horn-rimmed glasses hanging around her neck were thick.

"a pleasure," langdon said. "this is my friend sophie neveu."

the two women greeted one another, and gettum turned immediately back to langdon. "i didn't
know you were coming."

"neither did we. if it's not too much trouble, we could really use your help finding some
information."

gettum shifted, looking uncertain. "normally our services are by petition and appointment only,
unless of course you're the guest of someone at the college?"

langdon shook his head. "i'm afraid we've come unannounced. a friend of mine speaks very
highly of you. sir leigh te

calculating the current number of hits and multiplying by the percentage of the database left to
search, provided a rough guess of how much information would be found. this particular search
looked like it was going to return an obscenely large amount of data.

estimated number of total hits: 2,692



"we need to refine the parameters further," gettum said, stopping the search. "is this all the
information you have regarding the tomb? there's nothing else to go on?"

langdon glanced at sophie neveu, looking uncertain.

this is no scavenger hunt, gettum sensed. she had heard the whisperings of robert langdon's
experience in rome last year. this american had been granted access to the most secure library on
earth — the vatican secret archives. she wondered what kinds of secrets langdon might have
learned inside and if his current desperate hunt for a mysterious london tomb might relate to
information he had gained within the vatican. gettum had been a librarian long enough to know

ed looks.

gettum laughed. "my friends, this library is a base camp for grail seekers. leigh teabing among
them. i wish i had a shilling for every time i'd run searches for the rose, mary magdalene,
sangreal, merovingian, priory of sion, et cetera, et cetera. everyone loves a conspiracy." she took
off her glasses and eyed them. "i need more information."



in the silence, gettum sensed her guests' desire for discretion was quickly being outweighed by
their eagerness for a fast result.

"here," sophie neveu blurted. "this is everything we know." borrowing a pen from langdon, she
wrote two more lines on the slip of paper and handed it to gettum.

you seek the orb that ought be on his tomb.
it speaks of rosy flesh and seeded womb.



gettum gave an inward smile. the grail indeed, she thought, noting the references to the rose and
her seeded womb. "i can help you," she said, looking up from the slip of paper. "might i ask where
this verse came from? and why you are seeking an orb?"

"you might ask,"

the creaking of a heavy door behind them made them turn, just as the door closed with a
resounding thud and the latch fell into place.

the lone man who had been standing behind the door looked calm as he aimed a small revolver at
them. he was portly and was propped on a pair of aluminum crutches.

for a moment langdon thought he must be dreaming.

it was leigh teabing.



chapter 99

sir leigh teabing felt rueful as he gazed out over the barrel of his medusa revolver at robert
langdon and sophie neveu. "my friends," he said, "since the moment you walked into my home
last night, i have done everything in my power to keep you out of harm's way. but your persistence
has now put me in a difficult position."

he could see the expressions of shock and betrayal on sophie's and langdon's faces, and yet he
was confident that soon they would both understand the chain of events that had guided the three of
them to this unlikely crossroads.

there is so much i have to tell you both... so much you do not

man also mentioned your
granddaughter, sophie."

the mention of sophie's name had been the catalyst. the curator leapt into action. he ordered silas
to come see him immediately in the safest location sauniere knew — his louvre office. then he
phoned sophie to warn her she might be in danger. drinks with robert langdon were instantly
abandoned.

now, with langdon separated from sophie on the far side of the room, teabing sensed he had
successfully alienated the two companions from one another. sophie neveu remained defiant, but
langdon clearly saw the larger picture. he was trying to figure out the password. he understands
the importance of finding the grail and releasing her from bondage.

"he won't open it for you," sophie said coldly. "even if he can."

teabing was glancing at langdon as he held the gun on sophie. he was fairly certain now he was
going to have to use the weapon. although the idea troubled him, he knew he would not hesitate if
it came to that. / have given her every opportunity

fache's dark eyes studied him a long moment. "a virtuous gesture, my lord. i will see to it your
wishes are carried out. "

a heavy silence fell between them.

on the television, a lean french police officer was giving a press conference in front of a sprawling
mansion. fache saw who it was and turned his attention to the screen.

"lieutenant collet," a bbc reporter said, her voice accusing. "last night, your captain publicly
charged two innocent people with murder. will robert langdon and sophie neveu be seeking
accountability from your department? will this cost captain fache his job?"

lieutenant collet's smile was tired but calm. "it is my experience that captain bezu fache seldom
makes mistakes. i have not yet spoken to him on this matter, but knowing how he operates, i
suspect his public manhunt for agent neveu and mr. langdon was part of a ruse to lure out the
real killer. "

the reporters exchanged surprised looks.

collet continued. "whether or not mr. langdon and agent neveu were wi

the chapel's geographic coordinates fall precisely on the north-south meridian that runs through
glastonbury. this longitudinal rose line is the traditional marker of king arthur's isle of avalon
and is considered the central pillar of britain's sacred geometry. it is from this hallowed rose line
that rosslyn — originally spelled roslin — takes its name.

rosslyn's rugged spires were casting long evening shadows as robert langdon and sophie neveu
pulled their rental car into the grassy parking area at the foot of the bluff on which the chapel stood.
their short flight from london to edinburgh had been restful, although neither of them had slept
for the anticipation of what lay ahead. gazing up at the stark edifice framed against a cloud-swept
sky, langdon felt like alice falling headlong into the rabbit hole. this must be a dream. and yet he
knew the text of sauniere's final message could not have been more specific.
