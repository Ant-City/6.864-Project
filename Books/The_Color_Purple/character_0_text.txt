dear god,


one night while shug singing a hot one, who should come prancing through the door of harpo's but sofia.

she with a big tall hefty man look like a prize fighter.

she her usual stout and bouncy self.

oh, miss celie, she cry. it so good to see you again. it even good to see mr. , she say. she take one of his hands. even

if his handshake is a little weak, she say.

he act real glad to see her.

i can't git over how good sofia look.

most women with five children look a little peaked, i say to her cross the table when shug finish her song. you look like
you ready for five more.

oh, she say, i got six children now. miss celie.

she toss her head, look over at harpo. life don't stop just cause you leave home. miss celie. you know that.

my life stop when i left home, i think. but then i think again. it stop with mr. maybe, but start up again with shug.

shug come over and she and sofia hug.

shug say. girl, you look like a good time, you do.

this the first giggle i heard in three years.


dear god,


sofia would make a dog laugh, talking about those people she work for. they have the nerve to try to make us think
slavery fell through because of us, say sofia. like us didn't have sense enough to handle it. all the time breaking hoe

i hear shug cry. oh, albert. he say, shug. i know they hugging. then i don't hear nothing.

i run out the door. shug, i say, and put out my arms. but before i know anything a skinny big toof man wearing red

the minute she say it i know i don't like grady. i don't like his shape, i don't like his teef, i don't like his clothes. seem like
to me he smell.

i lay there quiet, listening to shug breathe.

shug so quiet i think she sleep.

after he through, i say, he make me finish trimming his hair.

i sneak a look at shug.

oh, miss celie, she say. and put her arms round me. they black and smooth and kind of glowy from the lamplight.

i start to cry too. i cry and cry and cry. seem like it all come back to me, laying there in shug arms. how it hurt and how
much i was surprise. how it stung while i finish trimming his hair. how the blood drip down my leg and mess up my

i don't know nothing bout it, i say to shug.

me again and since i never heard from you all this time, i guess he was right. now i only write at christmas and easter
hoping my letter get lost among the christmas and easter greetings, or that albert get the holiday spirit and have pity on

when i left you all's house, walking, he followed me on his horse. when we was well out of sight of the house he caught
up with me and started trying to talk. you know how he do. you sure is looking fine. miss nettie, and stuff like that. i tried
to ignore him and walk faster, but my bundles was heavy and the sun was hot. after while i had to rest, and that's when

dear celie,


i wrote a letter to you almost every day on the ship coming to africa. but by the time we docked i was so down, i tore
them into little pieces and dropped them into the water. albert is not going to let you have my letters and so what use is
there in writing them. that's the way i felt when i tore them up and sent them to you on the waves. but now i feel
different.

i remember one time you said your life made you feel so ashamed you couldn't even talk about it to god, you had to
write it, ba

d as you thought your writing was. well, now i know what you meant. and whether god will read letters or no,
i know you will go on writing them; which is guidance enough for me. anyway, when i don't write to you i feel as bad as i
do when i don't pray, locked up in myself and choking on my own heart. i am so lonely, celie.

the reason i am in africa is because one of the missionaries that was supposed to go with corrine and samuel to help
with the children and with setting up a school suddenly married a man who was afraid to let her go, and refused to come
to africa with her. so there they were, all set to go, with a ticket suddenly available and no missionary to give it to. at the
same time, i wasn't able to find a job anywhere around town. but i never dreamed of going to africa! i never even
thought about it a

fe was shoppingâ€” going in

seen the mayor's wife. she looks like a wet cat. and there was her maid looking like the very last person in the world
you'd expect to see waiting on anybody, and in particular not on anybody that looked like that.

i spoke. but just speaking to me seemed to make her embarrassed and she suddenly sort of erased herself. it was the
strangest thing, celie! one minute i was saying howdy to a living woman. the next minute nothing living was there. only
its shape.

all that night i thought about it. then samuel and corrine told me what they'd heard about how she got to be the mayor's
maid. that she attacked the mayor, and then the mayor and his wife took her from the prison to work in their home.

in the morning i started asking questions about africa and started reading all the books samuel and corrine have on the
subject.

did you know there were

the egyptians who built the pyramids and enslaved the israelites were colored? that egypt is in africa? that the ethiopia

well, i read and i read until i thought my eyes would fall out. i read where the africans sold us because they loved money
more than their own sisters and brothers. how we came to america in ships. how we were made to work.

i hadn't realized i was so ignorant, celie. the little i knew about my own self wouldn't have filled a thimble! and to think
miss beasley always said i was the smartest child she ever taught! but one thing i do thank her for, for teaching me to
learn for myself, by reading and studying and writing a clear hand. and for keeping alive in me somehow the desire to
know. so when corrine and samuel asked me if i would come with them and help them build a school in the middle of
africa, i said yes. but only if they would teach me everything th

in the beginning was that they could not have children. and then, they say, "god" sent them olivia and adam.

the bible were colored. it had never occurred to me, though when you read the bible it is
perfectly plain if you pay attention only to the words. it is the pictures in the bible that fool you. the pictures that
illustrate the words. all of the people are white and so you just think all the people from the bible were white too. but
really white white people lived somewhere else during those times. that's why the bible says that jesus christ had hair
like lamb's wool. lamb's wool is not straight, celie. it isn't even curly.

there is a fashion in harlem now for boys to wear something called knickersâ€” sort of baggy pants, fitted tight just below

africans will be working for a common goal: the uplift of black people everywhere.

dear celie,


samuel is a big man. he dresses in black almost all the time, except for his white clerical collar. and he is black. until you
see his eyes you think he's somber, even mean, but he has the most thoughtful and gentle brown eyes. when he says
something it settles you, because he never says anything off the top of his head and he's never out to dampen your spirit
or to hurt. corrine is a lucky woman to have him as her husband.

times" is a phrase the english love to use, when speaking of africa. and it is easy to forget that africa's "hard times" were
made harder by them. millions and millions of africans were captured and sold into slaveryâ€” you and me, celie! and
whole cities were destroyed by slave catching wars. today the people of africa â€” having murdered or sold into slavery
their strongest folksâ€” are riddled by disease and sunk in spiritual and physical confusion. they believe in the devil and
worship the dead. nor can they read or write.

the way we stopped in lisbon, portugal and dakar, senegal.

monrovia was the last place we were among people we were somewhat used to, since it is an african country that was
"founded" by ex-slaves from america who came back to africa to live. had any of their parents or grandparents been sold
from monrovia, i wondered, and what was their feeling, once sold as slaves, now coming back, with close ties to the
country that bought them, to rule.

celie, i must stop now. the sun is not so hot now and i must prepare for the afternoon classes and vesper service.

i wish you were with me, or i with you.

my love.
your sister, nettie


dearest celie,


it was the funniest thing to stop over in monrovia after my first glimpse of africa, which was senegal. the capital of
senegal is dakar and the people speak their own language, senegalese i guess they would call it, and french. they are the
blackest people i have ever seen, celie. they are black lik

e the people we are talking about when we say, "so and so is
blacker than black, he's blue black." they are so black, celie, they shine. which is something else folks down home like to
say about real black folks. but celie, try to imagine a city full of these shining, blueblack people wearing brilliant blue
robes with designs like fancy quilt patterns. tall, thin, with long necks and straight backs. can you picture it at all, celie?
because i felt like i was seeing black for the first time. and celie, there is something magical about it. because the black is
so black the eye is simply dazzled, and then there is the shining that seems to come, really, from moonlight, it is so
luminous, but their skin glows even in the sun.

but i did not really like the senegalese i met in the market. they were concerned only with their sale of produce. if we did
not buy, they looked through us as quickly as they looked through the white french people who live there. somehow i
had not expected to see any whi

and whole villages built right in the middle of the fields. we watched the weary families come home from work, still
carrying their cacoa seed buckets in their hands (these double as lunch buckets next day), and sometimesâ€” if they are
womenâ€” their children on their backs. as tired as they are, they sing! celie. just like we do at home. why do tired people
sing? i asked corrine. too tired to do anything else, she said. besides, they don't own the cacoa fields, celie, even
president tubman doesn't own them. people in a place called holland do. the people who make dutch chocolate. and
there are overseers who make sure the people work hard, who live in stone houses in the corners of the fields.

vibrated. corrine and samuel felt the same. and we kneeled down right on deck and gave thanks to god for letting us see
the land for which our mothers and fathers criedâ€” and lived and diedâ€” to see again.

oh, celie! will i ever be able to tell you all?

i dare not ask, i know. but leave it all to god.

now i know nettie alive i begin to strut a little bit.

think, when she come home us leave here. her and me and our two children. what they look like, i wonder. but it hard
to think bout them. i feels shame. more than love, to tell the truth. anyway, is they all right here? got good sense and all?
shug say children got by incest turn into dunces. incest part of the devil's plan.

but i think bout nettie.

it's hot, here, celie, she write. hotter than july. hotter than august and july. hot like cooking dinner on a big stove in a
little kitchen in august and july. hot.


dear celie,

we were met at the ship by an african from the village we are settling in. his christian name is joseph. he is short and fat,
with hands that seem not to have any bones in them. when he shook my hand it felt like something soft and damp was
falling and i almost caught it. he speaks a little english, what they call pidgin english. it is ver
 
 ___________________________
 
d browbeat poor samuel out of a
tip that joseph said was too big, they were off hallooing another group of people who were waiting at the edge of the
water to be taken to the ship.

the port is pretty, but too shallow for large ships to use. so there is a good business for the boatmen, during the season
the ships come by. these boatmen were all considerably larger and more muscular than joseph, though all of them,
including joseph, are a deep chocolate brown. not black, like the senegalese. and celie, they all have the strongest,
cleanest, whitest teeth! i was thinking about teeth a lot on the voyage over, because i had toothache nearly the entire
time. you know how rotten my back teeth are. and in england i was struck by the english people's teeth. so crooked,
usually, and blackish with decay. i wondered if it was the english water. but the africans' teeth remind me of horses'
teeth, they are so fully formed, straight and strong.

the port's "town" is the size of the hardware store in town

 the children at the end of this tale, i saw coming slowly towards us, a large brown spiky thing as
big as a room, with a dozen legs walking slowly and carefully under it. when it reached our canopy, it was presented to
us. it was our roof.

as it approached, the people bowed down.

the white missionary before you would not let us have this ceremony, said joseph. but the olinka like it very much. we
know a roofleaf is not jesus christ, but in its own humble way, is it not god?

so there we sat, celie, face to face with the olinka god. and celie, i was so tired and sleepy and full of chicken and
groundnut stew, my ears ringing with song, that all that joseph said made perfect sense to me.

i wonder what you will make of all this?


send my love.


your sister, nettie



dear celie,

we are up at five o'clock for a light breakfast of millet porridge and fruit, and the morning classes. we teach the children
english, reading, writing, history, geography, arithmetic and the stories of the bible. at eleven o'clock we break for lunch
and household duties. from one until four it is too hot to move, though some of the mothers sit behind their huts and

t i work harder here than i ever dreamed i could work, and that i sweep out the school and tidy up after
service, but i don't feel like a drudge. i was surprised that this woman, whose christian name is catherine, saw me in this
light.

she has a little girl, tashi, who plays with olivia after school. adam is the only boy who will speak to olivia at school. they
are not mean to her, it is justâ€” what is it? because she is where they are doing "boys' things" they do not see her. but
never fear, celie, olivia has your stubbornness and clearsightedness, and she is smarter than all of them, including adam,
put together.

why can't tashi come to school? she asked me. when i told her the olinka don't believe in educating girls she said, quick
as a flash. they're like white people at home who don't want colored people to learn.

oh, she's sharp, celie. at the end of the day, when tashi can get away from all the chores her mother assigns her, she and
olivia secret themselves in my hut and everythi

this bothered me a little, but i didn't say anything. the children do call me mama nettie sometimes because i do a good
bit of fussing over them. but i never try to take corrine's place.


and another thing, she said. i think we ought to try not to borrow each other's clothes.

well, she never borrowed anything of mine because i don't have much. but i'm all the time borrowing something of hers.
you feeling yourself? i asked her.

she said yes.

i wish you could see my hut, celie. i love it. unlike our school, which is square, and unlike our church, which doesn't have
wallsâ€” at least during the dry seasonâ€” my hut is round, walled, with a round roofleaf roof. it is twenty steps across the
middle and fits me to a t. over the mud walls i have hung olinka platters and mats and pieces of tribal cloth. the olinka
are known for their beautiful cotton fabric which they handweave and dye with berries, clay, indigo and tree bark. then
there is my paraffin camp stove in the ce

wonderful rush mats on the floor. it is all colorful and warm and homey. my only desire for it now is a window! none of
the village huts have windows, and when i spoke of a window to the women they laughed heartily. the rainy season
makes the thought of a window ridiculous, apparently. but i am determined to have one, even if a flood collects daily on
my floor.

i would give anything for a picture of you, celie. in my trunk i have pictures donated to us by the missionary societies in
england and america. pictures of christ, the apostles, mary, the crucifixion. speke, livingstone, stanley, schweitzer.
maybe one day i'll put them up, but once, when i held them up to my fabric and mat covered walls they made me feel
very small and unhappy, so i took them down. even the picture of christ which generally looks good anywhere looks
peculiar here. we of course have all of these pictures hung in the school and

dear celie,


tashi's mother and father were just here. they are upset because she spends so much time with olivia. she is changing,
becoming quiet and too thoughtful, they say. she is becoming someone else; her face is beginning to show the spirit of
one of her aunts who was sold to the trader because she no longer fit into village life. this aunt refused to marry the man
chosen for her. refused to bow to the chief. did nothing but lay up, crack cola nuts between her teeth and giggle.

they want to know

next time tashi appears at your gate, you will send her straight home, her father said. then he smiled. your olivia can
visit her, and learn what women are for.

i smiled also. olivia must learn to take her education about life where she can find it, i thought. his offer will make a
splendid opportunity.

good-bye until the next time, dear celie, from a pitiful, castout woman who may perish during the rainy season.

your loving sister, nettie


dear celie,


at first there was the faintest sound of movement in the forest. a kind of low humming. then there was chopping and the
sound of dragging. then a scent, some days, of smoke. but now, after two months, during which i or the children or
corrine has been sick, all we hear is chopping and scraping and dragging. and every day we smell smoke.

s of witchcraft or infidelity,
she can be killed.

thank god (and sometimes samuel's intervention) this has not happened since we've been here. but the stories tashi
tells are often about such gruesome events that happened in the recent past. and god forbid that the child of a favorite
wife should fall ill! that is the point at which even the women's friendships break down, as each woman fears the
accusation of sorcery from the other, or from the husband.

merry christmas to you and yours, dear celie. we celebrate it here on the "dark" continent with prayer and song and a
large picnic complete with watermelon, fresh fruit punch, and barbecue!

god bless you,

dearest celie,


i meant to write you in time for easter, but it was not a good time for me and i did not want to burden you with any
distressing news. so a whole year has gone by. the first thing i should tell you about is the road. the road finally reached
the cassava fields about nine months ago and the olinka, who love noth

r as the olinka were concerned (after all, it had reached their village),
what should we discover but that the roadbuilders were back at work. they have instructions to continue the road for
another thirty miles! and to continue it on its present course right through the village of olinka. by the time we were out
of bed, the road was already being dug through catherine's newly planted yam field. of course the olinka were up in
arms. but the roadbuilders were literally up in arms. they had guns, celie, with orders to shoot!

it was pitiful, celie. the people felt so betrayed! they stood by helplesslyâ€” they really don't know how to fight, and rarely
think of it since the old days of tribal warsâ€” as their crops and then their very homes were destroyed. yes. the
roadbuilders didn't deviate an inch from the plan the headman was following. every hut that lay in the proposed
roadpath was leveled. and, celie, our church, our school, my hut, all went down in a matter of hours. fortunately, we

corrine has been very ill with african fever. many missionaries in the past have died from it.

but the children are fine. the boys now accept olivia and tashi in class and more mothers are sending their daughters to
school. the men do not like it: who wants a wife who knows everything her husband knows? they fume. but the women
have their ways, and they love their children, even their girls.

i will write more when things start looking up. i trust god they will.


your sister, nettie


dearest celie,


this whole year, after easter, has been difficult. since corrine's illness, all her work has fallen on me, and i must nurse her
as well, which she resents.

one day when i was changing her as she lay in bed, she gave me a long, mean, but somehow pitiful look. why do my
children look like you? she asked.

do you really think they look so much like me? i said.

you could have spit them out, she said.

maybe just living together, loving people makes them look like you, i said. you know how much

 some old married people
look alike.

even these women saw the resemblance the first day we came, she said.

and that's worried you all this time? i tried to laugh it off
but she just looked at me.

when did you first meet my husband? she wanted to know.

and that was when i knew what she thought. she thinks adam and olivia are my children, and that samuel is their father!
oh, celie, this thing has been gnawing away at her all these years!

i met samuel the same day i met you, corrine, i said. (i still haven't got the hang of saying "sister" all the time.) as god is
my witness, that's the truth.

bring the bible, she said.

i brought the bible, and placed my hand on it, and swore.

you've never known me to lie, corrine, i said. please believe i am not lying now.

then she called samuel, and made him swear that the day she met me was the day he met me also.

he said: i apol

ogize for this. sister nettie, please forgive us.

as soon as samuel left the room she made me raise my dress and she sat up in her sickbed to examine my stomach.

i felt so sorry for her, and so humiliated, celie. and the way she treats the children is the hardest part. she doesn't want
them near her, which they don't understand. how could they? they don't even know they were adopted.

the village is due to be planted in rubber trees this coming season. the olinka hunting territory has already been
destroyed, and the men must go farther and farther away to find game. the women spend all their time in the fields,
tending their crops and praying. they sing to the earth and to the sky and to their cassava

we are all sad, here, celie. i hope life is happier for you.


your sister, nettie


dear celie,


guess what? samuel thought the children were mine too! that is why he urged me to come to africa with them. when i
showed up at their house he thought i was following my children, and, soft-hearted as he is, didn't have the heart to turn
me away.

if they are not yours, he said, whose are they?

but i had some questions for him, first.

where did you get them? i asked. and celie, he told me a story that made my hair stand on end. i hope you, poor thing,
are ready for it.

my family back home very large and poor, and it was time for me to get out and earn my own living.

dear celie,


i woke up this morning bound to tell corrine and samuel everything. i went over to their hut and pulled up a stool next to
corrine's bed. she's so weak by now that all she can do is look unfriendlyâ€” and i could tell i wasn't welcome.

i said, corrine, i'm here to tell you and samuel the truth.

she said, samuel already told me. if the children yours, why didn't you just say so?

samuel said. now, honey.

she said. don't now honey me. nettie swore on the bible to tell me the truth. to tell

f turned my back more on samuel and whispered: you saw my stomach, i said.

what do i know about pregnancy, she said. i never experienced it myself. for all i know, women may be able to rub out all
the signs.

they can't rub out stretch marks, i said. stretch marks go right into the skin, and a woman's stomach stretches enough so
that it keeps a little pot, like all the women have here.

she turned her face to the wall.

corrine, i said, i'm the children's aunt. their mother is my older sister, celie.

then i told them the whole story. only corrine was still not convinced.

you and samuel telling so many lies, who can believe anything you say? she asked.

you've got to believe nettie, said samuel. though the part about you and pa was a real shock to him.

then i remembered what you told me about seeing corrine and samuel and olivia in town, when she was buying cloth to
make her and olivia dresses, and how you sent me to her because she was the only woman you'd ever seen with money. i
tried 
 
 ___________________________
 
to make corrine remember that day, but she couldn't.

she gets weaker and weaker, and unless she can believe us and start to feel something for her children, i fear we will lose
her.

oh, celie, unbelief is a terrible thing. and so is the hurt we cause others unknowingly.

pray for us,
nettie


dearest celie,


every day for the past week i've been trying to get corrine to remember meeting you in town. i know if she can just recall
your face, she will believe olivia (if not adam) is your child. they think olivia looks like me, but that is only because i look
like you. olivia has your face and eyes, exactly. it amazes me that corrine didn't see the resemblance.

remember the main street of town? i asked. remember the hitching post in front of finley's dry goods store? remember
how the store smelled 
 
 ___________________________
 
slowly her eyes filled with tears.

she was so much like olivia! she said. i was afraid she'd want her back. so i forgot her as soon as i could. all i let myself
think about was how the clerk treated me! i was acting like somebody because i was samuel's wife, and a spelman
seminary graduate, and he treated me like any ordinary nigger. oh, my feelings were hurt! and i was mad! and that's
what i thought about, even told samuel about, on the way home. not about your sisterâ€” what was her name?â€” celie?
nothing about her.

she began to cry in earnest. me and samuel holding her hands.

don't cry. don't cry, i said. my sister was glad to see olivia with you. glad to see her alive. she thought both her children
were dead.

poor thing! said samuel. and we sat there talking a little and holding on to each other until corrine fell off to sleep.

but, celie, in the middle of the night she woke up, turned to samuel and said: i believe. and died anyway.

your sister in sorrow, nettie


dearest celie,

and how are you? dear sister. the years have come and gone without a single word from you. only the sky above us do
we hold in common. i look at it often as if, somehow, reflected from its immensities, i will one day find myself gazing into
your eyes. your dear, large, clean and beautiful eyes. oh, celie! my life here is nothing but work, work, work, and worry.
what girlhood i might have had passed me by. and i have nothing of my own. no man, no children, no close friend,

god likes.

like what? i ast.

well, this sound like blasphemy sure nuff.

she say, celie, tell the truth, have you ever found god in church? i never did. i just found a bunch of folks hoping for him

how come? i ast.

cause that's the one that's in the white folks' white bible.

shug! i say. god wrote the bible, white folks had nothing to do with it.

how come he look just like them, then? she say. only bigger? and a heap more hair. how come the bible just like
everything else they make, all about them doing one thing and another, and all the colored folks doing is gitting cursed?

a dust devil flew up on the porch between us, fill my mouth with dirt. the dirt say. anything you do to me, already done
to you.

then i feel shug shake me. celie, she say. and i come to myself.

i'm pore, i'm black, i may be ugly and can't cook, a voice say to everything listening. but i'm here.

good is, they totally comfortable. cause shug eat a lot of junk on the road, and
drink, her stomach bloat. so the pants can be let out without messing up the shape. because she have to pack her stuff
and fight wrinkles, these pants are soft, hardly wrinkle at all, and the little figures in the cloth always look perky and
bright. and they full round the ankle so if she want to sing in 'em and wear 'em sort of like a long dress, she can. plus,
once shug put them on, she knock your eyes out.

miss celie, she say. you is a wonder to behold.

i duck my head. she run round the house looking at herself in mirrors. no matter how she look, she look good.

you know how it is when you don't have nothing to do, i say, when she brag to grady and squeak bout her pants. i sit
here thinking bout how to make a living and before i know it i'm off on another pair pants.

by now squeak see a pair she like. oh, miss celie, she say. can i try on those?

she put on a pair the color of sunset. orangish with a litt

she laugh. let's us put a few advertisements in the paper, she say. and let's us raise your prices a hefty notch. and let's us
just go ahead and give you this diningroom for your factory and git you some more women in here to cut and sew, while
you sit back and design. you making your living, celie, she say. girl, you on your way.

nettie, i am making some pants for you to beat the heat in africa. soft, white, thin. drawstring waist. you won't ever have

shug say. she can talk in sign language for all i care. she make herself a nice cup of herb tea and start talking bout hot

but i let darlene worry on. sometimes i think bout the apples and the dogs, sometimes i don't. look like to me only a fool

dearest celie,


by now i expected to be home. looking into your face and saying celie, is it really you? i try to picture what the years have
brought you in the way of weight and wrinklesâ€” or how you fix your hair. from a skinny, hard little something i've
become quite plump. and some of my hair is gray!

but samuel tells me he loves me plump and graying.

does this surprise you?

we were married last fall in england where we tried to get relief for the olinka from the churches and the missionary
society.
 
 ___________________________
 
one for men and one for women and children. but, because the olinka swore they would never live in a
dwelling not covered by their god, roofleaf, the builders left these barracks uncovered. then they proceeded to plow
under the olinka village and everything else for miles around. including every last stalk of roofleaf.

after nearly unbearable weeks in the hot sun, we were awakened one morning by the sound of a large truck pulling into
the compound. it was loaded with sheets of corrugated tin.

celie, we had to pay for the tin. which exhausted what meager savings the olinka had, and nearly wiped out the money
samuel and i had managed to put by for the education of the children once we return home. which we have planned to
do each year since corrine died, only to find ourselves more and more involved in the olinka's problems. nothing could
be uglier than corrugated tin, celie. and as they struggled to put up roofs of this cold, hard, glittery, ugly metal the
women raised a deafening ululatio
 
 ___________________________
 
acknowledged at least temporary defeat.

though the olinka no longer ask anything of us, beyond teaching their childrenâ€” because they can see how powerless we
and our god areâ€” samuel and i decided we must do something about this latest outrage, even as many of the people to
whom we felt close ran away to join the mbeles or forest people, who live deep in the jungle, refusing to work for whites
or be ruled by them.

so off we went, with the children, to england.

it was an incredible voyage, celie, not only because we had almost forgot about the rest of the world, and such things as
ships and coal fires and streetlights and oatmeal, but because on the ship with us was the white woman missionary whom
we'd heard about years ago. she was now retired from missionary work and going back to england to live. she was
traveling with a little african boy whom she introduced as her grandchild!

of course it was impossible to ignore the presence of an aging white woman accompanied by a small black c

 even recognize us as the brothers
and sisters they sold.

oh, samuel, i said. don't.

but you know, he had started to cry. oh nettie, he said. that's the heart of it, don't you see. we love them. we try every
way we can to show that love. but they reject us. they never even listen to how we've suffered. and if they listen they say
stupid things. why don't you speak our language? they ask. why can't you remember the old ways? why aren't you
happy in america, if everyone there drives motorcars?

celie, it seemed as good a time as any to put my arms around him. which i did. and words long buried in my heart crept
to my lips. i stroked his dear head and face and i called him darling and dear. and i'm afraid, dear, dear celie, that concern
and passion soon ran away with us.

i hope when you receive this news of your sister's forward behavior you will not be shocked or inclined to judge me
harshly. especially when i tell you what a total joy it was. i was transported by ecstasy in samuel's arms.
 
 ___________________________
 


you may have guessed that i loved him all along; but i did not know it. oh, i loved him as a brother and respected him as a
friend, but celie, i love him bodily, as a man\ i love his walk, his size, his shape, his smell, the kinkiness of his hair. i love
the very texture of his palms. the pink of his inner lip. i love his big nose. i love his brows. i love his feet. and i love his
dear eyes in which the vulnerability and beauty of his soul can be plainly read.

the children saw the change in us immediately. i'm afraid, my dear, we were radiant.

we love each other dearly, samuel told them, with his arm around me. we intend to marry.

 
 ___________________________
 

but before we do, i said, i must tell you something about my life and about corrine and about someone else. and it was
then i told them about you, celie. and about their mother corrine's love of them. and about being their aunt.

but where is this other woman, your sister? asked olivia.

i explained your marriage to mr. as best i could.

adam was instantly alarmed. he is a very sensitive soul who hears what isn't said as clearly as what is.

we will go back to america soon, said samuel to reassure him, and see about her.

the children stood up with us in a simple church ceremony in london. and it was that night, after the wedding dinner,
when w

to tie roofleaf twigs in her hair. he was mad enough to strike her.

well, it's a good thing he didn't, i said. tashi would have jammed his head through her rug loom.

i'll be glad when we get back home, said olivia. adam isn't the only one who misses tashi.

she kissed me and her father good night. adam soon came in to do the same.

mama nettie, he said, sitting on the bed next to me, how do you know when you really love someone?

sometimes you don't know, i said.

he is a beautiful young man, celie. tall and broad-shouldered, with a deep, thoughtful voice. did i tell you he writes
verses? and loves to sing? he's a son to make you proud.

your loving sister, nettie


p.s. your brother samuel sends his love as well.


dearest celie,


when we returned home everyone seemed happy to see us. when we told them our appeal to the church and the
missionary society failed, they were disappointed. they literally wiped the smiles off their faces along with the sweat, and
returned, dejected, to their

e provide antiseptics
and cotton and a place for the children to cry and nurse their wounds.

each day adam presses us to leave for home. he can no longer bear living as we do. there aren't even any trees near us,
just giant boulders and smaller rocks. and more and more of his companions are running away. the real reason, of
course, is he can no longer bear his conflicting feelings about tashi, who is beginning, i think, to appreciate the magnitude
of her mistake.

samuel and i are truly happy, celie. and so grateful to god that we are! we still keep a school for the littlest children;
those eight and over are already workers in the fields. in order to pay rent for the barracks, taxes on the land, and to buy
water and wood and food, everyone must work. so, we teach the young ones, babysit the babies, look after the old and
sick, and attend birthing mothers. our days are fuller than ever, our sojourn in england already a dream. but all things
look brighter because i have a loving soul to sha

dearest nettie,


the man us knowed as pa is dead.

how come you still call him pa? shug ast me the other day.

but, too late to call him alphonso. i never even remember ma calling him by his name. she always said. your pa. i reckon
to make us believe it better. anyhow, his little wife, daisy, call me up on the telephone in the middle of the night.

miss celie, she say, i got bad news. alphonso dead.

who? i ast.

alphonso, she say. your stepdaddy.

how he die? i ast. i think of killing, being hit by a truck, struck by lightening, lingering disease. but she say, naw, he died in
his sleep. well, not quite in his sleep, she say. us was spending a little time in bed together, you know, before us drop off.
well, i say, you have my sympathy.

yes ma'am, she say, and i thought i had this house too, but look like it belong to your sister nettie and you.

nd father. kind to the poor and helpless. he been dead two weeks but fresh
flowers still blooming on his grave.

shug git out the car and come stand by me.

finally she yawn loud and stretch herself. the son of a bitch still dead, she say.

daisy try to act like she glad to see us, but she not. she got two children and look pregnant with one more. but she got
nice clothes, a car, and alphonso left her all his money. plus, i think she manage to set her folks up while she live with
him.

she say, celie, the old house you remember was torn down so alphonso could build this one. he got an atlanta architect
to design it, and these tiles come all the way from new york. we was standing in the kitchen at the time. but he put tiles
everywhere. kitchen, toilet, back porch. all around the fireplaces in back and front parlour. but this the house go with the
place, right on, she say. of course i did take the furniture, because alphonso bought it special for me.

fine with me, i say. i can't get over hav

like i'm crazy. look at this, i say to shug. look at that! she look, she grin. she hug me whenever she git the chance and i
stand still.

you doin' all right. miss celie, she say. god know where you live.

then she took some cedar sticks out of her bag and lit them and gave one of them to me. us started at the very top of the
house in the attic, and us smoked it all the way down to the basement, chasing out all the evil and making a place for
good.

oh, nettie, us have a house! a house big enough for us and our children, for your husband and shug. now you can come
home cause you have a home to come to!


your loving sister, celie

shug love somebody else.

maybe if i had stayed in memphis last summer it never would have happen. but i spent the summer fixing up the house. i
thought if you come anytime soon, i want it to be ready. and it is real pretty, now, and comfortable. and i found me a
nice lady to live in it and look after it. then i come home to shug.

miss celie, she say, how would you like some chinese food to celebrate your coming home?

i loves chinese food. so off us go to the restaurant. i'm so excited about being home again i don't even notice how
nervous shug is. she a big graceful woman most of the time, even when she mad. but i notice she can't git her chopsticks
to work right. she knock over her glass of water. somehow or nother her eggroll come unravel.

but i think she just so glad to see me. so i preen and pose for her and stuff myself wit

y. like all his good points have to be stuff i'm dying to hear.

oh, she say. he little. he cute. got nice buns. you know, real bantu. she so used to telling me everything she rattle on and
on, gitting more excited and in-love looking by the minute. by the time she finish talking about his neat little dancing feet
and git back up to his honey brown curly hair, i feel like shit.

hold it, i say. shug, you killing me.

she halt in mid-praise. her eyes fill with tears and her face crumple. oh god, celie, she say. i'm sorry. i just been dying to
tell somebody, and you the somebody i usually tell.

well, i say, if words could kill, i'd be in the ambulance.

she put her face in her hands and start to cry. celie, she say, through her fingers, i still love you.

but i just sit there and watch her. seem like all my wonton soup turn to ice.

why you so upset? she ast, when us got back home. you never seem to git upset bout grady. and he was my husband.
grady never bring no sparkle to your eye, i thin

eally, she say, what they gon look
like in panama?

poor mary agnes, i think. how could anybody guess old dull grady would end up running a reefer plantation in panama?
course they making boocoos of money, say shug. and mary agnes outdress everybody down there, the way she tell it in
her letters. and at least grady let her sing. what little snatches of her songs she can still remember. but really, she say,
panama? where is it at, anyhow? is it down there round cuba? us ought to go to cuba, miss celie, you know? lots of
gambling there and good times. a lots of colored folks look like mary agnes. some real black, like us. all in the same
family though. try to pass for white, somebody mention your grandma.

i don't say nothing. i pray to die, just so i don't never have to speak.

all right, say shug. it started when you was down home. i missed you, celie. and you know i'm a high natured woman.


i went and got a piece of paper that i was using for cutting patterns. i wrote her a note. it said.
 
 ___________________________
 
 shut up.

but celie, she say. i have to make you understand. look, she say. i'm gitting old. i'm fat. nobody think i'm good looking no
more, but you. or so i thought. he's nineteen. a baby. how long can it last?

he's a man. i write on the paper.

yeah, she say. he is. and i know how you feel about men. but i don't feel that way. i would never be fool enough to take
any of them seriously, she say, but some mens can be a lots of fun.

spare me, i write.

celie, she say. all i ast is six months. just six months to have my last fling. i got to have it celie. i'm too weak a woman not
to. but if you just give me six months, celie, i will try to make our life together like it was.

not hardly. i write.

celie, she say. do you love me? she down on her knees by now, tears falling all over the place. my heart hurt so much i
can't believe it. how can it keep beating, feeling like this? but i'm a woman. i love you, i say. whatever happen, whatever
you do, i lo

she whimper a little, lean her head against my chair. thank you, she say.

but i can't stay here, i say.

but celie, she say, how can you leave me? you're my friend. i love this child and i'm scared to death. he's a third of my
age. a third of my size. even a third of my color. she try to laugh again. you know he gon hurt me worse than i'm hurting
you. don't leave me, please.

just then the door bell ring. shug wiped her face and went to answer it, saw who it was and kept on out the door. soon i
heard a car drive off. i went on up to bed. but sleep remain a stranger to this night.

pray for me.

she scream enough to wake the dead. us do what you say the peoples do in africa. us feed her yams every single day.
just our luck she hate yams and she not too polite to let us know. everybody for miles around try to come up with yam

how you make your living up there? he say.

he say, i notice everybody in the family just about wearing pants you made. but you mean you turned it into a business?
that's right, i say. but i really started it right here in your house to keep from killing you.

he look down at the floor.

shug help me make the first pair i ever did, i say. and then, like a fool, i start to cry.

he say, celie, tell me the truth. you don't like me cause i'm a man?

i blow my nose. take off they pants, i say, and men look like frogs to me. no matter how you kiss 'em, as far as i'm
concern, frogs is what they stay.

i see, he say.

by the time i got back home i was feeling so bad i couldn't do nothing but sleep. i tried to work on some new pants i'm

tashi and her mother have run away. they have gone to join the mbeles. samuel and the children and i were discussing it
just yesterday, and we realized we do not even know for sure the mbeles exist. all we know is that they are said to live
deep in the forest, that they welcome runaways, and that they harass the white man's plantations and plan his
destructionâ€” or at least for his removal from their continent.

adam and olivia are heartbroken because they love tashi and mis

't pursue with the children, only with

my beloved companion, samuel, who advises me not to worry, to trust in god, and to have faith in the sturdiness of my
sister's soul.

god is different to us now, after all these years in africa. more spirit than ever before, and more internal. most people
think he has to look like something or someoneâ€” a roofleaf or christâ€” but we don't. and not being tied to what god looks
like, frees us.

when we return to america we must have long talks about this, celie. and perhaps samuel and i will found a new church
in our community that has no idols in it whatsoever, in which each person's spirit is encouraged to seek god directly, his
belief that this is possible strengthened by us as people who also believe. there is little to do here for entertainment, as
you can imagine. we read the papers and magazines from home, play any number of african games with the children.

d as hamlet giving his to be or

such a shock, except for the hatred of black people, which is also very clear in all the news. but i worry about their very
african independence of opinion and outspokenness, also extreme self-centeredness. and we will be poor, celie, and it
will be years no doubt before we even own a home. how will they manage the hostility towards them, having grown up
here? when i think of them in america i see them as much younger than they appear here. much more naive. the worst
we have had to endure here is indifference and a certain understandable shallowness in our personal
relationshipsâ€” excluding our relationship with catherine and tashi. after all, the olinka know we can leave, they must
stay. and, of course, none of this has t

had me a fine sister name nettie. i had me another fine woman friend name shug. i had me some fine children growing
up in africa, singing and writing verses. the first two months was hell though, i tell the world. but now shug's six months
is come and gone and she ain't come back. and i try to teach my heart not to want nothing it can't have.

besides, she give me so many good years. plus, she learning new things in her new life. now she and germaine staying
with one of her children.

dear celie, she wrote me. me and germaine ended up in tucson, arizona where one of my children live. the other two
alive and turned out well but they didn't want to see me. somebody told them i lives a evil life. this one say he want to
see his mama no matter what. he live in a little mud looking house like they have out here, call adobe, so you know i feels
right at home (smile). he a schoolteacher too and work on the indian reservation. they call him the black white man.

would have just love to hear they man say he beat his wife cause she wasn't them. shug one time was like that bout
annie julia. both of us messed over my first wife a scanless. and she never told nobody. plus, she didn't have nobody to
tell. after they married her off to me her folks behave like they'd throwed her down a well. or off the face of the earth. i
didn't want her. i wanted shug. but my daddy was the boss. he give me the wife he wanted me to have.

but shug spoke right up for you, celie, he say. she say albert, you been mistreating somebody i love. so as far as you
concern, i'm gone. i couldn't believe it, he say. all along in there we was as hot for each other as two pistols. excuse me,
he say. but we was. i tried to laugh it off. but she meant what she said.

i tried to tease her. you don't love old dumb celie, i said. she ugly and skinny and can't hold a candle to you. she can't
even screw.

what i want to say that for. from what she tell me, shug said, she don't have no re

ason to screw. you on and off like a
jackrabbit. plus, she say, celie say you not always clean. and she turn up her nose.

i wanted to kill you, said mr. and i did slap you around a couple of times. i never understood how you and shug got

along so well together and it bothered the hell out of me. when she was mean and nasty to you, i understood. but when i
looked around and the two of you was always doing each other's hair, i start to worry.

she still feel for you, i say.

yeah, he say. she feel like i'm her brother.

what so bad about that, i ast. don't her br

others love her?

them clowns, he say. they still act the fool i use to be.

well, i say, we all have to start somewhere if us want to do better, and our own self is what us have to hand.

i'm real sorry she left you, celie. i remember how i felt when she left me.

then the old devil put his arms around me and just stood there on the porch with me real quiet. way after while i bent
my stiff neck onto his shoulder. here us is, i thought, two old fools left over from love, keeping each other company under
the stars.

other times he want to know bout my children.

i told him you say they both wear long robes, sort of like dresses. that was the day he come to visit me while i was sewing
and ast me what was so special

took me long enough to notice you such good company, he say. and he laugh.

he ain't shug, but he begin to be somebody i can talk to.

and no matter how much the telegram said you must be drown, i still git letters from you.

dear celie,


after two and a half months adam and tashi returned! adam overtook tashi and her mother and some other members of
our compound as they were nearing the village where the white woman missionary had lived, but tashi would not hear of
turning back, nor would catherine, and so adam accompanied them to the mbeles encampment.

oh, he says, it is the most extraordinary place!

you know, celie, in africa there is a huge depression in the earth called the great rift valley, but it is on

e no country, no people, no mother and no husband and brother.

you'd have a sister, said olivia.

then adam spoke. he asked tashi to forgive his initial stupid response to the scarification. and to forgive the repugnance
he'd felt about the female initiation ceremony. he assured tashi that it was she he loved and that in america she would
have country, people, parents, sister, husband, brother and lover, and that whatever befell her in america would also be
his own choice and his own lot.

oh, celie.

so, the next day, our boy came to us with scars identical to tashi's on his cheeks.

and they are so happy. so happy, celie. tashi and adam omatangu.

samuel married them, of course, and all the people left in the compound came to wish them happiness and an
abundance of roofleaf forever. olivia stood up with the bride and a friend of adam'sâ€” a man too old to have joined the
mbeles â€” stood up with him. immediately after the wedding we left the compound, riding in a lorry that took us to a

and then, just when i know i can live content without shug, just when mr. done ask me to marry him again, this

time in the spirit as well as in the flesh, and just after i say naw, i still don't like frogs, but let's us be friends, shug write
me she coming home.

now. is this life or not?

i be so calm.

if she come, i be happy. if she don't, i be content.

and then i figure this the lesson i was suppose to learn.

us hug.

oh, the house look so nice, she say, when us git to her room. you know i love pink.

she say, i know albert and i bet he been up to something, with you looking as fine as you look.

when nettie's foot come down on the porch i almost die. i stand swaying, tween albert and shug. nettie stand swaying
tween samuel and i reckon it must be adam. then us both start to moan and cry. us totter toward one nother like us use
