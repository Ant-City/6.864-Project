     you are my lookingglass from night to morning.

what supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his
guest?

relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation
crown derby presented to him by his only daughter, millicent (milly),
he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served
extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the
viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife marion
(molly).

was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of
hospitality?

his attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he accepted
them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence epps’s massproduct,
the creature cocoa.

were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed,
reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to
