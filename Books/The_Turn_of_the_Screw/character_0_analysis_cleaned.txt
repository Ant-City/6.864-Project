the [CHARACTER] 
although the [CHARACTER] adores miles and flora when she
first meets them, she quickly becomes suspicious of their every
word and action, convinced that they hope to deceive her. she is
fickle, however, and frequently switches back to being absolutely
sure of their pure innocence. at these times, her affection for
the children can be intense. she embraces them often and with passion,
going so far as to kiss miles. the ambiguity of the text allows
these displays of affection to appear both harmless and inappropriate.
her volatile relationship with the children renders her an unreliable
narrator and a dubious source of information. according to douglas,
the [CHARACTER]'s confidant and admirer, she is "the most agreeable
person" he has ever known "in her position." however, he says also
that she was "in love," as though this is an excuse for her behavior,
which he admits is questionable. mrs. grose's increasing skepticism
casts doubt on the [CHARACTER]'s visions and fears and suggests that
the [CHARACTER] may indeed be losing her mind. 

the [CHARACTER], with her overabundant concern for the children
and her violent suspicions of them, may be regarded as either a
heroine or a villain. on one hand, she seems to be an ambitious
young woman who unwittingly places herself in a position in which
she is forced to struggle heroically to protect her charges from
supernatural forces. on the other hand, she seems to be a sheltered,
inexperienced young woman whose crush on her employer and nervous
exhaustion at being in charge of two strange children result in
an elaborate and ultimately dangerous fabrication or hallucination.
james provides only the [CHARACTER]'s side of the story, which may
be inaccurate in whole or in part. in any case, the [CHARACTER]'s
account is by no means the full account, which we never learn.
