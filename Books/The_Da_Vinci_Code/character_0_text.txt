earlier this evening, within the sanctuary of his penthouse apartment, bishop manuel aringarosa
had packed a small travel bag and dressed in a traditional black cassock. normally, he would have
wrapped a purple cincture around his waist, but tonight he would be traveling among the public,
and he preferred not to draw attention to his high office. only those with a keen eye would notice
his 14-karat gold bishop's ring with purple amethyst, large diamonds, and hand-tooled mitre-
crozier applique. throwing the travel bag over his shoulder, he said a silent prayer and left his
apartment, desc

"hello, sister," the man said in french.

sister sandrine sat up. what time is it? although she recognized her boss's voice, in fifteen years
she had never been awoken by him. the abbe was a deeply pious man who went home to bed
immediately after mass.

"i apologize if i have awoken you, sister," the abbe said, his own voice sounding groggy and on
edge. "i have a favor to ask of you. i just received a call from an influential american bishop.



perhaps you know him? manuel aringarosa?"

"the head of opus dei?" of course i know of him. who in the church doesn't? aringarosa's
conservative prelature had grown powerful in recent years. their ascension to grace was jump-
started in 1982 when pope john paul ii unexpectedly elevated them to a "personal prelature of the
pope," officially sanctioning all of their practices. suspiciously, opus dei's elevation occurred the
same year the wealthy sect allegedly had transferred almost one billion dollars into the vatican's
institute for

to a couch.

"thank you, my friend," the priest said in awkward french. "the offertory money is tempting for
thieves. you speak french in your sleep. do you also speak spanish?"

the ghost shook his head.

"what is your name?" he continued in broken french.

the ghost could not remember the name his parents had given him. all he heard were the taunting
gibes of the prison guards.

the priest smiled. "no hay problema. my name is manuel aringarosa. i am a missionary from
madrid. i was sent here to build a church for the obra de dios."

"where am i?" his voice sounded hollow.

"oviedo. in the north of spain."



"how did i get here?"

"someone left you on my doorstep. you were ill. i fed you. you've been here many days."

the ghost studied his young caretaker. years had passed since anyone had shown any kindness.
"thank you, father."

the priest touched his bloody lip. "it is i who am thankful, my friend."

contents of his briefcase.

the line began to ring.

a female voice answered. "direction centrale police judidaire. "

aringarosa felt himself hesitate. this was unexpected. "ah, yes... i was asked to call this number?"

"qui etes-vous?" the woman said. "your name?"

aringarosa was uncertain if he should reveal it. the french judicial police ?

"your name, monsieur?" the woman pressed.

"bishop manuel aringarosa."

"un moment. " there was a click on the line.

after a long wait, another man came on, his tone gruff and concerned. "bishop, i am glad i finally
reached you. you and i have much to discuss."

sophie stared deep into teabing's eyes and spoke in a steely tone. "i will never swear an oath with
my grandfather's murderer. except an oath that i will see you go to prison."

teabing's heart turned grave, then resolute. "i am sorry you feel that way, mademoiselle." he
turned and aimed the gun at langdon. "and you, robert? are you with me, or against me?"



chapter 100

bishop manuel aringarosa's body had endured many kinds of pain, and yet the searing heat of the
bullet wound in his chest felt profoundly foreign to him. deep and grave. not a wound of the
flesh... but closer to the soul.

he opened his eyes, trying to see, but the rain on his face blurred his vision. where am i? he could
feel powerful arms holding him, carrying his limp body like a rag doll, his black cassock flapping.



lifting a weary arm, he mopped his eyes and saw the man holding him was silas. the great albino

st him, carrying the damp, earthy scent of new life. with every living cell in his
broken body, silas prayed. he prayed for forgiveness. he prayed for mercy. and, above all, he
prayed for his mentor... bishop aringarosa... that the lord would not take him before his time. he
has so much work left to do.

the fog was swirling around him now, and silas felt so light that he was sure the wisps would
carry him away. closing his eyes, he said a final prayer.

from somewhere in the mist, the voice of manuel aringarosa whispered to him.

our lord is a good and merciful god.

silas's pain at last began to fade, and he knew the bishop was right.

it was late afternoon when the london sun broke through and the city began to dry. bezu fache
felt weary as he emerged from the interrogation room and hailed a cab. sir leigh teabing had
vociferously proclaimed his innocence, and yet from his incoherent rantings about the holy grail,



secret documents, and mysterious brotherhoods, fache suspected the w
