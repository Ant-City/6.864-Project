Uncle Reed - 
                Uncle Reed is Mrs. Reed's late husband. In her childhood, Jane believes
that she feels the presence of his ghost. Because he was always
fond of Jane and her mother (his sister), Uncle Reed made his wife
promise that she would raise Jane as her own child. It is a promise
that Mrs. Reed does not keep.
