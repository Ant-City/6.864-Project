George - 
      Edward's younger brother, George was in France at the beginning of the play, returning with reinforcements after his father's death. George joins his brothers' battles, until Edward marries Lady Gray. George breaks with his brother and joins Warwick, though he rejoins his brothers later and helps defeat Warwick. George receives the title of the Duke of Clarence from his brother, and he is often referred to as "Clarence" throughout the play and into Richard III. George is Richard's next target at the end of the play.
