this brought him to a stop.  â€˜now, to think of these vagabonds,â€™ said he,
â€˜attracting the young rabble from a model school.â€™

a space of stunted grass and dry rubbish being between him and the young
rabble, he took his eyeglass out of his waistcoat to look for any child
he knew by name, and might order off.  phenomenon almost incredible
though distinctly seen, what did he then behold but his own metallurgical
louisa, peeping with all her might through a hole in a deal board, and
his own mathematical thomas abasing himself on the ground to catch but a
hoof of the graceful equestrian tyrolean flower-act!

dumb with amazement, mr. gradgrind crossed to the spot where his family
was thus disgraced, laid his hand upon each erring child, and said:

â€˜louisa!!  thomas!!â€™

both rose, red and disconcerted.  but, louisa looked at her father with
more boldness than thomas did.  indeed, thomas did not look at him, b

gave himself up to be taken home like a machine.

â€˜in the name of wonder, idleness, and folly!â€™ said mr. gradgrind, leading
each away by a hand; â€˜what do you do here?â€™

â€˜wanted to see what it was like,â€™ returned louisa, shortly.

â€˜what it was like?â€™

â€˜yes, father.â€™

there was an air of jaded sullenness in them both, and particularly in
the girl: yet, struggling through the dissatisfaction of her face, there
was a light with nothing to rest upon, a fire with nothing to burn, a
starved imagination keeping life in itself somehow, which brightened its
expression.  not with the brightness natural to cheerful youth, but with
uncertain, eager, doubtful flashes, which had something painful in them,

roping its way.

she was a child now, of fifteen or sixteen; but at no distant day would
seem to become a woman all at once.  her father thought so as he looked
at her.  she was pretty.  would have been self-willed (he thought in his
eminently practical way) but for her bringing-up.

â€˜thomas, though i have the fact before me, i find it difficult to believe
that you, with your education and resources, should have brought your
sister to a scene like this.â€™

â€˜i brought _him_, father,â€™ said louisa, quickly.  â€˜i asked him to come.â€™

â€˜i am sorry to hear it.  i am very sorry indeed to hear it.  it makes
thomas no better, and it makes you worse, louisa.â€™

she looked at her father again, but no tear fell down her cheek.

â€˜you!  thomas and you, to whom the circle of the sciences is open; thomas
and you, who may be said to be replete with facts; thomas and you, who
have been trained to mathematical exactness; thomas and you, here!â€™ cried
mr. gradgrind.  â€˜in this degraded position!

  i am amazed.â€™

â€˜i was tired, father.  i have been tired a long time,â€™ said louisa.

â€˜tired?  of what?â€™ asked the astonished father.

â€˜i donâ€™t know of whatâ€”of everything, i think.â€™

â€˜say not another word,â€™ returned mr. gradgrind.  â€˜you are childish.  i
will hear no more.â€™  he did not speak again until they had walked some
half-a-mile in silence, when he gravely broke out with: â€˜what would your
best friends say, louisa?  do you attach no value to their good opinion?
what would mr. bounderby say?â€™  at the mention of this name, his daughter
stole a look at him, remarkable for its intense and searching character.
he saw nothing of it, for before he looked at her, she had again cast
down her eyes!

â€˜what,â€™ he repeated presently, â€˜would mr. bounderby say?â€™  all the way to
stone lodge, as with grave indignation he led the two delinquents home,
he repeated at intervals â€˜what would mr. bounderby say?â€™â€

eâ€”the education that made him wonâ€™t do for everybody,
he knows wellâ€”such and such his education was, however, and you may force
him to swallow boiling fat, but you shall never force him to suppress the
facts of his life.â€™

being heated when he arrived at this climax, josiah bounderby of coketown
stopped.  he stopped just as his eminently practical friend, still
accompanied by the two young culprits, entered the room.  his eminently
practical friend, on seeing him, stopped also, and gave louisa a
reproachful look that plainly said, â€˜behold your bounderby!â€™

â€˜well!â€™ blustered mr. bounderby, â€˜whatâ€™s the matter?  what is young
thomas in the dumps about?â€™

he spoke of young thomas, but he looked at louisa.

â€˜we were peeping at the circus,â€™ muttered louisa, haughtily, without
lifting up her eyes, â€˜and father caught us.â€™

â€˜and, mrs. gradgrind,â€™ said her husband in a lofty manner, â€˜i should as
soon have expected to find my children reading poetry.â€™

â€˜dear me,â
 
 ___________________________
 
€™ whimpered mrs. gradgrind.  â€˜how can you, louisa and thomas!  i
wonder at you.  i declare youâ€™re enough to make one regret ever having
had a family at all.  i have a great mind to say i wish i hadnâ€™t.  _then_
what would you have done, i should like to know?â€™

mr. gradgrind did not seem favourably impressed by these cogent remarks.
he frowned impatiently.

â€˜as if, with my head in its present throbbing state, you couldnâ€™t go and
look at the shells and minerals and things provided for you, instead of
circuses!â€™ said mrs. gradgrind.  
 
 ___________________________
 
â€˜you know, as well as i do, no young
people have circus masters, or keep circuses in cabinets, or attend
lectures about circuses.  what can you possibly want to know of circuses
then?  i am sure you have enough to do, if thatâ€™s what you want.  with my
head in its present state, i couldnâ€™t remember the mere names of half the
facts you have got to attend to.â€™

â€˜thatâ€™s the reason!â€™ pouted louisa.

â€˜donâ€™t tell me thatâ€™s the reason, because it canâ€™t be nothing of the
sort,â€™ said mrs. gradgrind.  â€˜go and be somethingological directly.â€™
mrs. gradgrind was not a scientific character, and usually dismissed her
children to their studies with this general injunction to choose their
pursuit.

in truth, mrs. gradgrindâ€™s stock of facts in general was woefully
defective; but mr. gradgrind in raising her to her high matrimonial
position, had been influenced by two reasons.  firstly,

as as free from any alloy of that nature, as any human
being not arrived at the perfection of an absolute idiot, ever was.

the simple circumstance of being left alone with her husband and mr.
bounderby, was sufficient to stun this admirable lady again without
collision between herself and any other fact.  so, she once more died
away, and nobody minded her.

â€˜bounderby,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, drawing a chair to the fireside, â€˜you
are always so interested in my young peopleâ€”particularly in louisaâ€”that i
make no apology for saying to you, i am very much vexed by this
discovery.  i have systematically devoted myself (as you know) to the
education of the reason of my family.  the reason is (as you know) the
only faculty to which education should be addressed.  â€˜and yet,
bounderby, it would appear from this unexpected circumstance of to-day,
though in itself a trifling one, as if something had crept into thomasâ€™s
and louisaâ€™s minds which isâ€”or rather, which is notâ€”i donâ€™t know

 with any interest at _me_; i know that.â€™

â€˜then comes the question; said the eminently practical father, with his
eyes on the fire, â€˜in what has this vulgar curiosity its rise?â€™

â€˜iâ€™ll tell you in what.  in idle imagination.â€™

â€˜i hope not,â€™ said the eminently practical; â€˜i confess, however, that the
misgiving _has_ crossed me on my way home.â€™

â€˜in idle imagination, gradgrind,â€™ repeated bounderby.  â€˜a very bad thing
for anybody, but a cursed bad thing for a girl like louisa.  i should ask
mrs. gradgrindâ€™s pardon for strong expressions, but that she knows very
well i am not a refined character.  whoever expects refinement in _me_
will be disappointed.  i hadnâ€™t a refined bringing up.â€™

â€˜whether,â€™ said gradgrind, pondering with his hands in his pockets, and
his cavernous eyes on the fire, â€˜whether any instructor or servant can
have suggested anything?  whether louisa or thomas can have been reading
anything?  whether, in spite of all precautions, any idl

â€˜cecilia jupe, by name,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, with something of a stricken
look at his friend.

â€˜now, stop a bit!â€™ cried bounderby again.  â€˜how did she come there?â€™

â€˜why, the fact is, i saw the girl myself, for the first time, only just
now.  she specially applied here at the house to be admitted, as not
regularly belonging to our town, andâ€”yes, you are right, bounderby, you
are right.â€™

â€˜now, stop a bit!â€™ cried bounderby, once more.  â€˜louisa saw her when she
came?â€™

â€˜louisa certainly did see her, for she mentioned the application to me.
but louisa saw her, i have no doubt, in mrs. gradgrindâ€™s presence.â€™

â€˜pray, mrs. gradgrind,â€™ said bounderby, â€˜what passed?â€™

â€˜oh, my poor health!â€™ returned mrs. gradgrind.  â€˜the girl wanted to come
to the school, and mr. gradgrind wanted girls to come to the school, and
louisa and thomas both said that the girl wanted to come, and that mr.
gradgrind wanted girls to come, and ho

being left to saunter in the hall a minute or two while mr. gradgrind
went up-stairs for the address, he opened the door of the childrenâ€™s
study and looked into that serene floor-clothed apartment, which,
notwithstanding its book-cases and its cabinets and its variety of
learned and philosophical appliances, had much of the genial aspect of a
room devoted to hair-cutting.  louisa languidly leaned upon the window
looking out, without looking at anything, while young thomas stood
sniffing revengefully at the fire.  adam smith and malthus, two younger
gradgrinds, were out at lecture in custody; and little jane, after
manufacturing a good deal of moist pipe-clay on her face with
slate-pencil and tears, had fallen asleep over vulgar fractions.

â€˜itâ€™s all right now, louisa: itâ€™s all right, young thomas,â€™ said mr.
bounderby; â€˜you wonâ€™t do so any more.  iâ€™ll answe

â€˜you can take one, mr. bounderby,â€™ returned louisa, when she had coldly
paused, and slowly walked across the room, and ungraciously raised her
cheek towards him, with her face turned away.

â€˜always my pet; ainâ€™t you, louisa?â€™ said mr. bounderby.  â€˜good-bye,
louisa!â€™

he went his way, but she stood on the same spot, rubbing the cheek he had
kissed, with her handkerchief, until it was burning red.  she was still
doing this, five minutes afterwards.

â€˜what are you about, loo?â€™ her brother sulkily remonstrated.  â€˜youâ€™ll rub
a hole in your face.â€™

â€˜you may cut the piece out with your penknife if you like, tom.  i
wouldnâ€™t cry!â€™

upon this, mr. childers politely betook himself, with his equestrian
walk, to the landing outside the door, and there stood stroking his face,
and softly whistling.  while thus engaged, he overheard such phrases in
mr. bounderbyâ€™s voice as â€˜no.  _i_ say no.  i advise you not.  i say by
no means.â€™  while, from mr. gradgrind, he heard in his much lower tone
the words, â€˜but even as an example to louisa, of what this pursuit which
has been the subject of a vulgar curiosity, leads to and ends in.  think
of it, bounderby, in that point of view.â€™

meanwhile, the various members of slearyâ€™s company gradually gathered
together from the upper regions, where they were quartered, and, from
standing about, talking in low voices to one another and to mr. childers,
gradually insinuated themselves and him into the room.  there were two or
three handsome young women among them, with their two or three

â€˜she must wait, maâ€™am,â€™ answered bounderby, â€˜till i know myself.  we
shall have tom gradgrind down here presently, i suppose.  if he should
wish her to remain here a day or two longer, of course she can, maâ€™am.â€™

â€˜of course she can if you wish it, mr. bounderby.â€™

â€˜i told him i would give her a shake-down here, last night, in order that
he might sleep on it before he decided to let her have any association
with louisa.â€™

â€˜indeed, mr. bounderby?  very thoughtful of you!â€™  mrs. sparsitâ€™s
coriolanian nose underwent a slight expansion of the nostrils, and her
black eyebrows contracted as she took a sip of tea.

â€˜itâ€™s tolerably clear to _me_,â€™ said bounderby, â€˜that the little puss can
get small good out of such companionship.â€™

â€˜are you speaking of young miss gradgrind, mr. bounderby?â€™

â€˜yes, maâ€™am, iâ€™m speaking of louisa.â€™

â€˜your observation being limited to â€œlittle puss,â€â€™

said mrs. sparsit,
â€˜and there being two little girls in question, i did not know which might
be indicated by that expression.â€™

â€˜louisa,â€™ repeated mr. bounderby.  â€˜louisa, louisa.â€™

â€˜you are quite another father to louisa, sir.â€™  mrs. sparsit took a
little more tea; and, as she bent her again contracted eyebrows over her
steaming cup, rather looked as if her classical countenance were invoking
the infernal gods.

â€˜if you had said i was another father to tomâ€”young tom, i mean, not my
friend tom gradgrindâ€”you might have been nearer the mark.  i am going to
take young tom into my office.  going to have him under my wing, maâ€™am.â€™

â€˜indeed?  rather young for that, is he not, sir?â€™  mrs. spiritâ€™s â€˜

nd of social widowhood upon
her.  â€˜it is unquestionably true.â€™

mr. bounderby, bending himself at the knees, literally embraced his legs
in his great satisfaction and laughed aloud.  mr. and miss gradgrind
being then announced, he received the former with a shake of the hand,
and the latter with a kiss.

â€˜can jupe be sent here, bounderby?â€™ asked mr. gradgrind.

certainly.  so jupe was sent there.  on coming in, she curtseyed to mr.
bounderby, and to his friend tom gradgrind, and also to louisa; but in
her confusion unluckily omitted mrs. sparsit.  observing this, the
blustrous bounderby had the following remarks to make:

â€˜now, i tell you what, my girl.  the name of that lady by the teapot, is
mrs. sparsit.  that lady acts as mistress of this house, and she is a
highly connected lady.  consequently, if ever you come again into any
room in this house, you will make a short stay in it if you donâ€™t behave
towards that lady in your most respectful manner.  now, i donâ€™t care a

 mrs. sparsit,â€™ said bounderby, â€˜that
this was merely an oversight.  very likely.  however, as you are aware,
maâ€™am, i donâ€™t allow of even oversights towards you.â€™

â€˜you are very good indeed, sir,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit, shaking her head
with her state humility.  â€˜it is not worth speaking of.â€™

sissy, who all this time had been faintly excusing herself with tears in
her eyes, was now waved over by the master of the house to mr. gradgrind.
she stood looking intently at him, and louisa stood coldly by, with her
eyes upon the ground, while he proceeded thus:

â€˜jupe, i have made up my mind to take you into my house; and, when you
are not in attendance at the school, to employ you about mrs. gradgrind,
who is rather an invalid.  i have explained to miss louisaâ€”this is miss
louisaâ€”the miserable but natural end of your late career; and you are to
expressly understand that the whole of that subject is past, and is not
to be referred to any more.  from this time you begin your

his voice.

â€˜only to father and merrylegs, sir.  at least i mean to father, when
merrylegs was always there.â€™

â€˜never mind merrylegs, jupe,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, with a passing frown.
â€˜i donâ€™t ask about him.  i understand you to have been in the habit of
reading to your father?â€™

â€˜o, yes, sir, thousands of times.  they were the happiestâ€”o, of all the
happy times we had together, sir!â€™

it was only now when her sorrow broke out, that louisa looked at her.

â€˜and what,â€™ asked mr. gradgrind, in a still lower voice, â€˜did you read to
your father, jupe?â€™

â€˜about the fairies, sir, and the dwarf, and the hunchback, and the
genies,â€™ she sobbed out; â€˜and aboutâ€”â€™

â€˜hush!â€™ said mr. gradgrind, â€˜that is enough.  never breathe a word of
such destructive nonsense any more.  bounderby, this is a case for rigid
training, and i shall observe it with interest.â€™

â€˜well,â€™ returned mr. bounderby, â€˜i have given you my opin

i shouldnâ€™t do as you do.  but, very well, very well.  since you are bent
upon it, _very_ well!â€™

so, mr. gradgrind and his daughter took cecilia jupe off with them to
stone lodge, and on the way louisa never spoke one word, good or bad.
and mr. bounderby went about his daily pursuits.  and mrs. sparsit got
behind her eyebrows and meditated in the gloom of that retreat, all the
evening.



chapter viii
never wonder


let us strike the key-note again, before pursuing the tune.

when she was half a dozen years younger, louisa had been overheard to
begin a conversation with her brother one day, by saying â€˜tom, i
wonderâ€™â€”upon which mr. gradgrind, who was the person overhearing, stepped
forth
 
 ___________________________
 
 into the light and said, â€˜louisa, never wonder!â€™

herein lay the spring of the mechanical art and mystery of educating the
reason without stooping to the cultivation of the sentiments and
affections.  never wonder.  by means of addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division, settle everything somehow, and never
wonder.  bring to me, says mâ€™choakumchild, yonder baby just able to walk,
and i will engage that it shall never wonder.

now, besides very many babies just able to walk, there happened to be in
coketown a consi

  i canâ€™t talk to you so as to
lighten your mind, for i never see any amusing sights or read any amusing
books that it would be a pleasure or a relief to you to talk about, when
you are tired.â€™

â€˜well, no more do i.  i am as bad as you in that respect; and i am a mule
too, which youâ€™re not.  if father was determined to make me either a prig
or a mule, and i am not a prig, why, it stands to reason, i must be a
mule.  and so i am,â€™ said tom, desperately.

â€˜itâ€™s a great pity,â€™ said louisa, after another pause, and speaking
thoughtfully out of her dark corner: â€˜itâ€™s a great pity, tom.  itâ€™s very
unfortunate for both of us.â€™

â€˜oh!  you,â€™ said tom; â€˜you are a girl, loo, and a girl comes out of it
better than a boy does.  i donâ€™t miss anything in you.  you are the only
pleasure i haveâ€”you can brighten even this placeâ€”and you can always lead
me as you like.â€™

â€˜you are a dear brother, tom; and while you think i can do such things, i
donâ€™t so much mind knowing
 
 ___________________________
 
 â€˜another of the advantages, i suppose, of being a girl.â€™

â€˜tom,â€™ enquired his sister, slowly, and in a curious tone, as if she were
reading what she asked in the fire, and it was not quite plainly written
there, â€˜do you look forward with any satisfaction to this change to mr.
bounderbyâ€™s?â€™

â€˜why, thereâ€™s one thing to be said of it,â€™ returned tom, pushing his
chair from him, and standing up; â€˜it will be getting away from home.â€™

â€˜there is one thing to be said of it,â€™ louisa repeated in her former
curious tone; â€˜it will be getting away from home.  yes.â€™

â€˜not but what i shall be very unwilling, both to leave you, loo, and to
leave you here.  but i must go, you know, whether i like it or not; and i
had better go where i can take with me some advantage of your influence,
than where i should lose it altogether.  donâ€™t you see?â€™

â€˜yes, tom.â€™

the answer was so long in coming, though there was no indecision in it,
that tom went and leaned on the back of he

om her point of view, and see what he
could make of it.

â€˜except that it is a fire,â€™ said tom, â€˜it looks to me as stupid and blank
as everything else looks.  what do you see in it?  not a circus?â€™

â€˜i donâ€™t see anything in it, tom, particularly.  but since i have been
looking at it, i have been wondering about you and me, grown up.â€™

â€˜wondering again!â€™ said tom.

â€˜i have such unmanageable thoughts,â€™ returned his sister, â€˜that they
_will_ wonder.â€™

â€˜then i beg of you, louisa,â€™ said mrs. gradgrind, who had opened the door
without being heard, â€˜to do nothing of that description, for goodnessâ€™
sake, you inconsiderate girl, or i shall never hear the last of it from
your father.  and, thomas, it is really shameful, with my poor head
continually wearing me out, that a boy brought up as you have been, and
whose education has cost what yours has, should be found encouraging his
sister to wonder, when he knows his father has expressly said that she is
not to do it.â€™

louisa denied tomâ€™s participation in the offence; but her mother stopped
her with the conclusive answer, â€˜louisa, donâ€™t tell me, in my state of
health; for unless you had been encouraged, it is morally and physically
impossible that you could have done it.â€™

â€˜i was encouraged by nothing, mother, but by looking at the red sparks
dropping out of the fire, and whitening and dying.  it made me think,
after all, how short my life would be, and how little i could hope to do
in it.â€™

â€˜nonsense!â€™ said mrs. gradgrind, rendered almost energetic.  â€˜nonsense!
donâ€™t stand there and tell me such stuff,

have seen!  after i have heard you myself, when the whole of my right

would that they should do unto me.â€™

mr. gradgrind observed, shaking his head, that all this was very bad;
that it showed the necessity of infinite grinding at the mill of
knowledge, as per system, schedule, blue book, report, and tabular
statements a to z; and that jupe â€˜must be kept to it.â€™  so jupe was kept
to it, and became low-spirited, but no wiser.

â€˜it would be a fine thing to be you, miss louisa!â€™ she said, one night,
when louisa had endeavoured to make her perplexities for next day
something clearer to her.

â€˜do you think so?â€™

â€˜i should know so much, miss louisa.  all that is difficult to me now,
would be so easy then.â€™

â€˜you might not be the better for it, sissy.â€™

sissy submitted, after a little hesitation, â€˜i should not be the worse,
miss louisa.â€™  to which miss louisa answered, â€˜i donâ€™t know that.â€™

there had been so little communication between these twoâ
 
 ___________________________
 
€”both because
life at stone lodge went monotonously round like a piece of machinery
which discouraged human interference, and because of the prohibition
relative to sissyâ€™s past careerâ€”that they were still almost strangers.
sissy, with her dark eyes wonderingly directed to louisaâ€™s face, was
uncertain whether to say more or to remain silent.

â€˜you are more useful to my mother, and more pleasant with her than i can
ever be,â€™ louisa resumed.  â€˜you are pleasanter to yourself, than _i_ am
to _my_self.â€™

â€˜but, if you please, miss louisa,â€™ sissy pleaded, â€˜i amâ€”o so stupid!â€™

louisa, with a brighter laugh than usual, told her she would be wiser
by-and-by.

â€˜you donâ€™t know,â€™ said sissy, half crying, â€˜what a stupid girl i am.  all
through school hours i make mistakes.  mr. and mrs. mâ€™choakumchild call
me up, over and over again, regularly to make mistakes.  i canâ€™t help

â€˜o no!â€™ she eagerly returned.  â€˜they know everything.â€™

â€˜tell me some of your mistakes.â€™

â€˜i am almost ashamed,â€™ said sissy, with reluctance.  â€˜but to-day, for
instance, mr. mâ€™choakumchild was explaining to us about natural
prosperity.â€™

â€˜national, i think it must have been,â€™ observed louisa.

â€˜yes, it was.â€”but isnâ€™t it the same?â€™ she timidly asked.

â€˜you had better say, national, as he said so,â€™ returned louisa, with her
dry reserve.

â€˜national prosperity.  and he said, now, this schoolroom is a nation.
and in this nation, there are fifty millions of money.  isnâ€™t this a
prosperous nation?  girl number twenty, isnâ€™t this a prosperous nation,
and aâ€™nâ€™t you in a thriving state?â€™

â€˜what did you say?â€™ asked louisa.

â€˜miss louisa, i said i didnâ€™t know.

i thought i couldnâ€™t know whether it

said sissy, wiping her eyes.

â€˜that was a great mistake of yours,â€™ observed louisa.

â€˜yes, miss louisa, i know it was, now.  then mr. mâ€™choakumchild said he
would try me again.  and he said, this schoolroom is an immense town, and
in it there are a million of inhabitants, and only five-and-twenty are
starved to death in the streets, in the course of a year.  what is your
remark on that proportion?  and my remark wasâ€”for i couldnâ€™t think of a
better oneâ€”that i thought it must be just as hard upon those who were
starved, whether the others were a million, or a million million.  and

â€˜of course it was.â€™

â€˜then mr. mâ€™choakumchild said he would try me once more.  and he said,

â€˜yes, miss louisaâ€”they always remind me of stutterings, and thatâ€™s
another of my mistakesâ€”of accidents upon the sea.  and i find (mr.
mâ€™choakumchild said) that in a given time a hundred thousand persons went
to sea on long voyages, and only five hundred of them were drowned or
burnt to death.  what is the percentage?  and i said, miss;â€™ here sissy
fairly sobbed as confessing with extreme contrition to her greatest
error; â€˜i said it was nothing.â€™

â€˜nothing, sissy?â€™

â€˜nothing, missâ€”to the rel

killed.  i shall never learn,â€™ said sissy.  â€˜and the worst of all is,
that although my poor father wished me so much to learn, and although i
am so anxious to learn, because he wished me to, i am afraid i donâ€™t like
it.â€™

louisa stood looking at the pretty modest head, as it drooped abashed
before her, until it was raised again to glance at her face.  then she
asked:

â€˜did your father know so much himself, that he wished you to be well
taught too, sissy?â€™

sissy hesitated before replying, and so plainly showed her sense that
they were entering on forbidden ground, that louisa added, â€˜no one hears
us; and if any one did, i am sure no harm could be found in such an
innocent question.â€™

â€˜no, miss louisa,â€™ answ

head; â€˜father knows very little indeed.  itâ€™s as much as he can do to
write; and itâ€™s more than people in general can do to read his writing.
though itâ€™s plain to _me_.â€™

â€˜your mother?â€™

â€˜father says she was quite a scholar.  she died when i was born.  she
was;â€™ sissy made the terrible communication nervously; â€˜she was a
dancer.â€™

â€˜did your father love her?â€™  louisa asked these questions with a strong,
wild, wandering interest peculiar to her; an interest gone astray like a
banished creature, and hiding in solitary places.

â€˜o yes!  as dearly as he loves me.  father loved me, first, for her sake.
he carried me about with him when i was quite a baby.  we have never been
asunder from that time.â€™

â€˜yet he leaves you now, sissy?â€™

â€˜only for my good.  nobody understands him as i do; nobody knows him as i
do.  when he left me for my goodâ€”he never wou

â€˜to make the people laugh?â€™ said louisa, with a nod of intelligence.

â€˜yes.  but they wouldnâ€™t laugh sometimes, and then father cried.  lately,
they very often wouldnâ€™t laugh, and he used to come home despairing.
fatherâ€™s not like most.  those who didnâ€™t know him as well as i do, and
didnâ€™t love him as dearly as i do, might believe he was not quite right.
sometimes they played tricks upon him; but they never knew how he felt
them, and shrunk up, when he was alone with me.  he was far, far timider
than they thought!â€™

ing down her face.  â€˜i hope so, and father
said i was.  it was because he grew so scared and trembling, and because
he felt himself to be a poor, weak, ignorant, helpless man (those used to
be his words), that he wanted me so much to know a great deal, and be
different from him.  i used to read to him to cheer his courage, and he
was very fond of that.  they were wrong booksâ€”i am never to speak of them
hereâ€”but we didnâ€™t know there was any harm in them.â€™

â€˜and he liked them?â€™ said louisa, with a searching gaze on sissy all this
time.

â€˜o very much!  they kept him, many times, from what did him real harm.
and often and often of a night, he used to forget all his troubles in
wondering whether the sultan would let the lady go on with the story, or
would have her head cut off before it was finished.â€™

â€˜and your father was always kind?  to the last?â€™ asked louisa
contravening the great principle, and wondering very much.

â€˜always, always!â€™ returned sissy, clasping her ha

than i can tell.  he was angry only one night, and that was not to me,
but merrylegs.  merrylegs;â€™ she whispered the awful fact; â€˜is his
performing dog.â€™

â€˜why was he angry with the dog?â€™ louisa demanded.

â€˜father, soon after they came home from performing, told merrylegs to
jump up on the backs of the two chairs and stand across themâ€”which is one
of his tricks.  he looked at father, and didnâ€™t do it at once.
everything of fatherâ€™s had gone wrong that night, and he hadnâ€™t pleased
the public at all.  he cried out that the very dog knew he was failing,
and had no compassion on him.  then he beat the dog, and i was
frightened, and said, â€œfather, father!  pray donâ€™t hurt the

creature who
is so fond of you!  o heaven forgive you, father, stop!â€  and he stopped,
and the dog was bloody, and father lay down crying on the floor with the
dog in his arms, and the dog licked his face.â€™

louisa saw that she was sobbing; and going to her, kissed her, took her
hand, and sat down beside her.

â€˜finish by telling me how your father left you, sissy.  now that i have
asked you so much, tell me the end.  the blame, if there is any blame, is
mine, not yours.â€™

â€˜dear miss louisa,â€™ said sissy, covering her eyes, and sobbing yet; â€˜i
came home from the school that afternoon, and found poor father just come
home too, from the booth.  and he sat rocking himself over the fire, as
if he was in pain.  and i said, â€œhave you hurt yourself, father?â€ (as he
did sometimes, like they all did), and he said, â€œa little, my darling.â€
and when i came to stoop down and look up at his face, i saw that he was
crying.  the more i spoke to him, the more he hid his face; and at fir

 bit more company to him yet, and looked in
at the door, and said, â€œfather dear, shall i take merrylegs?â€  father
shook his head and said, â€œno, sissy, no; take nothing thatâ€™s known to be
mine, my darling;â€ and i left him sitting by the fire.  then the thought
must have come upon him, poor, poor father! of going away to try
something for my sake; for when i came back, he was gone.â€™

â€˜i say!  look sharp for old bounderby, loo!â€™ tom remonstrated.

â€˜thereâ€™s no more to tell, miss louisa.  i keep the nine oils ready for
him, and i know he will come back.  every letter that i see in mr.
gradgrindâ€™s hand takes my breath away and blinds my eyes, for i think it
comes from father, or from mr. sleary about father.  mr. sleary promised
to write as soon as ever father should be heard of, and i trust to him to
keep his word.â€™

â€˜do look sharp for old bounderby, loo!â€™ said tom, with an impatient
whistle.  â€˜heâ€™ll be off if you donâ€™t look sharp!â€™

after this, whenever sissy

dropped a curtsey to mr. gradgrind in the
presence of his family, and said in a faltering way, â€˜i beg your pardon,
sir, for being troublesomeâ€”butâ€”have you had any letter yet about me?â€™
louisa would suspend the occupation of the moment, whatever it was, and
look for the reply as earnestly as sissy did.  and when mr. gradgrind
regularly answered, â€˜no, jupe, nothing of the sort,â€™ the trembling of
sissyâ€™s lip would be repeated in louisaâ€™s face, and her eyes would follow
sissy with compassion to the door.  mr. gradgrind usually improved these
occasions by remarking, when she was gone, that if jupe had been properly
trained from an early age she would have remonstrated to herself on sound
principles the baselessness of these fantastic hopes.  yet it did seem
(though not to him, for he saw nothing of it) as if fantastic hope could
take as strong a hold as fact.

this observation must be limited exclusively to his daughter.  as

chapter xiv
the great manufacturer


time went on in coketown like its own machinery: so much material wrought
up, so much fuel consumed, so many powers worn out, so much money made.
but, less inexorable than iron, steel, and brass, it brought its varying
seasons even into that wilderness of smoke and brick, and made the only
stand that ever _was_ made in the place against its direful uniformity.

â€˜louisa is becoming,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, â€˜almost a young woman.â€™

time, with his innumerable horse-power, worked away, not minding what
anybody said, and presently turned out young thomas a foot taller than
when his father had last taken particular notice of him.

â€˜thomas is becoming,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, â€˜almost a young man.â€™

time passed thomas on in the mill, while his father was thinking about
it, and there he stood in a long-tailed coat and a stiff shirt-collar.

â€˜really,â€™ said

â€˜donâ€™t shed tears,â€™ said mr. gradgrind.  â€˜donâ€™t shed tears.  i donâ€™t
complain of you.  you are an affectionate, earnest, good young
womanâ€”andâ€”and we must make that do.â€™

â€˜thank you, sir, very much,â€™ said sissy, with a grateful curtsey.

â€˜you are useful to mrs. gradgrind, and (in a generally pervading way) you
are serviceable in the family also; so i understand from miss louisa,
and, indeed, so i have observed myself.  i therefore hope,â€™ said mr.
gradgrind, â€˜that you can make yourself happy in those relations.â€™

â€˜i should have nothing to wish, sir, ifâ€”â€™

â€˜i understand you,â€™ said mr. gradgrind; â€˜you still refer to your father.
i have heard from miss louisa that you still preserve that bottle.  well!
if your training in the science of arriving at exact results had been
more successful, you would have been wiser on these points.  i will say
no more.â€™

isy and rather dirty machinery, in a
by-comer, and made him member of parliament for coketown: one of the
respected members for ounce weights and measures, one of the
representatives of the multiplication table, one of the deaf honourable
gentlemen, dumb honourable gentlemen, blind honourable gentlemen, lame
honourable gentlemen, dead honourable gentlemen, to every other
consideration.  else wherefore live we in a christian land, eighteen
hundred and odd years after our master?

all this while, louisa had been passing on, so quiet and reserved, and so
much given to watching the bright ashes at twilight as they fell into the
grate, and became extinct, that from the period when her father had said
she was almost a young womanâ€”which seemed but yesterdayâ€”she had scarcely
attracted his notice again, when he found her quite a young woman.

â€˜quite a young woman,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, musing.  â€˜dear me!â€™

soon after this discovery, he became more thoughtful than usual for
several days, an

d seemed much engrossed by one subject.  on a certain
night, when he was going out, and louisa came to bid him good-bye before
his departureâ€”as he was not to be home until late and she would not see
him again until the morningâ€”he held her in his arms, looking at her in
his kindest manner, and said:

â€˜my dear louisa, you are a woman!â€™

she answered with the old, quick, searching look of the night when she
was found at the circus; then cast down her eyes.  â€˜yes, father.â€™

â€˜my dear,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, â€˜i must speak with you alone and
seriously.  come to me in my room after breakfast to-morrow, will you?â€™

â€˜yes, father.â€™

â€˜your hands are rather cold, louisa.  are you not well?â€™

â€˜quite well, father.â€™

â€˜and cheerful?â€™

she looked at him again, and smiled in her peculiar manner. 
 
 ___________________________
 
 â€˜i am as
cheerful, father, as i usually am, or usually have been.â€™

â€˜thatâ€™s well,â€™ said mr. gradgrind.  so, he kissed her and went away; and
louisa returned to the serene apartment of the hair-cutting character,
and leaning her elbow on her hand, looked again at the short-lived sparks
that so soon subsided into ashes.

â€˜are you there, loo?â€™ said her brother, looking in at the door.  he was
quite a young gentleman of pleasure now, and not quite a prepossessing
one.

â€˜dear tom,â€™ she answered, rising and embracing him, â€˜how long it is since
you have been to see me!â€™

â€˜why, i have been otherwise engaged, loo, in the evenings; and
 
 ___________________________
 
€™

â€˜no, tom.  but he told me to-night that he wished to do so in the
morning.â€™

â€˜ah!  thatâ€™s what i mean,â€™ said tom.  â€˜do you know where he is
to-night?â€™â€”with a very deep expression.

â€˜no.â€™

â€˜then iâ€™ll tell you.  heâ€™s with old bounderby.  they are having a regular
confab together up at the bank.  why at the bank, do you think?  well,
iâ€™ll tell you again.  to keep mrs. sparsitâ€™s ears as far off as possible,
i expect.â€™

with her hand upon her brotherâ€™s shoulder, louisa still stood looking at
the fire.  her brother glanced at her face with greater interest than
usual, and, encircling her waist with his arm, drew her coaxingly to him.

â€˜you are very fond of me, anâ€™t you, loo?â€™

â€˜indeed i am, tom, though you do let such long intervals go by without
coming to see me.â€™

â€˜well, sister of mine,â€™ said tom, â€˜when you say that, you are near my
thoughts.  we might be so much oftener togetherâ€”mightnâ€™t we?  always
together, almostâ€”mightnâ€™t we?  it

 astronomer within should arrange the starry
universe solely by pen, ink, and paper, so mr. gradgrind, in _his_
observatory (and there are many like it), had no need to cast an eye upon
the teeming myriads of human beings around him, but could settle all
their destinies on a slate, and wipe out all their tears with one dirty
little bit of sponge.

to this observatory, then: a stern room, with a deadly statistical clock
in it, which measured every second with a beat like a rap upon a
coffin-lid; louisa repaired on the appointed morning.  a window looked
towards coketown; and when she sat down near her fatherâ€™s table, she saw
the high chimneys and the long tracts of smoke looming in the heavy
distance gloomily.

â€˜my dear louisa,â€™ said her father, â€˜i prepared you last night to give me
your serious attention in the conversation we are now going to have
together.  you have been so well trained, and you do, i am happy to say,
so much justice to the education you have received, that i have

confidence in your good sense.  you are not impulsive, you are not
romantic, you are accustomed to view everything from the strong
dispassionate ground of reason and calculation.  from that ground alone,
i know you will view and consider what i am going to communicate.â€™

he waited, as if he would have been glad that she said something.  but
she said never a word.

â€˜louisa, my dear, you are the subject of a proposal of marriage that has
been made to me.â€™

again he waited, and again she answered not one word.  this so far
surprised him, as to induce him gently to repeat, â€˜a proposal of
marriage, my dear.â€™  to which she returned, without any visible emotion
whatever:

â€˜i hear you, father.  i am attending, i assure you.â€™

â€˜well!â€™ said mr. gradgrind, breaking into a smile, after being for the
moment at a loss, â€˜you are even more dispassionate than i e

louisa.  or, perhaps, you are not unprepared for the announcement i have
it in charge to make?â€™

â€˜i cannot say that, father, until i hear it.  prepared or unprepared, i
wish to hear it all from you.  i wish to hear you state it to me,
father.â€™

strange to relate, mr. gradgrind was not so collected at this moment as
his daughter was.  he took a paper-knife in his hand, turned it over,
laid it down, took it up again, and even then had to look along the blade
of it, considering how to go on.

at you say, my dear louisa, is perfectly reasonable.  i have
undertaken then to let you know thatâ€”in short, that mr. bounderby has
informed me that he has long watched your progress with particular
interest and pleasure, and has long hoped that the time might ultimately
arrive when he should offer you his hand in marriage.  that time, to
which he has so long, and certainly with great constancy, looked forward,
is now come.  mr. bounderby has made his proposal of marriage to me, and
has entreated me to make it known to

silence between them.  the deadly statistical clock very hollow.  the
distant smoke very black and heavy.

â€˜father,â€™ said louisa, â€˜do you think i love mr. bounderby?â€™

mr. gradgrind was extremely discomfited by this unexpected question.
â€˜well, my child,â€™ he returned, â€˜iâ€”reallyâ€”cannot take upon myself to say.â€™

â€˜father,â€™ pursued louisa in exactly the same voice as before, â€˜do you ask
me to love mr. bounderby?â€™

â€˜my dear louisa, no.  no.  i ask nothing.â€™

â€˜father,â€™ she still pursued, â€˜does mr. bounderby ask me to love him?â€™

â€˜really, my dear,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, â€˜it is difficult to answer your
questionâ€”â€™

â€˜difficult to answer it, yes or no, father?

â€˜certainly, my dear.  because;â€™ here was something to demonstrate, and it
set him up again; â€˜because the reply depends so materially, louisa, on

 
 ___________________________
 
 the injustice, of pretending
to anything fanciful, fantastic, or (i am using synonymous terms)
sentimental.  mr. bounderby would have seen you grow up under his eyes,
to very little purpose, if he could so far forget what is due to your
good sense, not to say to his, as to address you from any such ground.
therefore, perhaps the expression itselfâ€”i merely suggest this to you, my
dearâ€”may be a little misplaced.â€™

â€˜what would you advise me to use in its stead, father?â€™

â€˜why, my dear louisa,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, completely recovered by this
time, â€˜i would advise you (since you ask me) to consider this question,
as you have been accustomed to consider every other question, simply as
one of tangible fact.  the ignorant and the giddy may embarrass such
subjects with irrelevant fancies, and other absurdities that have no
existence, properly viewedâ€”really no existenceâ€”but it is no compliment to
you to say, that you know better.  now, what are the facts of this case?

showing the wide prevalence of this law, that among the natives of the
british possessions in india, also in a considerable part of china, and
among the calmucks of tartary, the best means of computation yet
furnished us by travellers, yield similar results.  the disparity i have
mentioned, therefore, almost ceases to be disparity, and (virtually) all
but disappears.â€™

â€˜what do you recommend, father,â€™ asked louisa, her reserved composure not
in the least affected by these gratifying results, â€˜that i should
substitute for the term i used just now?  for the misplaced expression?â€™

â€˜louisa,â€™ returned her father, â€˜it appears to me that nothing can be
plainer.  confining yourself rigidly to fact, the question of fact you
state to yourself is: does mr. bounderby ask me to marry him?  yes, he
does.  the sole remaining question then is: shall i marry him?  i think
nothing can be plainer than that?â€™


 
 ___________________________
 
â€˜shall i marry him?â€™ repeated louisa, with great deliberation.

â€˜precisely.  and it is satisfactory to me, as your father, my dear
louisa, to know that you do not come to the consideration of that
question with the previous habits of mind, and habits of life, that
belong to many young women.â€™

â€˜no, father,â€™ she returned, â€˜i do not.â€™

â€˜i now leave you to judge for yourself,â€™ said mr. gradgrind.  â€˜i have
stated the case, as such cases are usually stated among practical minds;
i have stated it, as the case of your mother and myself was stated in its
time.  the rest, my dear louisa, is for you to decide.â€™

from the

 the last trumpet ever to be
sounded shall blow even algebra to wreck.  the barriers were too many and
too high for such a leap.  with his unbending, utilitarian,
matter-of-fact face, he hardened her again; and the moment shot away into
the plumbless depths of the past, to mingle with all the lost
opportunities that are drowned there.

removing her eyes from him, she sat so long looking silently towards the
town, that he said, at length: â€˜are you consulting the chimneys of the
coketown works, louisa?â€™

â€˜there seems to be nothing there but languid and monotonous smoke.  yet
when the night comes, fire bursts out, father!â€™ she answered, turning
quickly.

â€˜of course i know that, louisa.  i do not see the application of the
remark.â€™  to do him justice he did not, at all.

she passed it away with a slight motion of her hand, and concentrating
her attention upon him again, said, â€˜father, i have often thought that
life is very short.â€™â€”this was so distinctly one of his subjects that

interposed.

â€˜it is short, no doubt, my dear.  still, the average duration of human
life is proved to have increased of late years.  the calculations of
various life assurance and annuity offices, among other figures which
cannot go wrong, have established the fact.â€™

â€˜i speak of my own life, father.â€™

â€˜o indeed?  still,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, â€˜i need not point out to you,
louisa, that it is governed by the laws which govern lives in the
aggregate.â€™

â€˜while it lasts, i would wish to do the little i can, and the little i am
fit for.  what does it matter?â€™

mr. gradgrind seemed rather at a loss to understand the last four words;
replying, â€˜how, matter?  what matter, my dear?â€™

â€˜mr. bounderby,â€™ she went on in a steady, straight way, without regarding
this, â€˜asks me to marry him.  the question i have to ask myself is, shall
i marry him?  that is so, father,

ow what i said.â€™

â€˜it is quite right, my dear,â€™ retorted her father approvingly, â€˜to be
exact.  i will observe your very proper request.  have you any wish in
reference to the period of your marriage, my child?â€™

â€˜none, father.  what does it matter!â€™

mr. gradgrind had drawn his chair a little nearer to her, and taken her
hand.  but, her repetition of these words seemed to strike with some
little discord on his ear.  he paused to look at her, and, still holding
her hand, said:

â€˜louisa, i have not considered it essential to ask you one question,
because the possibility implied in it appeared to me to be too remote.
but perhaps i ought to do so.  you have never entertained in secret any
other proposal?â€™

â€˜father,â€™ she returned, almost scornfully, â€˜what other proposal can have
been made to _me_?  whom have i seen?  where have i been?  what are my
heartâ€™s experiences?â€™

â€˜my dear louisa,â€™ returned mr. gradgrind, reassured and satisfied.  â€˜you
correct me justly. 
 
 ___________________________
 
 i merely wished to discharge my duty.â€™

â€˜what do _i_ know, father,â€™ said louisa in her quiet manner, â€˜of tastes
and fancies; of aspirations and affections; of all that part of my nature
in which such light things might have been nourished?  what escape have i
had from problems that could be demonstrated, and realities that could be
grasped?â€™  as she said it, she unconsciously closed her hand, as if upon
a solid object, and slowly opened it as though she were releasing dust or
ash.

â€˜my dear,â€™ assented her eminently practical parent, â€˜quite true, quite
true.â€™

â

to ask _me_!  the
baby-preference that even i have heard of as common among children, has
never had its innocent resting-place in my breast.  you have been so
careful of me, that i never had a childâ€™s heart.  you have trained me so
well, that i never dreamed a childâ€™s dream.  you have dealt so wisely
with me, father, from my cradle to this hour, that i never had a childâ€™s
belief or a childâ€™s fear.â€™

mr. gradgrind was quite moved by his success, and by this testimony to
it.  â€˜my dear louisa,â€™ said he, â€˜you abundantly repay my care.  kiss me,
my dear girl.â€™

so, his daughter kissed him.  detaining her in his embrace, he said, â€˜i
may assure you now, my favourite child, that i am made happy by the sound
decision at which you have arrived.  mr. bounderby is a very remarkable
man; and what little disparity can be said to exist between youâ€”if anyâ€”is
more than counterbalanced by the tone your mind has acquired.  it has
always been my object so to educate you, as that you migh

kiss me once more, louisa.  now, let us go and find your mother.â€™

accordingly, they went down to the drawing-room, where the esteemed lady
with no nonsense about her, was recumbent as usual, while sissy worked
beside her.  she gave some feeble signs of returning animation when they
entered, and presently the faint transparency was presented in a sitting
attitude.

â€˜mrs. gradgrind,â€™ said her husband, who had waited for the achievement of
this feat with some impatience, â€˜allow me to present to you mrs.
bounderby.
 
 ___________________________
 
â€™

â€˜oh!â€™ said mrs. gradgrind, â€˜so you have settled it!  well, iâ€™m sure i
hope your health may be good, louisa; for if your head begins to split as
soon as you are married, which was the case with mine, i cannot consider
that you are to be envied, though i have no doubt you think you are, as
all girls do.  however, i give you joy, my dearâ€”and i hope you may now
turn all your ological studies to good account, i am sure i do!  i must
give you a kiss of congratulation, louisa; but donâ€™t touch my right
shoulder, for thereâ€™s something running down it all day long.  and now
you see,â€™ whimpered mrs. gradgrind, adjusting her shawls after the
affectionate ceremony, â€˜i shall be worrying myself, morning, noon, and
night, to know what i am to call him!â€™

â€˜mrs. gradgrind,â€™ said her husband, solemnly, â€˜what do you mean?â€™

â€˜whatever i am to call him, mr. gradgrind, when he is married to louisa!
i must call him something.  itâ€™s impossible,â€™ said mrs. grad

know.  am i to call my own son-in-law, mister!  not, i believe, unless
the time has arrived when, as an invalid, i am to be trampled upon by my
relations.  then, what am i to call him!â€™

nobody present having any suggestion to offer in the remarkable
emergency, mrs. gradgrind departed this life for the time being, after
delivering the following codicil to her remarks already executed:

â€˜as to the wedding, all i ask, louisa, is,â€”and i ask it with a fluttering

when mr. gradgrind had presented mrs. bounderby, sissy had suddenly
turned her head, and looked, in wonder, in pity, in sorrow, in doubt, in
a multitude of emotions, towards louisa.  louisa had known it, and seen
it, without looking at her.  from that moment she was impassive, proud

neither did the clocks go any faster, or any slower, than at other
seasons.  the deadly statistical recorder in the gradgrind observatory
knocked every second on the head as it was born, and buried it with his
accustomed regularity.

so the day came, as all other days come to people who will only stick to
reason; and when it came, there were married in the church of the florid
wooden legsâ€”that popular order of architectureâ€”josiah bounderby esquire
of coketown, to louisa eldest daughter of thomas gradgrind esquire of
stone lodge, m.p. for that borough.  and when they were united in holy
matrimony, they went home to breakfast at stone lodge aforesaid.

there was an improving party assembled on the auspicious occasion, who
knew what everything they had to eat and drink was made of, and how it
was imported or exported, and in what quantities, and in what bottoms,
whether native or foreign, and all about it.  the bridesmaids, down to
little jane gradgrind, were, in

coketown, and thatâ€™s enough for me.  however, though i am not influenced
by manners and station, loo bounderby may be.  she hadnâ€™t my
advantagesâ€”disadvantages you would call â€™em, but i call â€™em advantagesâ€”so
youâ€™ll not waste your power, i dare say.â€™

â€˜mr. bounderby,â€™ said jem, turning with a smile to louisa, â€˜is a noble
animal in a comparatively natural state, quite free from the harness in
which a conventional hack like myself works.â€™

â€˜you respect mr. bounderby very much,â€™ she quietly returned.  â€˜it is
natural that you should.â€™

he was disgracefully thrown out, for a gentleman who had seen so much of
the world, and thought, â€˜now, how am i to take this?â€™

â€˜you are going to devote yourself, as i gather from what mr. bounderby
has said, to the service of your country.  you have ma

difficulties.â€™

â€˜mrs. bounderby,â€™ he returned, laughing, â€˜upon my honour, no.  i will
make no such pretence to you.  i have seen a little, here and there, up
and down; i have found it all to be very worthless, as everybody has, and
as some confess they have, and some do not; and i am going

and may as well back them as anything else.â€™

â€˜have you none of your own?â€™ asked louisa.

â€˜i have not so much as the slightest predilection left.  i assure you i
attach not the least importance to any opinions.  the result of the
varieties of boredom i have undergone, is a conviction (unless conviction
is too industrious a word for the lazy sentiment i entertain on the
subject), that any set of ideas will do just as much good as any other
set, and just as much harm as any other set.  thereâ€™s an english family

as she pleased: â€˜the side that can prove anything in a line of units,
tens, hundreds, and thousands, mrs. bounderby, seems to me to afford the
most fun, and to give a man the best chance.  i am quite as much attached
to it as if i believed it.  i am quite ready to go in for it, to the same
extent as if i believed it.  and what more could i possibly do, if i did
believe it!â€™

â€˜you are a singular politician,â€™ said louisa.

â€˜pardon me; i have not even that merit.  we are the largest party in the
state, i assure you, mrs. bounderby, if we all fell out of our adopted
ranks and were reviewed together.â€™

mr. bounderby, who had been in danger of bursting in silence, interposed
here with a project for postponing the family dinner till half-past six,
and taking mr. james harthouse in the meantime on a round of visits to
the voting and interesting notabilities of coketown and its vicinity.

likewise entertained his guest over the soup and fish, with the
calculation that he (bounderby) had eaten in his youth at least three
horses under the guise of polonies and saveloys.  these recitals, jem, in
a languid manner, received with â€˜charming!â€™ every now and then; and they
probably would have decided him to â€˜go inâ€™ for jerusalem again to-morrow
morning, had he been less curious respecting louisa.

â€˜is there nothing,â€™ he thought, glancing at her as she sat at the head of
the table, where her youthful figure, small and slight, but very
graceful, looked as pretty as it looked misplaced; â€˜is there nothing that
will move that face?â€™

yes!  by jupiter, there was something, and here it was, in an unexpected
shape.  tom appeared.  she changed as the door opened, and broke into a
beaming smile.

country?â€™  and mr. bounderby pointed him out for inspection, with an
angry finger.

â€˜nay, maâ€™am,â€™ said stephen blackpool, staunchly protesting against the
words that had been used, and instinctively addressing himself to louisa,
after glancing at her face.  â€˜not rebels, nor yet rascals.  nowt oâ€™ thâ€™

â€˜how â€™tis, maâ€™am,â€™ resumed stephen, appearing still to find his natural
refuge in louisaâ€™s face, â€˜that what is best in us fok, seems to turn us

stephen raised his eyes quickly to his face.

â€˜you can finish off what youâ€™re at,â€™ said mr. bounderby, with a meaning
nod, â€˜and then go elsewhere.â€™

â€˜sir, yo know weel,â€™ said stephen expressively, â€˜that if i canna get work
wiâ€™ yo, i canna get it elsewheer.â€™

the reply was, â€˜what i know, i know; and what you know, you know.  i have
no more to say about it.â€™

stephen glanced at louisa again, but her eyes were raised to his no more;
therefore, with a sigh, and saying, barely above his breath, â€˜heaven help
us aw in this world!â€™ he departed.



chapter vi
fading away


it was falling dark when stephen came out of mr. bounderbyâ€™s house.  the
shadows of night had gathered so fast, that he did not look about him
when he closed the door, but plodded straight along the street.  nothing
was further from his thoughts than the curious old woman he had
encountered on his previous

ot fearfoâ€™ oâ€™ her.  yo was hey-go-mad
about her, but an hour sin.â€™

â€˜but are you sure itâ€™s the lady, and not the gentleman?â€™ she asked, still
trembling.

â€˜certain sure!â€™

â€˜well then, pray donâ€™t speak to me, nor yet take any notice of me,â€™ said
the old woman.  â€˜let me be quite to myself in this corner.â€™

stephen nodded; looking to rachael for an explanation, which she was
quite unable to give him; took the candle, went downstairs, and in a few
moments returned, lighting louisa into the room.  she was followed by the
whelp.

rachael had risen, and stood apart with her shawl and bonnet in her hand,
when stephen, himself profoundly astonished by this visit, put the candle
on the table.  then he too stood, with his doubled hand upon the table
near it, waiting to be addressed.

for the first time in her life louisa had come into one of the dwellings
of the coketown hands; for the first time in her life she was face to
face with anything like individuality in connection wi

into units, than of separating the sea itself into its
component drops.

she stood for some moments looking round the room.  from the few chairs,
the few books, the common prints, and the bed, she glanced to the two
women, and to stephen.

â€˜i have come to speak to you, in consequence of what passed just now.  i
should like to be serviceable to you, if you will let me.  is this your
wife?â€™

rachael raised her eyes, and they sufficiently answered no, and dropped
again.

â€˜i remember,â€™ said louisa, reddening at her mistake; â€˜i recollect, now,
to have heard your domestic misfortunes spoken of, though i was not
attending to the particulars at the time.  it was not my meaning to ask a
question that would give pain to any one here.  if i should ask any other
question that may happen to have that result, give me credit, if you
please, for being in ignorance how to speak to you as i ought.â€™

as stephen had but a little while ago instinctively addressed himself to
her, so she now instinctiv

€˜the chances are very small, young ladyâ€”next to nothingâ€”for a man who
gets a bad name among them.â€™

â€˜what shall i understand that you mean by a bad name?â€™

â€˜the name of being troublesome.â€™

â€˜then, by the prejudices of his own class, and by the prejudices of the
other, he is sacrificed alike?  are the two so deeply separated in this
town, that there is no place whatever for an honest workman between
them?â€™

rachael shook her head in silence.

â€˜he fell into suspicion,â€™ said louisa, â€˜with his fellow-weavers,
becauseâ€”he had made a promise not to be one of them.  i think it must
have been to you that he made that promise.  might i ask you why he made
it?â€™

rachael burst into tears.  â€˜i didnâ€™t seek it of him, poor lad.  i prayed
him to avoid trouble for his own good, little thinking heâ€™d come to it
through me.  but i know heâ€™d die a hundred deaths, ere ever heâ€™d break
his word.  i know that of him well.â€™

stephen had remained quietly attentive, in his usual

 thoughtful attitude,
with his hand at his chin.  he now spoke in a voice rather less steady
than usual.

â€˜no one, excepting myseln, can ever know what honour, anâ€™ what love, anâ€™
respect, i bear to rachael, or wiâ€™ what cause.  when i passed that
promess, i towd her true, she were thâ€™ angel oâ€™ my life.  â€™twere a solemn
promess.  â€™tis gone froâ€™ me, for ever.â€™

louisa turned her head to him, and bent it with a deference that was new
in her.  she looked from him to rachael, and her features softened.
â€˜what will you do?â€™ she asked him.  and her voice had softened too.

â€˜weel, maâ€™am,â€™ said stephen, making the best of it, with a smile; â€˜when i
ha finished off, i mun quit this part, and try another.  fortnet or
misfortnet, a man can but try; thereâ€™s nowt to be done wiâ€™out tryinâ€™â€”cept

â€˜how will you travel?â€™

louisa coloured, and a purse appeared in her hand.  the rustling of a
bank-note was audible, as she unfolded one and laid it on the table.

â€˜rachael, will you tell himâ€”for you know how, without offenceâ€”that this
is freely his, to help him on his way?  will you entreat him to take it?â€™

â€˜i canna do that, young lady,â€™ she answered, turning her head aside.
â€˜bless you for thinking oâ€™ the poor lad wiâ€™ such tenderness.  but â€™tis
for him to know his heart, and what is right according to i

louisa looked, in part incredulous, in part frightened, in part overcome
with quick sympathy, when this man of so much self-command, who had been
so plain and steady through the late interview, lost his composure in a
moment, and now stood with his hand before his face.  she stretched out
hers, as if she would have touched him; then checked herself, and
remained still.

â€˜not eâ€™en rachael,â€™ said stephen, when he stood again with his face
uncovered, â€˜could mak sitch a kind offerin, by onny words

 for his sake?  is that necessary?â€™

she seemed to try to answer, but nothing came of it.

â€˜candidly to confess everything that has occurred to me,â€™ said james
harthouse, again gliding with the same appearance of effort into his more
airy manner; â€˜i will confide to you my doubt whether he has had many
advantages.  whetherâ€”forgive my plainnessâ€”whether any great amount of
confidence is likely to have been established between himself and his
most worthy father.â€™

â€˜i do not,â€™ said louisa, flushing with her own great remembrance in that
wise, â€˜think it likely.â€™

â€˜or, between himself, andâ€”i may trust to your perfect understanding of my
meaning, i am sureâ€”and his highly esteemed brother-in-law.â€™

she flushed deeper and deeper, and was burning red when she replied in a
fainter voice, â€˜i do not think that likely, either.â€™

â€˜mrs. bounderby,â€™ said harthouse, after a short silence, â€˜may there be a
better confidence between yourself and me?  tom has borrowed a

as she sat looking straight before her, across the changing lights upon
the grass into the darkness of the wood beyond, he saw in her face her
application of his very distinctly uttered words.

â€˜all allowance,â€™ he continued, â€˜must be made.  i have one great fault to
find with tom, however, which i cannot forgive, and for which i take him
heavily to account.â€™

louisa turned her eyes to his face, and asked him what fault was that?

â€˜perhaps,â€™ he returned, â€˜i have said enough.  perhaps it would have been
better, on the whole, if no allusion to it had escaped me.â€™

â€˜you alarm me, mr. harthouse.  pray let me know it.â€™

â€˜to relieve you from needless apprehensionâ€”and as this confidence
regarding your brother, which i prize i am sure above all possible
things, has been established between usâ€”i obey.  i cannot forgive him for

â€˜not much of that, mr. harthouse, unless some fair creature with a
slashing fortune at her own disposal would take a fancy to me.  or she
might be as ugly as she was rich, without any fear of losing me.  iâ€™d
carve her name as often as she liked.â€™

â€˜i am afraid you are mercenary, tom.â€™

â€˜mercenary,â€™ repeated tom.  â€˜who is not mercenary?  ask my sister.â€™

â€˜have you so proved it to be a failing of mine, tom?â€™ said louisa,
showing no other sense of his discontent and ill-nature.

â€˜you know whether the cap fits you, loo,â€™ returned her brother sulkily.
â€˜if it does, you can wear it.â€™

â€˜tom is misanthropical to-day, as all bored people are now and then,â€™
said mr. harthouse.  â€˜donâ€™t believe him, mrs. bounderby.  he knows much
better.  i shall disclose some of his opinions of you, privately
expressed to me, unless he relents a little.â€™

â€˜at all events, mr. harthouse,â€™ said tom, softening in his a

his patron, but shaking his head sullenly too, â€˜you canâ€™t tell her that i
ever praised her for being mercenary.  i may have praised her for being
the contrary, and i should do it again, if i had as good reason.
however, never mind this now; itâ€™s not very interesting to you, and i am
sick of the subject.â€™

they walked on to the house, where louisa quitted her visitorâ€™s arm and
went in.  he stood looking after her, as she ascended the steps, and
passed into the shadow of the door; then put his hand upon her brotherâ€™s
shoulder again, and invited him with a confidential nod to a walk in the
garden.

â€˜tom, my fine fellow, i want to have a word with you.â€™

they had stopped among a disorder of rosesâ€”it was part of mr. bounderbyâ€™s
humility to keep nickitsâ€™s roses on a reduced scaleâ€”and tom sat down on a
terrace-parapet, plucking

oolâ€”that this condition was imposed upon him in mere careless good
nature to lessen his sense of obligation, â€˜we will tear ourselves asunder
until dinner-time.â€™

when tom appeared before dinner, though his mind seemed heavy enough, his
body was on the alert; and he appeared before mr. bounderby came in.  â€˜i
didnâ€™t mean to be cross, loo,â€™ he said, giving her his hand, and kissing
her.  â€˜i know you are fond of me, and you know i am fond of you.â€™

after this, there was a smile upon louisaâ€™s face that day, for some one
else.  alas, for some one else!

â€˜so much the less is the whelp the only creature that she cares for,â€™
thought james harthouse, reversing the reflection of his first dayâ€™s
knowledge of her pretty face.  â€˜so much the less, so much the less.â€™



chapter viii

the next morning was too bright a morning for sleep, and james harthouse
rose early, and sat in the pleasant bay window of his dressing-room,
smoking the rare tobacco that had had so whole

tained a greater
loss.â€™

â€˜thankâ€™ee,â€™ replied bounderby, in a short, ungracious manner.  â€˜but i
tell you what.  it might have been twenty thousand pound.â€™

â€˜i suppose it might.â€™

â€˜suppose it might!  by the lord, you _may_ suppose so.  by george!â€™ said
mr. bounderby, with sundry menacing nods and shakes of his head.  â€˜it
might have been twice twenty.  thereâ€™s no knowing what it would have
been, or wouldnâ€™t have been, as it was, but for the fellowsâ€™ being
disturbed.â€™

louisa had come up now, and mrs. sparsit, and bitzer.

â€˜hereâ€™s tom gradgrindâ€™s daughter knows pretty well what it might have
been, if you donâ€™t,â€™ blustered bounderby.  â€˜dropped, sir, as if she was
shot when i told her!  never knew her do such a thing before.  does her
credit, under the circumstances, in my opinion!â€™

she still looked faint and pale.  james harthouse begged her to take his
arm; and as they moved on very slowly, asked her how the robbery had been
committed.

â€˜why, i am g

now wait a bit.â€™  mr. bounderby wiped his head again.  â€˜what should you
say to;â€™ here he violently exploded: â€˜to a hand being in it?â€™

â€˜i hope,â€™ said harthouse, lazily, â€˜not our friend blackpot?â€™

â€˜say pool instead of pot, sir,â€™ returned bounderby, â€˜and thatâ€™s the man.â€™

louisa faintly uttered some word of incredulity and surprise.

â€˜o yes!  i know!â€™ said bounderby, immediately catching at the sound.  â€˜i
know!  i am used to that.  i know all about it.  they are the finest
people in the world, these fellows are.  they have got the gift of the
gab, they have.  they only want to have their rights explained to them,
they do.  but i tell you what.  show me a dissatisfied hand, and iâ€™ll

in the stable door after the horse is stolen; thereâ€™s an old woman turns
up now.  an old woman who seems to have been flying into town on a
broomstick, every now and then.  _she_ watches the place a whole day
before this fellow begins, and on the night when you saw him, she steals
away with him and holds a council with himâ€”i suppose, to make her report
on going off duty, and be damned to her.â€™

there was such a person in the room that night, and she shrunk from
observation, thought louisa.

â€˜this is not all of â€™em, even as we already know â€™em,â€™ said bounderby,
with many nods of hidden meaning.  â€˜but i have said enough for the
present.  youâ€™ll have the goodness to keep it quiet, and mention it to no
one.  it may take time, but we shall have â€™em.  itâ€™s policy to give â€™em

consequences, we should all go in for banks.â€™  he had gently taken
louisaâ€™s parasol from her hand, and had put it up for her; and she walked
under its shade, though the sun did not shine there.

â€˜for the present, loo bounderby,â€™ said her husband, â€˜hereâ€™s mrs. sparsit
to look after.  mrs. sparsitâ€™s nerves have been acted upon by this
business, and sheâ€™ll stay here a day or two.  so make her comfortable.â€™

â€˜thank you very much, sir,â€™ that discreet lady observed, â€˜but pray do not
let my comfort be a consideration.  anything will do for me.â€™

living under your roof.â€™  â€˜i havenâ€™t played backgammon, maâ€™am,â€™ said mr.
bounderby, â€˜since that time.â€™  â€˜no, sir,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, soothingly,
â€˜i am aware that you have not.  i remember that miss gradgrind takes no
interest in the game.  but i shall be happy, sir, if you will
condescend.â€™

they played near a window, opening on the garden.  it was a fine night:
not moonlight, but sultry and fragrant.  louisa and mr. harthouse
strolled out into the garden, where their voices could be heard in the
stillness, though not what they said.  mrs. sparsit, from her place at
the backgammon board, was constantly straining her eyes to pierce the
shadows without.  â€˜whatâ€™s the matter, maâ€™am?â€™ said mr. bounderby; â€˜you
donâ€™t see a fire, do you?â€™  â€˜oh dear no, sir,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit, â€˜i
was thinking of the dew.â€™  â€˜what have you got to do with the dew, maâ€™am?â€™
said mr. bounderby.  â€

˜it will do you good, sir.  it will warm your heart.  it is
the sort of thing you want, and ought to take, sir.â€™  and when mr.
bounderby said, â€˜your health, maâ€™am!â€™ she answered with great feeling,
â€˜thank you, sir.  the same to you, and happiness also.â€™  finally, she
wished him good night, with great pathos; and mr. bounderby went to bed,
with a maudlin persuasion that he had been crossed in something tender,
though he could not, for his life, have mentioned what it was.

long after louisa had undressed and lain down, she watched and waited for
her brotherâ€™s coming home.  that could hardly be, she knew, until an hour
past midnight; but in the country silence, which did anything but calm
the trouble of her thoughts, time lagged wearily.  at last, when the
darkness and stillness had seemed for hours to thicken one another, she
heard the bell at the gate.  she felt as though she would have been glad
that it rang on until daylight; but it ceased, and the circles of its
last sound s

 said with
forced lightness of heart, â€˜you want your breakfast, sir, but i dare say
miss gradgrind will soon be here to preside at the table,â€™ mr. bounderby
replied, â€˜if i waited to be taken care of by my wife, maâ€™am, i believe
you know pretty well i should wait till doomsday, so iâ€™ll trouble _you_
to take charge of the teapot.â€™  mrs. sparsit complied, and assumed her
old position at table.

this again made the excellent woman vastly sentimental.  she was so
humble withal, that when louisa appeared, she rose, protesting she never
could think of sitting in that place under existing circumstances, often
as she had had the honour of making mr. bounderbyâ€™s breakfast, before
mrs. gradgrindâ€”she begged pardon, she meant to say miss bounderbyâ€”she
hoped to be excused, but she really could not get it right yet, though
she trusted to become familiar with it by and byâ€”had assumed her present
position.  it was only (she observed) because miss gradgrind happened to
be a little late, an

â€˜of course.  it is of no moment.  why should it be of any importance to
me?â€™

â€˜why should it be of any importance to any one, mrs. sparsit, maâ€™am?â€™
said mr. bounderby, swelling with a sense of slight.  â€˜you attach too
much importance to these things, maâ€™am.  by george, youâ€™ll be corrupted
in some of your notions here.  you are old-fashioned, maâ€™am.  you are
behind tom gradgrindâ€™s childrenâ€™s time.â€™

â€˜what is the matter with you?â€™ asked louisa, coldly surprised.  â€˜what has
given you offence?â€™

â€˜offence!â€™ repeated bounderby.  â€˜do you suppose if there was any offence
given me, i shouldnâ€™t name it, and request to have it corrected?  i am a
straightforward man, i believe.  i donâ€™t go beating about for
side-winds.â€™

â€˜have?â€™ returned mr. bounderby.  â€˜nothing.  otherwise, donâ€™t you, loo
bounderby, know thoroughly well that i, josiah bounderby of coketown,
would have it?â€™

she looked at him, as he struck the table and made the teacups ring, with
a proud colour in her face that was a new change, mr. harthouse thought.
â€˜you are incomprehensible this morning,â€™ said louisa.  â€˜pray take no
further trouble to explain yourself.  i am not curious to know your
meaning.  what does it matter?â€™

nothing more was said on this theme, and mr. harthouse was soon idly gay
on indifferent subjects.  but from this day, the sparsit action upon mr.
bounderby threw louisa and james harthouse more together, and
strengthened the dangerous alienation from her husband and confidence
against him with another, into which she had fallen by degrees so fine

of it.â€™

mr. bounderby had not been long gone, when bitzer appeared.  bitzer had
come down by train, shrieking and rattling over the long line of arches
that bestrode the wild country of past and present coal-pits, with an
express from stone lodge.  it was a hasty note to inform louisa that mrs.
gradgrind lay very ill.  she had never been well within her daughterâ€™s
knowledge; but, she had declined within the last few days, had continued
sinking all through the night, and was now as nearly dead, as her limited
capacity of being in any state that implied the ghost of an intention to
get out of it, allowed.

accompanied by the lightest of porters, fit colourless servitor at
deathâ€™s door when mrs. gradgrind knocked, louisa rumbled to coketown,

she dismissed the messenger to his own devices, and rode away to her old
home.

she had seldom been there since her marriage.  her father was usually
sifting and sifting at his parliamentary cinder-heap in london (without
being observed to turn up many precious articles among the rubbish), and
was still hard at it in the national dust-yard.  her mother had taken it
rather as a disturbance than otherwise, to be visited, as she reclined
upon her sofa; young people, louisa felt herself all unfit for; sissy she
had never softened to again, since the night when the strollerâ€™s child
had raised her eyes to look at mr. bounderbyâ€™s intended wife.  she had no
inducements to go back, and had rarely gone.

neither, as she approached her old home now, did any of the best
influences of old home descend upon her.  the dreams of childhoodâ€”its
airy fables; its graceful, beautiful, humane, impossible adornments of
the world beyond: so good to be believed in once, so good

her feeble voice sounded so far away in her bundle of shawls, and the
sound of another voice addressing her seemed to take such a long time in
getting down to her ears, that she might have been lying at the bottom of
a well.  the poor lady was nearer truth than she ever had been: which had
much to do with it.

on being told that mrs. bounderby was there, she replied, at
cross-purposes, that she had never called him by that name since he
married louisa; that pending her choice of an objectionable name, she had
called him j; and that she could not at present depart from that
regulation, not being yet provided with a permanent substitute.  louisa
had sat by her for some minutes, and had spoken to her often, before she
arrived at a clear understanding who it was.  she then seemed to come to
it all at once.

â€˜well, my dear,â€™ said mrs. gradgrind, â€˜and i hope you are going on
satisfactorily to yourself.  it was all your fatherâ€™s doing.  he

â€˜i want to hear of you, mother; not of myself.â€™

â€˜you want to hear of me, my dear?  thatâ€™s something new, i am sure, when
anybody wants to hear of me.  not at all well, louisa.  very faint and
giddy.â€™

â€˜are you in pain, dear mother?â€™

â€˜i think thereâ€™s a pain somewhere in the room,â€™ said mrs. gradgrind, â€˜but
i couldnâ€™t positively say that i have got it.â€™

after this strange speech, she lay silent for some time.  louisa, holding
her hand, could feel no pulse; but kissing it, could see a slight thin
thread of life in fluttering motion.

â€˜you very seldom see your sister,â€™ said mrs. gradgrind.  â€˜she grows like
you.  i wish you would look at her.  sissy, bring her here.â€™

she was brought, and stood with her hand in her sisterâ€™s.  louisa had
observed her with her arm round sissyâ€™s neck, and she felt the difference
of this approach.

â€˜do you see the likeness, louisa?â€™

â€˜yes, mother.  i should think

sissy, my good girl, leave us alone a minute.â€™ louisa had relinquished
the hand: had thought that her sisterâ€™s was a better and brighter face
than hers had ever been: had seen in it, not without a rising feeling of
resentment, even in that place and at that time, something of the
gentleness of the other face in the room; the sweet face with the
trusting eyes, made paler than watching and sympathy made it, by the rich
dark hair.

left alone with her mother, louisa saw her lying with an awful lull upon
her face, like one who was floating away upon

long left off saying anything.â€™

â€˜i can hear you, mother.â€™  but, it was only by dint of bending down to
her ear, and at the same time attentively watching the lips as they
moved, that she could link such faint and broken sounds into any chain of
connexion.

â€˜you learnt a great deal, louisa, and so did your brother.  ologies of

her from floating away.

 this recess from the guardianship
of the bank, mrs. sparsit was a pattern of consistency; continuing to
take such pity on mr. bounderby to his face, as is rarely taken on man,
and to call his portrait a noodle to _its_ face, with the greatest
acrimony and contempt.

mr. bounderby, having got it into his explosive composition that mrs.
sparsit was a highly superior woman to perceive that he had that general
cross upon him in his deserts (for he had not yet settled what it was),
and further that louisa would have objected to her as a frequent visitor
if it had comported with his greatness that she should object to anything
he chose to do, resolved not to lose sight of mrs. sparsit easily.  so
when her nerves were strung up to the pitch of again consuming
sweetbreads in solitude, he said to her at the dinner-table, on the day
before her departure, â€˜i tell you what, maâ€™am; you shall come down here
of a saturday, while the fine weather lasts, and stay till monday.â€™  to
which mrs. sparsit r

eturned, in effect, though not of the mahomedan
persuasion: â€˜to hear is to obey.â€™

now, mrs. sparsit was not a poetical woman; but she took an idea in the
nature of an allegorical fancy, into her head.  much watching of louisa,
and much consequent observation of her impenetrable demeanour, which
keenly whetted and sharpened mrs. sparsitâ€™s edge, must have given her as
it were a lift, in the way of inspiration.  she erected in her mind a
mighty staircase, with a dark pit of shame and ruin at the bottom; and
down those stairs, from day to day and hour to hour, she saw louisa
coming.

it became the business of mrs. sparsitâ€™s life, to look up at her
staircase, and to watch louisa coming down.  sometimes slowly, someti

â€˜the old woman i mentioned, maâ€™am,â€™ said bounderby, cutting the matter
short, as it was nothing to boast about, â€˜is not laid hold of; but, she
may take her oath she will be, if that is any satisfaction to her
villainous old mind.  in the mean time, maâ€™am, i am of opinion, if you
ask me my opinion, that the less she is talked about, the better.â€™

the same evening, mrs. sparsit, in her chamber window, resting from her
packing operations, looked towards her great staircase and saw louisa
still descending.

she sat by mr. harthouse, in an alcove in the garden, talking very low;
he stood leaning over her, as they whispered together, and his face
almost touched her hair.  â€˜if not quite!â€™ said mrs. sparsit, straining
her hawkâ€™s eyes to the utmost.  mrs. sparsit was too distant to hear a
word of their discourse, or even to know that they were speaking softly,
otherwise than from the expression of their figures; but what they said
was this:

humble-virtue school of eloquence; but, i assure you i thought at the
time, â€œmy good fellow, you are over-doing this!â€â€™

â€˜no, certainly.â€™

â€˜nor of any other such person?â€™

had lately seen, â€˜when i know nothing of them, men or women?â€™

sitting thoughtful awhile, â€˜to be so ready to agree with you, and to be
so lightened in my heart by what you say.â€™

night and day, mrs. sparsit kept it standing.  when louisa had arrived at
the bottom and disappeared in the gulf, it might fall in upon her if it
would; but, until then, there it was to be, a building, before mrs.
sparsitâ€™s eyes.  and there louisa always was, upon it.

and always gliding down, down, down!

mrs. sparsit saw james harthouse come and go; she heard of him here and
there; she saw the changes of the face he had studied; she, too, remarked
to a nicety how and when it clouded, how and when it cleared; she kept
her black eyes wide open, with no touch of pity, with no touch of
compunction, all absorbed in interest.  in the interest of seeing her,

promptitude to the national cinder-heap, and resumed his sifting for the
odds and ends he wanted, and his throwing of the dust about into the eyes
of other people who wanted other odds and endsâ€”in fact resumed his
parliamentary duties.

in the meantime, mrs. sparsit kept unwinking watch and ward.  separated
from her staircase, all the week, by the length of iron road dividing
coketown from the country house, she yet maintained her cat-like
observation of louisa, through her husband, through her brother, through
james harthouse, through the outsides of letters and packets, through
everything animate and inanimate that at any time went near the stairs.

her hands rested in one another, like the hands of a statue; and even her
manner of speaking was not hurried.

â€˜my dear child,â€™ said harthouse; mrs. sparsit saw with delight that his
arm embraced her; â€˜will you not bear with my society for a little while?â€™

â€˜not here.â€™

â€˜where, louisa?

â€˜not here.â€™

â€˜but we have so little time to make so much of, and i have come so far,
and am altogether so devoted, and distracted.  there never was a slave at
once so devoted and ill-used by his mistress.  to look for your sunny
welcome that has warmed me into life, and to be received in your frozen
manner, is heart-rending.â€™

dearest louisa, i cannot go myself, or let you go, in this hard abuse of
your power.â€™

mrs. sparsit saw him detain her with his encircling arm, and heard him
then and there, within her (mrs. sparsitâ€™s) greedy hearing, tell her how
he loved her, and how she was the stake for which he ardently desired to
play away all that he had in life.  the objects he had lately pursued,
turned worthless beside her; such success as was almost in his grasp, he
flung away from him like the dirt it was, compared with her.

ed you are!â€™

mrs. sparsit saw her out of the wood, and saw her enter the house.  what
to do next?  it rained now, in a sheet of water.  mrs. sparsitâ€™s white
stockings were of many colours, green predominating; prickly things were
in her shoes; caterpillars slung themselves, in hammocks of their own
making, from various parts of her dress; rills ran from her bonnet, and
her roman nose.  in such condition, mrs. sparsit stood hidden in the
density of the shrubbery, considering what next?

lo, louisa coming out of the house!  hastily cloaked and muffled, and
stealing away.  she elopes!  she falls from the lowermost stair, and is
swallowed up in the gulf.

indifferent to the rain, and moving with a quick determined step, she
struck into a side-path parallel with the ride.  mrs. sparsit followed in
the shadow of the trees, at but a short distance; for it was not easy to
keep a figure in view going quickly through the umbrageous darkness.

when she stopped to close the side-gate without noise,

coketown would come through presently, mrs. sparsit knew; so she
understood coketown to be her first place of destination.

in mrs. sparsitâ€™s limp and streaming state, no extensive precautions were
necessary to change her usual appearance; but, she stopped under the lee
of the station wall, tumbled her shawl into a new shape, and put it on
over her bonnet.  so disguised she had no fear of being recognized when
she followed up the railroad steps, and paid her money in the small
office.  louisa sat waiting in a corner.  mrs. sparsit sat waiting in
another corner.  both listened to the thunder, which was loud, and to the
rain, as it washed off the roof, and pattered on the parapets of the
arches.  two or three lamps were rained out and blown out; so, both saw
the lightning to advantage as it quivered and zigzagged on the iron
tracks.

to a complaint of the heart, announced the train.  fire and steam, and

into one carriage, mrs. sparsit put into another: the little station a
desert speck in the thunderstorm.

though her teeth chattered in her head from wet and cold, mrs. sparsit
exulted hugely.  the figure had plunged down the precipice, and she felt
herself, as it were, attending on the body.  could she, who had been so
active in the getting up of the funeral triumph, do less than exult?

at its destination.  gutters and pipes had burst, drains had overflowed,
and streets were under water.  in the first instant of alighting, mrs.
sparsit turned her distracted eyes towards the waiting coaches, which
were in great request.  â€˜she will get into one,â€™ she considered, â€˜and
will be away before i can follow in another.  at all risks of being run
over, i must see the number, and hear the order given to the coachman.â€™

but, mrs. sparsit was wrong in her calculation.  louisa got into no
coach, and was already gone.  the black eyes kept upon the
railroad-carriage in which she had travelled, settled upon it a moment
too late.  the door not being opened after several minutes, mrs. sparsit

attracted his attention sufficiently to make him raise his head
sometimes, as if he were rather remonstrating with the elements.  when it
thundered very loudly, he glanced towards coketown, having it in his mind
that some of the tall chimneys might be struck by lightning.

the thunder was rolling into distance, and the rain was pouring down like
a deluge, when the door of his room opened.  he looked round the lamp
upon his table, and saw, with amazement, his eldest daughter.

â€˜louisa!â€™

â€˜father, i want to speak to you.â€™

â€˜what is the matter?  how strange you look!  and good heaven,â€™ said mr.
gradgrind, wondering more and more, â€˜have you come here exposed to this
storm?â€™

she put her hands to her dress, as if she hardly knew.  â€˜yes.â€™  then she
uncovered her head, and letting her cloak and hood fall where they might,
stood looking at him: so colourless, so dishevelled, so defiant and
despairing, that he was afraid of her.

â€˜what is it?  i conjure you, loui

she dropped into a chair before him, and put her cold hand on his arm.

â€˜father, you have trained me from my cradle?â€™

â€˜yes, louisa.â€™

â€˜i curse the hour in which i was born to such a destiny.â€™

he looked at her in doubt and dread, vacantly repeating: â€˜curse the hour?
curse the hour?â€™

â€˜how could you give me life, and take from me all the inappreciable
things that raise it from the state of conscious death?  where are the
graces of my soul?  where are the sentiments of my heart?  what have you
done, o father, what have you done, with the garden that should have
bloomed once, in this great wilderness here!â€™

â€˜if it had ever been here, its ashes alone would save me from the void in
which my whole life sinks.  i did not mean to say this; but, father, you
remember the last time we conversed in this room?â€™

he had been so wholly unprepared for what he heard now, that it was with
difficulty he answered, â€˜yes, louisa.â€™

â€˜what has risen to my lips now, would have risen to my lips then, if you
had given me a momentâ€™s help.  i donâ€™t reproach you, father.  what you
have never nurtured in me, you have never nurtured in yourself; but o! if
you had only done so long ago, or if you had only neglected me, what a
much better and much happier creature i should have been this day!â€™

on hearing this, after all his care, he bowed his head upon his hand and
groaned aloud.

from what is sordid and bad in the real things around me, my school in
which i should have learned to be more humble and more trusting with
them, and to hope in my little sphere to make them better?â€™

â€˜o no, no.  no, louisa.â€™

â€˜yet, father, if i had been stone blind; if i had groped my way by my
sense of touch, and had been free, while i knew the shapes and surfaces
of things, to exercise my fancy somewhat, in regard to them; i should
have been a million times wiser, happier, more loving, more contented,
more innocent and human in all good respects, than i am with the eyes i

stood close together:

doubting, misbelieving, despising, regretting, what i have not learned;
and my dismal resource has been to think that life would soon go by, and
that nothing in it could be worth the pain and trouble of a contest.â€™

â€˜and i so young.  in this condition, fatherâ€”for i show you now, without
fear or favour, the ordinary deadened state of my mind as i know itâ€”you
proposed my husband to me.  i took him.  i never made a pretence to him
or you that i loved him.  i knew, and, father, you knew, and he knew,

her father might instinctively have loosened his hold, but that he felt
her strength departing from her, and saw a wild dilating fire in the eyes
steadfastly regarding him.

â€˜i say nothing of his plea for claiming my confidence.  it matters very
little how he gained it.  father, he did gain it.  what you know of the
story of my marriage, he soon knew, just as well.â€™

he tightened his hold in time to prevent her sinking on the floor, but
she cried out in a terrible voice, â€˜i shall die if you hold me!  let me

his heart and the triumph of his system, lying, an insensible heap, at
his feet.

louisa awoke from a torpor, and her eyes languidly opened on her old bed
at home, and her old room.  it seemed, at first, as if all that had
happened since the days when these objects were familiar to her were the
shadows of a dream, but gradually, as the objects became more real to her
sight, the events became more real to her mind.

she could scarcely move her head for pain and heaviness, her eyes were
strained and sore, and she was very weak.  a curious passive inattention

room did not attract her notice for some time.  even when their eyes had
met, and her sister had approached the bed, louisa lay for minutes
looking at her in silence, and suffering her timidly to hold her passive
hand, before she asked:

â€˜when was i brought to this room?â€™

â€˜last night, louisa.â€™

â€˜who brought me here?â€™

â€˜sissy, i believe.â€™

â€˜why do you believe so?â€™

â€˜because i found her here this morning.  she didnâ€™t come to my bedside to
wake me, as she always does; and i went to look for her.  she was not in
her own room either; and i went looking for her all over the house, until
i found her here taking care of you and cooling your head.  will you see
father? sissy said i was to tell him when you woke.â€™

â€˜what a beaming face you have, jane!â€™ said louisa, as

â€˜have i?  i am very glad you think so.  i am sure it must be sissyâ€™s

the arm louisa had begun to twine around her neck, unbent itself.  â€˜you
can tell father if you will.â€™  then, staying her for a moment, she said,
â€˜it was you who made my room so cheerful, and gave it this look of
welcome?â€™

â€˜oh no, louisa, it was done before i came.  it wasâ€”â€™

louisa turned upon her pillow, and heard no more.  when her sister had
withdrawn, she turned her head back again, and lay with her face towards
the door, until it opened and her father entered.

he had a jaded anxious look upon him, and his hand, usually steady,
trembled in hers.  he sat down at the side of the bed, tenderly asking
how she was, and dwelling on the necessity of her keeping very quiet
after her agitation and exposure to the weather last night.  he spoke in
a subdued and troubled voice,

very different from his usual dictatorial
manner; and was often at a loss for words.

â€˜my dear louisa.  my poor daughter.â€™  he was so much at a loss at that
place, that he stopped altogether.  he tried again.

â€˜my unfortunate child.â€™  the place was so difficult to get over, that he
tried again.

â€˜it would be hopeless for me, louisa, to endeavour to tell you how
overwhelmed i have been, and still am, by what broke upon me last night.
the ground on which i stand has ceased to be solid under my feet.  the
only support on which i leaned, and the strength of which it seemed, and
still does seem, impossible to question, has given way in an instant.  i
am stunned by these discoveries.  i have no selfish meaning in what i
say; but i find the shock of what broke upon me last night, to be very
heavy indeed.â€™

whole life upon the rock.

â€˜i will not say, louisa, that if you had by any happy chance undeceived
me some time ago, it would have been better for us both; better for your
peace, and better for mine.  for i am sensible that it may not have been
a part of my system to invite any confidence of that kind.  i had proved
myâ€”my system to myself, and i have rigidly administered it; and i must
bear the responsibility of its failures.  i only entreat you to believe,
my favourite child, that i have meant to do right.â€™

he said it earnestly, and to do

he might have added more than all, when he saw the face now looking at
him.  he did add it in effect, perhaps, as he softly moved her scattered
hair from her forehead with his hand.  such little actions, slight in
another man, were very noticeable in him; and his daughter received them
as if they had been words of contrition.

â€˜but,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, slowly, and with hesitation, as well as with a
wretched sense of happiness, â€˜if i see reason to mistrust myself for the
past, louisa, i should also mistrust myself for the present and the
future.  to speak unreservedly to you, i do.  i am far from feeling
convinced now, however differently i might have felt only this time
yesterday, that i am fit for the trust you repose in me; that i know how
to respond to the appeal you have come home to make to me; that i have
the right instinctâ€”supposing it for the moment to be some quality of that
natureâ€”how to help you, and to set you right, my child.â€™

she had turned upon her pi

in the respect that he would have been glad to see her
in tears.

â€˜some persons hold,â€™ he pursued, still hesitating, â€˜that there is a
wisdom of the head, and that there is a wisdom of the heart.  i have not
supposed so; but, as i have said, i mistrust myself now.  i have supposed
the head to be all-sufficient.  it may not be all-sufficient; how can i
venture this morning to say it is!  if that other kind of wisdom should
be what i have neglected, and should be the instinct that is wanted,
louisaâ€”â€™

he suggested it very doubtfully, as if he were half unwilling to admit it
even now.  she made him no answer, lying before him on her bed, still
half-dressed, much as he had seen her lying on the floor of his room last
night.

â€˜louisa,â€™ and his hand rested on her hair again, â€˜i have been absent from
here, my dear, a good deal of late; and though your sisterâ€™s training has
been pursued according toâ€”the system,â€™ he appeared to come to that word
with great reluctance always, â€˜i

r,â€™ she replied, without stirring, â€˜if any harmony has been
awakened in her young breast that was mute in mine until it turned to
discord, let her thank heaven for it, and go upon her happier way, taking
it as her greatest blessing that she has avoided my way.â€™

â€˜o my child, my child!â€™ he said, in a forlorn manner, â€˜i am an unhappy
man to see you thus!  what avails it to me that you do not reproach me,
if i so bitterly reproach myself!â€™  he bent his head, and spoke low to
her.  â€˜louisa, i have a misgiving that some change may have been slowly
working about me in this house, by mere love and gratitude: that what the
head had left undone and could not do, the heart may have been doing
silently.  can it be so?â€™

she made him no reply.

â€˜i am not too proud to believe it, louisa.  how could i be arrogant, and
you before me!  can it be so?  is it so, my dear?â€™  he looked upon her
once more, lying cast away there; and without another word went out of
the room.  he had not been

it lay there, warming into life a crowd of gentler thoughts; and she
rested.  as she softened with the quiet, and the consciousness of being
so watched, some tears made their way into her eyes.  the face touched
hers, and she knew that there were tears upon it too, and she the cause
of them.

as louisa feigned to rouse herself, and sat up, sissy retired, so that
she stood placidly near the bedside.

â€˜i hope i have not disturbed you.  i have come to ask if you would let me
stay with you?â€™

â€˜why should you stay with me?  my sister will miss you.  you are
everything to her.â€™

â€˜am i?â€™ returned sissy, shaking her head.  â€˜i would be something to you,
if i might.â€™

â€˜what?â€™ said louisa, almost sternly.

â€˜whatever you want most, if i could be that.  at all events, i would like
to

will never tire of trying.  will you let me?â€™

â€˜my father sent you to ask me.â€™

â€˜no indeed,â€™ replied sissy.  â€˜he told me that i might come in now, but he
sent me away from the room this morningâ€”or at leastâ€”â€™

she hesitated and stopped.

â€˜at least, what?â€™ said louisa, with her searching eyes upon her.

â€˜i thought it best myself that i should be sent away, for i felt very
uncertain whether you would like to find me here.â€™

â€˜have i always hated you so much?â€™

â€˜i hope not, for i have always loved you, and have always wished that you
should know it.  but you changed to me a little, shortly before you left
home.  not that i wondered at it.  you knew so much, and i knew so
little, and it was so natural in many ways, going as you were among other

, that i had nothing to complain of, and was not at all hurt.â€™

her colour rose as she said it modestly and hurriedly.  louisa understood
the loving pretence, and her heart smote her.

â€˜may i try?â€™ said sissy, emboldened to raise her hand to the neck that
was insensibly drooping towards her.

louisa, taking down the hand that would have embraced her in another
moment, held it in one of hers, and answered:

â€˜first, sissy, do you know what i am?  i am so proud and so hardened, so
confused and troubled, so resentful and unjust to every one and to
myself, that everything is stormy, dark, and wicked to me.  does not that
repel you?â€™

â€˜no!â€™

â€˜i am so unhappy, and all that should have made me otherwise is so laid
waste, that if i had been bereft of sense to this hour, and instead of

â€˜no!â€™

in the innocence of her brave affection, and the brimming up of her old
devoted spirit, the once deserted girl shone like a beautiful light upon
the darkness of the other.

louisa raised the hand that it might clasp her neck and join its fellow
there.  she fell upon her knees, and clinging to this strollerâ€™s child
looked up at her almost with veneration.

â€˜forgive me, pity me, help me!  have compassion on my great need, and let
me lay this head of mine upon a loving heart!â€™

â€˜o lay it here!â€™ cried sissy.  â€˜lay it here, my dear.â€™

â€˜you have missed my letter!â€™ exclaimed mr. gradgrind, surprised by the
apparition.

â€˜missed your letter, sir!â€™ bawled bounderby.  â€˜the present time is no
time for letters.  no man shall talk to josiah bounderby of coketown
about letters, with his mind in the state itâ€™s in now.â€™

â€˜bounderby,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, in a tone of temperate remonstrance, â€˜i
speak of a very special letter i have written to you, in reference to
louisa.â€™

â€˜tom gradgrind,â€™ replied bounderby, knocking the flat of his hand several
times with great vehemence on the table, â€˜i speak of a very special
messenger that has come to me, in reference to louisa.  mrs. sparsit,
maâ€™am, stand forward!â€™

so aggravating and underwent so many facial contortions, that mr.

â€˜it is not necessary to repeat its tenor, bounderby.  i know what
passed.â€™

â€˜you do?  perhaps,â€™ said bounderby, staring with all his might at his so
quiet and assuasive father-in-law, â€˜you know where your daughter is at
the present time!â€™

â€˜undoubtedly.  she is here.â€™

â€˜here?â€™

â€˜my dear bounderby, let me beg you to restrain these loud out-breaks, on
all accounts.  louisa is here.  the moment she could detach herself from
that interview with the person of whom you speak, and whom i deeply
regret to have been the means of introducing to you, louisa hurried here,
for protection.  i myself had not been at home many hours, when i
received herâ€”here, in this room.  she hurried by the train to town, she
ran from town to this house, through a raging storm, and presented
herself before me in a state of distraction.  of course, she has remained
here ever since.  let me

â€˜i never mentioned his name!â€™ said bounderby.

â€˜well, well!â€™ returned mr. gradgrind, with a patient, even a submissive,
air.  and he sat for a little while pondering.  â€˜bounderby, i see reason
to doubt whether we have ever quite understood louisa.â€™

â€˜who do you mean by we?â€™

â€˜let me say i, then,â€™ he returned, in answer to the coarsely blurted
question; â€˜i doubt whether i have understood louisa.  i doubt whether i

â€˜and therefore i wonâ€™t make any promises.â€™

â€˜in the course of a few hours, my dear bounderby,â€™ mr. gradgrind
proceeded, in the same depressed and propitiatory manner, â€˜i appear to
myself to have become better informed as to louisaâ€™s character, than in
previous years.  the enlightenment has been painfully forced upon me, and
the discovery is not mine.  i think there areâ€”bounderby, you will be
surprised to hear me say thisâ€”i think there are qualities in louisa,
whichâ€”which have been harshly neglected, andâ€”and a little perverted.

the blustrous bounderby crimsoned and swelled to such an extent on
hearing these words, that he seemed to be, and probably was, on the brink
of a fit.  with his very ears a bright purple shot with crimson, he pent
up his indignation, however, and said:

â€˜youâ€™d like to keep her here for a time?â€™

â€˜iâ€”i had intended to recommend, my dear bounderby, that you should allow

â€˜i gather from all this, tom gradgrind,â€™ said bounderby, standing up with
his hands in his pockets, â€˜that you are of opinion that thereâ€™s what
people call some incompatibility between loo bounderby and myself.â€™

â€˜i fear there is at present a general incompatibility between louisa,
andâ€”andâ€”and almost all the relations in which i have placed her,â€™ was her
fatherâ€™s sorrowful reply.

â€˜now, look you here, tom gradgrind,â€™ said bounderby the flushed,
confronting him with his legs wide apart, his hands deeper in his
pockets, and his hair like a hayfield wherein his windy anger was
boisterous.  â€˜you have said your say; i am going to say mine.  i am a

question that may shorten the business.  what do you mean by the proposal
you made just now?â€™

â€˜what do i mean, bounderby?â€™

â€˜by your visiting proposition,â€™ said bounderby, with an inflexible jerk
of the hayfield.

â€˜i mean that i hope you may be induced to arrange in a friendly manner,
for allowing louisa a period of repose and reflection here, which may
tend to a gradual alteration for the better in many respects.â€™

bounderby.

â€˜what made you think of this?â€™ said bounderby.

my look out.â€™

â€˜i was merely going on to remark, bounderby, that we may all be more or
less in the wrong, not even excepting you; and that some yielding on your
part, remembering the trust you have accepted, may not only be an act of
true kindness, but perhaps a debt incurred towards louisa.â€™

â€˜i think differently,â€™ blustered bounderby.  â€˜i am going to finish this
business according to my own opinions.  now, i donâ€™t want to make a

think it would be worthy of my reputation to quarrel on such a subject.

army; the general assemblage subscribed to the gospel according to
slackbridge, and gave three cheers for him, as he sat demonstratively
panting at them.

these men and women were yet in the streets, passing quietly to their
homes, when sissy, who had been called away from louisa some minutes
before, returned.

â€˜who is it?â€™ asked louisa.

â€˜it is mr. bounderby,â€™ said sissy, timid of the name, â€˜and your brother
mr. tom, and a young woman who says her name is rachael, and that you
know her.â€™

â€˜what do they want, sissy dear?â€™

â€˜they want to see you.  rachael has been crying, and seems angry.â€™

for a reason that will explain itself.  shall they come in here?â€™

woman who has been making statements which render my visit necessary.
tom gradgrind, as your son, young tom, refuses for some obstinate reason
or other to say anything at all about those statements, good or bad, i am
obliged to confront her with your daughter.â€™

â€˜once before.â€™

tom coughed again.

â€˜i have.â€™

rachael cast her eyes proudly towards mr. bounderby, and said, â€˜will you
make it known, young lady, where, and who was there?â€™

wellâ€”and so fullâ€”that what business had i to take it out of her mouth!â€™

failed her, and she broke off sobbing.

â€˜he hadnâ€™t been gone from here, young lady,â€™ said rachael, turning
appealingly to louisa, â€˜as much as a week, when he sent me the only

tom came out of his corner when mr. bounderby moved, moved with him, kept
close to him, and went away with him.  the only parting salutation of
which he delivered himself was a sulky â€˜good night, father!â€™  with a
brief speech, and a scowl at his sister, he left the house.

since his sheet-anchor had come home, mr. gradgrind had been sparing of
speech.  he still sat silent, when louisa mildly said:

â€˜rachael, you will not distrust me one day, when you know me better.â€™

â€˜it goes against me,â€™ rachael answered, in a gentler manner, â€˜to mistrust
any one; but when i am so mistrustedâ€”when we all areâ€”i cannot keep such
things quite out of my mind.  i ask your pardon for having done you an
injury.  i donâ€™t think what i said now.  yet i might come to think it
again, wiâ€™ the poor lad so wronged.â€™

sissy had already been at her side asking her where she lived, and
whether she might come to-morrow night, to inquire if there were news of
him.

â€˜i doubt,â€™ said rachael, â€˜if he can be here till next day.â€™

â€˜then i will come next night too,â€™ said sissy.

when rachael, assenting to this, was gone, mr. gradgrind lifted up his
head, and said to his daughter:

â€˜louisa, my dear, i have never, that i know of, seen this man.  do you
believe him to be implicated?â€™

â€˜i think i have believed it, father, though with great difficulty.  i do
not believe it now.â€™

him to be suspected.  his appearance and manner; are they so honest?â€™

who is he?â€™

his hair had latterly began to change its colour.  as he leaned upon his
hand again, looking gray and old, louisa, with a face of fear and pity,
hurriedly went over to him, and sat close at his side.  her eyes by
accident met sissyâ€™s at the moment.  sissy flushed and started, and
louisa put her finger on her lip.

next night, when sissy returned home and told louisa that stephen was not
come, she told it in a whisper.  next night again, when she came home
with the same account, and added that he had not been heard of, she spoke
in the same low frightened tone.  from the moment of that interchange of
looks, they never uttered his name, or any reference to him, aloud; nor
ever pursued the subject of the robbery, when mr. gradgrind spoke of it.

the two appointed days ran out, three days and nights ran out, and

went home: that is to say on the night when he still stuck close to
bounderby, as already related.

there was one dim unformed fear lingering about his sisterâ€™s mind, to
which she never gave utterance, which surrounded the graceless and
ungrateful boy with a dreadful mystery.  the same dark possibility had
presented itself in the same shapeless guise, this very day, to sissy,
when rachael spoke of some one who would be confounded by stephenâ€™s
return, having put him out of the way.  louisa had never spoken of
harbouring any suspicion of her brother in connexion with the robbery,
she and sissy had held no confidence on the subject, save in that one
interchange of looks when the unconscious father rested his gray head on
his hand; but it was understood between them, and they both knew it.
this other fear was so awful, that it hovered about each of them like a
ghostly shadow; neither daring to think of its being near herself, far
less of its being near the other.

that a man had fallen down the old hell shaft, he started out to a pool
of dirty water, put his head in it, and came back sober.

with these two men she ran to another half-a-mile further, and with that
one to another, while they ran elsewhere.  then a horse was found; and
she got another man to ride for life or death to the railroad, and send a
message to louisa, which she wrote and gave him.  by this time a whole
village was up: and windlasses, ropes, poles, candles, lanterns, all
things necessary, were fast collecting and being brought into one place,
to be carried to the old hell shaft.

it seemed now hours and hours since she had left the lost man lying in
the grave where he had been buried alive.  she could not bear to remain
away from it any longerâ€”it was like deserting himâ€”and she hurried swiftly
back, accompanied by half-a-dozen labourers,

le that the man would be found alive was very slight
indeed.

there being now people enough present to impede the work, the sobered man
put himself at the head of the rest, or was put there by the general
consent, and made a large ring round the old hell shaft, and appointed
men to keep it.  besides such volunteers as were accepted to work, only
sissy and rachael were at first permitted within this ring; but, later in
the day, when the message brought an express from coketown, mr. gradgrind
and louisa, and mr. bounderby, and the whelp, were also there.

the sun was four hours lower than when sissy and rachael had first sat
down upon the grass, before a means of enabling two men to descend
securely was rigged with poles and ropes.  difficulties had arisen in the
construction of this machine, simple as it was; requisites had been found
wanting, and messages had had to go and return.  it was five oâ€™clock in
the afternoon of the bright autumnal sunday, before a candle was sent
down to try the

â€˜thy little sister, rachael, thou hast not forgot her.  thouâ€™rt not like
to forget her now, and me so nigh her.  thou knowâ€™stâ€”poor, patient,
suffâ€™rin, dearâ€”how thou didst work for her, seetâ€™n all day long in her

oâ€™ sickly air as hadâ€™n no need to be, anâ€™ awlung oâ€™ working peopleâ€™s
miserable homes.  a muddle!  aw a muddle!â€™

louisa approached him; but he could not see her, lying with his face
turned up to the night sky.

louisa hearing what he said, bent over him on the opposite side to
rachael, so that he could see her.

â€˜you haâ€™ heard?â€™ he said, after a few momentsâ€™ silence.  â€˜i haâ€™ not
forgot you, ledy.â€™

â€˜yes, stephen, i have heard you.  and your prayer is mine.â€™

â€˜you haâ€™ a father.  will yo takâ€™ a message to him?â€™

over the wide landscape; rachael always holding the hand in hers.  very
few whispers broke the mournful silence.  it was soon a funeral
procession.  the star had shown him where to find the god of the poor;
and through humility, and sorrow, and forgiveness, he had gone to his
redeemerâ€™s rest.



chapter vii
whelp-hunting


before the ring formed round the old hell shaft was broken, one figure
had disappeared from within it.  mr. bounderby and his shadow had not
stood near louisa, who held her fatherâ€™s arm, but in a retired place by
themselves.  when mr. gradgrind was summoned to the couch, sissy,
attentive to all that happened, slipped behind that wicked shadowâ€”a sight
in the horror of his face, if there had been eyes there for any sight but
oneâ€”and whispered in his ear.  without turning his head, he conferred
with her a few moments, and vanished.  thus the whelp had gone out of the
circle before the people moved.

when the father reached home, he sent a message 
 
 ___________________________
 
to mr. bounderbyâ€™s,
desiring his son to come to him directly.  the reply was, that mr.
bounderby having missed him in the crowd, and seeing nothing of him
since, had supposed him to be at stone lodge.

â€˜i believe, father,â€™ said louisa, â€˜he will not come back to town
to-night.â€™  mr. gradgrind turned away, and said no more.

in the morning, he went down to the bank himself as soon as it was
opened, and seeing his sonâ€™s place empty (he had not the courage to look
in at first) went back along the street to meet mr. bounderby on his way
there.  to whom he said that, for reasons he would soon explain, but
entreated not then to be asked for, he had found it necessary to employ
his son at a distance for a little while.  also, 
 
 ___________________________
 
that he was charged with
the duty of vindicating stephen blackpoolâ€™s memory, and declaring the
thief.  mr. bounderby quite confounded, stood stock-still in the street
after his father-in-law had left him, swelling like an immense
soap-bubble, without its beauty.

mr. gradgrind went home, locked himself in his room, and kept it all that
day.  when sissy and louisa tapped at his door, he said, without opening
it, â€˜not now, my dears; in the evening.â€™  on their return in the evening,
he said, â€˜i am not able yetâ€”to-morrow.â€™  he ate nothing all day, and had
no candle after dark; and they heard him walking to and fro late at
night.

but, in the morning he appeared at breakfast at the usual hour, and took
his usual place at the table.  aged and bent he looked, and quite bowed
down; and yet he looked a wiser man, and a better man, than in the days
when
 
 ___________________________
 
 in this life he wanted nothingâ€”but facts.  before he left the room,
he appointed a time for them to come to him; and so, with his gray head
drooping, went away.

â€˜dear father,â€™ said louisa, when they kept their appointment, â€˜you have
three young children left.  they will be different, i will be different
yet, with heavenâ€™s help.â€™

she gave her hand to sissy, as if she meant with her help too.

â€˜your wretched brother,â€™ said mr. gradgrind.  â€˜do you think he had
planned this robbery, when he went with you to the lodging?â€™

â€˜i fear so, father.  i know he had wanted money very much, and had spent
a great deal.â€™

â€˜the poor man being about to leave the town, it came

te with him.â€™

â€˜he had some conversation with the poor man.  did he take him aside?â€™

â€˜he took him out of the room.  i asked him afterwards, why he had done
so, and he made a plausible excuse; but since last night, father, and
when i remember the circumstances by its light, i am afraid i can imagine
too truly what passed between them.â€™

â€˜let me know,â€™ said her father, â€˜if your thoughts present your guilty
brother in the same dark view as mine.â€™

â€˜i fear, father,â€™ hesitated louisa, â€˜that he must have made some
representation to stephen blackpoolâ€”perhaps in my name, perhaps in his
ownâ€”which induced him to do in good faith and honesty, what he had never
done before, and to wait about the bank those two or three nights before
he left the town.â€™

â€˜too plain!â€™ returned the father.  â€˜too plain!â€™

he shaded his face, and remained silent for some moments.  recovering
himself, he said:

â€˜and now, how is he to be found?  how is he to be saved from justice?  in
th

e few hours that i can possibly allow to elapse before i publish the
truth, how is he to be found by us, and only by us?  ten thousand pounds
could not effect it.â€™

â€˜sissy has effected it, father.â€™

he raised his eyes to where she stood, like a good fairy in his house,
and said in a tone of softened gratitude and grateful kindness, â€˜it is
always you, my child!â€™

â€˜we had our fears,â€™ sissy explained, glancing at louisa, â€˜before
yesterday; and when i saw you brought to the side of the litter last
night, and heard what passed (being close to rachael all the time), i
went to him when no one saw, and said to him, â€œdonâ€™t look at me.  see
where your father is.  escape at once, for his sake and your own!â€  he
was in a tremble before i whispered to him, and he started and trembled
more then, and said, â€œwhere can i go?  i have very little money, and i
donâ€™t know who will hide me!â€  i thought of fatherâ€™

˜he may be got abroad yet.â€™

it was the more hopeful as the town to which sissy had directed him was
within three hoursâ€™ journey of liverpool, whence he could be swiftly
dispatched to any part of the world.  but, caution being necessary in
communicating with himâ€”for there was a greater danger every moment of his
being suspected now, and nobody could be sure at heart but that mr.
bounderby himself, in a bullying vein of public zeal, might play a roman
partâ€”it was consented that sissy and louisa should repair to the place in
question, by a circuitous course, alone; and that the unhappy father,
setting forth in an opposite direction, should get round to the same
bourne by another and wider route.  it was further agreed that he should
not present himself to mr. sleary, lest his intentions should be
mistrusted, or the intelligence of his arrival should cause his son to
take flight anew; but, that the communication should be left to sissy and
louisa to open; and that they should inform the

iflower act), and mr. sleary appeared, leading her
in.

mr. sleary had only made one cut at the clown with his long whip-lash,
and the clown had only said, â€˜if you do it again, iâ€™ll throw the horse at
you!â€™ when sissy was recognised both by father and daughter.  but they
got through the act with great self-possession; and mr. sleary, saving
for the first instant, conveyed no more expression into his locomotive
eye than into his fixed one.  the performance seemed a little long to
sissy and louisa, particularly when it stopped to afford the clown an
opportunity of telling mr. sleary (who said â€˜indeed, sir!â€™ to all his
observations in the calmest way, and with his eye on the house) about two
legs sitting on three legs looking at one leg, when in came four legs,
and laid hold of one leg, and up got two legs, caught hold of three legs,
and threw â€™em at four legs, who ran away with one leg.  for, although an
ingenious allegory relating to a butcher, a three-legged stool, a dog,
and a l

eg of mutton, this narrative consumed time; and they were in great
suspense.  at last, however, little fair-haired josephine made her
curtsey amid great applause; and the clown, left alone in the ring, had
just warmed himself, and said, â€˜now _i_â€™ll have a turn!â€™ when sissy was
touched on the shoulder, and beckoned out.

she took louisa with her; and they were received by mr. sleary in a very
little private apartment, with canvas sides, a grass floor, and a wooden
ceiling all aslant, on which the box company stamped their approbation,
as if they were coming through.  â€˜thethilia,â€™ said mr. sleary, who had
brandy and water at hand, â€˜it doth me good to thee you.  you wath alwayth
a favourite with uth, and youâ€™ve done uth credith thinth the old timeth
iâ€™m thure.  you mutht thee our people, my dear, afore we thpeak of

love with her from the frontâ€”and heâ€™th a
overtheer and makinâ€™ a fortun.â€™

these various changes, mr. sleary, very short of breath now, related with
great heartiness, and with a wonderful kind of innocence, considering
what a bleary and brandy-and-watery old veteran he was.  afterwards he
brought in josephine, and e. w. b. childers (rather deeply lined in the
jaws by daylight), and the little wonder of scholastic equitation, and in
a word, all the company.  amazing creatures they were in louisaâ€™s eyes,
so white and pink of complexion, so scant of dress, and so demonstrative
of leg; but it was very agreeable to see them crowding about sissy, and
very natural in sissy to be unable to refrain from tears.

â€˜there!  now thethilia hath kithd all the children, and hugged all the
women, and thaken handth all round with all the men, clear, every one of
you, and ring in the band for the thecond part!â€™

as soon as they were gone, he continued in a low tone.  â€˜now, thethilia,

mith.  and i hope the thquireâ€™th well?â€™

â€˜my father will be here soon,â€™ said louisa, anxious to bring him to the
point.  â€˜is my brother safe?â€™

â€˜thafe and thound!â€™ he replied.  â€˜i want you jutht to take a peep at the
ring, mith, through here.  thethilia, you know the dodgeth; find a

they each looked through a chink in the boards.

â€˜thatâ€™h jack the giant killerâ€”piethe of comic infant bithnith,â€™ said

â€˜yes,â€™ they both said.

thay ith, the thquire hath thtood by thethilia, and iâ€™ll thtand by the
thquire.  your brother ith one them black thervanth.â€™

louisa uttered an exclamation, partly of distress, partly of
satisfaction.

â€˜ith a fact,â€™ said sleary, â€˜and even knowinâ€™ it, you couldnâ€™t put your
finger on him.  let the thquire come.  i thall keep your brother here

louisa, with many thanks and with a lightened load, detained mr. sleary
no longer then.  she left her love for her brother, with her eyes full of
tears; and she and sissy went away until later in the afternoon.

mr. gradgrind arrived within an hour afterwards.  he too had encountered
no one whom he knew; and was now sanguine with slearyâ€™s assistance, of
getting his disgraced son to liverpool in the night.  as neither of the
three could be his companion without almost identifying him under any

ugh the greasy composition
daubed all over it; anything so grimly, detestably, ridiculously shameful
as the whelp in his comic livery, mr. gradgrind never could by any other
means have believed in, weighable and measurable fact though it was.  and
one of his model children had come to this!

at first the whelp would not draw any nearer, but persisted in remaining
up there by himself.  yielding at length, if any concession so sullenly
made can be called yielding, to the entreaties of sissyâ€”for louisa he
disowned altogetherâ€”he came down, bench by bench, until he stood in the
sawdust, on the verge of the circle, as far as possible, within its
limits from where his father sat.

â€˜how was this done?â€™ asked the father.

â€˜how was what done?â€™ moodily answered the son.

â€˜this robbery,â€™ said the father, raising his voice upon the word.

â€˜i forced the safe myself over night, and shut it up ajar before i went
away.  i had had the key that was found, made long before.  i dropped it

delicately retired.

â€˜here is your letter,â€™ said mr. gradgrind.  â€˜all necessary means will be
provided for you.  atone, by repentance and better conduct, for the
shocking action you have committed, and the dreadful consequences to
which it has led.  give me your hand, my poor boy, and may god forgive
you as i do!â€™

the culprit was moved to a few abject tears by these words and their
pathetic tone.  but, when louisa opened her arms, he repulsed her afresh.

â€˜not you.  i donâ€™t want to have anything to say to you!â€™

â€˜o tom, tom, do we end so, after all my love!â€™

â€˜after all your love!â€™ he returned, obdurately.  â€˜pretty love!  leaving
old bounderby to himself, and packing my best friend mr. harthouse off,
and going home just when i was in the greatest danger.  pretty love that!

â€˜tharpâ€™th the word!â€™ said sleary, at the door.

they all confusedly went out: louisa crying to him that she forgave him,
and loved him still, and that he would one day be sorry to have left her
so, and glad to think of these her last words, far away: when some one
ran against them.  mr. gradgrind and sissy, who were both before him
while his sister yet clung to his shoulder, stopped and recoiled.

for, there was bitzer, out of breath, his thin lips parted, his thin
nostrils distended, his white eyelashes quivering, his colourless face
more colourless than ever, as if he ran him

inch of the existence of mankind, from birth to death, was to be a
bargain across a counter.  and if we didnâ€™t get to heaven that way, it
was not a politico-economical place, and we had no business there.

â€˜i donâ€™t deny,â€™ added bitzer, â€˜that my schooling was cheap.  but that
comes right, sir.  i was made in the cheapest market, and have to dispose
of myself in the dearest.â€™

he was a little troubled here, by louisa and sissy crying.

â€˜pray donâ€™t do that,â€™ said he, â€˜itâ€™s of no use doing that: it only
worries.  you seem to think that i have some animosity against young mr.
tom; whereas i have none at all.  i am only going, on the reasonable
grounds i have mentioned, to take him back to coketown.  if he was to
resist, i should set up the cry of stop thief!  but, he wonâ€™t resist, you
may depend upon it.â€™

mr. sleary, who with his mouth open and his rolling eye as immovably
jammed in his head as

more, but iâ€™ll do that.â€™

fresh lamentations from louisa, and deeper affliction on mr. gradgrindâ€™s
part, followed this desertion of them by their last friend.  but, sissy
glanced at him with great attention; nor did she in her own breast
misunderstand him.  as they were all going out again, he favoured her
with one slight roll of his movable eye, desiring her to linger behind.
as he locked the door, he said excitedly:

â€˜the thquire thtood by you, thethilia, and iâ€™ll thtand by the thquire.
more than that: thith ith a prethiouth rathcal, and belo

all these little tokens of his gratitude, mr. gradgrind very willingly
undertook to render.  though he thought them far too slight, he said, for
such a service.

â€˜very well, thquire; then, if youâ€™ll only give a horthe-riding, a
bethpeak, whenever you can, youâ€™ll more than balanthe the account.  now,
thquire, if your daughter will ethcuthe me, i thould like one parting
word with you.â€™

louisa and sissy withdrew into an adjoining room; mr. sleary, stirring
and drinking his brandy and water as he stood, went on:

â€˜thquire,â€”you donâ€™t need to be told that dogth ith wonderful animalth.â€™

â€˜their instinct,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, â€˜is surprising.â€™

sleary, â€˜it ith athtonithing.  the way in whith a dogâ€™ll find youâ€”the

he see them, in the era of its being quite settled that the national
dustmen have only to do with one another, and owe no duty to an
abstraction called a people, â€˜taunting the honourable gentlemanâ€™ with
this and with that and with what not, five nights a-week, until the small
hours of the morning?  probably he had that much foreknowledge, knowing
his men.

here was louisa on the night of the same day, watching the fire as in
days of yore, though with a gentler and a humbler face.  how much of the
future might arise before _her_ vision?  broadsides in the streets,
signed with her fatherâ€™s name, exonerating the late stephen blackpool,
weaver, from misplaced suspicion, and publishing the guilt of his own
son, with such extenuation as his years and temptation (he could not
bring himself to add, his education) might beseech; were of the present.
