hand on the door in spite of it. to brace myself and so i can get out quickly if i have
to. iâ€™ve driven in the same car with them before but on this road it doesnâ€™t seem
right, either the three of them are in the wrong place or i am.
iâ€™m in the back seat with the packsacks; this one, joe, is sitting beside me chewing
gum and holding my hand, they both pass the time. i examine the hand: the palm is
broad, the short fingers tighten and relax, fiddling with my gold ring, turning it, itâ€™s
a reflex of his. he has peasant hands, i have peasant feet, anna told us that. everyone
now can do a little magic, she reads hands at parties, she says itâ€™s a substitute for
conversation. when she did mine she said â€œdo you have a twin?â€ i said no. â€œare
you positive,â€ she said, â€œbecau

sensitive and i laughed, which was a mistake.
from the side heâ€™s like the buffalo on the u .s. nickel, shaggy and blunt-snouted,
with small clenched eyes and the defiant but insane look of a species once dominant,
now threatened with extinction. thatâ€™s how he thinks of himself too: deposed,
unjustly. secretly he would like them to set up a kind of park for him, like a bird
sanctuary. beautiful joe.

i lean forward and say to david, â€œthe bottle house is around this next curve and
to the left,â€ and he nods and slows the car. i told them about it earlier, i guessed it
was the kind of object that would interest them. theyâ€™re making a movie, joe is
doing the camera work, heâ€™s never done it before but david says theyâ€™re the new
renaissance men, you teach yourself what you need to learn. it was mostly davidâ€™s
idea, he calls himself the director: they already have the credits worked out. he
wants to get shots of things they come across, random samples he calls them, and
that will be the name of the movie too: random samples. when theyâ€™ve used up their
supply of film (which was all they could afford; and the camera is rented) theyâ

remember till we reach the border, marked by the sign that says bienvenu e on one side
and welcome on the other. the sign has bullet holes in it, rusting red around the edges. it
always did, in the fall the hunters use it for target practice; no matter how many
times they replace it or paint it the bullet holes reappear, as though they arenâ€™t put
there but grow by a kind of inner logic or infection, like mould or boils. joe wants
to film the sign but david says â€œnaaa, what for?â€
now weâ€™re on my home ground, foreign territory. my throat constricts, as it
learned to do when i discovered people could say words that would go into my ears
meaning nothing. to be deaf and dumb would be easier. the cards they poke at you

to learn spelling.

better.
nothing is the same, i donâ€™t know the way any more. i slide my tongue around the

shake, why is the road different, he shouldnâ€™t have allowed them to do it, i want to

thereâ€™s a thing that isnâ€™t supposed to be here. motel, bar biÃ¨re beer the sign reads, neon even,

notice is up. the building is like any other cheap motel, long grey stucco with
aluminum doors; the earth around it is still chunky and raw, not yet overgrown with
the road weeds.
â€œletâ€™s pick up a few,â€ david says, to joe; heâ€™s already swerved the car.
we head towards the door but then i stop, itâ€™s the best place to leave them, and say
â€œyou go in and have a beer or something, iâ€™ll be back in about half an hour.â€
â€œright,â€ david says. he knows what to avoid.
â€œwant me to come?â€ joe offers, but when i say no relief gleams through his
beard. the three of them disappear through the screen door of the bar and i walk the
rest of the way down the hill.

doing me a favour, which they disguised by saying it would be fun, they like to
travel. but my reason for being here embarrasses them, they donâ€™t understand it.
they all disowned their parents long ago, the way you are supposed to: joe never
mentions his mother and father, anna says hers were nothing people and david calls
his the pigs.
there was a covered bridge here once, but it was too far north to be quaint. they
tore it down three years before i left, to improve the dam, and replaced it with the
concrete bridge which is here now, enormous, monumental, dwarfing the village.
itâ€™s the dam that controls the lake: sixty years ago they raised the lake level so that

â€œyes, heâ€™s here,â€ i say, skipping over the lie even in my own mind. what he means
is that a man should be handling this; joe will do as a stand-in. my status is a
problem, they obviously think iâ€™m married. but iâ€™m safe, iâ€™m wearing my ring, i
never threw it out, itâ€™s useful for landladies. i sent my parents a postcard after the
wedding, they must have mentioned it to paul; that, but not the divorce. it isnâ€™t part

exhibit, string wall hangings, woven place mats, stoneware breakfast sets; joe
wanted to go so he could resent not being in it. the man seemed to be a cultural

unconscious, maybe heâ€™s doing it for claude, to make it clear he too is a man of the
people. or maybe itâ€™s an experiment in communications, thatâ€™s what he teaches, at
night, the same place joe works; itâ€™s an adult education programme. david calls it
adult vegetation; he got the job because he was once a radio announcer.

from showing any reaction, no matter what has happened.
â€œno,â€ i say, â€œnothing different.â€ voice level, calm. perhaps that was what he liked
about me, there must have been something, though i canâ€™t reconstruct our first

make him out a licence, it seems claude is in charge of the licences. when david
comes back i want to ask how much he paid, but heâ€™s too pleased, i donâ€™t want to
spoil it. claude is pleased also.
we find out from claude we can hire evans, who owns the blue moon cabins, to
run us down the lake. paul would take us for nothing, he offered, but i wouldnâ€™t feel
right about it; also iâ€™m sure he would misinterpret joeâ€™s amorphous beard and
davidâ€™s moustache and three musketeers hair. theyâ€™re just a style now, like crew
cuts, but paul might feel they are dangerous, they mean riots.
david eases the car down the turnoff, two ruts and a rock hump in the centre that
scrapes the carâ€™s belly. we brake in front of the cabin marked office; evans is there, a
bulky laconic american in checked shirt and peaked cap and a thick knitted jacket
with an eagle on the back. he knows where my fatherâ€™s place is, all th

i hope the door will be open but itâ€™s padlocked, as paul said he left it. i dig the
keys he gave me out of my bag and approach warily: whatever i find inside will be a
clue. what if he returned after paul locked it and couldnâ€™t get in? but there are other
ways of getting in, he could have broken a window.
joe and david are here now with the other packsacks and the beer. anna is behind
them with my case and the paper bag; sheâ€™s singing again, mockingbird hill.
i open the wooden door and the screen door inside it and scan the room
cautiously, then step inside. table covered with blue oilcloth, bench, another bench
which is a wooden box built against the wall, sofa with metal frame and thin
mattress, it folds out into a bed. that was where our mother used to be: all day she

we spoke to her; but the next day she would be the same as she had always been. we
came to have faith in her ability to recover, from anything; we ceased to take her
illnesses seriously, they were only natural phases, like cocoons. when she died i
was disappointed in her.
nothing is out of place. water drops fall on the roof, down from the trees.
they follow me inside. â€œis this where you lived?â€ joe asks. itâ€™s unusual for him to
ask me anything about myself: i canâ€™t tell whether heâ€™s pleased or discouraged. he
goes over to the snowshoes on the wall and lifts one down, taking refuge in his
hands.
anna puts the groceries on the counter and wraps her arms around herself. â€œit
must have been weird,â€ she says. â€œcut off from everything like that.â€

thereâ€™s kindling in the box behind the stove and a few pieces of white birch; the
disease hasnâ€™t yet hit this part of the country. i find the matches and kneel in front of
the stove, iâ€™ve almost forgotten how to do this but after three or four matches i get it
lit.
i take the round enamelled bowl down from its hook and the big knife. they
watch me: none of them asks me where iâ€™m going, though joe seems worried.
perhaps heâ€™s been expecting me to have hysterics and heâ€™s anxious because iâ€™m not
having any. â€œiâ€™m going to the garden,â€ i say to reassure them. they know where that
is, they could see it from the lake coming in.
grass is growing up in the path and in front of the gate; the weeds are a month
tall. ordinarily i would spend a few hours pulling them out, but it isnâ€™t worth it,
weâ€™ll be here only two days.

married me, we committed that paper act. i still donâ€™t see why signing a name
should make any difference but he began to expect things, he wanted to be pleased.
we should have kept sleeping together and left it at that.
joe puts his arm around me, i take hold of his fingers. what iâ€™m seeing is the
black and white tugboat that used to be on the lake, or was it flat like a barge, it
towed the log booms slowly down towards the dam, i waved at it whenever we went
past in our boat and the men would wave back. it had a little house on it for them to
live in, with windows and a stovepipe coming out through the roof. i felt that would
be the best way to live, in a floating house carrying everything you needed with you

moving their leaves, the sound ripples; the water gives off icy light, zinc moon
breaking on small waves. loon voice, each hair on my body lifting with the shiver;
the echoes deflect from all sides, surrounding us, here everything echoes.

learned to sleep through that. i used to know the species; i listen, my ears are rusty,
thereâ€™s nothing but a jumble of sound. they sing for the same reason trucks honk, to
proclaim their territories: a rudimentary language. linguistics, i should have
studied that instead of art.
joe is half-awake too and groaning to himself, the sheet pulled around his head
like a cowl. heâ€™s torn the blankets up from the bottom of the bed and his lean feet
stick out, toes with the deprived look of potatoes sprouted in the bag. i wonder if
heâ€™ll remember he woke me when it was still dark, sitting up and saying â€œwhere is
this?â€ every time weâ€™re in a new place he does that. â€œitâ€™s all right,â€ i said, â€œiâ€™m

below the pictures at the foot of the bed thereâ€™s a grey leather jacket hanging on a
nail. itâ€™s dirty and the leather is cracked and peeling. i see it for a while before i
recognize it: it belonged to my mother a long time ago, she kept sunflower seeds in
the pockets. i thought sheâ€™d thrown it out; it shouldnâ€™t still be here, he should have
got rid of it after the funeral. dead peopleâ€™s clothes ought to be buried with them.
i turn over and shove joe further against the wall so i can curl up.
i surface again later; joe is wide awake now, heâ€™s come out from under the sheet.
â€œyou talked in your sleep again,â€ i tell him. sometimes i think he says more when
heâ€™s asleep than he does when heâ€™s awake.
he gives a noncommittal growl. â€œiâ€™m hungry.â€ then, after a pause, â€œwhat did i
say?â€
â€œthe usual. you wanted to know where you were and who i was.â€ iâ€™d like to hear
about the dream itself; i used to have dreams but i donâ€™t a

i reach down for the eggs; the bacon is in a screened box under the cabin,
ventilated but protected from flies and mice. in a settlerâ€™s house these would have
been rootcellar and smoke-house; my father is an improvisor on standard themes.
i carry the food inside and start the breakfast. joe and david are up, joe sitting on
the wall bench, face still fuzzy with sleep, david examining his chin in the mirror.
â€œi can make you hot water if you want to shave,â€ i suggest, but his reflection grins
and he shakes his head.
â€œnaaa,â€ he says, â€œiâ€™m gonna grow me a little old beard.â€
â€œdonâ€™t you dare,â€ anna says. â€œi donâ€™t like him kissing me when he has a beard, it

itâ€™s a quick skit, joe and i are the audience, but joe is still off in the place inside
himself where he spends most of his time and iâ€™m at the stove turning the bacon, i
canâ€™t watch them so they stop.
i crouch down in front of the stove and open the firebox door to make the toast
over the coals. there are no dirty words any more, theyâ€™ve been neutered, now
theyâ€™re only parts of speech; but i recall the feeling, puzzled, baffled, when i found
out some words were dirty and the rest were clean. the bad ones in french are the

i give david the machete, i donâ€™t know what shape the trail will be in, we may

ankles with bug spray, and my own also. i used to be immune to mosquitoes, iâ€™d
been bitten so much, but iâ€™ve lost it: on my legs and body are several itchy pink
bumps from last night. the sound of love in the north, a kiss, a slap.

â€œhow come it didnâ€™t work out, with you?â€ anna said.
â€œi donâ€™t know,â€ i said, â€œi guess i was too young.â€
she nodded sympathetically. â€œyouâ€™re lucky you didnâ€™t have kids though.â€
â€œyes,â€ i said. she doesnâ€™t have any herself; if she did she couldnâ€™t have said that to
me. iâ€™ve never told her about the baby; i havenâ€™t told joe either, thereâ€™s no reason to.
he wonâ€™t find out the usual way, there arenâ€™t any pictures of it peering out from a
crib or a window or through the bars of a playpen in my bureau drawer or my
billfold where he could stumble across them and act astonished or outraged or sad. i
have to behave as though it doesnâ€™t exist, because for me it canâ€™t, it was taken away

the trail dips down and across a swamp inlet at the tip of a bay, cedars here and
bullrushes, blueflags, ooze. i go slowly, looking for footprints. thereâ€™s nothing but
a deer track, no sign of anyone: apparently paul and the searchers didnâ€™t make it this
far. the mosquitoes have scented us and swarm around our heads; joe swears
gently, david loudly, at the end of the line i hear anna slapping.
we swing away from the shore and here itâ€™s a jungle, branches growing in across
the path, hazel and moose maple, pithy junk trees. sight is blocked two feet in,
trunks and leaves a solid interlocking fence, green, green-grey, greybrown. none of
the branches is chopped or broken back, if heâ€™s been here heâ€™s gone miraculously
around and between them rather than through. i stand aside and david hacks at the

we come up against a tree fallen across the trail. itâ€™s brought several young
balsams down with it: they lie tangled together, logjam. â€œi donâ€™t think anyoneâ€™s been
through here,â€ i say, and joe says â€œright on,â€ heâ€™s annoyed: itâ€™s obvious. i peer into
the forest to see if another trail has been cut around the windfall but thereâ€™s no sign;
or there are too many signs, since iâ€™m anxious every opening between two trees
looks like a path.
david prods at the dead trunk with the machete, poking holes in the bark. joe sits
down on the ground: heâ€™s breathing hard, too much city, and the flies are getting to
him, he scratches his neck and the backs of his hands. â€œi guess thatâ€™

ring lost on a beach or in the snow: futile. thereâ€™s no act i can perform except
waiting; tomorrow evans will ship us to the village, and after that weâ€™ll travel to the
city and the present tense. iâ€™ve finished what i came for and i donâ€™t want to stay here,
i want to go back to where there is electricity and distraction. iâ€™m used to it now,
filling the time without it is an effort.
the others are trying to amuse themselves. joe and david are out in one of the
canoes; i should have made them take life-jackets, neither of them can steer, theyâ€™re
shifting their paddles from side to side. i can see them from the front window and
from the side window i can see anna, partly hidden by trees. sheâ€™s lying on her
belly in bikini and sunglasses, reading a murder mystery, though she must be cold:
the sky has cleared a little, but when the clouds move in front of the sun the heat

when distance has disguised their faces and their awkwardness, might be my brother

did in the afternoons between the routines of lunch and supper. sometimes she

shoulders, unexpectedly slight hips, hands whose texture i can still feel on my skin,
roughened and leathery from the clay. everything i value about him seems to be

â€œwhatever happens,â€ i tell them, â€œstay in the middle.â€ we move ponderously out
of the bay. iâ€™ve taken on too much: i havenâ€™t been in a canoe for years, my muscles
are shot, joe paddles as though heâ€™s stirring the lake with a ladle and weâ€™re down by
the bow. but none of them will know the difference. i think, itâ€™s a good thing our
lives donâ€™t depend on catching a fish. starvation, bite your arm and suck the blood,
thatâ€™s what they do on lifeboats; or the indian way, if thereâ€™s no bait try a chunk of
your flesh.

david jerks the rod with his whole body and it sails across and flops into the canoe,
a dumb move, he couldâ€™ve lost it, on top of anna and she lurches, screaming â€œget it
off me! get it off me!â€ and we almost tip. joe says â€œholy shitâ€ and grabs at the side,
i bend the other way, counterbalancing, david is snatching at it. it slithers over the
canoe ribs, flippering and snapping.
â€œhere,â€ i say, â€œhit it back of the eyes.â€ i reach him the sheathed knife, iâ€™d rather
not kill it myself.
david swipes at it, misses; anna cover her eyes and says â€œugh. ugh.â€ it flops
towards me and i step down on it with my foot and grab the knife and whack it

plates. that was before the house was built, we were living outside in tents. our
father said they went in cycles.
â€œneat eh?â€ david says to the others; heâ€™s excited, he wants praise. â€œugh,â€ says
anna, â€œitâ€™s slimy, iâ€™m not going to eat any of it.â€ joe grunts, i wonder if heâ€™s
jealous.
david wants to try for another; itâ€™s like gambling, you only stop if you lose. i

around us the illusion of infinite space or of no space, ourselves and the obscure
shore which it seems we could touch, the water between an absence. the canoeâ€™s
reflection floats with us, the paddles twin in the lake. itâ€™s like moving on air, nothing
beneath us holding us up; suspended, we drift home.
chapter eight
in the early morning joe wakes me; his hands at any rate are intelligent, they move
over me delicately as a blind manâ€™s reading braille, skilled, moulding me like a
vase, theyâ€™re learning me; they repeat patterns heâ€™s tried before, theyâ€™ve found out
what works, and my body responds that way too, anticipates him, educated, crisp as
a typewriter. itâ€™s best when you donâ€™t know them. a phrase comes to me, a joke then
but mournful now, someone in a parked car after a highschool dance who said with

as iâ€™m washing the fillets david saunters down to the dock with his toothbrush.
â€œhey,â€ he says, â€œis that my fish?â€ he regards the guts on the plate with interest.
â€œhold it,â€ he says, â€œthatâ€™s a random sample.â€ he goes for joe and the camera and
the two of them solemnly film the fish innards, collapsed bladders and tubes and
soft ropes, rearranging them between takes for better angles. it would never occur
to david to have someone snap him with a brownie camera holding his fish up by
the tail and grinning, nor would he ever have it stuffed and mounted; still, he wants
to immortalize it, in his own way. photo album, iâ€™m in it somewhere, successive
incarnations of me preserved and flattened like flowers pressed in di

â€œi like it here,â€ david says. no sound from the others. â€œletâ€™s stay on for a while, a
week, itâ€™d be great.â€
â€œdonâ€™t you have that seminar?â€ anna says dubiously. â€œman and his electricity
environment, or something?â€
â€œelectrifying. thatâ€™s not till august.â€
â€œi donâ€™t think we should,â€ anna says.
â€œhow come you never want us to do anything i want to do?â€ david says, and
thereâ€™s a pause. then he says â€œwhat dâ€™you think?â€ and joe says â€œokay by me.â€
â€œgreat,â€ says david, â€œweâ€™ll do some more fishing.â€
i sit down on the bed. they might have asked me first, itâ€™s my house. though
maybe theyâ€™re waiting till i come out, theyâ€™ll ask then. if i say i donâ€™t want to they
canâ€™t very well stay; but what reason can i give? i canâ€™t tell them about my father,
betray him; anyway they might think i was making it up. thereâ€™s my work, but they
know i have it with me. i could leave by myself with evans but iâ€™d o

for a moment theyâ€™re startled, they realize iâ€™ve overheard. then david says â€œno
sweat.â€ he gives me a quick look, triumphant and appraising, as though heâ€™s just
won something: not a war but a lottery.
when evans turns up at the appointed time david and joe go down to the dock to
arrange things with him. i warned them not to say anything about the fish: if they do,
this part of the lake will be swarming with americans, they have an uncanny way of
passing the word, like ants about sugar, or lobsters. after a few minutes i hear the
boat starting again and accelerating and diminishing, heâ€™s gone.
iâ€™ve avoided evans and the explanation and negotiations by going up to the
outhouse and latching myself in. that was where i went when there was somethi

be harmless but i couldnâ€™t be sure.
we finished lunch and i took the breadcrumbs out to the tray for the birds. the
jays had discovered there were people living in the cabin; theyâ€™re intelligent, they
knew a figure near the tray signalled food; or perhaps a few of them were old
enough to remember the image of my mother, hand outstretched. two or three of
them stood sentinel now, out of reach, wary.
joe followed me out and watched as i spread the crumbs. he put his fingers on my
arm, frowning at me, which may have meant he wanted to talk to me: speech to him
was a task, a battle, words mustered behind his beard and issued one at a time, heavy
and square like tanks. his hand gripped me in a preliminary spasm, but david was
there with the axe.
â€œhey lady,â€ he said, â€œi see your woodpileâ€™s gettinâ€™ low. you could use a handy
man.â€
he wanted to do something useful; and he was right, if we

 were staying a week we
would need a fresh supply. i asked him to find standing trees, dead but not too old or
rotten, â€œyesâ€™m,â€ he said, giving me a burlesque salute.
joe took the small hatchet and went with him. they were from the city, i was
afraid they might chop their feet; though that would be a way out, i thought, weâ€™d
have to go back. but i didnâ€™t need to warn them, about him, they had weapons. he
would see that and run away.
when theyâ€™d disappeared along the trail into the forest i said i was going down to
weed the garden, another job that had to be done. i wanted to keep busy, preserve at
least the signs of order, conceal my fear, both from others

e slashing through the undergrowth marking his progress as he worked his
way around the shore.
â€œhavenâ€™t we done enough?â€ anna asked. â€œi bet iâ€™m getting sunstroke.â€ she sat
back on her heels and took out the un-smoked half of her cigarette. i think she
wanted us to exchange more confidences, she wanted to talk about her other
diseases, but i kept on weeding. potatoes, onions; the strawberry patch was a
hopeless jungle, we wouldnâ€™t do that; in any case the season was over.
david and joe appeared in the long grass outside the fence, one at either end of a
thinnish log. they were proud, theyâ€™d caught something. the log was notched in
many places as though theyâ€™d attacked it.
â€œhi,â€ david called. â€œhowâ€™s the olâ€™ plantation workers?â€
anna stood up. â€œfuck off,â€ she said, squinting at them against the sun.
â€œyouâ€™ve hardly done anything,â€ david said, unquenchable, â€œyou call that a
garden?â€
i measured their axework with my fatherâ€™s summarizing eye. in the

shake hands with them, estimating them shrewdly: could they handle an axe, what
did they know about manure? they would stand there embarrassed in their washed
suburban skins and highschool clothes, uncertain what was expected of them.
â€œthatâ€™s great,â€ i said.
david wanted us to get the movie camera and take some footage of both of them
carrying the log, for random samples; he said it would be his cameo appearance.
joe said we couldnâ€™t work the camera. david said all you did was press a button, an
idiot could do it, anyway it might be even better if it was out of focus or
overexposed, it would introduce the element of chance, like a painter throwing paint
at a canvas, it would be organic. but joe said what if we wrecked the camera, who
would pay for it. in the end they stuck the axe in the log, after several tries, and took
turns shooting each other standing beside it, arms folded and one foot on it as if i

in the evening we played bridge, with the set of slightly greasy cards that had
always been there, blue seahorses on one deck, red seahorses on the other. david
and anna played against us. they won easily: joe didnâ€™t know how, exactly, and i
hadnâ€™t played for years. i was never any good; the only part i liked was picking up
the cards and arranging them.
afterwards i waited for anna to walk up to the outhouse with me; usually i went
first, alone. we took both flashlights; they made protective circles of weak yellow
light, moving with our feet as they walked. rustlings, toads in the dry leaves; once
the quick warning thump of a rabbit. the sounds would be safe as long as i knew
what they were.

 wish i had a warmer sweater,â€ anna said, â€œi didnâ€™t know it got so cold.â€
â€œthereâ€™s some raincoats,â€ i said, â€œyou could try those.â€
when we got back to the cabin the other two were in bed; they didnâ€™t bother going
as far as the outhouse after dark, they peed on the ground. i brushed my teeth; anna
started taking off her makeup by the light of a candle and her flashlight propped on
end, theyâ€™d blown out the lamp.
i went into my room and got undressed. joe mumbled, he was half asleep; i curled
my arm over him.
outside was the wind, trees moving in it, nothing else. the yellow target from
annaâ€™s flashlight was on the ceiling; it shifted, she was going into their room and i
could hear them, anna breathing, a fast panic sound as though she was running; then
her voice began, not like her real voice but twisted as her face must have been, a
desperate beggarâ€™s whine, please please. i put the pillow over my head, i didnâ€™t want
to listen, i wanted

sing, drifting across
the sky, shadows changing without help, uninterrupted air, absence of defining
borders, the only break an occasional distant plane, vapour streak, for them it must
have been like living in a hammock.
in the morning david fished from the dock, catching nothing; anna read, she was
on her fourth or fifth paperback. i swept the floor, the broom webbing itself with
long threads, dark and light, from where anna and i brushed our hair in front of the
mirror; then i tried to work. joe stayed on the wall bench, arms wrapped around his
knees in lawn-dwarf position, watching me. every time i glanced up his eyes would
be there, blue as ball point pens or superman; even with my head turned away i
could feel his x-ray vision prying under my skin, a slight prickling sensation as
though he was tracing me. it was hard to concentrate; i re-read two of the folk tales,
about the king who learned to speak with animals and the fountain of life, but i got
no further than a rough sketch of

they seized on it, glad of the novelty. â€œa groove,â€ david said. anna and i made
peanut butter sandwiches for a mid-afternoon snack; then we basted our noses and
the lobes of our ears with annaâ€™s suntan lotion and started out.
david and anna went in the green canoe, we took the heavier one. they still
couldnâ€™t paddle very well but there wasnâ€™t much wind. i had to use a lot of energy
just to keep us pointed straight, because joe didnâ€™t know how to steer; also he
wouldnâ€™t admit it, which made it harder.
we wavered around the stone point where the trail goes; then we were in the
archipelago of islands, tips of sunken hills, once possibly a single ridge before the
lake was flooded. none of them is big enough to have a name; some are no more
than rocks, with a few trees clutched and knotted to them by the roots. on one of
them, further along, was the heron colony. i had to strain my eyes to spot it: the
young in the ne

sts were keeping their serpent necks and blade heads immobile,
imitating dead branches. the nests were all in a single tree, white pine, grouped for
mutual protection like bungalows on the outskirts. if the herons get within pecking
range they fight.
â€œsee them?â€ i said to joe, pointing.
â€œsee what?â€ he said. he was sweating, overworked, the wind was against us. he
scowled up at the sky but he couldnâ€™t make them out until one of them lifted and
settled, wings balancing.
beyond the heronsâ€™ island was a larger one, flattish, with several red pines rising
straight as masts from a ground harsh with blueberry bushes. we landed and tied the
canoes and i gave each of them a tin cup. the blueberries were only beginning to
ripen, the dots of them showing against the gr

ny blueberries there were, faces neutral and distanced, but when they saw that we
were picking they would move on, gliding unhurried along near the shore and then
disappearing around a point or into a bay as though they had never been there. no
one knew where they lived during the winter; once though we passed two of the
children standing by the side of the road with tin cans of blueberries for sale. it
never occurred to me till now that they must have hated us.
the shore bushes rustled: it was joe, coming down behind me. he squatted on the
stone beside me; his cup was only a third full, sprinkled with leaves and green-white
berries.
â€œtake a rest,â€ he said.
â€œin a minute.â€ i was almost finished. it was hot, light glared from the lake; in the
sun the berries were so blue they seemed lit up from within. falling into the cup they
made a plink like water.
â€œwe should get married,â€ joe said.
i set the cup down carefully on the rock and turned to look at him, shielding my
eyes. i want

 betrayed what iâ€™d assumed were his principles, in order to be saved,
by me, from me, and heâ€™d got nothing by it.
i took his hand; he let me hold it, frowning at me, sullen as a doormat. â€œiâ€™m not
good enough for you,â€ i said, motto, the words printed on a scroll like a fortune
cookie. i kissed him on the side of the face. i was stalling for time, also i was afraid
of him: the look he gave me as i drew away was one of baffled rage.
we were sitting outside in the chicken wire enclosure; joe was in the sandbox with
his back half-turned to us, scraping together a large mound of sand. heâ€™d finished
his pie, the rest of us were still eating. it was too hot to eat in the house, we had to
keep the stove going for two hours. they had purple mouths and blue teeth which
showed when they talked or laughed.
â€œthatâ€™s the best pie i ever ate,â€ david said. â€œjust like mother used to make.â€ he
smacked his lips and posed, pretending to be a t.v. ad.
â€œstuff it,â€ anna said, â€œyou can

davidâ€™s purple mouth grinned. â€œaw,â€ he said, â€œthat was a compliment.â€
â€œthe hell,â€ anna said. â€œiâ€™ve met your mother.â€
david sighed and leaned back against his tree, rolling his eyes to joe for
sympathy. but he got none and so he gazed up at the sky instead. â€œthis is the life,â€ he
said after a while. â€œwe ought to start a colony, i mean a community up here, get it
together with some other people, break away from the urban nuclear family. it
wouldnâ€™t be a bad country if only we could kick out the fucking pig americans, eh?
then we could have some peace.â€
nobody answered him; he took off one of his shoes and began scratching the sole
of his foot thoughtfully.
â€œi think it

â€œwhat would?â€ david said, overly tolerant, as though sheâ€™d interrupted him in
mid-sentence. â€œkicking out the pigs?â€
â€œoh shit,â€ anna said, â€œyou just wonâ€™t.â€
â€œwhat the hell are you talking about?â€ he said, feigning hurt. but she sat hugging
her knees, smoke breathing through her nostrils. i got up and started to collect the
plates.
â€œit turns me on when she bends over,â€ david said. â€œsheâ€™s got a neat ass. iâ€™m really
into the whole ass thing. joe, donâ€™t you think sheâ€™s got a neat ass?â€
â€œyou can have it,â€ joe said. he was levelling the sand mound he had built, he was
still angry.
i scraped the ends of crust into the stove and washed the plates, the water turning
reddish blue, vein colour. the others ambled in; they didnâ€™t feel like playing bridge,
they sat around the table reading detective novels and back issues of magazines,
macleanâ€™s and the national geographic, some of them were ten years old. iâ€™d read
them all so i w

â€œwhatâ€™re you doing in my bed? you a customer or something?â€

room and hid them under the mattress, i didnâ€™t want them spying.

at night joe kept turned away from me, he wasnâ€™t going to compromise. i ran my
fingers over his furry back to show i wanted a truce, the borders restored to where
theyâ€™d been, but after he twitched me off and grunted irritably i withdrew. i curled
up, concentrating on excluding him: he was merely an object in the bed, like a sack
or a large turnip. thereâ€™s more than one way to skin a cat, my father used to say; it
bothered me, i didnâ€™t see why they would want to skin a cat even one way. i stared at

at breakfast he ignored me and the others too, hunching over his plate, mumbling
replies.
â€œwhatâ€™s with him?â€ david said. his new beard was sprouting, a brown smudge on
his chin.
â€œshut up,â€ anna said; but she glanced at me, inquisitive, holding me responsible
for it whatever it was.
joe wiped his sweat shirt sleeve across his mouth and went out of the house,
letting the screen door slam behind him.
â€œmaybe heâ€™s constipated,â€ david said, â€œit makes them grouchy. you sure heâ€™s
been getting enough exercise?â€ then he went â€œarf, arfâ€ like popeye, wiggling his
ears.
â€œstupid,â€ anna said fondly; she rumpled his hair.
â€œhey, donâ€™t do that,â€ he said, â€œitâ€™ll all fall out.â€ he jumped up and went to the

pipelines the yanks will be building in places like this, to get the water down there.â€
he seemed very positive about it, as if it had happened already. i thought about the
survival manuals: if the movement guerillas were anything like david and joe they
would never make it through the winters. they couldnâ€™t get help from the cities,
they would be too far, and the people there would be apathetic, they wouldnâ€™t mind
another change of flag. if they tried at the outlying farms the farmers would take
after them with shotguns. the americans wouldnâ€™t even have to defoliate the trees,
the guerillas would die of starvation and exposure anyway.

â€œitâ€™s spread flat at the end,â€ she said, explaining to us.
â€œi hope you didnâ€™t sell out,â€ david said to me. i shook my head. â€œgood girl,â€ he
said, â€œyour heartâ€™s in the right place. and the rest of her too,â€ he said to joe, â€œi like
it round and firm and fully packed. anna, youâ€™re eating too much.â€
i washed and anna dried, as usual. suddenly anna said â€œdavid is a schmuck. heâ€™s
one of the schmuckiest people i know.â€
i looked around at her: her voice was like fingernails, iâ€™d never heard her talk that
way about david.
â€œwhy?â€ i said. â€œwhatâ€™s wrong?â€ he hadnâ€™t said anything at lunch that could have
upset her.

her, thoughtful; i knew in her place i wouldnâ€™t have done it, i would have let her take

the slop pail was full; i carried it to the garden to pour the dirty water into the
trench. joe was lying by himself on the dock, face down; when i came to rinse the
pail he didnâ€™t move. anna passed me on the steps, wearing her orange bikini, oiled
for her sun ritual.
in the cabin i set the pail under the counter. david was pondering his chin bristles
in the mirror; he slid his arm half around me and said in a guttural voice, â€œcome

â€œhe seems out of sorts,â€ david said, â€œmaybe he has worms; when you get back to
the city you should take him to the vet.â€ and a moment later, â€œhow come you never
laugh at my jokes?â€
he hung around while i set out the brushes and paper. finally he said, â€œwell,

i heard annaâ€™s voice approaching, singing, the words trailing off as her breath
gave out climbing the steps. i went back to the main room.
â€œhi,â€ she said, â€œdo i look burnt?â€
she was pink now, parboiled, white showing around the orange edges of her suit,
neck dividing body colour from applied face colour. â€œa little,â€ i said.
â€œlisten,â€ she said, her voice shifting into concern, â€œwhatâ€™s wrong with joe? i was
down on the dock with him and he didnâ€™t say one word.â€
â€œhe doesnâ€™t talk much,â€ i said.
â€œi know, but this was different. he was just lying there.â€ she was pushing,
demanding answers.
â€œhe thinks we should get married,â€ i said.
her eyebrows lifted like antennae. â€œreally? joe? thatâ€™s not â€¦â€
â€œi donâ€™t want to.â€
â€œoh,â€ she said, â€œthen thatâ€™s awful. you must feel awful.â€ sheâ€™d found out; now she
was rubbing after-sun lotion on her shoulders. â€œmind?â€

something.â€
â€œi have,â€ i said; but her eyes were accusing, i hadnâ€™t done enough, conciliation,
expiation. i went obediently towards the door.
â€œmaybe you can work it out,â€ she called after me.
joe was still on the dock but he was sitting on the edge now with his feet in the
water, i crouched down beside him. his toes had dark hairs on the tops, spaced like
the needles on a balsam twig.
â€œwhat is it?â€ i said. â€œare you sick?â€
â€œyou know fucking well,â€ he said after a minute.
â€œletâ€™s go back to the city,â€ i said, â€œthe way it was before.â€ i took hold of his hand
so i could feel the calloused palm, thickened by the wheel, concrete.

we pushed off from the dock at ten by davidâ€™s watch. the sky was watercolour
blue, the cloud bunches white on the backs and grey on the bellies. wind from the
stern, waves overtaking, my arms lifting and swinging, light and automatic as
though they knew what to do. i was at the front, figurehead; behind me joe shoved at
the water, the canoe surged forward.
the landmarks passed, unscrolling, one-dimensional map thickening into stone
and wood around us: point, cliff, leaning dead tree, heron island with the intricate
bird silhouettes, blueberry island sailed by its mast pines, foregrounds. on the next
island there was once a trapperâ€™s cabin, logs chinked with grass and a straw mound
where the bed had been; i could see nothing left but a muddle of rotting timber.

get off on that, theyâ€™re roving the streets in savage bands armed with garden
shears.â€
â€œiâ€™ll join if you will,â€ anna said to me, joking.
i said â€œi think men ought to be superior.â€ but neither of them heard the actual
words; anna looked at me as though iâ€™d betrayed her and said â€œwow, are you ever
brainwashed,â€ and david said â€œwant a job?â€ and to joe, â€œhear that, youâ€™re
superior.â€ but when joe only grunted he said â€œyou should wire him for sound. or
fix him up with a plug and a shade, heâ€™d make a great end-table lamp. iâ€™m having
him give a guest lecture in adult vegetation next year, â€˜how pots communicate,â€™
heâ€™ll walk in and say nothing for two hours, thatâ€™ll freak them.â€ joe smiled at last,
wanly.

acks were heavy, food for three days in case the weather turned bad and
marooned us; the straps cut into my shoulders, i leaned forward against the weight,
feet squishing in the wet shoes as i walked.
the portage was up over a steep ridge of rock, watershed, then down through
ferns and saplings to an oblong pond, a shallow mud-hole weâ€™d have to paddle
across to reach the second portage. anna and i got there first and set down the
packs; anna had time to smoke half a cigarette before david and joe came
staggering down the trail, bumping into the sides like blinkered horses. we held the
canoes and they crouched out from under, they were pink and breathless.
â€œbetter be fish in there,â€ david said, sleeving off his forehead.
â€œthe next oneâ€™s shorter,â€ i told them.
the water was covered with lily pads, the globular yellow lilies with their thick
centre snouts pushing up from among them. it swarmed with leeches, i could see
them undulating sluggishly under the brown surface. when the

on the way across, gas bubbles from decomposing vegetation rose and burst with a
stench of rotten eggs or farts. the air fogged with mosquitoes.
we reached the second portage, marked by a trapperâ€™s blaze weathered to the
colour of the tree. i got out and stood holding the canoe steady while joe climbed
forward.
it was behind me, i smelled it before i saw it; then i heard the flies. the smell was
like decaying fish. i turned around and it was hanging upside down by a thin blue
nylon rope tied round its feet and looped over a tree branch, its wings fallen open. it
looked at me with its mashed eye.

â€œheavy,â€ david said. â€œwhat is it?â€
â€œa dead bird,â€ anna said. she held her nose with two fingers.
i said â€œitâ€™s a heron. you canâ€™t eat them.â€ i couldnâ€™t te

bullet, smashed with a stone, hit with a stick. this would be a good place for herons,
they would come to fish in the shallow water, standing on one leg and striking with
the long spear bill. they must have got it before it had time to rise.
â€œwe need that,â€ david said, â€œwe can put it next to the fish guts.â€
â€œshit,â€ joe said, â€œit really stinks.â€
â€œthat wonâ€™t show in the movie,â€ david said, â€œyou can stand it for five minutes, it
looks so great, you have to admit.â€ they began to set up the camera; anna and i
waited, sitting on the packs.
i saw a beetle on it, blueblack and oval; when the camera whirred it burrowed in
under the feathers. carrion beetle, death beetle. why had they strung it up like a
lynch victim, why didnâ€™t they just throw it away like the trash? to prove they could
do it, they had

s at the distant end of the lake: their bunker. binoculars trained on
me, i could feel the eye rays, cross of the rifle sight on my forehead, in case i made
a false move.
david was impatient, he wanted his moneyâ€™s worth, what heâ€™d come for. anna
said sheâ€™d stay at the campsite: fishing didnâ€™t interest her. we left her the insect spray
and the three of us got into the green canoe with the fishing rods. i put the frog jar in
the stern where i could reach it. david was facing me this time; joe sat in the bow, he
was going to fish too, though he didnâ€™t have a licence.
the wind had dwindled, the lake was pink and orange. we went along the shore,
birches cool, overhanging us, ice pillars. i was dizzy, too much water and sun glare,
the skin of my face was shimmering as though burned, afterglow. in my head when i
closed my eyes the shape of the heron dangled, upside down. i should have buried it.
the canoe steered over to the nearest beaver lodge and they tied up to it. i opened

all whatâ€™s important to you, what youâ€™re hunting. they had
enough food, no need to draw tinned peas and argentine corned beef, and thatâ€™s
what they wanted instead during those monotonous and not at all idyllic trips up and
down the lake, nothing to do but play cards, they must have detested it, back and
forth chained to the logs. all of them dead now or old, they probably hated each
other.
the bass struck on both lines at once. they fought hard, the rods doubled over.
david landed one but joe let his escape into the labyrinth of sticks, where it wound
the line around a branch and snapped it.
â€œhey,â€ david was saying, â€œkill it for me.â€ the bass was fierce, it was flipping
around the inside of the canoe. it spat water from its undershot jaw with a hissing
sound; it was either terrified or enraged, i couldnâ€™t tell which.
â€œyou do it,â€ i said, handing him the knife. â€œi showed you how, remember?â€

and a frog, exhaling ether, spread and pinned flat as a doily and slit open, the organs
explored and clipped out, the detached heart still gulping slowly like an adamâ€™s
apple, no martyrâ€™s letters on it, the intestines messy string. pickled cat pumped full
of plastic, red for the arteries, blue for the veins, at the hospital, the undertakerâ€™s.
find the brain of the worm, donate your body to science. anything we could do to
the animals we could do to each other: we practised on them first.
joe flipped his broken line back to me and i rummaged among the lures and
found another leader, a lead sinker, another hook: accessory, accomplice.
the americans had rounded the point, two of them in a silver canoe; they were
barging towards us. i assessed them, their disguises: they werenâ€™t the bloated
middle-aged kind, those would stick to powerboats and guides; they were younger,
trimmer, with the candid, tanned astronaut finish valued by the magazines. when
they were even with us their mouths

she would laugh about it but the story seemed to me then chilly and sad, the failure
unbearable.
â€œsometimes i think heâ€™d like me to die,â€ anna said, â€œi have dreams about it.â€
we walked back and i built up the fire and mixed some cocoa, using powdered
milk. everything was dark now except for the flames, sparks going up in spirals,
coals underneath pulsing red when the night breeze hit them. we sat on the
groundsheets, david with his arm around anna, joe and i a foot apart.
â€œthis reminds me of girl guides,â€ anna said in the cheerful voice i once thought
was hers. she began to sing, the notes hesitant, quavering:
thereâ€™ll be bluebirds over
the white cliffs of dover
tomorrow, when the worldis free. â€¦
the words went out towards the shadows, smoke-thin, evaporating. across the lake
a barred owl was calling, quick and soft like a wing beating against the eardrum,
cutting across the pattern of her voice, negating her. she glanced behind her:

â€œnow everybody sing,â€ she said, clapping her hands.
david said â€œwell, goodnight children,â€ and he and anna went into their tent. the
tent lit up from inside for a moment, flashlight, then went out.
â€œcoming?â€ joe said.
â€œin a minute.â€ i wanted to give him time to go to sleep.
i sat in the dark, the stroking sound of the night lake surrounding me. in the
distance the americansâ€™ campfire glowed, a dull red cyclops eye: the enemy lines. i
wished evil towards them: let them suffer, i prayed, tip their canoe, burn them, rip
them open. owl: answer, no answer.
i crawled into the tent through the mosquito-netting; i groped for the flashlight
but didnâ€™t switch it on, i didnâ€™t want to disturb him. i undr

 but he turned over away from me, muffling himself in the sleeping bag.
my heart bumped, i held still, translating the noises on the other side of the canvas
wall. squeaks, shuffling in the dry leaves, grunting, nocturnal animals; no danger.
chapter fifteen
the tent roof was translucent, wet parchment, spotted on the outside with early dew.
bird voices twirled over my ears, intricate as skaters or running water, the air
filling with liquid syllables.
in the middle of the night there was a roar, joe having a nightmare. i touched him,
it was safe, he was trapped in the straitjacket sleeping bag. he sat up, not yet awake.
â€œthis is the wrong room,â€ he said.
â€œwhat was it?â€ i asked. â€œwhat were you dreaming?â€ i wanted to know, perhaps i
could remember how. but he folded over and went back.
my hand was beside me; it had the cured hide smell of wood-smoke mingled with
sweat and earth, fish lingering, smell of the past. at the cabin we would soak the
clothes weâ€™d been wearing, scrub t

 dead.
i looked for a dip in the shore, a line that would fit the mapline. it was there, site
of the x, unmistakable: cliff with sheer face, the kind they would have chosen to
paint on, no other flat rock in sight. he had been here and long before him the
original ones, the first explorers, leaving behind them their sign, word, but not its
meaning. i leaned forward, scanning the cliff surface; we let the canoes drift in
sideways till they scraped the stone.
â€œwhere is it?â€ david said; and to joe, â€œyouâ€™ll have to steady the canoe, thereâ€™s no
way we can shoot from land.â€
â€œit might be hard to see at first,â€ i said, â€œfaded. it ought to be right here
somewhere.â€ but it wasnâ€™t: no man with antlers, nothing like red paint or even a
stain, the rock surface extended under my hand, coarsegrained, lunar, broken only
by a pink-white vein of quartz that ran across it, a diagonal marking the slow tilt of
the land; nothing human.

the cabin there had been no camera. no drawings, no camera, iâ€™d done it wrong, i
would have to look again.
they were disappointed, theyâ€™d expected something picturesque or bizarre,
something they could utilize. he hadnâ€™t followed the rules, heâ€™d cheated, i wanted to
confront him, demand an explanation: you said it would be here.
we turned back. the americans were up, they were still alive; they were setting
out in their canoe, the front one had his fishing rod trailing over the bow. joe and i
were ahead, we approached them at right angles.
â€œhi,â€ the front one said, to me, bleached grin. â€œany luck?â€ that was their armour,
bland ignorance, heads empty as weather balloons: with that they could defend
themselves against anything. straight power, they mainlined it; i imagined the surge
of electricity, nerve juice, as they hit it, brought it down, flapping like a crippled
plane. the innocents get slaughtered because they exist, i thought, there is nothing

pulled on a sweat shirt in case there were americans. before leaving i searched
once more for his camera, the one he must have used to take the photographs, but it
wasnâ€™t there; he must have had it with him. at the time, the last time.
i had started down the steps before i saw them. the three of them were on the
dock, split into parts by the treetrunk bars. anna was kneeling in her orange bikini,
with a towel draped over her head like a nun; david was standing over her, hands on
hips. joe was further back with the movie camera, sitting on the dock with his legs
dangling, head averted as if waiting politely for them to be through. when i heard
what they were saying i stood still. the canoes were there and i needed one of them
but it was too dangerous. it was a calm day, the sound carried.
â€œcome on, take it off,â€ david said; his light-humour voice.
â€œi wasnâ€™t bothering you.â€ anna was muted, avoiding.
â€œit wonâ€™t hurt you, we need a naked lady.â€
â€œwhat the hell for?â€

pretended to read.
â€œcome on, we need a naked lady with big tits and a big ass,â€ david said in the
same tender voice; i recognized that menacing gentleness, at school it always went
before the trick, the punchline.
â€œlook, will you leave me alone?â€ anna said. â€œiâ€™m minding my own business,
mind yours why donâ€™t you.â€ she stood up, her towel sliding off, and tried to get past
him to the land, but he sidestepped in front of her.
â€œi wonâ€™t take her if she doesnâ€™t want to,â€ joe said.
â€œitâ€™s token resistance,â€ david said, â€œshe wants to, sheâ€™s an exhibitionist at heart.
she likes her lush bod, donâ€™t you? even if she is getting too fat.â€
â€œdonâ€™t think i donâ€™t know what youâ€™re trying to do,â€ anna said, as though sheâ€™d
guessed a riddle. â€œyouâ€™re trying to humiliate me.â€
â€œwhatâ€™s humiliating about your body, darling?â€ david said caressingly. â€œwe all
love it, you ashamed of it? thatâ€™s pretty stingy of you, you should share the wealth;

anna was furious now, goaded, her voice rose. â€œfuck off, you want bloody
everything donâ€™t you, you canâ€™t use that stuff on me.â€
â€œwhy not,â€ david said evenly, â€œit works. now just take it off like a good girl or
iâ€™ll have to take it off for you.â€
â€œleave her alone,â€ joe said, swinging his legs, bored or excited, it was
impossible to tell.
i wanted to run down to the dock and stop them, fighting was wrong, we werenâ€™t
allowed to, if we did both sides got punished as in a real war. so we battled in secret,
undeclared, and after a while i no longer fought back because i never won. the only
defence was flight, invisibility. i sat down on the top step.
â€œshut up, sheâ€™s my wife,â€ david said. his hand clamped down above her elbow.
she jerked away, then i saw hi

s arms go around her as if to kiss her and she was in
the air, upside down over his shoulder, hair hanging in damp ropes. â€œokay

annaâ€™s fists grabbed bunches of his shirt. â€œif i go in, you go in too.â€ the words
spurted from behind her fallen hair, she was kicking, i couldnâ€™t see whether she was
laughing or crying.
â€œshoot,â€ david said to joe, and to anna, â€œiâ€™ll count to ten.â€
joe swivelled the camera and trained it on them like a bazooka or a strange
instrument of torture and pressed the button, lever, sinister whirr.
â€œall right,â€ anna said under its coercion, â€œyou shmuck bastard, god damn you.â€
he set her down and stepped aside. her arms, elbows out, struggled with the fastener
like a beetleâ€™s on its back and the top dropped away: i saw her cut in half, one breast
on either side of a thin tree.
â€œbottoms too,â€ david said as though to a recalcitrant child.

anna stood for a moment, brown-red with yellow fur and white markings like
underwear, glaring at them. then she stuck her middle finger in the air at them and
ran to the end of the dock and jumped into the lake. it was a bellyflop, the water
splattered out like a dropped egg. she came up with her hair in streaks over her
forehead and started to swim around towards the sand point, clumsy, arms flailing.
â€œget that?â€ david said mildly over his shoulder.
â€œsome of it,â€ joe said. â€œmaybe you could order her to do it again.â€ i thought he
was being sarcastic but i wasnâ€™t sure. he began to unscrew the camera from the
tripod.
i could hear anna splashing and then stumbling below on the sand point; she was
really crying now, her indrawn breaths rasping. the bushes rustled, she swore; then
she appeared over the top of the hill, she must have climbed up by holding on to the
leaning trees. her pink face was dissolving, her skin was covered with sand and pine
needles l

one at a time they were safer; i went down for the canoe.
â€œhi,â€ he said, â€œhow goes it?â€ he didnâ€™t know iâ€™d been watching. he had his shoes
off and was picking at a toenail as though nothing had happened.
david is like me, i thought, we are the ones that donâ€™t know how to love, there is
something essential missing in us, we were born that way, madame at the store with
one hand, atrophy of the heart. joe and anna are

 out of my mouth in silver, panic closing my throat, the
scream kept in and choking me. the green canoe was far above me, sunlight
radiating around it, a beacon, safety.
but there was not one canoe, there were two, the canoe had twinned or i was
seeing double. my hand came out of the water and i gripped the gunwale, then my
head; water ran from my nose, i gulped breath, stomach and lungs contracting, my
hair sticky like weeds, the lake was horrible, it was filled with death, it was touching
me.
joe was in the other canoe. â€œhe told me you went over this way,â€ he said. he must
have been almost there before i dived but i hadnâ€™t seen him. i couldnâ€™t say anything,
my lungs were urgent, my arms would hardly pull me into the canoe.
â€œwhat the hell are you doing?â€ he said.
i lay on the bottom of the canoe and closed my eyes; i wanted him not to be there.
it formed again in my head: at first i thought it was my drowned brother, hair
floating around the face, image iâ€™d kept from before

they never knew, about that or why i left. their own innocence, the reason i
couldnâ€™t tell them; perilous innocence, closing them in glass, their artificial garden,
greenhouse. they didnâ€™t teach us about evil, they didnâ€™t understand about it, how
could i describe it to them? they were from another age, prehistoric, when
everyone got married and had a family, children growing in the yard like
sunflowers; remote as eskimoes or mastodons.
i opened my eyes and sat up. joe was still there beside me; he was holding on to
the edge of my canoe.
â€œyou all right?â€ he said. his voice came to me faintly, as though muffled.
he said i should do it, he made me do it; he talked about it as though it was legal,
simple, like getting a wart removed. he said it wasnâ€™t a person, only an animal; i
should have seen that was no different, it was hiding in me as if in a burrow and
instead of granting it sanctuary i let them catch it. i could have said no but i didnâ€™t;

truth. there was no painting at white
birch lake and none here, because his later drawings werenâ€™t copied from things on
the rocks. he had discovered new places, new oracles, they were things he was
seeing the way i had seen, true vision; at the end, after the failure of logic. when it
happened the first time he must have been terrified, it would be like stepping
through a usual door and finding yourself in a different galaxy, purple trees and red
moons and a green sun.
i swung the paddle and joeâ€™s hand came unstuck and the canoe went towards the
shore. i slipped on my canvas shoes and bundled up the sweatshirt and stepped out,
looping the rope to a tree, then i climbed the slope towards the cliff, trees on one
side, rockface on the other, balsam smell, underbrush scratching my bare legs.
there was a ledge, iâ€™d noticed it from the lake, i could throw my sweatshirt onto it. i
didnâ€™t know the names of the ones i was making the offering to; but they were there,
they had power. candle

ished-for and partial.
clothing was better, it was closer and more essential; and the gift had been greater,
more than a hand or an eye, feeling was beginning to seep back into me, i tingled
like a foot thatâ€™s been asleep.
i was opposite the ledge; reindeer moss feathered it, clumps intricate with
branches, the tips red, glowing in the sun. it was only an armâ€™s length away on the
sheer cliff; i folded my sweatshirt neatly and reached it across.
behind me something lumbered, crashing. it was joe, iâ€™d forgotten about him.
when he caught up with me he took me by the shoulders.
â€œyou all right?â€ he said again.
i didnâ€™t love him, i was far away from him, it was as though i was seeing him
through a smeared window or glossy paper; he didnâ€™t belong here. but he existed,
he deserved to be alive. i was wishing i could tell him how to change so he could get
there, the place where i was.
â€œyes,â€ i said. i touched him on the arm with my hand. my hand touched his arm.
hand touched arm.

a groovy chick, you

pulled me over towards him; his neck was creased and freckled, soon he would have
jowls, he smelled like scalp. his moustache whisked my face.
i twisted away and stood up. â€œwhy are you doing this?â€ i said. â€œyouâ€™re
interfering.â€ i wiped at my arm where he had touched it.
he didnâ€™t understand what i meant, he smiled even harder. â€œdonâ€™t get uptight,â€ he
said, â€œi wonâ€™t tell joe. itâ€™ll be great, itâ€™s good for you, keeps you healthy.â€ then he
went â€œyuk, yukâ€ like goofy.
he was speaking about it as though it was an exercising programme, athletic
demonstration, ornamental swimming in a chlorine swimming pool noplace in
california. â€œit wouldnâ€™t keep me healthy,â€ i said, â€œiâ€™d get pregnant.â€
he lifted his eyebrows, incredulous. â€œyouâ€™re putting me on,â€ he said, â€œthis is the

â€œno it isnâ€™t,â€ i said. â€œnot here.â€

mottled pink, turkey neck, but his voice was still rational. â€œlisten,â€ he said, â€œi

joe is; heâ€™s not so noble, heâ€™s off in the bushes somewhere with that cunt on four
legs, right about now heâ€™s shoving it into her.â€ he glanced quickly at his wristwatch
as though timing them; he seemed elated by what heâ€™d said, his eyes gleamed like
test-tubes.
â€œoh,â€ i said; i thought about it for a minute. â€œmaybe they love each other.â€ it
would be logical, they were the ones who could. â€œdo you love me,â€ i asked in case i
hadnâ€™t understood him, â€œis that why you want me to?

right?â€ if heâ€™d succeeded he would have told her as soon as he could. â€œi respect you
for it, i really do.â€
â€œthatâ€™s all right,â€ i said; i knew he was lying.
they sat around the table in the regular places and i served dinner. there hadnâ€™t
been any lunch but no one mentioned that.
â€œwhat time is evans coming tomorrow?â€ i said.
â€œten, ten-thirty,â€ david said. â€œhave a nice afternoon?â€ he said to anna. joe stuck
a new potato with his fork and put it into his mouth.
â€œfantastic,â€ anna said. â€œi got some sun and finished my book, then i had a long
talk with joe and went for a stroll.â€ joe chewed, his closed mouth moving, silent
refutation. â€œand you?â€
â€œgreat,â€ david said, his voice buoyant, inflated. he bent his arm onto the table,
his hand brushing mine casually, as though by accident, for her to see. i flinched
away, he was lying about me, the animals donâ€™t lie.

i didnâ€™t want to join. â€œitâ€™s not what you think,â€ i said to anna. â€œhe asked me to but
i wouldnâ€™t.â€ i wanted to tell her i hadnâ€™t acted against her.
her eyes flicked from him to me. â€œthat was pure of you,â€ she said. iâ€™d made a
mistake, she resented me because i hadnâ€™t given in, it commented on her.
â€œsheâ€™s pure all right,â€ david said, â€œsheâ€™s a little purist.â€
â€œjoe told me she wonâ€™t put out for him any more,â€ anna said, still looking at me.
joe didnâ€™t say anything; he was eating another potato.
â€œshe hates men,â€ david said lightly. â€œeither that or she wants to be one. right?â€

there were two men, police or probably game wardens, they were wearing
ordinary clothes; and a third man, blond, claude from the village probably, and a
fourth one, older, the size of paul. it was odd that paul was on the launch: if he were
coming for a visit he would bring his own boat. david shook hands with them and
they clustered on the dock, talking in low voices. david dug into his pocket, for the
licence; then he scratched his neck as if worried. joe appeared from the outhouse
path and the talking started over again; annaâ€™s head turned up towards me.
then i saw david hurrying, taking the hill steps two at a time. the screen door
banged shut behind him. â€œthey found your father,â€ he said, breathing hard from the
climb. he squinted his face, as if to show sympathy.
the door slammed again, it was anna; he put his arm around her and they both
studied me with the intent pouncing look theyâ€™d had at supper.

they gained or lost. joe sat in the corner on the bench, i could hear him scuffling
against the wall.

her face like a visor.
â€œi thought iâ€™d do it,â€ she says, â€œso you two could sleep in.â€ she must have heard
the door opening and closing in the night; she produces a smile, warm,
conspiratorial, and i know what circuits are closing in her head: by screwing joe
sheâ€™s brought us back together. saving the world, everyone wants to; men think they
can do it with guns, women with their bodies, love conquers all, conquerors love

she dishes out breakfast. itâ€™s baked beans from a can, the usual morning food is
gone.
â€œpork and beans and musical fruit, the more you eat the more you toot,â€ david
says and quacks like daffy duck, jaunty, mimicking satisfaction.
anna helps him, co-operative community life; she taps him on the k

r three weeks,â€ david says, his version of
a pro. â€œweâ€™ll take it into the lab first thing.â€
â€œthereâ€™s part of a reel left,â€ anna says. â€œyou should get her, you got me but you
never got her.â€ she looks at me, fumes ascending from her nose and mouth.
â€œnow thatâ€™s an idea,â€ david says. â€œthe rest of us are in it, sheâ€™s the only one who
isnâ€™t.â€ he assesses me. â€œwhere would we fit her in though? we donâ€™t have anyone
fucking yet; but iâ€™d have to do it,â€ he says to joe, â€œwe need you running the camera.â€
â€œi could run the camera,â€ anna says, â€œyou could both do it,â€ and everyone laughs.
they get up after a while and hoist the red canoe, one at each end, and carry it up
the hill. i stay with anna on the dock.
â€œis my nose peeling?â€ she says, rubbing it. from her handbag she takes a round
gilt compact with violets on the cover. she opens it, unclosing her other self, and
runs her fingertip around the corners of her mouth, left one, right one; then s

the canisters of film.
â€œwhatâ€™re you doing?â€ anna says, listlessly however.
i unwind the film, standing full in the sun, and let it spiral into the lake. â€œyou
better not do that,â€ anna says, â€œtheyâ€™ll kill you.â€ but she doesnâ€™t interfere, she
doesnâ€™t call them.
when iâ€™ve unravelled the reels i open the back of the camera. the film coils onto
the sand under the water, weighted down by its containers; the invisible captured
images are swimming away into the lake like tadpoles, joe and david beside their
defeated log, axemen, arms folded, anna with no clothes on jumping off the end of
the dock, finger up, hundreds of tiny naked annas no longer bottled and shelved.
i study her to see if her release has made any difference, but the green eyes regard
me unaltered from the enamel face. â€œtheyâ€™ll get you,â€ she says, doleful as a
prophet. â€œyou shouldnâ€™t have done it.â€
theyâ€™re at the top of the hill now, coming back for the other canoe. i run quickly
towards it, fli

step in, shove.
â€œshe dumped out your film,â€ anna says behind me.
i push the blade into the water, i donâ€™t turn, i can hear them peering down into the
lake.
â€œshit,â€ david says, â€œshit, shit, oh shit, why the shit didnâ€™t you stop her?â€
when iâ€™m as far as the sand point i look back. anna stands, arms slack at her sides,
uninvolved; david is kneeling, his hands fishing in the water, pulling up the film in
spaghetti handfuls though he must know itâ€™s futile, everything has escaped.
joe is not there. he appears then at the top of the sand cliff, running, halting. he
yells my name, furiously: if he had a rock he would throw it.
the canoe glides, carrying the two of us, around past the leaning trees and out of
range. itâ€™s too late for them to get the other canoe and follow; probably they havenâ€™t
thought of it, surprise attacks work by confusing. the direction is clear. i see iâ€™ve
been planning this, for how long i canâ€™t tell.
i go along near the trees, boat and arms one

explaining, theyâ€™ll have to invent some reason, accident, say why iâ€™m not with them.
they will be plotting, a strategy for recapture; or will they really go off and discard
me, vanish into the catacombs of the city, giving me up for lost, stashing me away in
their heads with all the obsolete costumes and phrases? for them iâ€™ll soon be ancient
as crew cuts and world war songs, a half-remembered face in a highschool
yearbook, a captured enemy medal: memorabilia, or possibly not even that.
joe comes up the steps, shouting; anna shouts too, shrill, like a train whistle
before departure, my name. itâ€™s too late, i no longer have a name. i tried for all
those years to be civilized but iâ€™m not and iâ€™m through pretending.
joe goes around to the front of the cabin, concealed from me. after a minute he
reappears, stumping back down the hill to them, shoulders sloped in defeat. perhaps
by now he understands.
they clamber into the boat. anna pauses for a moment, turned directly towards

i get to my feet slowly, my body is cramped from not moving; on the
bare flesh of my legs are the imprints of leaves and twigs.
i walk to the hill and scan the shoreline, finding the place, opening, where they
disappeared: checking, reassuring. itâ€™s true, i am by myself; this is what i wanted, to
stay here alone. from any rational point of view i am absurd; but there are no
longer any rational points of view.
chapter twenty-two
theyâ€™ve locked the doors, on the toolshed, on the cabin; it was joe, he may have
assumed iâ€™d take the canoe to the village. no, it was ill will. i shouldnâ€™t have left the
keys hanging on the nail, i should have put them in my pocket. but it was stupid of
them to think they could keep me out. soon they will reach the village, the car, the
city; what are they saying about me now? that i was running away; but to go with
them would have been running away, the truth is here.
i stand on the front step and lean sideways, clutching the window-ledge, looking
in. the

hey are talking, their voices are distinct
but they penetrate my ears as sounds only, foreign radio. it must be either english or
french but i canâ€™t recognize it as any language iâ€™ve ever heard or known. scrapes
and grunts, theyâ€™re getting in, through the door or the open window, crunch of their
boots inside on the broken glass. one of them laughs, spike scratched on slate.
the other three are still on the dock. then they shout: they must have found my
clothes, one is kneeling down. is it joe, i try to picture what joe looks like. but it
makes no difference, he wouldnâ€™t help me, he would be on their side; he may have
given them the keys.
the two come out of the cabin and thud down to the dock again, their false skins
flapping. they cluster, they chitter and sizzle like a speeded-up tape, the forks and
spoons on the ends of their arms waving excitedly. perhaps they think i drowned
myself, that would be the kind of blunder they would make.
keep quiet i say, i bite into my arm but i

canâ€™t hold it back, the laughter extrudes.
it startles me, i stop at once but itâ€™s too late, theyâ€™ve heard me. rubber feet stomping
off the dock and bulletproof heads moving towards me, who could they be, david
and joe, claude from the village, evans, malmstrom the spy, the americans, the
humans, theyâ€™re here because i wouldnâ€™t sell. i donâ€™t own it, nobody owns it i tell
them, you donâ€™t have to kill me. rabbitâ€™s choices: freeze, take the chance they wonâ€™t
see you; then bolt.
i have a good start on them and no shoes. i run silently, dodging branches,
heading for the path to the swamp, the canoe is there, i can easily reach it first. on
the open lake they could cut me off with the motorboat but if i

ws potential already in its proto-brain,
untravelled paths. no god and perhaps not real, even that is uncertain; i canâ€™t know
yet, itâ€™s too early. but i assume it: if i die it dies, if i starve it starves with me. it
might be the first one, the first true human; it must be born, allowed.
iâ€™m outside in the garden when the boat comes. it isnâ€™t evans; itâ€™s paulâ€™s boat,
thick and slow and painted white, he built it himself. paul is at the back, beside the
antique motor; in the front is joe.
i go out through the gate and retreat behind the trees, white birches clumped
beside the path, not hurrying, not running away but cautious.
the motor cuts, the nose of the boat bumps the dock. paul stands up with an oar,
pulling in; joe gets out and ropes the boat and takes several steps towards the land.
he calls my name, then pauses, â€œare you here?â€ echo: here, here?
he must have been waiting in the village, the searchers must have told him theyâ€™d
seen me, perhaps he was with them. he
