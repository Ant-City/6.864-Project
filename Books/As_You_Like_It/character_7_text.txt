enter orlando and adam


  orlando. as i remember, adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed
    me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou say'st,
    charged my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there
    begins my sadness. my brother jaques he keeps at school, and
    report speaks goldenly of his profit. for my part, he keeps me
    rustically at home,

ully gives me, the
    something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from
    me. he lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
    brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my
    education. this is it, adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of
    my father, which i think is within me, begins to mutiny against
    this servitude. i will no longer endure it, though yet i know no
    wise remedy how to avoid it.

                           enter oliver


  adam. yonder comes my master, your brother.

  orlando. go apart, adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me
    up.                                           [adam retires]

  oliver. now, sir! what make you here?

  orlando. nothing; i am not taught to make any thing.

  oliver. what mar you then, sir?

  orlando. marry, sir, i am helping you to mar that which god made, a
    poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.

  oliver. marry, sir, be better employed, and

  orlando. shall i keep your hogs, and eat husks with them? what
    prodigal portion have i spent that i should come to such penury?

  oliver. know you where you are, sir?

  orlando. o, sir, very well; here in your orchard.

  oliver. know you before whom, sir?

  orlando. ay, better than him i am before knows me. i know you are
    my eldest brother; and in the gentle condition of blood, you
    should so know me. the courtesy of nations allows you my better
    in that you are the first-born; but the same tradition takes not
    away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us. i have as
    much of my father in me as you, albeit i confess your coming
    before me is nearer to his reverence.

  orlando. come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.

  oliver. wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?

  orlando. i am no villain; i am the youngest son of sir rowland de
    boys. he was my father; and he is thrice a villain that says such
    a father begot villains. wert thou not my brother, i would not
    take this hand from thy throat till this other had pull'd out thy
    tongue for saying so. thou has rail'd on thyself.

  adam. [coming forward] sweet masters, be patient; for your father's
    remembrance, be at accord.

  oliver. let me g

 i say.

  orlando. i will not, till i please; you shall hear me. my father
    charg'd you in his will to give me good education: you have
    train'd me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all
    gentleman-like qualities. the spirit of my father grows strong in
    me, and i will no longer endure it; therefore allow me such
    exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor
    allottery my father left me by testament; with that i will go buy
    my fortunes.

  oliver. and what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent? well, sir,
    get you in. i will not long be troubled with you; you shall have
    some part of your will. i pray you leave me.

  orlando. i no further offend you than becomes me for my good.

  oliver. get you with him, you old dog.

  adam. is 'old dog' my reward? most true, i have lost my teeth in
    your service. god be with my old master! he would not have spoke
    such a word.

  dennis. calls your worship?

  oliver. not charles, the duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?

  dennis. so please you, he is here at the door and importunes access

    to-morrow the wrestling is.

  charles. good morrow to your worship.

  oliver. good monsieur charles! what's the new news at the new
    court?

  charles. there's no news at the court, sir, but the old news; that
    is, the old duke is banished by his younger brother the new duke;
    and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary
    exile with him, whose land

s and revenues enrich the new duke;
    therefore he gives them good leave to wander.

  oliver. can you tell if rosalind, the duke's daughter, be banished
    with her father?

  charles. o, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves her,
    being ever from their cradles bred together, that she would have
    followed her exile, or have died to stay behind her. she is at
    the court, and no less beloved of her uncle than his own
    daughter; and never two ladies loved as they do.

  oliver. where will the old duke live?

  charles. they say he is already in the fore

st of arden, and a many
    merry men with him; and there they live like the old robin hood
    of england. they say many young gentlemen flock to him every day,
    and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden world.

  oliver. what, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?

  charles. marry, do i, sir; and i came to acquaint you with a
    matter. i am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger
    brother, orlando, hath a disposition to come in disguis'd against
    me to try a fall. to-morrow, sir, i wrestle for my credit; and he
    that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well.
    your brother is but young and tender; and, for your love, i would
    be loath to foil him, as 
 
 ___________________________
 
i must, for my own honour, if he come
    in; therefore, out of my love to you, i came hither to acquaint
    you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment,
    or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is
    thing of his own search and altogether against my will.

  oliver. charles, i thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt
    find i will most kindly requite. i had myself notice of my
    brother's purpose herein, and have by underhand means laboured to
    dissuade him from it; but he is resolute. i'll tell thee,
    charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of france; full of
    ambition, an envious emulator of every man's good parts, a secret
    and villainous contriver against me his natural brother.
    therefore use thy discretion: i had

 or other; for, i
    assure thee, and almost with tears i speak it, there is not one
    so young and so villainous this day living. i speak but brotherly
    of him; but should i anatomize him to thee as he is, i must blush
    and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder.

  charles. i am heartily glad i came hither to you. if he come
    to-morrow i'll give him his payment. if ever he go alone again,
    i'll never wrestle for prize more. and so, god keep your worship!

 exit

  oliver. farewell, good charles. now will i stir this gamester.
    i hope i shall see an end of him; for my soul, yet i know not why,
    hates nothing more than he. yet he's gentle; never school'd and
    yet learned; full of noble device; of all sorts enchantingly
    beloved; and, indeed, so much in the heart of the world, and
    especially of my own people, who best know him, that i am
    altogether misprised. but it shall not be so long; this wrestler
    shall clear all. nothing remains

    sluttishness may come hereafter. but be it as it may be, i will

    a sheep-cote fenc'd about with olive trees?

  celia. west of this place, down in the neighbour bottom.
    the rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
    left on your right hand brings you to the place.
    but at this hour the house doth keep itself;
    there's none within.

  oliver. if that an eye may profit by a tongue,
    then should i know you by description-

  such garments, and such years: 'the boy is fair,
    of female favour, and bestows himself
    like a ripe sister; the woman low,
    and browner than her brother.' are not you
    the owner of the house i did inquire for?

  celia. it is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.

  oliver. orlando doth commend him to you both;
    and to that youth he calls his rosalind
    he sends this bloody napkin. are you he?

  rosalind. i am. what must we understand by this?

  oliver. some of my shame; if you will know of me
    what man i am, and how, and why, and where,
    this handkercher was stain'd.

  celia. i pray you, tell it.

  oliver. when last the young orlando parted from you,
    he left a promise to return again
    within an hour; and, pacing through the forest,
    chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,
    lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,
    and mark what object did present itself.
    under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with

which bush's shade
    a lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
    lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,
    when that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis
    the royal disposition of that beast
    to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.
    this seen, orlando did approach the man,
    and found it was his brother, his elder brother.

  celia. o, i have heard him speak of that same brother;
    and he did render him the most unnatural
    that liv'd amongst men.

  oliver. and well he might so do,
    for well i know he was unnatural.

  rosalind. but, to orlando: did he leave him there,
    food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?

  oliver. twice did he turn his back, and purpos'd so;
    but kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
    and nature, stronger than his just occasion,
    made him give battle to the lioness,
    who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling
    from miserable slumber i awak'd.

  celia. are you his brother?

    to tell you what i was, since my conversion
    so sweetly tastes, being the thing i am.

  rosalind. but for the bloody napkin?

  oliver. by and by.
    when from the first to last, betwixt us two,
    tears our recountments had most kindly bath'd,
    as how i came into that desert place-
    in brief, he led me to the gentle duke,
    who gave me fresh array and entertainment,
    committing me unto my brother's love;
    who led me instantly unto his cave,
    there stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm
    the lioness had torn some flesh away,
    which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,
    and cried,

    and, after some small space, being strong at heart,
    he sent me hither, stranger as i am,
    to tell this story, that you might excuse
    his broken promise, and to give this napkin,
    dy'd in his blood, unto the shepherd youth
    that he in sport doth call his rosalind.

    i pray you, will you take him by the arm?

    you lack a man's heart.

    this was well counterfeited. i pray you tell your brother how
    well i counterfeited. heigh-ho!

  oliver. this was not counterfeit; there is too great testimony in
    your complexion that it was a passion of earnest.

  rosalind. counterfeit, i assure you.

  oliver. well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.

  rosalind. so i do; but, i' faith, i should have been a woman by
    right.

    good sir, go with us.

    how you excuse my brother, rosalind.

    your patience and your virtue well deserves it.

    [to oliver] you to your land, and love, and great allies
