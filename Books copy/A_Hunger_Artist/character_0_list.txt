The Hunger Artist - 
                The miserable protagonist of the story. Dressed in black tights, the hunger artist is emaciated. Everything about his demeanor cries of desperation and tragedy. He sequesters himself in a cage, preferring to sit on the straw-lined floor rather than on a chair. Although he craves public attention and is delighted to display himself to wide-eyed spectators, he is often frustrated with the interactions he has with others.
