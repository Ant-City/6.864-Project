hazelle nods. “that'd be good. gale means to, but he's only got his sundays, and i think 

he likes saving those for you.” 

i  can't  stop  the  redness  that  floods  my  cheeks.  it's  stupid,  of  course.  hardly  anybody

that i love peeta mellark. 

i can't do it, i think. i'm not that good. peeta's the good one, the likable one. he can make 
people believe anything. i'm the one who shuts up and sits back and lets him do as much of 
the talking as possible. but it isn't peeta who has to prove his devotion. it's me. 

i hear my mother's light, quick tread in the hall. she can't know, i think. not about any of 
this. i reach my hands over the tray and quickly brush the bits of cookie from my palm and 
fingers. i take a shaky sip of my tea
