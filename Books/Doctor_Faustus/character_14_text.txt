     chorus. learned faustus,
     to know the secrets of astronomy[112]
     graven in the book of jove's high firmament,
     did mount himself to scale olympus' top,
     being seated in a chariot burning bright,
     drawn by the strength of yoky dragons' necks.
     he now is gone to prove cosmography,
     and, as i guess, will first arrive at rome,
     to see the pope and manner of his court,
     and take some part of holy peter's feast,
     that to this day is highly solemniz'd.

     faustus. having now, my good mephistophilis,
     pass'd with delight the stately town of trier,[114]
     environ'd round with airy mountain-tops,
     with walls of flint, and deep-entrenched lakes,
     not to be won by any conquering prince;

     faustus. now, by the kingdoms of infernal rule,
     of styx, of[120] acheron, and the fiery lake
     of ever-burning phlegethon, i swear
     that i do long to see the monuments
     and situation of bright-splendent rome:
     come, therefore, let's away.

     mephist. nay, faustus, stay:  i know you'd fain see the pope,
     and take some part of holy peter's feast,
     where thou shalt see a troop of bald-pate friars,
     whose summum bonum is in belly-cheer.

     faustus. well, i'm content to compass then some sport,
     and by their folly make us merriment.
     then charm me, that i[121]
     may be invisible, to do what i please,
     unseen of any whilst i stay in rome.

     forward and backward, to curse faustus to hell!
