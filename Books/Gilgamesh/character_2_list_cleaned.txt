[CHARACTER] - 
                    the
temple prostitute who tames enkidu by seducing him away from his
natural state. though [CHARACTER]'s power comes from her sexuality,
it is associated with civilization rather than nature. she represents
the sensuous refinements of culture--the sophisticated pleasures
of lovemaking, food, alcohol, music, clothing, architecture, agriculture,
herding, and ritual.
