the departure of boromir

aragorn sped on up the hill. every now and again he bent to the ground. hobbits go light, and their footprints are not easy even for a ranger to read, but not far from the top a spring crossed the path, and in the wet earth he saw what he was seeking.
'i read the signs aright,' he said to himself. 'frodo ran to the hill-top. i wonder what he saw there? but he returned by the same way, and went down the hill again.'
aragorn hesitated. he desired to go to the high seat himself, hoping to see the

even as he gazed his quick ears caught sounds in the woodlands below, on the west side of the river. he stiffened. there were cries, and among them, to his horror, he could distinguish the harsh voices of orcs. then suddenly with a deep-throated call a great horn blew, and the blasts of it smote the hills and echoed in the hollows, rising in a mighty shout above the roaring of the falls.
'the horn of boromir!' he cried. 'he is in need!' he sprang down the steps and away, leaping down the path. 'alas! an ill fate is on me this day, and all that i do goes amiss. where is sam?'
as he ran the cries came louder, but fainter now and desperately the horn was blowing. fierce and shrill rose the yells of the orcs, and suddenly the horn-calls ceased. aragorn raced down the last slope, but before he could reach the hill's foot, the sounds died away; and as he turned to the left and ran towards them they retre

ated, until at last he could hear them no more. drawing his bright sword and crying elendil! elendil! he crashed through the trees.
a mile, maybe, from parth galen in a little glade not far from the lake he found boromir. he was sitting with his back to a great tree, as if he was resting. but aragorn saw that he was pierced with many black-feathered arrows; his sword was still in his hand, but it was broken near the hilt; his horn cloven in two was at his side. many orcs lay slain, piled all about him and at his feet.
aragorn knelt beside him. boromir opened his eyes and strove to speak. at last slow words came. 'i tried to take the ring from frodo ' he said. 'i am sorry. i have paid.' his glance strayed to his

 fallen enemies; twenty at least lay there. 'they have gone: the halflings: the orcs have taken them. i think they are not dead. orcs bound them.' he paused and his eyes closed wearily. after a moment he spoke again.
'farewell, aragorn! go to minas tirith and save my people! i have failed.'
'no!' said aragorn, taking his hand and kissing his brow. 'you have conquered. few have gained such a victory. be at peace! minas tirith shall not fall!'
boromir smiled.
'which way did they go? was frodo there?' said aragorn.
but boromir did not speak again.
'alas!' said aragorn. 'thus passes the heir of denethor, lord of the tower of guard! this is a bitter end. now the company is all in ruin. it is i that have failed. vain was gandalf's trust in me. what shall i do now? boromir has laid it on me to go to minas tirith, and my heart desires it; but where are the ring and the bearer? how shall i find them and save the quest from disaster?'
he knelt for a

 while, bent with weeping, still clasping boromir's hand. so it was that legolas and gimli found him. they came from the western slopes of the hill, silently, creeping through the trees as if they were hunting. gimli had his axe in hand, and legolas his long knife: all his arrows were spent. when they came into the glade they halted in amazement; and then they stood a moment with heads bowed in grief, for it seemed to them plain what had happened.
'alas!' said legolas, coming to aragorn's side. 'we have hunted and slain many orcs in the woods,

 but we should have been of more use here. we came when we heard the horn-but too late, it seems. i fear you have taken deadly hurt.'
'boromir is dead,' said aragorn. 'i am unscathed, for i was not here with him. he fell defending the hobbits, while i was away upon the hill.'
'the hobbits!' cried gimli 'where are they then? where is frodo?'
'i do not know,' answered aragorn wearily. 'before he died boromir told me that the orcs had bound them; he did not think that they were dead. i sent him to follow merry and pippin; but i did not ask him if frodo or sam were with him: not until it was too late. all that i have done today has gone amiss. what is to be done now?'
'first we must tend the fallen,' said legolas. 'we cannot leave him lying like carrion among these foul orcs.'
'but we must be swift,' said gimli. 'he would not wish us to linger. we must follow the orcs, if there is hope that any of ou

h. 'there is evil afoot in isengard, and the west is no longer safe. it is as gandalf feared: by some means the traitor saruman has had news of our journey. it is likely too that he knows of gandalf's fall. pursuers from moria may have escaped the vigilance of lórien, or they may have avoided that land and come to isengard by other paths. orcs travel fast. but saruman has many ways of learning news. do you remember the birds?'
'well, we have no time to ponder riddles,' said gimli. 'let us bear boromir away!'
'but after that we must guess the riddles, if we are to choose our course rightly,' answered aragorn.
'maybe there is no right choice,' said gimli.
taking his axe the dwarf now cut several branches. these they lashed together with bowstrings, and spread their cloaks upon the frame. upon this rough bier they carried the body of their companion to the shore, together with such trophies of his last battle as they chose to send forth with him. it was only a short way, yet they found it no ea

sy task, for boromir was a man both tall and strong.
at the water-side aragorn remained, watching the bier. while legolas and gimli hastened back on foot to parth galen. it was a mile or more, and it was some time before they came back, paddling two boats swiftly along the shore.
'there is a strange tale to tell!' said legolas. 'there are only two boats upon the bank. we could find no trace of the other.'
'have orcs been there?' asked aragorn.
'we saw no signs of them,' answered gimli. 'and orcs would have taken or

 destroyed all the boats, and the baggage as well.'
'i will look at the ground when we come there,' said aragorn.
now they laid boromir in the middle of the boat that was to bear him away. the grey hood and elven-cloak they folded and placed beneath his head. they combed his long dark hair and arrayed it upon his shoulders. the golden belt of lórien gleamed about his waist. his helm they set beside him, and across his lap they laid the cloven horn and the hilts and shards of his sword; beneath his feet they put the swords of his enemies. then fastening the prow to the stern of the other boat, they drew him out into the water.

they rowed sadly along the shore, and turning into the swift-running channel they passed the green sward of parth galen. the steep sides of tol brandir were glowing: it was now mid-afternoon. as they went south the fume of rauros rose and shimmered before them, a haze of gold. the rush and thunder of the falls shook the windless air.
sorrowfully they cast loose the funeral boat: there boromir lay, restful, peaceful, gliding upon the bosom of the flowing water. the stream took him while they held their own boat back with their paddles. he floated by them, and slowly his boat departed, waning to a dark spot against the golden light; and then suddenly it vanished. rauros roared on unchanging. the river had taken boromir son of denethor, and he was not seen again in minas tirith, standing as he used to stand upon the white tower in the morning. but in gondor in after-days it long was sa

ny mouths of anduin, out into the great sea at night under the stars.
for a while the three companions remained silent, gazing after him. then aragorn spoke. 'they will look for him from the white tower,' he said, 'but he will not return from mountain or from sea.' then slowly he began to sing:
through rohan over fen and field where the long grass grows
the west wind comes walking, and about the walls it goes.
'what news from the west, o wandering wind, do you bring to me tonight?
have you seen boromir the tall by moon or by starlight?'
'i saw him ride over seven streams, over waters wide and grey;
i saw him walk in empty lands, until he passed away
into the shadows of the north. i saw him then no more.
the north wind may have heard the horn of the son of denethor.'
'o boromir! from the high walls westward i looked afar,
but you came not from the empty lands where no men are.'
then legolas sang:
from the mouths of the sea the south wind flies, from the sandhills and the stones;
the wailing of

 the gulls it bears, and at the gate it moans.
'what news from the south, o sighing wind, do you bring to me at eve?
where now is boromir the fair? he tarries and i grieve.'
'ask not of me where he doth dwell-so many bones there lie
on the white shores and the dark shores under the stormy sky;
so many have passed down anduin to find the flowing sea.
ask of the north wind news of them the north wind sends to me!'
'o boromir! beyond the gate the seaward road runs south,
but you came not with the wailing gulls from the grey sea's mouth.'
then aragorn sang again:
from the gate of kings the north wind rides, and past the roaring falls;
and clear and cold about the tower its loud horn calls.
'what news from the north, o mighty wind, do you bring to me today?
what news of boromir the bold? for he is long away.'
'beneath amon hen i heard his cry. there many foes he fought.
his cloven shield, his broken sword, they to the

his head so proud, his face so fair, his limbs they laid to rest;
and rauros, golden rauros-falls, bore him upon its breast.'
'o boromir! the tower of guard shall ever northward gaze
to rauros, golden rauros-falls, until the end of days.'
so they ended. then they turned their boat and drove it with all the speed they could against the stream back to parth galen.
'you left the east wind to me,' said gimli, 'but i will say naught of it.'
'that is as it should be,' said aragorn. 'in minas tirith they endure the east wind, but they do not ask it for tidings. but now boromir has taken his road. and we must make haste to choose our ow

imli. 'that was a strange deed!'
'and a brave deed,' said aragorn. 'sam was right, i think. frodo did not wish to lead any friend to death with him in mordor. but he knew that he must go himself. something happened after he left us that overcame his fear and doubt.'
'maybe hunting orcs came on him and he fled,' said legolas.
'he fled, certainly,' said aragorn, 'but not, i think, from orcs.' what he thought was the cause of frodo's sudden resolve and flight aragorn did not say. the last words of boromir he long kept secret.
'well, so much at least is now clear,' said legolas: 'frodo is no longer on this side of the river: only he can have taken the boat. and sam is with him; only he would have taken his pack.'
'our choice then,' said gimli, 'is either to take the remaining boat and follow frodo, or else to follow the orcs on foot. there is little hope either way. we have already lost precious hours.'
'let me think!' said aragorn. 'and now may i make a right choice and change the evil fate of t

ly at last: the fate of the bearer is in my hands no longer. the company has played its part. yet we that remain cannot forsake our companions while we have strength left. come! we will go now. leave all that can be spared behind! we will press on by day and dark!'
they drew up the last boat and carried it to the trees. they laid beneath it such of their goods as they did not need and could not carry away. then they left parth galen. the afternoon was fading as they came back to the glade where boromir had fallen. there they picked up the trail of the orcs. it needed little skill to find.
'no other folk make such a trampling,' said legolas. 'it seems their delight to slash and beat down growing things that are not even in their way.'
'but they go with a great speed for all that,' said aragorn, 'and they do not tire. and later we may have to search for our path in hard bare lands.'
'well, after them!' said gimli. 'dwarves too can go swiftly, and they do not tire sooner than orcs. but it will b

 heartening. we do not pursue in vain.'
'let us hope that he did not pay too dearly for his boldness,' said legolas. 'come! let us go on! the thought of those merry young folk driven like cattle burns my heart.'
the sun climbed to the noon and then rode slowly down the sky. light clouds came up out of the sea in the distant south and were blown away upon the breeze. the sun sank. shadows rose behind and reached out long arms from the east. still the hunters held on. one day now had passed since boromir fell, and the orcs were yet far ahead. no longer could any sight of them be seen in the level plains.
as nightshade was closing about them aragorn halted. only twice in the day's march had they rested for a brief while, and twelve leagues now lay between them and the eastern wall where they had stood at dawn.
'we have come at last to a hard choice,' he said. 'shall we rest by night, or shall we go on while our will and strength hold?'
'unless our enemies rest also, they will leave us far behind

on. they have long been the friends of the people of gondor, though they are not akin to them. it was in forgotten years long ago that eorl the young brought them out of the north, and their kinship is rather with the bardings of dale, and with the beornings of the wood, among whom may still be seen many men tall and fair, as are the riders of rohan. at least they will not love the orcs.'
'but gandalf spoke of a rumour that they pay tribute to mordor ' said gimli.
'i believe it no more than did boromir,' answered aragorn.
'you will soon learn the truth,' said legolas. 'already they approach.'
at length even gimli could hear the distant beat of galloping hoofs. the horsemen, following the trail, had turned from the river, and were drawing near the downs. they were riding like the wind.
now the cries of clear strong voices came ringing over the fields. suddenly they swept up with a noise like thunder, and the foremost horseman swerved, passing by the foot of the hill, and leading the host back

f spears were pointed towards the strangers; and some of the horsemen had bows in hand, and their arrows were already fitted to the string. then one rode forward, a tall man, taller than all the rest; from his helm as a crest a white horsetail flowed. he advanced until the point of his spear was within a foot of aragorn's breast. aragorn did not stir.
'who are you, and what are you doing in this land?' said the rider, using the common speech of the west, in manner and tone like to the speech of boromir, man of gondor.
'i am called strider,' answered aragorn. 'i came out of the north. i am hunting orcs.'
the rider leaped from his horse. giving his spear to another who rode up and dismounted at his side, he drew his sword and stood face to face with aragorn, surveying him keenly, and not without wonder. at length he spoke again.
'at first i thought that you yourselves were orcs,' he said; 'but now i see that it is not so. indeed you know little of orcs, if you go hunting them in this fashion. t

in his living face they caught a brief vision of the power and majesty of the kings of stone. for a moment it seemed to the eyes of legolas that a white flame flickered on the brows of aragorn like a shining crown.
éomer stepped back and a look of awe was in his face. he cast down his proud eyes. 'these are indeed strange days,' he muttered. 'dreams and legends spring to life out of the grass.
'tell me, lord,' he said, 'what brings you here? and what was the meaning of the dark words? long has boromir son of denethor been gone seeking an answer, and the horse that we lent him came back riderless. what doom do you bring out of the north?'
'the doom of choice,' said aragorn. 'you may say this to théoden son of thengel: open war lies before him, with sauron or against him. none may live now as they have lived, and few shall keep what they call their own. but of these great matters we will speak later. if chance allows, i will come myself to the king. now i am in great need, and i ask for help,

uttering éothain retired, and spoke to the others. soon they drew off and left éomer alone with the three companions.
'all that you say is strange, aragorn.' he said. 'yet you speak the truth, that is plain: the men of the mark do not lie, and therefore they are not easily deceived. but you have not told all. will you not now speak more fully of your errand, so that i may judge what to do?'
'i set out from imladris, as it is named in the rhyme, many weeks ago,' answered aragorn. 'with me went boromir of minas tirith. my errand was to go to that city with the son of denethor, to aid his folk in their war against sauron. but the company that i journeyed with had other business. of that i cannot speak now. gandalf the grey was our leader.'
'gandalf!' éomer exclaimed. 'gandalf greyhame is known in the mark: but his name, i warn you, is no longer a password to the king's favour. he has been a guest in the land many times in the memory of men, coming as he will, after a season, or after many yea

h not to all, as you may find, if you come to the king.'
'it is tidings more grievous than any in this land can understand, though it may touch them sorely ere the year is much older,' said aragorn. 'but when the great fall, the less must lead. my part it has been to guide our company on the long road from moria. through lórien we came - of which it were well that you should learn the truth ere you speak of it again - and thence down the leagues of the great river to the falls of rauros. there boromir was slain by the same orcs whom you destroyed.'
'your news is all of woe!' cried éomer in dismay. 'great harm is this death to minas tirith, and to us all. that was a worthy man! all spoke his praise. he came seldom to the mark, for he was ever in the wars on the east-borders; but i have seen him. more like to the swift sons of eorl than to the grave men of gondor he seemed to me, and likely to prove a great captain of his people when his time came. but we have had no word of this grief out of

s to come above the flames, while the upper branches were stooping down; the brown leaves now stood out stiff, and rubbed together like many cold cracked hands taking comfort in the warmth.
there was a silence, for suddenly the dark and unknown forest, so near at hand, made itself felt as a great brooding presence, full of secret purpose. after a while legolas spoke again.
'celeborn warned us not to go far into fangorn,' he said. 'do you know why, aragorn? what are the fables of the forest that boromir had heard?'
'i have heard many tales in gondor and elsewhere,' said aragorn, 'but if it were not for the words of celeborn i should deem them only fables that men have made as true knowledge fades. i had thought of asking you what was the truth of the matter. and if an elf of the wood does not know, how shall a man answer?'
'you have journeyed further than i,' said legolas. 'i have heard nothing of this in my own land, save only songs that tell how the onodrim, that men call ents, dwelt there l

houting--he could not remember how far or how long; and then suddenly they had crashed right into a group of orcs: they were standing listening, and they did not appear to see merry and pippin until they were almost in their arms. then they yelled and dozens of other goblins had sprung out of the trees. merry and he had drawn their swords, but the orcs did not wish to fight, and had tried only to lay hold of them, even when merry had cut off several of their arms and hands. good old merry!
then boromir had come leaping through the trees. he had made them fight. he slew many of them and the rest fled. but they had not gone far on the way back when they were attacked again. by a hundred orcs at least, some of them very large, and they shot a rain of arrows: always at boromir. boromir had blown his great horn till the woods rang, and at first the orcs had been dismayed and had drawn back; but when no answer but the echoes came, they had attacked more fierce than ever. pippin did not remember muc

h more. his last memo was of boromir leaning against a tree, plucking out an arrow; then darkness fell suddenly.
'i suppose i was knocked on the head,' he said to himself. 'i wonder if poor merry is much hurt. what has happened to boromir? why didn't the orcs kill us? where are we, and where are we going?'
he could not answer the questions. he felt cold and sick. 'i wish gandalf had never persuaded elrond to let us come,' he thought. 'what good have i been? just a nuisance: a passenger, a piece of luggage. and now i have been stolen and i am just a piece of luggage for the orcs. i hope strider or someone will come and claim us! but ought i to hope for it? won't that throw out all the plans? i wish i could get free!'

, is like a hobbit. i say he, though i hope and guess that both merry and pippin were here together. there is, however, nothing to show that for certain.'
'and how do you suppose that either of our friends came to have a hand free?' asked gimli.
'i do not know how it happened,' answered aragorn. 'nor do i know why an orc was carrying them away. not to help them to escape, we may be sure. nay, rather i think that i now begin to understand a matter that has puzzled me from the beginning: why when boromir had fallen were the orcs content with the capture of merry and pippin? they did not seek out the rest of us, nor attack our camp; but instead they went with all speed towards isengard. did they suppose they had captured the ring-bearer and his faithful comrade? i think not. their masters would not dare to give such plain orders to orcs, even if they knew so much themselves; they would not speak openly to them of the ring: they are not trusty servants. but i think the orcs had been commanded to

 said gandalf, and there was a gleam in his eye and a smile on his face. 'did he indeed? it is news to me, yet it does not surprise me. good! very good! you lighten my heart. you must tell me more. now sit by me and tell me the tale of your journey.'
the companions sat on the ground at his feet, and aragorn took up the tale. for a long while gandalf said nothing, and he asked no questions. his hands were spread upon his knees, and his eyes were closed. at last when aragorn spoke of the death of boromir and of his last journey upon the great river, the old man sighed.
'you have not said all that you know or guess, aragorn my friend,' he said quietly. 'poor boromir! i could not see what happened to him. it was a sore trial for such a man: a warrior, and a lord of men. galadriel told me that he was in peril. but he escaped in the end. i am glad. it was not in vain that the young hobbits came with us, if only for boromir's sake. but that is not the only part they have to play. they were brought t

seeing eyes, that he caught a glint of white: far away perchance the sun twinkled on a pinnacle of the tower of guard. and further still, endlessly remote and yet a present threat, there was a tiny tongue of flame.
slowly théoden sat down again, as if weariness still struggled to master him against the will of gandalf. he turned and looked at his great house. 'alas!' he said, 'that these evil days should be mine, and should come in my old age instead of that peace which i have earned. alas for boromir the brave! the young perish and the old linger, withering.' he clutched his knees with his wrinkled hands.
'your fingers would remember their old strength better, if they grasped a sword-hilt,' said gandalf.
théoden rose and put his hand to his side; but no sword hung at his belt. 'where has gríma stowed it?' he muttered under his breath.
'take this, dear lord!' said a clear voice. 'it was ever at your service.' two men had come softly up the stair and stood now a few steps from the top. éom

 me see, what is today?'
'the fifth of march in the shire-reckoning,' said aragorn. pippin made some calculations on his fingers. 'only nine days ago!' he said.1 'it seems a year since we were caught. well, though half of it was like a bad dream, i reckon that three very horrible days followed. merry will correct me, if i forget anything important: i am not going into details: the whips and the filth and stench and all that; it does not bear remembering.' with that he plunged into an account of boromir's last fight and the orc-march from emyn muil to the forest. the others nodded as the various points were fitted in with their guesses.
'here are some treasures that you let fall,' said aragorn. 'you will be glad to have them back.' he loosened his belt from under his cloak and took from it the two sheathed knives.
'well!' said merry. 'i never expected to see those again! i marked a few orcs with mine; but uglúk took them from us. how he glared! at first i thought he was going to stab me, but

gandalf had gone. he had evidently learnt a lot in a short time and was digesting it. he looked at us and said: "hm, well, i find you are not such hasty folk as i thought. you said much less than you might, and not more than you should. hm, this is a bundle of news and no mistake! well, now treebeard must get busy again."
'before he went, we got a little news out of him; and it did not cheer us up at all. but for the moment we thought more about you three than about frodo and sam, or about poor boromir. for we gathered that there was a great battle going on, or soon would be, and that you were in it, and might never come out of it.
'"huorns will help," said treebeard. then he went away and we did not see him again until this morning.
'it was deep night. we lay on top of a pile of stone, and could see nothing beyond it. mist or shadows blotted out everything like a great blanket all round us. the air seemed hot and heavy; and it was full of rustlings, creakings, and a murmur like voices passin

astonished. four tall men stood there. two had spears in their hands with broad bright heads. two had great bows, almost of their own height, and great quivers of long green-feathered arrows. all had swords at their sides, and were clad in green and brown of varied hues, as if the better to walk unseen in the glades of ithilien. green gauntlets covered their hands, and their faces were hooded and masked with green, except for their eyes, which were very keen and bright. at once frodo thought of boromir, for these men were like him in stature and bearing, and in their manner of speech.
`we have not found what we sought,' said one. `but what have we found? '
'not orcs,' said another, releasing the hilt of his sword, which he had seized when he saw the glitter of sting in frodo's hand.
`elves? ' said a third, doubtfully.
`nay! not elves,' said the fourth, the tallest, and as it appeared the chief among them. `elves do not walk in ithilien in these days. and elves are wondrous fair to look upon,

r a while. but as for us, we are hobbits of the shire, far to the north and west, beyond many rivers. frodo son of drogo is my name, and with me is samwise son of hamfast, a worthy hobbit in my service. we have come by long ways - out of rivendell, or imladris as some call it.' here faramir started and grew intent. 'seven companions we had: one we lost at moria, the others we left at parth galen above rauros: two of my kin; a dwarf there was also, and an elf, and two men. they were aragorn; and boromir, who said that he came out of minas tirith, a city in the south.'
'boromir! ' all the four men exclaimed.
'boromir son of the lord denethor?' said faramir, and a strange stern look came into his face. 'you came with him? that is news indeed, if it be true. know, little strangers, that boromir son of denethor was high warden of the white tower, and our captain-general: sorely do we miss him. who are you then, and what had you to do with him? be swift, for the sun is climbing!'

'the words are known indeed,' said faramir in astonishment. `it is some token of your truth that you also know them.'
`aragorn whom i named is the bearer of the sword that was broken,' said frodo. 'and we are the halflings that the rhyme spoke of.'
`that i see,' said faramir thoughtfully. `or i see that it might be so. and what is isildur's bane? '
`that is hidden,' answered frodo. `doubtless it wi

ould see and hear all that was going on. he watched and listened intently, ready to dash to his master's aid if needed. he could see faramir's face, which was now unmasked: it was stern and commanding, and a keen wit lay behind his searching glance. doubt was in the grey eyes that gazed steadily at frodo.
sam soon became aware that the captain was not satisfied with frodo's account of himself at several points: what part he had to play in the company that set out from rivendell; why he had left boromir; and where he was now going. in particular he returned often to isildur's bane. plainly he saw that frodo was concealing from him some matter of great importance.
'but it was at the coming of the halfling that isildur's bane should waken, or so one must read the words,' he insisted. `if then you are the halfling that was named, doubtless you brought this thing, whatever it may be, to the council of which you speak, and there boromir saw it. do you deny it? '
frodo made no answer. 'so! ' said fa

'
'no, not because i choose,' answered frodo. `it does not belong to me. it does not belong to any mortal, great or small; though if any could claim it, it would be aragorn son of arathorn, whom i named, the leader of our company from moria to rauros.'
'why so, and not boromir, prince of the city that the sons of elendil founded? '
'because aragorn is descended in direct lineage, fath

a murmur of astonishment ran through all the ring of men. some cried aloud: 'the sword of elendil! the sword of elendil comes to minas tirith! great tidings! ' but faramir's face was unmoved.
`maybe,' he said. `but so great a claim will need to be established and clear proofs will be required, should this aragorn ever come to minas tirith. he had not come, nor any of your company, when i set out six days ago.'
'boromir was satisfied of that claim,' said frodo. `indeed, if boromir were here, he would answer all your questions. and since he was already at rauros many days back, and intended then to go straight to your city, if you return, you may soon learn the answers there. my part in the company was known to him, as to all the others. for it was appointed to me by elrond of imladris himself before the whole council. on that errand i came into this country, but it is not mine to reveal to any outside the comp

frodo's tone was proud, whatever he felt, and sam approved of it; but it did not appease faramir.
`so!' he said. `you bid me mind my own affairs, and get me back home, and let you be. boromir will tell all, when he comes. when he comes, say you! were you a friend of boromir?'
vividly before frodo's mind came the memory of boromir's assault upon him, and for a moment he hesitated. faramir's eyes watching him grew harder. 'boromir was a valiant member of our company ' said frodo at length. 'yes, i was his friend, for my part.'
faramir smiled grimly. `then you would grieve to learn that boromir is dead? '
'i would grieve indeed,' said frodo. then catching the look in faramir's eyes, he faltered. 'dead?' he said. `do you mean that he is dead, and that you knew it? you have been trying to trap me in words, playing with me? o

' he said. `what are you driving at? let's come to the point before all the orcs of mordor come down on us! if you think my master murdered this boromir and then ran away, you've got no sense; but say it, and have done! and then let us know what you mean to do about it. but it's a pity that folk as talk about fighting the enemy can't let others do their bit in their own way without interfering. he'd be mighty pleased, if he could see you now. think he'd got a new friend, he would.'

sam sat down heavily with a red face. faramir turned to frodo again: 'you asked how do i know that the son of denethor is dead. tidings of death have many wings. night oft brings news to near kindred, 'tis said. boromir was my brother.'
a shadow of sorrow passed over his face. `do you remember aught of special mark that the lord boromir bore with him among his gear?'
frodo thought for a moment, fearing some further trap, and wondering how this debate would turn in the end. he had hardly saved the ring from the proud grasp of boromir, and how he would fare now among so many men, warlike and strong, he did not know. yet he felt in his heart that faramir, though he was much like his brother in looks, was a man le

ss self-regarding, both sterner and wiser. 'i remember that boromir bore a horn,' he said at last.
`you remember well, and as one who has in truth seen him,' said faramir. `then maybe you can see it in your mind's eye: a great horn of the wild ox of the east, bound with silver, and written with ancient characters. that horn the eldest son of our house has borne for many generations; and it is said that if it be blown at need anywhere within the bounds of gondor, as the realm was of old, its voice will not pass unheeded.

 eleven days ago at about this hour of the day, i heard the blowing of that horn: from the northward it seemed, but dim, as if it were but an echo in the mind. a boding of ill we thought it, my father and i, for no tidings had we heard of boromir since he went away, and no watcher on our borders had seen him pass. and on the third night after another and a stranger thing befell me.
'i sat at night by the waters of anduin, in the grey dark under the young pale moon, watching the ever-moving stream; and the sad reeds were rustling. so do we ever watch the shores nigh osgiliath, which our enemies now partly hold, and issue from it to harry our lands. but that night all the world slept at the midnight hour. then i saw, or it seemed that i s

i rose and went to the bank, and began to walk out into the stream, for i was drawn towards it. then the boat turned towards me, and stayed its pace, and floated slowly by within my hand's reach, yet i durst not handle it. it waded deep, as if it were heavily burdened, and it seemed to me as it passed under my gaze that it was almost filled with clear water, from which came the light; and lapped in the water a warrior lay asleep.
`a broken sword was on his knee. i saw many wounds on him. it was boromir, my brother, dead. i knew his gear, his sword, his beloved face. one thing only i missed: his horn. one thing only i knew not: a fair belt, as it were of linked golden leaves, about his waist. boromir! i cried. where is thy horn? whither goest thou? o boromir! but he was gone. the boat turned into the stream and passed glimmering on into the night. dreamlike it was. and yet no dream, for there was no waking. and i do not doubt that he is dead and has passed down the river to the sea.'

'that was indeed boromir as i knew him. for the golden belt was given to him in lothlórien by the lady galadriel. she it was that clothed us as you see us, in elven-grey. this brooch is of the same workmanship.' he touched the green and silver leaf that fastened his cloak beneath his throat.
faramir looked closely at it. `it is beautiful,' he said. 'yes, 'tis work of the same craft. so then you passed through the land of lórien? laurelindórenan it was named of old, but long now it has lain beyond the knowledge of me

'no more can i say than i have said,' answered frodo. `though your tale fills me with foreboding. a vision it was that you saw, i think, and no more, some shadow of evil fortune that has been or will be. unless indeed it is some lying trick of the enemy. i have seen the faces of fair warriors of old laid in sleep beneath the pools of the dead marshes, or seeming so by his foul arts.'

`yet how could such a thing have happened in truth? ' asked frodo. 'for no boat could have been carried over the stony hills from tol brandir; and boromir purposed to go home across the entwash and the fields of rohan. and yet how could any vessel ride the foam of the great falls and not founder in the boiling pools, though laden with water? '
'i know not,' said faramir. 'but whence came the boat? '
`from lórien,' said frodo. 'in three such boats we rowed down anduin to the falls. they also were of elven-work.'

then turning again to frodo, he spoke in a quiet voice once more. 'to those questions i guess that you could make some answer, frodo son of drogo. but not here or now. maybe. but lest you still should think my tale a vision, i will tell you this. the horn of boromi

'and now the horn of the elder son lies in two pieces upon the lap of denethor, sitting in his high chair, waiting for news. and you can tell me nothing of the cleaving of the horn? '
'no, i did not know of it,' said frodo. `but the day when you heard it blowing, if your reckoning is true, was the day when we parted, when i and my servant left the company. and now your tale fills me with dread. for if boromir was then in peril and was slain, i must fear that all my companions perished too. and they were my kindred and my friends.
`will you not put aside your doubt of me and let me go? i am weary, and full of grief, and afraid. but i have a deed to do, or to attempt, before i too am slain. and the more need of haste, if we two halflings are all that remain of our fellowship.

e there is no comfort in our speech together,' said faramir; `but you surely draw from it more dread than need be. unless the people of lórien themselves came to him, who arrayed boromir as for a funeral? not orcs or servants of the nameless. some of your company, i guess, live still.
`but whatever befell on the north march, you, frodo, i doubt no longer. if hard days have made me any judge of men's words and faces, then i may make a guess at halflings! though,' and now he smiled, `there is something strange about you, frodo, an elvish air, maybe. but more lies upon our words together than i thought at first. i should now take you back to minas tirith to answer there to denetho

`i told no lies, and of the truth all i could,' said frodo.
`i do not blame you,' said faramir. 'you spoke with skill in a hard place, and wisely, it seemed to me. but i learned or guessed more from you than your words said. you were not friendly with boromir, or you did not part in friendship. you, and master samwise, too, i guess have some grievance. now i loved him dearly, and would gladly avenge his death, yet i knew him well. isildur's bane - i would hazard that isildur's bane lay between you and was a cause of contention in your company. clearly it is a mighty heirloom of some sort, and such things do not breed peace among confederates, not if aught may be learned from ancient tales. do i not hit near the mark?'

'ah, then it is as i thought: your trouble was with boromir alone. he wished this thing brought to minas tirith. alas! it is a crooked fate that seals your lips who saw him last, and holds from me that which i long to know: what was in his heart and thought in his latest hours. whether he erred or no, of this i am sure: he died well, achieving some good thing. his face was more beautiful even than in life.
`but, frodo, i pressed you hard at first about isildur's bane. forgive me! it was unwise in such an hour and place. i had not had time for thought. w

preserved of ancient lore among the rulers of the city that is not spread abroad. we of my house are not of the line of elendil. though the blood of númenor is in us. for we reckon back our line to mardil, the good steward, who ruled in the king's stead when he went away to war. and that was king eärnur, last of the line of anárion, and childless, and he came never back. and the stewards have governed the city since that day, though it was many generations of men ago.
'and this i remember of boromir as a boy, when we together learned the tale of our sires and the history of our city, that always it displeased him that his father was not king. "how many hundreds of years needs it to make a steward a king, if the king returns not? " he asked. "few years, maybe, in other places of less royalty," my father answered. "in gondor ten thousand years would not suffice." alas! poor boromir. does that not tell you something of him? '
'it does,' said frodo. `yet always he treated aragorn with honour.'

'alas! yes,' said frodo. `i saw him fall into the abyss.'
'i see that there is some great tale of dread in this.' said faramir `which perhaps you may tell me in the evening-time. this mithrandir was, i now guess, more than a lore-master: a great mover of the deeds that are done in our time. had he been among us to consult concerning the hard words of our dream, he could have made them clear to us without need of messenger. yet, maybe, he would not have done so, and the journey of boromir was doomed. mithrandir never spoke to us of what was to be, nor did he reveal his purposes. he got leave of denethor, how i do not know, to look at the secrets of our treasury, and i learned a little of him, when he would teach (and that was seldom). ever he would search and would question us above all else concerning the great battle that was fought upon dagorlad in the beginning of gondor, when he whom we do not name was overthrown. and he was eager for stories of isildur, though of him we ha

after ancient learning. nor when the riddling words of our dream were debated among us, did i think of isildur's bane as being this same thing. for isildur was ambushed and slain by orc-arrows, according to the only legend that we knew, and mithrandir had never told me more.
`what in truth this thing is i cannot yet guess; but some heirloom of power and peril it must be. a fell weapon, perchance, devised by the dark lord. if it were a thing that gave advantage in battle. i can well believe that boromir, the proud and fearless, often rash, ever anxious for the victory of minas tirith (and his own glory therein), might desire such a thing and be allured by it. alas that ever he went on that errand! i should have been chosen by my father and the elders but he put himself forward. as being the older and the hardier (both true), and he would not be stayed.

frodo made no answer. almost he yielded to the desire for help and counsel, to tell this grave young man, whose words seemed so wise and fair, all that was in his mind. but something held him back. his heart was heavy with fear and sorrow: if he and sam were indeed, as seemed likely, all that was now left of the nine walkers, then he was in sole command of the secret of their errand. better mistrust undeserved than rash words. and the memory of boromir, of the dreadful change that the lure of the ring had worked in him, was very present to his mind, when he looked at faramir and listened to his voice: unlike they were, and yet also much akin.
they walked on in silence for a while, passing like grey and green shadows under the old trees, their feet making no sound; above them many birds sang, and the sun glistened on the polished roof of dark leaves in the evergreen woods of ithilien.
sam had taken no part in the conversation, though he had li

`you may soon desire to sleep,' he said, 'and especially good samwise, who would not close his eyes before he ate - whether for fear of blunting the edge of a noble hunger, or for fear of me, i do not know. but it is not good to sleep too soon after meat, and that following a fast. let us talk a while. on your journey from rivendell there must have been many things to tell. and you, too, would perhaps wish to learn something of us and the lands where you now are. tell me of boromir my brother, and of old mithrandir, and of the fair people of lothlórien.'
frodo no longer felt sleepy and he was willing to talk. but though the food and wine had put him at his ease, he had not lost all his caution. sam was beaming and humming to himself, but when frodo spoke he was at first content to listen, only occasionally venturing to make an exclamation of agreement.
frodo told many tales, yet always he steered the matter away from the quest of the company and from the ring, enlarging

rather on the valiant part boromir had played in all their adventures. with the wolves of the wild, in the snows under caradhras, and in the mines of moria where gandalf fell. faramir was most moved by the story of the fight on the bridge.
`it must have irked boromir to run from orcs,' he said, `or even from the fell thing you name, the balrog - even though he was the last to leave.'
`he was the last,' said frodo, 'but aragorn was forced to lead us. he alone knew the way after gandalf's fall. but had there not been us lesser folk to care for, i do not think that either he or boromir would have fled.'
`maybe, it would have been better had boromir fallen there with mithrandir,' said faramir, `and not gone on to the fate that waited above the falls of rauros.'

o have become more like to them, and can scarce claim any longer the title high. we are become middle men, of the twilight, but with memory of other things. for as the rohirrim do, we now love war and valour as things good in themselves, both a sport and an end; and though we still hold that a warrior should have more skills and knowledge than only the craft of weapons and slaying, we esteem a warrior, nonetheless, above men of other crafts. such is the need of our days. so even was my brother, boromir: a man of prowess, and for that he was accounted the best man in gondor. and very valiant indeed he was: no heir of minas tirith has for long years been so hardy in toil, so onward into battle, or blown a mightier note on the great horn.' faramir sighed and fell silent for a while.

`i don't know about perilous,' said sam. `it strikes me that folk takes their peril with them into lórien, and finds it there because they've brought it. but perhaps you could call her perilous, because she's so strong in herself. you, you could dash yourself to pieces on her, like a ship on a rock; or drownd yourself, like a hobbit in a river. but neither rock nor river would be to blame. now boro - ' he stopped and went red in the face.
`yes? now boromir you would say? ' said faramir. `what would you say? he took his peril with him? '
`yes sir, begging your pardon, and a fine man as your brother was if i may say so. but you've been warm on the scent all along. now i watched boromir and listened to him, from rivendell all down the road - looking after my master, as you'll understand, and not meaning any harm to boromir - and it's my opinion that in lórien he first saw clearly what i guessed sooner: what he wanted. from the moment he first saw i

'so it seems,' said faramir, slowly and very softly, with a strange smile. `so that is the answer to all the riddles! the one ring that was thought to have perished from the world. and boromir tried to take it by force? and you escaped? and ran all the way - to me! and here in the wild i have you: two halflings, and a host of men at my call, and the ring of rings. a pretty stroke of fortune! a chance for faramir, captain of gondor, to show his quality! ha!' he stood up, very tall and stern, his grey eyes glinting.

 cave stopped talking and looked towards them in wonder. but faramir sat down again in his chair and began to laugh quietly, and then suddenly became grave again.
'alas for boromir! it was too sore a trial!
