_first mer._ sir, i commend you to your own content.    [_exit._

_ant. s._ he that commends me to mine own content
commends me to the thing i cannot get.
i to the world am like a drop of water,                             35
that in the ocean seeks another drop;
who, falling there to find his fellow forth,
unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:
so i, to find a mother and a brother,
in quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.                             40

here comes the almanac of my true date.
what now? how chance thou art returnâ€™d so soon?

_dro. e._ returnâ€™d so soon! rather approachâ€™d too late:
the capon burns, the pig falls from the spit;
the clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;                       45
my mistress made it one upon my cheek:
she is so hot, because the meat is cold;
the meat is cold, because you come not home;
you come not home, because you have no stomach;
you have no stomach, having broke your fas

but were we burdenâ€™d with like weight of pain,
as much, or more, we should ourselves complain:
so thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
with urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me;
but, if thou live to see like right bereft,                         40
this fool-beggâ€™d patience in thee will be left.

_luc._ well, i will marry one day, but to try.
here comes your man; now is your husband nigh.

_adr._ say, is your tardy master now at hand?

_dro. e._ nay, heâ€™s at two hands with me, and that my               45
two ears can witness.

_adr._ say, didst thou speak with him? knowâ€™st thou his mind?

_dro. e._ ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear:
beshrew his hand, i scarce could understand it.

_luc._ spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his            50
meaning?

feel his blows; and withal so doubtfu

  and balthazar._

_ant. e._ good signior angelo, you must excuse us all;
my wife is shrewish when i keep not hours:
say that i lingerâ€™d with you at your shop
to see the making of her carcanet,
and that to-morrow you will bring it home.                           5
but hereâ€™s a villain that would face me down
he met me on the mart, and that i beat him,
and charged him with a thousand marks in gold,
and that i did deny my wife and house.

or iâ€™ll attach you by this officer.

_ang._ even just the sum that i do owe to you
is growing to me by antipholus;
and in the instant that i met with you
he had of me a chain: at five oâ€™clock                               10
i shall receive the money for the same.
pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,
i will discharge my bond, and thank you too.

_ant. e._ while i go to the goldsmithâ€™s house, go thou              15
and buy a ropeâ€™s end: that will i bestow
among my wife and her confederates,
for locking me out of my doors by day.--
but, soft! i see the goldsmith. get thee gone;
buy thou a rope, and bring it home to me.                           20

my wife is in a wayward mood to-day,
