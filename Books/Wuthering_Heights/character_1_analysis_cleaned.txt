[CHARACTER]
the location of [CHARACTER]'s coffin symbolizes the conflict
that tears apart her short life. she is not buried in the chapel
with the lintons. nor is her coffin placed among the tombs of the
earnshaws. instead, as nelly describes in chapter xvi, [CHARACTER]
is buried "in a corner of the kirkyard, where the wall is so low
that heath and bilberry plants have climbed over it from the moor."
moreover, she is buried with edgar on one side and heathcliff on
the other, suggesting her conflicted loyalties. her actions are
driven in part by her social ambitions, which initially are awakened
during her first stay at the lintons', and which eventually compel
her to marry edgar. however, she is also motivated by impulses that
prompt her to violate social conventions--to love heathcliff, throw
temper tantrums, and run around on the moor.

isabella linton--[CHARACTER]'s sister-in-law and heathcliff's
wife, who was born in the same year that [CHARACTER] was--serves as [CHARACTER]'s
foil. the two women's parallel positions allow us to see their differences
with greater clarity. [CHARACTER] represents wild nature, in both
her high, lively spirits and her occasional cruelty, whereas isabella
represents culture and civilization, both in her refinement and
in her weakness.
