Helicanus - 
      
        One of Pericles's advisors in Tyre, Helicanus takes care of Pericles in his melancholy moods, and recommends he leave Tyre for a while after the events in Antioch. Helicanus takes over as provisionary ruler of Tyre; when Pericles fails to return, the citizens want to crown Helicanus king. But Helicanus is loyal to Pericles, so he refuses. Helicanus is a genuinely good man, not touched by ambition, who believes that Pericles is the only true ruler of Tyre.
