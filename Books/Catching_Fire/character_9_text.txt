rom district 1 who were victors in 
consecutive years when i was little. brutus, a 
volunteer from district 2, who must be at least forty 
and apparently can't wait to get back in the arena. 
finnick, the handsome bronze-haired guy from 
district 4 who was crowned ten years ago at the age 
of fourteen. a hysterical young woman with flowing 
brown hair is also called from 4, but she's quickly 
replaced by a volunteer, an eighty-year-old woman 
who needs a cane to walk to the stage. then there's 
johanna mason, the only living female victor from 7, 
who won a few years back by pretending she was a 
weakling. the woman from 8 who effie calls cecelia, 
who looks about thirty, has to detach herself from the 
three kids who run up to cling to her. chaff, a man 
from 1 1 who i know to be one of haymitch 's 
particular friends, is also in. 

i'm called. then haymitch. and peeta volunteers. one 
of the announcers actually gets teary because it 
seems the odds will never be in our favor, we star-

while he and haymitch guffaw. 

that's about all the time we get before the capitol 
attendants are firmly directing us toward the 
elevators. i get the distinct feeling they're not 
comfortable with the camaraderie among the victors, 
who couldn't seem to care less. as i walk toward the 
elevators, my hand still linked with peeta's, someone 
else rustles up to my side. the girl pulls off a 
headdress of leafy branches and tosses it behind her 
without bothering to look where it falls. 

johanna mason. from district 7 lumber and paper, 
thus the tree. she won by very convincingly 
portraying herself as weak and helpless so that she 
would be ignored. then she demonstrated a wicked 
ability to murder. she ruffles up her spiky hair and 
rolls her wide-set brown eyes. "isn't my costume 
awful? my stylist's the biggest idiot in the capitol. 
our tributes have been trees for forty years under 
her. wish i'd gotten cinna. you look fantastic." 

girl talk. that thing i've always been so bad at.

my suspicions of an uprising there. 

i glance around the training center. peeta is at the 
center of a ribald circle of knife throwers. the 
morphlings from district 6 are in the camouflage 
station, painting each other's faces with bright pink

swirls. the male tribute from district 5 is vomiting 
wine on the sword-fighting floor. finnick and the old 
woman from his district are using the archery station. 
johanna mason is naked again and oiling her skin 
down for a wrestling lesson. i decide to stay put. 

wiress and beetee make decent company. they seem 
friendly enough but don't pry. we talk about our 
talents; they tell me they both invent things, which 
makes my supposed interest in fashion seem pretty 
weak. wiress brings up some sort of stitching device 
she's working on. 

"it senses the density of the fabric and selects the 
strength," she says, and then becomes absorbed in a 
bit of dry straw before

"really?" he asks. "they're something of a joke to the 
others." 

"why does that not surprise me?" i say. i think of how 
peeta was always surrounded at school by a crowd of 
friends. it's amazing, really, that he ever took any 
notice of me except to think i was odd. 

"johanna's nicknamed them nuts and volts," he 
says. "i think she's nuts and he's volts." 

"and so i'm stupid for thinking they might be useful. 
because of something johanna mason said while she 
was oiling up her breasts for wrestling," i retort. 

"actually i think the nickname's been around for 
years. and i didn't mean that as an insult. i'm just 
sharing information," he says. 

"well, wiress and beetee are smart. they invent 
things. they could tell by sight that a force field had 
been put up between us and the gamemakers. and if 
we have to have allies, i want them." i toss the ladle 
back in a pot of stew, splattering us both with the 
gravy.

brother's hand and pulls him into place to lead our 
procession onto the stage. the other tributes begin to 
line up as well. i'm confused because, while they all 
are angry, some are giving us sympathetic pats on the 
shoulder, and johanna mason actually stops to 
straighten my pearl necklace. 

"make him pay for it, okay?" she says. 

i nod, but i don't know what she means. not until 
we're all sitting out onstage and caesar flickerman, 
hair and face highlighted in lavender this year, has 
done his opening spiel and the tributes begin their 
interviews. this is the first time i realize the depth of 
betrayal felt among the victors and the rage that 
accompanies it. but they are so smart, so wonderfully 
smart about how they play it,

ith a speech about 
how she just can't stop crying when she thinks of how 
much the people in the capitol must be suffering 
because they will lose us. gloss recalls the kindness 
shown here to him and his sister. beetee questions 
the legality of the quell in his nervous, twitchy way, 
wondering if it's been fully examined by experts of 
late. finnick recites a poem he wrote to his one true 
love in the capitol, and about a hundred people faint 
because they're sure he means them. by the time 
johanna mason gets up, she's asking if something 
can't be done about the situation. surely the creators 
of the quarter quell never anticipated such love 
forming between the victors and the capitol. no one

could be so cruel as to sever such a deep bond. 
seeder quietly ruminates about how, back in district

so if he's all-powerful, why doesn't he change the 
quell? and chaff, who comes right on her heel

that the one who was being dragged 
collapses on the beach. the dragger stamps the 
ground in frustration and, in an apparent fit of 
temper, turns and shoves the circling, deranged one 
over. 

finnick's face lights up. "johanna!" he calls, and runs 
for the red things. 

"finnick!" i hear johanna's voice reply. 

i exchange a look with peeta. "what now?" i ask. 

"we can't really leave finnick," he says. 

"guess not. come on, then," i say grouchily, because 
even if i'd had a list of allies, johanna mason would 
definitely not have been on it. the two of us tromp 
down the beach to where finnick and johanna are 
just meeting up. as we move in closer, i see her 
companions, and confusion sets in. that's beetee on 
the ground on his back and wiress who's regained 
her feet to continue making loops. "she's got wiress 
and beetee." 

"nuts and volts?" says peeta, equally puzzled. "i've 
got to hear how this happened." 

when we reach them, johanna's gesturing toward the 
jungle and talking very fast

ging over his head. so easy to make 
it look like an accident down there. a silent canary, a 
spark, and nothing more. 

i go back to imagining killing the president. 

despite her annoyance at wiress, johanna's as happy 
as i've seen her in the arena. while i'm adding to my 
stock of arrows, she pokes around until she comes up 
with a pair of lethal-looking axes. it seems an odd 
choice until i see her throw one with such force it 
sticks in the sun-softened gold of the cornucopia. of 
course. johanna mason. district 7. lumber. i bet 
she's been tossing around axes since she could 
toddle. it's like finnick with his trident. or beetee 
with his wire. rue with her knowledge of plants. i 
realize it's just another disadvantage the district 12 
tributes have faced over the years. we don't go down 
in the mines until we're eighteen. it looks like most of 
the other tributes learn something about their trades 
early on. there are things you do in a mine that could 
come in handy in the games. wielding

i remember thinking that was the gift the leader of 
our revolution should have. has haymitch convinced 
the others of this? that peeta's tongue would have far 
greater power against the capitol than any physical 
strength the rest of us could claim? i don't know. it 
still seems like a really long leap for some of the 
tributes. i mean, we're talking about johanna mason 
here. but what other explanation can there be for 
their decided efforts to keep him alive? 

"katniss, got that spile?" finnick asks, snapping me 
back to reality. i cut the vine that ties the spile to my 
belt and hold the metal tube out to him. 

that's when i hear the scream. so full of fear and 
pain it ices my blood. and so familiar. i drop the spile, 
forget where i am or what lies ahead, only know i 
must reach her, protect her. i run wildly in the 
direction of the voice, heedless of

me punished. his hand reaches for me, i think to 
strike me, but he does something worse. with his 
thumb and his forefinger, he slides my eyelids shut, 
sentencing me to the vulnerability of darkness. they 
can do anything to me now and i will not even see it 
coming. 

my heart pounds so hard the blood begins to stream 
from beneath my soaked moss bandage. my thoughts 
grow foggy. possibly i can bleed to death before they 
can revive me after all. in my mind, i whisper a 
thank-you to johanna mason for the excellent wound 
she inflicted as i black out. 

when i swim back into semi consciousness, i can feel 
i'm lying on a padded table. there's the pinching 
sensation of tubes in my left arm. they are trying to 
keep me alive because, if i slide quietly, privately into 
death, it will be a victory. i'm still largely unable to 
move, open my eyelids, raise my head. but my right 
arm has regained a little motion. it flops across my 
body, feeling like a flipper, no, something less
