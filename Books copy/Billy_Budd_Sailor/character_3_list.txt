The Dansker - 
                 Billy's
acquaintance and confidante aboard the Bellipotent. A
wizened old sailor with beady eyes, the Dansker listens and occasionally
issues inscrutable, oracular responses when Billy seeks out his
confidence. At other times, however, the Dansker is decidedly reticent
and unhelpful.
