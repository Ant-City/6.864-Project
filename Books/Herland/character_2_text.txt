then terry laid his hand upon his chest--a fine chest he had, too,
and introduced himself; he was braced carefully for the occasion and
achieved an excellent obeisance.

again they laughed delightedly, and the one nearest me followed his
tactics.

â€œcelis,â€ she said distinctly, pointing to the one in blue; â€œalimaâ€--the
one in rose; then, with a vivid imitation of terryâ€™s impressive manner,
she laid a firm delicate hand on her gold-green jerkin--â€œellador.â€ this
was pleasant, but we got no nearer.

â€œwe canâ€™t sit here and learn the language,â€ terry protested. he beckoned
to them to come nearer, most winningly--but they gaily shook their
heads. he suggested, by signs, that we all go down together; but again
they shook their heads, still merrily. then ellador clearly indicated
that we should go down, pointing to each and all of us, with
unmistakable firmness; and further seeming to imply by the sweep of a
lithe arm that we not only go downw

quietly but swiftly we rushed forward and began to tug at the fastenings
of that cover.

â€œconfound the thing!â€ terry cried in desperate impatience. â€œtheyâ€™ve got
it sewed up in a bag! and weâ€™ve not a knife among us!â€

then, as we tugged and pulled at that tough cloth we heard a sound that
made terry lift his head like a war horse--the sound of an unmistakable
giggle, yes--three giggles.

there they were--celis, alima, ellador--looking just as they had when
we first saw them, standing a little way off from us, as interested, as
mischievous as three schoolboys.

â€œhold on, terry--hold on!â€ i warned. â€œthatâ€™s too easy. look out for a
trap.â€

â€œlet us appeal to their kind hearts,â€ jeff urged. â€œi think they will
help us. perhaps theyâ€™ve got knives.â€

â€œitâ€™s no use rushing them, anyhow,â€ i was absolutely holding on to
terry. â€œwe know they can out-run and out-climb us.â€

 been hungry; we had found plenty to eat and
had not been sparing in helping ourselves. but they seemed somewhat
impressed; and after a murmured consultation they produced from their
pockets certain little packages, and with the utmost ease and accuracy
tossed them into our hands.

jeff was most appreciative of this; and terry made extravagant gestures
of admiration, which seemed to set them off, boy-fashion, to show their
skill. while we ate the excellent biscuits they had thrown us, and while
ellador kept a watchful eye on our movements, celis ran off to some
distance, and set up a sort of â€œduck-on-a-rockâ€ arrangement, a big
yellow nut on top of three balanced sticks; alima, meanwhile, gathering
stones.

they urged us to throw at it, and we did, but the thing was a long way
off, and it was only after a number of failures, at which those elvish
damsels laughed delightedly, that jeff succeeded in bringing the whole
structure to the ground. it took me still longer, and terry, to his

over; he would rush off to console himself with some other fair one--the
other fair one would have none of him--and he would drift back to alima,
becoming more and more devoted each time.

she never gave an inch. a big, handsome creature, rather exceptionally
strong even in that race of strong women, with a proud head and sweeping
level brows that lined across above her dark eager eyes like the wide
wings of a soaring hawk.

i was good friends with all three of them but best of all with ellador,
long before that feeling changed, for both of us.

from her, and from somel, who talked very freely with me, i learned at
last something of the viewpoint of herland toward its visitors.

here they were, isolated, happy, contented, when the booming buzz of our
biplane tore the air above them.

everybody heard it--saw it--for miles and miles, word flashed all over
the country, and a council was held in every town and village.

and this was their rapid determination:

discussed not ownership, but which museum to put them in.

when a man has nothing to give a woman, is dependent wholly on his
personal attraction, his courtship is under limitations.

they were considering these two things: the advisability of making the
great change; and the degree of personal adaptability which would best
serve that end.

here we had the advantage of our small personal experience with those
three fleet forest girls; and that served to draw us together.

as for ellador: suppose you come to a strange land and find it pleasant
enough--just a little more than ordinarily pleasant--and then you find
rich farmland, and then gardens, gorgeous gardens, and then palaces
full of rare and curious treasures--incalculable, inexhaustible, and
then--mountains--like the himalayas, and then the sea.

jeffâ€™s ultra-devotion rather puzzled celis, really put off their day
of happiness, while terry and alima quarreled and parted, re-met and
re-parted, ellador and i grew to be close friends.

we talked and talked. we took long walks together. she showed me things,
explained them, interpreted much that i had not understood. through her
sympathetic intelligence i became more and more comprehending of the
spirit of the people of herland, more and more appreciative of its
marvelous inner growth as well as outer perfection.

i ceased to feel a stranger, a prisoner. there was a sense of
understanding, of identity, of purpose. we discussed--everything. and,

she turned to me, with that high, sweet look of hers, and then, as her
eyes rested in mine and her hands too--then suddenly there blazed out
between us a farther glory, instant, overwhelming--quite beyond any
words of mine to tell.

celis was a blue-and-gold-and-rose person; alma,
black-and-white-and-red, a blazing beauty. ellador was brown: hair dark
and soft, like a seal coat; clear brown skin with a healthy red in
it; brown eyes--all the way from topaz to black velvet they seemed to
range--splendid girls, all of them.

they had seen us first of all, far down in the lake below, and flashed
the tidings across the land even before our first exploring flight. they
had watched our landing, flitted through the forest with us, hidden in
that tree and--i shrewdly suspect--giggled on purpose.

they had kept watch over our hood

es shining.

â€œdoes it work?â€ asked alima, in her keen, swift way. â€œdo all men in all
countries carry everything? or is it only in yours?â€

â€œdonâ€™t be so literal,â€ terry begged lazily. â€œwhy arenâ€™t you willing to
be worshipped and waited on? we like to do it.â€

â€œyou donâ€™t like to have us do it to you,â€ she answered.

â€œthatâ€™s different,â€ he said, annoyed; and when she said, â€œwhy is it?â€ he
quite sulked, referring her to me, saying, â€œvanâ€™s the philosopher.â€

ellador and i talked it all out together, so that we had an easier
experience of it when the real miracle time came. also, between us, we
made things clearer to jeff and celis. but terry would not listen to
reason.

he was madly in love with alima. he wanted to take her by storm, and
nearly lost her forever.

you see, if a man loves a girl who is in the first place young and
inexperienced; who in the second place is educated with a background
of caveman tradition, a middle-ground of poetry and romance,

cess. he tried it here, and alima was so affronted, so repelled, that
it was weeks before he got near enough to try again.

the more coldly she denied him, the hotter his determination; he was
not used to real refusal. the approach of flattery she dismissed with
laughter, gifts and such â€œattentionsâ€ we could not bring to bear, pathos
and complaint of cruelty stirred only a reasoning inquiry. it took terry
a long time.

i doubt if she ever accepted her strange lover as fully as did celis
and ellador theirs. he had hurt and offended her too often; there were
reservations.

but i think alima retained some faint vestige of long-descended feeling
which made terry more possible to her than to others; and that she had
made up her mind to the experiment and hated to renounce it.

however it came about, we all three at length achieved full
understanding, and solemnly faced what was to them a step of measureless
importance, a grave question as well as a great happiness; to us a
strange, new joy.

€ of our own,
they could not understand it.

â€œour work takes us all around the country,â€ explained celis. â€œwe cannot
live in one place all the time.â€

â€œwe are together now,â€ urged alima, looking proudly at terryâ€™s stalwart
nearness. (this was one of the times when they were â€œon,â€ though
presently â€œoffâ€ again.)

â€œitâ€™s not the same thing at all,â€ he insisted. â€œa man wants a home of
his own, with his wife and family in it.â€

â€œstaying in it? all the time?â€ asked ellador. â€œnot imprisoned, surely!â€

â€œof course not! living there--naturally,â€ he answered.

â€œwhat does she do there--all the time?â€ alima demanded. â€œwhat is her
work?â€

then terry patiently explained again that our women did not work--with
reservations.

â€œbut what do they do--if they have no work?â€ she persisted.

â€œthey take care of the home--and the children.â€

â€œat the same time?â€ asked ellador.

â€œwhy yes. the children play about, and the mother has charge of it all.

we explained as best we might. we talked of â€œsocial duties,â€
 disingenuously banking on their not interpreting the words as we did; we
talked of hospitality, entertainment, and various â€œinterests.â€ all the
time we knew that to these large-minded women whose whole mental outlook
was so collective, the limitations of a wholly personal life were
inconceivable.

â€œwe cannot really understand it,â€ ellador concluded. â€œwe are only half
a people. we have our woman-ways and they have their man-ways and their
both-ways. we have worked out a system of living which is, of course,
limited. they must have a broader, richer, better one. i should like to
see it.â€

â€œyou shall, dearest,â€ i whispered.

fierce though temporary despair, he had plunged to the cliff edge with
some vague view to escape, he found several of them close by. we were
free--but there was a string to it.

â€œtheyâ€™ve no unpleasant ones, either,â€ jeff reminded him.

â€œwish they had!â€ terry persisted. â€œtheyâ€™ve neither the vices of men, nor
the virtues of women--theyâ€™re neuters!â€

â€œyou know better than that. donâ€™t talk nonsense,â€ said i, severely.

i was thinking of elladorâ€™s eyes when they gave me a certain look, a
look she did not at all realize.

jeff was equally incensed. â€œi donâ€™t know what â€˜virtues of womenâ€™ you
miss. seems to me they have all of them.â€

â€œtheyâ€™ve no modesty,â€ snapped terry. â€œno patience, no submissiveness,
none of that natural yielding which is womanâ€™s greatest charm.â€

terry. youâ€™ve got a grouch, thatâ€™s all. these women have the virtue

; and then the children, taking part as naturally as ours would
frolic round a christmas tree--it was overpowering in the impression of
joyous, triumphant life.

they had begun at a period when the drama, the dance, music, religion,
and education were all very close together; and instead of developing
them in detached lines, they had kept the connection. let me try again
to give, if i can, a faint sense of the difference in the life view--the
background and basis on which their culture rested.

ellador told me a lot about it. she took me to see the children, the
growing girls, the special teachers. she picked out books for me to
read. she always seemed to understand just what i wanted to know, and
how to give it to me.

while terry and alima struck sparks and parted--he always madly drawn
to her and she to him--she must have been, or sheâ€™d never have stood the
way he behaved--ellador and i had already a deep, restful feeling, as
if weâ€™d always had one another. jeff and celis were happy; t

here was no
question of that; but it didnâ€™t seem to me as if they had the good times
we did.

well, here is the herland child facing life--as ellador tried to show
it to me. from the first memory, they knew peace, beauty, order, safety,
love, wisdom, justice, patience, and plenty. by â€œplentyâ€ i mean that the
babies grew up in an environment which met their needs, just as young
fawns might grow up in dewy forest glades and brook-fed meadows. and
they enjoyed it as frankly and utterly as the fawns would.

they found themselves in a big bright lovely world, full of the most
interesting and enchanting things to learn about and to do. the peo

dly and polite. no herland child ever met the
overbearing rudeness we so commonly show to children. they were people,
too, from the first; the most precious part of the nation.

in each step of the rich experience of living, they found the instance
they were studying widen out into contact with an endless range of
common interests. the things they learned were related, from the first;
related to one another, and to the national prosperity.

â€œit was a butterfly that made me a forester,â€ said ellador. â€œi was about
eleven years old, and i found a big purple-and-green butterfly on a low
flower. i caught it, very carefully, by the closed wings, as i had been
told to do, and carried it to the nearest insect teacherâ€--i made a note
there to ask her what on earth an insect teacher was--â€œto ask her its
name. she took it from me with a little cry of delight. â€˜oh, you blessed
child,â€™ she said. â€˜do you like obernuts?â€™ of course i liked obernuts,
and said so. it is our best food-nut, you

hat they have never been re-established. the steady level of
good health gave them all that natural stimulus we used to call â€œanimal
spiritsâ€--an odd contradiction in terms. they found themselves in an
immediate environment which was agreeable and interesting, and before
them stretched the years of learning and discovery, the fascinating,
endless process of education.

as i looked into these methods and compared them with our own, my
strange uncomfortable sense of race-humility grew apace.

ellador could not understand my astonishment. she explained things
kindly and sweetly, but with some amazement that they needed explaining,
and with sudden questions as to how we did it that left me meeker than
ever.

i betook myself to somel one day, carefully not taking ellador. i did
not mind seeming foolish to somel--she was used to it.

â€œi want a chapter of explanation,â€ i told her. â€œyou know my stupidities
by heart, and i do not want to show them to ellador--she thinks me so
wise!â€

the herland child was born not only into a world carefully prepared,
full of the most fascinating materials and opportunities to learn, but
into the society of plentiful numbers of teachers, teachers born and
trained, whose business it was to accompany the children along that, to
us, impossible thing--the royal road to learning.

there was no mystery in their methods. being adapted to children it was
at least comprehensible to adults. i spent many days with the little
ones, sometimes with ellador, sometimes without, and began to feel a
crushing pity for my own childhood, and for all others that i had known.

the houses and gardens planned for babies had in them nothing to
hurt--no stairs, no corners, no small loose objects to swallow, no
fire--just a babiesâ€™ paradise. they were taught, as rapidly as
feasible, to use and control their own bodies, and never did i see such
sure-footed, steady-handed, clear-headed little things. it was a joy

chapter 10. their religions and our marriages


it took me a long time, as a man, a foreigner, and a species
of christian--i was that as much as anything--to get any clear
understanding of the religion of herland.

its deification of motherhood was obvious enough; but there was far more
to it than that; or, at least, than my first interpretation of that.

i think it was only as i grew to love ellador more than i believed
anyone could love anybody, as i grew faintly to appreciate her inner
attitude and state of mind, that i began to get some glimpses of this
faith of theirs.

when i asked her about it, she tried at first to tell me, and then,
seeing me flounder, asked for more information about ours. she soon
found that we had many, that they varied widely, but had some points
in common. a clear methodical luminous mind had my ellador, not only
reasonable, but swiftly perceptive.

she made a

 was love--and wisdom--and power?â€

â€œyes--all of that.â€

her eyes grew large, her face ghastly pale.

â€œand yet that such a god could put little new babies to burn--for
eternity?â€ she fell into a sudden shuddering and left me, running
swiftly to the nearest temple.

every smallest village had its temple, and in those gracious retreats
sat wise and noble women, quietly busy at some work of their own until
they were wanted, always ready to give comfort, light, or help, to any
applicant.

ellador told me afterward how easily this grief of hers was assuaged,
and seemed ashamed of not having helped herself out of it.

â€œyou see, we are not accustomed to horrible ideas,â€ she said, coming
back to me rather apologetically. â€œwe havenâ€™t any. and when we get a
thing like that into our minds itâ€™s like--oh, like red pepper in your
eyes. so i just ran to her, blinded and almost screaming, and she took
it out so quickly--so easily!â€

â€œhow?â€ i asked, very curious.

â€œâ€˜why, you bles

sed child,â€™ she said, â€˜youâ€™ve got the wrong idea
altogether. you do not have to think that there ever was such a god--for
there wasnâ€™t. or such a happening--for there wasnâ€™t. nor even that this
hideous false idea was believed by anybody. but only this--that people
who are utterly ignorant will believe anything--which you certainly knew
before.â€™â€

â€œanyhow,â€ pursued ellador, â€œshe turned pale for a minute when i first
said it.â€

this was a lesson to me. no wonder this whole nation of women was
peaceful and sweet in expression--they had no horrible ideas.

â€œsurely you had some when you began,â€ i suggested.

â€œoh, yes, no doubt. but as soon as our religion grew to any height at
all we left them out, of course.â€

from this, as from many other things, i grew to see what i finally put
in words.

â€œhave you no respect for the past? for what was thought and be

eved by
your foremothers?â€

â€œwhy, no,â€ she said. â€œwhy should we? they are all gone. they knew less
than we do. if we are not beyond them, we are unworthy of them--and
unworthy of the children who must go beyond us.â€

this set me thinking in good earnest. i had always imagined--simply from
hearing it said, i suppose--that women were by nature conservative. yet
these women, quite unassisted by any masculine spirit of enterprise, had
ignored their past and built daringly for the future.

ellador watched me think. she seemed to know pretty much what was going
on in my mind.

â€œitâ€™s because we began in a new way, i suppose. all our folks were swept
away at once, and then, after that time of despair, came those wonder
children--the first. and then the whole breathless hope of us was for
their children--if they should have them. and they did! then there was
the period of pride and triumph till we grew too numerous; and after
that, when it all came down to one child apiece, we began to r

â€œoh, no,â€ she insisted, smiling, shaking her soft brown hair. â€œwe do
things from our mothers--not for them. we donâ€™t have to do things
for them--they donâ€™t need it, you know. but we have to live
on--splendidly--because of them; and thatâ€™s the way we feel about god.â€

i meditated again. i thought of that god of battles of ours,
that jealous god, that vengeance-is-mine god. i thought of our
world-nightmare--hell.

â€œyou have no theory of eternal punishment then, i take it?â€

ellador laughed. her eyes were as bright as stars, and there were tears
in them, too. she was so sorry for me.

â€œhow could we?â€ she asked, fairly enough. â€œwe have no punishments in
life, you see, so we donâ€™t imagine them after death.â€

â€œhave you no punishments? neither for children nor criminals--such mild
criminals as you have?â€ i urged.

â€œdo you punish a person for a broken leg or a fever? we have preventive
measures, and cures; sometimes we have to â€˜send the patient to bed,â€™ as

â€œit is beautiful!â€ i cried enthusiastically. â€œit is the most practical,
comforting, progressive religion i ever heard of. you do love one
another--you do bear one anotherâ€™s burdens--you do realize that a little
child is a type of the kingdom of heaven. you are more christian than
any people i ever saw. but--how about death? and the life everlasting?
what does your religion teach about eternity?â€

â€œnothing,â€ said ellador. â€œwhat is eternity?â€

what indeed? i tried, for the first time in my life, to get a real hold
on the idea.

â€œit is--never stopping.â€

â€œnever stopping?â€ she looked puzzled.

â€œyes, life, going on forever.â€

â€œoh--we see that, of course. life does go on forever, all about us.â€

â€œbut eternal life goes on without dying.â€

â€œthe same person?â€

â€œyes, the same person, unending, immortal.â€ i was pleased to think
that i had something to teach from our religion, which theirs

mind heaping up the people, and hurriedly reassured her.

â€œoh no, indeed, not here--hereafter. we must die here, of course, but
then we â€˜enter into eternal life.â€™ the soul lives forever.â€

â€œhow do you know?â€ she inquired.

â€œi wonâ€™t attempt to prove it to you,â€ i hastily continued. â€œlet us

 and certain well-grounded suspicions of international marriages, which
seem to persist in the interests of social progress, rather than in
those of the contracting parties.

but no combination of alien races, of color, of caste, or creed, was
ever so basically difficult to establish as that between us, three
modern american men, and these three women of herland.

it is all very well to say that we should have been frank about it
beforehand. we had been frank. we had discussed--at least ellador and
i had--the conditions of the great adventure, and thought the path
was clear before us. but there are some things one takes for granted,
supposes are mutually understood, and to which both parties may
repeatedly refer without ever meaning the same thing.

the differences in the education of the average man and woman are
great enough, but the trouble they make is not mostly for the man; he
generally carries out his own views of the case. the woman may have

recognized that we should breathe easier if able to free our minds in
real seclusion.

for food we either went to any convenient eating-house, ordered a meal
brought in, or took it with us to the woods, always and equally good.
all this we had become used to and enjoyed--in our courting days.

after marriage there arose in us a somewhat unexpected urge of feeling
that called for a separate house; but this feeling found no response in
the hearts of those fair ladies.

â€œwe are alone, dear,â€ ellador explained to me with gentle patience.
â€œwe are alone in these great forests; we may go and eat in any little
summer-house--just we two, or have a separate table anywhere--or even
have a separate meal in our own rooms. how could we be aloner?â€

this was all very true. we had our pleasant mutual solitude about our
work, and our pleasant evening talks in their apartments or ours; we
had, as it were, all the pleasures of courtship carried right on; but we
had no sense of--perhaps it may be calle

â€œmight as well not be married at all,â€ growled terry. â€œthey only got up
that ceremony to please us--please jeff, mostly. theyâ€™ve no real idea of
being married.â€

i tried my best to get elladorâ€™s point of view, and naturally i tried to
give her mine. of course, what we, as men, wanted to make them see was
that there were other, and as we proudly said â€œhigher,â€ uses in this
relation than what terry called â€œmere parentage.â€ in the highest terms i
knew i tried to explain this to ellador.

â€œanything higher than for mutual love to hope to give life, as we did?â€
 she said. â€œhow is it higher?â€

â€œit develops love,â€ i explained. â€œall the power of beautiful permanent

married lovers, and the result in higher stimulus to all creative work.

â€œdo you mean,â€ she asked quite calmly, as if i was not holding her cool
firm hands in my hot and rather quivering ones, â€œthat with you, when
people marry, they go right on doing this in season and out of season,
with no thought of children at all?â€

â€œthey do,â€ i said, with some bitterness. â€œthey are not mere parents.
they are men and women, and they love each other.â€

â€œhow long?â€ asked ellador, rather unexpectedly.

â€œhow long?â€ i repeated, a little dashed. â€œwhy as long as they live.â€

â€œthere is something very beautiful in the idea,â€ she admitted, still as
if she were discussing life on mars. â€œthis climactic expression, which,
in all the other life-forms, has but the one purpose, has with you
become specialized to higher, purer, nobler uses. it has--i judge from
what you tell me--the most ennobling effect on character. people marry,

had changed, that my feelings changed also. and more than all, i found
this--a factor of enormous weight--these women were not provocative.
that made an immense difference.

the thing that terry had so complained of when we first came--that they
werenâ€™t â€œfeminine,â€ they lacked â€œcharm,â€ now became a great comfort.
their vigorous beauty was an aesthetic pleasure, not an irritant. their
dress and ornaments had not a touch of the â€œcome-and-find-meâ€ element.

even with my own ellador, my wife, who had for a time unveiled a womanâ€™s
heart and faced the strange new hope and joy of dual parentage, she
afterward withdrew again into the same good comrade she had been at
first. they were women, plus, and so much plus that when they did not
choose to let the womanness appear, you could not find it anywhere.

i donâ€™t say it was easy for me; it wasnâ€™t. but when i made appeal to
her sympathies i came up against another immovable wall. she was sorry,
honestly sorry, for my distre

only men in it; we get tired
of our ultra-maleness and turn gladly to the ultra-femaleness. also,
in keeping our women as feminine as possible, we see to it that when
we turn to them we find the thing we want always in evidence. well, the
atmosphere of this place was anything but seductive. the very numbers
of these human women, always in human relation, made them anything
but alluring. when, in spite of this, my hereditary instincts and
race-traditions made me long for the feminine response in ellador,
instead of withdrawing so that i should want her more, she deliberately
gave me a little too much of her society.--always de-feminized, as it
were. it was awfully funny, really.

here was i, with an ideal in mind, for which i hotly longed, and here

what i wanted. i see now clearly enough why a certain kind of man, like

gets in the way of the sex ideal; it temporarily covers and excludes
femininity.

of course, in this case, i was so fond of ellador my friend, of ellador
my professional companion, that i necessarily enjoyed her society on any
terms. only--when i had had her with me in her de-feminine capacity for
a sixteen-hour day, i could go to my own room and sleep without dreaming
about her.

the witch! if ever anybody worked to woo and win and hold a human soul,
she did, great superwoman that she was. i couldnâ€™t then half comprehend
the skill of it, the wonder. but this i soon began to find: that under
all our cultivated attitude of mind toward women, th

deeper, more â€œnaturalâ€ feeling, the restful reverence which looks up to
the mother sex.

so we grew together in friendship and happiness, ellador and i, and so
did jeff and celis.

when it comes to terryâ€™s part of it, and alimaâ€™s, iâ€™m sorry--and
iâ€™m ashamed. of course i blame her somewhat. she wasnâ€™t as fine
a psychologist as ellador, and whatâ€™s more, i think she had a
far-descended atavistic trace of more marked femaleness, never apparent
till terry called it out. but when all is said, it doesnâ€™t excuse him. i
hadnâ€™t realized to the full terryâ€™s character--i couldnâ€™t, being a man.

the position was the same as with us, of course, only with these
distinctions. alima, a shade more alluring, and several shades less able
as a practical psychologist; terry, a hundredfold more demanding--and
proportionately less reason

a â€˜eap with the white.

jeff turned sharply and left him at the time. i was a bit disquieted
myself.

poor old terry! the things heâ€™d learned didnâ€™t help him a heap in
herland. his idea was to take--he thought that was the way. he thought,
he honestly believed, that women like it. not the women of herland! not
alima!

i can see her now--one day in the very first week of their marriage,
setting forth to her dayâ€™s work with long determined strides and
hard-set mouth, and sticking close to ellador. she didnâ€™t wish to be
alone with terry--you could see that.

but the more she kept away from him, the more he wanted her--naturally.

he made a tremendous row about their separate establishments, tried to
keep her in his rooms, tried to stay in hers. but there she drew the
line sharply.

he came away one night, and stamped up and down the moonlit road,
swearing under his breath. i was taking a walk that night too, but i
wasnâ€™t in his state of mind. to hear him rage youâ€™d not have believe

e women of herland have no fear of men. why should they have? they
are not timid in any sense. they are not weak; and they all have strong
trained athletic bodies. othello could not have extinguished alima with
a pillow, as if she were a mouse.

terry put in practice his pet conviction that a woman loves to be
mastered, and by sheer brute force, in all the pride and passion of his
intense masculinity, he tried to master this woman.

it did not work. i got a pretty clear account of it later from ellador,
but what we heard at the time was the noise of a tremendous struggle,
and alima calling to moadine. moadine was close by and came at once; one
or two more strong grave women followed.

terry dashed about like a madman; he would cheerfully have killed
them--he told me that, himself--but he couldnâ€™t. when he swung a chair
over his head one sprang in the air and caught it, two threw themselves
bodily upon him and forced him to the floor; it was only the work of a
few moments to have him tied ha

hill horror. â€œparcel of old maids!â€ he called them.
â€œtheyâ€™re all old maids--children or not. they donâ€™t know the first thing
about sex.â€

when terry said sex, sex with a very large _s_, he meant the male sex,
naturally; its special values, its profound conviction of being â€œthe
life force,â€ its cheerful ignoring of the true life process, and its
interpretation of the other sex solely from its own point of view.

i had learned to see these things very differently since living with
ellador; and as for jeff, he was so thoroughly herlandized that he
wasnâ€™t fair to terry, who fretted sharply in his new restraint.

moadine, grave and strong, as sadly patient as a mother with a
degenerate child, kept steady watch on him, with enough other women
close at hand to prevent an outbreak. he had no weapons, and well knew
that all his strength was of small avail against those grim, quiet
women.

we were allowed to visit him freely, but he had only his room, and a
small high-walled garden to

departure were under way.

three of us were to go: terry, because he must; i, because two were
safer for our flyer, and the long boat trip to the coast; ellador,
because she would not let me go without her.

if jeff had elected to return, celis would have gone too--they were the
most absorbed of lovers; but jeff had no desire that way.

â€œwhy should i want to go back to all our noise and dirt, our vice and
crime, our disease and degeneracy?â€ he demanded of me privately. we
never spoke like that before the women. â€œi wouldnâ€™t take celis there for
anything on earth!â€ he protested. â€œsheâ€™d die! sheâ€™d die of horror and
shame to see our slums a

nd hospitals. how can you risk it with ellador?
youâ€™d better break it to her gently before she really makes up her
mind.â€

jeff was right. i ought to have told her more fully than i did, of all
the things we had to be ashamed of. but it is very hard to bridge the
gulf of as deep a difference as existed between our life and theirs. i
tried to.

â€œlook here, my dear,â€ i said to her. â€œif you are really going to my
country with me, youâ€™ve got to be prepared for a good many shocks. itâ€™s
not as beautiful as this--the cities, i mean,

 you are yourself,â€ she insisted, â€œand
you must be desperately homesick.â€

i assured her that no one could be homesick in such a paradise as
theirs, but she would have none of it.

â€œoh, yes--i know. itâ€™s like those little tropical islands youâ€™ve told me
about, shining like jewels in the big blue sea--i canâ€™t wait to see the
sea! the little island may be as perfect as a garden, but you always
want to get back to your own big country, donâ€™t you? even if it is bad
in some ways?â€

ellador was more than willing. but the nearer it came to our really
going, and to my having to take her back to our â€œcivilization,â€ after
the clean peace and beauty of theirs, the more i began to dread it, and
the more i tried to explain.

of course i had been homesick at first, while we were prisoners, before
i had ellador. and of course i had, at first, rather idealized my
country and its ways, in describing it. also, i had always accepted
certain evils as integral parts of our civilization and n

, upreaching lines, reaching higher
and going faster up to the smooth comfort of their present life. we
had learned a little of their psychology, a much wider field than the
history, but here we could not follow so readily. we were now well used
to seeing women not as females but as people; people of all sorts, doing
every kind of work.

this outbreak of terryâ€™s, and the strong reaction against it, gave us
a new light on their genuine femininity. this was given me with great
clearness by both ellador and somel. the feeling was the same--sick
revulsion and horror, such as would be felt at some climactic blasphemy.

they had no faintest approach to such a thing in their minds, knowing
nothing of the custom of marital indulgence among us. to them the one
high purpose of motherhood had been for so long the governing law of
life, and the contribution of the father, though known to them, so
distinctly another method to the same end, that they could not, with all
their effort, get the point of vie

w of the male creature whose desires
quite ignore parentage and seek only for what we euphoniously term â€œthe
joys of love.â€

when i tried to tell ellador that women too felt so, with us, she drew
away from me, and tried hard to grasp intellectually what she could in
no way sympathize with.

â€œyou mean--that with you--love between man and woman expresses itself in
that way--without regard to motherhood? to parentage, i mean,â€ she added
carefully.

â€œyes, surely. it is love we think of--the deep sweet love between two.
of course we want children, and children come--but that is not what we
think about.â€

â€œbut--but--it seems so against natur

ily. but there rose in her eyes that look i knew so
well, that remote clear look as if she had gone far away even though
i held her beautiful body so close, and was now on some snowy mountain
regarding me from a distance.

â€œi feel it quite clearly,â€ she said to me. â€œit gives me a deep sympathy
with what you feel, no doubt more strongly still. but what i feel, even
what you feel, dearest, does not convince me that it is right. until i
am sure of that, of course i cannot do as you wish.â€

ellador, at times like this, always reminded me of epictetus. â€œi will
put you in prison!â€ said his master. â€œmy body, you mean,â€ replied
epictetus calmly. â€œi will cut your head off,â€ said his master. â€œhave i
said that my head could not be cut off?â€ a difficult person, epictetus.

what is this miracle by which a woman, even in your arms, may withdraw
herself, utterly disappear till what you hold is as inaccessible as the
face of a cliff?

â€œbe patient with me, dear,â€ she urged sweetly.

 â€œi know it is hard for
you. and i begin to see--a little--how terry was so driven to crime.â€

â€œoh, come, thatâ€™s a pretty hard word for it. after all, alima was
his wife, you know,â€ i urged, feeling at the moment a sudden burst of
sympathy for poor terry. for a man of his temperament--and habits--it
must have been an unbearable situation.

but ellador, for all her wide intellectual grasp, and the broad sympathy
in which their religion trained them, could not make allowance for
such--to her--sacrilegious brutality.

it was the more difficult to explain to her, because we three, in our
constant talks and lectures about the rest of the world, had naturally
avoided the seamy side; not so much from a desire to deceive, but from
wishing to put the best foot foremost for our civilization, in the face
of the beauty and comfort of theirs. also, we re

were right, or at least unavoidable, which we could readily see would be
repugnant to them, and therefore did not discuss. again there was much
of our worldâ€™s life which we, being used to it, had not noticed as
anything worth describing. and still further, there was about these
women a colossal innocence upon which many of the things we did say had
made no impression whatever.

i am thus explicit about it because it shows how unexpectedly strong
was the impression made upon ellador when she at last entered our
civilization.

she urged me to be patient, and i was patient. you see, i loved her so
much that even the restrictions she so firmly established left me much
happiness. we were lovers, and there is surely delight enough in that.

do not imagine that these young women utterly refused â€œthe great new
hope,â€ as they called it, that of dual parentage. for that they had
agreed to marry us, though the marrying part of it was a concession
to our prejudices rather than th

her duties, but so far higher that
there were no other duties, one might almost say. all their wide mutual
love, all the subtle interplay of mutual friendship and service,
the urge of progressive thought and invention, the deepest religious
emotion, every feeling and every act was related to this great central
power, to the river of life pouring through them, which made them the
bearers of the very spirit of god.

of all this i learned more and more--from their books, from talk,
especially from ellador. she was at first, for a brief moment, envious
of her friend--a thought she put away from her at once and forever.

â€œit is better,â€ she said to me. â€œit is much better that it has not come
to me yet--to us, that is. for if i am to go with you to your country,
we may have â€˜adventures by sea and land,â€™ as you say [and as in truth we
did], and it might not be at all safe for a baby. so we wonâ€™t try again,
dear, till it is safe--will we?â€

this was a hard saying for a very loving husba

nd.

â€œunless,â€ she went on, â€œif one is coming, you will leave me behind. you
can come back, you know--and i shall have the child.â€

then that deep ancient chill of male jealousy of even his own progeny
touched my heart.

â€œiâ€™d rather have you, ellador, than all the children in the world. iâ€™d
rather have you with me--on your own terms--than not to have you.â€

this was a very stupid saying. of course i would! for if she wasnâ€™t
there i should want all of her and have none of her. but if she went
along as a sort of sublimated sister--only much closer and warmer than
that, really--why i should have all of her but that one thing. and i
was beginning to find that elladorâ€™s friendship, elladorâ€™s comradeship,
elladorâ€™s sisterly affection,

 elladorâ€™s perfectly sincere love--none
the less deep that she held it back on a definite line of reserve--were
enough to live on very happily.

i find it quite beyond me to describe what this woman was to me. we talk
fine things about women, but in our hearts we know that they are very
limited beings--most of them. we honor them for their functional powers,
even while we dishonor them by our use of it; we honor them for their
carefully enforced virtue, even while we show by our own conduct how

-coming home to mother. i donâ€™t
mean the underflannels-and-doughnuts mother, the fussy person that waits
on you and spoils you and doesnâ€™t really know you. i mean the feeling
that a very little child would have, who had been lost--for ever so
long. it was a sense of getting home; of being clean and rested;
of safety and yet freedom; of love that was always there, warm like
sunshine in may, not hot like a stove or a featherbed--a love that
didnâ€™t irritate and didnâ€™t smother.

i looked at ellador as if i hadnâ€™t seen her before. â€œif you wonâ€™t go,â€
 i said, â€œiâ€™ll get terry to the coast and come back alone. you can let me
down a rope. and if you will go--why you blessed wonder-woman--i would
rather live with you all my life--like this--than to have any other
woman i ever saw, or any number of them, to do as i like with. will you
come?â€

she was keen for coming. so the plans went on. sheâ€™d have liked to wait
for that marvel of celisâ€™s, but terry had no such desire. he was

the highest slopes, and stayed there. before we left
he quite desperately longed to see her, but she would not come and he
could not go. they watched him like lynxes. (do lynxes watch any better
than mousing cats, i wonder!)

well--we had to get the flyer in order, and be sure there was enough
fuel left, though terry said we could glide all right, down to that
lake, once we got started. weâ€™d have gone gladly in a weekâ€™s time, of
course, but there was a great to-do all over the country about
elladorâ€™s leaving them. she had interviews with some of the leading
ethicists--wise women with still eyes, and with the best of the
teachers. there was a stir, a thrill, a deep excitement everywhere.

our teaching about the rest of the world has given them all a sense
of isolation, of remoteness, of being a little outlying sample of a
country, overlooked and forgotten among the family of nations. we had
called it â€œthe family of nations,â€ and they liked the phrase immensely.

they were deeply arou

sed on the subject of evolution; indeed, the whole
field of natural science drew them irresistibly. any number of them
would have risked everything to go to the strange unknown lands and
study; but we could take only one, and it had to be ellador, naturally.

we planned greatly about coming back, about establishing a connecting
route by water; about penetrating those vast forests and civilizing--or
exterminating--the dangerous savages. that is, we men talked of that
last--not with the women. they had a definite aversion to killing
things.

but meanwhile there was high council being held among the wisest of them
all. the students and thinkers who had been gathering facts from us all
this time, collating and relating them, and making infe

they were well posted as to the different races, beginning with their
poison-arrow natives down below and widening out to the broad racial
divisions we had told them about. never a shocked expression of the face
or exclamation of revolt had warned us; they had been extracting the
evidence without our knowing it all this time, and now were studying
with the most devout earnestness the matter they had prepared.

the result was rather distressing to us. they first explained the matter
fully to ellador, as she was the one who purposed visiting the rest
of the world. to celis they said nothing. she must not be in any way
distressed, while the whole nation waited on her great work.

finally jeff and i were called in. somel and zava were there, and
ellador, with many others that we knew.

they had a great globe, quite fairly mapped out from the small section
maps in that compendium of ours. they had the different peoples of the
earth roughly outlined, and their status in civilization indicated.

ed emotion.â€

this too was admitted.

â€œwe find also that in spite of the advance of democracy and the increase
of wealth, that there is still unrest and sometimes combat.â€

yes, yes, we admitted it all. we were used to these things and saw no
reason for so much seriousness.

â€œall things considered,â€ they said, and they did not say a hundredth
part of the things they were considering, â€œwe are unwilling to expose
our country to free communication with the rest of the world--as yet. if
ellador comes back, and we approve her report, it may be done later--but
not yet.

â€œso we have this to ask of you gentlemen [they knew that word was held
a title of honor with us], that you promise not in any way to betray the
location of this country until permission--after elladorâ€™s return.â€

jeff was perfectly satisfied. he thought they were quite right. he
always did. i never saw an alien become naturalized more quickly than
that man in herland.

i studied it awhile, thinking of the time they

â€™d have if some of our
contagions got loose there, and concluded they were right. so i agreed.

terry was the obstacle. â€œindeed i wonâ€™t!â€ he protested. â€œthe first
thing iâ€™ll do is to get an expedition fixed up to force an entrance into
ma-land.â€

â€œthen,â€ they said quite calmly, â€œhe must remain an absolute prisoner,
always.â€

â€œanesthesia would be kinder,â€ urged moadine.

â€œand safer,â€ added zava.

â€œhe will promise, i think,â€ said ellador.

and he did. with which agreement we at last left herland.
