 whatever he said released a burst of
laughter. even those who, like herself, were too far away to
hear, sent out antennÃ¦ of attention until the only person on
the beach not caught up in it was the young woman with
the string of pearls. perhaps from modesty of possession she
responded to each salvo of amusement by bending closer
over her list.
the man of the monocle and bottle spoke suddenly out
of the sky above rosemary.
â€˜you are a ripping swimmer.â€™
she demurred.
â€˜jolly good. my name is campion. here is a lady who says
she saw you in sorrento last week and knows who you are
and would so like to meet you.â€™
glancing around with concealed annoyance rosemary

saw the untanned people were waiting. reluctantly she got
up and went over to them.
â€˜mrs. abramsâ€”mrs. mckiscoâ€”mr. mckiscoâ€”mr.

dress. â€˜youâ€™re rosemary hoyt and i recognized you in

and who isnâ€™t. one man my husband had been particularly
nice to turned out to be a chief characterâ€”practically the
assistant hero.â€™
â€˜the plot?â€™ inquired rosemary, half understanding. â€˜is
there a plot?â€™
â€˜my dear, we donâ€™t know,â€™ said mrs. abrams, with a
convulsive, stout womanâ€™s chuckle. â€˜weâ€™re not in it. weâ€™re

mr. dumphry, a tow-headed effeminate young man, remarked:
â€˜mama abrams is a plot in herself,â€™ and campion
shook his monocle at him, saying: â€˜now, royal, donâ€™t be too
ghastly for words.â€™ rosemary looked at them all uncomfortably,
wishing her mother had come down here with her.
she did not like these people, especially in her immediate
comparison of them with those who had interested her at
the other end of the beach. her motherâ€™s modest but compact
social gift got them out of unwelcome situations swiftly
and firmly. but rosemary had been a celebrity for only six
months, and sometimes the fre

it a strand from the outer, darker sea. it seemed that

there was no life anywhere in all this expanse of coast except
under the filtered sunlight of those umbrellas, where
something went on amid the color and the murmur.

rosemary closed her eyes, pretending to be asleep; then
she half-opened them and watched two dim, blurred pillars
that were legs. the man tried to edge his way into a sandcolored
cloud, but the cloud floated off into the vast hot sky.
rosemary fell really asleep.
she awoke drenched with sweat to find the beach deserted
save for the man in the jockey cap, who was folding a last
umbrella. as rosemary lay blinking, he walked nearer and
said:

ngâ€”and this
is a flattering attention, for who looks at us?â€” glances fall
upon us, curious or disinterested, nothing more. his voice,
with some faint irish melody running through it, wooed the
world, yet she felt the layer of hardness in him, of self-control
and of self-discipline, her own virtues. oh, she chose
him, and nicole, lifting her head saw her choose him, heard
the little sigh at the fact that he was already possessed.
toward noon the mckiscos, mrs. abrams, mr. dumphry,
and signor campion came on the beach. they had brought
a new umbrella that they set up with side glances toward
the divers, and crept under with satisfied expressionsâ€”all
save mr. mckisco, who remained derisively without. in his
raking dick had passed near them and now he returned to
the umbrellas.
â€˜the two young men are reading the book of etiquette
together,â€™ he said in a low voice.
â€˜planning to mix wit de quality,â€™ said abe.

 of her, and she delighted in responding to
the eventual movement as if it had been an order.
nicole handed her husband the curious garment on
which she had been working. he went into the dressing tent
and inspired a commotion by appearing in a moment clad
in transparent black lace drawers. close inspection revealed
that actually they were lined with fleshcolored cloth.
â€˜well, if that isnâ€™t a pansys trick!â€™ exclaimed mr. mckisco
contemptuouslyâ€”then turning quickly to mr. dumphry
and mr. campion, he added, â€˜oh, i beg your pardon.â€™
rosemary bubbled with delight at the trunks. her na-
Ã¯vetÃ© responded whole-heartedly to the expensive simplicity
of the divers, unaware of its complexity and its lack of innocence,
unaware that it was all a selection of quality rather
than quantity from the run of the worldâ€™s bazaar; and that
the simplicity of behavior also, the nursery-like peace and
good will, the emphasis on the simpler virtues, was part of
a desperate bargain with the gods and had

the singing ceased and the children, their faces aglow
with the late sunshine, stood smiling calmly at their success.
rosemary was thinking that the villa diana was the
centre of the world. on such a stage some memorable thing
was sure to happen. she lighted up higher as the gate tinkled
open and the rest of the guests arrived in a bodyâ€”the
mckiscos, mrs. abrams, mr. dumphry, and mr. campion
came up to the terrace.
rosemary had a sharp feeling of disappointmentâ€”she
looked quickly at dick, as though to ask an explanation of
this incongruous mingling. but there was nothing unusual
in his expression. he greeted his new guests with a proud
bearing and an obvious deference to their infinite and
unknown possibilities. she believed in him so much that
presently she accepted the rightness of the mckiscosâ€™ presence
as if she had expected to meet them all along.
â€˜iâ€™ve met you in pari

quietly. he pretended not to have heard, as if the compliment
were purely formal.
â€˜new friends,â€™ he said, as if it were an important point,
â€˜can often have a better time together than old friends.â€™
with that remark, which she did not understand precisely,
she found herself at the table, picked out by slowly
emerging lights against the dark dusk. a chord of delight
struck inside her when she saw that dick had taken her
mother on his right hand; for herself she was between luis
campion and brady.
surcharged with her emotion she turned to brady with
the intention of confiding in him, but at her first mention
of dick a hard-boiled sparkle in his eyes gave her to understand
that he refused the fatherly office. in turn she
was equally firm when he tried to monopolize her hand,
so they talked shop or rather she listened while he talked
shop, her polite eyes never leaving his face, but her mind
was so definitely elsewhere that she felt he must guess the
fact. intermittently she cau

abe north was talking to her about his moral code: â€˜of

a moral code. mine is that iâ€™m against the burning of
witches. whenever they burn a witch i get all hot under the
collar.â€™ rosemary knew from brady that he was a musician
who after a brilliant and precocious start had composed
nothing for seven years.
next was campion, managing somehow to restrain his
most blatant effeminacy, and even to visit upon those near
him a certain disinterested motherliness. then mary north

his laughter swept them on up toward the terrace where
he delivered her to nicole... .
too soon it had become time to go and the divers helped
them all to go quickly. in the diversâ€™ big isotta there would
be tommy barban and his baggageâ€”he was spending the
night at the hotel to catch an early trainâ€”with mrs. abrams,
the mckiscos and campion. earl brady was going to drop
rosemary and her mother on his way to monte carlo, and
royal dumphry rode with them because the diversâ€™ car was

crowded. down in the garden lanterns still glowed over the
table where they had dined, as the divers stood side by side
in the gate, nicole blooming away and filling the night with
graciousness, and dick bidding good-by to everyone by
name. to rosemary it seemed very poignant to drive away
and leave them in their house. again she

time and far away. their children slept, their gate was shut
for the night.
she went inside and dressing in a light gown and espadrilles
went out her window again and along the continuous
terrace toward the front door, going fast since she found
that other private rooms, exuding sleep, gave upon it. she
stopped at the sight of a figure seated on the wide white
stairway of the formal entranceâ€”then she saw that it was
luis campion and that he was weeping.
he was weeping hard and quietly and shaking in the
same parts as a weeping woman. a scene in a role she had
played last year swept over her irresistibly and advancing
she touched him on the shoulder. he gave a little yelp before
he recognized her.
â€˜what is it?â€™ her eyes were level and kind and not slanted
into him with hard curiosity. â€˜can i help you?â€™
â€˜nobody can help me. i knew it. i have only myself to
blame. itâ€™s always the same.â€™

young than to love. itâ€™s happened to me before but never like
thisâ€”so accidentalâ€”just when everything was going well.â€™
his face was repulsive in the quickening light. not by a
flicker of her personality, a movement of the smallest muscle,
did she betray her sudden disgust with whatever it was.
but campionâ€™s sensitivity realized it and he changed the

subject rather suddenly.
â€˜abe north is around here somewhere.â€™
â€˜why, heâ€™s staying at the diversâ€™!â€™
â€˜yes, but heâ€™s upâ€”donâ€™t you know what happened?â€™
a shutter opened suddenly in a room two stories above
and an english voice spat distinctly:
â€˜will you kaindlay stup tucking!â€™
rosemary and luis campion went humbly down the
steps and to a bench beside the road to the beach.

eived them against the sky,
white over the sea. rosemary shook her head warningly before
he could speak and they moved another bench further
down the road. rosemary saw that abe was a little tight.
â€˜what are you doing up?â€™ he demanded.
â€˜i just got up.â€™ she started to laugh, but remembering the
voice above, she restrained herself.
â€˜plagued by the nightingale,â€™ abe suggested, and repeated,
â€˜probably plagued by the nightingale. has this
sewing-circle member told you what happened?â€™
campion said with dignity:
64 tender is the night
â€˜i only know what i heard with my own ears.â€™
he got up and walked swiftly away; abe sat down beside
rosemary.
â€˜why did you treat him so badly?â€™
â€˜did i?â€™ he asked surprised. â€˜heâ€™s been weeping around
here all morning.â€™
â€˜well, maybe heâ€™s sad about something.â€™
â€˜maybe he is.â€™
â€˜what about a duel? whoâ€™s going to duel? i thought there
was something strange in that car. is it true?â€™

, but itâ€™s more than thatâ€”youâ€™d
have to know the story. anyhow tommy is one of those men
that dickâ€™s passed along to nicole and when mrs. mckisco
kept hinting at her story, he called them on it. he said:
â€˜mrs. mckisco, please donâ€™t talk further about mrs. diver.â€™
â€˜i wasnâ€™t talking to you,â€™ she objected.
â€˜i think itâ€™s better to leave them out.â€™
â€˜are they so sacred?â€™
â€˜leave them out. talk about something else.â€™
he was sitting on one of the two little seats beside campion.
campion told me the story.

â€˜well, youâ€™re pretty high-handed,â€™ violet came back.
you know how conversations are in cars late at night,
some people murmuring and some not caring, giving up
after the party, or bored or asleep. well, none of them knew
just what happened until the car stopped and barban cried
in a voice that shook everybody, a voice for cavalry.
â€˜do you want to step out hereâ€”weâ€™re only a mile from
the hotel and you can walk it or iâ€™ll drag you t

thereâ€™s where he made his mistake because tommy, being
french, leaned over and clapped him one, and then the
chauffeur drove on. that was where you passed them. then
the women began. that was still the state of things when the
car got to the hotel.
tommy telephoned some man in cannes to act as second
and mckisco said he wasnâ€™t going to be seconded by
campion, who wasnâ€™t crazy for the job anyhow, so he telephoned
me not to say anything but to come right down.
violet mckisco collapsed and mrs. abrams took her to her
room and gave her a bromide whereupon she fell comfortably
asleep on the bed. when i got there i tried to argue with
tommy but the latter wouldnâ€™t accept anything short of an
apology and mckisco rather spunkily wouldnâ€™t give it.
when abe had finished rosemary asked thoughtfully:
â€˜do the divers know it was about them?â€™
â€˜noâ€”an

iâ€™d get out the old musical saw if he opened his mouth
about it. this fightâ€™s between two menâ€”what tommy needs
is a good war.â€™
â€˜i hope the divers donâ€™t find out,â€™ rosemary said.
abe peered at his watch.

he glanced at rosemaryâ€”and then said apologetically
to abe:
â€˜before we start thereâ€™s one thing iâ€™d like to see you about
alone.â€™

she found campion downstairs in the deserted lobby.
â€˜i saw you go upstairs,â€™ he said excitedly. â€˜is he all right?
when is the duel going to be?â€™
â€˜i donâ€™t know.â€™ she resented his speaking of it as a circus,
with mckisco as the tragic clown.
â€˜will you go with me?â€™ he demanded, with the air of having
seats. â€˜iâ€™ve hired the hotel car.â€™
â€˜i donâ€™t want to go.â€™
â€˜why not? i imagine itâ€™ll take years off my life but i
wouldnâ€™t miss it for worlds. we could watch it from quite

meâ€”you did much harder things for rainyâ€™s publicity

still rosemary did not see why she should go, but she
obeyed the sure, clear voice that had sent her into the stage
entrance of the odeon in paris when she was twelve and
greeted her when she came out again.
she thought she was reprieved when from the steps she
saw abe and mckisco drive awayâ€”but after a moment the
hotel car came around the corner. squealing delightedly
luis campion pulled her in beside him.
â€˜i hid there because they might not let us come. iâ€™ve got
my movie camera, you see.â€™
she laughed helplessly. he was so terrible that he was no
longer terrible, only dehumanized.
â€˜i wonder why mrs. mckisco didnâ€™t like the divers?â€™ she
said. â€˜they were very nice to her.â€™
â€˜oh, it wasnâ€™t that. it was something she saw. we never
did find exactly what it was because of barban.â€™

juan les pins, where the skeleton of the new casino was
rising. it was past four and under a blue-gray sky the first
fishing boats were creaking out into a glaucous sea. then
they turned off the main road and into the back country.
â€˜itâ€™s the golf course,â€™ cried campion, â€˜iâ€™m sure thatâ€™s where
itâ€™s going to be.â€™
he was right. when abeâ€™s car pulled up ahead of them
the east was crayoned red and yellow, promising a sultry
day. ordering the hotel car into a grove of pines rosemary
and campion kept in the shadow of a wood and skirted the
bleached fairway where abe and mckisco were walking
up and down, the latter raising his head at intervals like a
rabbit scenting. presently there were moving figures over
by a farther tee and the watchers made out barb

his arm.
somewhat appalled, mckisco slipped behind abe and
took a long swallow of brandy. he walked on choking and
would have marched directly up into the other party, but
abe stopped him and went forward to talk to the frenchman.
the sun was over the horizon.
campion grabbed rosemaryâ€™s arm.

much. this will cost meâ€”â€˜

frantic prayer in french.
the principals faced each other, barban with the sleeve
rolled up from his arm. his eyes gleamed restlessly in the
sun, but his motion was deliberate as he wiped his palm on

â€˜no, iâ€™ve got it. we were all in about the same danger.â€™
abe paid the doctor while mckisco suddenly turned into
the bushes and was sick there. then paler than before he
strutted on with abe toward the car through the now rosy
morning.
campion lay gasping on his back in the shrubbery, the
only casualty of the duel, while rosemary suddenly hysterical
with laughter kept kicking at him with her espadrille.
she did this persistently until she roused himâ€”the only
matter of importance to her now was that in a few hours she
would see the person whom she still referred to in her mind
as â€˜the diversâ€™ on the beach.
