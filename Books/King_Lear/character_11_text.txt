enter goneril and [her] steward [oswald].

  gon. did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?
  osw. ay, madam.
  gon. by day and night, he wrongs me! every hour
     he flashes into one gross crime or other
     that sets us all at odds. i'll not endure it.
     his knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us
     on every trifle. when he returns from hunting,
     i will not speak with him. say i am sick.
     if you come slack of former services,
     you shall do well; the fault of it i'll answer.
