ke it or leave it, captain lombard." 

he had said thoughtfully: 

"a hundred guineas, eh?" 

he had said it in a casual way as though a hundred guineas was nothing to him. 
a hundred guineas when he was literally down to his last square meal! he had 
fancied, though, that the little jew had not been deceived - that was the 
damnable part about jews, you couldn't deceive them about money - they knew! 

he had said in the same casual tone: 

"and you can't give me any further information?" 

mr. isaac morris had shaken his little bald head very positively. 

"no, captain lombard, the matter rests there. it is understood by my client that 
your reputation is that of a good man in a tight place. i am empowered to hand 
you one hundred guineas in return for which you will travel to sticklehaven, 
devon. the nearest station is oakbridge, you will be met there and motored to 
sticklehaven where a motor launch will convey you to indian island. there you 
will hold yourself at the disposal of my client."

 business - all of it." 

he considered for a minute or two. he said irritably: 



"do you mean to say that you haven't been able to get anything helpful out of the 
sticklehaven people. dash it, they must know something." 

inspector maine shrugged his shoulders. 

"they're ordinary decent seafaring folk. they know that the island was bought by 
a man called owen - and that's about all they do know." 

"who provisioned the island and made all the necessary arrangements?" 

"man called morris. isaac morris." 

"and what does he say about it all?" 

"he can't say anything, sir, he's dead." 

the a.c. frowned. 

"do we know anything abut this morris?" 

"oh, yes, sir, we know about him. he wasn't a very savoury gentleman, mr. 
morris. he was implicated in that share-pushing fraud of bennito's three years 
ago - we're sure of that though we can't prove it. and he was mixed up in the 
dope business. and again we can't prove it. he was a very careful man, morris." 

"and he was behind this island busi

and there were a lot of people, boy scouts and others on the cliffs looking out 
towards the island and watching." 

the a.c. sighed. he said: 

"what about the gramophone record you found in the house? couldn't you get 
hold of anything there that might help?" 

inspector maine said: 

"i've been into that. it was supplied by a firm that do a lot of theatrical stuff and 
film effects. it was sent to u.n. owen, esq. c/o isaac morris, and was understood 



to be required for the amateur performance of a hitherto unacted play. the 
typescript of it was returned with the record." 

legge said: 

"and what about the subject matter, eh?" 

inspector maine said gravely: 

"i'm coming to that, sir." 

he cleared his throat. 

"i've investigated those accusations as thoroughly as i can. 

"starting with the rogerses who were the first to arrive on the island. they were 
in service with a miss brady who died suddenly. can't get an

y, "was a bad hat!" 

"you think so, sir?" 

the a.c. said: 

"i always thought so. but he was clever enough to get away with it. it's my 
opinion that he committed black perjury in the landor case. i wasn't happy about 
it at the time. but i couldn't find anything. i put hams onto it and he couldn't 



find anything but i'm still of the opinion that there was something to find if we'd 
known how to set about it. the man wasn't straight." 

there was a pause, then sir thomas legge said: 

"and isaac morris is dead, you say? when did he die?" 

"i thought you'd soon come to that, sir. isaac morris died on the night of august 
8th. took an overdose of sleeping stuff - one of the barbiturates, i understand. 
there wasn't anything to show whether it was accident or suicide." 

legge said slowly: 

"care to know what i think, maine?" 

"perhaps i can guess, sir." 

legge said heavily: 

"that death of morris' is a damned sight too opportune!" 

inspector maine nodded. he said: 

"i thought you'd say t
