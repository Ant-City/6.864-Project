[CHARACTER] - 
                	a
man who rescues sebastian after his shipwreck. [CHARACTER] has become
very fond of sebastian, caring for him, accompanying him to illyria,
and furnishing him with money--all because of a love so strong that
it seems to be romantic in nature. [CHARACTER]'s attraction to sebastian,
however, never bears fruit. despite the ambiguous and shifting gender
roles in the play, twelfth night remains a romantic comedy in which
the characters are destined for marriage. in such a world, homoerotic
attraction cannot be fulfilled.
