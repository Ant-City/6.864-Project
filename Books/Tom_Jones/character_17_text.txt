gone abroad on a
visit with his mother. fear of the punishment he was to suffer was on
this occasion his least evil; his chief anxiety being, lest his
constancy should fail him, and he should be brought to betray the
gamekeeper, whose ruin he knew must now be the consequence.

nor did the gamekeeper pass his time much better. he had the same
apprehensions with the youth; for whose honour he had likewise a much
tenderer regard than for his skin.

in the morning, when tom attended the reverend mr thwackum, the person
to whom mr allworthy had committed the instruction of the two boys, he
had the same questions put to him by that gentleman which he had been
asked the evening before, to which he returned the same answers. the
consequence of this was, so severe a whipping, that it possibly fell
little short of the torture with which confessions are in some
countries extorted from criminals.

tom bore his punishment with great resolution; and though his master
asked him, between every stroke, whether
 
 ___________________________
 
 he would not confess, he was
contented to be flead rather than betray his friend, or break the
promise he had made.

the gamekeeper was now relieved from his anxiety, and mr allworthy
himself began to be concerned at tom‚Äôs sufferings: for besides that mr
thwackum, being highly enraged that he was not able to make the boy
say what he himself pleased, had carried his severity much beyond the
good man‚Äôs intention, this latter began now to suspect that the squire
had been mistaken; which his extreme eagerness and anger seemed to
make probable; and as for what the servants had said in confirmation
of their master‚Äôs account, he laid no great stress upon that. now, as
cruelty and injustice were two ideas of which mr allworthy could by no
means support the 
 
 ___________________________
 
consciousness a single moment, he sent for tom, and
after many kind and friendly exhortations, said, ‚Äúi am convinced, my
dear child, that my suspicions have wronged you; i am sorry that you
have been so severely punished on this account.‚Äù and at last gave him
a little horse to make him amends; again repeating his sorrow for what
had past.

tom‚Äôs guilt now flew in his face more than any severity could make it.
he could more easily bear the lashes of thwackum, than the generosity
of allworthy. the tears burst from his eyes, and he fell upon his
knees, crying, ‚Äúoh, sir, you are too good to me. indeed you are.
indeed i don‚Äôt deserve it.‚Äù and at that very instant, from the fulness
of his heart, had almost betrayed the secret; but the good genius of
the gamekeeper suggested to him what might be the consequence to the
poor fellow, and this consideration sealed his lips.

thwackum did all he could to persuade allworthy from showing any
compassion or
 
 ___________________________
 
 kindness to the boy, saying, ‚Äúhe had persisted in an
untruth;‚Äù and gave some hints, that a second whipping might probably
bring the matter to light.

but mr allworthy absolutely refused to consent to the experiment. he
said, the boy had suffered enough already for concealing the truth,
even if he was guilty, seeing that he could have no motive but a
mistaken point of honour for so doing.

‚Äúhonour!‚Äù cryed thwackum, with some warmth, ‚Äúmere stubbornness and
obstinacy! can honour teach any one to tell a lie, or can any honour
exist independent of religion?‚Äù

this discourse happened at table when dinner was just ended; and there
were present mr allworthy, mr thwackum, and a third gentleman, who now
entered into the debate, and whom, before we proceed any further, we
shall briefly introduce to our reader‚Äôs acquaintance.



chapter iii.

the character of mr square the philosopher, and of mr thwackum the

 
 ___________________________
 
, in
considering that great man rather in the quality of a philosopher or a
speculatist, than as a legislator. this sentiment he carried a great
way; indeed, so far, as to regard all virtue as matter of theory only.
this, it is true, he never affirmed, as i have heard, to any one; and
yet upon the least attention to his conduct, i cannot help thinking it
was his real opinion, as it will perfectly reconcile some
contradictions which might otherwise appear in his character.

this gentleman and mr thwackum scarce ever met without a disputation;
for their tenets were indeed diametrically opposite to each other.
square held human nature to be the perfection of all virtue, and that
vice was a deviation from our nature, in the same manner as deformity
of body is. thwackum, on the contrary, maintained that the human mind,
since the fall, was nothing but a sink of iniquity, till purified and
redeemed by grace. in one point only they agreed, which was, in all
their discourses on morality never to mentio
 
 ___________________________
 
a more vague and
uncertain signification, than the two he had mentioned; for that there
were almost as many different opinions concerning honour, as
concerning religion. ‚Äúbut,‚Äù says he, ‚Äúif by honour you mean the true
natural beauty of virtue, i will maintain it may exist independent of
any religion whatever. nay,‚Äù added he, ‚Äúyou yourself will allow it may
exist independent of all but one: so will a mahometan, a jew, and all
the maintainers of all the different sects in the world.‚Äù

thwackum replied, this was arguing with the usual malice of all the
enemies to the true church. he said, he doubted not but that all the
infidels and hereticks in the world would, if they could, confine
honour to their own absurd errors and damnable deceptions; ‚Äúbut
honour,‚Äù says he, ‚Äúis not therefore manifold, because there are many
absurd opinions about it; nor is religion manifold, because there are
various sects and heresies in the world. when i mention religion, i
mean the christian religion;
 
 ___________________________
 
tion? i have asserted, that true honour and true
virtue are almost synonymous terms, and they are both founded on the
unalterable rule of right, and the eternal fitness of things; to which
an untruth being absolutely repugnant and contrary, it is certain that
true honour cannot support an untruth. in this, therefore, i think we
are agreed; but that this honour can be said to be founded on
religion, to which it is antecedent, if by religion be meant any
positive law--‚Äù

‚Äúi agree,‚Äù answered thwackum, with great warmth, ‚Äúwith a man who
asserts honour to be antecedent to religion! mr allworthy, did i
agree--?‚Äù

he was proceeding when mr allworthy interposed, telling them very
coldly, they had both mistaken his meaning; for that he had said
nothing of true honour.--it is possible, however, he would not have
easily quieted the disputants, who were growing equally warm, had not
another matter now fallen out, which put a final end to the
conversation at present.



chapter iv.

containing a

ived to ridicule all alike. now the
reader will be pleased to consider, that, as neither of these men were
fools, they could not be supposed to have holden none but wrong
principles, and to have uttered nothing but absurdities; what
injustice, therefore, must i have done to their characters, had i
selected only what was bad! and how horribly wretched and maimed must
their arguments have appeared!

upon the whole, it is not religion or virtue, but the want of them,
which is here exposed. had not thwackum too much neglected virtue, and
square, religion, in the composition of their several systems, and had
not both utterly discarded all natural goodness of heart, they had
never been represented as the objects of derision in this history; in
which we will now proceed.

this matter then, which put an end to the debate mentioned in the last
chapter, was no other than a quarrel between master blifil and tom
jones, the consequence of which had been a bloody nose to the former;
for though master blifil
 
 ___________________________
 
, notwithstanding he was the younger, was in
size above the other‚Äôs match, yet tom was much his superior at the
noble art of boxing.

tom, however, cautiously avoided all engagements with that youth; for
besides that tommy jones was an inoffensive lad amidst all his
roguery, and really loved blifil, mr thwackum being always the second
of the latter, would have been sufficient to deter him.

but well says a certain author, no man is wise at all hours; it is
therefore no wonder that a boy is not so. a difference arising at play
between the two lads, master blifil called tom a beggarly bastard.
upon which the latter, who was somewhat passionate in his disposition,
immediately caused that phenomenon in the face of the former, which we
have above remembered.

master blifil now, with his blood running from 
 
 ___________________________
 
his nose, and the tears
galloping after from his eyes, appeared before his uncle and the
tremendous thwackum. in which court an indictment of assault, battery,
and wounding, was instantly preferred against tom; who in his excuse
only pleaded the provocation, which was indeed all the matter that
master blifil had omitted.

it is indeed possible that this circumstance might have escaped his
memory; for, in his reply, he positively insisted, that he had made
use of no such appellation; adding, ‚Äúheaven forbid such naughty words
should ever come out of his mouth!‚Äù

tom, though against all form of law, 
 
 ___________________________
 
rejoined in affirmance of the
words. upon which master blifil said, ‚Äúit is no wonder. those who will
tell one fib, will hardly stick at another. if i had told my master
such a wicked fib as you have done, i should be ashamed to show my
face.‚Äù

‚Äúwhat fib, child?‚Äù cries thwackum pretty eagerly.

‚Äúwhy, he told you that nobody was with him a shooting when he killed
the partridge; but he knows‚Äù (here he burst into a flood of tears),
‚Äúyes, he knows, for he confessed it to me, that black george the
gamekeeper was there. nay, he said--yes you did--deny it if you can,
that you would not have confest the truth, though master had cut you
to pieces.‚Äù

at this the fire flashed from thwackum‚Äôs eyes, and he cried out in
triumph--‚Äúoh! ho! this is your mistaken notion of

 a few moments, and then dismissed the boys,
advising them to live more friendly and peaceably together.



chapter v.

the opinions of the divine and the philosopher concerning the two
boys; with some reasons for their opinions, and other matters.


it is probable, that by disclosing this secret, which had been
communicated in the utmost confidence to him, young blifil preserved
his companion from a good lashing; for the offence of the bloody nose
would have been of itself sufficient cause for thwackum to have
proceeded to correction; but now this was totally absorbed in the
consideration of the other matter; and with regard to this, mr
allworthy declared privately, he thought the boy deserved reward
rather than punishment, so that thwackum‚Äôs hand was withheld by a
general pardon.

thwackum, whose meditations were full of birch, exclaimed against this
weak, and, as he said he would venture to call it, wicked lenity. to
remit the punishment of such crimes was, he said, to encourage them.
he

f to the vice of
lying, on which head he was altogether as learned as he had been on
the other.

square said, he had been endeavouring to reconcile the behaviour of
tom with his idea of perfect virtue, but could not. he owned there was
something which at first sight appeared like fortitude in the action;
but as fortitude was a virtue, and falsehood a vice, they could by no
means agree or unite together. he added, that as this was in some
measure to confound virtue and vice, it might be worth mr thwackum‚Äôs
consideration, whether a larger castigation might not be laid on upon
the account.

as both these learned men concurred in censuring jones, so were they
no less unanimous in applauding master blifil. to bring truth to
light, was by the parson asserted to be the duty of every religious
man; and by the philosopher this was declared to be highly conformable
with the rule of right, and the eternal and unalterable fitness of
things.

all this, however, weighed very little with mr allworthy. he c
 
 ___________________________
 
ould not
be prevailed on to sign the warrant for the execution of jones. there
was something within his own breast with which the invincible fidelity
which that youth had preserved, corresponded much better than it had
done with the religion of thwackum, or with the virtue of square. he
therefore strictly ordered the former of these gentlemen to abstain
from laying violent hands on tom for what had past. the pedagogue was
obliged to obey those orders; but not without great reluctance, and
frequent mutterings that the boy would be certainly spoiled.

towards the gamekeeper the good man behaved with more severity. he
presently summoned that poor fellow before him, and after many bitter
remonstrances, paid him his wages, and dismist him from his 
 
 ___________________________
 
service;
for mr allworthy rightly observed, that there was a great difference
between being guilty of a falsehood to excuse yourself, and to excuse
another. he likewise urged, as the principal motive to his inflexible
severity against this man, that he had basely suffered tom jones to
undergo so heavy a punishment for his sake, whereas he ought to have
prevented it by making the discovery himself.

when this story became public, many people differed from square and
thwackum, in judging the conduct of the two lads on the occasion.
master blifil was generally called a sneaking rascal, a poor-spirited
wretch, with other epithets of the like kind; whilst tom was honoured
with the appellations of a brave lad, a jolly dog, and an honest
fellow. indeed, his behaviour to black george much ingratiated him
with all the servants; for though that fellow was before universally
disliked, yet he was no sooner turned away than he was as universally
pitied; and the friendship and 
 
 ___________________________
 
gallantry of tom jones was celebrated
by them all with the highest applause; and they condemned master
blifil as openly as they durst, without incurring the danger of
offending his mother. for all this, however, poor tom smarted in the
flesh; for though thwackum had been inhibited to exercise his arm on
the foregoing account, yet, as the proverb says, it is easy to find a
stick, &c. so was it easy to find a rod; and, indeed, the not being
able to find one was the only thing which could have kept thwackum any
long time from chastising poor jones.

had the bare delight in the sport been the only inducement to the
pedagogue, it is probable master blifil would likewise have had his
share; but though mr allworthy had given him frequent orders to make
no dif
 
 ___________________________
 
ference between the lads, yet was thwackum altogether as kind
and gentle to this youth, as he was harsh, nay even barbarous, to the
other. to say the truth, blifil had greatly gained his master‚Äôs
affections; partly by the profound respect he always showed his
person, but much more by the decent reverence with which he received
his doctrine; for he had got by heart, and frequently repeated, his
phrases, and maintained all his master‚Äôs religious principles with a
zeal which was surprizing in one so young, and which greatly endeared
hi
 
 ___________________________
 
s approach; but was altogether as unmindful both of his
master‚Äôs precepts and example. he was indeed a thoughtless, giddy
youth, with little sobriety in his manners, and less in his
countenance; and would often very impudently and indecently laugh at
his companion for his serious behaviour.

mr square had the same reason for his preference of the former lad;
for tom jones showed no more regard to the learned discourses which
this gentleman would sometimes throw away upon him, than to those of
thwackum. he once ventured to make a jest of the rule of right; and at
another time said, he believed there was no rule in the world capable
of making such a man as his father (for so mr allworthy suffered
himself to be called).

master blifil, on the contrary, had address enough at sixteen to
recommend himself at one and the same time to both these opposites.
with one he was all religion, with the other he was all virtue. and
when both were present, he was profoundly silent, which both
interpreted in h
 
 ___________________________
 
is favour and in their own.

nor was blifil contented with flattering both these gentlemen to their
faces; he took frequent occasions of praising them behind their backs
to allworthy; before whom, when they two were alone, and his uncle
commended any religious or virtuous sentiment (for many such came
constantly from him) he seldom failed to ascribe it to the good
instructions he had received from either thwackum or square; for he
knew his uncle repeated all such compliments to the persons for whose
use they were meant; and he found by experience the great impressions
which they made on the philosopher, as well as on the divine: for, to
say the truth, there is no kind of flattery so irresistible as this,
at second hand.

the young gentleman, moreover, soon perceived how extremely grateful
all those panegyrics on his instructors were to mr allworthy himself,
as they so loudly resounded the praise of that
 
 ___________________________
 
 this worthy man having observed
the imperfect institution of our public schools, and the many vices
which boys were there liable to learn, had resolved to educate his
nephew, as well as the other lad, whom he had in a manner adopted, in
his own house; where he thought their morals would escape all that
danger of being corrupted to which they would be unavoidably exposed
in any public school or university.

having, therefore, determined to commit these boys to the tuition of a
private tutor, mr thwackum was recommended to him for that office, by
a very particular friend, of whose understanding mr allworthy had a
great opinion, and in whose integrity he placed much confidence. this
thwackum was fellow of a college, where he almost entirely resided;
and had a great reputation for learning, religion, and sobriety of
manners. and these were doubtless the qualifications by which mr
allworthy‚Äôs friend had been induced to recommend him; though indeed
this friend had some obligations to thwackum‚Äôs

 family, who were the
most considerable persons in a borough which that gentleman
represented in parliament.

thwackum, at his first arrival, was extremely agreeable to allworthy;
and indeed he perfectly answered the character which had been given of
him. upon longer acquaintance, however, and more intimate
conversation, this worthy man saw infirmities in the tutor, which he
could have wished him to have been without; though as those seemed
greatly overbalanced by his good qualities, they did not incline mr
allworthy to part with him: nor would they indeed have justified such
a proceeding; for the reader is gre
 
 ___________________________
 
atly mistaken, if he conceives that
thwackum appeared to mr allworthy in the same light as he doth to him
in this history; and he is as much deceived, if he imagines that the
most intimate acquaintance which he himself could have had with that
divine, would have informed him of those things which we, from our
inspiration, are enabled to open and discover. of readers who, from
such conceits as these, condemn the wisdom or penetration of mr
allworthy, i shall not scruple to say, that they make a very bad and
ungrateful use of that knowledge
 
 ___________________________
 
 which we have communicated to them.

these apparent errors in the doctrine of thwackum served greatly to
palliate the contrary errors in that of square, which our good man no
less saw and condemned. he thought, indeed, that the different
exuberancies of these gentlemen would correct their different
imperfections; and that from both, especially with his assistance, the
two lads would derive sufficient precepts of true religion and virtue.
if the event happened contrary to his expectations, this possibly
proceeded from some fault in the plan itself; which the reader hath my

 moreover, now a little descended into the vale of
years; but in reality bosom friends, and intimate acquaintance, have a
kind of natural propensity to particular females at the house of a
friend--viz., to his grandmother, mother, sister, daughter, aunt,
niece, or cousin, when they are rich; and to his wife, sister,
daughter, niece, cousin, mistress, or servant-maid, if they should be
handsome.

we would not, however, have our reader imagine, that persons of such
characters as were supported by thwackum and square, would undertake a
matter of this kind, which hath been a little censured by some rigid
moralists, before they had thoroughly examined it, and considered
whether it was (as shakespear phrases it) ‚Äústuff o‚Äô th‚Äô conscience,‚Äù
 or no. thwackum was encouraged to the undertaking by reflecting that
to covet your neighbour‚Äôs sister is nowhere forbidden: and he knew it
was a rule in the construction of all laws, that ‚Äú_expressum facit
cessare tacitum._‚Äù the sense of which is, ‚Ä

ere industrious in taking every
opportunity of recommending themselves to the widow, they apprehended
one certain method was, by giving her son the constant preference to
the other lad; and as they conceived the kindness and affection which
mr allworthy showed the latter, must be highly disagreeable to her,
they doubted not but the laying hold on all occasions to degrade and
vilify him, would be highly pleasing to her; who, as she hated the
boy, must love all those who did him any hurt. in this thwackum had
the advantage; for while square could only scarify the poor lad‚Äôs
reputation, he could flea his skin; and, indeed, he considered every
lash he gave him as a compliment paid to his mistress; so that he
could, with the utmost propriety, repeat this old flogging line,
_‚Äúcastigo te non quod odio habeam, sed quod_ amem. i chastise thee not
out of hatred, but out of love.‚Äù and this, indeed, he often had in his
mouth, or rather, according to the old phrase, never more properly
applied, at hi

le of this regard, that in his infancy she seldom saw her son, or
took any notice of him; and hence she acquiesced, after a little
reluctance, in all the favours which mr allworthy showered on the
foundling; whom the good man called his own boy, and in all things put
on an entire equality with master blifil. this acquiescence in mrs
blifil was considered by the neighbours, and by the family, as a mark
of her condescension to her brother‚Äôs humour, and she was imagined by
all others, as well as thwackum and square, to hate the foundling in
her heart; nay, the more civility she showed him, the more they
conceived she detested him, and the surer schemes she was laying for
his ruin: for as they thought it her interest to hate him, it was very
difficult for her to persuade them she did not.

thwackum was the more confirmed in his opinion, as she had more than
once slily caused him to whip tom jones, when mr allworthy, who was an
enemy to this exercise, was abroad; whereas she had never given any
s
 
 ___________________________
 
uch orders concerning young blifil. and this had likewise imposed
upon square. in reality, though she certainly hated her own son--of
which, however monstrous it appears, i am assured she is not a
singular instance--she appeared, notwithstanding all her outward
compliance, to be in her heart sufficiently displeased with all the
favour shown by mr allworthy to the foundling. she frequently
complained of this behind her brother‚Äôs back, and very sharply
censured him for it, both to thwackum and square; nay, she would throw
it in the teeth of allworthy himself, when a little quarrel, or miff,
as it is vulgarly called, arose between them.

however, when tom grew up, and gave tokens of that gallantry of temper
which greatly recommends men to women, this disinclination which she
had discovered to him when a child, by degrees abated, and at last she
so evidently demonstrated her affection to him to be much stronger
than what she bore her own son, that it was impossible to mistake her
a

ny longer. she was so desirous of often seeing him, and discovered
such satisfaction and delight in his company, that before he was
eighteen years old he was become a rival to both square and thwackum;
and what is worse, the whole country began to talk as loudly of her
inclination to tom, as they had before done of that which she had
shown to square: on which account the philosopher conceived the most
implacable hatred for our poor heroe.



chapter vii.

in which the author himself makes his appearance on the stage.


though mr allworthy was not of himself hasty to see things in a
disadvantageous light, and was a stranger to the public voice, which
seldom reaches to a brother or a husband, 
 
 ___________________________
 
and this, as i could
not prevail on any of my actors to speak, i myself was obliged to
declare.



chapter viii.

a childish incident, in which, however, is seen a good-natured
disposition in tom jones.


the reader may remember that mr allworthy gave tom jones a little
horse, as a kind of smart-money for the punishment which he imagined
he had suffered innocently.

this horse tom kept above half a year, and then rode him to a
neighbouring fair, and sold him.

at his return, being questioned by thwackum what he had done with the
money for which the horse was sold, he frankly declared he would not
tell him.

‚Äúoho!‚Äù says thwackum, ‚Äúyou will not! then i will have it out of your
br--h;‚Äù that being the place to which he always applied for
information on every doubtful occasion.

tom was now mounted on the back of a footman, and everything prepared
for execution, when mr allworthy, entering the room, gave the criminal
a reprieve, and took him with him into another apartment; where, being
alo
 
 ___________________________
 
ne with tom, he put the same question to him which thwackum had
before asked him.

tom answered, he could in duty refuse him nothing; but as for that
tyrannical rascal, he would never make him any other answer than with
a cudgel, with which he hoped soon to be able to pay him for all his
barbarities.

mr allworthy very severely reprimanded the lad for his indecent and
disrespectful expressions concerning his master; but much more for his
avowing an intention of revenge. he threatened him with the entire
loss of his favour, if he ever heard such another 
 
 ___________________________
 
word from his mouth;
for, he said, he would never support or befriend a reprobate. by these
and the like declarations, he extorted some compunction from tom, in
which that youth was not over-sincere; for he really meditated some
return for all the smarting favours he had received at the hands of
the pedagogue. he was, however, brought by mr allworthy to express a
concern for his resentment against thwackum; and then the good man,
after some wholesome admonition, permitted him to proceed, which he
did as follows:--

‚Äúindeed, my dear sir, i love and honour you more than all the world: i
know the great obligations i have to you, and should detest myself if
i thought my heart was capable of ingratitude. could the little horse
you gave me speak, i am sure he could tell you how fond i was of your
present; for i had more pleasure in feeding him than in riding him.
indeed, sir, it went to my heart to p
 
 ___________________________
 
ion i
parted with your dear present, notwithstanding all the value i had for
it: i sold the horse for them, and they have every farthing of the
money.‚Äù

mr allworthy now stood silent for some moments, and before he spoke
the tears started from his eyes. he at length dismissed tom with a
gentle rebuke, advising him for the future to apply to him in cases of
distress, rather than to use extraordinary means of relieving them
himself.

this affair was afterwards the subject of much debate between thwackum
and square. thwackum held, that this was flying in mr allworthy‚Äôs
face, who had intended to punish the fellow for his disobedience. he
said, in some instances, what the world called charity appeared to him
to be opposing the will of the almighty, which had marked some
particular persons for destruction; and that this was in like manner
acting in opposition to mr allworthy; concluding, as usual, with a
hearty recommendation of birch.

square argued strongly on the other side, in opposition per
 
 ___________________________
 
haps to
thwackum, or in compliance with mr allworthy, who seemed very much to
approve what jones had done. as to what he urged on this occasion, as
i am convinced most of my readers will be much abler advocates for
poor jones, it would be impertinent to relate it. indeed it was not
difficult to reconcile to the rule of right an action which it would
have been impossible to deduce from the rule of wrong.



chapter ix.

containing an incident of a more heinous kind, with the comments of
thwackum and square.


it hath been observed by some man of much greater reputation for
wisdom than myself, that misfortunes seldom come single. an instance
of this may, i believe, be seen in those gentlemen who have the
misfortune to have any of their rogueries detected; for here discovery
seldom stops till the whole is come out. thus it happened to poor tom;
who was no sooner pardoned for selling the horse, than he was
discovered to have some time before sold a fine bible which mr
allworthy gave him, 
 
 ___________________________
 
 at half-price. he therefore
deposited the said half-price himself; for he was a very prudent lad,
and so careful of his money, that he had laid up almost every penny
which he had received from mr allworthy.

some people have been noted to be able to read in no book but their
own. on the contrary, from the time when master blifil was first
possessed of this bible, he never used any other. nay, he was seen
reading in it much oftener than he had before been in his own. now, as
he frequently asked thwackum to explain difficult passages to him,
that gentleman unfortunately took notice of tom‚Äôs name, which was
written in many parts of the book. this brought on an inquiry, which
obliged master blifil to discover the whole matter.

thwackum was resolved a crime of this kind, which he called sacrilege,
should not go unpunished. he therefore proceeded immediately to
castigation: and not contented with that he acquainted mr allworthy,
at their next meeting, with this monstrous crime, as it appeared to
 
 ___________________________
 

him: inveighing against tom in the most bitter terms, and likening him
to the buyers and sellers who were driven out of the temple.

square saw this matter in a very different light. he said, he could
not perceive any higher crime in selling one book than in selling
another. that to sell bibles was strictly lawful by all laws both
divine and human, and consequently there was no unfitness in it. he
told thwackum, that his great concern on this occasion brought to his
mind the story of a very devout woman, who, out of pure regard to
religion, stole tillotson‚Äôs sermons from a lady of her acquaintance.

this story caused a vast quantity of blood to rush into the parson‚Äôs
face, which of itself was none of the palest; and he was going to
reply with great warmth and anger, had not mrs blifil, who was present
at this debate, interposed. that lady declared herself absolutely of
mr square‚Äôs side. she argu
 
 ___________________________
 
ed, indeed, very learnedly in support of his
opinion; and concluded with saying, if tom had been guilty of any
fault, she must confess her own son appeared to be equally culpable;
for that she could see no difference between the buyer and the seller;
both of whom were alike to be driven out of the temple.

mrs blifil having declared her opinion, put an end to the debate.
square‚Äôs triumph would almost have stopt his words, had he needed
them; and thwackum, who, for reasons before-mentioned, durst not

chapter x.

in which master blifil and jones appear in different lights.


master blifil fell very short of his companion in the amiable quality
of mercy; but he as greatly exceeded him in one of a much higher kind,
namely, in justice: in which he followed both the precepts and example
of thwackum and square; for though they would both make frequent use
of the word mercy, yet it was plain that in reality square held it to
be inconsistent with the rule of right; and thwackum was for doing
justice, and leaving mercy to heaven. the two gentlemen did indeed
somewhat differ in opinion concerning the objects of this sublime
virtue; by which thwackum would probably have destroyed one half of
mankind, and square the other half.

master blifil then, though he had kept silence in the presence of

y express any such disgust, it would
be an ill office in us to pay a visit to the inmost recesses of his
mind, as some scandalous people search into the most secret affairs of
their friends, and often pry into their closets and cupboards, only to
discover their poverty and meanness to the world.

however, as persons who suspect they have given others cause of
offence, are apt to conclude they are offended; so sophia imputed an
action of master blifil to his anger, which the superior sagacity of
thwackum and square discerned to have arisen from a much better
principle.

tom jones, when very young, had presented sophia with a little bird,
which he had taken from the nest, had nursed up, and taught to sing.

of this bird, sophia, then about thirteen years old, was so extremely
fond, that her chief business was to feed and tend it, and her chief
pleasure to play with it. by these means little tommy, for so the bird
was called, was become so tame, that it would feed out of the hand of
its mistress,

plumped over head and ears into the water.

sophia‚Äôs concern now changed its object. and as she apprehended the
boy‚Äôs life was in danger, she screamed ten times louder than before;
and indeed master blifil himself now seconded her with all the
vociferation in his power.

the company, who were sitting in a room next the garden, were
instantly alarmed, and came all forth; but just as they reached the
canal, tom (for the water was luckily pretty shallow in that part)
arrived safely on shore.

thwackum fell violently on poor tom, who stood dropping and shivering
before him, when mr allworthy desired him to have patience; and
turning to master blifil, said, ‚Äúpray, child, what is the reason of
all this disturbance?‚Äù

master blifil answered, ‚Äúindeed, uncle, i am very sorry for what i
have done; i have been unhappily the occasion of it all. i had miss
sophia‚Äôs bird in my hand, and thinking the poor creature languished
for liberty, i own i could not forbear giving it what it desired; for

s arrived at a capacity of distinguishing right
from wrong. to confine anything, seems to me against the law of
nature, by which everything hath a right to liberty. these were his
words; and the impression they have made on me is never to be
eradicated. can any man have a higher notion of the rule of right, and
the eternal fitness of things? i cannot help promising myself, from
such a dawn, that the meridian of this youth will be equal to that of
either the elder or the younger brutus.‚Äù

here thwackum hastily interrupted, and spilling some of his wine, and
swallowing the rest with great eagerness, answered, ‚Äúfrom another
expression he made use of, i hope he will resemble much better men.
the law of nature is a jargon of words, which means nothing. i know
not of any such law, nor of any right which can be derived from it. to
do as we would be done by, is indeed a christian motive, as the boy
well expressed himself; and i am glad to find my instructions have
borne such good fruit.‚Äù

opinion so openly, that if he was now silent,
he must submit to have his judgment censured. he said, therefore, with
some warmth, ‚Äúthat mr allworthy had too much respect to the dirty
consideration of property. that in passing our judgments on great and
mighty actions, all private regards should be laid aside; for by
adhering to those narrow rules, the younger brutus had been condemned
of ingratitude, and the elder of parricide.‚Äù

‚Äúand if they had been hanged too for those crimes,‚Äù cried thwackum,
‚Äúthey would have had no more than their deserts. a couple of
heathenish villains! heaven be praised we have no brutuses now-a-days!
i wish, mr square, you would desist from filling the minds of my
pupils with such antichristian stuff; for the consequence must be,
while they are under my care, its being well scourged out of them
again. there is your disciple tom almost spoiled already. i overheard
him the other day disputing with master blifil that there was no merit
in faith without works. i

 know that is one of your tenets, and i
suppose he had it from you.‚Äù

‚Äúdon‚Äôt accuse me of spoiling him,‚Äù says square. ‚Äúwho taught him to
laugh at whatever is virtuous and decent, and fit and right in the
nature of things? he is your own scholar, and i disclaim him. no, no,
master blifil is my boy. young as he is, that lad‚Äôs notions of moral
rectitude i defy you ever to eradicate.‚Äù

thwackum put on a contemptuous sneer at this, and replied, ‚Äúay, ay, i
will venture him with you. he is too well grounded for all your
philosophical cant to hurt. no, no, i have taken care to instil such
principles into him--‚Äù

‚Äúand i have instilled principles into him too,‚Äù cries square. ‚Äúwhat
but the sublime idea of virtue could inspire a human mind with the
generous thought of giving liberty? and i repeat to you again, if it
was a fit thing to be proud, i might claim the honour of having

‚Äúand if pride was not forbidden,‚Äù said thwackum, ‚Äúi might boast of
having taught him that duty which he himself assigned as his motive.‚Äù

‚Äúso between you both,‚Äù says the squire, ‚Äúthe young gentleman hath been
taught to rob my daughter of her bird. i find i must take care of my
partridge-mew. i shall have some virtuous religious man or other set
all my partridges at liberty.‚Äù then slapping a gentleman of the law,
who was present, on the back, he cried out, ‚Äúwhat say you to this, mr
counsellor? is not this against law?‚Äù

ellow should love another.‚Äù young blifil was greatly enraged
at it. he had long hated black george in the same proportion as jones
delighted in him; not from any offence which he had ever received, but
from his great love to religion and virtue;--for black george had the
reputation of a loose kind of a fellow. blifil therefore represented
this as flying in mr allworthy‚Äôs face; and declared, with great
concern, that it was impossible to find any other motive for doing
good to such a wretch.

thwackum and square likewise sung to the same tune. they were now
(especially the latter) become greatly jealous of young jones with the
widow; for he now approached the age of twenty, was really a fine
young fellow, and that lady, by her encouragements to him, seemed
daily more and more to think him so.

allworthy was not, however, moved with their malice. he declared
himself very well satisfied with what jones had done. he said the
perseverance and integrity of his friendship was highly commendable,

hing escapes, a penetration which nothing can deceive, and an
integrity which nothing can corrupt.

this active principle may perhaps be said to constitute the most
essential barrier between us and our neighbours the brutes; for if
there be some in the human shape who are not under any such dominion,
i choose rather to consider them as deserters from us to our
neighbours; among whom they will have the fate of deserters, and not
be placed in the first rank.

our heroe, whether he derived it from thwackum or square i will not
determine, was very strongly under the guidance of this principle; for
though he did not always act rightly, yet he never did otherwise
without feeling and suffering for it. it was this which taught him,
that to repay the civilities and little friendships of hospitality by
robbing the house where you have received them, is to be the basest
and meanest of thieves. he did not think the baseness of this offence
lessened by the height of the injury committed; on the contrary, i

in the guilty person, as clearly indeed as if there had been no
mixture of vice in the same character. while he was angry therefore
with the incontinence of jones, he was no less pleased with the honour
and honesty of his self-accusation. he began now to form in his mind
the same opinion of this young fellow, which, we hope, our reader may
have conceived. and in balancing his faults with his perfections, the
latter seemed rather to preponderate.

it was to no purpose, therefore, that thwackum, who was immediately
charged by mr blifil with the story, unbended all his rancour against
poor tom. allworthy gave a patient hearing to their invectives, and
then answered coldly: ‚Äúthat young men of tom‚Äôs complexion were too
generally addicted to this vice; but he believed that youth was
sincerely affected with what he had said to him on the occasion, and
he hoped he would not transgress again.‚Äù so that, as the days of
whipping were at an end, the tutor had no other vent but his own mout

for his gall, the usual poor resource of impotent revenge.

but square, who was a less violent, was a much more artful man; and as
he hated jones more perhaps than thwackum himself did, so he contrived
to do him more mischief in the mind of mr allworthy.

the reader must remember the several little incidents of the
partridge, the horse, and the bible, which were recounted in the
second book. by all which jones had rather improved than injured the
affection which mr allworthy was inclined to entertain for him. the
same, i believe, must have happened to him with every other person who
hath any idea of friendship, generosity, and greatness of spirit, that
is to say, 
 
 ___________________________
 
who hath any traces of goodness in his mind.

square himself was not unacquainted with the true impression which
those several instances of goodness had made on the excellent heart of
allworthy; for the philosopher very well knew what virtue was, though
he was not always perhaps steady in its pursuit; but as for thwackum,
from what reason i will not determine, no such thoughts ever entered
into his head: he saw jones in a bad light, and he imagined allworthy
saw him in the same, but that he was resolved, from pride and
stubbornness of spirit, not to give up the boy whom he had once
cherished; since by so doing, he must tacitly acknowledge that his
former opinion of him had been wrong.

square therefore embraced this opportunity of injuring jones
in the tenderest part, by giving a very bad turn to all these
befo

e the caution which he
prescribed for his future behaviour; ‚Äúon which alone,‚Äù he assured him,
‚Äúwould depend his own felicity, and the kindness which he might yet
promise himself to receive at the hands of his father by adoption,
unless he should hereafter forfeit his good opinion: for as to what
had past,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúit should be all forgiven and forgotten. he
therefore advised him to make a good use of this accident, that so in
the end it might prove a visitation for his own good.‚Äù

thwackum was likewise pretty assiduous in his visits; and he too
considered a sick-bed to be a convenient scene for lectures. his
stile, however, was more severe than mr allworthy‚Äôs: he told his
pupil, ‚Äúthat he ought to look on his broken limb as a judgment from
heaven on his sins. that it would become him to be daily on his knees,
pouring forth thanksgivings that he had broken his arm only, and not
his neck; which latter,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwas very probably reserved for some
future occasion, and that,

s the worst consequence of
such accidents, was the most contemptible thing in the world;‚Äù with
more of the like sentences, extracted out of the second book of
tully‚Äôs tusculan questions, and from the great lord shaftesbury. in
pronouncing these he was one day so eager, that he unfortunately bit
his tongue; and in such a manner, that it not only put an end to his
discourse, but created much emotion in him, and caused him to mutter
an oath or two: but what was worst of all, this accident gave
thwackum, who was present, and who held all such doctrine to be
heathenish and atheistical, an opportunity to clap a judgment on his
back. now this was done with so malicious a sneer, that it totally
unhinged (if i may so say) the temper of the philosopher, which the
bite of his tongue had somewhat ruffled; and as he was disabled from
venting his wrath at his lips, he had possibly found a more violent
method of revenging himself, had not the surgeon, who was then luckily
in the room, contrary to his own

 interest, interposed and preserved
the peace.

mr blifil visited his friend jones but seldom, and never alone. this
worthy young man, however, professed much regard for him, and as great
concern at his misfortune; but cautiously avoided any intimacy, lest,
as he frequently hinted, it might contaminate the sobriety of his own
character: for which purpose he had constantly in his mouth that
proverb in which solomon speaks against evil communication. not that
he was so bitter as thwackum; for he always expressed some hopes of
tom‚Äôs reformation; ‚Äúwhich,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthe unparalleled goodness shown
by his uncle on this occasion, must certainly effect in one not
absolutely abandoned:‚Äù but concluded, ‚Äúif mr jones ever offends
hereafter, i shall not be able to say a syllable in his favour.‚Äù

he was engaged either in the field or over his bottle. nay, he would
sometimes retire hither to take his beer, a

that when it is denied a vent in one part, it will certainly break out
in another. what her lips, therefore, concealed, her eyes, her
blushes, and many little involuntary actions, betrayed.

one day, when sophia was playing on the harpsichord, and jones was
attending, the squire came into the room, crying, ‚Äúthere, tom, i have
had a battle for thee below-stairs with thick parson thwackum. he hath
been a telling allworthy, before my face, that the broken bone was a
judgment upon thee. d--n it, says i, how can that be? did he not come
by it in defence of a young woman? a judgment indeed! pox, if he never
doth anything worse, he will go to heaven sooner than all the parsons
in the country. he hath more reason to glory in it than to be ashamed
of it.‚Äù--‚Äúindeed, sir,‚Äù says jones, ‚Äúi have no reason for either; but

square, ‚Äúi profess they always appeared so to me.‚Äù--‚Äúand yet,‚Äù said
jones, ‚Äúyou was of a different opinion when my affair with this girl
was first discovered.‚Äù--‚Äúwhy, i must confess,‚Äù says square, ‚Äúas the
matter was misrepresented to me, by that parson thwackum, i might
condemn the corruption of innocence: it was that, sir, it was
that--and that--: for you must know, mr jones, in the consideration of
fitness, very minute circumstances, sir, very minute circumstances
cause great alteration.‚Äù--‚Äúwell,‚Äù cries jones, ‚Äúbe that as it will, it

more of this adventure. behave kindly to the girl, and i will never

d mr jones, whom the reader hath just
parted from at mr western‚Äôs, and who received this summons just as
sophia had left him.

the news of mr allworthy‚Äôs danger (for the servant told him he was
dying) drove all thoughts of love out of his head. he hurried
instantly into the chariot which was sent for him, and ordered the
coachman to drive with all imaginable haste; nor did the idea of
sophia, i believe, once occur to him on the way.

and now the whole family, namely, mr blifil, mr jones, mr thwackum, mr
square, and some of the servants (for such were mr allworthy‚Äôs orders)
being all assembled round his bed, the good man sat up in it, and was
beginning to speak, when blifil fell to blubbering, and began to
express very loud and bitter lamentations. upon this mr allworthy
shook him by the hand, and said, ‚Äúdo not sorrow thus, my dear nephew,
at the most ordinary of all human occurrences. when misfortunes befal
our friends we are justly grieved; for those are accidents which might
often ha

ords choaked him, and he turned away to hide a tear which was
starting from his eyes.

allworthy then gently squeezed his hand, and proceeded thus: ‚Äúi am
convinced, my child, that you have much goodness, generosity, and
honour, in your temper: if you will add prudence and religion to
these, you must be happy; for the three former qualities, i admit,
make you worthy of happiness, but they are the latter only which will
put you in possession of it.

‚Äúone thousand pound i have given to you, mr thwackum; a sum i am
convinced which greatly exceeds your desires, as well as your wants.
however, you will receive it as a memorial of my friendship; and
whatever superfluities may redound to you, that piety which you so
rigidly maintain will instruct you how to dispose of them.

‚Äúa like sum, mr square, i have bequeathed to you. this, i hope, will
enable you to pursue your profession with better success than
hitherto. i have often observed with concern, that distress is more
apt to excite contempt th

he came hither first. marry come up with such gentlemen! though he

servant in the house ever saw the colour of his money. the devil shall
wait upon such a gentleman for me.‚Äù much more of the like kind she
muttered to herself; but this taste shall suffice to the reader.

neither thwackum nor square were much better satisfied with their
legacies. though they breathed not their resentment so loud, yet from
the discontent which appeared in their countenances, as well as from
the following dialogue, we collect that no great pleasure reigned in
their minds.

about an hour after they had left the sick-room, square met thwackum
in the hall and accosted him thus: ‚Äúwell, sir, have you heard any news
of your friend since we parted from him?‚Äù--‚Äúif you mean mr allworthy,‚Äù
 answered

 thwackum, ‚Äúi think you might rather give him the appellation
of your friend; for he seems to me to have deserved that title.‚Äù--‚Äúthe
title is as good on your side,‚Äù replied square, ‚Äúfor his bounty, such
as it is, hath been equal to both.‚Äù--‚Äúi should not have mentioned it
first,‚Äù cries thwackum, ‚Äúbut since you begin, i must inform you i am
of a different opinion. there is a wide distinction between voluntary
favours and rewards. the duty i have done in his family, and the care
i have taken in the education of his two boys, are services for which
some men might have expected a greater return. i would not have you
imagine i am therefore dissatisfied; for st paul hath taught me to
be content with the little i have. had the modicum been less, i

which you have been so long endeavouring to infuse into him, in
contempt of everything which is great and noble. the beauty and
loveliness of friendship is too strong for dim eyes, nor can it be
perceived by any other medium than that unerring rule of right, which
you have so often endeavoured to ridicule, that you have perverted
your friend‚Äôs understanding.‚Äù--‚Äúi wish,‚Äù cries thwackum, in a rage, ‚Äúi
wish, for the sake of his soul, your damnable doctrines have not
perverted his faith. it is to this i impute his present behaviour, so
unbecoming a christian. who but an atheist could think of leaving the
world without having first made up his account? without confessing his
sins, and receiving that absolution which he knew he had one in the
house duly authorized to give him? he will feel the want of these
necessaries when it is too late, when he is arrived at that place
where

there is wailing and gnashing of teeth. it is then he will find
in what mighty stead that heathen goddess, that virtue, which you and
all other deists of the age adore, will stand him. he will then summon
his priest, when there is none to be found, and will lament the want
of that absolution, without which no sinner can be safe.‚Äù--‚Äúif it be
so material,‚Äù says square, ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you present it him of your own
accord?‚Äù ‚Äúit hath no virtue,‚Äù cries thwackum, ‚Äúbut to those who have
sufficient grace to require it. but why do i talk thus to a heathen
and an unbeliever? it is you that taught him this lesson, for which
you have been well rewarded in this world, as i doubt not your
disciple will soon be in the other.‚Äù--‚Äúi know not what you mean by
reward,‚Äù said square; ‚Äúbut if you hint at that pitiful memorial of our
friendship, which he hath thought fit to bequeath me, i despise it;
and nothing but the unfortunate situation of my circumstance

the physician now arrived, and began to inquire of the two disputants,
how we all did above-stairs? ‚Äúin a miserable way,‚Äù answered thwackum.
‚Äúit is no more than i expected,‚Äù cries the doctor: ‚Äúbut pray what
symptoms have appeared since i left you?‚Äù--‚Äúno good ones, i am
afraid,‚Äù replied thwackum: ‚Äúafter what past at our departure, i think
there were little hopes.‚Äù the bodily physician, perhaps, misunderstood
the curer of souls; and before they came to an explanation, mr blifil
came to them with a most melancholy countenance, and acquainted them
that he brought sad news, that his mother was dead at salisbury; that
she had been seized on the road home with the gout in her head and
stomach, which had carried her off in a few hours. ‚Äúgood-lack-a-day!‚Äù
 says the doctor. ‚Äúone canno

difficult to treat; yet i have been remarkably successful in it.‚Äù
 thwackum and square both condoled with mr blifil for the loss of his
mother, which the one advised him to bear like a man, and the other
like a christian. the young gentleman said he knew very well we were
all mortal, and he would endeavour to submit to his loss as well as he
could. that he could not, however, help complaining a little against
the peculiar severity of his fate, which brought the news of so great
a calamity to him by surprize, and that at a time when he hourly
expected the severest blow

he was capable of feeling from the malice
of fortune. he said, the present occasion would put to the test those
excellent rudiments which he had learnt from mr thwackum and mr
square; and it would be entirely owing to them, if he was enabled to
survive such misfortunes.

it was now debated whether mr allworthy should be informed of the
death of his sister. this the doctor violently opposed; in which, i
believe, the whole college would agree with him: but mr blifil said,
he had received such positive and repeated orders from his uncle,
never to keep any secret from him for fear of the disquietude which it
might give him, that he durst not think of disobedience,

sed the doctor, and embraced him with the most
passionate endearments; swearing that next to mr allworthy himself, he
loved him of all men living. ‚Äúdoctor,‚Äù added he, ‚Äúyou deserve a statue
to be erected to you at the public expense, for having preserved a
man, who is not only the darling of all good men who know him, but a
blessing to society, the glory of his country, and an honour to human
nature. d--n me if i don‚Äôt love him better than my own soul.‚Äù

‚Äúmore shame for you,‚Äù cries thwackum. ‚Äúthough i think you have reason
to love him, for he hath provided very well for you. and perhaps it
might have been better for some folks that he had not lived to see
just reason of revoking his gift.‚Äù

jones now looking on thwackum with inconceivable disdain, answered,
‚Äúand doth thy mean soul imagine that any such considerations could
weigh with me? no, let the earth open and swallow her own dirt (if i
had millions of acres i would say it) rather than swallow up my dear
glorious friend.

the doctor now interposed, and prevented the effects of a wrath which
was kindling between jones and thwackum; after which the former gave a
loose to mirth, sang two or three amorous songs, and fell into every
frantic disorder which unbridled joy is apt to inspire; but so far was
he from any disposition to quarrel, that he was ten times better
humoured, if possible, than when he was sober.

him very indecent at this season; ‚Äúwhen,‚Äù as he said, ‚Äúthe house was a
house of mourning, on the account of his dear mother; and if it had
pleased heaven to give him some prospect of mr allworthy‚Äôs recovery,
it would become them better to express the exultations of their hearts
in thanksgiving, than in drunkenness and riots; which were properer
methods to encrease the divine wrath, than to avert it.‚Äù thwackum, who
had swallowed more liquor than jones, but without any ill effect on
his brain, seconded the pious harangue of blifil; but square, for
reasons which the reader may probably guess, was totally silent.

wine had not so totally overpowered jones, as to prevent his
recollecting mr blifil‚Äôs loss, the moment it was mentioned. as no
person, therefore, was more ready to confess and condemn his own
errors, he offered to shake mr blifil by the hand, and begged his
pardon, saying, ‚Äúhis excessive j

jones, who, notwithstanding his good humour, had some mixture of the
irascible in his constitution, leaped hastily from his chair, and
catching hold of blifil‚Äôs collar, cried out, ‚Äúd--n you for a rascal,
do you insult me with the misfortune of my birth?‚Äù he accompanied
these words with such rough actions, that they soon got the better of
mr blifil‚Äôs peaceful temper; and a scuffle immediately ensued, which
might have produced mischief, had it not been prevented by the
interposition of thwackum and the physician; for the philosophy of
square rendered him superior to all emotions, and he very calmly
smoaked his pipe, as was his custom in all broils, unless when he
apprehended some danger of having it broke in his mouth.

the combatants being now prevented from executing present vengeance on
each other, betook themselves to the common resources of disappointed
rage, and vented their wrath in threats and defiance. in this kind of
conflict, fortune, which, in the personal attack, seemed t

the parson and the young squire, who were taking a serious walk,
arrived at the stile which leads into the grove, and the latter caught
a view of the lovers just as they were sinking out of sight.

blifil knew jones very well, though he was at above a hundred yards‚Äô
distance, and he was as positive to the sex of his companion, though
not to the individual person. he started, blessed himself, and uttered
a very solemn ejaculation.

thwackum expressed some surprize at these sudden emotions, and asked
the reason of them. to which blifil answered, ‚Äúhe was certain he had
seen a fellow and wench retire together among the bushes, which he
doubted not was with some wicked purpose.‚Äù as to the name of jones, he
thought proper to conceal it, and why he did so must be left to the
judgment of the sagacious reader; for we never chuse to assign motives
to the actions of men, when there is any possibility of our being
mistaken.

game was so beset with briars, that it greatly obstructed their walk,
and caused besides such a rustling, that jones had sufficient warning
of their arrival before they could surprize him; nay, indeed, so
incapable was thwackum of concealing his indignation, and such
vengeance did he mutter forth every step he took, that this alone must
have abundantly satisfied jones that he was (to use the language of
sportsmen) found sitting.

the frighted hind, fierce and tremendous rushes forth the stag to the
entrance of the thicket; there stands he centinel over his love,
stamps the ground with his foot, and with his horns brandished aloft

thus, and more terrible, when he perceived the enemy‚Äôs approach,
leaped forth our heroe. many a step advanced he forwards, in order to
conceal the trembling hind, and, if possible, to secure her retreat.
and now thwackum, having first darted some livid lightning from his
fiery eyes, began to thunder forth, ‚Äúfie upon it! fie upon it! mr
jones. is it possible you should be the person?‚Äù--‚Äúyou see,‚Äù answered
jones, ‚Äúit is possible i should be here.‚Äù--‚Äúand who,‚Äù said thwackum,

as, indeed, all other relations are; for they all derive their
original from heaven. i would have you think yourself, therefore, as
much obliged to obey me now, as when i taught you your first
rudiments.‚Äù--‚Äúi believe you would,‚Äù cries jones; ‚Äúbut that will not
happen, unless you had the same birchen argument to convince
me.‚Äù--‚Äúthen i must tell you plainly,‚Äù said thwackum, ‚Äúi am resolved to
discover the wicked wretch.‚Äù--‚Äúand i must tell you plainly,‚Äù returned
jones, ‚Äúi am resolved you shall not.‚Äù thwackum then offered to
advance, and jones laid hold of his arms; which mr blifil endeavoured
to rescue, declaring, ‚Äúhe would not see his old master insulted.‚Äù

jones now finding himself engaged with two, thought it necessary to
rid himself of one of his antagonists as soon as possible. he
therefore applied to the weakest first; and, letting the parson

go, he
directed a blow at the young squire‚Äôs breast, which luckily taking
place, reduced him to measure his length on the ground.

thwackum was so intent on the discovery, that, the moment he found
himself at liberty, he stept forward directly into the fern, without
any great consideration of what might in the meantime befal his
friend; but he had advanced a very few paces into the thicket, before
jones, having defeated blifil, overtook the parson, and dragged him
backward by the skirt of his coat.

this parson had been a champion in his youth, and had won much honour
by his fist, both at school and at the university. he had now in

 with the blow. this he presently
returned with no less violence, aiming likewise at the parson‚Äôs
breast; but he dexterously drove down the fist of jones, so that it
reached only his belly, where two pounds of beef and as many of
pudding were then deposited, and whence consequently no hollow sound
could proceed. many lusty blows, much more pleasant as well as easy to
have seen, than to read or describe, were given on both sides: at last
a violent fall, in which jones had thrown his knees into thwackum‚Äôs
breast, so weakened the latter, that victory had been no longer
dubious, had not blifil, who had now recovered his strength, again
renewed the fight, and by engaging with jones, given the parson a
moment‚Äôs time to shake his ears, and to regain his breath.

and now both together attacked our heroe, whose blows did not retain
that force with which they had fallen at first, so weakened was he by
his combat with thwackum; for though the pedagogue chose rather to
play _solos_ on the human inst

to modern custom, was like to be decided by
numbers, when, on a sudden, a fourth pair of fists appeared in the
battle, and immediately paid their compliments to the parson; and the
owner of them at the same time crying out, ‚Äúare not you ashamed, and
be d--n‚Äôd to you, to fall two of you upon one?‚Äù

the battle, which was of the kind that for distinction‚Äôs sake is
called royal, now raged with the utmost violence during a few minutes;
till blifil being a second time laid sprawling by jones, thwackum
condescended to apply for quarter to his new antagonist, who was now
found to be mr western himself; for in the heat of the action none of
the combatants had recognized him.

in fact, that honest squire, happening, in his afternoon‚Äôs walk with
some company, to pass through the field where the bloody battle was
fought, and having concluded, from seeing three men engaged, that two
of them must be on a side, he hastened from his companions, and with
more gallantry than policy, espoused the cause

 of the weaker party. by
which generous proceeding he very probably prevented mr jones from
becoming a victim to the wrath of thwackum, and to the pious
friendship which blifil bore his old master; for, besides the
disadvantage of such odds, jones had not yet sufficiently recovered
the former strength of his broken arm. this reinforcement, however,
soon put an end to the action, and jones with his ally obtained the
victory.

nstant when the action was over. these were the honest clergyman,
whom we have formerly seen at mr western‚Äôs table; mrs western, the
aunt of sophia; and lastly, the lovely sophia herself.

at this time, the following was the aspect of the bloody field. in one
place lay on the ground, all pale, and almost breathless, the
vanquished blifil. near him stood the conqueror jones, almost covered
with blood, part of which was naturally his own, and part had been
lately the property of the reverend mr thwackum. in a third place
stood the said thwackum, like king porus, sullenly submitting to the
conqueror. the last figure in the piece was western the great, most
gloriously forbearing the vanquished foe.

blifil, in whom there was little sign of life, was at first the
principal object of the concern of every one, and particularly of mrs
western, who had drawn from her pocket a bottle of hartshorn, and was
herself about to apply it to his nostrils, when on a sudden the
attention of the whole company wa

ation.--‚Äúcome, my lad,‚Äù says western, ‚Äúd‚Äôoff thy
quoat and wash thy feace; for att in a devilish pickle, i promise
thee. come, come, wash thyself, and shat go huome with me; and we‚Äôl
zee to vind thee another quoat.‚Äù

jones immediately complied, threw off his coat, went down to the
water, and washed both his face and bosom; for the latter was as much
exposed and as bloody as the former. but though the water could clear
off the blood, it could not remove the black and blue marks which
thwackum had imprinted on both his face and breast, and which, being
discerned by sophia, drew from her a sigh and a look full of
inexpressible tenderness.

jones received this full in his eyes, and it had infinitely a stronger
effect on him than all the contusions which he had received before. an
effect, however, widely different; for so soft and balmy was it, that,
had all his former blows been stabs, it would for some minutes have
prevented his feeling their smart.

the company now moved backwards, a

got mr blifil again on his legs. here we cannot suppress a pious wish,
that all quarrels were to be decided by those weapons only with which
nature, knowing what is proper for us, hath supplied us; and that cold
iron was to be used in digging no bowels but those of the earth. then
would war, the pastime of monarchs, be almost inoffensive, and battles
between great armies might be fought at the particular desire of
several ladies of quality; who, together with the kings themselves,
might be

generosity of that people, i am persuaded they would never decline
putting themselves upon a par with their adversary; or, as the phrase
is, making themselves his match.

but such reformations are rather to be wished than hoped for: i shall
content myself, therefore, with this short hint, and return to my
narrative.

western began now to inquire into the original rise of this quarrel.
to which neither blifil nor jones gave any answer; but thwackum said
surlily, ‚Äúi believe the cause is not far off; if you beat the bushes
well you may find her.‚Äù--‚Äúfind her?‚Äù replied western: ‚Äúwhat! have you
been fighting for a wench?‚Äù--‚Äúask the gentleman in his waistcoat
there,‚Äù said thwackum: ‚Äúhe best knows.‚Äù ‚Äúnay then,‚Äù cries western, ‚Äúit
is a wench certainly.--ah, tom, tom, thou art a liquorish dog. but
come, gentlemen, be all friends, and go home with me, and make final
peace over a bottle.‚Äù ‚Äúi ask your pardon, sir,‚Äù say

s thwackum: ‚Äúit is
no such slight matter for a man of my character to be thus injuriously
treated, and buffeted by a boy, only because i would have done my
duty, in endeavouring to detect and bring to justice a wanton harlot;
but, indeed, the principal fault lies in mr allworthy and yourself;
for if you put the laws in execution, as you ought to do, you will
soon rid the country of these vermin.‚Äù

‚Äúi would as soon rid the country of foxes,‚Äù cries western. ‚Äúi think we

.‚Äù and indeed so he might; for he had now discovered the place
whence the poor girl had, at the beginning of the fray, stolen away,
upon as many feet as a hare generally uses in travelling.

sophia now desired her father to return home; saying she found herself
very faint, and apprehended a relapse. the squire immediately complied
with his daughter‚Äôs request (for he was the fondest of parents). he
earnestly endeavoured to prevail with the whole company to go and sup
with him: but blifil and thwackum absolutely refused; the former
saying, there were more reasons than he could then mention, why he
must decline this honour; and the latter declaring (perhaps rightly)
that it was not proper for a person of his function to be seen at any
place in his present condition.

jones was incapable of refusing the pleasure of being with his sophia;
so on he marched with squire western and his ladies, the parson
bringing up the rear. this had, indeed, offered to tarry with his
brother thwackum, professing

great civility, pushed him after mr western.

history.

and when i gave him a gentle hint of the indecency of his actions, he
fell into a violent passion, swore many oaths, called me rascal, and
struck me.‚Äù ‚Äúhow!‚Äù cries allworthy; ‚Äúdid he dare to strike you?‚Äù ‚Äúi am
sure,‚Äù cries blifil, ‚Äúi have forgiven him that long ago. i wish i
could so easily forget his ingratitude to the best of benefactors; and
yet even that i hope you will forgive him, since he must have
certainly been possessed with the devil: for that very evening, as mr
thwackum and myself were taking the air in the fields, and exulting in
the good symptoms which then first began to discover themselves, we
unluckily saw him engaged with a wench in a manner not fit to be
mentioned. mr thwackum, with more boldness than prudence, advanced to
rebuke him, when (i am sorry to say it) he fell upon the worthy man,
and beat him so outrageously that i wish he may have yet recovered the
bruises. nor was i without my share of the effects of his malice,
while i endeavoured to prote

ct my tutor; but that i have long
forgiven; nay, i prevailed with mr thwackum to forgive him too, and
not to inform you of a secret which i feared might be fatal to him.
and now, sir, since i have unadvisedly dropped a hint of this matter,
and your commands have obliged me to discover the whole, let me
intercede with you for him.‚Äù ‚Äúo child!‚Äù said allworthy, ‚Äúi know not
whether i should blame or applaud your goodness, in concealing such
villany a moment: but where is mr thwackum? not that i want any
confirmation of what you say; but i will examine all the evidence of
this matter, to justify to the world the example i am resolved to make
of such a monster.‚Äù

thwackum was now sent for, and presently appeared. he corroborated
every circumstance which the other had deposed; nay, he produced the
record upon his breast, where the handwriting of mr jones remained
very legible in black and blue. he concluded with declaring to mr
allworthy, that he should have long since info

ian about the house, who might have unravelled the real truth,
he should never be able to give it the malicious turn which he
intended. again, he resolved to hoard up this business, till the
indiscretion of jones should afford some additional complaints; for he
thought the joint weight of many facts falling upon him together,
would be the most likely to crush him; and he watched, therefore, some
such opportunity as that with which fortune had now kindly presented
him. lastly, by prevailing with thwackum to conceal the matter for a
time, he knew he should confirm an opinion of his friendship to jones,
which he had greatly laboured to establish in mr allworthy.

good-natured reader.


it was mr allworthy‚Äôs custom never to punish any one, not even to turn
away a servant, in a passion. he resolved therefore to delay passing
sentence on jones till the afternoon.

which was all to be settled on his daughter and her issue;
for so extravagant was the affection of that fond parent, that,
provided his child would but consent to be miserable with the husband
he chose, he cared not at what price he purchased him.

for these reasons mr blifil was so desirous of the match that he
intended to deceive sophia, by pretending love to her; and to deceive
her father and his own uncle, by pretending he was beloved by her. in
doing this he availed himself of the piety of thwackum, who held, that
if the end proposed was religious (as surely matrimony is), it
mattered not how wicked were the means. as to other occasions, he used
to apply the philosophy of square, which taught, that the end was
immaterial, so that the means were fair and consistent with moral
rectitude. to say truth, there were few occurrences in life on which
he could not draw advantage from the precepts of one or other of those
great masters.

little deceit was indeed necessary to be practised on mr west

ch entreaty, he said,
‚Äúsince you have heard, my friend, so much of my affairs, and seem so
desirous to know the truth, if you will have patience to hear it, i
will inform you of the whole.‚Äù--‚Äúpatience!‚Äù cries benjamin, ‚Äúthat i
will, if the chapter was never so long; and i am very much obliged to
you for the honour you do me.‚Äù

jones now began, and related the whole history, forgetting only a
circumstance or two, namely, everything which passed on that day in
which he had fought with thwackum; and ended with his resolution to go
to sea, till the rebellion in the north had made him change his
purpose, and had brought him to the place where he then was.

little benjamin, who had been all attention, never once interrupted
the narrative; but when it was ended he could not help observing, that
there must be surely something more invented by his enemies, and told
mr allworthy against him, or so good a man would never have dismissed
one he had loved so tenderly, in such a manner. to which

what that fate is very well,‚Äù cries dowling, with a most facetious
grin.--‚Äúwell,‚Äù continued the other, ‚Äúthe squire ordered him to be
taken in; for he is a timbersome man everybody knows, and was afraid
of drawing himself into a scrape; and there the bastard was bred up,
and fed, and cloathified all to the world like any gentleman; and
there he got one of the servant-maids with child, and persuaded her to
swear it to the squire himself; and afterwards he broke the arm of one
mr thwackum a clergyman, only because he reprimanded him for following
whores; and afterwards he snapt a pistol at mr blifil behind his back;
and once, when squire allworthy was sick, he got a drum, and beat it
all over the house to prevent him from sleeping; and twenty other
pranks he hath played, for all which, about four or five days ago,
just before i left the country, the squire stripped him stark naked,
and turned him out of doors.‚Äù

of his daughter‚Äôs consent: ‚Äúbut he was
(says she) always of a violent, headstrong temper; and i can scarce
forgive myself for all the advice i have thrown away upon him.‚Äù

after much of this kind of conversation, which, perhaps, would not
greatly entertain the reader, was it here particularly related, mr
blifil took his leave and returned home, not highly pleased with his
disappointment: which, however, the philosophy which he had acquired
from square, and the religion infused into him by thwackum, together
with somewhat else, taught him to bear rather better than more
passionate lovers bear these kinds of evils.

it is now time to look after sophia; whom the reader, if he loves her
half so well as i do, will rejoice to find escaped from the clutches
of her passionate father, and from those of her dispassionate lover.

noble intrepidity, and a certain superior contempt of reputation, from
the frail ones of meaner degree, as a virtuous woman of quality is by
the elegance and delicacy of her sentiments from the honest wife of a
yeoman and shopkeeper. lady bellaston was of this intrepid character;
but let not my country readers conclude from her, that this is the
general conduct of women of fashion, or that we mean to represent them
as such. they might as well suppose that every clergyman was
represented by thwackum, or every soldier by ensign northerton.

there is not, indeed, a greater error than that which universally
prevails among the vulgar, who, borrowing their opinion from some
ignorant satirists, have affixed the character of lewdness to these
times. on the contrary, i am convinced there never was less of love
intrigue carried on among persons of condition than now. our present
women have been taught by their mothers to fix their thoughts only on
ambition and vanity, and to despise the pleasures o

d, that he should ever think of prevailing by any other
than the most gentle methods! ‚Äúbesides, sir,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúif they fail,
you may then (which will be surely time enough) deny your consent.‚Äù he
urged the great and eager desire which mr western had for the match;
and lastly, he made great use of the name of jones, to whom he imputed
all that had happened; and from whom, he said, to preserve so valuable
a young lady was even an act of charity.

all these arguments were well seconded by thwackum, who dwelt a little
stronger on the authority of parents than mr blifil himself had done.
he ascribed the measures which mr blifil was desirous to take to
christian motives; ‚Äúand though,‚Äù says he, ‚Äúthe good young gentleman
hath mentioned charity last, i am almost convinced it is his first and
principal consideration.‚Äù

tune, though in a different key, and would have discovered much moral

of the present situation of mr jones‚Äôs mind, and of the pangs with
which he was now tormented, we cannot give the reader a better idea
than by saying, his misery was such that even thwackum would almost
have pitied him. but, bad as it is, we shall at present leave him in
it, as his good genius (if he really had any) seems to have done. and
here we put an end to the sixteenth book of our history.

mr square. to which she answered, with much sweetness, `you will
pardon me, good mr allworthy; i am sure you cannot in earnest think me
capable of deciding any point in which two such gentlemen disagree.‚Äô
thwackum and square, who both alike thought themselves sure of a
favourable decision, seconded my request. she answered with the same
good humour, `i must absolutely be excused: for i will affront neither
so much as to give my judgment on his side.‚Äô indeed, she always shewed

the reader will, after this, scarce wonder at the revolution so
visibly appearing in mr allworthy, notwithstanding he received from
thwackum, by the same post, another letter of a very different kind,
which we shall here add, as it may possibly be the last time we shall
have occasion to mention the name of that gentleman.

  ‚Äúsir,

  ‚Äúi am not at all surprized at hearing from your worthy nephew a

this was the first time thwackum ever wrote in this authoritative
stile to allworthy, and of this he had afterwards sufficient reason to
repent, as in the case of those who mistake the highest degree of
goodness for the lowest degree of weakness. allworthy had indeed never
liked this man. he knew him to be proud and ill-natured; he also knew
that his divinity itself was tinctured with his temper, and such as in
many respects he himself did by no means approve; but he was at the
same time a

unimpeached honesty, and a most devout attachment to religion. so
that, upon the whole, though allworthy did not esteem nor love the
man, yet he could never bring himself to part with a tutor to the
boys, who was, both by learning and industry, extremely well qualified
for his office; and he hoped, that as they were bred up in his own
house, and under his own eye, he should be able to correct whatever
was wrong in thwackum‚Äôs instructions.



chapter v.

in which the history is continued.


mr allworthy, in his last speech, had recollected some tender ideas
concerning jones, which had brought tears into the good man‚Äôs eyes.
this mrs miller observing, said, ‚Äúyes, yes, sir, your goodness to this
poor young man is known, notwithstanding all your care to conceal it;
but there is not a single syllable of truth in what those villains
said. mr nightingale hath now discovered the whole matter. it seems

as a conquered rebellion strengthens a government, or as health is
more perfectly established by recovery from some diseases; so anger,
when removed, often gives new life to affection. this was the case of
mr allworthy; for blifil having wiped off the greater suspicion, the
lesser, which had been raised by square‚Äôs letter, sunk of course, and
was forgotten; and thwackum, with whom he was greatly offended, bore
alone all the reflections which square had cast on the enemies of
jones.

as for that young man, the resentment of mr allworthy began more and
more to abate towards him. he told blifil, ‚Äúhe did not only forgive
the extraordinary efforts of his good-nature, but would give him the
pleasure of following his example.‚Äù then, turning to mrs miller with a
smile which would have become an angel, he cryed, ‚Äúwhat say you,

miles distant from london, and lays up ¬£200 a-year out of it, in order
to purchase a seat in the next parliament from a neighbouring borough,
which he has bargained for with an attourney there. he is also lately
turned methodist, in hopes of marrying a very rich widow of that sect,
whose estate lies in that part of the kingdom.

square died soon after he writ the before-mentioned letter; and as to
thwackum, he continues at his vicarage. he hath made many fruitless
attempts to regain the confidence of allworthy, or to ingratiate
himself with jones, both of whom he flatters to their faces, and
abuses behind their backs. but in his stead, mr allworthy hath lately
taken mr abraham adams into his house, of whom sophia is grown
immoderately fond, and declares he shall have the tuition of her
children.
