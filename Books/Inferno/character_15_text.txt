  where the hypocrites walk at a snail's pace, weighed down
  by gilded cloaks of lead--the merry friars catalano and

  canto xxvi.

  the eighth circle--eighth bolgia, where are the evil counsellors,

    he suffered from, and stares with sighs profound:

whites which distracted pistoia towards the close of the thirteenth
century.
