        the heavenly father had been most merciful to me in leading me to this place. mrs. bruce was a kind and gentle lady, and proved a true and sympathizing friend. before the stipulated month expired, the necessity of

passing up and down stairs frequently, caused my limbs to swell so painfully, that i became unable to perform my duties. many ladies would have thoughtlessly discharged me; but mrs. bruce made arrangements to save me steps, and employed a physician to attend upon me. i had not yet told her that i was a fugitive slave. she noticed that i was often sad, and kindly

y children, and from relatives who were dear to me; but i did not mention the constant feeling of insecurity which oppressed my spirits. i longed for some one to confide in; but i had been so deceived by white people, that i had lost all confidence in them. if they spoke kind words to me, i thought it was for some selfish purpose. i had entered this family with the distrustful feelings i had brought with me out of slavery; but ere six months had passed, i found that the gentle deportment of mrs. bruce and the smiles of her lovely babe were thawing my chilled heart. my narrow mind also began to expand under the influences of her intelligent conversation, and the opportunities for reading, which were gladly allowed me whenever i had leisure from my duties. i gradually became more energetic and more cheerful.

        the old feeling of insecurity, especially with regard to my children, often threw its dark shadow across my sunshine. mrs. bruce offered me a home for ellen; but pleasant as it wo

ars of my earnings were expended to keep my child comfortably clothed. that, however, was a slight trouble, compared with the fear that their pecuniary embarrassments might induce them to sell my precious young daughter. i knew they were in constant communication with southerners, and had frequent opportunities to do it. i have stated that when dr. flint put ellen in jail, at two years old, she had an inflammation of the eyes, occasioned by measles. this disease still troubled her; and kind mrs. bruce proposed that she should come to new york for a while, to be under the care of dr. elliott, a well known oculist. it did not occur to me that there was any thing improper in a mother's making such a request; but mrs. hobbs was very angry, and refused to let her go. situated as i was, it was not politic to insist upon it. i made no complaint, but i longed to be entirely free to act a mother's part towards my children. the next time i went over to brooklyn, mrs. hobbs, as if to apologize for her

cause she did not consider it safe to trust her in new york. i accepted the explanation in silence; but she had told me that my child belonged to her daughter, and i suspected

page 257
that her real motive was a fear of my conveying her property away from her. perhaps i did her injustice; but my knowledge of southerners made it difficult for me to feel otherwise.

        sweet and bitter were mixed in the cup of my life, and i was thankful that it had ceased to be entirely bitter. i loved mrs. bruce's babe. when it laughed and crowed in my face, and twined its little tender arms confidingly about my neck, it made me think of the time when benny and ellen were babies, and my wounded heart was soothed. one bright morning, as i stood at the window, tossing baby in my arms, my attention was attracted by a young man in sailor's dress, who was closely observing every house as he passed. i looked at him earnestly. could it be my brother william? it must be he—and yet, how changed! i placed the

pose i was goose enough to go into such a trap? verily, he relied too much on "the stupidity of the african race." i did not return the family of flints any thanks for their cordial invitation—a remissness for which i was, no doubt, charged with base ingratitude.

        not long afterwards i received a letter from one of my friends at the south, informing me that dr. flint was about to visit the north. the letter had been delayed, and i supposed he might be already on the

way. mrs. bruce did not know i was a fugitive. i told her that important business called me to boston, where my brother then was, and asked permission to bring a friend to supply my place as nurse, for a fortnight. i started on my journey immediately; and as soon as i arrived, i wrote to my grandmother that if benny came, he must be sent to boston. i knew she was only waiting for a good chance to send him north, and, fortunately, she had the legal power to do so, without asking leave of any body. she was a fre

        dr. flint made his visit to new york, and made every exertion to call upon me, and invite me to return with him; but not being able to ascertain where i was, his hospitable intentions were frustrated, and the affectionate family, who were waiting for me with "open arms," were doomed to disappointment.

        as soon as i knew he was safely at home, i placed benjamin in the care of my brother william, and returned to mrs. bruce. there i remained through the winter and spring, endeavoring to perform my duties faithfully, and finding a good degree of happiness in the attractions of baby mary, the considerate kindness of her excellent mother, and occasional interviews with my darling daughter.

        but when summer came, the old feeling of insecurity haunted me. it was necessary for me to take little mary out daily, for exercise and fresh air, and

        it was a relief to my mind to see preparations for leaving the city. we went to albany in the steamboat knickerbocker. when the gong sounded for tea, mrs. bruce said, "linda, it is late, and you and baby had better come to the table with me." i replied, "i know it is time baby had her supper, but i had rather not go with you, if you please. i am afraid of being insulted." "o no, not if you are with me," she said. i saw several white nurses go with their ladies, and i ventured to do the same. we were at the extreme end of the table. i was no sooner seated, than a gruff voice said, "get up! you know you are not allowed to sit here." i looked up, and, to

my astonishment and indignation, saw that the speaker was a colored man. if his office required him to enforce the by-laws of the boat, he might, at least, have done it politely. i replied, "i shall not get up, unless the captain comes and takes me up." no cup of tea was offered me, but mrs. bruce handed me hers and called for another. i looked to see whether the other nurses were treated in a similar manner. they were all properly waited on.
        next morning, when we stopped at troy for breakfast, every body was making a rush for the table. mrs. bruce said, "take my arm, linda, and we'll go in together." the landlord heard her, and said, "madam, will you allow your nurse and baby to take

        at saratoga we found the united states hotel crowded, and mr. bruce took one of the cottages belonging to the hotel. i had thought, with gladness, of going to the quiet of the country, where i should meet few people, but here i found myself in the midst of a swarm of southerners. i looked round me with fear and trembling, dreading to see some one who would recognize me. i was rejoiced to find that we were to stay but a short time.

        we soon returned to new york, to make arrangements for spending the remainder of the summer at rockaway. while the laundres

        being in servitude to the anglo-saxon race, i was not put into a "jim crow car," on our way to rockaway, neither was i invited to ride through the streets on the top of trunks in a truck; but every where i found the same manifestations of that cruel prejudice, which so discourages the feelings, and represses the energies of the colored people. we reached rockaway before dark, and put up at the pavilion—a large hotel, beautifull

        this was the climax! i found it hard to preserve my self-control, when i looked round, and saw women who were nurses, as i was, and only one shade lighter in complexion, eyeing me with a defiant look, as if my presence were a contamination. however, i said nothing. i quietly took the child in my arms, went to our room, and refused to go to the table again. mr. bruce ordered meals to be sent to the room for little mary and i. this answered for a few days; but the waiters of the establishment were white, and they soon began to complain, saying they were not hired to wait on negroes. the landlord requested mr. bruce to send me down to my meals, because his servants rebelled against bringing them up, and the colored servants of other boarders were dissatisfied because all were not treated alike.

        in the spring, sad news came to me. mrs. bruce was dead. never again, in this world, should i see her gentle face, or hear her sympathizing voice. i had lost an excellent friend, and little mary had lost a tender mother. mr. bruce wished the child to visit some of her mother's relatives in england, and he was desirous that i should take charge of her. the little motherless one was accustomed to me, and attached to me, and i thought she would be happier in my care than in that of a stranger. i could also earn more in this way than i could by

        it was lucky for me that the evening paper was not burned up before i had a chance to examine the list of arrivals. it was not long after mrs. bruce's return to her house, before several people came to inquire for me. one inquired for me, another asked for my daughter ellen, and another said he had a letter from my grandmother, which he was requested to deliver in person.
