ople, which is no
news, the greatest news was the robbery at the house of
hwang.'

it was just what wang lung hoped to hear, and the
man went on to tell him of it with relish, describing how
the few slaves left had screamed and how they had been
carried off and how the concubines that remained had
been raped and driven out and some even taken away, so
that now none cared to live in that house at all. 'none/
the man finished, 'except the old lord, who is now wholly
the creature of a slave called cuckoo, who has for many
years been in the old lord's chamber, while others came
and went, because of her cleverness.'

'and has this woman command, then?' asked wang
lung, listening closely,

'for the time she can do anything,' replied the man.
'and so for the time she closes her hand on everything
that can be held and swallows all that can be swallowed.
some day, of course, when the young lords have their
affairs settled in other parts they will come back and then,
she cannot fool them with her talk

o the streets, especially after
midnight, although where wang lung sat the clatter and
noise of many men drinking tea and the sharp bony click
of dice and sparrow dominoes muffled all else.

thus it was that wang lung did not hear behind him
on this night the footsteps of a woman creaking upon the
narrow stair, and so, not expecting that any would know
him here, he started violently when one touched him on
the shoulder. when he looked up it was into a narrow,
handsome, woman's face, the face of cuckoo, the woman
into whose hands he had poured the jewels that day he

142



bought land, and whose hand had held steady the old
lord's shaking one and helped him to set aright his seal
upon the de^ed of the sale. she laughed when she saw him,
and her laughter was a sort of sharp whispering.



'well, (and wang the farmer!' she said, lingering with
malice o§ the word farmer, 'and who would think to see



it seemed to wang lung then that he must prove at
any cost to this woman that he was more tha

n a mere
country fellow, and he laughed and said too loudly:

'is not my money as good to spend as another man's?
and money i do not lack in these days. i have had good
fortune.'

cuckoo stopped at this, her eyes narrow and bright as
a snake's eyes, and her voice smooth as oil flowing from a
vessel.

'and who has not heard it? and how shall a man
better spend the money he has over and above his living
than in a place like this, where rich men take their joy
and elegant lords gather to take their joy in feasting and
pleasure? there is no such wine as ours — have you tasted
it, wang lung?'

'i have only drunk tea as yet,' replied wang lung, and
he was half ashamed. 'i have not

 said in confusion :

'no — no — i have not — only tea '

then the woman laughed again and pointed to the
painted silken scrolls and said:

'there they are, their pictures. choose which one you

wish to see and put the silver in my hand and i will place
her before you.'

'those!' said wang lung, wondering. 'i thought they
were pictures of dream women, of goddesses in the moun-
tain of kwen lwen, such as the storytellers speak of!'

'so they are dream women/ rejoined cuckoo, with
mocking good humour, 'but dreams such as a little silver
will turn into flesh.' and she went on her way, nodding
and winking at the servants standing about and motioning
to wang lung as at one of whom she said, 'there is a
country bumpkin!'

but wang lung sat staring at the pictures with a new
interest. up this narrow stairway then, in the rooms above
him, there were these women in flesh and blood, and men
went up to them — other men than he, of course, but men !

wang lung hesitated upon the threshold and he stood
in the bright light which streamed from the open doors.
and he might have stood there and gone away, for he was
fearful and timid in his heart still, although his blood was
rushing through his body fit to burst his veins, but there
came out of the shadows on the edge of the light a woman
who had been leaning idly against the doorway and it was
cuckoo. she came forward when she saw a man's figure,
for it was her business to get custom for the women of the
house, but when she saw who it was, she shrugged her
shoulders and said:

'at, it is only the farmer!'

wang was stung with the sharp carelessness in her
voice, and his sudden anger gave him a courage he had
not otherwise, so that he said:

'well, and may i not come into the house and may i
not do as other men?'

and she shrugged herself again and laughed and
said :

st time he had ever climbed steps in a
house. nevertheless, when they reached the top, it was the
same as a house on the earth, except that it seemed a
mighty way up when he passed a window and looked into
the sky. the woman led the way down a close dark hall,
then, and she cried as she went:

'now here is the first of the night!'

all along the hall doors opened suddenly and here and
there girls' heads showed themselves in patches of light, as
flowers burst out of their sheaths in the sun, but cuckoo
called cruelly:

'no, not you— and not you — no one has asked for any i
of you! this one is for the little pink-faced dwarf from i
soochow — for lotus!'

a ripple of sound ran down the hall, indistinct, derisive,
and one girl, ruddy as a pomegranate, called out in a big
voice :

'and lotus may have this fellow — he smells of the
fields and of garlic!'

this wang lung heard, although he disdained to an-
swer, although her words smote him like a daggerthrust
because he feared that he look

n that she lived. he was impatient,
therefore, when his uncle's wife asked further:

'and where her home?'

'now where,' he answered with asperity, 'where except
in the great tea-shop on the main street of the town?'

'the one called the house of flowers?'

'and what other?' wang lung retorted.

she mused awhile, fingering her pursed lower lip, and
she said at last:



157



'i do not know any one there. i shall have to find a
way. who is the keeper of this woman?'

and when he told her it was cuckoo, who had been
slave in the great house, she laughed and said:

'oh, that one? is that what she did after the old lord
died in her bed one night! well, and it is what she would
do/

then she laughed again, a crackling 'heh — heh —
heh ' and she said easily:

'that one! but it is a simple matter, indeed. everything
is plain. that one ! from the beginning that one would do
anything, even to making a mountain if she could feel silver
enough in her palm for it.'

and wang lung, hearing this, fel

 of my land!'

then from a strange and contrary fever of love wang
lung would not go again to the great tea-house until the
affair was arranged. to himself he said:

'and if she will not come to my house and be for me
only, cut my throat and i will not go near her again.'

but when he thought the words, "if she will not come",
his heart stood still with fear, so that he continually ran to
his uncle's wife saying :

'now, lack of money shall not close the gate.' and
he said again, 'have you told cuckoo that i have silver
and gold for my will?' and he said, 'tell her she shall do
no work of any kind in my house but she shall wear only
silken garments and eat shark's fins if she will every day,'
until at last the fat woman grew impatient and cried out at
him, rolling her eyes back and forth:

'enough and enough! am i a fool, or is this the first
time i have managed a man and a maid? leave me alone
and i will do it. i have said everything many times.'

then there was nothing to do except to gnaw

dried shark's fins and every delicacy he knew he
bought and then he waited — if that burning, restless im-
patience within him could be called a waiting.

on a shining, glittering, fiery day in the eighth moon,
which is the end of summer, she came to his house. from
afar wang lung saw her coming. she rode in a closed
sedan chair of bamboo borne upon men's shoulders and he
watched the sedan moving this way and that upon the
narrow paths skirting the fields, and behind it followed the
figure of cuckoo. then for an instant he knew fear and
he said to himself:

'what am i taking into my house?'

and scarcely knowing what he did he went quickly
into the room where he had slept for these many years
with his wife and he shut the door and there in the darkness
if the room he waited in confusion until he heard his
uncle's wife calling loudly for him to come out, for one[
was at the gate.

then abashed and as though he had never seen the girl
before he went slowly out, hanging his head over his fine

clothes, and his eyes looking here and there but never
ahead. but cuckoo hailed him merrily:

'well, and i did not know we would be doing business
like this!'

then she went to the chair which the men had set down
and she lifted the curtain and clucked her tongue and she
said:

'come out, my lotus flower, here is your house and *
here your lord.'

and wang lung was in an agony because he saw upon
the faces of the chairmen wide grins of laughter and he
thought to himself:

161

5056, 11.



'now these are loafers from the town streets and they
are worthless fellows,'
 
 ___________________________
 
was lifted and before he knew what
he did he looked and he saw sitting in the shadowy recess
of the chair, painted and cool as a lily, the girl lotus. he
forgot everything, even his anger against the grinning
fellows from the town, everything but that he had bought
this woman for his own and she had come to his house
for ever, sind he stood stiff and trembling, watching as
she rose, graceful as though a wind had passed over a
flower. then as he watched and could not take his eyes
away, she took cuckoo's hand and stepped out, keeping >
her head bowed and her eyelids dropped as she walked,
tottering and swaying upon her little feet, and leaning upon
cuckoo. and as she passed him she did not speak to him,
but she whispered only to cuckoo, faintly:

'where is my apartment?'

then his uncle's wife came forward to her other side j
and between them they led the girl into the court and into !
the new rooms that wang lung had built for her. and of
all wang lung's house there was none to see her pass,

 for j
he had sent the labourers and ching away for the day to j
work on a distant field, and o-lan had gone somewhere he
knew not and had taken the two little ones with her and
the boys were in school and the old man slept against the
wall and heard and saw nothing, and as for the poor fool, j
she saw no one who came and went and knew no face
except her father's and her mother's. but when lotus had
gone in cuckoo drew the curtains after her. j

then after a time wang lung's uncle's wife came out,
laughing a little maliciously, and she dusted her hands
together as though to free them of something that clung
to them.

'she reeks of perfume and paint, that one,' she said still
laughing, 'like a regular bad one she smells.' and then
she said with a deeper malice, 'she is not so young as she i \
looks, my nephew ! i will dare to say this, that if she had \
not been on the edge of an age when men will cease s

then she ate a little
with the children. then when they slept and wang lung
still sat at the table dreaming she washed herself for sleeping >
and at last she went into her accustomed room and slept
alone' upon her bed.

then did wang lung eat and drink of his love night
and day. day after day he went into the room where lotus
| lay indolent upon her bed and he sat beside her and watched
i her at all she did. she never came forth in the heat of the
early autumn days, but she- lay while the woman cuckoo
bathed her slender body with lukewarm water and rubbed
oil into her flesh and perfume and oil into her hair. for
lotus had said wilfully that cuckoo must stay with her
as her servant and she paid her prodigally so that the woman
was willing enough to serve one instead of a score, and she
and lotus, her mistress, dwelt apart from the others in the
new court that wang lung had made.

i6 3



all day the girl lay in the cool darkness of her room,
nibbling sweetmeats and fruits, and wearing nothing
 
 ___________________________
 
 but
single garments of green summer silk, a little tight coat cut
to her waist and wide trousers beneath, and thus wang
lung found her when he came to her and he ate and drank
of his love.

then at sunset she sent him away with her pretty petu-
lance, and cockoo bathed and perfumed her again and
put on her fresh clothes, soft white silk against her flesh
and peach-coloured silk outside, the silken garments that
wang lung had given, and upon her feet cuckoo put
small embroidered shoes, and then the girl walked into the
court and examined the little pool with its five goldfish,
and wang lung stood and stared at the wonder of what
he had. she swayed upon her little feet and to wang lung
there was nothing so wonderful for beauty in the world as
her pointed little feet and her curling helpless hands.

and he ate and drank of his love and he feasted alone,
and he was satisfied.

it was not to be supposed that the coming
of this one called lotus an

but wang lung had not foreseen it. and even though he
saw by o-lan's sullen looks and cuckoo's sharpness that
something was amiss, he would not pay heed to it and he
was careless of any one so long as he was still fierce with
his desire.

nevertheless, when day passed into night, and night,
changed into dawn, wang lung saw. that it was true the
sun rose in the morning, and this woman lotus was there,
and the moon rose in its season and she was there for his
hand to grasp when it would, and his thirst of love was
somewhat slaked and he saw things he had not seen before.*

for one thing,
 
 ___________________________
 
 he saw that there was trouble at once
between o-lan and cuckoo. this was an astonishment to



164



him, for he was\prepared for o-lan to hate lotus, having
heard many times of such things, and some women will
even hang themselves upon a beam with a rope when a
man takes a second woman into the house, and others will
scold and contrive to make his life worthless for what he ,
has done, and he was glad that o-lan was a silent woman, \
for at least she could not think of words against him. but
he had not foreseen that whereas she would be silent of
lotus, 
 
 ___________________________
 
her anger would find its vent against cuckoo.

now wang lung had thought only of lotus and when
she begged him:

'let me have this woman for my servant, seeing thaf^
i am altogether alone in the world, for my father and my
mother died when i could not yet walk and my uncle sold
me as soon as i was pretty to a life such as i have had,
and i have no one.'

this she said with her tears, always abundant and ready
and glittering in the corners of her pretty eyes, and wang
lung could have denied her nothing she asked when she
looked up at him s
 
 ___________________________
 
o. besides, it was true enough that the
girl had no one to serve her, and it was true she would be
alone in his house, for it was plain enough and to be
expected that o-lan would not serve the second one, and
she would not speak to her or notice that she was in the
house at all. there was only the uncle of lotus then, and
it was against wang lung's stomach to have that one
peeping and prying and near to lotus for her to talk to
of him, and so cuckoo was as good as any and he knew
no other woman who would come. — .

but it seemed that o-lan, when she saw t cuckoo, grew )
angry with a deep and sullen anger that wang lung had /
never seen and did not know was in her. cuckoo was
willing enough to be friends, since she had her pay from
wang lung, albeit she did not forget that in the great house
she had been in the lord's chamber and o-lan a kitchen slave
and one of many. nevertheless, she called out to o-lan
well enough when first she saw he
 
 ___________________________
 
 still
angry that he was ashamed and he said to himself and he
muttered the words aloud and restlessly, as though he
quarrelled with some one:

'well, and other men are so and i have been good
enough to her, and there are men worse than i.' and he
said at last that o-lan must bear it.

but o-lan was not finished with it, and she went her
way silently. in the morning she heated water and pre-
sented it to the old man, and to wang lung if he were
not in the inner court she presented tea, but when cuckoo
went to find hot water for her mistress the cauldron was
empty and not all her loud questionings would stir any.
response from o-lan. then there was nothing but that
cuckoo must herself boil water for her mistress if she would
have it. but then it was time to stir the morning gruel
and there was not space in the cauldron for more water
and o-lan would go steadily to her cooking, answering
nothing to cuckoo's loud crying:

c and is my delicate lady to lie thirsting and gasping in
her bed for a s
 
 ___________________________
 
wallow of water in the morning?'

but o-lan would not hear her; only she pushed more grass
and straw into the bowels of the oven, spreading it as
carefully and as thriftily as ever she had in the old days
when one leaf was precious enough because of the fire it
would make under food. then cuckoo went complaining
loudly to wang lung and he was angry that his love must
be marred by such things and he went to o-lan to reproach
her and he shouted at her:

'and cannot you add a dipperful of water to the cauldron
in the mornings?'

but she answered with a sullenness deeper than ever
upon her face:

167



' 'i am not slave of slaves in this house at least.'

r then he was angry beyond bearing and he seized o-lan's

shoulder and he shook her soundly and he said:

| 'do not be yet more of a fo
 
 ___________________________
 
ol. it is not for the servant

but for the mistress.'

and she bore his violence and she looked at him and
she said simply:

i 'and to that one you gave my two pearls!'
i then his hand dropped and he was speechless and his
^nger was gone and he. went away ashamed and he said
!to cuckoo:

f 'we will build another stove and i will make another
ikitchen. the first wife knows nothing of the delicacies
which the other one needs for her flower-like body and
which you also enjoy. you shall cook what you please
in it.'

and so he bade the labourers build a little room and
an earthen stove in it and he bought a good cauldron.
and cuckoo was pleased because he said, 'you shall cook
what you please in it.'

as for wang lung, he said to himself that at last his
affairs were settled and h

is women at peace and he could
enjoy his love. and it seemed to him freshly that he could
never tire of lotus and of the way she pouted at him with
the lids dropped like lily petals over her great eyes, and at
the way laughter gleamed out of her eyes when she glanced
up at him.

but after all this matter of the new kitchen became a
thorn in his body, for cuckoo went to the town every day
and she bought this and that of expensive foods , that are
imported from the southern cities. there were foods he had
never even heard of: lichee nuts and dried honey dates
and curious cakes of rice flour and nuts and red sugar,
and horned fish from the sea and many other things. and
these all cost money more than he liked to give out, but
still not so much, he was sure, as cuckoo told him, and
yet he was afraid to say, 'you are eating my flesh,' for
fear she would be

 daughter, his poor fool. now the four other
children were constantly curious about this lady who lived
in the inner court, but the two elder boys were conscious
and shy and knew well enough why she was there and what
their father had to do with her, although they never spoke
of her unless to each other secretly. but the two younger
ones could never be satisfied with their peepings and their
exclamations, and sniffing of the perfume she wore and
dipping their fingers into the bowls of food that cuckoo
carried away from her rooms after she had eaten.

lotus complained many times to wang lung that his
children were a plague to her and she wished there were a
way to lock them out so that she need not be plagued with
them. but this he was not willing to do, and he answered
her in jest:

'well, and they like to look at a lovely face as much
as their father does.'

and he did nothing except to forbid them to enter her
courts and when he saw them they did not, but when he
did not see them th

t he had been
cheated, but he always said courteously as might a prince
or might some from a learned and noble house, "well, and
here is the silver, and rest, my child, until love blooms
again." he spoke very prettily to us.' and lotus mused
until wang lung said hastily to waken her, for he did not
like her to think on her old life:

'what was his business, then, with all this silver?'

and she answered:

'now and i do not know but i think he was master of

181



a grain market, but i will ask cuckoo who knows every-
thing about men and their money.'

then she clapped her hands and cuckoo ran in from
the kitchen, her high cheeks and nose flushed with the fire,
and lotus asked her:

'who was that great, large, goodly man who came to
me and then to pomegranate flower, because i was like
his little daughter, so that it troubled him, though he ever
loved me best?'

and cuckoo answered at once, 'ah, and that was liu,
the grain dealer. ah, he was a good m?n! he left silver
in my palm whenever he 
 
 ___________________________
 
saw me.'

'where is his market?' asked wang lung, although idly,
because it was woman's talk and likely to come to nothing.

'in the street of the stone bridge,' said cuckoo.

then before she finished the words wang lung struck
his hands together in delight and he said:

'now then, that is where i sell my grain, and it is a
propitious thing and surely it can be done,' and for the
first time his interest was awake, because it seemed to him
a lucky thing to wed his son to the daughter of the man
who bought his grain.

w r hen there was a .thing to be done, cuckoo smelled
the money in it as a rat smells tallow, and she wiped her
hands upon her apron and she said quick

ly :

'i am ready to serve the master.'

wang lung was doubtful, and doubting, he looked at
her crafty face, but lotus said gaily:

'and that is true, and cuckoo shall go and ask the man
liu, and he knows her well and the thing can be done, for
cuckoo is clever enough, and if it is well done she shall
have the matchmaker's fee.'

'that will i do!' said cuckoo heartily and she laughed
as she thought of the fee of good silver on her palm, and
she untied her apron from her waist and she said busily,
'now and at once will i go, for the meat is ready except
for the moment of cooking and the vegetables are washed.'

but wang lung had not pondered the matter sufficient-
ly and it was not to be decided so quickly as this and he
called out :



182



'no, and i have decided nothing. i must think of the
matter for some days and i will tell you what i think.'
 
 ___________________________
 


the women were impatient, cuckoo for the silver and
lotus because it was a new thing and she would hear
something new to amuse her: but wang lung went out,
saying :

c no, it is my son and i will wait.'

and so he might have waited for many days, thinking
of this and that, had not the lad, his eldest son, come
home one day in the dawn with his face hot and red with
wine drinking, and his breath was fetid and his feet un-
steady. wang lung heard him stumbling in the court and
he ran out to see who it was, and the lad was sick a

aid
in sudden good humour:

'and who would not say aye to this, to be paid for
not working? and so i say aye also. it is true enough
that i desire men, and little boys are small pleasure.' and
she nodded at wang lung as she spoke and leered at him
and he was sickened at her coarse face and he said hastily :

'so be it, then.'

he turned quickly and he walked home, and as he walked
he spat and spat again to rid him of his sickness at the me-
mory of the woman.

on this day, therefore, he said to cuckoo:

'let it be as you said. go to the grain merchant and
arrange the matter. let the dowry be good but not too
great if the girl is suitable and if it can be arranged.'

when he had said this to cuckoo he went back to the
room and he sat beside his sleeping son and he brooded,
for he saw how fair and young the boy lay there, and he
saw the quiet face, asleep and smooth with its youth. then
when he thought of the weary painted woman and her thick
lips, his heart swelled with sickness and anger and

ld him, half-choking, what had
happened, and his uncle only laughed and he said:

'well, and can you keep a boy from becoming a man?
and can you keep a young dog from a stray bitch?'

when wang lung heard this laughter he remembered
in one crowded space of time all that he had endured
because of his uncle; how of old his uncle had tried to
force him to the selling of his land, and how they lived
here, these three, eating and drinking and idle, and how
his wife's uncle ate of the expensive foods cuckoo bought
for lotus, and now how his uncle's son had spoiled his own
fair lad, and he bit his tongue between his teeth and he said :

'now out of my house, you and yours, and no more
rice will there be for any of you from this hour, and i will
burn the house down rather than have it shelter you, who
have no gratitude even in your idleness!'

but his uncle sat where he was and ate on, now from
this bowl and now from that, and wang lung stood there
bursting with his blood, and when he saw his uncle

ld go into the town and go to the court
where the magistrate lived and say to him :

'my uncle is one of the redbeards.'

but if he did this, who would believe him , who would
believe a man when he told such a thing of his own father's



189



brother? it was more likely that he would be beaten for
his unfilial conduct rather than his uncle suffer, and in the
end he would go in fear of his life, for if the robbers heard
of it, they wculd kill him for revenge

then, as if this were not enough, cuckoo came back
from the grain merchant with news that although the affair
of the betrothal had gone well, the merchant liu was not
willing that anything should take place now except the
exchange of the betrothal papers, for the maid was too
young for marriage, being but fourteen years old, and must
w t ait for another three years. wang lung was dismayed
at three more years of this lad's anger and idleness and
mooning eyes, for he would not go to school now two days
out of ten, and wang lung shouted

forgot that he had ever had pride in
his son's writing and in his cleverness at books, and he

flung himself out, stamping his bare feet as he walked and
spitting upon the floor coarsely, because the fineness of his
son angered him for the moment. and the lad stood and
looked at him with hatred, but wang lung would not turn
back to see what the lad did.

nevertheless, that night when wang lung went into
the inner courts and sat beside lotus as she lay upon the
mat on her bed, where cuckoo fanned her as she lay,
lotus said to him idly as of a thing of no account, but only
•something to say:

'that big lad of yours is pining and desires to go away.'

then wang lung, remembering his anger against his
son, said sharply:

'well, and what is it to you? i will not have him in these
rooms at his age.'

but lotus made haste to reply, 'no — no — it is cuckoo
who says it.' and cuckoo made haste to say. 'any one
can see the thing and a lovely lad he is and too big for
idleness and lon

ging.'

wang lung was led aside by this and he thought only
of his anger against his son and he said :

'no, and he shall not go. i will not spend my money
foolishly.' and he would not speak of it any more and
lotus saw he was peevish from some anger, and she sent
cuckoo away and suffered him there alone.

then for many days there was nothing said and the
lad seemed suddenly content again, but he would not go
to school any more and this wang lung allowed him, for
the boy was nearly eighteen and large like his mother in
frame of bones, and he read in his own room when his
father came into the house and wang lung was content
and he thought to himself:

'it was a whim of his youth and he does not know what
he wants, and there are only three years — it may be a

 that she was none too young for all her
smallness of stature, and she never conceived to bear a
child for him. but for this he cared nothing, since he had
sons and daughters, and he was willing enough to keep her
for the pleasure she gave him.

as for lotus, she grew lovelier as her fullness of years
came on, for if before she had had a fault, it was her bird-
like thinness that made too sharp the lines of her little
pointed face and hollowed too much her temples. but
now, under the food which cuckoo cooked for her, and
under the idleness of her life with one man only, she be-
came soft and rounded in body, and her face grew full
and smooth at the temples, and with her wide eyes and
small mouth she looked more than ever like a plump little
cat. and she slept and ate and took on her body this soft,
smooth flesh. if she was no longer the lotus bud, neither
was she more than the full-blown, flower and if she was
not young, neither did she look old, and youth and age
were equally far from her.

her belly was as great as though with child these three
years, only there was no birth. but she rose at dawn and /

or a pig that would not eat. and she did her work alone
and spoke no more than she could escape speaking with
the wife of wang lung's uncle, and she never spoke at all
to cuckoo. never once had o-lan gone into the inner
courts, and rarely, if lotus came out to walk a little in a
place other than her own court, o-lan went into her room
and sat until one said, 4 she is gone.' and she said nothing
but she worked at her cooking and at the washing at the
pool even in the winter when the water was stiff with ice
to be broken. but wang lung never thought to say:

'well, and why do you not with the silver i have to
spare, hire a servant or buy a slave?'

coat, such as he had never seen her dressed in by the light
of the morning.

these two talked together, and the woman laughed
lightly and looked at the young man from the corner of
her eyes, her head turned aside, and they did not hear
wang lung. he stood and stared at them, his face whitening
and his lips lifted back and snarling from his teeth, and
his hands tightened about the bamboo. and still the two
did not hear him and would not, except that the woman
cuckoo came out and saw him and shrieked and they saw.

then wang lung leaped forward and he fell on his son,
lashing him, and although the lad was taller than he, he
was stronger from his labour in the fields and from the
robustness of his mature body, and he beat the lad until
the blood streamed down. when lotus screamed and drag-
ged at his arm he shook her off, and when she persisted,
screaming, he beat her also and he beat her until she fled
and he beat the young man until he stopped cowering to

then he rose wearily and he went into the room and
lotus lay there on her bed, weeping aloud, and he went
up to her and he turned her over, and she lay looking at
him and weeping and there on her face lay the swollen
purple mark of his whip.

and he said to her with great sadness:

'so you must ever be a whore and go a-whoring after
my own sons!'

and she cried more loudly at this and protested:

'no, but i did not, and the lad was lonely and came
in and you may ask cuckoo if he ever came nearer to my
bed than you saw him in the court!'

then she looked at him frightened and piteous and she
reached for his hand and drew it across the welt on her
face and she whimpered :

'see what you have done to your lotus — and there
is no man in the world except you, and if it is your son,
it is only your son, and what is he to me!'

she looked up at him, her pretty eyes swimming in
her clear tears, and he groaned because this woman's
beauty was more than he could wish and

light and yellow-skinned, and there was that in him which
reminded wang lung of his own father, a crafty, sharp,
humorous eye, and a turn for malice if the moment came
for it. and wang lung said:

'well, and this boy will make a good merchant and i
will take him out of school and see if he can be apprenticed
in the grain market. it will be a convenient thing to have
a son there where i sell my harvests and he cl;i watch the
scales and tip the weight a little in my favour.'

therefore he said to cuckoo one day:

'now go and tell the father of my eldest son's betrothed
that i have something to say to him. and we should at
any rate drink a cup of wine together, seeing that we are
to be poured into one bowl, his blood and mine.'

cuckoo went, then, and came back saying:

'he will see you when you wish and if you can come
to drink wine this noon it is well, and if you wish it he
will come here instead.'

but wang lung did not wish the town merchant to
come to his house because he feared he would

have to

prepare this and that, and so he washed himself and put
on his silk coat and he set out across the fields. he went
first to the street of bridges, as cuckoo had told him, and
there before a gate which bore the name of liu he stopped.
not that he knew the word himself, but he guessed the
gate, two doors to the right of the bridge, and he asked
one who passed and the letter was the letter of liu. it
was a respectable gate built plainly of wood, and wang
lung struck it with the palm of his hand.

immediately it opened and a woman servant stood there,
wiping her wet hands on her apron as she spoke to
ask who he was, and when he answered his name, she

i'no,' she said simply, 'and my mother said i was not
to weep aloud because you are too kind and weak for
pain and you might say to leave me as i am, and then my
husband would not love me even as you do not love her.'

this she said as simply as a child recites a tale x _and
wang lung was stabbed at hearing this, that o-lan had
told the child he did not love her who was the child's
' mother, and he said quickly:

j 'well, and to-day i have heard of a pretty husband for
1 you, and we will see if cuckoo can arrange the matter.'
r then the child smiled and dropped her head, suddenly
a maid and no more a child. and wang lung said to
cuckoo on that same evening when he was in the inner
court :

p" 'go and see if it can be done.'

but he slept uneasily beside lotus that night and he
j woke and fell to thinking of his life of how o-lan had
been the first woman he had known and how she had
been a faithful servant beside him. and he thought of
what the child said, and he was sad, because with all her
 
 ___________________________
 
repulsion towards it.

and because of this, he was more kind to her and he
bought her special food and delicate soups made of white
fish and the hearts of young cabbages. moreover, he could
not take his pleasure of lotus, for when he went in to her
to distract his mind from its despair over this long agony
of dying, he could not forget o-lan, and even as he held
lotus, he loosed her, because of o-lan.

there were times when o-lan woke to herself and to
what was about her and once she called for cuckoo, and
when in great astonishment wang lung summoned the
woman, o-lan raised herself trembling upon her arm, and
she said plainly enough:

'well, and you may have lived in the courts of the
old lord, and you were accounted beautiful, but i have
been a man's wife and i have borne him sons, and you
are still a slave.'

when cuckoo would have answered angrily to this,
wang lung besought her and led her out, saying:

'that one does not know what words mean now/

when he went back into the room, o-lan

her hair for herself, and she asked for tea to
drink, and when wang lung came she said:

'now the new year is coming and there are no cakes
and no meats ready, and i have thought of a thing. i will
not have that slave in my kitchen, but i would have you
send for my daughter-in-law, who is betrothed to our eldest
son. i have not seen her yet, but when she comes i will
tell her what to do/

wang lung was pleased' at her strength, although he
cared nothing for festivities on this year, and he sent cuckoo
in to beseech liu, the grain merchant, seeing how sad the
case was. and after a while liu was willing when he heard
that o-lan would not live the winter out, perhaps, and after
all the girl was sixteen and older than some who go to
their husband's houses.

but because of o-lan there were no feastings. the maiden
came quietly in a sedan chair, except that her mother and
an old servant came with her, and her mother went back
when she had delivered the maiden to o-lan, but the
servant remained for
 
 ___________________________
 
though
she did not speak again, but lay back and closed her eyes,
smiling a little.

wang lung dispatched the man, therefore, and told
him:

'tell your young lord that his mother is dying and her
spirit cannot rest in ease until she sees him and sees him
wed, and if he values me and his mother and his home, he
must come back before he draws another breath, for on
the third day from now i will have feasts prepared and
guests invited and he will be wed.'

and as wang lung said, so he did. he bade cuckoo
provide a feast as best she could, and she was to call in
cooks from the tea-shop in town to help her, and he poured
silver into her hands and he said :



213



'do as it would have been done in the great house at
such an hour, and there is more silver than this.'

then he went into the village and invited guests, men
and women, every one whom he knew, and he went into
the town and invited whom he knew at the tea-shops and
at the grain markets and every one whom he knew. and
he said to his un

his mother.

then the young man sat beside his mother's bed and
the tears stood in his eyes to see her thus, but he would
not say anything except cheerful things such as these, 'you
look twice as well as they said and years away from death.'
but o-lan said simply:

£ i will see you wed and then i must die.'

now the maid who was to be wed must not of course
be seen by the young man and lotus took her into the
inner court to prepare her for marriage, and none could do
this better than lotus and cuckoo and the wife of wang
lung's uncle. these three took the maid and on the morn-
ing of her wedding-day they washed her clean from head
to foot, and bound her feet freshly with new white cloths
under her new stockings, and lotus rubbed into her flesh

some fragrant almond oil of her own. then they dressed
her in garments she had brought from her home; white
flowered silk next her sweet virgin flesh and then a light
coat of sheep's wool of the finest and most curling kind,
and then the red

 wed. then they bowed again to o-lan and to
wang lung and then they went out and together they
bowed to the assembled guests.

then the feasting began and the rooms and the courts
were filled with tables and with the smell of cooking and
with the sound of laughter, for the guests came from far
and wide, those whom wang lung had invited and with
them many whom wang lung had never seen, since it was
known he was a rich man and food would never be missed
or counted in his house at such a time. and cuckoo had
brought cooks from the town to prepare the feast, for there

216



were to be many delicacies such as cannot be prepared in
a farmer's kitchen and the town cooks came bearing great
baskets of food ready cooked and only to be heated, and
they made much of themselves and flourished their grimy
aprons and bustled here and there in their zeal. and every
one ate more and yet more and drank all he was able to
hold, and they were all very merry.

o-lan would have all the doors open and the curtai

r and there could be
no harvest then the next year. and he looked well to his
own house and to the spending of money and food, and j
he quarrelled heartily with guckoo because for a long time j
she would still buy meat in the town, and he was glad at
last, since there must be flood, that the water kept between
his house and the town, so that she could no longer go to
market when she would, for he would not allow the boats
to be put forth except when he said, and ching listened to
him and not to cuckoo, for all her sharpness of tongue.

wang lung allowed nothing to be bought and sold after i
the winter came except what he said, and he husbanded
carefully all that they had. every day he gave out to his
daughter-in-law what food was needed in the house for that
day, and to ching he gave out what the labourers should
have, although it hurt him to feed idle men, and it hurt |
him so greatly that at last when winter cold came and the
water froze over, he bade the men begone to the south to
beg and

d nothing wherewith to buy seed and ploughs
and oxen, they sold their daughters, and there were those
who came to wang lung to sell, because it was known he
was rich and powerful and a man of good heart.

and he, thinking constantly of the child to come and
of others to come from his sons when they were all wed,
bought five slaves, two about twelve years of age with big
feet and strong bodies, and two younger to wait upon them
all and fetch and carry, and one to wait on the person of
lotus, for cuckoo grew old and since the second girl was

231



gone there had been none other to work in the house.
and the five he bought in one day, for he was a man rich
enough to do quickly what he decided upon.

then one day many days later a man came bearing a
small, delicate maid of seven years or so, wanting to sell
her, and wang lung said he would not have her at first,
for she was so small and weak. but lotus saw her and
fancied her and she said pettishly :

'now this one 1 will have because she is s

when wang lung had decided aj
thing he could not do it quickly enough. as he grew
older he grew impatient to have done with things and to sit in ]
the latter part of the day at peace and idle and to watch
the late sun and sleep a little after he had strolled about his
land. so he told his elder son what he had decided and he
commanded the young man to arrange the matter, and
he sent for his second son to come and help with the moving
and on a day when they were ready they moved, first lotus
and cuckoo and their slaves and goods, and then wang
lung's eldest son and his wife and their servants and the j
slaves.

but wang lung himself would not go. at once, and he
kept with him his youngest son. when the moment came
for leaving the land whereon he was born he could not do
it easily nor so quickly as he had thought and he said to
his sons when they urged him:

' well then, prepare a court for me to use alone and on |
a day that i wish i will come, and it will be a day before my j

foods, and he himself, who once had been well satisfied
with good wheaten bread wrapped about a stick of garlic,
now that he slept late in the day and did not work with
his own hands on the land, was not easily pleased with this
dish and that, and he tasted winter bamboo and shrimps'
rose and southern fish and shellfish from the northern seas
and pigeons' eggs and all those things which rich men use
to force their lagging appetites. and his son's ate and lotus

also, and cuckoo, seeing all that had come about, laughed
and said:

'well, and it is like the old days when i was in these
courts, only this body of mine is withered and dried now
and not fit even for an old lord.

saying this, she glanced slyly at wang lung and laughed
again, and he pretended not to hear her lewdness, but he
was pleased, nevertheless, that she had compared him to
the old lord.

so with this idle and luxurious living and rising when
they would and sleeping when they would, he waited for
his gr

andson. then one morning he heard the groans of
a woman and he went into the courts of his eldest son
and his son met him and said:

'the hour is come, but cuckoo says it will be long,
for the woman is narrowly made and it is a hard birth.'

sctwang lung went back to his own court and he sat
down and listened to the cries, and for the first time in
many years he was frightened and felt the need of some
spirit's aid. he rose and went to the incense shop and he
bought incense and he went to the temple in the town
where the goddess of mercy dwells in her gilded alcove '
and he summoned an idling priest and gave him money
and bade him thrust the incense befo

r to
bring him a towel dipped and wrung from steaming water
to wipe his face, but though he clapped his hands none
came. no one heeded him, and there was running to and
fro, but he dared to stop no one to ask what sort of a
child had been born or even if any had been born. he
sat there dusty and spent and no one spoke to him.

then at last, when it seemed to him it must soon be
night, so long he had waited, lotus came, in waddling upon
her small feet because of her great weight and leaning upon
cuckoo, and she laughed and said joudly:

£ well, and there is a son in the house of your son, and
both mother and son are alive. i have seen the child and
it is fair and sound.'

then wang lung laughed also and he rose and he
slapped his hands together and laughed again and he said :

'well, and i have been sitting here like a man with
his own first son coming and not knowing what to do of
this and that and afraid of everything.'

and then when lotus had gone on to her room and
he sat again he fell

bles carefully,
keeping the best meats for his friends in the town who
knew the cost of the dishes, and for the tenants and the
country people who must be invited he spread tables in
the courts, and to these he gave only the second best in
meat and wine, since they daily ate coarse fare, and to
them a little better was very good.

and the second son watched the money and the gifts
that came in, and he gave to the slaves and servants the

least that could be given them, so that cuckoo sneered
when into her hand he put a paltry two pieces of silver
and she said in the hearing of many:

'now a truly great family is not so careful of its silver
and one can see that this family does not rightly belong
in these courts.'

the eldest son heard this, and he was ashamed and
he was afraid of her tongue and he gave her more silver
secretly and he was angry with his second brother. thus
there was trouble between them even on the very wedding-
day when the guests sat about the tables and
 
 ___________________________
 
e the place where his own was
f to be.

\ then wang lung caused mourning to be made for
i the whole family and they wore the sign of mourning for

260



a year, not because any truly mourned the passing of this
old man who had never been anything but a care to them,
but because it is fitting so to do in a great family when a
relative dies.

then wang lung moved his uncle's wife into the town
where she would not be alone, and he gave her a room at
the end of a far court for her own, and he told cuckoo
to supervise a slave in the care of her, and the old woman
sucked her opium pipe and lay on her bed in great con-
tent, sleeping day after day, and her coffin was beside her
where she could see it for her comfort.

and wang lung marvelled to think that once he had
feared for a great fat blowsy country woman, idle and
loud, she who lay there now, shrivelled and yellow and
silent, as shrivelled and yellow as the old mistress had
been in the fallen house of hwang.

re long!'

then the three of them looked at each other heavily,
and thought of their women and of these lusty, hungry
men. and the eldest son thought of his goodly, proper
wife, and he said :

c we must put the women together in the innermost
court and we must watch there day and night and keep
the gates barred and the back gate of peace ready to be
loosed and opened/

thus they did. they took the women and the children
and they put them all into the inner court where lotus
had lived alone with cuckoo and her maids, and there in
discomfort and crowding they lived. the eldest son and
wang lung watched the gate day and night and the
second son came when he could, and they watched as
carefully by night as by day.

but there was that one, the cousin, and because he was

264



a relative none could lawfully keep him out and he beat
on the gate and he would come in and he walked about
at will, carrying his knife shining and glittering and open
in his hand. the eldest son followed him about, his f

ow my cousin wang lung were rich i should know
by looking at you, such a mountain of flesh you have
become, and well you have eaten and how richly! it is
only rich men's wives who can look like you!'

now lotus was mightily pleased that he called her old
mistress, because it is a title that only the ladies of great
families may have, and she laughed deep and gurgling,
out of her fat throat and she blew the ash out of her pipe
and handed the pipe to a slave to fill again, and she said
turning to cuckoo:

'well, this coarse fellow has a turn for a joke!'

and as she said this she looked at the cousin out of
eyes coquettishly, although such glances, now that her
eyes were no longer large and apricot-shaped in her great
cheeks, were less coy than they once were, and seeing the
look she gave him, the cousin laughed in uproar and cried
out:

'well, and it is an old bitch, still!' and he laughed again
loudly.

and all this time the eldest son stood there in anger
and in silence.

then when the cous

as they would, and though they crushed the delicate carvings
of chairs with their great leathern boots, and though they
sullied with their private filth the pools where the flecked
and golden fish swam, so that the fish died and floated on
the water and rotted there, with their white bellies upturned.

for the cousin ran in and out as he would and he cast
eyes at the slaves, and wang lung and his sons looked at
each other out of their eyes haggard and sunken because
they dared not sleep. then cuckoo saw it and she said:

'now there is only one thing to do, he must be given
a slave for his pleasure while he is here, or else he will be
taking where he should not.'

and wang lung seized eagerly on what she said be-
cause it seemed to him he could not endure his life .any
more with all the trouble there was in his house, and so
he said:

£ it is a good thought.'

and he bade cuckoo go and ask the cousin what slave
he would have since he had seen them all.

so cuckoo did, then, and she came ba

ck and she said:

'he says he will have the little pale one who sleeps on
the bed of the mistress.'

now this pale slave was called pear blossom and the
one wang lung had bought in a famine year when she
was small and piteous and half-starved, and because she

267



was delicate always they had petted her and allowed her
only to help cuckoo and to do the lesser things about i
lotus, filling her pipe and pouring her tea, and it was thus i
the cousin had seen her.

now when pear blossom heard this she cried out as
she poured the tea for lotus, for cuckoo said it all out
before them in the inner court where they sat, and she
dropped the pot and it broke into pieces on the tiles and
the tea all streamed out, but the maid did not see what
she had done. she only threw herself down before lotus
and she knocked her head on the tiles and s

he moaned
forth:

'oh, my mistress, not i — not i — i am afraid of him for
my life '

and lotus was displeased with her and she answered
pettishly:

'now he is only a man and a man is no more than a
man with a maid and they are all alike, and what is this
ado?' and he turned to cuckoo and said, 'take this slave
and give her to him.'

then the young maid put her hands together piteously
and cried as though she would die of weeping and fear
and her little body was all trembling with her fear, and
she looked from this face to that, beseeching with her
weeping.

now the sons of wang lung could not speak against
their father's wife, nor could their wives speak if they did
not, nor could the youngest son, but he stood there staring
at her, his hands clenched on his bosom and his b

ooked at the young girl doubtfully, not caring to anger
lotus but still moved, because he had always a soft heart.
then the maid saw his heart in his face and she ran and
held his feet with her hands and she bent her head down
to his feet and wept on in great sobs. and he looked
down at her and saw how small her shoulders were and



268



how they shook and he remembered the great, coarse, wild
body of his cousin, now long past his youth, and a distaste
for the thing seized him and he said to cuckoo, his voice

' well now, it is ill to force the young maid like this.'
these words he said mildly enough, but lotus cried

out sharply: .

'she is to do as she is told, and i say it is foolish, all this
weeping over a small thing that must happen soon or late
with all women.'

but wang lung was indulgent and he said to lotus :

'let us see first what else can be done, and let me buy
for you another slave if you will, or what you will, but let
me see what can be done.'

then lotus, who had long b

een minded for a toreign
clock and a new ruby ring, was suddenly silent and wang
lung said to cuckoo : .

'go and tell my cousin the girl has a vile and incur-
able disease, but if he will have her with that, then well
enough and she shall come to him, but if he fears it as
we all do, then tell him we have another and a sound ,

oi1 and he cast his eyes over the slaves who stood about
and they turned away their faces and giggled and made as
if they were ashamed, all except one stout wench, who was
already twenty or so, and she said with her face red and

k " well! 'and i have heard enough of t

have a mind to try it, if he will have me, and he is not so
hideous a man as some.'

then wang lung answered in relief:

'well, go then!'

and cuckoo said: •
'follow close behind me, for it will happen i know,
that he will seize the fruit nearest to him.' and they

went out. , c , i

but the little maid still clung to wang lung s feet, only
now she ceased her weeping and lay listening to what took
place. and lotus was still angry with her, and she rose
and went into her room without a word. then wang lung

269



raised the maid gently and she stood before him, drooping
and pale, and he saw that she had a little soft, oval face,
egg-shaped

re.

so while he laughed at lotus saying: 'what — are_y.au
thinking i am still a-lust, when i do not come into your
room thrice a year?' yet he looked sidelong at the girl
and he was stirred.

now lotus, for all she was ignorant in all ways except
the one, was learned in the way of men with women and
she knew that men when they are old will wake once again
to a brief youth, and so she was angry with the maid and
she talked of selling her to the tea-house. but still lotus
loved her comfort and cuckoo grew old and lazy and the
maid was quick and used about the person of lotus and
saw what her mistress needed before she knew it herself,
and so lotus was loath to part with her and yet she would
part with her, and in this unaccustomed conflict lotus was
the more angry because of her discomfort and she was



274



more hard than usual to live with. wang lung stayed
away from her court for many days at a time because her
temper was too ill to enjoy. he said to himself that he
would wait, thinki

th the touch
of her fluttering coat against his hand and with the quiet
resting of her body near him in the night. and he wondered
at the love of old age, which is so fond and so easily
satisfied.

as for her, she was a passionless maid and she clung
to him as to a father, and to him she was indeed more
than half child and scarcely woman.

now the thing that wang lung had done did not
quickly come out, for he said nothing at all, and why
should he, being master in his own house?

but the eye of cuckoo marked it first and she saw the
maid slipping at dawn out of his court and she laid hold
of the girl and laughed, and her old hawk's eyes glittered.

'w r ell!' she said. 'and so it is the old lord over again!'

and wang lung in his room, hearing her, girded his
robe about him quickly and he came out and smiled sheep-
ishly and half proudly and he said muttering:

'well, and i said she had better take a young lad and
she would have the old one!'

'it will be a pretty thing to tell the mistress,

' cuckoo
said then, and her eyes sparkled with malice.

'i do not know myself how the thing happened,' an-
swered wang lung slowly. 'i had not meant to add another

280



woman to my courts, and the thing came about of itself.'
then when cuckoo said, 'well, and the mistress must be
told,' wang lung, fearing the anger of lotus more than
anything begged cuckoo and he said again, 'do you tell
her, if you will, and if you can manage it without anger
to my face i will give you a handful of money for it.'

so cuckoo, still laughing and shaking her head, promised,
and wang lung went back to his court and he would
not come forth for a while until cuckoo came back and
said:

'well, and the thing is told, and she was angry enough
until i reminded her she wanted and has wanted this long
time the foreign clock you promised her, and she will have
a ruby ring fo

except you — i have hated every man,
even my father who sold me. i have heard only evil of
them and i hate them all.'

and he said wondering:

'now i should have said you had lived quietly and
easily in my courts.'

'i am filled with loathing,' she said, looking away. 'i
am filled with loathing and i hate them all. i hate all
young men.'

and she would say nothing more, and he mused on it,
and he did not know whether lotus had filled her with
tales of her life and threatened her, or w whether cuckoo
had frightened her with lewdness, or whether something
had befallen her secretly that she would not tell him, or
what it was.

but he sighed and gave over his questions, because
above everything now he would have peace, and he wished
only to sit in his court near these two.

so wang lung sat, and so his age came on him day
by day and year by year, and he slept fitfully in the sun
as his father had done, and he said to himself that his life
was done and he was satisfied with it.

sometimes, but

seldom, he went into other courts, and
sometimes, but more seldom, he saw lotus, and she never
mentioned the maid he had taken, but she greeted him
well enough, for she was old too and satisfied with the
food and the wine she loved and with the silver she had
for the asking. she and cuckoo sat together now after
these many years as friends and no longer as mistress and
servant, and they talked of this and that, and most^of all
of the old days with men and they whispered together of
things they would speak aloud, and they ate and drank
and slept, and woke to gossip again before eating and
drinking.

and when wang lung went, and it was very seldom,?
into his sons' courts they treated him courteously and they
ran to get tea for him and he asked to see the last child
and he asked man

then they laughed with clear young scorn at a man so
old as this and they said:

'no grandfather, and no one studies the four books
since the revolution.'

and he answered, musing:

'ah, i have heard of a revolution, but i have been too
busy in my life to attend to it. there was always the land.'

but the lads snickered at this, and at last wang lung
[ rose, feeling himself after all but a guest in his sons'
courts.

then after a time he went no more to see his sons,
but sometimes he would ask cuckoo:

'and are my two daughters-in-law at peace after all these
years?'

and cuckoo spat upon the ground and she said:
'those? they are at peace like two cats eyeing each
other. but the eldest son wearies of his wife's complaints
of this and that — too proper a woman for a man, she is,
and always talking of what they did in the house of her
father, and she wearies a man. there is talk of his taking
another. he goes often to the tea-shops.'
'ah!' said wang lung.

but when he would have thought of

of his tea and that the young spring wind smote cold upon
his shoulders.

and another time he said to cuckoo :

'does any ever hear from that youngest son of mine
where he is gone this long time?'

and cuckoo answered, for there was nothing she did
not know in these courts:

'well, and he does not write a letter, but now and then
one comes from the south and it is said he is a military
official and great enough in a thing they call a revolution
there, but what it is i dq not know — perhaps some sort
of business/

and again wang lung said, ' ah!'

and he would have thought of it, but the evening was
falling and his bones ached in the air left raw and chill
when the sun withdrew. for his mind now we
