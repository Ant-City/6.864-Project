[CHARACTER] - 
                	the
youngest son of sir rowland de bois and younger brother of oliver.
[CHARACTER] is an attractive young man who, under his brother's neglectful
care, has languished without a gentleman's education or training. regardless,
he considers himself to have great potential, and his victorious
battle with charles proves him right. [CHARACTER] cares for the aging
adam in the forest of ardenne and later risks his life to save oliver from
a hungry lioness, proving himself a proper gentleman. he is a fitting
hero for the play and, though he proves no match for her wit or
poetry, the most obvious romantic match for rosalind.
