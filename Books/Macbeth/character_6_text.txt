and the right valiant banquo walk'd too late,
whom you may say (if't please you) fleans kill'd,
for fleans fled: men must not walke too late.
who cannot want the thought, how monstrous
it was for malcolme, and for donalbane
to kill their gracious father? damned fact,
how it did greeue macbeth? did he not straight
in pious rage, the two delinquents teare,
that were the slaues of drinke, and thralles of sleepe?
was not that nobly done? i, and wisely too:
for 'twould haue anger'd any heart aliue
to heare the men deny't. so that i say,
he ha's borne all things well, and i do thinke,
