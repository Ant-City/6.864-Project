well, look," said brent.  "let's go over to the wilkes.  ashley
and the girls'll be glad to have us for supper."

stuart looked a little discomforted.

"no, don't let's go there.  they'll be in a stew getting ready for
the barbecue tomorrow and besides--"

"oh, i forgot about that," said brent hastily.  "no, don't let's
go there."

they clucked to their horses and rode along in silence for a
while, a flush of embarrassment on stuart's brown cheeks.  until
the previous summer, stuart had courted india wilkes with the
approbation of both families and the entire county.  the county
felt that perhaps the cool and contained india wilkes would have a
quieting effect on him.  they fervently hoped so, at any rate.
and stuart might have made the match, but brent had not been
satisfied.  brent liked india but he thought her mighty plain and
tame, and he simply could not fall in love with her himself to
keep stuart company.  that was the first time the twins' interest
had ever diverged, and brent was resentf

er and, inspired by the thought that
she considered them a remarkable pair, they fairly outdid
themselves.

it was a memorable day in the life of the twins.  thereafter, when
they talked it over, they always wondered just why they had failed
to notice scarlett's charms before.  they never arrived at the
correct answer, which was that scarlett on that day had decided to
make them notice.  she was constitutionally unable to endure any
man being in love with any woman not herself, and the sight of
india wilkes and stuart at the speaking had been too much for her
predatory nature.  not content with stuart alone, she had set her
cap for brent as well, and with a thoroughness that overwhelmed
the two of them.

now they were both in love with her, and india wilkes and letty
munroe, from lovejoy, whom brent had been half-heartedly courting,
were far in the back of their minds.  just what the loser would
do, should scarlett accept either one of them, the twins did not
ask.  they would cross that bridge whe

fan, the swaying of the hips so that skirts swung like a bell, the
tears, the laughter, the flattery, the sweet sympathy.  oh, all
the tricks that never failed to work--except with ashley.

no, it didn't seem right to learn all these smart tricks, use them
so briefly and then put them away forever.  how wonderful it would
be never to marry but to go on being lovely in pale green dresses
and forever courted by handsome men.  but, if you went on too
long, you got to be an old maid like india wilkes and everyone
said "poor thing" in that smug hateful way.  no, after all it was
better to marry and keep your self-respect even if you never had
any more fun.

oh, what a mess life was!  why had she been such an idiot as to
marry charles of all people and have her life end at sixteen?

her indignant and hopeless reverie was broken when the crowd began
pushing back against the walls, the ladies carefully holding their
hoops so that no careless contact should turn them up against
their bodies and

ently the thought was not new to suellen who sat in the back of
the wagon, for she suddenly began to cry.  she had not heard from
frank kennedy since christmas.  she did not know if the lack of
mail service was the cause, or if he had merely trifled with her
affections and then forgotten her.  or maybe he had been killed in
the last days of the war!  the latter would have been infinitely
preferable to his forgetting her, for at least there was some
dignity about a dead love, such as carreen and india wilkes had,
but none about a deserted fiancee.

"oh, in the name of god, hush!" said scarlett.

"oh, you can talk," sobbed suellen, "because you've been married
and had a baby and everybody knows some man wanted you.  but look
at me!  and you've got to be mean and throw it up to me that i'm an
old maid when i can't help myself.  i think you're hateful."

"oh, hush!  you know how i hate people who bawl all the time.  you

hedge, interlaced
with sweet-smelling honeysuckle vines.  here and there in the
grass, roses threw out sprangles from crushed old stems and pink
and white crepe myrtle bloomed as valiantly as if war had not
passed over their heads and yankee horses gnawed their boughs.

scarlett thought it quite the ugliest dwelling she had ever seen
but, to melanie, twelve oaks in all its grandeur had not been more
beautiful.  it was home and she and ashley and beau were at last
together under their own roof.

india wilkes came back from macon, where she and honey had lived
since 1864, and took up her residence with her brother, crowding
the occupants of the little house.  but ashley and melanie welcomed
her.  times had changed, money was scarce, but nothing had altered
the rule of southern life that families always made room gladly for
indigent or unmarried female relatives.

honey had married and, so india said, married beneath her, a coarse
westerner from mississippi who had settled in macon.  he had a red

suspicion.  it was almost a certainty and a
terrible certainty.  she looked up into rhett's immobile face and
for a moment she could not speak.  then:

"was frank at--belle watling's?"

"no."

rhett's voice was blunt.

"archie's carrying him to the vacant lot near belle's.  he's dead.
shot through the head."



chapter xlvi


few families in the north end of town slept that night for the news
of the disaster to the klan, and rhett's stratagem spread swiftly
on silent feet as the shadowy form of india wilkes slipped through
back yards, whispered urgently through kitchen doors and slipped
away into the windy darkness.  and in her path, she left fear and
desperate hope.

from without, houses looked black and silent and wrapped in sleep
but, within, voices whispered vehemently into the dawn.  not only
those involved in the night's raid but every member of the klan was
ready for flight and in almost every stable along peachtree street,
horses stood saddled in the darkness, pistols in holsters and food

i shall never marry again."

"oh, yes, you will.  you were born to be married.  why not me?"

"but rhett, i--i don't love you."

"that should be no drawback.  i don't recall that love was
prominent in your other two ventures."

"oh, how can you?  you know i was fond of frank!"

he said nothing.

"i was!  i was!"

"well, we won't argue that.  will you think over my proposition
while i'm gone?"

"rhett, i don't like for things to drag on.  i'd rather tell you
now.  i'm going home to tara soon and india wilkes will stay with
aunt pittypat.  i want to go home for a long spell and--i--i don't
ever want to get married again."

"nonsense.  why?"

"oh, well--never mind why.  i just don't like being married."

"but, my poor child, you've never really been married.  how can you
know?  i'll admit you've had bad luck--once for spite and once for
money.  did you ever think of marrying--just for the fun of it?"

"fun!  don't talk like a fool.  there's no fun being married."

"no?  why not?"
