it does not matter that only a few in each generation will grasp and achieve the full reality of 
man's proper stature--and that the rest will betray it. it is those few that move the world and 
give life its meaning--and it is those few that i have always sought to address. the rest are no

i offer my profound gratitude to the great profession of architecture and its heroes who have 
given us some of the highest expressions of man's genius, yet have remained unknown, 
undiscovered by the majority of men. and to the architects who gave me their generous 
assistance in the technical matters of this book.

titles of the newspaper columns were invented and used by me

"that's our answer, howard. that's the answer given to you and to me. this paper. that it 
exists and that it's liked. can you fight that? have you any words to be heard and understood 
by that? they shouldn't have sent us the letter. they should have sent a copy of wynand's 
banner. it would be simpler and clearer. do you know that in a few years that incredible 
bastard, gail wynand, will rule the world? it will be a beautiful world. and perhaps he's right."

mink coat. she never wanted the damn village. and wynand knew it, too. but there it stands, 
on the hudson. last week, he gave a party for her, right there, in that village--a costume party, 
with mr. wynand dressed as cesare borgia--wouldn't he, though?--and what a party!--if you 
can believe what you hear, but you know how it is, you can never prove anything on wynand.

from the powerful papers of the great wynand chain.

"we have always stood," said the wynand editorials, "for the rights of the common man 
against the yellow sharks of privilege, but we cannot give our support to the destruction of law 
and order." it had never been discovered whether the wynand papers led the public or the 
public led the wynand papers; it was known only that the two kept remarkably in step. it was 
not known to anyone, however, save to guy francon and a very few others, that gail wynand 
owned the corporation which owned the corporation which owned the noyes-belmont hotel.

this added greatly to francon's discomfort. gail wynand's real-estate operations were 
rumored to be vaster than his journalistic empire. it was the first chance francon had ever had 
at a wynand commission and he grasped it avidly, thinking of the possibilities which it could 
open. he and keating had put their best efforts into designing the most ornate of all rococo 
palaces for future patrons who could

pay twenty-five dollars per day per room and who were 
fond of plaster flowers, marble cupids and open elevator cages of bronze lace. the strike had 
shattered the future possibilities; francon could not be blamed for it, but one could never tell 
whom gail wynand would blame and for what reason. the unpredictable, unaccountable 
shifts of wynand's favor were famous, and it was well known that few architects he employed 
once were ever employed by him again.

francon's sullen mood led him to the unprecedented breach of snapping over nothing in 
particular at the one person who had always been immune from it--peter keating. keating 
shrugged, and turned his back to him in silent insolence. then keating wandered aimlessly

and had started as a department of art criticism, but grown into an informal tribune from which 
ellsworth m. toohey pronounced verdicts on art, literature, new york restaurants, 
international crises and sociology--mainly sociology. it had been a great success. but the 
building strike had placed ellsworth m. toohey in a difficult position. he made no secret of his 
sympathy with the strikers, but he had said nothing in his column, for no one could say what 
he pleased on the papers owned by gail wynand save gail wynand. however, a mass 
meeting of strike sympathizers had been called for this evening. many famous men were to 
speak, ellsworth toohey among them. at least, toohey's name had been announced.

the event caused a great deal of curious speculation and bets were made on whether toohey 
would dare to appear. "he will," keating had heard a draftsman insist vehemently, "he'll 
sacrifice himself. he's that kind. he's the only honest man in print."

"he won't," another had said. "do you re

wanted to be with you, peter...i want to be with you always." the thing gave a last jerk, not in 
the meaning of what she said, but in the reason that had prompted her to say it. then it was 
gone, and keating smiled; his fingers sought her bare wrist between her sleeve and glove, 
and her skin was warm against his....

many days later keating heard the story that was being told all over town. it was said that on 
the day after the mass meeting gail wynand had given ellsworth toohey a raise in salary. 
toohey had been furious and had tried to refuse it. "you cannot bribe me, mr. wynand," he 
said. "i'm not bribing you," wynand had answered; "don't flatter yourself."
#

when the strike was settled, interrupted construction went forward with a spurt throughout the 
city, and keating found himself spending days and nights at work, with new commissions 
pouring into the office. francon smiled happily at everybody and gave a small party for his

"is that what you really think of them?"

"not at all. but i don't like people who try to say only what they think i think."

"thanks. i'll need your help. i've never met anyone...oh, no, of course, that's what you didn't 
want me to say. but i really meant it about your papers. i've always admired gail wynand. i've 
always wished i could meet him. what is he like?"

"just what austen heller called him--an exquisite bastard." he winced. he remembered where 
he had heard austen heller say that. the memory of catherine seemed heavy and vulgar in 
the presence of the thin white hand he saw hanging over the arm of the chair before him.

"but, i mean," he asked, "what's he like in person?"

"i don't know. i've never met him."

"you haven't?"

"no."

"oh, i've heard he's so interesting!"

lications. it lent itself to 
sunday-supplement illustrations of girls leaping into rivers, their skirts flaring well above their 
knees. it boosted circulation. it embarrassed the sharks who owned a stretch of blocks by the 
east river, selected as the dire example of the campaign. the sharks had refused to sell 
these blocks to an obscure real-estate company; at the end of the campaign they surrendered 
and sold. no one could prove that the real-estate company was owned by a company owned 
by gail wynand.

the wynand papers could not be left without a campaign for long. they had just concluded 
one on the subject of modern aviation. they had run scientific accounts of the history of 
aviation in the sunday family magazine supplement, with pictures ranging from leonardo da 
vinci's drawings of flying machines to the latest bomber; with the added attraction of icarus 
writhing in scarlet flames, his nude body blue-green, his wax wings yellow and the smoke 
purple; also of a leprous hag with flami

xith century that man would fly; also of bats, vampires and werewolves.

they had run a model plane construction contest; it was open to all boys under the age of ten 
who wished to send in three new subscriptions to the banner. gail wynand, who was a 
licensed pilot, had made a solo flight from los angeles to new york, establishing a 
transcontinental speed record, in a small, specially built craft costing one hundred thousand 
dollars. he had made a slight miscalculation on reaching new york and had been forced to 
land in a rocky pasture; it had been a hair-raising landing, faultlessly executed; it had just so 
happened that a battery of photographers from the banner were present in the neighborhood.

experience. gail wynand had stood before the cameras, an immaculate gardenia in the lapel 
of his flying jacket, his hand raised with a cigarette held between two fingers that did not 
tremble. when questioned about his first wish on returning to earth, he had expressed the 
desire to kiss the most attractive woman present, had chosen the dowdiest old hag from the 
crowd and bent to kiss her gravely on the forehead, explaining that she reminded him of his 
mother.

after a while he stopped and remained silent, his eyes closed. then roark heard him whisper 
suddenly:

"gail wynand..."

roark leaned closer to him, bewildered.

toohey, because he was always first to make the most outrageous remarks about himself. 
once, at a party, a smug, boorish businessman listened to toohey's earnest social theories 
for a while and said complacently: "well, i wouldn't know much about all that intellectual stuff. i 
play the stock market."

"i," said toohey, "play the stock market of the spirit. and i sell short."

the most important consequence of sermons in stone was toohey's contract to write a daily 
column for gail wynand's new york banner.

the contract came as a surprise to the followers of both sides involved, and, at first, it made 
everybody angry. toohey had referred to wynand frequently and not respectfully; the wynand 
papers had called toohey every name fit to print. but the wynand papers had no policy, save 
that of reflecting the greatest prejudices of the greatest number, and this made for an erratic 
direction, but a recognizable direction, nevertheless: toward the inconsistent, the irresponsible,

; they supported strikes, when they wished, and vice versa. they denounced wall 
street and they denounced socialism and they hollered for clean movies, all with the same 
gusto. they were strident and blatant--and, in essence, lifelessly mild. ellsworth toohey was a 
phenomenon much too extreme to fit behind the front page of the banner.

but the staff of the banner was as unfastidious as its policy. it included everybody who could 
please the public or any large section thereof. it was said: "gail wynand is not a pig. he'll eat 
anything." ellsworth toohey was a great success and the public was suddenly interested in 
architecture; the banner had no authority on architecture; the banner would get ellsworth 
toohey. it was a simple syllogism.

thus "one small voice" came into existence.

the banner explained its appearance by announcing: "on monday the banner will present to 
you a new friend--ellsworth m. toohey--whose scintillating book sermons in stone you 
have all read and loved. the name o

 let us aspire to no virtue which 
cannot be shared."

"i have yet to see a genius or a hero who, if stuck with a burning match, would feel less pain 
than his undistinguished average brother."

"genius is an exaggeration of dimension. so is elephantiasis. both may be only a disease."

"we are all brothers under the skin--and i, for one, would be willing to skin humanity to prove 
it."

in the offices of the banner ellsworth toohey was treated respectfully and left alone. it was 
whispered that gail wynand did not like him--because wynand was always polite to him. 
alvah scarret unbent to the point of cordiality, but kept a wary distance. there was a silent, 
watchful equilibrium between toohey and scarret: they understood each other.

toohey made no attempt to approach wynand in any way. toohey seemed indifferent to all 
the men who counted on the banner. he concentrated on the others, instead.

he organized a club of wynand employees. it was not a labor union; it was just a club. it met

 month in the library of the banner. it did not concern itself with wages, hours or 
working conditions; it had no concrete program at all. people got acquainted, talked, and 
listened to speeches. ellsworth toohey made most of the speeches. he spoke about new 
horizons and the press as the voice of the masses. gail wynand appeared at a meeting once, 
entering unexpectedly in the middle of a session. toohey smiled and invited him to join the 
club, declaring that he was eligible. wynand did not join. he sat listening for half an hour, 
yawned, got up, and left before the meeting was over.

alvah scarret appreciated the fact that toohey did not try to reach into his field, into the 
important matters of policy. as a kind of return courtesy, scarret let toohey recommend new 
employees, when there was a vacancy to f

reply that he had not heard of such a group, but would answer: "i expected them to say it. 
didn't you?"

hopton stoddard received so many letters of sympathy that he began to feel quite happy. he 
had never been popular before. ellsworth, he thought, was right; his brother men were 
forgiving him; ellsworth was always right.

the better newspapers dropped the story after a while. but the banner kept it going. it had 
been a boon to the banner. gail wynand was away, sailing his yacht through the indian 
ocean, and alvah scarret was stuck for a crusade. this suited him. ellsworth toohey needed 
to make no suggestions; scarret rose to the occasion all by himself.

he wrote about the decline of civilization and deplored the loss of the simple faith. he 
sponsored an essay contest for high-school students on "why i go to church." he ran a 
series of illustrated articles on "the churches of our childhood." he ran photographs of 
religious sculpture th

"but, sweetheart..."

"or i'll have to quit."

"oh, go on, go on, go on, don't be silly. now don't get ridiculous. you know better than that.

"you'll have to choose, alvah."

scarret knew that he would get hell from gail wynand if he printed the thing, and might get 
hell if he lost dominique francon whose column was popular. wynand had not returned from 
his cruise. scarret cabled him in bali, explaining the situation.

within a few hours scarret received an answer. it was in wynand's private code. translated it

ntiveness, of listening quietly to something as simple 
as fate. he remained silent, and roark asked:

"what did you want to say to me?"

toohey looked at him, and then at the bare trees around them, at the river far below, at the 
great rise of the sky beyond the river.

"nothing," said toohey.

he walked away, his steps creaking on the gravel in the silence, sharp and even, like the 
cracks of an engine's pistons.

roark stood alone in the empty driveway, looking at the building.

part three: gail wynand

1.

gail wynand raised a gun to his temple.

he felt the pressure of a metal ring against his skin--and nothing else. he might have been 
holding a lead pipe or a piece of jewelry; it was just a small circle without significance. "i am 
going to die," he said aloud--and yawned.

he felt no relief, no despair, no fear. the moment of his end would not grant him even the 
dignity of seriousness. it was an anonymous moment; a few minutes ago, he had held a 
toothbrush in that hand; now he held a

gun with the same casual indifference.

one does not die like this, he thought. one must feel a great joy or a healthy terror. one must 
salute one's own end. let me feel a spasm of dread and i'll pull the trigger. he felt nothing.

he shrugged and lowered the gun. he stood tapping it against the palm of his left hand. 
people always speak of a black death or a red death, he thought; yours, gail wynand, will be 
a gray death. why hasn't anyone ever said that this is the ultimate horror? not screams, pleas 
or convulsions. not the indifference of a clean emptiness, disinfected by the fire of some great 
disaster. but this--a mean, smutty little horror, impotent even to frighten. you can't do it like 
that, he told himself, smiling coldly; it would be in such bad taste.

he walked to the wall of his bedroom. his penthouse was built above the fifty-seventh floor of 
a great residential hotel whi

 looking at the city. it was late and the 
great riot of lights below him was beginning to die down. he thought that he did not mind 
having to look at the city for many more years and he did not mind never seeing it again.

he leaned against the wall and felt the cold glass through the thin, dark silk of his pyjamas. a 
monogram was embroidered in white on his breast pocket: gw, reproduced from his 
handwriting, exactly as he signed his initials with a single imperial motion.

people said that gail wynand's greatest deception, among many, was his appearance. he 
looked like the decadent, overperfected end product of a long line of exquisite breeding--and 
everybody knew that he came from the gutter. he was tall, too slender for physical beauty, as 
if all his flesh and muscle had been bred away. it was not necessary for him to stand erect in 
order to convey an impression of hardness. like a piece of expensive steel, he bent, slouched 
and made people conscious, not of his pose, but of the feroc

or when. he could appear at any moment in any part of the building--and his presence was as 
unobtrusive as an electric shock. the employees tried to obey the rule as best they could; but 
they preferred three hours of overtime to ten minutes of working under his silent observation.

this morning, in his office, he went over the proofs of the banner's sunday editorials. he 
slashed blue lines across the spreads he wished eliminated. he did not sign his initials; 
everybody knew that only gail wynand could make quite that kind of blue slashes, lines that 
seemed to rip the authors of the copy out of existence.

he finished the proofs, then asked to be connected with the editor of the wynand herald, in 
springville, kansas. when he telephoned his provinces, wynand's name was never 
announced to the victim. he expected his voice to be known to every key citizen of his empire.

"good morning, cummings," he said when the editor answered.

"my god!" gasped the editor. "it isn't..."

 table in his office he spread out maps of stoneridge, his new real-estate venture, 
and spent half an hour discussing it with two of his agents. he had purchased a vast tract of 
land on long island, which was to be converted into the stoneridge development, a new 
community of small home owners, every curbstone, street and house to be built by gail 
wynand. the few people who knew of his real-estate activities had told him that he was crazy. 
it was a year when no one thought of building. but gail wynand had made his fortune on 
decisions which people called crazy.

the architect to design stoneridge had not been chosen. news of the project had seeped into 
the starved profession. for weeks wynand had refused to read letters or answer calls from 
the best architects of the country and their friends. he refused once more when, at the end of 
his conference, his secretary informed him that mr. ralston holcombe most urgently 
requested two minutes of his time on the telephone.

 of the chairwoman in an echoing banquet 
hall filled with the odors of corsages--gardenias and sweet peas--and of fried chicken. after 
luncheon wynand spoke. the convention advocated careers for married women; the wynand 
papers had fought against the employment of married women for many years. wynand spoke 
for twenty minutes and said nothing at all; but he conveyed the impression that he supported 
every sentiment expressed at the meeting. nobody had ever been able to explain the effect of 
gail wynand on an audience, particularly an audience of women. he did nothing spectacular; 
his voice was low, metallic, inclined to sound monotonous; he was too correct, in a manner 
that was almost deliberate satire on correctness. yet he conquered all listeners. people said it 
was his subtle, enormous virility; it made the courteous voice speaking about school, home 
and family sound as if he were making love to every old hag present.

returning to his office, wynand stopped in the city room. standing

urned to go. he was at the door when wynand added:

"you know, toohey, one of these days you'll bore me."

"i shall endeavor not to do so until the right time," said toohey, bowed again and went out.

when wynand returned to his home, he had forgotten all about ellsworth toohey.

that evening, in his penthouse, wynand had dinner with a woman who had a white face, soft 
brown hair and, behind her, three centuries of fathers and brothers who would have killed a 
man for a hint of the things which gail wynand had experienced with her.

the line of her arm, when she raised a crystal goblet of water to her lips, was as perfect as the 
lines of the silver candelabra produced by a matchless talent--and wynand observed it with 
the same appreciation. the candlelight flickering on the planes of her face made a sight of 
such beauty that he wished she were not alive, so that he could look, say nothing and think 
what he pleased.

"in a month or two, gail," she said, smiling lazily, "when it gets really col

now he stood at the glass wall, stopped by that very simplicity. one could make a bromide of 
one's life, he thought; but not of one's death.

he walked to the bed and sat down, the gun hanging in his hand. a man about to die, he 
thought, is supposed to see his whole life in a last flash. i see nothing. but i could make 
myself see it. i could go over it again, by force. let me find in it either the will to live on or the 
reason to end it now.

gail wynand, aged twelve, stood in the darkness under a broken piece of wall on the shore of 
the hudson, one arm swung back, the fist closed, ready to strike, waiting.

the stones under his feet rose to the remnant of a corner; one side of it hid him from the 
street; there was nothing behind the other side but a sheer drop to the river. an unlighted, 
unpaved stretch of waterfront lay before him, sagging structures and empty spaces of sky, 
warehouses, a crooked cornice hanging somewhere over a window wi

boys' gang was looking for him and that the leader would not 
come alone. two of the boys he expected fought with knives; one had a killing to his credit. 
he waited for them, his own pockets empty. he was the youngest member of the gang and 
the last to join. the leader had said that he needed a lesson.

it had started over the looting of the barges on the river, which the gang was planning. the 
leader had decided that the job would be done at night. the gang had agreed; all but gail 
wynand. gail wynand had explained, in a slow, contemptuous voice, that the little plug-
uglies, farther down the river, had tried the same stunt last week and had left six members in 
the hands of the cops, plus two in the cemetery; the job had to be done at daybreak, when no 
one would expect it. the gang hooted him. it made no difference. gail wynand was not good 
at taking orders. he recognized nothing but the accuracy of his own judgment. so the leader 
wished to settle the issue once and for all. the three bo

behind the thin walls they passed could not hear their steps. gail wynand heard them a block 
away. he did not move in his corner; only his wrist stiffened a little.

when the moment was right, he leaped. he leaped straight into space, without thought of 
landing, as if a catapult had sent him on a flight of miles. his chest struck the head of one 
enemy, his stomach another, his feet smashed into the chest of the third. the four of them 
went down. when the three lifted their faces, gail wynand was unrecognizable; they saw a 
whirl suspended in the air above them, a

sent the knife slicing down through wynand's side and flung it out at the belt. it was the last 
thing the boy saw. something happened to his chin and he did not feel it when the back of his 
head struck against a pile of old bricks.

for a long time the two others fought the centrifuge that was now spattering red drops against 
the walls around them. but it was no use. they were not fighting a man. they were fighting a 
bodiless human will.

when they gave up, groaning among the bricks, gail wynand said in a normal voice: "we'll 
pull it off at daybreak," and walked away. from that moment on, he was the leader of the 
gang.

the looting of the barges was done at daybreak, two days later, and came off with brilliant 
success.

gail wynand lived with his father in the basement of an old house in the heart of hell's 
kitchen. his father was a longshoreman, a tall, silent, illiterate man who had never gone to 
school. his own father and his grandfather were of the same kind, and they knew of

the politicians at a local club that was a gangsters' hangout. he had never gone to church or 
to school. he was twelve when he walked into a church. he listened to a sermon on patience 
and humility. he never came back. he was thirteen when he decided to see what education 
was like and enrolled at a public school. his father said nothing about this decision, as he said 
nothing whenever gail came home battered after a gang fight.

during his first week at school the teacher called on gail wynand constantly--it was sheer 
pleasure to her, because he always knew the answers. when he trusted his superiors and 
their purpose, he obeyed like a spartan, imposing on himself the kind of discipline he 
demanded of his own subjects in the gang. but the force of his will was wasted: within a week 
he saw that he needed no effort to be first in the class. after a month the teacher stopped 
noticing his presence; it seemed pointless, he always knew his lesson and she had to

er, duller children. he sat, unflinching, through hours that dragged like 
chains, while the teacher repeated and chewed and rechewed, sweating to force some spark 
of intellect from vacant eyes and mumbling voices. at the end of two months, reviewing the 
rudiments of history which she had tried to pound into her class, the teacher asked: "and how 
many original states were there in the union?" no hands were raised. then gail wynand's 
arm went up. the teacher nodded to him. he rose. "why," he asked, "should i swill everything 
down ten times? i know all that."

"you are not the only one in the class," said the teacher. he uttered an expression that struck 
her white and made her blush fifteen minutes later, when she grasped it fully. he walked to 
the door. on the threshold he turned to add: "oh yes. there were thirteen original states." 
that was the last of his formal education. there were people in hell's kitchen who n

ventured beyond its boundaries, and others who seldom stepped out of the tenement in which 
they were born. but gail wynand often went for a walk through the best streets of the city. he 
felt no bitterness against the world of wealth, no envy and no fear. he was simply curious and 
he felt at home on fifth avenue, just as anywhere else. he walked past the stately mansions, 
his hands in his pockets, his toes sticking out of flat-soled shoes. people glared at him, but it 
had no effect. he passed by and left behind him the feeling that he belonged on this street

first, and high-school primers afterward. there was no order in his reading; but there was 
order in what remained of it in his mind.

he discovered the reading room of the public library and he went there for a while--to study 
the layout. then, one day, at various times, a succession of young boys, painfully combed and 

unconvincingly washed, came to visit the reading room. they were thin when they came, but 
not when they left. that evening gail wynand had a small library of his own in the corner of 
his basement. his gang had executed his orders without protest. it was a scandalous 
assignment; no self-respecting gang had ever looted anything as pointless as books. but 
stretch wynand had given the orders--and one did not argue with stretch wynand. he was 
fifteen when he was found, one morning, in the gutter, a mass of bleeding pulp, both legs 
broken, beaten by some drunken longshoreman. he was unconscious when found. but he 
had been cons

cious that night, after the beating. he had been left alone in a dark alley. he 
had seen a light around the corner. nobody knew how he could have managed to drag 
himself around that corner; but he had; they saw the long smear of blood on the pavement 
afterward. he had crawled, able to move nothing but his arms. he had knocked against the 
bottom of a door. it was a saloon, still open. the saloonkeeper came out. it was the only time 
in his life that gail wynand asked for help. the saloonkeeper looked at him with a flat, heavy 
glance, a glance that showed full consciousness of agony, of injustice--and a stolid, bovine 
indifference. the saloonkeeper went inside and slammed the door. he had no desire to get 
mixed up with gang fights.

years later, gail wynand, publisher of the new york banner, still knew the names of the 
longshoreman and the saloonkeeper, and where to find them. he never did anything to the 
longshoreman. but he caused the saloonkeep

savings to be lost, and drove the man to suicide.

gail wynand was sixteen when his father died. he was alone, jobless at the moment, with 
sixty-five cents in his pocket, an unpaid rent bill and a chaotic erudition. he decided that the 
time had come to decide what he would make of his life. he went, that night, to the roof of his 
tenement and looked at the lights of the city, the city where he did not run things. he let his 
eyes move slowly from the windows of the sagging hovels around him to the windows of the 
mansions in the distance. there were onl

man swore and went on down. the nickel and the dime remained lying on the steps. wynand 
would not touch them. the story was repeated in the city room. a pimply-faced clerk shrugged 
and took the two coins.

at the end of the week, in a rush hour, a man from the city room called wynand to run an 
errand. other small chores followed. he obeyed with military precision. in ten days he was on 
salary. in six months he was a reporter. in two years he was an associate editor.

gail wynand was twenty when he fell in love. he had known everything there was to know 
about sex since the age of thirteen. he had had many girls. he never spoke of love, created 
no romantic illusion and treated the whole matter as a simple animal transaction; but at this he 
was an expert--and women could tell it, just by looking at him. the girl with whom he fell in

she became gail wynand's mistress. he allowed himself the weakness of being happy. he 
would have married her at once, had she mentioned it. but they said little to each other. he 
felt that everything was understood between them.

one evening he spoke. sitting at her feet, his face raised to her, he allowed his soul to be 
heard. "my darling, anything you wish, anything i am, anything i can ever be...that's what i 
want to offer you--not the things i'll get for you, but the thing in me that will make me able to

and had seen before: in the eyes of the saloonkeeper who had slammed 
the door. "how do you expect me to remember every piece of swill i write?" asked the editor.

after a moment, wynand said: "thanks." it was the only time in his life that he felt gratitude to 
anyone. the gratitude was genuine--a payment for a lesson he would never need again. but 
even the editor knew there was something very wrong in that short "thanks," and very 
frightening. he did not know that it had been an obituary on gail wynand.

wynand walked back to the gazette, feeling no anger toward the editor or the political 
machine. he felt only a furious contempt for himself, for pat mulligan, for all integrity; he felt 
shame when he thought of those whose victims he and mulligan had been willing to become. 
he did not think "victims"--he thought "suckers." he got back to the office and wrote a brilliant 
editorial blasting captain mulligan. "why, i thought you kinda felt sorry for the poor bastard," 
said his editor, pleas

ed. "i don't feel sorry for anyone," said wynand.

grocers and deck hands had not appreciated gail wynand; politicians did. in his years on the 
paper he had learned how to get along with people. his face had assumed the expression it 
was to wear for the rest of his life: not quite a smile, but a motionless look of irony directed at 
the whole world. people could presume that his mockery was intended for the particular things 
they wished to mock. besides, it was pleasant to deal with a man untroubled by passion or 

sanctity.

he was twenty-three when a rival political gang, intent on winning a

municipal election and 
needing a newspaper to plug a certain issue, bought the gazette. they bought it in the name 
of gail wynand, who was to serve as a respectable front for the machine. gail wynand 
became editor-in-chief. he plugged the issue, he won the election for his bosses. two years 
later, he smashed the gang, sent its leaders to the penitentiary, and remained as sole owner 
of the gazette.

his first act was to tear down the sign over the door of the building and to throw out the 
paper's old masthead. the gazette became the new york banner. his friends objected. 
"publishers don't change the name of a paper," they told him. "this one does," he said.

the first campaign of the ba

at invention; the other about a 
chambermaid, the sweetheart of an executed murderer, awaiting the birth of her illegitimate 
child. one story was illustrated with scientific diagrams; the other--with the picture of a loose-
mouthed girl wearing a tragic expression and disarranged clothes. the banner asked its 
readers to help both these unfortunates. it received nine dollars and forty-five cents for the 
young scientist; it received one thousand and seventy-seven dollars for the unwed mother. 
gail wynand called a meeting of his staff. he put down on the table the paper carrying both 
stories and the money collected for both funds. "is there anyone here who doesn't 
understand?" he asked. no one answered. he said: "now you all know the kind of paper the 
banner is to be."

the publishers of his time took pride in stamping their individual personalities upon their 
newspapers. gail wynand delivered his paper, body and soul, to the mob. the banner 
assumed the appearance of a circus poster in body

, of a circus performance in soul. it 
accepted the same goal--to stun, to amuse and to collect admission. it bore the imprint, not of 
one, but of a million men. "men differ in their virtues, if any," said gail wynand, explaining his 
policy, "but they are alike in their vices." he added, looking straight into the questioner's eyes: 
"i am serving that which exists on this earth in greatest quantity. i am representing the 
majority--surely an act of virtue?"

the public asked for crime, scandal and sentiment. gail wynand provided it. he gave people 
what they wanted, plus a justification for indulging the tastes of which they had been 
ashamed. the banner presented murder, arson, rape, corruption--with an ap

le 
sneer. this gave the man on the street two satisfactions: that of entering illustrious drawing 
rooms and that of not wiping his feet on the threshold. the banner was permitted to strain 
truth, taste and credibility, but not its readers' brain power. its enormous headlines, glaring 
pictures and oversimplified text hit the senses and entered men's consciousness without any 
necessity for an intermediary process of reason, like food shot through the rectum, requiring 
no digestion.

"news," gail wynand told his staff, "is that which will create the greatest excitement among 
the greatest number. the thing that will knock them silly. the sillier the better, provided there's 
enough of them."

one day he brought into the office a man he had picked off the street. it was an ordinary man, 
neither well-dressed nor shabby, neither tall nor short, neither dark nor quite blond; he had the 
kind of face one could not remember even while looking at it. he was frightening by being so

ntiated; he lacked even the positive distinction of a half-wit. wynand took him 

through the building, introduced him to every member of the staff and let him go. then 
wynand called his staff together and told them: "when in doubt about your work, remember 
that man's face. you're writing for him."

"but, mr. wynand," said a young editor, "one can't remember his face."

"that's the point," said wynand.

when the name of gail wynand became a threat in the publishing world, a group of 
newspaper owners took him aside--at a city charity affair which all had to attend--and 
reproached him for what they called his debasement of the public taste. "it is not my 
function," said wynand, "to help people preserve a self-respect they haven't got. you give 
them what they profess to like in public. i give them what they really like. honesty is the best 
policy, gentlemen, though not quite in the sense you were taught to believe."

a fire broke out in a sweatshop employing thirty young girls. two of them perished in the 
disaster. mary watson, one of the survivors, gave the banner an exclusive story about the 
exploitation they had suffered. it led to a crusade against sweatshops, headed by the best 
women of the city. the origin of the fire was never discovered. it was whispered that mary 
watson had once been evelyn drake who wrote for the banner. it could not be proved.

in the first years of the banner's existence gail wynand spent more nights on his office couch 
than in his bedroom. the effort he demanded of his employees was hard to perform; the effort 
he demanded of himself was hard to believe. he drove them like an army; he drove himself 
like a slave. he paid them well; he got nothing but his rent and meals. he lived in a furnished 
room at the time when his best reporters lived in suites at expensive hotels. he spent money 
faster than it came in--and he spent it all on the banner. the paper was like a luxur

great many activities, not publicized, helped to build his fortune. he had forgotten nothing of 
his childhood. he remembered the things he had thought, standing as a bootblack at the rail 
of a ferryboat--the chances offered by a growing city. he bought real estate where no one 
expected it to become valuable, he built against all advice--and he ran hundreds into 
thousands. he bought his way into a great many enterprises of all kinds. sometimes they 
crashed, ruining everybody concerned, save gail wynand. he staged a crusade against a 
shady streetcar monopoly and caused it to lose its franchise; the franchise was granted to a 
shadier group, controlled by gail wynand. he exposed a vicious attempt to corner the beef 
market in the middle west--and left the field clear for another gang, operating under his 
orders.

he was helped by a great many people who discovered that young wynand was a bright 
fellow, worth using. he exhibited a charming complaisance about being used. in each case,

gail wynand.

sometimes he lost money on his investments, coldly and with full intention. through a series 
of untraceable steps he ruined many powerful men: the president of a bank, the head of an 
insurance company, the owner of a steamship line, and others. no one could discover his 
motives. the men were not his competitors and he gained nothing from their destruction.

"whatever that bastard wynand is after," people said, "it's not after money."

wynand's thin lips smiled. "you can't escape human depravity, kid," he said gently. "the boss 
you work for may have ideals, but he has to beg money and take orders from many 
contemptible people. i have no ideals--but i don't beg. take your choice. there's no other." 
the boy went back to his paper. a year later he came to wynand and asked if his offer were 
still open. wynand said that it was. the boy had remained on the banner ever since. he was 
the only one on the staff who loved gail wynand.

alvah scarret, sole survivor of the original gazette, had risen with wynand. but one could not 
say that he loved wynand--he merely clung to his boss with the automatic devotion of a rug 
under wynand's feet. alvah scarret had never hated anything, and so was incapable of love. 
he was shrewd, competent and unscrupulous in the innocent manner of one unable to grasp 
the conception of a scruple. he believed everything he wrote and everything written in the

barometer of public reaction.

no one could say whether gail wynand had a private life. his hours away from the office had 
assumed the style of the banner's front page--but a style raised to a grand plane, as if he 
were still playing circus, only to a gallery of kings. he bought out the entire house for a great 
opera performance--and sat alone in the empty auditorium with his current mistress. he 

discovered a beautiful play by an unknown playwright and paid him a huge sum to have the 
play performed once and never again; wynand was the sole spectator at t

mount she dared to fill in was less than he would have 
given otherwise. he bought some kind of balkan throne for a penniless pretender whom he 
met in a speakeasy and never bothered to see afterward; he often referred to "my valet, my 
chauffeur and my king."

at night, dressed in a shabby suit bought for nine dollars, wynand would often ride the 
subways and wander through the dives of slum districts, listening to his public. once, in a 
basement beer joint, he heard a truck driver denouncing gail wynand as the worst exponent 
of capitalistic evils, in a language of colorful accuracy. wynand agreed with him and helped 
him out with a few expressions of his own, from his hell's kitchen vocabulary. then wynand 
picked up a copy of the banner left by someone on a table, tore his own photograph from 
page 3, clipped it to a hundred-dollar bill, handed it to the truck driver and walked out before 
anyone could utter a word.

the succession of his mistresses was so rapid that it ceased to be gossip.

t wistfully. "no," said wynand. "but why, gail?"

"look, alvah. every man on earth has a soul of his own that nobody can stare at. even the 
convicts in a penitentiary and the freaks in a side show. everybody but me. my soul is spread 
in your sunday scandal sheet--in three-color process. so i must have a substitute--even if it's 
only a locked room and a few objects not to be pawed."

it was a long process and there had been premonitory signs, but scarret did not notice a 
certain new trait in gail wynand's character until wynand was forty-five. then it became 
apparent to many. wynand lost interest in breaking industrialists and financiers. he found a 
new kind of victim. people could not tell whether it was a sport, a mania or a systematic 
pursuit. they thought it was horrible, because it seemed so vicious and pointless.

it began with the case of dwight carson. dwight carson was a talented young writer who had 
achieved the spotless reputation of a man passionately devoted to his convictions

 was in him. if 
lightning strikes a rotten tree and it collapses, it's not the fault of the lightning."

"but what do you call a healthy tree?"

"they don't exist, alvah," said wynand cheerfully, "they don't exist."

alvah scarret never asked wynand for an explanation of this new pursuit. by some dim 
instinct scarret guessed a little of the reason behind it. scarret shrugged and laughed, telling 
people that it was nothing to worry about, it was just "a safety valve." only two men 
understood gail wynand: alvah scarret--partially; ellsworth toohey--completely.

ellsworth toohey--who wished, above all, to avoid a quarrel with wynand at that time--could 
not refrain from a feeling of resentment, because wynand had not chosen him as a victim. he 
almost wished wynand would try to corrupt him, no matter what the consequences. but 
wynand seldom noticed his existence.

wynand had never been afraid of death. through the years the thought of suicide had 
occurred to him, not as an intention, but as on

e of the many possibilities among the chances 
of life. he examined it indifferently, with polite curiosity, as he examined any possibility--and 
then forgot it. he had known moments of blank exhaustion when his will deserted him. he had 
always cured himself by a few hours in his art gallery.

thus he reached the age of fifty-one, and a day when nothing of consequence happened to 
him, yet the evening found him without desire to take a step farther.

gail wynand sat on the edge of the bed, slumped forward, his elbows on his knees, the gun 

on the palm of his hand.

yes, he told himself, there's an answer there somewhere. but i don't want to know it. i don't 
want to know it.

and because he felt a pang of dread at the root of this desire not to examine his life further, he 
knew that he would not die tonight. as long as he still feared something, he had a foothold on 
living; even if it meant only moving forward to an unknown disaster. the thought of

hint at some sort of blackmail; so many people had tried to blackmail him so unsuccessfully; 
he did think toohey would have more sense than that.

by the time he finished his drink, he had found no plausible explanation for the crate. it 
annoyed him, like a stubborn crossword puzzle. he had a kit of tools somewhere in a drawer 
of his desk. he found it and broke the crate open.

it was steven mallory's statue of dominique francon. gail wynand walked to his desk and put 
down the pliers he held as if they were of fragile crystal. then he turned and looked at the 
statue again. he stood looking at it for an hour. then he went to the telephone and dialed 
toohey's number. "hello?" said toohey's voice, its hoarse impatience confessing that he had 
been awakened out of sound sleep. "all right. come over," said wynand and hung up. toohey 
arrived half an hour later. it was his first visit to wynand's home. wynand himself answered

"just a practical suggestion," said toohey. "who has been your most effective salesman in

"why--dominique i guess."

"that's right. and since you can't get to wynand and it wouldn't do you any good if you did, 
don't you think dominique is the one who'll be able to persuade him?" keating stared at him. 
"are you crazy, ellsworth?" dominique leaned forward. she seemed interested.

"from what i've heard," she said, "gail wynand does not do favors for a woman, unless she's 
beautiful. and if she's beautiful, he doesn't do it as a favor."

toohey looked at her, underscoring the fact that he offered no denial.

"it's silly," snapped keating angrily. "how would dominique ever get to see him?"

"by telephoning his office and making an appointment," said toohey.

"who ever told you he'd grant it?"

"he did."

"when?!"

"late last night. or early this morning, to be exact."

"but the other fifty percent, ellsworth? a failure?"

"well, you're frank."

"i told you once it's the only method that will work with you. besides, surely it didn't take you 
two years to discover what i wanted of that marriage?"

"so you think gail wynand will finish the job?"

"might. what do you think?"

"i think i'm only a side issue again. didn't you call it 'gravy' once? what have you got against 
wynand?"

he laughed; the sound betrayed that he had not expected the question. she said 
contemptuously: "don't show that you're shocked, ellsworth."

commission he doesn't deserve for peter keating. see what will be left of you afterward. or of 
gail wynand. i'll be interested to see it, too."

"quite correct, ellsworth."

"all of it? even the part about a man you loved--if you did?"

"yes."

"you wouldn't sell yourself for roark? though, of course, you don't like to hear that name 
pronounced."

"howard roark," she said evenly.

"you have a great deal of courage, dominique."

keating returned, carrying a tray of cocktails. his eyes were feverish and he made too many 
gestures.

gail wynand rose and met her halfway across his office.

"how do you do, mrs. keating," he said.

"how do you do, mr. wynand," said dominique.

he moved a chair for her, but when she sat down he did not cross to sit behind his desk, he 
stood studying her professionally, appraisingly. his manner implied a self-evident necessity, 
as if his reason were known to her and there could be nothing improper in this behavior.

"you look like a stylized version of your own stylized version," he said. "as a rule seei

to you for giving me a much better motive than any i could hope to find."

"i'm glad you didn't say that you've always admired the work of peter keating."

"you didn't tell me how glad you were to join the distinguished list of gail wynand's 
mistresses."

"you may enjoy my admitting it, if you wish, but i think we'll get along very well together."

"quite likely. at least, you've given me a new experience: to do what i've always done--but 
honestly. shall i now begin to give you my orders? i won't pretend they're anything else."

"if you wish."

a few days later, meeting toohey by chance in the city room, wynand asked

"you flatter your fellow men," said wynand, walking away.

peter keating stared at the brilliant room of the restaurant. it was the most exclusive place in 
town, and the most expensive. keating gloated, chewing the thought that he was here as the 
guest of gail wynand.

he tried not to stare at the gracious elegance of wynand's figure across the table. he blessed 
wynand for having chosen to give this dinner in a public place. people were gaping at 
wynand--discreetly and with practiced camouflage, but gaping nevertheless--and their 
attention included the two guests at wynand's table.

dominique sat between the two men. she wore a white silk dress with long sleeves and a 
cowl neck, a nun's garment that acquired the startling effect of an evening gown only

the big shape rose to its feet--and keating recognized ralston holcombe hurrying toward 
them.

"peter, my boy, so glad to see you," boomed holcombe, shaking his hand, bowing to 
dominique, conspicuously ignoring wynand. "where have you been hiding? why don't we 
see you around any more?" they had had luncheon together three days ago.

wynand had risen and stood leaning forward a little, courteously. keating hesitated; then, with 
obvious reluctance, said:

"mr. wynand--mr. holcombe."

"not mr. gail wynand?" said holcombe with splendid innocence.

"mr. holcombe, if you saw one of the cough-drop smith brothers in real life, would you 
recognize him?" asked wynand.

"why--i guess so," said holcombe, blinking.

"my face, mr. holcombe, is just as much of a public bromide."

holcombe muttered a few benevolent generalities and escaped.

wynand smiled affectionately. "you didn't have to be afraid of introducing mr. holcombe to 
me, mr. keating, even though he is an architect."

"afraid, mr. wynand?"

"he'll tell you."

she slapped her gloves softly against her palm, a small gesture of finality, like a period at the 
end of a sentence. she turned to leave the room. he stood in her way.

"i don't care," he said. "i don't give a damn. i can play it your way. you're great, aren't you?--

"i think that's much better, peter. i'm glad." he found himself unable to preserve this attitude 
when he entered wynand's study that evening. he could not escape the awe of being 
admitted into gail wynand's home. by the time he crossed the room to

"he will," said toohey. "as soon as she returns."

scarret had been surprised that toohey should invite him to lunch, but the news he heard 
wiped out the surprise in a greater and more painful one.

"i'm fond of dominique," said scarret, pushing his plate aside, his appetite gone. "i've always 
been very fond of her. but to have her as mrs. gail wynand!"

"these, exactly, are my own sentiments," said toohey.

phenomena. you've been sitting on the edge of your seat for years-haven't you?-watching mr.

life of our boss. do i have to state the issue any plainer?"

"you're a smart man, ellsworth," said scarret heavily.

"that's been obvious for years."

"i'll talk to him. you'd better not-he hates your guts, if you'll excuse me. but i don't think i'd do 
much good either. not if he's made up his mind."

armchair in the study of wynand's penthouse that evening. "you know that. i'm thinking of 
nothing else."

wynand lay stretched out on a couch, one leg bent, with the foot resting on the knee of the 
other. he smoked and listened silently.

"i've known dominique for years," said scarret. "long before you ever heard of her. i love her. 
i love her, you might say, like a father. but you've got to admit that she's not the kind of 
woman your public would expect to see as mrs. gail wynand."

wynand said nothing.

"your wife is a public figure, gail. just automatically. a public property. your readers have a 
right to demand and expect certain things of her. a symbol value, if you know what i mean. 
like the queen of england, sort of. how do you expect dominique to live up to that? how do

up.

"i know, gail!" he cried happily. "i know what we can do. we'll put dominique back on the 
paper and we'll have her write a column--a different one--a syndicated column on the home. 
you know, household hints, kitchen, babies and all that. it'll take the curse off. show what a 
good little homebody she really is, her youthful mistakes notwithstanding. make the women 
forgive her. we'll have a special department--'mrs. gail wynand's recipes.' a few pictures of 
her will help--you know, gingham dresses and aprons and her hair done up in a more 
conventional way."

"shut up, alvah, before i slap your face," said wynand without raising his voice.

"yes, gail."

scarret made a move to get up.

"sit still. i haven't finished."

scarret waited obediently.

will tell them to look through their files and find any pictures of dominique francon

"yes."

"why?"

"you're still afraid of lunch wagons and windows."

"i'm not going back to new york. not at once."

"no?"

"you haven't asked me anything, roark. only whether i walked from the station."

"what do you want me to ask you?"

"i got off the train when i saw the name of the station," she said, her voice dull. "i didn't intend 
coming here. i was on my way to reno."

"and after that?"

"i will marry again."

"do i know your fiancé?"

"you've heard of him. his name is gail wynand."

she saw his eyes. she thought she should want to laugh; she had brought him at last to a 
shock she had never expected to achieve. but she did not laugh. he thought of henry 
cameron; of cameron saying: i have no answer to give them, howard. i'm leaving you to face 
them. you'll answer them. all of them, the wynand papers and what makes the wynand 
papers possible and what lies behind that.

"roark."

he didn't answer.

"that's worse than peter keating, isn't it?" she asked.

"much worse."

she sat up slowly, turning to face him. she did not withdraw her hand, but her fingers became 
rigid, conscious, taken away from him.

"no," she said.

she smiled and held the smile too long, in deliberate, fixed precision. he looked at her calmly.

"i want a real wedding, gail. i want it at the most ostentatious hotel in town. i want engraved 
invitations, guests, mobs of guests, celebrities, flowers, flash bulbs and newsreel cameras. i 
want the kind of wedding the public expects of gail wynand."

he released her fingers, simply, without resentment. he looked abstracted for a moment, as if 
he were calculating a problem in arithmetic, not too difficult. then he said:

"all right. that will take a week to arrange. i could have it done tonight, but if it's engraved 
invitations, we must give the guests a week's notice at the least. otherwise it would look 
abnormal and you want a normal gail wynand wedding. i'll have to take you to a hotel now, 
where you can live for a week. i had not

the background she had wished was set so perfectly that it became its own caricature, not a 
specific society wedding, but an impersonal prototype of lavish, exquisite vulgarity. he had 
understood her wish and obeyed scrupulously; he had refused himself the relief of 
exaggeration, he had not staged the event crudely, but made it beautiful in the exact manner 
gail wynand, the publisher, would have chosen had he wished to be married in public. but 
gail wynand did not wish to be married in public.

he made himself fit the setting, as if he were part of the bargain, subject to the same style.

solemn climax of his life. he looked correct, incomparably distinguished.

broke it at once. she made him accept invitations and she invited guests to their house. he

sally brent decided to outwit her boss. sally brent was one of the proudest possessions of the 
banner, a stout, middle-aged woman who dressed like a model for a style show of the twenty-
first century and wrote like a chambermaid. she had a large personal following among the 
readers of the banner. her popularity made her overconfident.

sally brent decided to do a story on mrs. gail wynand. it was just her type of story and there it 
was, simply going to waste. she gained admittance to wynand's penthouse, using the tactics 
of gaining admittance to places where one is not wanted which she had been taught as a well-
trained wynand employee. she made her usual dramatic entrance, wearing a black dress 
with a fresh sunflower on her shoulder--her constant ornament that had become a personal 
trade-mark--and she said to dominique breathlessly: "mrs. wynand, i've come here to help 
you

when i can't fire anyone i wish on my paper, i'll close it and blow up the god-damn building," 
said wynand calmly.

"but her public! we'll lose her public!"

"to hell with her public."

that night, at dinner, wynand took from his pocket a crumpled wad of paper--the proof cut of 
the story--and threw it, without a word, at dominique's face across the table. it hit her cheek 
and fell to the floor. she picked it up, unrolled it, saw what it was and laughed aloud.

sally brent wrote an article on gail wynand's love life. in a gay, intellectual manner, in the 
terms of sociological study, the article presented material such as no pulp magazine would 
have accepted. it was published in the new frontiers.

railing, risking deliberately the danger of a 
sudden break, gaining a new propulsion. he was not the corrupt publisher of a popular 
empire. he was an aristocrat aboard a yacht. he looked, she thought, like what one believes 
aristocracy to be when one is young: a brilliant kind of gaiety without guilt.

she looked at him in the deck chair. she thought that relaxation was attractive only in those 
for whom it was an unnatural state; then even limpness acquired purpose. she wondered 
about him; gail wynand, famous for his extraordinary capacity; but this was not merely the 
force of an ambitious adventurer who had created a chain of newspapers; this--the quality she 
saw in him here--the thing stretched out under the sun like an answer--this was greater, a first 
cause, a faculty out of universal dynamics.

"gail," she said suddenly, involuntarily.

he opened his eyes to look at her.

"i wish i had taken a recording of that," he said lazily. "you'd be startled to hear what it 
sounded like. quite

"i'll repeat it there, if you wish."

"thank you, dearest. and i promise not to exaggerate or presume too much. you're not in love
with me. you've never loved anyone."

"why do you think that?"

"if you loved a man, it wouldn't be just a matter of a circus wedding and an atrocious evening 
in the theater. you'd put him through total hell."

"how do you know that, gail?"

"why have you been staring at me ever since we met? because i'm not the gail wynand 
you'd heard about. you see, i love you. and love is exception-making. if you were in love you'd 
want to be broken, trampled, ordered, dominated, because that's the impossible, the 
inconceivable for you in your relations with people. that would be the one gift, the great 
exception you'd want to offer the man you loved. but it wouldn't be easy for you."

"if that's true, then you..."

"then i become gentle and humble--to your great astonishment--because i'm the worst 
scoundrel living."

"that's where i was born. hell's kitchen." she listened attentively; he seldom spoke of his 
beginning. "i was sixteen when i stood on a roof and looked at the city, like tonight. and 
decided what i would be."

the quality of his voice became a line underscoring the moment, saying: take notice, this is 
important. not looking at him, she thought this was what he had waited for, this should give 
her the answer, the key to him. years ago, thinking of gail wynand, she had wondered how 
such a man faced his life and his work; she expected boasting and a hidden sense of shame, 
or impertinence flaunting its own guilt. she looked at him. his head lifted, his eyes level on the 
sky before him, he conveyed none of the things she had expected; he conveyed a quality 
incredible in this connection: a sense of gallantry.

knew the use of that key and made her speak.

st the wall beside her. he looked at her hands, at her naked shoulders, but 
she felt as if he did not see her; he was looking at something greater than the beauty of her 
body, greater than his love for her; he was looking at himself--and this, she knew, was the one 
incomparable tribute.

"i breathe for my own necessity, for the fuel of my body, for my survival...i've given you, not 
my sacrifice or my pity, but my ego and my naked need..." she heard roark's words, roark's 
voice speaking for gail wynand--and she felt no sense of treason to roark in using the words 
of his love for the love of another man.

"gail," she said gently, "some day i'll have to ask your forgiveness for having married you."

he shook his head slowly, smiling. she said:

"i wanted you to be my chain to the world. you've become my defense, instead. and that 
makes my marriage dishonest."

"no. i told you i would accept any reason you chose."

saw mallory's eyes, intent and shocked. mallory realized that his words had hurt roark, hurt 
him enough to force this admission. but roark turned to him and said deliberately:

"dominique used to think just as you do."

mallory had never spoken of what he guessed about roark's past. their silence had always 
implied that mallory understood, that roark knew it, and that it was not to be discussed. but 
now mallory asked:

"are you still waiting for her to come back? mrs. gail wynand--god damn her!"

roark said without emphasis:

"shut up, steve."

mallory whispered: "i'm sorry."

roark walked to his table and said, his voice normal again:

"go home, steve, and forget about bradley. they'll all be suing one another now, but we won't 
be dragged in and they won't destroy monadnock. forget it, and get out, i have to work."

he brushed the newspaper off the table, with his elbow, and bent over the sheets of drafting

n of november, returning to his office after a visit to the site of a house under 
construction on long island, roark entered the reception room, shaking his drenched 
raincoat, and saw a look of suppressed excitement on the face of his secretary; she had been 
waiting impatiently for his return.

"mr. roark, this is probably something very big," she said. "i made an appointment for you for 
three o'clock tomorrow afternoon. at his office."

"whose office?"

"he telephoned half an hour ago. mr. gail wynand."

a sign hung over the entrance door, a reproduction of the paper's masthead:

the sign was small, a statement of fame and power that needed no emphasis; it was like a 
fine, mocking smile that justified the building's bare ugliness; the building was a factory 
scornful of all ornament save the implications of that masthead.

the entrance lobby looked like the mouth of a furnace; elevators drew a stream of human fuel 
and spat it out. the men did not hurry, but the

authority aware of every motion, as if the building were flowing with channeled energy, 
functioning smoothly, soundlessly, a magnificent machine that nothing could destroy. nobody 
paid any attention to the redheaded man who stopped in the lobby for a moment.

howard roark looked up at the tiled vault. he had never hated anyone. somewhere in this 
building was its owner, the man who had made him feel his nearest approach to hatred.

gail wynand glanced at the small clock on his desk. in a few minutes he had an appointment 
with an architect. the interview, he thought, would not be difficult; he had held many such 
interviews in his life; he merely had to speak, he knew what he wanted to say, and nothing 
was required of the architect except a few sounds signifying understanding.

his glance went from the clock back to the sheets of proofs on his desk. he read an editorial 
by alvah scarret on the public feeding of squirrels in central

looking at the man behind the desk; perhaps there had been no break in his steps and it only 
seemed to him that he had stopped. but there had been a moment when both forgot the terms
of immediate reality, when wynand forgot his purpose in summoning this man, when roark 
forgot that this man was dominique's husband, when no door, desk or stretch of carpet 
existed, only the total awareness, for each, of the man before him, only two thoughts meeting 
in the middle of the room--"this is gail wynand"--"this is howard roark."

then wynand rose, his hand motioned in simple invitation to the chair beside his desk, roark 
approached and sat down, and they did not notice that they had not greeted each other.

wynand smiled, and said what he had never intended to say. he said very simply:

"i don't think you'll want to work for me."

"i want to work for you," said roark, who had come here prepared to refuse.

"have you seen the kind of things i've built?"

"yes."

wynand smiled. "this is differe

"thank you. i'll make up for it. you may consider the wynand papers as your personal press

"i don't want any plugging."

wynand laughed aloud. "what a thing to say in what a place! i don't think you have any idea 
how your fellow architects would have conducted this interview. i don't believe you were 

actually conscious at any time that you were speaking to gail wynand."

"i was," said roark.

"this was my way of thanking you. i don't always like being gail wynand."

"i know that."

"i'm going to change my mind and ask you a personal question. you said you'd answer 
anything."

"i will."

"have you always liked being howard roark?"

roark smiled. the smile was amused, astonished, involuntarily contemptuous.

"you've answered," said wynand.

then he rose and said: "nine o'clock tomorrow morning," extending his hand.

when roark had gone, wynand sat behind his

"then you think it'll work that way?"

"it might. or it might be much worse than anything you imagine. but it's of no importance to us 
any more. because you see, alvah, as far as the banner is concerned, if it came to a

when the boy from the morgue entered, carrying a thick envelope of clippings, wynand 
looked up from his desk and said:

"that much? i didn't know he was so famous."

"well, it's the stoddard trial, mr. wynand."

the boy stopped. there was nothing wrong--only the ridges on wynand's forehead, and he 
did not know wynand well enough to know what these meant. he wondered what made him 
feel as if he should be afraid. after a moment, wynand said:

"all right. thank you."

in all the gossip about gail wynand, no one had ever mentioned the expression of his face as 
it was in this moment. the few men who had seen it did not talk about it. of these men, 
dwight carson had been the first. wynand's lips were parted, his eyes brilliant. it was an 
expression of sensual pleasure derived from agony--the agony of his victim or his own, or 
both.

she stopped, her hands behind her, palms flattened against the doorjamb. she was too far 
away to see the signature, but she knew the work and the only man who could have designed

her shoulders moved, describing a circle, twisting slowly, as if she were tied to a pole, had 
abandoned hope of escape, and only her body made a last, instinctive gesture of protest.

she thought, were she lying in bed in roark's arms in the sight of gail wynand, the violation 
would be less terrible; this drawing, more personal than roark's body, created in answer to a 
matching force that came from gail wynand, was a violation of her, of roark, of wynand--and 
yet, she knew suddenly that it was the inevitable.

"no," she whispered, "things like that are never a coincidence."

she moved her hand, tracing a spiral on the arm of the davenport, to convince herself that she 
could.

"here?"

"yes."

"you've asked him for dinner?"

he smiled; he remembered his resentment against the presence of guests in their house. he 
said: "this is different. i want him here. i don't think you remember him well--or you wouldn't 
be astonished."

she got up.

"all right, gail. i'll give the orders. then i'll get dressed."

they faced each other across the drawing room of gail wynand's penthouse. she thought 
how simple it was. he had always been here. he had been the motive power of every step she
had taken in these rooms. he had brought her here and now he had come to claim this place. 
she was looking at him. she was seeing him as she had seen him on the morning when she 
awakened in his bed for the last time. she knew that neither his clothes nor the years stood 
between her and the living intactness of that memory. she thought this had been inevitable 
from the first,

from the instant when she had looked down at him on the ledge of a quarry--it 
had to come like this, in gail wynand's house--and now she felt the peace of finality, knowing 
that her share of decision had ended; she had been the one who acted, but he would act from 
now on.

she stood straight, her head level; the planes of her face had a military cleanliness of 
precision and a feminine fragility; her hands hung still, composed by her sides, parallel with 
the long straight lines of her black dress.

"how do you do, mr. roark."

"how do you do, mrs. wynand."

dinner was announced and she rose obediently; she led the way to the dining room, like a 
graceful animal given poise by conditioned reflexes. she sat at the head of the table, between 
the two men facing each other at her sides. she watched the silverware in roark's fingers, the 
pieces of polished metal with the initials "d w." she thought: i have done this so many times--i 
am the gracious mrs. gail wynand--there were senators, judges, presidents of insurance 
companies, sitting at dinner in that place at my right--and this is what i was being trained for, 

this is why gail has been rising through tortured years to the position of entertaining senators 
and judges at dinner--for the purpose of reaching an evening when the guest facing him would 
be howard roark.

wynand spoke about the newspaper business; he showed no reluctance to discuss it with 
roark, and she pronounced a few sentences when

she felt something angry and dangerous, like a single, sudden twist within her, and she said, 
half in fear, half in deliberate invitation:

"doesn't he remind you of dwight carson?"

"oh, forget dwight carson!"

wynand's voice, refusing earnestness, refusing guilt, had sounded exactly like the voice that 
had said: "forget the stoddard temple."
#

the secretary in the reception room looked, startled, at the patrician gentleman whose face 
she had seen so often in the papers.

"gail wynand," he said, inclining his head in self-introduction. "i should like to see mr. roark. 
if he is not busy. please do not disturb him if he is. i had no appointment."

she had never expected wynand to come to an office unannounced and to ask admittance in 
that tone of grave deference.

she announced the visitor. roark came out into the reception room, smiling, as if he found 
nothing unusual in this call.

"hello, gail. come in."

she could not go. her share of action was ended. he would come to her when he wished. she 
knew he would come, and that he wanted her to wait. she had waited, but she had held on to 
one thought--of an address, an office in the cord building.

she stood, her hand closed over the stem of the telephone receiver. she had no right to go to 
that office. but gail wynand had.

when ellsworth toohey entered wynand's office, as summoned, he made a few steps, then 
stopped. the walls of wynand's office--the only luxurious room in the banner building--were 
made of cork and copper paneling and had never borne any pictures. now, on the wall facing 
wynand's desk, he saw an enlarged photograph under glass: the picture of roark at the 
opening of the enright house; roark standing at the parapet of the river, his head thrown 
back.

entirely. not a word, mr. toohey. not ever again. now don't mention your contract or any 
particular clause of it. it would not be advisable. go on writing your column, but remember its 

title and devote it to commensurate subjects. keep it small, mr. toohey. very small."

"yes, mr. wynand," said toohey easily. "i don't have to write about mr. roark at present."

"that's all."

toohey rose. "yes, mr. wynand."

gail wynand sat at his desk in his office and read the proofs of an editorial on the moral 
value of raising large families. sentences like used chewing gum, chewed and rechewed, spat 
out and picked up again, passing from mouth to mouth to pavement to shoe sole to mouth to 
brain....he thought of howard roark and went on reading the banner; it made things easier.

sper. he heard three statements 
in his mind, in precise succession, like interlocking gears: it's spring--i wonder if i have many 
left to see--i am fifty-five years old.

they were statements, not emotions; he felt nothing, neither eagerness nor fear. but he knew 
it was strange that he should experience a sense of time; he had never thought of his age in 
relation to any measure, he had never defined his position on a limited course, he had not 
thought of a course nor of limits. he had been gail wynand and he had stood still, like this 
car, and the years had sped past him, like this earth, and the motor within him had controlled 
the flight of the years.

no, he thought, i regret nothing. there have been things i missed, but i ask no questions, 
because i have loved it, such as it has been, even the moments of emptiness, even the 
unanswered--and that i loved it, that is the unanswered in my life. but i loved it.

if it were true, that old legend about appearing before a supreme judge and na

 all my pride, not any act i committed, but one thing i have never 

done on this earth: that i never sought an outside sanction. i would stand and say: i am gail 
wynand, the man who has committed every crime except the foremost one: that of ascribing 
futility to the wonderful fact of existence and seeking justification beyond myself. this is my 
pride: that now, thinking of the end, i do not cry like all the men of my age: but what was the 
use and the meaning? i was the use and meaning, i, gail wynand. that i lived and that i 
acted.

he drove to the foot of the hill and slammed the brakes on, startled, looking up. in his absence 
the house had taken shape; it could be recognized now--it looked like the drawing. he felt a 
moment of childish wonder that it had really come out just as on the sketch, as if he had never 
quite believed it. rising against the pale blue sky, it still looked like a drawing, unfinished, the 
planes of masonry like spreads of watercolor filled in, the naked scaffold

sreels in theaters. i don't think it's a large group, 
but...last week an unappetizing female threw a fit in my store--the one on fifty avenue--
calling us enemies of labor because we advertised in the banner. you can ignore that, but it 
becomes serious when one of our oldest customers, a mild little old lady from connecticut and 
a republican for three generations, calls us to say that perhaps maybe she should cancel her 
charge account, because somebody told her that wynand is a dictator."

"gail wynand knows nothing about politics except of the most primitive kind," said toohey. 
"he still thinks in terms of the democratic club of hell's kitchen. there was a certain 
innocence about the political corruption of those days, don't you think so?"

"i don't care. that's not what i'm talking about. i mean, the banner is becoming a kind of 
liability. it hurts business. one's got to be so careful nowadays. you get tied up with the wrong 
people and first thing you know there's a smear campaign going

i can't afford that sort of thing."

"it's not entirely an unjustified smear."

"i don't care. i don't give a damn whether it's true or not. who am i to stick my neck out for 
gail wynand? if there's a public sentiment against him, my job is to get as far away as i can, 
pronto. and i'm not the only one. there's a bunch of us who're thinking the same. jim ferris 
of ferris & symes, billy shultz of vimo flakes, bud harper of toddler togs, and...hell, you 
know them all, they're all your friends, our bunch, the liberal businessmen. we all want to yank 
our ads out of the banner."

nobody understands what a terrible handicap it is to be born rich. because people just take

nobody said a word. they heard the rising inflection of hysteria in mitchell layton's voice. eve 
layton looked at toohey, silently appealing for help. toohey smiled and made a step forward.

"i'm ashamed of you, mitch," he said.

layton's lower lip vanished.

"i'm ashamed of you, mitch," toohey repeated sternly, "for comparing yourself to a man as 
contemptible as gail wynand."

mitchell layton's mouth relaxed in the equivalent of something almost as gentle as a smile.

"that's true," he said humbly.

"no, you would never be able to match gail wynand's career. not with your sensitive spirit 
and humanitarian instincts. that's what's holding you down, mitch, not your money. who 
cares about money? the age of money is past. it's your nature that's too fine for the brute 
competition of our capitalistic system. but that, too, is passing."

"it's self-evident," said eve layton.

the city lay gravely empty around him, and the dark masses of the buildin

"you god-damn fool!" said gail wynand. "what are you up to?"

he threw to roark a copy of the banner, folded at an inside page. the page bore a 
photograph captioned: "architects' drawing of cortlandt homes, the $15,000,000 federal 
housing project to be built in astoria, l. i., keating & dumont, architects."

roark glanced at the photograph and asked: "what do you mean?"

"goodness, peter, you talk as if it had been sixty-five years ago."

"but so many things happened. i..." he took the plunge; he had to take it; the crudest way 
seemed the easiest. "i was married. and divorced."

"yes, i read about that. i was glad when you were divorced." he leaned forward. "if your wife 
was the kind of woman who could marry gail wynand, you were lucky to get rid of her."

the tone of chronic impatience that ran words together had not altered to pronounce this. he 
had to believe it: this was all the subject meant to her.

gail wynand looked at the shining wood of the yacht deck. the wood and a brass 
doorknob that had become a smear of fire gave him a sense of everything around him: the 
miles of space filled with sun, between the burning spreads of sky and ocean. it was february, 
and the yacht lay still, her engines idle, in the southern pacific.

he leaned on the rail and looked down at roark in the water. roark floated on his back, his 
body stretched into a straight line, arms spread, eyes closed. the tan of his skin i

sense of surrender to roark in 
the knowledge that no conceivable force could make him exercise that power. every physical 
instrumentality was on his side: a few contractions of his vocal cords giving the order and 
someone's hand opening a valve--and the obedient machine would move away. he thought: 
it's not just a moral issue, not the mere horror of the act, one could conceivably abandon a 
man if the fate of a continent depended on it. but nothing would enable him to abandon this 
man. he, gail wynand, was the helpless one in this moment, with the solid planking of the 
deck under his feet. roark, floating like a piece of driftwood, held a power greater than that of 
the engine in the belly of the yacht. wynand thought: because that is the power from which 
the engine has come.

roark climbed back on deck; wynand looked at roark's body, at the threads of water running 
down the angular planes. he said:

"you made a mistake on the stoddard temple, howard. that statue should have been, not of

began to shake suddenly. "you bloody fools!" he said through his teeth and there followed 
every obscenity he had learned on the waterfront. he forgot all the aspects of the situation 
save one: roark being held behind bars. he was stretch wynand of hell's kitchen again and 
this was the kind of fury that had shattered him in sudden flashes in those days, the fury he

"yes. i knew that."

"i'm counting on you to save gail, if i go."

he looked at her and shook his head. "dearest..." it sounded

like a reproach.

"yes?" she whispered.

"don't you know by now that it was a trap i set for you?"

"how?"

"what would you do if i hadn't asked you to help me?"

"i'd be with you, in your apartment, at the enright house, right now, publicly and openly."

 of men such as howard roark."

thus spoke ellsworth m. toohey in the pages of the new frontiers.

echoes answered him from all over the country. the explosion of cortlandt had lasted half a 
minute. the explosion of public fury went on and on, with a cloud of powdered plaster filling 
the air, with rust and refuse raining out of the cloud.

roark had been indicted by a grand jury, had pleaded "not guilty" and had refused to make 
any other statement. he had been released on a bond furnished by gail wynand, and he 
awaited trial.

there were many speculations on his motive. some said it was professional jealousy. others 
declared that there was a certain similarity between the design of cortlandt and roark's style 
of building, that keating, prescott and webb might have borrowed a little from roark--"a 
legitimate adaptation"--"there's no property rights on ideas"--"in a democracy, art belongs to all 
the people"--and that roark had been prompted by the vengeance lust of an artist who had

red--the housewife buying 
carrots from a pushcart--the bookkeeper who had wanted to be a pianist, but had the excuse 
of a sister to support--the businessman who hated his business--the worker who hated his 
work--the intellectual who hated everybody--all were united as brothers in the luxury of 
common anger that cured boredom and took them out of themselves, and they knew well 
enough what a blessing it was to be taken out of themselves. the readers were unanimous. 
the press was unanimous.

gail wynand went against the current.

"gail!" alvah scarret had gasped. "we can't defend a dynamiter!"

"keep still, alvah," wynand had said, "before i bash your teeth in."

gail wynand stood alone in the middle of his office, his head thrown back, glad to be living, as 
he had stood on a wharf on a dark night facing the lights of a city.

"in the filthy howling now going on all around us," said an editorial in the banner, signed "gail 
wynand" in big letters, "nobody seems to remember that howard roark s

cause or consideration whatsoever. should we not, then, stop preaching dangerous and 
vicious nonsense? self-sacrifice? but it is precisely the self that cannot and must not be 
sacrificed. it is the unsacrificed self that we must respect in man above all."

this editorial was quoted in the new frontiers and in many newspapers, reprinted in a box 
under the heading: "look who's talking!"

gail wynand laughed. resistance fed him and made him stronger. this was a war, and he 
had not engaged in a real war for years, not since the time when he laid the foundations of his 
empire amid cries of protest from the whole profession. he was granted the impossible, the 
dream of every man: the chance and intensity of youth, to be used with the wisdom of 
experience. a new beginning and a climax, together. i have waited and lived, he thought, for 
this.

are."

he was greeted by silence, and his employees glanced at one another. alvah scarret mopped 
his forehead. but they obeyed.

the banner printed a picture of the enright house, with the caption: "is this the man you want 
to destroy?" a picture of wynand's home: "match this, if you can." a picture of monadnock 
valley: "is this the man who has contributed nothing to society?"

the banner ran roark's biography, under the byline of a writer nobody had ever heard of; it 
was written by gail wynand. the banner ran a series on famous trials in which innocent men 
had been convicted by the majority prejudice of the moment. the banner ran articles on man 
martyred by society: socrates, galileo, pasteur, the thinkers, the scientists, a long, heroic 
line--each a man who stood alone, the man who defied men.

"but, gail, for god's sake, gail, it was a housing project!" wailed alvah scarret.

wynand looked at him helplessly: "i suppose it's impossible to make you fools understand that 
that has

cost a private builder would have needed, the settlements built and 
abandoned, the horrible performance accepted, admired, forgiven, protected by the sacred 
cow of altruism. "hell is said to be paved with good intentions," said the banner. "could it be 
because we've never learned to distinguish what intentions constitute the good? is it not time 
to learn? never have there been so many good intentions so loudly proclaimed in the world. 
and look at it."

the banner editorials were written by gail wynand as he stood at a table in the composing 
room, written as always on a huge piece of print stock, with a blue pencil, in letters an inch 
high. he slammed the g w at the end, and the famous initials had never carried such an air of 
reckless pride.

dominique had recovered and returned to their country house. wynand drove home late in the 
evening. he brought roark along as often as he could. they sat together in the living room, 
with the windows open to the spring night. the dark stretches of

that stronghold of yellow journalism, vulgarity, corruption and muckraking, that organized insult

howard roark, and howard roark is their rightful hero. after a lifetime devoted to blasting the 
integrity of the press, it is only fit that gail wynand should now support a cruder fellow 
dynamiter."

"all this fancy talk going 'round," said gus webb in a public speech, "is a lot of bull. here's the

"we have it from an unimpeachable source," wrote a radical newspaper, "that cortlandt was 
only the first step in a gigantic plot to blow up every housing project, every public power plant, 
post office and schoolhouse in the u.s.a. the conspiracy is headed by gail wynand--as we 
can see--and by other bloated capitalists of his kind, including some of our biggest 
moneybags."

"too little attention has been paid to the feminine angle of this case," wrote sally brent in the 
new frontiers. "the part played by mrs. gail wynand is certainly highly dubious, to say the 
least. isn't it just the cutest coincidence that it was mrs. wynand who just so conveniently sent 
the watchman away at just the right time? and that her husband is now raising the roof to 
defend mr.

roark? if we weren't blinded by a stupid, senseless, old-fashioned sense of 
gallantry where a so-called beautiful woman is concerned, we wouldn't allow that part of the 
case to be hushed up. if we weren't overawed by mrs. wynand's social position and the so-
called prestige of her husband--who's making an utter fool of himself--we'd ask a few question 
about the story that she almost lost her life in the disaster. how do we know she did? doctors 
can be bought, just like anybody else, and mr. gail wynand is an expert in such matters. if we 
consider all this, we might well see the outlines of something that looks like a most revolting 
'design for living.'"

"the position taken by the wynand press," wrote a quiet, conservative newspaper, "is 
inexplicable and disgraceful."

the circulation of the banner dropped week by week, the speed accelerating in the descent, 
like an elevator out of control. stickers and buttons inscribed "we don't read wynand" grew 
on walls, subway posts, windshields and

 coat lapels. wynand newsreels were booed off the 
theater screens. the banner vanished from corner newsstands; the news vendors had to 
carry it, but they hid it under their counters and produced it grudgingly, only upon request. the 
ground had been prepared, the pillars eaten through long ago; the cortlandt case provided the 

final impact.

roark was almost forgotten in the storm of indignation against gail wynand. the angriest 
protests came from wynand's own public: from the women's clubs, the ministers, the 
mothers, the small shopkeepers. alvah scarret had to be kept away from the room where 
hampers of letters to the editor were being filled each day; he started by reading the letters--
and his friends on the staff undertook to prevent a repetition of the experience, fearing a 
stroke.

the staff of the banner worked in silence. there were no furtive glances, no whispered cuss 
words, no gossip in w

ashrooms any longer. a few men resigned. the rest worked on, slowly, 
heavily, in the manner of men with life belts buckled, waiting for the inevitable.

gail wynand noticed a kind of lingering tempo in every action around him. when he entered 
the banner building, his employees stopped at sight of him; when he nodded to them, their 
greeting came a second too late; when he walked on and turned, he found them staring after 
him. the "yes, mr. wynand," that had always answered his orders without a moment's cut 
between the last syllable of his voice and the first letter of the answer, now came late, and the 
pause had a tangible shape, so that the answer sou

"what did you do to lucius heyer?"

"i killed him."

roark, we must crush the forces of selfishness and antisocial individualism--the curse of our 
modern world--here shown to us in ultimate consequences. as mentioned at the beginning of 
this column, the district attorney now has in his possession a piece of evidence--we cannot 
disclose its nature at this moment--which proves conclusively that roark is guilty. we, the 
people, shall now demand justice."

this appeared in "one small voice" on a morning late in may. gail wynand read it in his car, 
driving home from the airport. he had flown to chicago in a last attempt to hold a national 
advertiser who had refused to renew a three-million-dollar contract. two days of skillful effort 
had failed; wynand lost the advertiser. stepping off the plane in newark, he picked up the 
new york papers. his car was waiting to take him to his country house. then he read "one 
small voice."

he wondered for a moment what paper he held. he looked at the name on the top of the

between skeet-shooting and breeding pheasants. his childless wife was a member of the

the two men off the copy desk were not members of toohey's union. alien's daughter was a

lancelot clokey.

gail wynand sat at the desk in his office and looked down at a pile of paper. he had many 
things to do, but one picture kept coming back to him and he could not get rid of it and the 
sense of it clung to all his actions--the picture of a ragged boy standing before the desk of an 
editor: "can you spell cat?"--"can you spell anthropomorphology?" the identities cracked and 
became mixed, it seemed to him that the boy stood here, at his desk, waiting, and once he 
said aloud: "go away!" he caught himself in

homer slottern, in the name of a group who called themselves the liberal businessmen, sent 
wynand a notice canceling their advertising contracts. "you may sue us if you wish. we feel 
we have a legitimate cause for cancellation. we signed to advertise in a reputable newspaper, 
not in a sheet that has become a public disgrace, brings pickets to our doors, ruins our 
business and is not being read by anybody." the group included most of the banner's 
wealthiest advertisers.

gail wynand stood at the window of his office and looked at his city.

"i have supported strikes at a time when it was dangerous to do so. i have fought gail 
wynand all my life. i had never expected to see the day or the issue when i would be forced to

chronicle.

gail wynand stood at a desk in the city room and wrote editorials as usual. his derelict staff 
saw no change in him; no haste, no outbursts of anger. there was nobody to notice that some 
of his actions were new: he would go to the pressroom and stand looking at the white stream 
shot out of the roaring giants, and listen to the sound. he would pick up a lead slug off the 
composing room floor, and finger it absently on the palm of his hand, like a piece of jade, and 
lay it carefully on a table, as if he

sky look fresh and the street dirty; there were patches of brown and tired orange in the 
corners of old buildings. he saw pickets pacing in front of the banner's entrance. there were 
eight of them and they marched around and around in a long oval on the sidewalk. he 
recognized one boy--a police reporter, he had never seen any of the others. they carried 
signs: "toohey, harding, alien, falk..." "the freedom of the press..." "gail wynand tramples 
human rights..."

his eyes kept following one woman. her hips began at her ankles, bulging over the tight 
straps of her shoes; she had square shoulders and a long coat of cheap brown tweed over a 
huge square body. she had small white hands, the kind that would drop things all over the 
kitchen. she had an incision of a mouth, without lips, and she waddled as she moved, but she 
moved with surprising briskness. her steps defied the whole world to hurt her, with a malicious

i could understand, i'd say fight the bastards for all we're worth. but what's this--a god-damn 
intellectual issue of some kind? are we losing our shirts for principles or something?"

"don't you understand? the banner's a church publication now. mr. gail wynand, the

"now if it were a real issue, a political issue--but some fool dynamiter who's blown up some

want my honest opinion, it's the lousiest stuff ever put in print. you'd think you were writing for

great liberal, just because..."

"i stand with mr. scarret," said the man who had spoken of senators, and the voices of the 
others seconded him, and the man who had criticized the editorials said suddenly, in the 
general noise: "i think gail wynand was a hell of a swell boss after all!" there was something 
about mitchell layton which he didn't want to see. now he looked at wynand, for protection. 
wynand did not notice him.

"gail?" asked scarret. "gail, what do you say?" there was no answer.

"god damn it, wynand, it's now or never! this can't go on!"

"make up your mind or get out!"

"i'll buy you out!" shrieked layton. "want to sell? want to sell and get the hell out of it?"

tags of love, together with soiled trousers, coffee pots, ash trays, pornographic plaster figures; 
the refuse of despair, pledged, not sold, not cut off in clean finality, but hocked to a stillborn 
hope, never to be redeemed. "hello, gail wynand," he said to the things in the window, and 
walked on.

he felt an iron grate under his feet and an odor struck him in the face, an odor of dust, sweat 
and dirty clothing, worse than the smell of stockyards, because it had a homey, normal quality, 
like decomposition made routine. the grating of a subway. he thought, this is the residue of

no air to breathe. this is the sum, even though down there, amo

when he looked up, he was in a brightly lighted street, on a trim sidewalk, looking at a wax 
figure exquisitely contorted on a satin chaise longue in a shop window; the figure wore a 
salmon-colored negligee, lucite sandals and a string of pearls suspended from one raised 
finger.

he did not know when he had dropped the paper. it was not in his hands any longer. he 
glanced back. it would be impossible to find a discarded paper lying on some street he did not 
know he had passed. he though

he stood in the middle of a street. he looked slowly down the mouth of every dark crevice, up 
the streaked walls, to the windows, to the roofs.

i never got out. i surrendered to the grocery man--to the deck hands on the ferryboat--to the

you've never run things anywhere, gail wynand. you've only added yourself to the things they 
ran.

then he looked up, across the city, to the shapes of the great skyscrapers. he saw a string of 
lights rising unsupported in black space, a glowing pinnacle anchored to nothing, a small, 
brilliant square hanging detached in the sky. he knew the famous buildings to which these 
belonged, he could reconstruct their forms in space. he thought, you're my judges and

water, and the energy of heat had been transformed into a sharper clarity, an added brilliance 
of outline for the buildings of the city. in the streets, scattered like scraps of gray foam, there 
were a great many copies of the banner. the city read, chuckling, the statement of wynand's 
renunciation.

"that's that," said gus webb, chairman of the "we don't read wynand" committee. "it's 
slick," said ike. "i'd like one peek, just one peek, at the great mr. gail wynand's face today," 
said sally brent. "it's about time," said homer slottern. "isn't it splendid? wynand's 
surrendered," said a tight-lipped woman; she knew little about wynand and nothing about the 
issue, but she liked to hear of people surrendering. in a kitchen, after dinner, a fat woman 
scraped the remnants off the dishes onto a sheet of newspaper; she never read the front 
page, only the installments of a love serial in the second section; she wrapped onion peelings 
and lamb-chop bones in

she felt as if the sunlight went straight through her, because her body had no weight.

but she had to hurry before he awakened. she found his pyjamas in a dresser drawer and put 
them on. she went to the living room, closing the door carefully behind her. she picked up the 
telephone and asked for the nearest sheriff's office.

"this is mrs. gail wynand," she said. "i am speaking from the house of mr. howard roark at 
monadnock valley. i wish to report that my star-sapphire ring was stolen here last 
night....about five thousand dollars....it was a present from mr. roark....can you get here 
within an hour?...thank you."

she went to the kitchen, made coffee and stood watching the glow of the electric coil under 
the coffee pot, thinking that it was the most beautiful light on earth.

she set the table by the large window in the living room. h

walked to open the door.

there were a sheriff, a deputy and two reporters from local papers.

"good morning," said dominique. "come in."

"mrs....wynand?" said the sheriff.

"that's right. mrs. gail wynand. come in. sit down."

in the ludicrous folds of the pyjamas, with dark cloth bulging over a belt wound tightly, with 
sleeves hanging over her fingertips, she had all the poised elegance she displayed in her best 
hostess gown. she was the only one who seemed to find nothing unusual in the situation.

the sheriff held a notebook as if he did not know what to do with it. she helped him to find the 
right questions and answered them precisely like a good newspaper woman.

wynand drove to his country house. dominique was there, waiting for him.

she stood up when he entered her room. she stepped forward, so that there would be no 
furniture between them; she wished him to see her whole body. he stood across the empty 
space and looked at her as if he were observing them both at once, an impartial spectator 
who saw dominique and a man facing her, but no gail wynand.

she waited, but he said nothing.

"well, i've given you a story that will build circulation, gail."

he had heard, but he looked as if nothing of the present were relevant. he looked like a bank 
teller balancing a stranger's account that had been overdrawn and had to be closed. he said:

"i would like only to know this, if you'll tell me: that was the first time since our marriage?"

skyscrapers stood like shafts of sunlight, washed white by distance and summer. a crowd 
filled the county courtroom, witnessing the trial of howard roark.

roark sat at the defense table. he listened calmly.

dominique sat in the third row of spectators. looking at her, people felt as if they had seen a 
smile. she did not smile. she looked at the leaves in the window.

gail wynand sat at the back of the courtroom. he had come in, alone, when the room was 
full. he had not noticed the stares and the flashbulbs exploding around him. he had stood in 
the aisle for a moment, surveying the place as if there were no reason why he should not

dominique was not present at the brief hearing. wynand stood like a man facing a court-

roark sat at the drafting table in his office, working. the city beyond the glass walls seemed 
lustrous, the air washed by the first cold of october.

the telephone rang. he held his pencil suspended in a jerk of impatience; the telephone was 
never to ring when he was drawing. he walked to his desk and picked up the receiver.

"mr. roark," said his secretary, the tense little note in her voice serving as apology for a 
broken order, "mr. gail wynand wishes to know whether it would be convenient for you to 
come to his office at four o'clock tomorrow afternoon?"

she heard the faint buzz of silence in the receiver at her ear and counted many seconds.

"is he on the wire?" asked roark. she knew it was not the phone connection that made his 
voice sound like that.

"no, mr. roark. it's mr. wynand's secretary."

"yes. yes. tell her yes."

he walked to the drafting table and looked down at the sketches; it was the first desertion he
