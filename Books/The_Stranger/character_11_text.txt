nd  shook  hands  with  the  journalists.  they  remained
laughing and chatting together, all seemingly very much at home here, until a bell
rang shrilly and everyone went to his place. my lawyer came up to me, shook hands,
and advised me to answer all the questions as briefly as possible, not to volunteer
information, and to rely on him to see me through.

i heard a chair scrape on my left, and a tall, thin man wearing pince-nez settled the
folds of his red gown as he took his seat. the public prosecutor, i gathered. a clerk
of the court announced that their honors were entering, and at the same moment two
big electric fans started buzzing overhead. three judges, two in black and the third in
scarlet, with brief cases under their arms, entered and walked briskly to the bench,
which was several feet above the level of the courtroom floor. the man in scarlet
took  the  central,  high-backed  chair,  placed  his  cap  of  office  on  the  table,  ran  a

table, was
gazing hard at me. he had a plain, rather chunky face; what held my attention were
his  eyes,  very  pale,  clear  eyes,  riveted  on  me,  though  not  betraying  any  definite
emotion. for a moment i had an odd impression, as if i were being scrutinized by
myself. that—and the fact that i was unfamiliar with court procedure—may explain
why i didn’t follow very well the opening phases: the drawing of lots for the jury, the
various questions put by the presiding judge  to  the  prosecutor,  the  foreman  of  the
jury,  and  my  counsel  (each  time  he  spoke  all  the  jurymen’s  heads  swung  round
together toward the bench), the hurried reading of the charge sheet, in the course of
which  i  recognized  some  familiar  names  of  people  and  places;  then  some
supplementary questions put to my lawyer.

next, the judge announced that the court would call over the witness list. some of
the names read out by the clerk rather surprised me. from amongst the crowd, which

estion was: why had i sent my mother to an institution?
i  replied  that  the  reason  was  simple;  i  hadn’t  enough  money  to  see  that  she  was
properly  looked  after  at  home.  then  he  asked  if  the  parting  hadn’t  caused  me
distress. i explained that neither mother nor i expected much of one another—or, for
that matter, of anybody else; so both of us had got used to the new conditions easily
enough. the judge then said that he had no wish to press the point, and asked the
prosecutor if he could think of any more questions that should be put to me at this
stage.

the prosecutor, who had his back half turned to me, said, without looking in my
direction, that, subject to his honor’s approval, he would like to know if i’d gone
back to the stream with the intention of killing the arab. i said, “no.” in that case,
why had i taken a revolver with me, and why go back precisely to that spot? i said it
was a matter of pure chance. the prosecutor then observed in a nasty tone

: “very
good. that will be all for the present.”

i couldn’t quite follow what came next. anyhow, after some palavering among the
bench, the prosecutor, and my counsel, the presiding judge announced that the court
would now rise; there was an adjournment till the afternoon, when evidence would
be taken.

almost  before  i  knew  what  was  happening  i  was  rushed  out  to  the  prison  van,
which  drove  me  back,  and  i  was  given  my  midday  meal.  after  a  short  time,  just
enough for me to realize how tired i was feeling, they came for me. i was back in the
same room, confronting the same faces, and the whole thing started again. bu

heat had meanwhile much increased, and by some miracle fans had been procured
for everyone: the jury, my lawyer, the prosecutor, and some of the journalists, too.
the young man and the robot woman were still at their places. but they were not
fanning themselves and, as before, they never took their eyes off me.

i wiped the sweat from my face, but i was barely conscious of where or who i was
until i heard the warden of the home called to the witness box. when asked if my

  mother’s  body,  or  shed  a  single  tear,  and  that  i’d  left
immediately  the  funeral  ended,  without  lingering  at  her  grave.  another  thing  had
surprised him. one of the undertaker’s men told him that i didn’t know my mother’s
age. there was a short silence; then the judge asked him if he might take it that he
was referring to the prisoner in the dock. the warden seemed puzzled by this, and the
judge explained: “it’s a formal question. i am bound to put it.”

the prosecutor was then asked if he had any questions to put, and he answered
loudly: “certainly not! i have all i want.” his tone and the look of triumph on his
face, as he glanced at me, were so marked that i felt as i hadn’t felt for ages. i had a
foolish desire to burst into tears. for the first time i’d realized how all these people
loathed me.

after asking the jury and my lawyer if they had any questions, the judge heard the
doorkeeper’s evidence. on stepping into the box the man threw a glan

looked away. replying to questions, he said that i’d declined to see mother’s body,
i’d smoked cigarettes and slept, and drunk café au lait. it was then i felt a sort of
wave  of  indignation  spreading  through  the  courtroom,  and  for  the  first  time  i
understood  that  i  was  guilty.  they  got  the  doorkeeper  to  repeat  what  he  had  said
about the coffee and my smoking.

the prosecutor turned to me again, with a gloating look in his eyes. my counsel
asked  the  doorkeeper  if  he,  too,  hadn’t  smoked.  but  the  prosecutor  took  strong
exception to this. “i’d like to know,” he cried indignantly, “who is on trial in this
court. or does my friend think that by aspersing a witness for the prosecution he will
shake the evidence, the abundant and cogent evidence, against his client?” none the
less, the judge told the doorkeeper to answer the question.

the witness is quite right. it’s true i offered him a cigarette.”

the  doorkeeper  looked  at  me  with  surprise  and  a  sort  of  gratitude.  then,  after
hemming  and  hawing  for  a  bit,  he  volunteered  the  statement  that  it  was  he  who’d
suggested i should have some coffee.

my lawyer was exultant. “the jury will appreciate,” he said, “the importance of

this admission.”

the prosecutor, however, was promptly on his feet again. “quite so,” he boomed
above our heads. “the jury will appreciate it. and they will draw the conclusion that,
though a third party might inadvertently offer him a cup of coffee, the prisoner, in
common decency, should have refused it, if only out of respect for the dead body of
the poor woman who had brought him into the world.”

after which the doorkeeper went back to his seat.

stated  that,  though  he  had  been  a  great friend  of  my  mother,  he  had  met  me  once
only, on the day of the funeral. asked how i had behaved that day, he said:

“well, i was most upset, you know. far too much upset to notice things. my grief
sort of blinded me, i think. it had been a great shock, my dear friend’s death; in fact,
i fainted during the funeral. so i didn’t hardly notice the young gentleman at all.”

the prosecutor asked him to tell the court if he’d seen me weep. and when pérez

answered, “no,” added emphatically: “i trust the jury will take note of this reply.”

my lawyer rose at once, and asked pérez in a tone that seemed to me needlessly

aggressive:

“now, think well, my man! can you swear you saw he didn’t shed a tear?”
pérez answered, “no.”
at this some people tittered, and my lawyer, pushing back one sleeve of his gown,

said sternly:

to elicit the true facts.”

the prosecutor ignored this remark; he was making dabs with his pencil on the

cover of his brief, seemingly quite indifferent.

there was a break of five minutes, during which my lawyer told me the case was
going very well indeed. then céleste was called. he was announced as a witness for
the defense. the defense meant me.

now  and  again  céleste  threw  me  a  glance;  he  kept  squeezing  his  panama  hat

ollar on; the top of his shirt, i noticed, was secured only by a
brass stud. asked if i was one of his customers, he said, “yes, and a friend as well.”
asked  to  state  his  opinion  of  me,  he  said  that  i  was  “all  right”  and,  when  told  to
explain what he meant by that, he replied that everyone knew what that meant. “was
i a secretive sort of man?” “no,” he answered, “i shouldn’t call him that. but he isn’t
one to waste his breath, like a lot of folks.”

the  prosecutor  asked  him  if  i  always  settled  my  monthly  bill  at  his  restaurant
when he presented it. céleste laughed. “oh, he paid on the nail, all right. but the bills

were  just  details-like,  between  him  and  me.”  then  he  was  asked  to  say  what  he
thought about the crime. he placed his hands on the rail of the box and one could see
he had a speech all ready.

she appeared very nervous.

the first question was: how long had she known me? since the time when she
was  in  our  office,  she  replied.  then  the  judge  asked  her  what  were  the  relations
between us, and she said she was my girl friend. answering another question, she
admitted promising to marry me. the prosecutor, who had been studying a document
in front of him, asked her rather sharply when our “liaison” had begun. she gave the
date. he then observed with a would-be casual air that apparently she meant the day
following my  mother’s funeral.  after  letting  this  sink  in he  remarked  in  a  slightly
ironic  tone  that  obviously  this  was  a  “delicate  topic”  and  he  could  enter  into  the
young lady’s feelings, but—and here his voice grew sterner—his duty obliged him to
waive

considerations of delicacy.

after  making  this  announcement  he  asked  marie  to  give  a  full  account  of  our
doings  on  the  day  when  i  had  “intercourse”  with  her  for  the  first  time.  marie
wouldn’t answer at first, but the prosecutor insisted, and then she told him that we
had met at the baths, gone together to the pictures, and then to my place. he then
informed  the  court  that,  as  a  result  of  certain  statements  made  by  marie  at  the



58

albert camus (cid:153) the stranger

proceedings before the magistrate, he had studied the movie programs of that date,
and turning to marie asked her to name the film that we had gone to see. in a very
low voice she said it was a picture with fernandel in it. by the time s

he had finished,
the courtroom was so still you could have heard a pin drop.

looking  very  grave,  the  prosecutor  drew  himself  up  to  his  full  height  and,
pointing at me, said in such a tone that i could have sworn he was genuinely moved:
“gentlemen  of  the  jury,  i  would  have  you  note  that  on  the  next  day  after  his
mother’s funeral that man was visiting the swimming pool, starting a liaison with a
girl, and going to see a comic film. that is all i wish to say.”

when he sat down there was the same dead silence. then all of a sudden marie
burst into tears. he’d got it all wrong,

ur views on the case, and you must confine

yourself to answering the questions put you.”

he was then asked to make clear his relations with the deceased, and raymond
took this opportunity of explaining that it was he, not i, against whom the dead man
had a grudge, because he, raymond, had beaten up his sister. the judge asked him if
the deceased had no reason to dislike me, too. raymond told him that my presence
on the beach that morning was a pure coincidence.

“how comes it then,” the prosecutor inquired, “that the letter which led up to this

tragedy was the prisoner’s work?”

raymond replied that this, too, was due to mere chance.
to which the prosecutor retorted that in this case “chance” or “mere coincidence”
seemed to play a remarkably large part. was it by chance that i hadn’t intervened
when raymond assaulted his mistress? did this convenient term “chance” account
for my having vouched for raymond at the police station and having made, on that
occasion,  stat

ements  extravagantly  favorable  to  him?  in  conclusion  he  asked
raymond to state what were his means of livelihood.

on his describing himself as a warehouseman, the prosecutor informed the jury it
was common knowledge that the witness lived on the immoral earnings of women. i,
he said, was this man’s intimate friend and associate; in fact, the whole background
of the crime was of the most squalid description. and what made it even more odious
was  the  personality  of  the  prisoner,  an  inhuman  monster  wholly  without  a  moral
sense.

raymond began to expostulate, and my lawyer, too, protested. they were told that

the prosecutor must be allowed to finish his

remarks.

“i have nearly done,” he said; then turned to raymond. “was the prisoner your

friend?”

did not turn away.

“certainly. we were the best of pals, as they say.”
the prosecutor then put me the same question. i looked hard at raymond, and he

then, “yes,” i answered.
the prosecutor turned toward the jury.
“not only did the man before you in the dock indulge in the most shameful orgies
on  the  day  following  his  mother’s  death.  he  killed  a  man  cold-bloodedly,  in
pursuance of some sordid vendetta in the underworld of prostitutes and pimps. that,
gentlemen of the jury, is the type of man the prisoner is.”

no sooner had he sat down than my lawyer, out of all patience, raised his arms so

high that his sleeves fell back, showing the full length of his starched

 shirt cuffs.

“is my client on trial for having buried his mother, or for killing a man?” he asked.
there were some titters in court. but then the prosecutor sprang to his feet and,
draping his gown round him, said he was amazed at his friend’s ingenuousness in
failing to see that between these two elements of the case there was a vital link. they
hung  together  psychologically,  if  he  might  put  it  so.  “in  short,”  he  concluded,
speaking with great vehemence, “i accuse the prisoner of behaving at his mother’s
funeral in a way that showed he was already a criminal at heart.”

these words seemed to take much effect on the jury and

it  is  always  interesting,  even  in  the  prisoner’s  dock,  to  hear  oneself  being  talked
about.  and  certainly  in  the  speeches  of  my  lawyer  and  the  prosecuting  counsel  a
great  deal  was  said  about  me;  more,  in  fact,  about  me  personally  than  about  my
crime.

really there wasn’t any very great difference between the two speeches. counsel
for the defense raised his arms to heaven and pleaded guilty, but with extenuating
circumstances. the prosecutor made similar gestures; he agreed that i was guilty, but
denied extenuating circumstances.

one thing about this phase of the trial was rather irksome. quite often, interested
as i was in what they had to say, i was tempted to put in a word, myself. but my
lawyer had advised me not to. “you won’t do your case any good by talking,” he had
warned  me.  in  fact,  there  seemed  to  be  a  conspiracy  to  exclude  me  from  the
proceedings; i wasn’t to have any say and my fate was to be dec

ided out of hand.

it was quite an effort at times for me to refrain from cutting them all short, and
saying: “but, damn it all, who’s on trial in this court, i’d like to know? it’s a serious
matter for a man, being accused of murder. and i’ve something really important to
tell you.”

however, on second thoughts, i found i had nothing to say. in any case, i must
admit that hearing oneself talked about loses its interest very soon. the prosecutor’s
speech,  especially,  began  to  bore  me  before  he  was  halfway  through  it.  the  only
things  that  really  caught  my  attention  were  occasional  phrases,  his  gestures,  and
some elaborate tirades—but these were isolated patches.

what he was aiming at, i gathered, was to show that my crime was premeditated. i
remember his saying at one moment, “i can prove this, gentlemen of the jury, to the
hilt. first, you have the facts of the crime; which are as clear as daylight. and t

ce of explaining to him, in a
quite friendly, almost affectionate way, that i have never been able really to regret
anything  in  all  my  life.  i’ve  always  been  far  too  much  absorbed  in  the  present
moment, or the immediate future, to think back. of course, in the position into which
i had been forced, there was no question of my speaking to anyone in that tone. i
hadn’t the right to show any friendly feeling or possess good intentions. and i tried
to follow what came next, as the prosecutor was now considering what he called my
“soul.”

he  said  he’d  studied  it  closely—and  had  found  a  blank,  “literally  nothing,
gentlemen of the jury.” really, he said, i had no soul, there was nothing human about
me, not one of those moral qualities which normal men possess had any place in my
mentality. “no doubt,” he added, “we should not reproach him with this. we cannot
blame a man for lacking what it was never in his power to acquire. but in a criminal
court the who

ve place to a sterner, loftier ideal,
that of justice. especially when this lack of every decent instinct is such as that of the
man before you, a menace to society.” he proceeded to discuss my conduct toward
my mother, repeating what he had said in the course of the hearing. but he spoke at
much greater length of my crime—at such length, indeed, that i lost the thread and
was conscious only of the steadily increasing heat.

a moment came when the prosecutor paused and, after a short silence, said in a
low, vibrant voice: “this same court, gentlemen, will be called on to try tomorrow
that most odious of crimes, the murder of a father by his son.” to his mind, such a
crime was almost unimaginable. but, he ventured to hope, justice would be meted
out without paltering. and yet, he made bold to say, the horror that even the crime of
parricide inspired in him paled beside the loathing inspired by my callousness.

“this man, who is morally guilty

 the father that begat
him. and, indeed, the one crime led on to the other; the first of these two criminals,
the man in the dock, set a precedent, if i may put it so, and authorized the second
crime. yes, gentlemen, i am convinced”—here he raised his voice a tone—“that you
will not find i am exaggerating the case against the prisoner when i say that he is also
guilty  of  the  murder  to  be  tried  tomorrow  in  this  court.  and  i  look  to  you  for  a
verdict accordingly.”

the  prosecutor  paused  again,  to  wipe  the  sweat  off  his  face.  he  then  explained
that his duty was a painful one, but he would do it without flinching. “this man has,
i  repeat,  no  place  in  a  community  whose  basic  principles  he  flouts  without
compunction. nor, heartless as he is, has he any claim to mercy. i ask you to impose
the extreme penalty of the law; and i ask it without a qualm. in the course of a long
career, in which it has often been my duty to ask for a capital sentence, nev

er have i
felt that painful duty weigh so little on my mind as in the present case. in demanding
a verdict of murder without extenuating circumstances, i am following not only the
dictates of my conscience and a sacred obligation, but also those of the natural and
righteous  indignation  i  feel  at  the  sight  of  a  criminal  devoid  of  the  least  spark  of
human feeling.”

when the prosecutor sat down there was a longish silence. personally i was quite
overcome by the heat and my amazement at what i had been hearing. the presiding
judge gave a short cough, and asked me in a very low tone if i had anything to say. i
rose, and as i felt in the mood to speak, i said the first thing that crossed my mind:
that i’d had no intention of killing the arab. the judge replied that this statement
would be taken into consideration by the court. meanwhile he would be glad to hear,
before my coun

t seemed to me that the
idea behind it was still further to exclude me from the case, to put me off the map. so
to speak, by substituting the lawyer for myself. anyway, it hardly mattered; i already
felt worlds away from this courtroom and its tedious “proceedings.”

my lawyer, in any case, struck me as feeble to the point of being ridiculous. he
hurried through his plea of provocation, and then he, too, started in about my soul.
but i had an impression that he had much less talent than the prosecutor.

“i,  too,”  he  said,  “have  closely  studied  this  man’s  soul;  but,  unlike  my  learned
friend  for  the  prosecution,  i  have  found  something  there.  indeed,  i  may  say  that  i
have read the prisoner’s mind like an open book.” what he had read there was that i
was an excellent young fellow, a steady, conscientious worker who did his best by
his employer; that i was popular with everyone and sympathetic in others’ troubles.
according to him i was a dutiful son, who
