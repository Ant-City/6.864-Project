sprinkle of windows came suddenly alight miles off in dawn country. 

"everyone yawn. everyone up." 

the great house stirred below. 

"grandpa, get your teeth from the water glass!" he waited a decent interval. 
"grandma and great-grandma, fry hot cakes!" 

the warm scent of fried batter rose in the drafty halls to stir the boarders, the aunts, 
the uncles, the visiting cousins, in their rooms. 

"street where all the old people live, wake up! miss helen loomis, colonel freeleigh, 
miss bentley! cough, get up, take pills, move around! mr. jonas, hitch up your horse, get 
your junk wagon out and around!" 

the bleak mansions across the town ravine opened baleful dragon eyes. soon, in the

morning avenues below, two old women would glide their electric green machine, waving 
at all the dogs. "mr. tridden, run to the carbarn!" soon, scattering hot blue sparks above 
it, the town trolley would sail the rivering brick streets.

"a time machine!" panted charlie woodman, pacing him. "mother's, scout's, injun's 
honor!" 

"travels in the past and future?" john huff asked, easily circling them. 
"only in the past, but you can't have everything. here we are." 
charlie woodman pulled up at a hedge. 

douglas peered in at the old house. "heck, that's colonel freeleigh's place. can't be

no time machine in there. he's no inventor, and if he was, we'd known about an 
important thing like a time machine years ago." 

charlie and john tiptoed up the front-porch steps. douglas snorted and shook his 
head, staying at the bottom of: the steps. 

"okay, douglas," said charlie. "be a knucklehead. sure, colonel freeleigh didn't invent 
this time machine. but he's got a proprietary interest in it, and it's been here all th

charlie took john's elbow as though he was escorting a lady, opened the front-porch 
screen and went in. the screen door did not slam. 

douglas had caught the screen and was following silently. 

charlie walked across the enclosed porch, knocked, and opened the inside door. they

"he don't hear so good," whispered charlie. "but he told me to just come on in and 
yell. colonel!" 

the only answer was the dust sifting down and around the spiral stairwell from above. 
then there was a faint stir in that undersea chamber at the far end of the hall. 

they moved carefully along and peered into room which contained but two pieces of 
furniture-an old man and a chair. they resembled each other, both so thin you could see 
just how they had been put together, bal

"colonel?" 

one of the pieces of brown furniture moved and it was the colonel, blinking around, 
focusing, and smiling a wild and toothless smile. "charlie!" 

"colonel, doug and john here came to—" 

"welcome, boys; sit down, sit down!"

the boys sat, uneasily, on the floor.

"but where's the—" said douglas. charlie jabbed his ribs quickly. 
"where's the what?" asked colonel freeleigh. 

"where's the point in us talking, he means." charlie grimaced at douglas, then smiled 
at the old man. "we got nothing to say. colonel, you say something." 

"beware, charlie, old men only lie in wait for people to' ask them to talk. then they 
rattle on like a rusty elevator wheezing up a shaft." 

"ching ling soo," suggested charlie casually. 

"eh?" said the colonel. 

"boston," charlie prompted, "1910." 

"boston, 1910 . . ."the colonel frowned. "why, ching ling soo, of course!" "yes, si

"let me see, now . . ." the colonel's voice murmured, it drifted away on serene lake 
waters. "let me see ..." 

the boys waited. 

colonel freeleigh closed his eyes. 

"october first, 1910, a calm cool fine autumn night, the boston variety theatre, yes, 
there it is. full house, all waiting. orchestra, fanfare, curtain! ching ling soo, the great 
oriental magician! there he is, on stage! and there i am, front row center! the bullet

colonel freeleigh took a deep breath and paused. 

douglas was staring at him, half puzzled, half in awe. john huff and charlie were 
completely lost. now the old man went on, his head and body frozen, only his lips 
moving. 

"'ready, aim, fire!' cries ching ling soo. bang! the rifle cracks. bang! ching ling soo 
shrieks, he staggers, he falls, his face all red. pandemonium. audience on its feet.

fast and the women weeping . . .1910 . . . boston . . . variety theatre . . . poor man . . . 

colonel freeleigh slowly opened his eyes. 

"boy, colonel," said charlie, "that was fine. now how about pawnee bill?" 
"pawnee bill . . . ?" 

"and the time you was on the prairie way back in 75." 

"pawnee bill . . ."the colonel moved into darkness. "eighteen seventy-five . . .yes, me 
and pawnee bill on a little rise in the middle of the prairie, waiting. 'shh!' says pawnee 
bill. 'listen.' the prairie like a big stage all set for the storm to come. thunder. soft.

satisfied not to hear. for a little while i wanted to remember the thunder. i hear it still, 
on summer afternoons like this when the rain shapes over the lake; a fearsome, 
wondrous sound . . .one i wish you might have heard . . ." 

the dim light filtered through colonel freeleigh's nose which was large and like white 
porcelain which cupped a very thin and tepid orange tea indeed. 

"is he asleep?" asked douglas at last. 

"no," said charlie. "just recharging his batteries." 

colonel freeleigh breathed swiftly, softly, as if he'd run a long way. at last he opened 
his eyes. 

"yes, sir" said charlie, in admiration. 

"hello charlie." the colonel smiled at the boys puzzledly. 

"that's doug and that's john," said charlie. 

"how-de-do, boys." 

the boys said hello.

the colonel looked at the boys for a full five seconds. now it was his voice that was 
full of awe. 

"is that what you boys call me?" "yes, sir, colonel." 
"yes, sir." 

the colonel sat slowly back in his chair and looked at the boys and looked at his hands 
and then looked at the blank wall beyond them steadily. 

charlie arose. "well, i guess we better go. so long and thanks, colonel." 

"what? oh, so long, boys." 

douglas and john and charlie went on tiptoe out the door. 

colonel freeleigh, though they crossed his line of vision, did not see them go. 



in the street, the boys were startled when someone shouted from a first-floor window 
above, "hey!" 

they looked up. 

"yes, sir, colonel?" 

the colonel leaned out, waving one arm.

"yes, sir?" 

"and-you're right! why didn't i think of it before! a time machine, by god, a time

"yes, sir."

douglas went on writing. "it means you and me ain't:; got half the chance to be far- 
travelers they have. if we're lucky we'll hit forty, forty-five, fifty, that's just a jog around 
the block to them. it's when you hit ninety, ninety-five, a hundred, that you're far- 
traveling like heck." 

the flashlight went out. 

they lay there in the moonlight. 

"tom," whispered douglas. "i got to travel all those ways. see what i can see. but 
most of all i got to visit colonel freeleigh once, twice, three times a week. he's better 
than all the other machines. he talks, you listen. and the more he talks the more he gets 
you to peering around and noticing things. he tells you you're riding on a very special 
train, by gosh, and sure enough, it's hue. he's been down the track, and knows. and now

"no!" 

colonel freeleigh opened his eyes quickly, sat erect in his wheel chair. he jerked his 
cold hand out to find the telephone. it was still there! he crushed it against his chest for 
a moment, blinking. 

"i don't like that dream," he said to his empty room. 

at last, his fingers trembling, he lifted the receiver and called the long-distance 
operator and gave her a number and waited, watching the bedroom door as if at any 
moment a plague of sons, daughters, grandsons, nurses, doctors, might swarm in to

time to time. 

"colonel freeleigh," said the operator. "here's your call. mexico city. erickson 3899." 

and now the far away but infinitely clear voice:

"senor freeleigh! again? this costs money." 

"let it cost! you know what to do." 

"si. the window?" 

"the window, jorge, if you please."

"senor . . ." 

"no, no, please. let me listen." 

he listened to the hooting of many metal horns, squealing of brakes, the calls of 
vendors selling red-purple bananas and jungle oranges in their stalls. colonel freeleigh's 
feet began to move, hanging from the edge of his wheel chair, making the motions of a 
man walking. his eyes squeezed tight. he gave a series of immense sniffs, as if to gain 
the odors of meats hung on iron hooks in sunshine, cloaked with flies like a mantle of

time passed. 

a downstairs door opened slowly. light footsteps came in, hesitated, then ventured up 
the stairs. voices murmured. 

"we shouldn't be here!" 

"he phoned me, i tell you. he needs visitors bad. we can't let him down." 
"he's sick!" 

"sure! but he said to come when the nurse's out. we'll only stay a second, say hello, 
and . . ." 

the door to the bedroom moved wide. the three boys stood looking in at the old man 
seated there on the floor. 

"colonel freeleigh?" said douglas softly. 

there was something in his silence that made them all shut up their mouths. 
they approached, almost on tiptoe. 

douglas, bent down, disengaged the phone from the old man's now quite cold fingers. 
douglas lifted the receiver to his own ear, listened. above the static he heard a strange, 
a far, a final sound. 

two thousand miles away, the closing of a window. 



"boom!!" said tom. "boom. boom. boom."

"you look like you're going to get out the old pencil any second now," said tom. 

"let me think!" said douglas, looking at the cannon. he rolled over and gazed at the 
sky and the trees above him. "tom, it just hit me."

"what?" 

"yesterday ching ling soo died. yesterday the civil war ended right here in this town 
forever. yesterday mr. lincoln died right here and so did general lee and general grantl 
and a hundred thousand others facing north and south. and yesterday afternoon, at 
colonel freeleigh's house, a herd of buffalo-bison as big as all green town, illinois, went 
off the cliff into nothing at all. yesterday a whole lot of dust settled for good. and i didn't 
even appreciate it at the time. it's awful, tom, it's awful! what we going to do without all 
those soldiers and generals lee and grant and honest abe; what we going to do without

and yet . . .looking here at this bottle which by its number signalized the day when

man were on a boat pulling away, with all the others left behind on the bright shore, 
running, jumping, hilarious with motion, not knowing that the boat, the dead man and 
douglas were going, going, and now gone into darkness. weeping, douglas ran to the 
lemon-smelling men's room where, sick, it seemed a fire hydrant churned three times 
from his throat. 

and waiting for the sickness to pass he thought: all the people i know who died this 
summer! colonel freeleigh, dead! i didn't know it before; why? great-grandma, dead,

without a sound. you'll have to anyway, said the voice, you'll have to anyway . . .

douglas moved his head flat over, crashing on the white white terribly white pillow.

hands as white as doves. they sank into the lawn's deep waters, their gloves still waving 
to him as the grass closed over . . .

and quickly then from a window across the way colonel freeleigh leaned out with the 
face of a clock, and buffalo dust sprang up in the street. colonel freeleigh spanged and 
rattled, his jaw fell open, a mainspring shot out and dangled on the air instead of his 
tongue. he collapsed like a puppet on the sill, one arm still waving . . .
