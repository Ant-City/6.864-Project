Sophist - 
                The
Sophists were teachers-for-hire who educated the wealthy men of
Athens in the fifth century B.C. Though they
were a diverse group with diverse opinions, they tended to share
a disregard for the notion of objective truth and knowledge. This
disregard extended to the notion of objective moral truth, which
means that they did not believe in such a things as "right" and "wrong."
One of the guiding motivations in all of Plato's work was to prove
the Sophists wrong: to show that there is such a thing as objective
truth, and that we can have knowledge of this objective truth.
