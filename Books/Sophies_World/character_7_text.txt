afternoon and her father was away so much, sailing all over the world.
sophie slung her schoolbag on the floor and put a bowl of cat food out for sherekan.
then she sat down on a kitchen stool with the mysterious letter in her hand.
who are you?
she had no idea. she was sophie amundsen, of course, but who was that? she had
not really figured that out--yet.
what if she had been given a different name? anne knutsen, for instance. would she
then have been someone else?
she suddenly remembered that dad had originally wanted her to be called lillemor.
sophie tried to imagine herself shaking hands and introducing herself as lillemor
amundsen, but it seemed all wrong. it was someone else who kept introducing
herself.
she jumped up and went into the bathroom with the strange letter in her hand. she
stood in front of the mirror and stared into her own eyes.
"i am sophie amundsen," she said.
the girl in the mirror did not react with as much as a twitch. whatever sophie did,
she did exactly the same

world without at least inquiring where it came from.
the mysterious letters had made sophie's head spin. she decided to go and sit in the
den.
the den was sophie's top secret hiding place. it was where she went when she was
terribly angry, terribly miserable, or terribly happy. today she was simply confused.

the red house was surrounded by a large garden with lots of flowerbeds, fruit bushes,
fruit trees of different kinds, a spacious lawn with a glider and a little gazebo that
granddad had built for granny when she lost their first child a few weeks after it was
born. the child's name was marie. on her gravestone were the words: "little marie to
us came, greeted us, and left again."
down in a corner of the garden behind all the raspberry bushes was a dense thicket
where neither flowers nor berries would grow. actually, it was an old hedge that had
once marked the boundary to the woods, but because nobody had trimmed it for the
last twenty years it had grown into a tangled and

 mysterious, almost.
who had jolted sophie out of her everyday existence and suddenly brought her face to
face with the great riddles of the universe?
for the third time sophie went to the mailbox. the mailman had just delivered the
day's mail. sophie fished out a bulky pile of junk mail, periodicals, and a couple of
letters for her mother. there was also a postcard of a tropical beach. she turned the
card over. it had a nor-wegian stamp on it and was postmarked "un battalion."
could it be from dad? but wasn't he in a completely different place? it wasn't his
handwriting either.
sophie felt her pulse quicken a little as she saw who the postcard was addressed to:
"hilde moller knag, c/o sophie amundsen, 3 clover close ..." the rest of the address
was correct. the card read:
dear hilde, happy 15th birthday! as i'm sure you'll understand, i want to give you a
present that will help you grow. forgive me for sending the card c/o sophie. it was the
easiest way. love from dad.
sophie raced back

u feel as if you are waking from an enchanted slumber. who am i? you ask. you
know that you are stumbling around on a planet in the universe. but what is the

if you discover yourself in this manner you will have discovered something as
mysterious as the martian we just mentioned. you will not only have seen a being
from outer space. you will feel deep down that you are yourself an extraordinary
being. 
do you follow me, sophie? let's do another experiment in thought:
one morning, mom, dad, and little thomas, aged two or three, are having breakfast
in the kitchen. after a while mom gets up and goes over to the kitchen sink, and
dad--yes, dad--flies up and floats around under the ceiling while thomas sits
watching. what do you think thomas says? perhaps he points up at his father and
says: "daddy's flying!" thomas will certainly be astonished, but then he very often is.
dad does so many strange things that this business of a little flight over the breakfast
table makes no differen

sometimes he climbs onto the roof and turns the tv aerial--or else he sticks his head
under the hood of the car and comes up black in the face.
now it's mom's turn. she hears what thomas says and turns around abruptly. how do
you think she reacts to the sight of dad floating nonchalantly over the kitchen table?
she drops the jam jar on the floor and screams with fright. she may even need
medical attention once dad has returned respectably to his chair. (he should have
learned better table manners by now!) why do you think thomas and his mother react
so differently?
it all has to do with habit. (note this!) mom has learned that people cannot fly.
thomas has not. he still isn't certain what you can and cannot do in this world.
but what about the world itself, sophie? do you think it can do what it does? the
world is also floating in space.
sadly it is not only the force of gravity we get used to as we grow

lebrating your 15th birthday. or is this the
morning after? anyway, it makes no difference to your present. in a sense, that will
last a lifetime. but i'd like to wish you a happy birthday one more time. perhaps you
understand now why i send the cards to sophie. i am sure she will pass them on to
you.
p.s. mom said you had lost your wallet. i hereby promise to reimburse you the 150

sophie stood glued to the spot. when was the previous card postmarked? she seemed
to recall that the postcard of the beach was also postmarked june--even though it was
a whole month off. she simply hadn't looked properly.
she glanced at her watch and then ran back to the house. she would just have to be
late for school today!
sophie let herself in and leaped upstairs to her room. she found the first postcard to
hilde under the red silk scarf. yes! it was also postmarked june 15! sophie's birth

p.s. i'm sending a copy of this card to our mutual friend. i know you understand,
hilde. at the moment i'm being very secretive, but you will understand.
sophie picked up the next card:
dear hilde, down here we take one day at a time. if there is one thing i'm going to
remember from these months in lebanon, it's all this waiting. but i'm doing what i
can so you have as great a 15th birthday as possible. i can't say any more at the
moment. i'm imposing a severe censorship on myself. love, dad.
the two friends sat breathless with excitement. neither of them spoke, they just read
what was written on the cards:
my dear child, what i would like best would be to send you my secret thoughts with a
white dove. but they are all out of white doves in lebanon. if there is anything this
war-torn country needs, it is white doves. i pray the un will truly manage to make
peace in the world some day.
p.s. maybe your birthday present can be shared with other people. let's talk about
that when i get

when they had read six cards, there was only one left. it read:
dear hilde, i am now so bursting with all these secrets for your birthday that i have to
stop myself several times a day from calling home and blowing the whole thing. it is
something that simply grows and grows. and as you know, when a thing gets bigger
and bigger it's more difficult to keep it to yourself. love from dad.
p.s. some day you will meet a girl called sophie. to give you both a chance to get to
know more about each other before you meet, i have begun sending her copies of all
the cards i send to you. i expect she will soon begin to catch on, hilde. as yet she
knows no more than you. she has a girlfriend called joanna. maybe site can be of 
help?
after reading the last card, joanna and sophie sat quite still staring wildly at each
other. joanna was holding sophie's wrist in a tight grip.

ated june 15. sophie removed the casserole from the stove and 
sat down at the kitchen table. the card read:
dear hilde, i don't know whether it will still be your birthday when you read this card.
i hope so, in a way; or at least that not too many days have gone by. a week or two for
sophie does not have to mean just as long for us. i shall be coming home for
midsummer eve, so we can sit together for hours in the glider, looking out over the
sea, hilde. we have so much to talk about. love from dad, who sometimes gets very
depressed about the thousand-year-long strife between jews, christians, and muslims.
i have to keep reminding myself that all three religions stem from abraham. so i
suppose they all pray to the same god. down here, cain and abel have not finished
killing each other.
p.s. please say hello to sophie. poor child, she still doesn't know how this whole thing
hangs together. but perhaps you do?
sophie put her head down on the table, exhausted. one thing was certain--she had

idea how this thing hung together. but hilde did, presumably.
if hilde's father asked her to say hello to sophie, it had to mean that hilde knew more
about sophie than sophie did about hilde. it was all so complicated that sophie went
back to fixing dinner.
a postcard that smacked against the kitchen window all by itself! you could call that
airmail!
as soon as she had set the casserole on the stove again, the telephone rang.
suppose it was dad! she wished desperately that he would come home so she could
tell him everything that had happened in these last weeks. but it was probably only
joanna or mom. sophie snatched up the phone.
"sophie amundsen," she said.
 "it's me," said a voice.
sophie was sure of three things: it was not her father. but it was a man's voice, and a
voice she knew she had heard before. 
"who is this?"
"it's alberto."
"ohhh!"
sophie was at a loss for words. it was the voice from the acropolis video that she had

middle east had also been part of the roman empire. this area developed during the
middle ages into an arabic-speaking muslim culture. after the death of muhammad
in 632, both the middle east and north africa were won over to islam. shortly
thereafter, spain also became part of the world of islamic culture. islam adopted
mecca, medina, jerusalem, and bagdad as holy cities. from the point of view of

the arabs. all through the middle ages, the arabs were predominant hi sciences such

e when sophie reached joanna's front gate, out of breath with running.
joanna was standing in the front yard outside her family's yellow house.
"you've been gone for five hours!" joanna said sharply.
sophie shook her head.
"no, i've been gone for more than a thousand years."
"where on earth have you been? you're crazy. your mom called half an hour ago."
"what did you tell her?"
"i said you were at the drugstore. she said would you call her when you got back. but 
you should have seen my mom and dad when they came in with hot chocolate and
rolls at ten this morning ... and your bed was empty."
"what did you say to them?"
"it was really embarrassing. i told them you went home because we got mad at each
other."
"so we'd better hurry up and be friends again. and we have to make sure your parents
don't talk to my mom for a few days. do you think we can do that?"
joanna shrugged. just then her father came around the corner with a wheelbarrow. he
had a pair of coveralls on and was busy clearing

"aha--so you're friends again, i see. well, there's not so much as a single leaf left on

"fine," said sophie. "so perhaps we can have our hot chocolate there instead of in
bed."
joanna's dad gave a forced laugh, but joanna gasped. verbal exchanges had always
been more robust in sophie's family than at the more well-to-do home of mr.
ingebrigtsen, the financial adviser, and his wife.
"i'm sorry, joanna, but i felt i ought to take part in this cover-up operation as well."
"are you going to tell me about it?"
"sure, if you walk home with me. because it's not for the ears of financial advisers or
overgrown barbie dolls."

hermes was already on his way up the stairs. sophie took the postcard with her and
followed. she had to run to keep up with him; he was wagging his tail delightedly.
they passed the second, third, and fourth stories. from then on there was only an attic

stopped outside a narrow door, which he scratched at with his paw.
sophie heard footsteps approaching from inside. the door opened,

"what's going on, sophie?"
"nothing."
"yes, there is. you have a boyfriend, and i'm beginning to think he's much older than
you. answer me now: do you know a man in lebanon?"
"no, not exactly..." 
"have you met the son of someone in lebanon?"
"no, i haven't. i haven't even met his daughter."
"whose daughter?"
"it's none of your business."
"i think it is."
"maybe i should start asking some questions instead. why is dad never home? is it
because you haven't got the guts to get a divorce? maybe you've got a boyfriend you
don't want dad and me to know about and so on and so on. i've got plenty of
questions of my own."
"i think we need to talk."
"that may be. but right now i'm so worn out i'm going to bed. and i'm getting my

sophie ran up to her room; she felt like crying.
as soon as she was through in the bathroom and had curled up under the covers, her
mother came into the bedroom.

"i have to sleep now. i've got such awful cramps."
"do you want an aspirin?" /'yes, please."
when her mother returned with the pill and a glass of water sophie had fallen asleep.
may 31 was a thursday. sophie agonized through the afternoon classes at school. she
was doing better in some subjects since she started on the philosophy course. usually
her grades were good in most subjects, but lately they were even better, except in
math.

long trip home.
sophie had just managed to finish reading the card when the last bell rang. once again
her thoughts were in turmoil.
joanna was waiting in the playground. on the way home sophie opened her
schoolbag and showed joanna the latest card.
"when is it postmarked?" asked joanna.
"probably june 15 ..."
"no, look ... 5/30/90, it says." 
 "that was yesterday ... the day after the death of the major in lebanon."

she lost the coin here on new square. it is then perfectly possible that the very same
coin was picked up later on that day by a girl who really needed it to get home by bus.
you never can tell, hilde, but if it is truly so, then one must certainly ask whether or
not god's providence is behind everything. love, dad, who in spirit is sitting on the
dock at home in lillesand. p.s. i said i would help you find the ten crowns.
on the address side it said: "hilde moller knag, c/o a casual passer-by..." the
postmark was stamped 6/15/90.
sophie ran up the stairs after hermes. as soon as alberto opened the door, she said:
"out of my way. here comes the mailman."
she felt she had every reason to be annoyed. alberto stood aside as she barged in.
hermes laid himself down under the coat pegs as before.

threw it in her wastebasket.
friday, june 15, 1990, said the calendar now, shining at her. way back in january she
had written "15th birthday" on this page. she felt it was extra-special to be fifteen on
the fifteenth. it would never happen again.
fifteen! wasn't this the first day of her adult life? she couldn't just go back to bed.
furthermore, it was the last day of school before the summer vacation. the students
just had to appear in church at one o'clock. and what was more, in a week dad would
be home from lebanon. he had promised to be home for midsummer eve.
hilde stood by the window and looked out over the garden, down toward the dock
behind the little red boat-house. the motorboat had not yet been brought out for the
summer, but the old rowboat was tied up to the dock. she must remember to bail the
water out of it after last night's heavy downpour.
as she was looking out over the little bay, she remembered the time when as a little
girl of six she had climbed up into the ro

wn shadow. in the end she had been given the old family
heirloom to keep. through the years she had tried from time to time to master the
impossible art.
not surprisingly, she was pensive today. and not unnaturally, she was preoccupied
with herself. fifteen years old ...
she happened to glance at her bedside table. there was a large package there. it had
pretty blue wrapping and was tied with a red silk ribbon. it must be a birthday
present!
could this be the present? the great big present from dad that had been so very secret? 
he had dropped so many cryptic hints in his cards from lebanon. but he had
"imposed a severe censorship on himself."
the present was something that "grew bigger and bigger," he had written. then he
had said something about a girl she was soon to meet--and that he had sent copies of
all his cards to her. hilde had tried to pump her mother for clues, but she had no idea
what he meant, either.
the oddest hint had been that the present could perhaps be "shared with ot

government. may the un one day really be able to unite the whole of humanity, he
had written on one of his cards.
was she allowed to open the package before her mother came up to her room singing
"happy birthday to you," with pastry and a norwegian flag? surely that was why it
had been put there?
she walked quietly across the room and picked up the package. it was heavy! she
found the tag: to hilde on her 15th birthday from dad.
she sat on the bed and carefully untied the red silk ribbon. then she undid the blue
paper.
it was a large ring binder.
was this her present? was this the fifteenth-birthday present that there had been so
much fuss about? the present that grew bigger and bigger and could be shared with
other people?
a quick glance showed that the ring binder was rilled with typewritten pages. hilde
recognized them as being from her father's typewriter, the one he had taken with him
to lebanon.

sophie amundsen was on her way home from school. she had walked the first part of
the way with joanna. they had been discussing robots. joanna thought the human
brain was like an advanced computer. sophie was not certain she agreed. surely a
person was more than a piece of hardware?
hilde read on, oblivious of all else, even forgetting that it was her birthday. from time
to time a brief thought crept in between the lines as she read: had dad written a book?
had he finally begun on the significant novel and completed it in lebanon? he had
often complained that time hung heavily on one's hands in that part of the world.
sophie's father was far from home, too. she was probably the girl hilde would be
getting to know ...
only by conjuring up an intense feeling of one day being dead could she appreciate
how terribly good life was... . where does the world come from? ... at some point
something must have come from nothing. but was that p

ossible? wasn't that just as
impossible as the idea that the world had always existed?
hilde read on and on. with surprise, she read about sophie amundsen receiving a
postcard from lebanon: "hilde moller knag, c/o sophie amundsen, 3 clover
close..."
dear hilde, happy 15th birthday. as i'm sure you'll understand, i want to give you a
present that will help you grow. forgive me for sending the card c/o sophie. it was the
easiest way. love from dad.
the joker! hilde knew her father had always been a sly one, but today he had really
taken her by surprise! instead of tying the card on the package, he had written it into 
the book.
but poor sophie! she must have been totally confused!
why would a father send a birthday card to sophie's address when it was quite
obviously intended to go somewhere else? what kind of father would cheat his own
daughter of a birthday card by purposely sending it astray? how could it be "the
easiest way"? and abo
 
 ___________________________
 
 how was she supposed to trace this hilde person?
no, how could she?
hilde turned a couple of pages and began to read the second chapter, "the top hat."
she soon came to the long letter which a mysterious person had written to sophie.
being interested in why we are here is not a "casual" interest like collecting stamps.
people who ask such questions are taking part in a debate that has gone on as long as
man has lived on this planet.
"sophie was completely exhausted." so was hilde. not only had dad written a book
for her fifteenth birthday, he had written a strange and wonderful book.
to summarize briefly: a white rabbit is pulled out of a top hat. because it is an
extremely large rabbit, the trick takes many billions of years. all mortals are born at
the very tip of the rabbit's fine hairs, where they are in a position to wonder at the
impossibility of the trick. but as they grow older they work themselves ever deeper
into the fur. and there they stay . . .
sophie was not the only one wh

 anything actually "changed." he therefore assumed that everything
was built up of tiny invisible blocks, each of which was eternal and immutable.
democritus called these smallest units atoms.
hilde was indignant when sophie found the red silk scarf under her bed. so that was
where it was! but how could a scarf just disappear into a story? it had to be
someplace...
the chapter on socrates began with sophie reading "something about the norwegian
un battalion in lebanon" in the newspaper. typical dad! he was so concerned that
people in norway were not interested enough in the un forces' peacekeeping task. if
nobody else was, then sophie would have to be. in that way he could write it into his
story and get some sort of attention from the media.
she had to smile as she read the p.p.s. in the philosophy teacher's letter to sophie:
if you should come across a red silk scarf anywhere, please take care of it. sometimes
personal property gets mixed up. especially at school and places like that, a

lis. he looked almost exactly like hilde's
father--with a "black, well-trimmed beard" and a blue beret.
"happy birthday, hilde!" 
"uh-huh."
"hilde?"
"just put it there."
"aren't you going to ... ?"
"you can see i'm reading."
"imagine, you're fifteen!"
"have you ever been to athens, mom?"
"no, why do you ask?"
"it's so amazing that those old temples are still standing. they are actually 2,500 years
old. the biggest one is called the virgin's place, by the way."
"have you opened your present from dad?"
"what present?"
 "you must look up now, hilde. you're in a complete daze."
hilde let the large ring binder slide down onto her lap.
her mother stood leaning over the bed with the tray. on it were lighted candles,
buttered rolls with shrimp salad, and a soda. there was also a small package. her
mother stood awkwardly holding the tray with both hands, with a flag under one arm.
"oh, thanks a lot, mom. it's sweet of you, but i'm really busy."
"you don't have to go to school till one o'clock."

ating your fifteenth birthday. or is this the
morning after? anyway, it makes no difference to your present. in a sense, that will
last a lifetime. but i'd like to wish you a happy birthday one more time. perhaps you
understand now why i send the cards to sophie. i am sure she will pass them on to
you.

not bad! that made her 150 crowns richer. he probably thought a homemade present
alone wasn't enough.
so it appeared that june 15 was sophie's birthday, too. but sophie's calendar had only
gotten as far as the middle of may. that must have been when her father had written
this chapter, and he had postdated the "birthday card" to hilde. but poor sophie,
running down to the supermarket to meet joanna.
who was hilde? how could her father as good as take it for granted that sophie
would find her?

"but i haven't... i'm just going to rest for a while, then i'll start fixing a great dinner. i
managed to get hold of some strawberries."
"okay, i'll go on reading."
her mother left and hilde read on.
sophie is following hermes through the town. in alberto's hall she finds another card
from lebanon. this, too, is dated june 15.
hilde was just beginning to understand the system of the dates. the cards dated
before june 15 are copies of cards hilde had already received from her dad. but those
with today's date are reaching her for the first time via the ring binder.
dear hilde, now sophie is coming to the philosopher's house. she will soon be
fifteen, but you were fifteen yesterday. or is it today, hilde? if it is today, it must be
late, then. but our watches do not always agree . . .
hilde read how alberto told sophie about the renaissance and the new science, the
seventeenth-century rationalists and british empiricism.
she jumped at every new card and birthday greeting

orestation on the other? maybe it was not so
crazy to call man's thirst for knowledge a fall from grace?
the question was so huge and so terrifying that hilde tried to forget it again. she
would probably understand much more as she read further in her father's birthday
book.
"happy birthday to you ...," sang her mother when they were done with their ice
cream and italian strawberries. "now we'll do whatever you choose."
"i know it sounds a bit crazy, but all i want to do is read my present from dad."
"well, as long as he doesn't make you completely delirious." 
"no way."
"we could share a pizza while we watch that mystery on tv."
"yes, if you like."
hilde suddenly thought of the way sophie spoke to her mother. dad had hopefully not
written any of hilde's mother into the character of the other mother? just to make sure,
she decided not to mention the white rabbit being pulled out of the top hat. not today,
at least.
"by the way," she said as she was leaving the table.
"what?"
"i can't find

 my gold crucifix anywhere."
her mother looked at her with an enigmatic expression.
"i found it down by the dock weeks ago. you must have dropped it, you untidy
scamp."
"did you mention it to dad?"
"let me think ... yes, i believe i may have."
"where is it then?"
her mother got up and went to get her own jewelry case. hilde heard a little cry of
surprise from the bedroom. she came quickly back into the living room.
"right now i can't seem to find it."
"i thought as much."
she gave her mother a hug and ran upstairs to her room. at last--now she could read
on about sophie and alberto. she sat up on the bed as before with the heavy ring 
binder resting against her knees and began the next

it was close to midnight before major albert knag called home to wish hilde a happy
birthday. hilde's mother answered the telephone.
"it's for you, hilde."
"hello?"
"it's dad."
"are you crazy? it's nearly midnight!"
"i just wanted to say happy birthday ..."
"you've been doing that all day."
"... but i didn't want to call before the day was over."
"why?"
"didn't you get my present?"
"yes, i did. thank you very much."
"i can't wait to hear what you think of it." 
"it's terrific. i have hardly eaten all day, it's so exciting."
"i have to know how far you've gotten."

"but i have never heard that she knocked on the door of another house before she
went to her grandmother's."
"a bagatelle, sophie."
now sophie looked at the envelope she had been given. it was addressed "to hilde."
she opened it and read aloud:
dear hilde, if the human brain was simple enough for us to understand, we would
still be so stupid that we couldn't understand it. love, dad.
alberto nodded. "true enough. i believe kant said something to that effect. we
cannot expect to understand what we are. maybe we can comprehend a flower or an
insect, but we can never comprehend ourselves. even less can we expect to
comprehend the universe."
sophie had to read the cryptic sentence in the note to hilde several times before
alberto went on: "we are not going to be interrupted by sea serpents and the like.
before we stop for today, i'll tell you about kant's ethics."
"please hurr

father of the un idea. kant's point was that man's "practical reason" requires the
nations to emerge from their wild state of nature which creates wars, and contract to
keep the peace. although the road to the establishment of a league of nations is
laborious, it is our duty to work for the "universal and lasting securing of peace." the
establishment of such a league was for kant a far-distant goal. you could almost say it
was philosophy's ultimate goal. i am in lebanon at the moment. love, dad.
sophie put the note in her pocket and continued on her way homeward. this was the
kind of meeting in the woods alberto had warned her about. but she couldn't have let
the little teddy wander about in the woods on a never ending hunt for
hilde-through-the-looking-glass, could she?

...the path of mystery leads inwards...
hilde let the heavy ring binder slide into her lap. then she let it slide further onto the 
floor.
it was already lighter in the room than when she had gone to bed.

had begun to write about little
red ridinghood and winnie-the-pooh ...
she slept until eleven o'clock the next morning. the tension in her body told her that
she had dreamed intensely all night, but she could not remember what she had
dreamed. it felt as if she had been in a totally different reality.
she went downstairs and fixed breakfast. her mother had put on her blue jumpsuit
ready to go down to the boathouse and work on the motorboat. even if it was not
afloat, it had to be shipshape when dad got back from lebanon.
"do you want to come down and give me a hand?"
"i have to read a little first. should i come down with some tea and a mid-morning
snack?"
"what mid-morning?"
when hilde had eaten she went back up to her room, made her bed, and sat herself
comfortably with the ring binder resting against her knees.

sophie slipped through the hedge and stood in the big garden which she had once
thought of as her own garden of eden . . .

wiches.
she had made up her mind to play a few tricks on her father. hilde was beginning to
feel more and more allied with sophie and alberto. her plan would start when he got
to copenhagen.
she went down to the boathouse with a large tray.
"here's our brunch," she said.
her mother was holding a block wrapped in sandpaper. she pushed a stray lock of
hair back from her forehead. there was sand in her hair too.
"let's drop dinner, then."
they sat down outside on the dock and began to eat.
"when's dad arriving?" asked hilde after a while.
"on saturday. i thought you knew that."
"but what time? didn't you say he was changing planes in copenhagen?"
"that's right.
her mother took a bite of her sandwich.
"he gets to copenhagen at about five. the plane to kristiansand leaves at a quarter to
eight. he'll probably land at kjevik at half-past nine."
"so he has a few hours at kastrup ..."
"yes, why?" 
"nothing. i was just wondering."
when hilde thought a suitable interval had elapsed, she said casual

"they call from time to time. they are coming home on vacation sometime in july."
"not before?"
"no, i don't think so."
"so they'll be in copenhagen this week... ?"
"why all these questions, hilde?"
"no reason. just small talk."
"you mentioned copenhagen twice."
"i did?"
"we talked about dad touching down in ..."
"that's probably why i thought of anne and ole."
as soon as they finished eating, hilde collected the mugs and plates on the tray.
"i have to get on with my reading, mom."
"i guess you must."
was there a touch of reproach in her voice? they had talked about fixing up the boat
together before dad came home.
"dad almost made me promise to finish the book before he got home."
"it's a little crazy. when he's away, he doesn't have to order us around back home."

r her father were quite sure of.
but one thing was certain: before her father got home to bjerkely he would get a scare.
that was the least she could do for sophie and alberto, especially after they had
appealed for help ...
her mother was still down in the boathouse. hilde ran downstairs to the telephone.
she found anne and ole's number in copenhagen and called them.
"anne kvamsdal."
"hi, this is hilde." 
"oh, how are you? how are things in lillesand?"
 "fine, with vacation and everything. and dad gets back from lebanon in a week."
"won't that be great, hilde!"
"yes, i'm looking forward to it. that's actually why i'm calling..."
"it is?"
"i think he's landing at kastrup around 5 p.m. on saturday the 23rd. will you be in
copenhagen then?"
"i think so."
"i was wondering if you could do something for me."
"why, of course."
"it's kind of a special favor. i'm not even sure if it's possible."
"now you're making me curious ..."
hilde began to describe her plan. she told anne about the ring bind

 down into it. she rowed around the bay with short angry strokes
until she had calmed down.
"we are the living planet, sophie! we are the great vessel sailing around a burning sun
in the universe. but each and every of us is also a ship sailing through life with a
cargo of genes. when we have carried this cargo safely to the next harbor--we have
not lived in vain..."
she knew the passage by heart. it had been written for her. not for sophie, for her.
every word in the ring binder was written by dad to hilde.
she rested the oars in the oarlocks and drew them in. the boat rocked gently on the
water, the ripples slapping softly against the prow.
and like the little rowboat floating on the surface in the bay at lillesand, she herself
was just a nutshell on the surface of life.
where were sophie and alberto in this picture? yes, where were alberto and sophie?
she could not fathom that they were no more than "electromagnetic impulses" in her
father's brain. she could not fathom, and certainly n

over our rosebeds. surely it can't be necessary to demonstrate in a garden. let's hurry
home and see."
"it was a philosophical demonstration, mom. real philosophers don't trample on
rosebeds."
"i'll tell you what, sophie. i don't think i believe in real philosophers any longer.
everything is synthetic nowadays."
they spent the afternoon and evening preparing. they continued the next morning,
setting and decorating the table. joanna came over to give them a hand.
"good grief!" she said, "mom and dad are coming too. it's your fault, sophie!" 
everything was ready half an hour before the guests were due. the trees were
festooned with streamers and japanese lanterns. the garden gate, the trees lining the
path, and the front of the house were hung with balloons. sophie and joanna had
spent most of the afternoon blowing them up.
the table was set with chicken, salad, and different kinds of homemade bread. in the
kitchen there were raisin buns and layer cake, danish pastry and chocolate cake. bu

 to contact the sas information desk."
what now? he felt a chill down his spine. surely he was not being ordered back to
lebanon? could something be wrong at home?
he quickly reached the sas information desk.
"i'm albert knag."
"here is a message for you. it is urgent."
he opened the envelope at once. inside lay a smaller envelope. it was addressed to
major albert knag, c/o sas information, kastrup airport, copenhagen.
albert opened the little envelope nervously. it contained a short note:
dear dad, welcome home from lebanon. as you can imagine, i can't even wait till
you get home. forgive me for having you paged over the loud-speakers. it was the
easiest way.
p.s. unfortunately a claim for damages has arrived from financial adviser
ingebrigtsen regarding a stolen and wrecked mercedes.
p.s. p.s. i may be sitting in the garden when you get here. but you might also be

 of his own life. now
this little vixen in lillesand was directing his movements in kastrup airport! how
had she managed that?
he put the envelope in his breast pocket and began to stroll toward the little shopping
mall. he was just about to enter the danish food deli when he noticed a small
envelope taped to the store window. it had major knag written on it with a thick
marker pen. albert took it down and opened it:
personal message for major albert knag, c/o danish food, kastrup airport. dear
dad, please buy a large danish salami, preferably a two-pound one, and mom would
probably like a cognac sausage. p. s. danish caviar is not bad either. love, hilde.
albert turned around. she wasn't here, was she? had mark given her a trip to
copenhagen so she could meet him here? it was hilde's handwriting ...
suddenly the un observer began to feel himself observed. it was as if someone was
in remote control of everything he did. he felt like a doll in the hands of a child.
he went into the shop an

ought a two-pound salami, a cognac sausage, and three
jars of danish caviar. then he continued down the row of stores. he had made up his
mind to buy a proper present for hilde. a calculator, maybe? or a little radio--yes,
that was what he would get.
when he got to the store that sold electrical appliances, he saw that there was an
envelope taped to the window there too. this one was addressed to "major albert
knag, c/o the most interesting store in kastrup." inside was the following note:
dear dad, sophie sends her greetings and thanks for the combined mini-tv and fm
radio that she got for her birthday from her very generous father. it was great, but on
the other hand it was a mere bagatelle. i must confess, though, that i share sophie's
liking for such bagatelles. p.s. in case you haven't been there yet, there are further
instructions at the danish food store and the big tax free store that sells wines and 
tobacco. p.s. p.s. i got some money for my birthday, so i can contribute to the

to the cinderella cafeteria and the red convertible.
right next to the car a busy mother was helping her little boy to pee.
racing along and taking shortcuts, they soon arrived in lillesand.
sk 876 from copenhagen touched down at kjevik on schedule at 9:35 p.m. while the
plane was taxied out to the runway in copenhagen, the.major had opened the
envelope hanging from the check-in desk. the note inside read:
to major knag, as he hands over his boarding pass at kastrup on midsummer eve,
1990. dear dad, you probably thought i would turn up in copenhagen. but my
control over your movements is more ingenious than that. i can see you wherever you
are, dad. the fact is, i have been to visit a well-known gypsy family which many,
many years ago sold a magic brass mirror to great-grandmother. i have also gotten
myself a crystal ball. at this very moment, i can see that you have just sat down in
your seat. may i remind you to fasten your seat belt and keep the back of your seat

with a significant difference,
surely. his medicine had first and foremost affected sophie and alberto. and
they--well, they were only imaginary.
he did what hilde had suggested. he lowered the back of his seat and nodded off. he
was not fully awake again until he had gone through passport control and was
standing in the arrival hall at kjevik airport. a demonstration was there to greet him.
there were eight or ten young people of about hilde's age. they were holding signs
saying:
welcome home, dad -- hilde is waiting in the garden -- irony
lives.
the worst thing was that he could not just jump into a taxi. he had to wait for his
baggage. and all the while, hilde's classmates were swarming around him, forcing
him to read the signs again and again. then one of the girls came up and gave him a
bunch of roses and he melted. he dug down into one of his shopping bags and gave
each demonstrator a marzipan bar. now there were only two left for hilde. when he
had reclaimed his baggage, a young ma

n stepped forward and explained that he was
under the command of the queen of the mirror, and that he had orders to drive him to
bjerkely. the other demonstrators dispersed into the crowd.
they drove out onto the e 18. every bridge and tunnel they passed was draped with
banners saying: "welcome home!", "the turkey is ready," "i can see you, dad!"
when he was dropped off outside the gate at bjerkely, albert knag heaved a sigh of
relief, and thanked the driver with a hundred crown note and three cans of carlsberg
elephant beer.
his wife was waiting for him outside the house. after a long embrace, he asked:
"where is she?"
"she's sitting on the dock, albert."
alberto and sophie stopped the red convertible on the square in lillesand outside the
hotel norge. it was a quarter past ten. they could see a large bonfire out in the
archipelago.

d write a
mysterious book for her-- and then everything would remain as before?
she looked at her watch again. now it was a quarter past ten. he could be arriving
any minute.
but what was that? she thought she heard a faint breath of something, exactly as in
her dream about sophie.
she turned around quickly. there was something, she was sure of it. but what?
maybe it was only the summer night.
for a few seconds she was afraid she was hearing things.
"hilde!"
now she turned the other way. it was dad! he was standing at the top of the garden.
hilde jumped up and ran toward him. they met by the glider. he lifted her up in the
air and swung her around and around.
hilde was crying, and her father had to hold back his tears as well.
"you've become a grown woman, hilde!"
"and you've become a real writer."
hilde wiped away her tears. 
"shall we say we're quits?" she asked.
"we're quits."
they sat down at the table. first of all hilde had to have an exact description of
everything that had happene

d at kastrup and on the way home. they kept bursting out
laughing.
"didn't you see the envelope in the cafeteria?"
"i didn't get a chance to sit down and eat anything, you villain. now i'm ravenous."
"poor dad."
"the stuff about the turkey was all bluff, then?"
"it certainly was not! i have prepared everything. mom's doing the serving."
then they had to go over the ring binder and the story of sophie and alberto from one
end to the other and backwards and forwards.
mom brought out the turkey and the waldorf salad, the rose wine and hilde's
homemade bread.
her father was just saying something about plato when hilde suddenly interrupted
him: "shh!"
"what is it?"
"didn't you hear it? something squeaking

"only the two of us and the cool summer night."
"no, there's something in the air."
"and what might that be?"
"you remember alberto and his secret plan?"
"how could i forget!"
"they simply disappeared from the garden party. it was as if they had vanished into
thin air . . ."
"yes, but..."
"... into thin air."
"the story had to end somewhere. it was just something i wrote."
"that was, yes, but not what happened afterward. suppose they were here . . ."
"do you believe that?"
"i can feel it, dad." 
sophie ran back to the car.
"impressive," said alberto grudgingly as she climbed on board clasping the wrench
tightly in her hand. "you have unusual talents, sophie. just wait and see."
the major put his arm around hilde.
"do you hear the mysterious play of the waves?"
"yes. we must get the boat in the water tomorrow."
"but do you hear the strange whispering of the wind? look how the aspen leaves are
trembling."
"the planet is alive, you know ..."
"you wrote that there was something between

"did you?"
"it reminds me of when sophie borrowed alberto's boat. do you remember how it lay
drifting out in the lake?"
"i bet it's her at work again."
"go ahead and make fun of me. all evening, i've been able to feel someone here."
"one of us will have to swim out to it."
"we'll both go, dad."
