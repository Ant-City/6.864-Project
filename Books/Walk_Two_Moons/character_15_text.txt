 your mother. come along, then.' her voice was rather too sugary and
sweet, as if she was speaking to tiny children who had asked to go to the
toilet.

   we followed her to a little room with glass partitions. an enormous man
with a huge head and neck, and massive shoulders, sat behind the desk. his
hair was bright red and his face was covered in freckles he did not smile
when we entered. after the woman repeated what we had told her, he stared
at us for a long time.


   he said his name was sergeant bickle, and phoebe told him her name.
then, she told him everything. she explained about her mother's
disappearing and about the note from mrs. cadaver, and then about mrs.
cadaver's missing husband and the rhododendron bush, and finally about the
lunatic and the mysterious messages. at this point, sergeant pickle said,
'what sort of messages?'

   phoebe was prepared. she pulled them out of her book-bag and laid them
on the desk in the order in which they had arrived. he read each one aloud:

everyone has his own agenda.

in the course of a lifetime, what does it matter?
you can 't keep the birds of sadness from flying

over your head, but you can keep them

from nesting in your hair.


   sergeant bickle looked up at the woman seated next to us, and the corners
of his mouth twitched slightly. to phoebe, he said, 'how do you think these
are related to your mother's disappearance?'

   'i don't know,' she said. 'that's what i want you to find out.'

   sergeant pickle asked phoebe to spell cadaver's name.  'it means corpse,'
phoebe 'dead body.

   'i know. is there anything else you would like to show me?'

   phoebe pulled out the envelope with the unidentifiable hair strands.

   'perhaps you c

   sergeant bickle looked at the woman, and again the corners of his mouth
twitched slightly. the woman removed her glasses and wiped the lenses

   they were not taking us seriously, and i felt my 'ornery donkey-self
waking up. i mentioned the potential blood spots that phoebe had marked
with adhesive tape.


   'but, my father removed the tape,' phoebe said. sergeant bickle said,
'well, thank you very much, miss winterbottom and miss--?'

   'hiddle,' i said. 'salamanca hiddle.'

   'miss winterbottom and miss hiddle, i wonder if you would excuse me a
few minutes? would you mind waiting here?' to the woman, he said, 'why
don't you stay with these young ladies?'

   so, we sat there with the woman. she asked phoebe mrs. said. about
school and about her father and her mother and her sister. she had an awful
lot of questions i kept wondering where sergeant bickle had

 gone and when
he was coming back. he was gone for over an hour. there were three
framed pictures on sergeant bickle's desk, and i tried to lean forward to see
them, but i couldn't. i was afraid the woman would think i was nosy. phoebe
asked the woman if she might try on her glasses. the woman handed them to
phoebe.

   'goodness!' phoebe said. 'the world must look very different to you than it
does to me.

   'yes' she said, 'i suppose it does.'

   'i am certainly glad that i can see normally,' phoebe said.

   sergeant bickle finally returned. behind him was phoebe's father. phoebe
looked extensively relie

ved, but i knew it was not a coincidence that her
father had come to the police while we were there as well.

   'miss winterbottom,' sergeant bickle said, 'your father is going to take
you and miss hiddle home now.

   'but--' phoebe said.

   'mr. winterbottom, we'll be in touch. and, remember, if you would like
me to speak with mrs. cadaver--

   'oh, no,' mr. winterbottom said. he looked embarrassed. 'really, that
won't be necessary. i do apologize.


   we followed mr. winterbottom outside. in the car he said nothing. i
thought he might drop me off at my house, but he did not. when we got to
their house, the only thing he said was 'pho

will recall, about men's bathing suits being more comfortable than women's
and...' on and on she went.

   mary lou was trying to get across the room to alex, who was standing
there as pink as can be. 'alex!' she called. 'wait! i wrote that before - wait...

   it was a jing-bang of a mess. i was glad i had to get out of there. phoebe
and i were going to the police again.

   our visit to the police was quick. we got in to see sergeant bickle right
away. phoebe slapped the newest message about the water in the well onto
his desk, dumped the hairs which she had collected at mrs. cadaver's house
on top of the message, and then placed her list of' further items to
investigate' on top of that.

   sergeant bickle frowned. 'i don't think you girls understand. why don't
you take these things home and do something wholesome, like run around
the block or play a game of tennis?'

   phoebe went into a rage. 'you idiot,' she said. she scooped

 up the message,
the hairs, and her list and ran out of the office.


   sergeant bickle glanced at me and followed her. i waited, thinking he
would bring phoebe back and calm her down. i looked at the photographs on
his desk, the ones i had not been able to see the day before. in one was
sergeant bickle and a friendly looking woman - his wife, i supposed. the
second picture was of a shiny black car. the third picture was of sergeant
bickle, the woman, and a young man - their son, i figured. i looked closer.

   i recognized the son. it was the lunatic.

   gramps barrelled through wyoming like a house on fire. we snaked
through winding roads where the trees leaned close, rustling, rush, rush,
rush. the road curved alongside rivers that rolled and gabbled, h

   'hell's bells,' gramps said. 'he wasn't worth killing.'

   'maybe not,' gram said, 'but gloria was'

   'oh, yes' gramps said, placing his hand on his heart and pretending to
swoon, 'gloria!'

   'cut that out,' gram said. she rolled over on her side and said to me, 'tell
me about peeby. tell me that story, but don't make it too awfully sad.' she
folded her hands on her chest. 'tell me what happened with the lunatic.'

   when i saw the picture of the lunatic on sergeant bickle's desk, i tore out
of that office faster than lightning. i ran past sergeant bickle standing in the
parking lot. there was no sign of phoebe. i ran all the way to her house. as i
was passing mrs. cadaver's house, mrs. partridge called to me from her
porch.

   i stopped. 'you look all dressed up,' i said. 'are you going somewhere?'

   'oh, yes' she said. 'i'm redible.

   'you mean "ready"?'


   'yes redible as can be.' she tottered down the steps swinging her cobra
cane in front of her.

have kidnapped or murdered her.

   after mr. birkway left, phoebe and i sat on the front porch. phoebe said,
'if mrs. cadaver didn't kidnap or murder my mother, then where is she?
what can i do? where should i look?'

   'phoebe,' i said. 'there's something i've got to tell you.'

   'look, sal, if you're going to tell me she's not coming back, i don't want to
hear it. you might as well go home now. you might as well--'


   'no, phoebe, that isn't it. i know who the lunatic is. it's sergeant bickle's
son.

   and so we devised a plan.

   at home that night, all i could think about was mrs. cadaver. i could see
her in her white uniform, working in the emergency room. i could see an
ambulance pulling up with its blue lights flashing, and i could see her
walking briskly to the swinging doors, with her wild hair all around her face.
i could see the stretchers being wheeled in through the doorway and i could
see mrs. cadaver looking down at them.

   i could feel her heart thumping like mad a

she might
sleep, especially after staring awake all night, but she didn't. she wanted to
hear about peeby. so all day long, as i took in the scenery, and as i imagined
us in a thousand accidents and as i prayed underneath it all to any tree
whizzing by, i talked about peeby. i wanted to tell it all today. i wanted to
finish it.

   on the day after mr. birkway appeared at phoebe's house and told us
about mr. cadaver, phoebe and i were going to put our plan in motion. we
were going to track down sergeant bickle's son and, according to phoebe,
discover the whereabouts of phoebe's mother. i wasn't positive that sergeant
bickle's son was a lunatic, and i wasn't convinced he would lead us to
phoebe's mother, but enough of phoebe's tales had been transplanted into my
brain so that i was caught up in the plan. like phoebe, i was ready to take
some action.

   we could hardly sit still all day at school. phoebe, especially, was fired up.
she was worried, too. she was afraid we might not discover her mother

i got home, my father was pacing around the kitchen. 'where were
you? why didn't you leave a note?' he wanted me to go to margaret
cadaver's with him for dinner. 'i can't.' i said. 'i have tons of home- work,
and i'll never get it done and--'

   he was disappointed. 'i guess i'll stay home then,' he said.

   'no. you go ahead. really. i want you to. i'll heat up the leftover spaghetti.
really. i'll come: with you next time. i promise.'

   at seven o'clock, i phoned the bickles. i prayed that sergeant bickle
wouldn't answer, but i was prepared to disguise my voice in case he did. the
phone rang and rang. i hung up. i rehearsed my voice and what i would say.
i tried again. on the seventh ring, the phone was answered. it was sergeant
bickle.

   'my name is susan longfellow,' i said. 'i'm a friend of your son's'

   'oh?' he said.

   'i was wondering if i might speak with him,' i prayed and prayed that he
had only one son.

   'he isn't here,' sergeant bickle said. 'would you like to leave a message

en he might be home?'

   there was a pause. 'how did you say you know my son?' he asked.

   this made me nervous. 'how do i know your son? well, that's a long story
- i - basically, the way i know him is - actually, this is a little embarrassing
to admit'- my hands were sweating so much i could hardly hang onto the
phone - 'the library, yes, actually, i know him from the library, and he loaned
me a book, but i've lost the book, and i wanted to-'

   'maybe you should explain this all to him,' sergeant bickle said.


   'yes, maybe i should do that.'

   'i wonder why he gave you this phone number,' he said. 'i wonder why he
didn't give you his number at school.'

   'at school? 'actually, the thing is, i think he did give me that number too,
but i've lost it.

   'you sure lose a lot of things.' he said.

   'yes that's me, a real scatter-brain. i---

   'would you like his number at school?'

   'yes.' i said. 'or, better yet, maybe you could give me his address and i'll
just send him the book.

   'i thought you said you lost the book.

   'actually yes, but i'm hoping to find it,' i said.

   'i see,' he said. 'just a minute.' there was a muffled pause as he put his
hand over the receiver and called, 'honey, where's mike's address?'

   mike! brilliant! a name! i felt like the chief inspector! i felt like i had
just discovered the most important clue in the criminal investigation of the
century. to top it off, sergeant bickle gave me mike's address i was sorely
tempted to end the conversation by informing sergeant bickle that his son
was a potential lunatic, but i refrained. i thanked him and immediately
phoned phoebe.

   'you're brilliant!' she said. 'tomorrow we'll nail mike the lunatic.'


37. the visit


   the next day, saturday, when phoebe and i reached the bus stop, ben was
standing there. 'oh, crud,' phoebe muttered. 'are you waiting for this bus?
are you going to chanting falls?'

   'yup,' he said.
