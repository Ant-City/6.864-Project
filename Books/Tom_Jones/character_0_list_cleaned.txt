 - 
                tom jones, a "bastard" raised by the philanthropic allworthy, is the novel's 
eponymous hero and protagonist. although tom's faults (namely, his imprudence 
and his lack of chastity) prevent him from being a perfect hero, his good heart 
and generosity make him fielding's avatar of virtue, along with allworthy. tom's 
handsome face and gallantry win him the love and affection of women throughout 
the countryside. his dignified, though natural air induces characters to assume 
that he is a gentleman--which ultimately turns out to be true.
