“yes, so i imagined. i was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of miss fairfax to-day.”
“so obliging of you! no, we should not have heard, if it had not been for this particular circumstance, of her being to come here so soon. my mother is so delighted!—for she is to be three months with us at least. three months, she says so, positively, as i am going to have the pleasure of reading to you. the case is, you see, that the campbells are going to ireland. mrs. dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly. they had not intended to go over till the summer, but she is so impatient to see them again—for till she married, last october, she was never away from them so much as a week, which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms, i was going to say, but however different countries, and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother—or her father, i declare i do not know which it was, but we shall see presently in

 jane’s letter—wrote in mr. dixon’s name as well as her own, to press their coming over directly, and they would give them the meeting in dublin, and take them back to their country seat, baly-craig, a beautiful place, i fancy. jane has heard a great deal of its beauty; from mr. dixon, i mean—i do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else; but it was very natural, you know, that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses—and as jane used to be very often walking out with them—for colonel and mrs. campbell were very particular about their daughter’s not walking out often with only mr. dixon, for which i do not at all blame them; of course she heard every thing he might be telling miss campbell about his own home in irelan

at this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering emma’s brain with regard to jane fairfax, this charming mr. dixon, and the not going to ireland, she said, with the insidious design of farther discovery,
“you must feel it very fortunate that miss fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time. considering the very particular friendship between her and mrs. dixon, you could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying colonel and mrs. campbell.”

“but, in spite of all her friends’ urgency, and her own wish of seeing ireland, miss fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and mrs. bates?”
“yes—entirely her own doing, entirely her own choice; and colonel and mrs. campbell think she does quite right, just what they should recommend; and indeed they particularly wish her to try her native air, as she has not been quite so well as usual lately.”
“i am concerned to hear of it. i think they judge wisely. but mrs. dixon must be

 very much disappointed. mrs. dixon, i understand, has no remarkable degree of personal beauty; is not, by any means, to be compared with miss fairfax.”
“oh! no. you are very obliging to say such things—but certainly not. there is no comparison between them. miss campbell always was absolutely plain—but extremely elegant and amiable.”
“yes, that of course.”
“jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th of november, (as i am going to read to you,) and has never been well since. a long time, is not it,

 the circumstance of jane’s decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements. that nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents. they continued together with unabated regard however, till the marriage of miss campbell, who by that chance, that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs, giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior, engaged the affections of mr. dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable, almost as soon as they were acquainted; and was eligibly and happily settled, while jane fairfax had yet her bread to earn.
this event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning. she had long resolved that one-and-twenty should be the period. with the fortitude of a devoted novitia

if any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more reserved on the subject of weymouth and the dixons than any thing. she seemed bent on giving no real insight into mr. dixon’s character, or her own value for his company, or opinion of the suitableness of the match. it was all general approbation and smoothness; nothing delineated or distinguished. it did her no service however. her caution was thrown away. emma saw its artifice, and returned to her first surmises. there probably was something more to conceal than her own preference; mr. dixon, perhaps, had been very near changing one friend

“quite wrong, my dear aunt; there is no likeness at all.”
“very odd! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand. one takes up a notion, and runs away with it. mr. dixon, you say, is not, strictly speaking, handsome?”

“proof indeed!” said emma, highly amused.—“mr. dixon is very musical, is he? we shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from you, than miss fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year.”
“yes, mr. dixon and miss campbell were the persons; and i thought it a very strong proof.”
“certainly—very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal stronger than, if i had been miss campbell, would have been at all agreeable to me. i could not excuse a man’s having more music than love—more ear than eye—a more acute sensibility to fi

ne sounds than to my feelings. how did miss campbell appear to like it?”
“it was her very particular friend, you know.”
“poor comfort!” said emma, laughing. “one would rather have a stranger preferred than one’s very particular friend—with a stranger it might not recur again—but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself!—poor mrs. dixon! well, i am glad she is gone to settle in ireland.”
“you are right. it was not very flattering to miss campbell; but she really did not seem to feel it.”
“so much the better—or so much the worse:—i do not know which. but be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her—quickness of friendship, or dulness of feeling—there was one person, i think, who must have felt it: miss fairfax herself. she must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction.”

“there appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all—” he began rather quickly, but checking himself, added, “however, it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were—how it might all be behind the scenes. i can only say that there was smoothness outwardly. but you, who have known miss fairfax from a child, must be a better judge of her character, and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations, than i c

“you may say what you chuse—but your countenance testifies that your thoughts on this subject are very much like mine.”
“i do not know. i rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than i deserve. i smile because you smile, and shall probably suspect whatever i find you suspect; but at present i do not see what there is to question. if colonel campbell is not the person, who can be?”
“what do you say to mrs. dixon?”
“mrs. dixon! very true indeed. i had not thought of mrs. dixon. she must know as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument would be; and perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize, is more like a young woman’s scheme than an elderly man’s. it is mrs. dixon, i dare say. i told you that your suspicions would guide mine.”

“yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which i had entertained before.—i do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either mr. dixon or miss fairfax, but i cannot help suspecting either that, after making his proposals to her friend, he had the misfortune to fall in love with her, or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side. one might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right; but i am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to highbury instead of going with the campbells to ireland. here, she must be leading a life of privation and penance; there it would have been all e

“and, upon my word, they have an air of great probability. mr. dixon’s preference of her music to her friend’s, i can answer for being very decided.”
“and then, he saved her life. did you ever hear of that?—a water party; and by some accident she was falling overboard. he caught her.”
“he did. i was there—one of the party.”

“the arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me. i wanted to know a little more, and this tells me quite enough. depend upon it, we shall soon hear that it is a present from mr. and mrs. dixon.”
“and if the dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the campbells.”
“no, i am sure it is not from the campbells. miss fairfax knows it is not from the campbells, or they would have been guessed at first. she would not have been puzzled, had she dared fix on them. i may not have convinced you perhaps, but i am perfectly convinced myself that mr. dixon is a principal in the business.”

there was no occasion to press the matter farther. the conviction seemed real; he looked as if he felt it. she said no more, other subjects took their turn; and the rest of the dinner passed away; the dessert succeeded, the children came in, and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation; a few clever things said, a fe

“poor jane fairfax!”—thought emma.—“you have not deserved this. you may have done wrong with regard to mr. dixon, but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited!—the kindness and protection of mrs. elton!—‘jane fairfax and jane fairfax.’ heavens! let me not suppose that she dares go about, emma woodhouse-ing me!—but upon my honour, there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman’s tongue!”

jane had come to highbury professedly for three months; the campbells were gone to ireland for three months; but now the campbells had promised their daughter to stay at least till midsummer, and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there. according to miss bates—it all came from her—mrs. dixon had written most pressingly. would jane but go, means were to be found, servants sent, friends contrived—no travelling difficulty allowed to exist; but still she had declined it!
“she must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing this invitation,” was emma’s conclusion. “she must be under some sort of penance, inflicted either by the campbells or herself. there is great fear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.—she is not to be with the dixons. the decree is

it was done however. this gallant young man, who seemed to love without feeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance, directly handed over the word to miss fairfax, and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it. mr. knightley’s excessive curiosity to know what this word might be, made him seize every possible moment for darting his eye towards it, and it was not long before he saw it to be dixon. jane fairfax’s perception seemed to accompany his; her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning, the superior intelligence, of those five letters so arranged. she was evidently displeased; looked up, and seeing herself watched, blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her, and saying only, “i did not know that proper names were allowed,” pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit, and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered. h

“ah! miss woodhouse, how kind you are!—i suppose you have heard—and are come to give us joy. this does not seem much like joy, indeed, in me—(twinkling away a tear or two)—but it will be very trying for us to part with her, after having had her so long, and she has a dreadful headache just now, writing all the morning:—such long letters, you know, to be written to colonel campbell, and mrs. dixon. ‘my dear,’ said i, ‘you will blind yourself’—for tears were in her eyes perpetually. one cannot wonder, one cannot wonder. it is a great change; and though she is amazingly fortunate—such a situation, i suppose, as no young woman before ever met with on first going out—do not think us ungrateful, miss woodhouse, for such surprising good fortune—(again dispersing her tears)—but, poor dear soul! if you were to see what a headache she has. when one is in great pain, you know one

“and do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresy?—the campbells, the dixons, did none of them know of the engagement?”
emma could not speak the name of dixon without a little blush.
“none; not one. he positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves.”
“well,” said emma, “i suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea, and i wish them very happy. but i shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding. what has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit,—espionage, and treachery?—to come among us

he thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.
“is not she looking well?” said he, turning his eyes towards jane. “better than she ever used to do?—you see how my father and mrs. weston doat upon her.”
but his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes, after mentioning the expected return of the campbells, he named the name of dixon.—emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing.
“i can never think of it,” she cried, “without extreme shame.”
“the shame,” he answered, “is all mine, or ought to be. but is it possible that you had no suspicion?—i mean of late. early, i know, you had none.”
“i never had the smallest, i assure you.”
“that appears quite wonderful. i was once very near—and i wish i had—it would have been better. but though i was always doing wrong things, they were ve
