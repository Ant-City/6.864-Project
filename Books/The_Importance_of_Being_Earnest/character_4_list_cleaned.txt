[CHARACTER] - 
                algernon's
snobbish, mercenary, and domineering aunt and gwendolen's mother.
[CHARACTER] married well, and her primary goal in life is to
see her daughter do the same. she has a list of "eligible young
men" and a prepared interview she gives to potential suitors. like her
nephew, [CHARACTER] is given to making hilarious pronouncements,
but where algernon means to be witty, the humor in [CHARACTER]'s
speeches is unintentional. through the figure of [CHARACTER], wilde
manages to satirize the hypocrisy and stupidity of the british aristocracy.
[CHARACTER] values ignorance, which she sees as "a delicate exotic
fruit." when she gives a dinner party, she prefers her husband to
eat downstairs with the servants. she is cunning, narrow-minded,
authoritarian, and possibly the most quotable character in the play.
