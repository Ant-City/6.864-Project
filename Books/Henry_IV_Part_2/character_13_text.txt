d harry monmouth's brawn, the hulk sir john,
    is prisoner to your son. o, such a day,
    so fought, so followed, and so fairly won,
    came not till now to dignify the times,
    since cxsar's fortunes!
  northumberland. how is this deriv'd?
    saw you the field? came you from shrewsbury?
  lord bardolph. i spake with one, my lord, that came from
thence;
    a gentleman well bred and of good name,
    that freely rend'red me these news for true.

                         enter travers

  northumberland. here comes my servant travers, whom i sent
    on tuesday last to listen after news.
  lord bardolph. my lord, i over-rode him on the way;
    and he is furnish'd with no certainties
    more than he haply may retail from me.
  northumberland. now, travers, what good tidings comes with you?
  travers. my lord, sir john umfrevile turn'd me back
    with joyful tidings; and, being better hors'd,
    out-rode me. after him came spurring hard
    a gentleman, almost fo

up to the rowel-head; and starting so,
    he seem'd in running to devour the way,
    staying no longer question.
  northumberland. ha! again:
    said he young harry percy's spur was cold?
    of hotspur, coldspur? that rebellion
    had met ill luck?
  lord bardolph. my lord, i'll tell you what:
    if my young lord your son have not the day,
    upon mine honour, for a silken point
    i'll give my barony. never talk of it.
  northumberland. why should that gentleman that rode by travers
    give then such instances of loss?
  lord bardolph. who- he?
    he was some hilding fellow that had stol'n
    the horse he rode on and, upon my life,
    spoke at a venture. look, here comes more news.

                        enter morton

  northumberland. yea, this man's brow, like to a title-leaf,
    foretells the nature of a tragic volume.
    so looks the strand whereon the imperious flood
    hath left a witness'd usurpation.
    say, morton, didst thou come from shrew

    and this same half-fac'd fellow, shadow- give me this man. he
    presents no mark to the enemy; the foeman may with as great
aim
    level at the edge of a penknife. and, for a retreat- how
swiftly
    will this feeble, the woman's tailor, run off! o, give me the
    spare men, and spare me the great ones. put me a caliver into
    wart's hand, bardolph.
  bardolph. hold, wart. traverse- thus, thus, thus.
  falstaff. come, manage me your caliver. so- very well. go to;
very
    good; exceeding good. o, give me always a little, lean, old,
