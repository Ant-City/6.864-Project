 gentleman?” she gasped, confounded,
stupefied: “a gentleman he?”

“you know him then?”

she visibly tried to hold herself. “but he is handsome?”

i saw the way to help her. “remarkably!”

“and dressed--?”

“in somebody’s clothes.” “they’re smart, but they’re not his own.”

she broke into a breathless affirmative groan: “they’re the master’s!”

i caught it up. “you do know him?”

she faltered but a second. “quint!” she cried.

“quint?”

“peter quint--his own man, his valet, when he was here!”

“when the master was?”

gaping still, but meeting me, she pieced it all together. “he never wore
his hat, but he did wear--well, there were waistcoats missed. they were
both here--last year. then the master went, and quint was alone.”

i followed, but halting a little. “alone?”

“alone with us.” then, as from a deeper depth, “in charge,” she added.

“and what became of him?”

she hung fire so long that i was still more mysti

indeed, in retrospect, that by the time the morrow’s sun was high i had
restlessly read into the fact before us almost all the meaning they were
to receive from subsequent and more cruel occurrences. what they gave me
above all was just the sinister figure of the living man--the dead one
would keep awhile!--and of the months he had continuously passed at bly,
which, added up, made a formidable stretch. the limit of this evil time
had arrived only when, on the dawn of a winter’s morning, peter quint
was found, by a laborer going to early work, stone dead on the road
from the village: a catastrophe explained--superficially at least--by a
visible wound to his head; such a wound as might have been produced--and
as, on the final evidence, had been--by a fatal slip, in the dark and
after leaving the public house, on the steepish icy slope, a wrong
path altogether, at the bottom of which he lay. the icy slope, the turn
mistaken at night and in liquor, accounted for much--practically, in
the end

my sense of how he received this suffered for a minute from something
that i can describe only as a fierce split of my attention--a stroke
that at first, as i sprang straight up, reduced me to the mere blind
movement of getting hold of him, drawing him close, and, while i just
fell for support against the nearest piece of furniture, instinctively
keeping him with his back to the window. the appearance was full upon us
that i had already had to deal with here: peter quint had come into view
like a sentinel before a prison. the next thing i saw was that, from
outside, he had reached the window, and then i knew that, close to the
glass and glaring in through it, he offered once more to the room his
white face of damnation. it represents but grossly what took place
within me at the sight to say that on the second my decision was made;
yet i believe that no woman so overwhelmed ever in so short a time
recovered her grasp of the act. it came to me in the very horror

 last time!”

at this, after a second in which his head made the movement of a baffled
dog’s on a scent and then gave a frantic little shake for air and light,
he was at me in a white rage, bewildered, glaring vainly over the place
and missing wholly, though it now, to my sense, filled the room like the
taste of poison, the wide, overwhelming presence. “it’s he?”

i was so determined to have all my proof that i flashed into ice to
challenge him. “whom do you mean by ‘he’?”

“peter quint--you devil!” his face gave again, round the room, its
convulsed supplication. “where?”

they are in my ears still, his supreme surrender of the name and his
tribute to my devotion. “what does he matter now, my own?--what will he
ever matter? _i_ have you,” i launched at the beast, “but he has lost
you forever!” then, for the demonstration of my work, “there, there!” i
said to miles.

but he had already jerked straight round, stared, glared again, and
seen but the quiet day. wi
