[CHARACTER]
in many ways, [CHARACTER] is gilman's ideal woman. beautiful and athletic, an
unusual combination in the literature of gilman's time, [CHARACTER] defies the
frail, delicate victorian feminine ideal without seeming in any way masculinized
or unwomanly. she is intelligent, courageous, and curious about the larger
world. she is also a career woman: her work as a forester is inspired by the
praise she received as a child for helping destroy an insect pest that
threatened herland's trees. all of these aspects combine to make
[CHARACTER] a walking rebuke to the stereotype of the modern, "liberated" woman
as a waspish, unfulfilled man-hater. gilman means for [CHARACTER] to
exemplify woman's human potential--that is, woman's potential
for wholeness, beyond the conventional boundaries of traditional femininity.
given the chance, gilman is saying, women can be like [CHARACTER]: equal to a man
spiritually, intellectually, and even physically.

[CHARACTER]'s mission to the outside world is part of her quest for an
understanding of human nature in its wholeness. [CHARACTER] senses that, despite the
amazing progress made in herland, their society remains incomplete as long as
there is no contribution from the masculine half of humanity. [CHARACTER] is driven
to understand the masculine "other" both through her romantic relationship with
van and, at the end of the novel, by exploring the outside world in his company.
there is still a tentative, unsettled quality to [CHARACTER]'s relationship with van
at the conclusion of the novel, as though both the characters and the author
were still trying to figure out what a truly equal sexual relationship would
look like. in a typically clever reversal of traditional characterization,
gilman has [CHARACTER] in the role of cool rationalist, not seeing the point of
nonprocreative sexuality--while van argues for the emotional, passionate,
romantic (and traditionally "feminine") side of sexuality. if the women of the
future are anything like [CHARACTER], gilman seems to say, many of our traditional
expectations will have to be radically revised.
