[CHARACTER]  - 
                scarlett's
third husband, and a dashing, dangerous adventurer and scoundrel.
expelled from west point and disowned by his prominent charleston
family, rhett becomes an opportunistic blockade-runner during the
war, emerging as one of the only rich southern men in atlanta after
the war. rhett proves himself a loving father and, at times, a caring
husband. though he loves scarlett, his pride prevents him from showing
her his love, and it even leads him to brutality. candid, humorous,
and contemptuous of silly social codes, rhett exposes hypocrisy
wherever he goes. he represents postwar society, a pragmatic, fast-paced world
in which the strong thrive and the weak perish.
