[CHARACTER] - 
an advisor to pope boniface viii, da montefeltro
was promised anticipatory absolution--forgiveness for a sin given
prior to the perpetration of the sin itself. da montefeltro now
suffers in hell, since absolution cannot be gained without repentance
and it is impossible to repent a sin before committing it.
