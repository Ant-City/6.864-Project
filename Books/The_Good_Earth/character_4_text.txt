d his uncle's wife and son would be courteous
enough for the sake of their food and their shelter, then
his thoughts turned more violently than ever to the girl
lotus and he muttered to himself:

'when a man's house is full of wild dogs he must seek
peace elsewhere.'

and all the old fever and pain burned in him and he
was still never satisfied of his love.

now what o-lan had not seen in her simplicity nor the
old man because of the dimness of his age nor ching be-
cause of his friendship, the wife of wang lung's uncle
saw at once and she cried out, the laughter slanting from
her eyes:

'now wang lung is seeking to pluck a flower some-
where.' and when o-lan looked at her humbly, not un-
derstanding, she laughed and said again, 'the melon must
always be spilt wide open before you can see the seeds,
eh? well, then, plainly, your man is mad over another
woman!'

this wang lung heard his uncle's wife say in the court
outside his window as he lay dozing and weary in his room
one early morning, exhausted with his

her belly was as great as though with child these three
years, only there was no birth. but she rose at dawn and /

or a pig that would not eat. and she did her work alone
and spoke no more than she could escape speaking with
the wife of wang lung's uncle, and she never spoke at all

courts, and rarely, if lotus came out to walk a little in a
place other than her own court, o-lan went into her room
and sat until one said, 4 she is gone.' and she said nothing
but she worked at her cooking and at the washing at the
pool even in the winter when the water was stiff with ice
to be broken. but wang lung never thought to say:

spare, hire a servant or

said loudly, 'now she will be well yet!'

and the two young persons went up and bowed to her j
and she patted the bed and said: s

'sit here and drink the wine and eat the rice of your i
marriage, for i would see it all and this will be your bed j
of marriage since i am soon to be finished with it and

now none would answer her when she spoke thus but
the two sat down side by side, shy of each other and in
silence, and the wife of wang lung's uncle came in, fat
and important with the occasion, bearing two bowls of hot
wine, and the two drank separately, and then mingled the
wine of the two bowls and drank again, thus signifying that
the two were now one, and they ate rice and mingled the
rice and this signified that their life was now one, and thus
they were wed. then they bowed again to o-lan and to
wang lung and then they went out and together they
bowed to the assembled guests.

then the feasting began and the rooms and the courts
