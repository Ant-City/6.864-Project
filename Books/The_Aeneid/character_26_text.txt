  which troy, the youths the trojan troop, they name.

  thus far the sacred sports they celebrate:
  but fortune soon resum'd her ancient hate;
  for, while they pay the dead his annual dues,
  those envied rites saturnian juno views;
  and sends the goddess of the various bow,
  to try new methods of revenge below;
  supplies the winds to wing her airy way,
  where in the port secure the navy lay.
  swiftly fair iris down her arch descends,
  and, undiscern'd, her fatal voyage ends.
  she saw the gath'ring crowd; and, gliding thence,

  latinus, old and mild, had long possess'd
  the latin scepter, and his people blest:
  his father faunus; a laurentian dame
  his mother; fair marica was her name.
  but faunus came from picus: picus drew
  his birth from saturn, if records be true.
  thus king latinus, in the third degree,
  had saturn author of his family.
  but this old peaceful prince, as heav'n decreed,
  was blest with no male issue to succeed:
  his sons in blooming youth were snatch'd by fate;
  one only daughter heir'd the royal state.

  there kings receiv'd the marks of sov'reign pow'r;
  in state the monarchs march'd; the lictors bore
  their awful axes and the rods before.
  here the tribunal stood, the house of pray'r,
  and here the sacred senators repair;
  all at large tables, in long order set,
  a ram their off'ring, and a ram their meat.
  above the portal, carv'd in cedar wood,
  plac'd in their ranks, their godlike grandsires stood;
  old saturn, with his crooked scythe, on high;
  and italus, that led the colony;
  and ancient janus, with his double face,
  and bunch of keys, the porter of the place.

pleasing accents he began:
  "tell me, ye trojans, for that name you own,
  nor is your course upon our coasts unknown-
  say what you seek, and whither were you bound:
  were you by stress of weather cast aground?
  (such dangers as on seas are often seen,
  and oft befall to miserable men,)
  or come, your shipping in our ports to lay,
  spent and disabled in so long a way?
  say what you want: the latians you shall find
  not forc'd to goodness, but by will inclin'd;
  for, since the time of saturn's holy reign,
  his hospitable customs we retain.
  i call to mind (but time the tale has worn)
  th' arunci told, that dardanus, tho' born
  on latian plains, yet sought the phrygian shore,
  and samothracia, samos call'd before.
  from tuscan coritum he claim'd his birth;
  but after, when exempt from mortal earth,
  from thence ascended to his kindred skies,
  a god, and, as a god, augments their sacrifice,"

  he said. ilioneus made this reply:

  of arm'd invasion, and embrace the war."
  then juno thus: "the grateful work is done,
  the seeds of discord sow'd, the war begun;
  frauds, fears, and fury have possess'd the state,
  and fix'd the causes of a lasting hate.
  a bloody hymen shall th' alliance join
  betwixt the trojan and ausonian line:
  but thou with speed to night and hell repair;
  for not the gods, nor angry jove, will bear
  thy lawless wand'ring walks in upper air.
  leave what remains to me." saturnia said:
  the sullen fiend her sounding wings display'd,
  unwilling left the light, and sought the nether shade.

  in midst of italy, well known to fame,
  there lies a lake (amsanctus is the name)
  below the lofty mounts: on either side
  thick forests the forbidden entrance hide.
  full in the center of the sacred wood
  an arm arises of the stygian flood,
  which, breaking from beneath with bellowing sound,
  whirls the black waves and rattling stones around.

  saturnian juno now, with double care,
  attends the fatal process of the war.
  the clowns, return'd, from battle bear the slain,
  implore the gods, and to their king complain.
  the corps of almon and the rest are shown;
  shrieks, clamors, murmurs, fill the frighted town.
  ambitious turnus in the press appears,
  and, aggravating crimes, augments their fears;
  proclaims his private injuries aloud,
  a solemn promise made, and disavow'd;
  a foreign son is sought, and a mix'd mungril brood.

  with rapid course descending to the fight;
  they rush along; the rattling woods give way;
  the branches bend before their sweepy sway.

  nor was praeneste's founder wanting there,
  whom fame reports the son of mulciber:
  found in the fire, and foster'd in the plains,
  a shepherd and a king at once he reigns,
  and leads to turnus' aid his country swains.
  his own praeneste sends a chosen band,
  with those who plow saturnia's gabine land;
  besides the succor which cold anien yields,
  the rocks of hernicus, and dewy fields,
  anagnia fat, and father amasene-
  a num'rous rout, but all of naked men:
  nor arms they wear, nor swords and bucklers wield,
  nor drive the chariot thro' the dusty field,
  but whirl from leathern slings huge balls of lead,
  and spoils of yellow wolves adorn their head;
  the left foot naked, when they march to fight,
  but in a bull's raw hide they sheathe the right.

  then thus the founder of the roman tow'rs:
  "these woods were first the seat of sylvan pow'rs,
  of nymphs and fauns, and salvage men, who took
  their birth from trunks of trees and stubborn oak.
  nor laws they knew, nor manners, nor the care
  of lab'ring oxen, or the shining share,
  nor arts of gain, nor what they gain'd to spare.
  their exercise the chase; the running flood
  supplied their thirst, the trees supplied their food.
  then saturn came, who fled the pow'r of jove,
  robb'd of his realms, and banish'd from above.
  the men, dispers'd on hills, to towns he brought,
  and laws ordain'd, and civil customs taught,
  and latium call'd the land where safe he lay
  from his unduteous son, and his usurping sway.
  with his mild empire, peace and plenty came;
  and hence the golden times deriv'd their name.
  a more degenerate and discolor'd age
  succeeded this, with avarice and rage.

  and saturn's empire often chang'd the name.

  by fortune's pow'r, and fate's resistless doom.

  thus, walking on, he spoke, and shew'd the gate,

  a reverent fear (such superstition reigns

  some god, they knew- what god, they could not tell-

  th' arcadians thought him jove; and said they saw
  the mighty thund'rer with majestic awe,
  who took his shield, and dealt his bolts around,
  and scatter'd tempests on the teeming ground.
  then saw two heaps of ruins, (once they stood
  two stately towns, on either side the flood,)
  saturnia's and janicula's remains;
  and either place the founder's name retains.
  discoursing thus together, they resort
  where poor evander kept his country court.
  they view'd the ground of rome's litigious hall;
  (once oxen low'd, where now the lawyers bawl;)
  then, stooping, thro' the narrow gate they press'd,
  when thus the king bespoke his trojan guest:

  but boiling youth, and blind desire of blood,
  push'd on his fury, to pursue the crowd.
  hamstring'd behind, unhappy gyges died;
  then phalaris is added to his side.
  the pointed jav'lins from the dead he drew,
  and their friends' arms against their fellows threw.
  strong halys stands in vain; weak phlegys flies;

  but, whom they fear'd without, they found within.

  what profits it my son to scape the fire,
  arm'd with his gods, and loaded with his sire;
  to pass the perils of the seas and wind;
  evade the greeks, and leave the war behind;
  to reach th' italian shores; if, after all,
  our second pergamus is doom'd to fall?
  much better had he curb'd his high desires,
  and hover'd o'er his ill-extinguish'd fires.
  to simois' banks the fugitives restore,
  and give them back to war, and all the woes before."

  deep indignation swell'd saturnia's heart:
  "and must i own," she said, "my secret smart-
  what with more decence were in silence kept,
  and, but for this unjust reproach, had slept?
  did god or man your fav'rite son advise,
  with war unhop'd the latians to surprise?
  by fate, you boast, and by the gods' decree,
  he left his native land for italy!
  confess the truth; by mad cassandra, more
  than heav'n inspir'd, he sought a foreign shore!
  did i persuade to trust his second troy
  to the raw conduct of a beardless b

  the fated land you sought so long by sea."
  he said, and, brandishing at once his blade,
  with eager pace pursued the flying shade.
  by chance a ship was fasten'd to the shore,
  which from old clusium king osinius bore:
  the plank was ready laid for safe ascent;
  for shelter there the trembling shadow bent,
  and skipp't and skulk'd, and under hatches went.
  exulting turnus, with regardless haste,
  ascends the plank, and to the galley pass'd.
  scarce had he reach'd the prow: saturnia's hand
  the haulsers cuts, and shoots the ship from land.
  with wind in poop, the vessel plows the sea,
  and measures back with speed her former way.
  meantime aeneas seeks his absent foe,
  and sends his slaughter'd troops to shades below.

  the guileful phantom now forsook the shroud,
  and flew sublime, and vanish'd in a cloud.
  too late young turnus the delusion found,
  far on the sea, still making from the ground.
  then, thankless for a life redeem'd by shame,

  i sav'd thy brother, and the sinking state:
  but now he struggles with unequal fate,
  and goes, with gods averse, o'ermatch'd in might,
  to meet inevitable death in fight;
  nor must i break the truce, nor can sustain the sight.
  thou, if thou dar'st thy present aid supply;
  it well becomes a sister's care to try."

  at this the lovely nymph, with grief oppress'd,
  thrice tore her hair, and beat her comely breast.
  to whom saturnia thus: "thy tears are late:
  haste, snatch him, if he can be snatch'd from fate:
  new tumults kindle; violate the truce:
  who knows what changeful fortune may produce?
  't is not a crime t' attempt what i decree;
  or, if it were, discharge the crime on me."
  she said, and, sailing on the winged wind,
  left the sad nymph suspended in her mind.

  and now pomp the peaceful kings appear:
  four steeds the chariot of latinus bear;
  twelve golden beams around his temples play,
  to mark his

  call them not trojans: perish the renown
  and name of troy, with that detested town.
  latium be latium still; let alba reign
  and rome's immortal majesty remain."

  then thus the founder of mankind replies
  (unruffled was his front, serene his eyes)
  "can saturn's issue, and heav'n's other heir,
  such endless anger in her bosom bear?
  be mistress, and your full desires obtain;
  but quench the choler you foment in vain.
