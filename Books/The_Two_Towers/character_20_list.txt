Theoden - 
                    	The
King of Rohan and keeper of the Golden Hall. Theoden is a good man,
but his wily and two-faced counselor, Wormtongue, has misled him,
urging him to support the evil Saruman. Gandalf reveals the truth
of Wormtongue's deception to Theoden, who then supports the members
of the Fellowship.
