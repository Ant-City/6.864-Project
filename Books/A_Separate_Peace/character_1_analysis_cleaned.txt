[CHARACTER]
although we see all of the characters through gene's eyes,
his perception of others is most significant in the case of [CHARACTER].
even as gene resents his best friend and harbors dark, unspoken
feelings of hatred toward him, he regards [CHARACTER] at times with something
akin to worship. his depiction of [CHARACTER] contains a strong note of
physical, if not erotic attraction. [CHARACTER] is presented in classical
terms, as a kind of greek hero-athlete, always excelling in physical
activities and always spirited--thymos, to use the
greek term. (these greek heroes were, like [CHARACTER], fated to die young;
the archetype was achilles, who considered it preferable to live
briefly and gloriously than to die of old age.) energetic and vibrant,
[CHARACTER] is a tremendous athlete; friendly and verbally adroit, he
is able to talk his way out of any situation. [CHARACTER] finds himself
in his element during devon's summer session; the substitute headmaster
enforces few rules and [CHARACTER] can let loose his spontaneity and boisterousness
without restraint. yet while he constantly tests the limits and
asserts his own will, he seeks neither to emerge "victorious" in
any argument or contest nor to "defeat" competing systems of rule.
blitzball, the game that he invents in which everyone competes furiously
but no one wins, perfectly embodies [CHARACTER]'s attitude toward life.
[CHARACTER]'s perspective on competition speaks to a more profound wisdom
and goodness regarding other human beings. just as he dislikes games
with winners and losers, so in life he always thinks the best of
people, counts no one as his enemy, and assumes that the world is
a fundamentally friendly place. these qualities, according to gene,
make [CHARACTER] unique; gene believes that humans are fearful and create
enemies where none exist. but [CHARACTER]'s inability to see others as
hostile is his weakness as well as his strength; he refuses to attribute
dark motives to gene and he continues to subject himself to what
may be a perilously--or even fatally--codependent relationship, never
imagining that gene's feelings for him are not as pure as his for
gene.
moreover, by assuming that everyone thinks like he does,
[CHARACTER] often acts selfishly, insisting that he and gene do whatever
he fancies. this carefree, self-absorbed attitude is one of the
roots of gene's resentment toward [CHARACTER], though [CHARACTER], aware only
of himself and seeing only the good in others, never seems to pick
up on gene's inner turmoil. [CHARACTER] is a powerful, charismatic figure--perhaps
too good a person, as he inspires in gene not only loyalty but also
jealousy.
