dr.[CHARACTER] - 
 a respected doctor and friend of both lanyon, a fellow
physician, and utterson, a lawyer. jekyll is a seemingly prosperous
man, well established in the community, and known for his decency
and charitable works. since his youth, however, he has secretly engaged
in unspecified dissolute and corrupt behavior. jekyll finds this
dark side a burden and undertakes experiments intended to separate
his good and evil selves from one another. through these experiments, he
brings mr. hyde into being, finding a way to transform himself in
such a way that he fully becomes his darker half.
