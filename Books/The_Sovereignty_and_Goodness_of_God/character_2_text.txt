narrative of the captivity and restoration of mrs. mary rowlandson



the first remove

now away we must go with those barbarous creatures, with our bodies
wounded and bleeding, and our hearts no less than our bodies. about a
mile we went that night, up upon a hill within sight of the town, where
they intended to lodge. there was hard by a vacant house (deserted by
the english before, for fear of the indians). i asked them whether i
might not lodge in the house that night, to which they answered, "what,
will you love english men still?" this was the dolefulest

d with such spectacles) whither i went
with a very heavy heart, and down i sat with the picture of death in my
lap. about two hours in the night, my sweet babe like a lamb departed
this life on feb. 18, 1675. it being about six years, and five months
old. it was nine days from the first wounding, in this miserable
condition, without any refreshing of one nature or other, except a
little cold water. i cannot but take notice how at another time i could
not bear to be in the room where any dead person was, but now the case
is changed; i must and could lie down by my dead babe, side by side all
the night after. i have thought since of the wonderful goodness of
god to me in preserving me in the use of my reason and senses in that
distressed time, that i did not use wicked and violent means to end my
own miserable life. in the morning, when they understood that my child
was dead they sent for me home to my master's wigwam (by my master in
this writing, must be understood quinnapin, who was a sa

married king philip's wife's sister; not that he first took me, but i
was sold to him by another narragansett indian, who took me when first i
came out of the garrison). i went to take up my dead child in my arms to
carry it with me, but they bid me let it alone; there was no resisting,
but go i must and leave it. when i had been at my master's wigwam, i
took the first opportunity i could get to go look after my dead child.
when i came i asked them what they had done with it; then they told me
it was upon the hill. then they went and showed me where it was, where i
saw the ground was newly digged, and there they told me they had buried
it. there i left that c

other. and as i was
going along, my heart was even overwhelmed with the thoughts of my
condition, and that i should have children, and a nation which i knew
not, ruled over them. whereupon i earnestly entreated the lord, that he
would consider my low estate, and show me a token for good, and if it
were his blessed will, some sign and hope of some relief. and indeed
quickly the lord answered, in some measure, my poor prayers; for as i
was going up and down mourning and lamenting my condition, my son came
to me, and asked me how i did. i had not seen him before, since the
destruction of the town, and i knew not where he was, till i was
informed by himself, that he was amongst a smaller parcel of indians,
whose place was about six miles off. with tears in his eyes, he asked
me whether his sister sarah was dead; and told me he had seen his
sister mary; and prayed me, that i would not be troubled in reference
to himself. the occasion of his coming to see me at this time, was this:
there was, a

s i said, about six miles from us, a small plantation of
indians, where it seems he had been during his captivity; and at this
time, there were some forces of the ind. gathered out of our company,
and some also from them (among whom was my son's master) to go to
assault and burn medfield. in this time of the absence of his master,
his dame brought him to see me. i took this to be some gracious answer
to my earnest and unfeigned desire. the next day, viz. to this, the
indians returned from medfield, all the company, for those that belonged
to the other small company, came through the town that now we were at.
but before they came to us, oh! the outrageous roaring and hooping that
there was. they began their din about a mile before the

s upon the canoe to step in
there was a sudden outcry among them, and i must step back, and instead
of going over the river, i must go four or five miles up the river
farther northward. some of the indians ran one way, and some another.
the cause of this rout was, as i thought, their espying some english
scouts, who were thereabout. in this travel up the river about noon the
company made a stop, and sat down; some to eat, and others to rest them.
as i sat amongst them, musing of things past, my son joseph unexpectedly
came to me. we asked of each other's welfare, bemoaning our doleful
condition, and the change that had come upon us. we had husband and
father, and children, and sisters, and friends, and relations, and
house, and home, and many comforts of this life: but now we may say, as
job, "naked came i out of my mother's womb, and naked shall i return:
the lord gave, the lord hath taken away, blessed be the name of the
lord." i asked him whether he would read. he told me he earnestly

ar's grease, but i thought i never tasted pleasanter meat in my
life. there was a squaw who spake to me to make a shirt for her sannup,
for which she gave me a piece of bear. another asked me to knit a pair
of stockings, for which she gave me a quart of peas. i boiled my peas
and bear together, and invited my master and mistress to dinner; but the
proud gossip, because i served them both in one dish, would eat nothing,
except one bit that he gave her upon the point of his knife. hearing
that my son was come to this place, i went to see him, and found him
lying flat upon the ground. i asked him how he could sleep so? he
answered me that he was not asleep, but at prayer; and lay so, that they
might not observe what he was doing. i pray god he may remember these
things now he is returned in safety. at this place (the sun now getting
higher) what with the beams and heat of the sun, and the smoke of the
wigwams, i thought i should have been blind. i could scarce discern one
wigwam from another

 had done it. i carried the knife in, and my master asked me to give
it him, and i was not a little glad that i had anything that they would
accept of, and be pleased with. when we were at this place, my master's
maid came home; she had been gone three weeks into the narragansett
country to fetch corn, where they had stored up some in the ground. she
brought home about a peck and half of corn. this was about the time that
their great captain, naananto, was killed in the narragansett country.
my son being now about a mile from me, i asked liberty to go and
see him; they bade me go, and away i went; but quickly lost myself,
traveling over hills and through swamps, and could not find the way to
him. and i cannot but admire at the wonderful power and goodness of god
to me, in that, though i was gone from home, and met with all sorts of
indians, and those i had no knowledge of, and there being no christian
soul near me; yet not one of them offered the least imaginable
miscarriage to me. i turn

ed homeward again, and met with my master. he
showed me the way to my son. when i came to him i found him not well:
and withall he had a boil on his side, which much troubled him. we
bemoaned one another a while, as the lord helped us, and then i returned
again. when i was returned, i found myself as unsatisfied as i was
before. i went up and down mourning and lamenting; and my spirit was
ready to sink with the thoughts of my poor children. my son was ill, and
i could not but think of his mournful looks, and no christian friend was
near him, to do any office of love for him, either for soul or body.
and my poor girl, i knew not where she was, nor whether she was sick, or
well, or alive, or dead. i repaired under these thoughts to my bible (my
great comfort in that time) and that scripture came to my hand, "cast
thy burden upon the lord, and he shall sustain thee" (psalm 55.22).

but i was fain to go and look after something to satisfy my

he tenth remove

that day a small part of the company removed about three-quarters of a
mile, intending further the next day. when they came to the place where
they intended to lodge, and had pitched their wigwams, being hungry, i
went again back to the place we were before at, to get something to eat,
being encouraged by the squaw's kindness, who bade me come again. when i
was there, there came an indian to look after me, who when he had found
me, kicked me all along. i went home and found venison roasting that
night, but they would not give me one bit of it. sometimes i met with
favor, and sometimes with nothing but frowns.




the eleventh remove

the next day in the morning they took their travel, intending a day's
journey up the river. i took my load at my back, and quickly we came to
wade over the river; and passed over tiresome and wearisome hills. one
hill was so steep that i was fain to creep up upon my knees, and to hold
by the twigs and bushes to keep myself from falling backwa

if my
head were off too.




the thirteenth remove

instead of going toward the bay, which was that i desired, i must go
with them five or six miles down the river into a mighty thicket of
brush; where we abode almost a fortnight. here one asked me to make a
shirt for her papoose, for which she gave me a mess of broth, which
was thickened with meal made of the bark of a tree, and to make it the
better, she had put into it about a handful of peas, and a few roasted
ground nuts. i had not seen my son a pretty while, and here was an
indian of whom i made inquiry after him, and asked him when he saw him.
he answered me that such a time his master roasted him, and that himself
did eat a piece of him, as big as his two fingers, and that he was very
good meat. but the lord upheld my spirit, under this discouragement; and
i considered their horrible addictedness to lying, and that there is
not one of them that makes the least conscience of speaking of truth.
in this place, on a cold night, as i l

h to say with job, "have pity upon
me, o ye my friends, for the hand of the lord has touched me." and
here i cannot but remember how many times sitting in their wigwams, and
musing on things past, i should suddenly leap up and run out, as if i
had been at home, forgetting where i was, and what my condition was;
but when i was without, and saw nothing but wilderness, and woods, and
a company of barbarous heathens, my mind quickly returned to me, which
made me think of that, spoken concerning sampson, who said, "i will go
out and shake myself as at other times, but he wist not that the lord
was departed from him." about this time i began to think that all my
hopes of restoration would come to nothing. i thought of the english
army, and hoped for their coming, and being taken by them, but that
failed. i hoped to be carried to albany, as the indians had discoursed
before, but that failed also. i thought of being sold to my husband, as
my master spake, but instead of that, my master himself wa

 her i would not. then my mistress bade me give it,
but still i said no. the maid told me if i would not give her a piece,
she would tear a piece off it. i told her i would tear her coat then.
with that my mistress rises up, and take up a stick big enough to have
killed me, and struck at me with it. but i stepped out, and she struck
the stick into the mat of the wigwam. but while she was pulling of it
out i ran to the maid and gave her all my apron, and so that storm went
over.

hearing that my son was come to this place, i went to see him, and
told him his father was well, but melancholy. he told me he was as much
grieved for his father as for himself. i wondered at his speech, for i
thought i had enough upon my spirit in reference to myself, to make me
mindless of my husband and everyone else; they being safe among their
friends. he told me also, that awhile before, his master (together with
other indians) were going to the french for powder; but by the way the
mohawks met with them, an

his eyes and nose and mouth full of dirt,
and yet alive, and groaning. i advised john to go and get to some fire.
he told me he could not stand, but i persuaded him still, lest he should
lie there and die. and with much ado i got him to a fire, and went
myself home. as soon as i was got home his master's daughter came after
me, to know what i had done with the englishman. i told her i had got
him to a fire in such a place. now had i need to pray paul's prayer
"that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men" (2
thessalonians 3.2). for her satisfaction i went along with her, and
brought her to him; but before i got home again it was noised about that
i was running away and getting the english youth, along with me; that as
soon as i came in they began to rant and domineer, asking me where i had
been, and what i had been doing? and saying they would knock him on the
head. i told them i had been seeing the english youth, and that i would
not run away. they told me i lied, and taking

him, and he gave me some roasted ground nuts, which did
again revive my feeble stomach.

being got out of her sight, i had time and liberty again to look into
my bible; which was my guide by day, and my pillow by night. now that
comfortable scripture presented itself to me, "for a small moment have i
forsaken thee, but with great mercies will i gather thee" (isaiah 54.7).
thus the lord carried me along from one time to another, and made good
to me this precious promise, and many others. then my son came to see
me, and i asked his master to let him stay awhile with me, that i might
comb his head, and look over him, for he was almost overcome with lice.
he told me, when i had done, that he was very hungry, but i had nothing
to relieve him, but bid him go into the wigwams as he went along, and
see if he could get any thing among them. which he did, and it seems
tarried a little too long; for his master was angry with him, and beat
him, and then sold him. then he came running to tell me he ha

ven him some ground nuts already. then i went
along with him to his new master who told me he loved him, and he should
not want. so his master carried him away, and i never saw him afterward,
till i saw him at piscataqua in portsmouth.

that night they bade me go out of the wigwam again. my mistress's
papoose was sick, and it died that night, and there was one benefit in
it--that there was more room. i went to a wigwam, and they bade me come
in, and gave me a skin to lie upon, and a mess of venison and ground
nuts, which was a choice dish among them. on the morrow they buried the
papoose, and afterward, both morning and evening, there came a company
to mourn and howl with her; though i confess i could not much condole
with them. many sorrowful days i had in this place, often getting alone.
"like a crane, or a swallow, so did i chatter; i did mourn as a dove,
mine eyes ail with looking upward. oh, lord, i am oppressed; undertake
for me" (isaiah 38.14). i could tell the lord, as hezekiah, "

 fifteenth remove

we went on our travel. i having got one handful of ground nuts, for my
support that day, they gave me my load, and i went on cheerfully (with
the thoughts of going homeward), having my burden more on my back than
my spirit. we came to banquang river again that day, near which we abode
a few days. sometimes one of them would give me a pipe, another a
little tobacco, another a little salt: which i would change for a little
victuals. i cannot but think what a wolvish appetite persons have in a
starving condition; for many times when they gave me that which was hot,
i was so greedy, that i should burn my mouth, that it would trouble me
hours after, and yet i should quickly do the same again. and after i was
thoroughly hungry, i was never again satisfied. for though sometimes it
fell out, that i got enough, and did eat till i could eat no more, yet
i was as unsatisfied as i was when i began. and now could i see that
scripture verified (there being many scriptures which we do
 
 ___________________________
 
 not take
notice of, or understand till we are afflicted) "thou shalt eat and not
be satisfied" (micah 6.14). now might i see more than ever before, the
miseries that sin hath brought upon us. many times i should be ready to
run against the heathen, but the scripture would quiet me again, "shall
there be evil in a city and the lord hath not done it?" (amos 3.6). the
lord help me to make a right improvement of his word, and that i might
learn that great lesson: "he hath showed thee (oh man) what is good, and
what doth the lord require of thee, but to do justly, and love mercy,
and walk humbly with thy god? hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed
it" (micah 6.8-9).




the sixteenth removal

we began this remove with wading over banquang river: the water was up
to the knees, and the stream very swift, and so cold that i thought it
would have cut me in sunder. i was so weak and feeble, that i reeled
as i went along, and thought there i must end my days

and
acorns, artichokes, lilly roots, ground beans, and several other weeds
and roots, that i know not.

they would pick up old bones, and cut them to pieces at the joints, and
if they were full of worms and maggots, they would scald them over the
fire to make the vermine come out, and then boil them, and drink up the
liquor, and then beat the great ends of them in a mortar, and so eat
them. they would eat horse's guts, and ears, and all sorts of wild birds
which they could catch; also bear, venison, beaver, tortoise, frogs,
squirrels, dogs, skunks, rattlesnakes; yea, the very bark of trees;
besides all sorts of creatures, and provision which they plundered from
the english. i can but stand in admiration to see the wonderful power
of god in providing for such a vast number of our enemies in the
wilderness, where there was nothing to be seen, but from hand to mouth.
many times in a morning, the generality of them would eat up all they
had, and yet have some further supply against they wante

or that.
we kept inquiring and listening to hear concerning them, but no certain
news as yet. about this time the council had ordered a day of public
thanksgiving. though i thought i had still cause of mourning, and being
unsettled in our minds, we thought we would ride toward the eastward,
to see if we could hear anything concerning our children. and as we were
riding along (god is the wise disposer of all things) between ipswich
and rowley we met with mr. william hubbard, who told us that our son
joseph was come in to major waldron's, and another with him, which was
my sister's son. i asked him how he knew it? he said the major himself
told him so. so along we went till we came to newbury; and their
minister being absent, they desired my husband to preach the
thanksgiving for them; but he was not willing to stay there that night,
but would go over to salisbury, to hear further, and come again in the
morning, which he did, and preached there that day. at night, when
he had done, one came

sink into the earth (my children
being gone, i could not tell whither) and my knees trembling under me,
and i was walking through the valley of the shadow of death; then the
lord brought, and now has fulfilled that reviving word unto me: "thus
saith the lord, refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from
tears, for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the lord, and they shall
come again from the land of the enemy." now we were between them, the
one on the east, and the other on the west. our son being nearest, we
went to him first, to portsmouth, where we met with him, and with the
major also, who told us he had done what he could, but could not redeem
him under seven pounds, which the good people thereabouts were pleased
to pay. the lord reward the major, and all the rest, though unknown
to me, for their labor of love. my sister's son was redeemed for four
pounds, which the council gave order for the payment of. having now
received one of our children, we hastened toward the other. go

to us near hand, and afar off.

i can remember the time when i used to sleep quietly without workings
in my thoughts, whole nights together, but now it is other ways with me.
when all are fast about me, and no eye open, but his who ever waketh, my
thoughts are upon things past, upon the awful dispensation of the
lord towards us, upon his wonderful power and might, in carrying of us
through so many difficulties, in returning us in safety, and suffering
none to hurt us. i remember in the night season, how the other day i was
in the midst of thousands of enemies, and nothing but death before me.
it is then hard work to persuade myself, that ever i should be satisfied
with bread again. but now we are fed with the finest of the wheat, and,
as i may say, with honey out of the rock. instead of the husk, we have
the fatted calf. the thoughts of these things in the particulars of
them, and of the love and goodness of god towards us, make it true
of me, what david said of himself, "i watered my cou

 wish for
it. when i lived in prosperity, having the comforts of the world about
me, my relations by me, my heart cheerful, and taking little care for
anything, and yet seeing many, whom i preferred before myself, under
many trials and afflictions, in sickness, weakness, poverty, losses,
crosses, and cares of the world, i should be sometimes jealous least i
should have my portion in this life, and that scripture would come to my
mind, "for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son
whom he receiveth" (hebrews 12.6). but now i see the lord had his
time to scourge and chasten me. the portion of some is to have their
afflictions by drops, now one drop and then another; but the dregs of
the cup, the wine of astonishment, like a sweeping rain that leaveth no
food, did the lord prepare to be my portion. affliction i wanted, and
affliction i had, full measure (i thought), pressed down and running
over. yet i see, when god calls a person to anything, and through never
so many dif
