ded frosts
fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,
and on old hyems chinne and icie crowne,
an odorous chaplet of sweet sommer buds
is as in mockry set. the spring, the sommer,
the childing autumne, angry winter change
their wonted liueries, and the mazed world,
by their increase, now knowes not which is which;
and this same progeny of euills,
comes from our debate, from our dissention,
we are their parents and originall

   ober. do you amend it then, it lies in you,
why should titania crosse her oberon?
i do but beg a little changeling boy,
to be my henchman

   qu. set your heart at rest,
the fairy land buyes not the childe of me,
his mother was a votresse of my order,
and in the spiced indian aire, by night
full often hath she gossipt by my side,
and sat with me on neptunes yellow sands,
marking th' embarked traders on the flood,

 vpon a little westerne flower;
before, milke-white: now purple with loues wound,
and maidens call it, loue in idlenesse.
fetch me that flower; the hearb i shew'd thee once,
the iuyce of it, on sleeping eye-lids laid,
will make or man or woman madly dote
vpon the next liue creature that it sees.
fetch me this hearbe, and be thou heere againe,
ere the leuiathan can swim a league

   pucke. ile put a girdle about the earth, in forty minutes

   ober. hauing once this iuyce,
ile watch titania, when she is asleepe,
and drop the liquor of it in her eyes:
the next thing when she waking lookes vpon,
(be it on lyon, beare, or wolfe, or bull,
on medling monkey, or on busie ape)
shee shall pursue it, with the soule of loue.
and ere i take this charme off from her sight,
(as i can take it with another hearbe)
ile make her render vp her page to me.
but who comes heere? i am inuisible,
and i will ouer-heare their conference.
enter demetrius, helena following him.

  deme. i loue

you, your kindred hath made my eyes water ere

mustard-seede

   tita. come waite vpon him, lead him to my bower.
the moone me-thinks, lookes with a watrie eie,
and when she weepes, weepe euerie little flower,
lamenting some enforced chastitie.
tye vp my louers tongue, bring him silently.
enter.

enter king of pharies, solus.

  ob. i wonder if titania be awak't;
then what it was that next came in her eye,
which she must dote on, in extremitie.
enter pucke.

here comes my messenger: how now mad spirit,
what night-rule now about this haunted groue?
  puck. my mistris with a monster is in loue,
neere to her close and consecrated bower,
while she was in her dull and sleeping hower,
a crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
that worke for bread vpon athenian stals,
were met together to rehearse a play,
intended for great theseus nuptiall

e boy, i will vndoe
this hatefull imperfection of her eyes.
and gentle pucke, take this transformed scalpe,
from off the head of this athenian swaine;
that he awaking when the other doe,
may all to athens backe againe repaire,
and thinke no more of this nights accidents,
but as the fierce vexation of dreame.
but first i will release the fairy queene.
be thou as thou wast wont to be;
see as thou wast wont to see.
dians bud, or cupids flower,
hath such force and blessed power.
now my titania wake you my sweet queene

   tita. my oberon, what visions haue i seene!
me-thought i was enamoured of an asse

   ob. there lies your loue

   tita. how came these things to passe?
oh, how mine eyes doth loath this visage now!
  ob. silence a while. robin take off his head:
titania, musick call, and strike more dead
then common sleepe; of all these, fine the sense

   tita. musicke, ho musicke, such as charmeth sleepe.

musick still.
