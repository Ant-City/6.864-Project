reath. bricks are crumbling in places, and the front door 
is so swollen you have to push hard to get in. there is  no 
front yard, only four little elms the city planted by the curb. 
out  back  is  a  small  garage  for  the  car we  don't  own  yet 
and a small yard that looks smaller between the two build­
ings  on  either  side.  there  are  stairs  in  our  house,  but 
they're ordinary hallway stairs, and the house has only one 
washroom. everybody has to share a bedroom-mama and 
papa, carlos and kiki,  me and nenny. 

once when we were living on loomis, a nun from my 
school passed by and saw  me playing out front.  the laun­
dromat  downstairs  had  been  boarded  up because  it  had

someday  i will  have a best friend all  my  own.  one i 
can tell  my  secrets  to.  one who will  understand my jokes 
without my  having to explain them. until then i am a red 
balloon, a balloon tied to an anchor. 

boys  &  girls 

the  boys  and  the  girls  live  in  separate worlds.  the 
boys  in  their  universe  and  we  in  ours.  my  brothers  for 
example. they've got plenty to say to me and nenny inside 
the house.  but outside  they can't be  seen  talking to girls. 
carlos and kiki are each other's best friend ... not ours. 
nenny  is  too  young  to  be  my  friend.  she's just  my 
sister and that was not my fault. you don't pick your sisters, 
you just get them and sometimes they come like  nenny. 

she can't  play  with  those  vargas  kids  or she'll  turn 
out just like them. and since she comes right after me, she 
is my  responsibility.
