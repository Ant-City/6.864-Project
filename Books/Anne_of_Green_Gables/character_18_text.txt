ne start off to school on the first day of september
with many secret misgivings. anne was such an odd girl. how would she
get on with the other children? and how on earth would she ever manage
to hold her tongue during school hours?

things went better than marilla feared, however. anne came home that
evening in high spirits.

“i think i’m going to like school here,” she announced. “i don’t think
much of the master, through. he’s all the time curling his mustache
and making eyes at prissy andrews. prissy is grown up, you know. she’s
sixteen and she’s studying for the entrance examination into queen’s
academy at charlottetown next year. tillie boulter says the master is
_dead gone_ on her. she’s got a beautiful complexion and curly brown hair
and she does it up so elegantly. she sits in the long seat at the back
and he sits there, too, most of the time--to explain her lessons, he
says. but ruby gillis says she saw him writing something on her slate
and when prissy read it she blu

 it, all marked over. i felt so mortified, marilla; he might have
been politer to a stranger, i think. ruby gillis gave me an apple and
sophia sloane lent me a lovely pink card with ‘may i see you home?’ on
it. i’m to give it back to her tomorrow. and tillie boulter let me wear
her bead ring all the afternoon. can i have some of those pearl beads
off the old pincushion in the garret to make myself a ring? and oh,
marilla, jane andrews told me that minnie macpherson told her that she
heard prissy andrews tell sara gillis that i had a very pretty nose.
marilla, that is the first compliment i have ever had in my life and you
can’t imagine what a strange feeling it gave me. marilla, have i really
a pretty nose? i know you’ll tell me the truth.”

“your nose is well enough,” said marilla shortly. secretly she thought
anne’s nose was a remarkable pretty one; but she had no intention of
telling her so.

that was three weeks ago and all had gone smoothly so far. and now, this

in her book. mr. phillips didn’t see her--he was looking at prissy
andrews--but i did. i just swept her a look of freezing scorn and she
got as red as a beet and spelled it wrong after all.”

“those pye girls are cheats all round,” said diana indignantly, as they
climbed the fence of the main road. “gertie pye actually went and put
her milk bottle in my place in the brook yesterday. did you ever? i
don’t speak to her now.”

when mr. phillips was in the back of the room hearing prissy andrews’s
latin, diana whispered to anne, “that’s gilbert blythe sitting right
across the aisle from you, anne. just look at him and see if you don’t
think he’s handsome.”

anne looked accordingly. she had a good chance to do so, for the said
gilbert blythe was absorbed in stealthily pinning the long yellow braid
of ruby gillis, who sat in front of him, to the back of her seat. he
was a tall boy, with curly brown hair, roguish hazel eyes, and a mouth
twisted into a teasing smile. presently

had whisked the pin out of sight and was studying his history with the
soberest face in the world; but when the commotion subsided he looked at
anne and winked with inexpressible drollery.

“i think your gilbert blythe _is_ handsome,” confided anne to diana,
“but i think he’s very bold. it isn’t good manners to wink at a strange
girl.”

but it was not until the afternoon that things really began to happen.

mr. phillips was back in the corner explaining a problem in algebra to
prissy andrews and the rest of the scholars were doing pretty much as
they pleased eating green apples, whispering, drawing pictures on their
slates, and driving crickets harnessed to strings, up and down aisle.
gilbert blythe was trying to make anne shirley look at him and failing
utterly, because anne was at that moment totally oblivious not only
to the very existence of gilbert blythe, but of every other scholar in
avonlea school itself. with her chin propped on her hands and her eyes
fixed on the blue gli

s canada is going to the dogs the way things are being run at ottawa
and that it’s an awful warning to the electors. she says if women were
allowed to vote we would soon see a blessed change. what way do you
vote, matthew?”

“conservative,” said matthew promptly. to vote conservative was part of
matthew’s religion.

“then i’m conservative too,” said anne decidedly. “i’m glad because
gil--because some of the boys in school are grits. i guess mr. phillips
is a grit too because prissy andrews’s father is one, and ruby gillis
says that when a man is courting he always has to agree with the girl’s
mother in religion and her father in politics. is that true, matthew?”

“well now, i dunno,” said matthew.

“did you ever go courting, matthew?”

“well now, no, i dunno’s i ever did,” said matthew, who had certainly
never thought of such a thing in his whole existence.

anne reflected with her chin in her hands.

“it must be rather interesting, don’t you think, matthe

w? ruby gillis
says when she grows up she’s going to have ever so many beaus on the
string and have them all crazy about her; but i think that would be too
exciting. i’d rather have just one in his right mind. but ruby gillis
knows a great deal about such matters because she has so many big
sisters, and mrs. lynde says the gillis girls have gone off like hot
cakes. mr. phillips goes up to see prissy andrews nearly every evening.
he says it is to help her with her lessons but miranda sloane is
studying for queen’s too, and i should think she needed help a lot more
than prissy because she’s ever so much stupider, but he never goes to
help her in the evenings at all. there are a great many things in this
world that i can’t understand very well, matthew.”

“well now, i dunno as i comprehend them all myself,” acknowledged
matthew.

“well, i suppose i must finish up my lessons. i won’t a

such places at all.”

“i’m sure the debating club is a most respectable affair,” pleaded anne.

“i’m not saying it isn’t. but you’re not going to begin gadding about
to concerts and staying out all hours of the night. pretty doings for
children. i’m surprised at mrs. barry’s letting diana go.”

“but it’s such a very special occasion,” mourned anne, on the verge of
tears. “diana has only one birthday in a year. it isn’t as if birthdays
were common things, marilla. prissy andrews is going to recite ‘curfew
must not ring tonight.’ that is such a good moral piece, marilla, i’m
sure it would do me lots of good to hear it. and the choir are going to
sing four lovely pathetic songs that are pretty near as good as hymns.
and oh, marilla, the minister is going to take part; yes, indeed, he is;
he’s going to give an address. that will be just about the same thing as
a sermon. please, mayn’t i go, marilla?”

“you heard what i said, anne, didn’t you? take off your

 it all like a beautiful dream? do i really look the
same as usual? i feel so different that it seems to me it must show in
my looks.”

“you look awfully nice,” said diana, who having just received a
compliment from one of her cousins, felt that she ought to pass it on.
“you’ve got the loveliest color.”

the program that night was a series of “thrills” for at least one
listener in the audience, and, as anne assured diana, every succeeding
thrill was thrillier than the last. when prissy andrews, attired in
a new pink-silk waist with a string of pearls about her smooth white
throat and real carnations in her hair--rumor whispered that the master
had sent all the way to town for them for her--“climbed the slimy
ladder, dark without one ray of light,” anne shivered in luxurious
sympathy; when the choir sang “far above the gentle daisies” anne gazed
at the ceiling as if it were frescoed with angels; when sam sloane
proceeded to explain and illustrate “how sockery set a hen” an

to miss them. do you know what i think mayflowers are, marilla? i think
they must be the souls of the flowers that died last summer and this
is their heaven. but we had a splendid time today, marilla. we had our
lunch down in a big mossy hollow by an old well--such a _romantic_ spot.
charlie sloane dared arty gillis to jump over it, and arty did because
he wouldn’t take a dare. nobody would in school. it is very _fashionable_
to dare. mr. phillips gave all the mayflowers he found to prissy andrews
and i heard him to say ‘sweets to the sweet.’ he got that out of a
book, i know; but it shows he has some imagination. i was offered some
mayflowers too, but i rejected them with scorn. i can’t tell you the
person’s name because i have vowed never to let it cross my lips. we
made wreaths of the mayflowers and put them on our hats; and when the
time came to go home we marched in procession down the road, two by two,
with our bouquets and wreaths, singing ‘my home on the hill.’ oh, it

but still i wish it wasn’t thirteen.”

“i do wish i was going in with you,” said diana. “wouldn’t we have
a perfectly elegant time? but i suppose you’ll have to cram in the
evenings.”

“no; miss stacy has made us promise not to open a book at all. she says
it would only tire and confuse us and we are to go out walking and not
think about the exams at all and go to bed early. it’s good advice, but
i expect it will be hard to follow; good advice is apt to be, i think.
prissy andrews told me that she sat up half the night every night of her
entrance week and crammed for dear life; and i had determined to sit up
_at least_ as long as she did. it was so kind of your aunt josephine to
ask me to stay at beechwood while i’m in town.”

“you’ll write to me while you’re in, won’t you?”

“i’ll write tuesday night and tell you how the first day goes,” promised
anne.

“i’ll be haunting the post office wednesday,” vowed diana.

anne went to town the following
