hadst thou but lou'd him halfe so well as i,

or nourisht him, as i did with my blood;
thou would'st haue left thy dearest heart-blood there,
rather then haue made that sauage duke thine heire,
and dis-inherited thine onely sonne

if you be king, why should not i succeede?

i shame to heare thee speake: ah timorous wretch,
thou hast vndone thy selfe, thy sonne, and me,
and giu'n vnto the house of yorke such head,
as thou shalt reigne but by their sufferance.
to entayle him and his heires vnto the crowne,
what is it, but to make thy sepulcher,
and creepe into it farre before thy time?

her sighes will make a batt'ry in his brest,

and nero will be tainted with remorse,
to heare and see her plaints, her brinish teares.
