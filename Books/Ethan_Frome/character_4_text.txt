neighbours; and though all conceded that ethan frome’s had been beyond the common measure, no one gave me an explanation of the look in his face which, as i persisted in thinking, neither poverty nor physical suffering could have put there. nevertheless, i might have contented myself with the story pieced together from these hints had it not been for the provocation of mrs. hale’s silence, and—a little later—for the accident of personal contact with the man.
on my arrival at starkfield, denis eady, the rich irish grocer, who was the proprietor of starkfield’s nearest approach to a livery stable, had entered into an agreement to send me over daily to corbury flats, where i had to pick up my train for the junction. but about the middle of the winter eady’s horses fell ill of a local epidemic. the illness spread to the other starkfield stables and for a day or two i was put to it to find a means of transport. then harmon gow suggested that ethan frome’s bay was still on his legs and t

ehead, and the dark eyes which seemed the only fixed points in a maze of flying lines.
the dancers were going faster and faster, and the musicians, to keep up with them, belaboured their instruments like jockeys lashing their mounts on the home-stretch; yet it seemed to the young man at the window that the reel would never end. now and then he turned his eyes from the girl’s face to that of her partner, which, in the exhilaration of the dance, had taken on a look of almost impudent ownership. denis eady was the son of michael eady, the ambitious irish grocer, whose suppleness and effrontery had given starkfield its first notion of “smart” business methods, and whose new brick store testified to the success of the attempt. his son seemed likely to follow in his steps, and was meanwhile applying the same arts to the conquest of the starkfield maidenhood. hitherto ethan frome had been content to think him a mean fellow; but now he positively invited a horse-whipping. it was strange that the g

goes.”
frome turned away again, and taking up his razor stooped to catch the reflection of his stretched cheek in the blotched looking-glass above the wash-stand.
“why on earth should mattie go?”
“well, when she gets married, i mean,” his wife’s drawl came from behind him.
“oh, she’d never leave us as long as you needed her,” he returned, scraping hard at his chin.
“i wouldn’t ever have it said that i stood in the way of a poor girl like mattie marrying a smart fellow like denis eady,” zeena answered in a tone of plaintive self-effacement.
ethan, glaring at his face in the glass, threw his head back to draw the razor from ear to chin. his hand was steady, but the attitude was an excuse for not making an immediate reply.
“and the doctor don’t want i should be left without anybody,” zeena continued. “he wanted i should speak to you about a girl he’s heard about, that might come—”
ethan laid down the razor and straightened himself with a laugh.
“denis eady! i

haste. “all right. but i haven’t got the time now; i’m late as it is,” he returned, holding his old silver turnip-watch to the candle.
zeena, apparently accepting this as final, lay watching him in silence while he pulled his suspenders over his shoulders and jerked his arms into his coat; but as he went toward the door she said, suddenly and incisively: “i guess you’re always late, now you shave every morning.”
that thrust had frightened him more than any vague insinuations about denis eady. it was a fact that since mattie silver’s coming he had taken to shaving every day; but his wife always seemed to be asleep when he left her side in the winter darkness, and he had stupidly assumed that she would not notice any change in his appearance. once or twice in the past he had been faintly disquieted by zenobia’s way of letting things happen without seeming to remark them, and then, weeks afterward, in a casual phrase, revealing that she had all along taken her notes and drawn her

inferences. of late, however, there had been no room in his thoughts for such vague apprehensions. zeena herself, from an oppressive reality, had faded into an insubstantial shade. all his life was lived in the sight and sound of mattie silver, and he could no longer conceive of its being otherwise. but now, as he stood outside the church, and saw mattie spinning down the floor with denis eady, a throng of disregarded hints and menaces wove their cloud about his brain....

as the dancers poured out of the hall frome, drawing back behind the projecting storm-door, watched the segregation of the grotesquely muffled groups, in which a moving lantern ray now and then lit up a face flushed with food and dancing. the villagers, being afoot, were the first to climb the slope to the main street, while the country neighbours packed themselves more slowly into the sleighs under the shed

scarf irresolutely about her fingers. not for the world would he have made a sign to her, though it seemed to him that his life hung on her next gesture.
“hold on a minute while i unhitch the colt,” denis called to her, springing toward the shed.
she stood perfectly still, looking after him, in an attitude of tranquil expectancy torturing to the hidden watcher. frome noticed that she no longer turned her head from side to side, as though peering through the night for another figure. she let denis eady lead out the horse, climb into the cutter and fling back the bearskin to make room for her at his side; then, with a swift motion of flight, she turned about and darted up the slope toward the front of the church.
“good-bye! hope you’ll have a lovely ride!” she called back to him over her shoulder.
denis laughed, and gave the horse a cut that brought him quickly abreast of her retreating figure.
“come along! get in quick! it’s as slippery as thunder on this turn,” he cried, leaning

come back for me.”
“couldn’t? what on earth could stop me?”
“i knew zeena wasn’t feeling any too good to-day.”
“oh, she’s in bed long ago.” he paused, a question struggling in him. “then you meant to walk home all alone?”
“oh, i ain’t afraid!” she laughed.
they stood together in the gloom of the spruces, an empty world glimmering about them wide and grey under the stars. he brought his question out.
“if you thought i hadn’t come, why didn’t you ride back with denis eady?”
“why, where were you? how did you know? i never saw you!”
her wonder and his laughter ran together like spring rills in a thaw. ethan had the sense of having done something arch and ingenious. to prolong the effect he groped for a dazzling phrase, and brought out, in a growl of rapture: “come along.”
he slipped an arm through hers, as eady had done, and fancied it was faintly pressed against her side, but neither of them moved. it was so dark under the spruces that he could barely s

, would you, ethan? it would be lovely!”
“we’ll come to-morrow if there’s a moon.”
she lingered, pressing closer to his side. “ned hale and ruth varnum came just as near running into the big elm at the bottom. we were all sure they were killed.” her shiver ran down his arm. “wouldn’t it have been too awful? they’re so happy!”
“oh, ned ain’t much at steering. i guess i can take you down all right!” he said disdainfully.
he was aware that he was “talking big,” like denis eady; but his reaction of joy had unsteadied him, and the inflection with which she had said of the engaged couple “they’re so happy!” made the words sound as if she had been thinking of herself and him.
“the elm is dangerous, though. it ought to be cut down,” she insisted.
“would you be afraid of it, with me?”
“i told you i ain’t the kind to be afraid” she tossed back, almost indifferently; and suddenly she began to walk on with a rapid step.

 as the flit of a bird in the branches. the fact that he had no right to show his feelings, and thus provoke the expression of hers, made him attach a fantastic importance to every change in her look and tone. now he thought she understood him, and feared; now he was sure she did not, and despaired. to-night the pressure of accumulated misgivings sent the scale drooping toward despair, and her indifference was the more chilling after the flush of joy into which she had plunged him by dismissing denis eady. he mounted school house hill at her side and walked on in silence till they reached the lane leading to the saw-mill; then the need of some definite assurance grew too strong for him.
“you’d have found me right off if you hadn’t gone back to have that last reel with denis,” he brought out awkwardly. he could not pronounce the name without a stiffening of the muscles of his throat.
“why, ethan, how could i tell you were there?”
“i suppose what folks say is true,” he jerked out a

ngered in his ears, and he reflected grimly that his seven years with zeena seemed to starkfield “not so long.”
the afternoon was drawing to an end, and here and there a lighted pane spangled the cold gray dusk and made the snow look whiter. the bitter weather had driven every one indoors and ethan had the long rural street to himself. suddenly he heard the brisk play of sleigh-bells and a cutter passed him, drawn by a free-going horse. ethan recognised michael eady’s roan colt, and young denis eady, in a handsome new fur cap, leaned forward and waved a greeting. “hello, ethe!” he shouted and spun on.
the cutter was going in the direction of the frome farm, and ethan’s heart contracted as he listened to the dwindling bells. what more likely than that denis eady had heard of zeena’s departure for bettsbridge, and was profiting by the opportunity to spend an hour with mattie? ethan was ashamed of the storm of jealousy in his breast. it seemed unworthy of the girl that his thoughts of

sacred to the memory of ethan frome and endurance his wife, who dwelled together in peace for fifty years.
he used to think that fifty years sounded like a long time to live together; but now it seemed to him that they might pass in a flash. then, with a sudden dart of irony, he wondered if, when their turn came, the same epitaph would be written over him and zeena.
he opened the barn-door and craned his head into the obscurity, half-fearing to discover denis eady’s roan colt in the stall beside the sorrel. but the old horse was there alone, mumbling his crib with toothless jaws, and ethan whistled cheerfully while he bedded down the grays and shook an extra measure of oats into their mangers. his was not a tuneful throat—but harsh melodies burst from it as he locked the barn and sprang up the hill to the house. he reached the kitchen-porch and turned the door-handle; but the door did not yield to his touch.
startled at finding it locked he rattled t
