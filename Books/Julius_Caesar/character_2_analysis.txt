Antony
Antony proves strong in all of the ways that Brutus proves
weak. His impulsive, improvisatory nature serves him perfectly,
first to persuade the conspirators that he is on their side, thus
gaining their leniency, and then to persuade the plebeians of the
conspirators' injustice, thus gaining the masses' political support.
Not too scrupulous to stoop to deceit and duplicity, as Brutus claims
to be, Antony proves himself a consummate politician, using gestures
and skilled rhetoric to his advantage. He responds to subtle cues
among both his nemeses and his allies to know exactly how he must
conduct himself at each particular moment in order to gain the most
advantage. In both his eulogy for Caesar and the play as a whole,
Antony is adept at tailoring his words and actions to his audiences'
desires. Unlike Brutus, who prides himself on acting solely with
respect to virtue and blinding himself to his personal concerns,
Antony never separates his private affairs from his public actions.
