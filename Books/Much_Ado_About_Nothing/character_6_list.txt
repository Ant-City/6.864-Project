Don John - 
                The
illegitimate brother of Don Pedro; sometimes called "the Bastard."
Don John is melancholy and sullen by nature, and he creates a dark
scheme to ruin the happiness of Hero and Claudio. He is the villain
of the play; his evil actions are motivated by his envy of his brother's
social authority.
