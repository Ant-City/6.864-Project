act iv. scene i.
a house in rome. antony, octavius, and lepidus, seated at a
table.

  antony. these many then shall die, their names are prick'd.
  octavius. your brother too must die; consent you, lepidus?
  lepidus. i do consent-
  octavius. prick him down, antony.
  lepidus. upon condition publius shall not live,
    who is your sister's son, mark antony.
  antony. he shall not live; look, with a spot i damn him.
    but, lepidus, go you to caesar's house,
    fetch the will hither, and we shall determine

gacies.
  lepidus. what, shall i find you here?
  octavius. or here, or at the capitol.            exit lepidus.
  antony. this is a slight unmeritable man,
    meet to be sent on errands. is it fit,
    the three-fold world divided, he should stand
    one of the three to share it?
  octavius. so you thought him,
    and took his voice who should be prick'd to die
    in our black sentence and proscription.
  antony. octavius, i have seen more days than you,
    and though we lay these honors on this man
    to ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,
    he shall but bear them as the ass b

having brought our treasure where we will,
    then take we down his load and turn him off,
    like to the empty ass, to shake his ears
    and graze in commons.
  octavius. you may do your will,
    but he's a tried and valiant soldier.
  antony. so is my horse, octavius, and for that
    i do appoint him store of provender.
    it is a creature that i teach to fight,
    to wind, to stop, to run directly on,
    his corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.
    and, in some taste, is lepidus but so:
    he must be taught, and train'd, and bid go forth;
    a barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds
    on objects, arts, and imitations,
    which, out of use and staled by other men,
    begin his fashion. do not talk of him
    but as a property. and now, octavius,
    listen great things. brutus and cassius
    are levying powers; we must straight make head;
    therefore let our alliance be combined,
    our best friends made, our means stretch'd;
    and let us presently

    now sit we close about this taper here,
    and call in question our necessities.
  cassius. portia, art thou gone?
  brutus. no more, i pray you.
    messala, i have here received letters
    that young octavius and mark antony
    come down upon us with a mighty power,
    bending their expedition toward philippi.
  messala. myself have letters of the selfsame tenure.
  brutus. with what addition?
  messala. that by proscription and bills of outlawry
    octavius, antony, and lepidus
    have put to death an hundred senators.
  brutus. there in our letters do not well agree;
    mine speak of seventy senators that died
    by their proscriptions, cicero being one.
  cassius. cicero one!
  messala. cicero is dead,
    and by that order of proscription.
    had you your letters from your wife, my lord?
  brutus. no, messala.
  messala. nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
  brutus. nothing, messala.
  messala. that, methinks, is strange.
  brutus. why ask you
