[CHARACTER] 

though younger than her sister, [CHARACTER] often acts as celie's
protector. [CHARACTER] is highly intellectual and from an early age recognizes
the value of education. however, even though [CHARACTER] is smart and
ambitious, mr. ______ effectively silences her by secretly hiding
her letters from celie. in her letters to celie, [CHARACTER] writes that
she is lonely, showing that like celie, [CHARACTER] needs a sympathetic
audience to listen to her thoughts and concerns.
	critics have faulted [CHARACTER]'s letters for being digressive
and boring in comparison to celie's. although [CHARACTER]'s letters are
indeed quite encyclopedic and contain less raw experience and emotion, they
play an important role in the novel. as a black intellectual traveling
the world in pursuit of "the uplift of black people everywhere,"
[CHARACTER] has a vastly different experience from celie. yet her letters,
which recount the problems [CHARACTER] encounters in africa, broaden
the novel's scope and show that oppression--of women by men, of blacks
by whites, and even of blacks by blacks--is universal. the imperial,
racial, and cultural conflict and oppression [CHARACTER] encounters in
africa parallel the smaller-scale abuses and hardships that celie
experiences in georgia.
