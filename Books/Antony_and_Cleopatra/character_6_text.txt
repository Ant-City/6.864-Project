come hither, come! come, come, and take a queen
worth many babes and beggars!

proculeius.
o, temperance, lady!

cleopatra.
sir, i will eat no meat; i'll not drink, sir;
if idle talk will once be accessary,
i'll not sleep neither: this mortal house i'll ruin,
do caesar what he can. know, sir, that i
will not wait pinion'd at your master's court;
nor once be chastis'd with the sober eye
of dull octavia. shall they hoist me up,
and show me to the shouting varletry
of censuring rome? rather a ditch in egypt
be gentle grave unto me! rather on nilus' mud
lay me stark-nak'd, and let the water-flies
blow me into abhorring! rather make
my country's high pyramides my gibbet,
and hang me up in chains!

proculeius.
you do extend
these thoughts of horror further than you shall
find cause in caesar.

proculeius,
what thou hast done thy master caesar knows,

caesar.
good queen, let us entreat you.

cleopatra.
o caesar, what a wounding shame is this,--
that thou vouchsafing here to visit me,
doing the honour of thy lordliness
to one so meek, that mine own servant should
parcel the sum of my disgraces by
addition of his envy! say, good caesar,
that i some lady trifles have reserv'd,
immoment toys, things of such dignity
as we greet modern friends withal; and say,
some nobler token i have kept apart
for livia and octavia, to induce
their mediation;--must i be unfolded
with one that i have bred? the gods! it smites me
beneath the fall i have.
[to seleucus.] pr'ythee go hence;
or i shall show the cinders of my spirits
through theashes of my chance.--wert thou a man,
thou wouldst have mercy on me.

caesar.
forbear, seleucus.
