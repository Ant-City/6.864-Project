'i see a ring,' said bernard, 'hanging above me. it quivers and hangs in a loop of light.'

'i see a slab of pale yellow,' said susan, 'spreading away until it meets a purple stripe.'

'i hear a sound,' said rhoda, 'cheep, chirp; cheep chirp; going up and down.'

'i see a globe,' said neville, 'hanging down in a drop against the enormous flanks of some hill.'

'i see a crimson tassel,' said jinny, 'twisted with gold threads.'

'i hear something stamping,' said louis. 'a great beast's foot is chained. it stamps, and stamps, and stamps.'

'look at the spider's web on the corner of the balcony,' said bernard. 'it has beads of water on it, drops of white light.'

'the leaves are gathered round the window like pointed ears,' said susan.

'a shadow falls on the path,' said louis, 'like an elbow bent.'

'islands of light are swimming on the grass,' said rhoda. 'they have fallen through the tre

'the birds' eyes are bright in the tunnels between the leaves,' said neville.

'the stalks are covered with harsh, short hairs,' said jinny, 'and drops of water have stuck to them.'

'a caterpillar is curled in a green ring,' said susan, 'notched with blunt feet.'

'the grey-shelled snail draws across the path and flattens the blades behind him,' said rhoda.

'and burning lights from the window-panes flash in and out on the grasses,' said louis.

'stones are cold to my feet,' said neville. 'i feel each one, round or pointed, separately.'

'the back of my hand burns,' said jinny, 'but the palm is clammy and damp with dew.'

'birds are singing up and down and in and out all round us,' said susan.

'the beast stamps; the elephant with its foot chained; the great brute on the beach stamps,' said louis.

'look at the house,' said jinny, 'with all its windows white with blinds.'

'cold water begins to run from the scullery tap,' said rhoda, 'over the mackerel in the bowl.'

'the walls are cracked with gold cracks,' said bernard, 'and there are blue, finger-shaped shadows of leaves beneath the windows.'

'now mrs constable pulls up her thick black stockings,' said susan.

'when the smoke rises, sleep curls off the roof like a mist,' said louis.

'bubbles form on the floor of the saucepan,' said jinny. 'then they rise, quicker and quicker, in a silver chain to the top.'

'now billy scrapes the fish-scales with a jagged knife on to a wooden board,' said neville.

'the dining-room window is dark blue now,' said bernard, 'and the air ripples above the chimneys.'

'a swallow is perched on the lightning-conductor,' said susan. 'and biddy has smacked down the bucket on the kitchen flags.'

'that is the first stroke of the church bell,' said louis. 'then the others follow; one, two; one, two; one,

'look at the table-cloth, flying white along the table,' said rhoda. 'now there are rounds of white china, and silver streaks beside each plate.'

'suddenly a bee booms in my ear,' said neville. 'it is here; it is past.'

'i burn, i shiver,' said jinny, 'out of this sun, into this shadow.'

'now they have all gone,' said louis. 'i am alone. they have gone into the house for breakfast, and i am left standing by the wall among the flowers. it is very early, before lessons. flower after flower is specked on the depths of green. the petals are harlequins. stalks rise from the black hollows beneath. the flowers swim like fish made of light upon the dark, green waters. i hold a stalk in my hand. i am the stalk. my roots go down to the depths of the

'i love,' said susan, 'and i hate. i desire one thing only. my eyes are hard. jinny's eyes break into a thousand lights. rhoda's are like those pale flowers to which moths come in the evening. yours grow full and brim and never break. but i am already set on my pursuit. i see insects in the grass. though my mother still knits white socks for me and hems pinafores and i am a child, i love and i hate.'

'this is here,' said jinny, 'this is now. but soon we shall go. soon miss curry will blow her whistle. we shall walk. we shall part. you will go to school. you will have masters wearing crosses with white ties. i shall have a mistress in a school on the east coast who sits under a portrait of queen alexandra. that is where i am going, and susan and rhoda. this is only here; this is only now. now we lie under the currant bushes and every time the breeze stirs we are mottled all over. my hand is like a snake's skin. my kne

'it is dull,' said jinny, 'walking along the high road with no windows to look at, with no bleared eyes of blue glass let into the pavement.'

'this is my first night at school,' said susan, 'away from my father, away from my home. my eyes swell; my eyes prick with tears. i hate the smell of pine and linoleum. i hate the wind-bitten shrubs and the sanitary tiles. i hate the cheerful jokes and the glazed look of everyone. i left my squirrel and my doves for the boy to look after. the kitchen door slams, and shot patters among the leaves when percy fires at the rooks. all here is false; all is meretricious. rhoda and jinny sit far off in brown serge, and look at miss lambert who sits under a picture of queen alexandra reading from a book before her. there is also a blue scroll of needlework embroidered by some old girl. if i do not purse my lips, if i do not screw my handkerchief, i shall cry.'

'that dark woman,' said jinny, 'with high cheek-bones, has a shiny dress, like a shell, veined, for wearing in the evening. that is nice for summer, but for winter i should like a thin dress shot with red threads that would gleam in the firelight. then when the lamps were lit, i should put on my red dress and it would be thin as a veil, and would wind about my body, and billow out as i came into the room, pirouetting. it would make a flower shape as i sank down, in the middle of the room, on a gilt chair. but miss lambert w

'when miss lambert passes,' said rhoda, 'talking to the clergyman, the others laugh and imitate her hunch behind her back; yet everything changes and becomes luminous. jinny leaps higher too when miss lambert passes. suppose she saw that daisy, it would change. wherever she goes, things are changed under her eyes; and yet when she has gone is not the thing the same again? miss lambert is taking the clergyman through the wicket-gate to her private garden; and when she comes to the pond, she sees a frog on a leaf, and that will change. all is solemn, all is pale where she stands, like a statue in a grove. she lets her tasselled silken cloak slip down, and only her pu

'i have won the game,' said jinny. 'now it is your turn. i must throw myself on the ground and pant. i am out of breath with running, with triumph. everything in my body seems thinned out with running and triumph. my blood must be bright red, whipped up, slapping against my ribs. my soles tingle, as if wire rings opened and shut in my feet. i see every blade of grass very clear. but the pulse drums so in my forehead, behind my eyes, that everything dances--the net, the grass; your faces leap like butterflies; the trees seem to

'i hate darkness and sleep and night,' said jinny, 'and lie longing for the day to come. i long that the week should be all one day without divisions. when i wake early--and the birds wake me--i lie and watch the brass handles on the cupboard grow clear; then the basin; then the towel-horse. as each thing in the bedroom grows clear, my heart beats quicker. i feel my body harden, and become pink, yellow, brown. my hands pass over my legs and body. i feel its slopes, its thinness. i love to hear the gong roar through the house and the stir begin

'i sit snug in my own corner going north,' said jinny, 'in this roaring express which is yet so smooth that it flattens hedges, lengthens hills. we flash past signal-boxes; we make the earth rock slightly from side to side. the distance closes for ever in a point; and we for ever open the distance wide again. the telegraph poles bob up incessantly; one is felled, another rises. now we roar and swing into a tunnel. the gentleman pulls up the window. i see reflections on the shining glass which lines the tunnel. i see him lower his paper. he smiles

'yes,' said jinny, 'our senses have widened. membranes, webs of nerve that lay white and limp, have filled and spread themselves and float round us like filaments, making the air tangible and catching in them far-away sounds unheard before.'

'the roar of london,' said louis, 'is round us. motor-cars, vans, omnibuses pass and repass continuously. all are merged in one turning wheel of single sound. all separate sounds--wheels, bells, the cries of drunkards, of merrymakers--are churned into one sound, steel blue,

'it is love,' said jinny, 'it is hate, such as susan feels for me because i kissed louis once in the garden; because equipped as i am, i make her think when i come in, "my hands are red," and hide them. but our hatred is almost indistinguishable from our love.'

'yes, between your shoulders, over your heads, to a landscape,' said rhoda, 'to a hollow where the many-backed steep hills come down like birds' wings folded. there, on the short, firm turf, are bushes, dark leaved, and against their darkness i see a shape, white, but not of stone, moving, perhaps alive. but it is not you, it is not you, it is not you; not percival, susan, jinny, neville or louis. when the white arm rests upon the knee it is a triangle; now it is upright--a column; now a fountain, falling. it makes no sign, it does not beckon, it does not see us. behind it roars the sea. it is beyond our reach. yet there i venture. there i go to replenish my emptiness, to stretch my nights and fill them fuller and fuller with dreams. and for a second even now, even here, i reach my object and say, "wander no more. all else is trial and make-believe. here is the end." b

'but his slippers?' said neville. 'and his voice downstairs in the hall? and catching sight of him when he does not see one? one waits and he does not come. it gets later and later. he has forgotten. he is with someone else. he is faithless, his love meant nothing. oh, then the agony--then the intolerable despair! and then the door opens. he is here.'

'ripping gold, i say to him, "come",' said jinny. 'and he comes; he crosses the room to where i sit, with my dress like a veil billowing round me on the gilt chair. our hands touch, our bodies burst into fire. the chair, the cup, the table--nothing remains unlit. all quivers, all kindles, all burns clear.'

'death is woven in with the violets,' said louis. 'death and again death.')

'how proudly we sit here,' said jinny, 'we who are not yet twenty-five! outside the trees flower; outside the women linger; outside the cabs swerve and sweep. emerged from the tentative ways, the obscurities and dazzle of youth, we look straight in front of us, ready for what may come (the door opens, the door keeps on opening). all is real; all is firm without shadow or illusion. beauty rides our brows. there is mine, there is susan's. our flesh is firm and cool. our differences are clear-cut as the shadows of rocks in full sunlig

'they are immune,' said rhoda, 'from picking fingers and searching eyes. how easily they turn and glance; what poses they take of energy and pride! what life shines in jinny's eyes; how fell, how entire susan's glance is, searching for insects at the roots! their hair shines lustrous. their eyes burn like the eyes of animals brushing through leaves on the scent of the prey. the circle is destroyed. we are thrown asunder.'

'let us hold it for one moment,' said jinny; 'love, hatred, by whatever name we call it, this globe whose walls are made of percival, of youth and beauty, and something so deep sunk within us that we shall perhaps never make this moment out of one man again.'

'forests and far countries on the other side of the world,' said rhoda, 'are in it; seas and jungles; the howlings of jackals and moonlight falling upon some high peak where the eagle soars.'

"listen," i say, "to the nightingale, who sings among the trampling feet; the conquests and migrations. believe--" and then am twitched asunder. over broken tiles and splinters of glass i pick my way. different lights fall, making the ordinary leopard spotted and strange. this moment of reconci

'in this silence,' said susan, 'it seems as if no leaf would ever fall, or bird fly.'

'as if the miracle had happened,' said jinny, 'and life were stayed here and now.'

'and,' said rhoda, 'we had no more to live.'

'but listen,' said louis, 'to the world moving through abysses of infinite space. it roars; the lighted strip of history is past and our kings and queens; we are gone; our civilization; the nile; and all life. our separate drops are dissolved; we are extinct, lost in the abysses of time, in the darkness.'

'oppose ourselves to this illimitable chaos,' said neville, 'this formless imbecility. making love to a nursemaid behind a tree, that soldier is more admirable than all the stars. yet sometimes one trembling star comes in the clear sky and makes me think the world beautiful and we maggots deforming even the trees with our lust.'

('yet, louis,' said rhoda, 'how short a time silence lasts. already they are beginning to smooth their napkins by the side of their plates. "who comes?" says jinny; and neville sighs, remembering that percival comes no more. jinny has taken out her looking-glass. surveying her face like an artist, she draws a powder-puff down her nose, and after one moment of deliberation has given precisely that red to the lips that the lips need. susan, who feels scorn and fear at the sight of these preparations, fastens the top button of her coat, and unfastens it. what is she making ready for? for something, but something different.'

'while we advance down this avenue,' said louis, 'i leaning slightly upon jinny, bernard arm-in-arm with neville, and susan with her hand in mine, it is difficult not to weep, calling ourselves little children, praying that god may keep us safe while we sleep. it is sweet to sing together, clasping hands, afraid of the dark, while miss curry plays the harmonium.'

'a mysterious illumination,' said louis, 'visible against those yew trees.'

'they vanish, towards the lake,' said rhoda. 'they slink away over the grass furtively, yet with assurance as if they asked of our pity their ancient privilege--not to be disturbed. the tide in the soul, tipped, flows that way; they cannot help deserting us. the dark has closed over their bodies. what song do we

'now,' said rhoda, 'as they pass that tree, they regain their natural size. they are only men, only women. wonder and awe change as they put off the draperies of the flowing tide. pity returns, as they emerge into the moonlight, like the relics of an army, our representatives, going every night (here or in greece) to battle, and coming back every night with their wounds, their ravaged faces. now light falls on them again. they have faces. they become susan and bernard, jinny and neville, people we know. now what a shrinkage takes place! now what a shrivelling, what an humiliation! the old shivers run through me, hatred and terror, as i feel myself grappled to one spot by these hooks they cast on us; these greetings, recognitions, pluckings of the finger and searchings of the eyes. yet they have only to speak, and their first words, with the remembered tone and the perpetual deviation from what one expects, and their hands moving and making a thousand past days rise

'we have destroyed something by our presence,' said bernard, 'a world perhaps.'

'yet we scarcely breathe,' said neville, 'spent as we are. we are in that passive and exhausted frame of mind when we only wish to rejoin the body of our mother from whom we have been severed. all else is distasteful, forced and fatiguing. jinny's yellow scarf is moth-coloured in this light; susan's eyes are quenched. we are scarcely to be distinguished from the river. one cigarette end is the only point of emph

'still i gape,' said susan, 'like a young bird, unsatisfied, for something that has escaped me.'

d implore them not to squeeze the sponge over that new body. then, there was the garden and the canopy of the currant leaves which seemed to enclose everything; flowers, burning like sparks upon the depths of green; a rat wreathing with maggots under a rhubarb leaf; the fly going buzz, buzz, buzz upon the nursery ceiling, and plates upon plates of innocent bread and butter. all these things happen in one second and last for ever. faces loom. dashing round the corner. "hullo," one says, "there's jinny. that's neville. that's louis in grey flannel with a snake belt. that's rhoda." she had a basin in which she sailed petals of white flowers. it was susan who cried, that day when i was in the tool-house with neville; and i felt my indifference melt. neville did not melt. "therefore," i said, "i am myself, not neville", a wonderful discovery. susan cried and i followed her. her wet pocket-handkerchief, and the sight of her little back heaving up and down like a pump-handle, sobbing for what was

ax that coats the spine melted in different patches for each of us. the growl of the boot-boy making love to the tweeny among the gooseberry bushes; the clothes blown out hard on the line; the dead man in the gutter; the apple tree, stark in the moonlight; the rat swarming with maggots; the lustre dripping blue--our white wax was streaked and stained by each of these differently. louis was disgusted by the nature of human flesh; rhoda by our cruelty; susan could not share; neville wanted order; jinny love; and so on. we suffered terribly as we became separate bodies.

'jinny was the first to come sidling up to the gate to eat sugar. she nipped it off the palms of one's hands very cleverly, but her ears were laid back as if she might bite. rhoda was wild--rhoda one never could catch. she was both frightened and clumsy. it was susan who first became wholly woman, purely feminine.

'the willow tree grew by the river. i sat on the smooth turf with neville, with larpent, with baker, romsey, hughes, percival and jinny. through its fine plumes specked with little pricked ears of green in spring, of orange in autumn, i saw boats; buildings; i saw hurrying, decrepit women. i buried match after match in the turf decidedly to mark this or that stage in the process of understanding (it might be philosophy; science; it might be myself) while the fringe of my intelligence floating unattached caught those distant sensations which after a time the mind draws in and works upon; the chime of bells; general murmurs; vani

nt. we have our fundamental goodness surely or to talk as i talk freely to someone i hardly know would be impossible--we should cease. the willow as she saw it grew on the verge of a grey desert where no bird sang. the leaves shrivelled as she looked at them, tossed in agony as she passed them. the trams and omnibuses roared hoarse in the street ran over rocks and sped foaming away. perhaps one pillar, sunlit, stood in her desert by a pool where wild beasts come down stealthily to drink.

'then jinny came. she flashed her fire over the tree. she was like a crinkled poppy, febrile, thirsty with the desire to drink dry dust. darting, angular, not in the least impulsive, she came prepared. so little flames zigzag over the cracks in the dry earth. she made the willows dance, but not with illusion; for she saw nothing that was not there. it was a tree; there was the river; it was afternoon; here we were; i in my serge suit; she in green. there was no past, no future; merely the moment in its rin

with my eyes filmed, not with pride, but with humility rather, i walked down the street. the first whirr of wings had gone up, the carol, the exclamation; and now one enters; one goes into the house, the dry, uncompromising, inhabited house, the place with all its traditions, its objects, its accumulations of rubbish, and treasures displayed upon tables. i visited the family tailor, who remembered my uncle. people turned up in great quantities, not cut out, like the first faces (neville, louis, jinny, susan, rhoda), but confused, featureless, or changed their features so fast that they seemed to have none. and blushing yet scornful, in the oddest condition of raw rapture and scepticism, i took the blow; the mixed sensations; the complex and disturbing and utterly unprepared for impacts of life all over, in all places, at the same time. how upsetting! how humiliating never to be sure what to say next, and those painful silences, glaring as dry deserts, with every pebble apparent; and then to

'so the sincerity of the moment passed; so it became symbolical; and that i could not stand. let us commit any blasphemy of laughter and criticism rather than exude this lily-sweet glue; and cover him with phrases, i cried. therefore i broke off, and jinny, who was without future, or speculation, but respected the moment with complete integrity, gave her body a flick with the whip, powdered her face (for which i loved her), and waved to me as she stood on the doorstep, pressing her hand to her hair so that the wind might not disorder it, a gesture for which i honoured her, as if it confirmed our determination--not to let lilies grow.

'i observed with disillusioned clarity the despicable nonentity of the street; its porches; its window curtains;

'was there no sword, nothing with which to batter down these walls, this protection, this begetting of children and living behind curtains, and becoming daily more involved and committed, with books and pictures? better burn one's life out like louis, desiring perfection; or like rhoda leave us, flying past us to the desert; or choose one out of millions and one only like neville; better be like susan and love and hate the heat of the sun or the frost-bitten grass; or be like jinny, honest, an animal. all had their rapture; their common feeling with death; something that stood them in stead. thus i visited each of my friends in turn, trying, with fumbling fingers, to prise open their locked caskets. i went from one to the other holding my sorrow--no, not my sorrow but the incomprehensible nature of this our life--for their inspection. some people go to priests; others to poetry; i to my friends, i to my own heart, i to seek among phrases and fragments something unbroken--

"but i no longer rise at dawn," she said. then jinny--entertaining, no doubt, some new young man. they reached the crisis of the usual conversation. the room would be darkened; chairs arranged. for she still sought the moment. without illusions, hard and clear as crystal, she rode at the day with her breast bared. she let its spikes pierce her. when the lock whitened on her forehead she twisted it fearlessly among the rest. so when they come to bury her nothing will be out of order. bits of ribbons will be found curled up. but still the door open

heltered her love; and the squeak of trams mixed with her cry of delight and the rippling of leaves had to shade her languor, her delicious lassitude as she sank down cooled by all the sweetness of nature satisfied. our friends, how seldom visited, how little known--it is true; and yet, when i meet an unknown person, and try to break off, here at this table, what i call "my life", it is not one life that i look back upon; i am not one person; i am many people; i do not altogether know who i am--jinny, susan, neville, rhoda, or louis; or how to distinguish my life from theirs.

'so i thought that night in early autumn when we came together and dined once more at hampton court. our discomfort was at first considerable, for each by that time was committed to a statement, and the other person coming along the road to the meeting-place dressed like this or that, with a stick or without, seemed to contradict it. i saw jinny look at susan's earthy fingers and then hide her own; i, considering nevi

'was this, then, this streaming away mixed with susan, jinny, neville, rhoda, louis, a sort of death? a new assembly of elements? some hint of what was to come? the note was scribbled, the book shut, for i am an intermittent student. i do not say my lessons by any means at the stated hour. later, walking down fleet street at the rush hour, i recalled that moment; i continued it.

"wait," i said, putting my arm in imagination (thus we consort with our friends) through her arm. "wait until these omnibuses have gone by. do not cross so dangerously. these men are your brothers." in persuading her i was also persuading my own soul. for this is not one life; nor do i always know if i am man or woman, bernard or neville, louis, susan, jinny, or rhoda--so strange is the contact of one with another.

'swinging my stick, with my hair newly cut and the nape of my neck tingling, i went past all those trays of penny toys imported from germany that men hold out in the street by st paul's--st paul's, the brooding hen with spread wings from whose shelter run omnibuses and streams of men and women at the rush hour. i thought how louis would mount those steps in his neat suit with his cane in his hand and his angular, rather detached gait. w
