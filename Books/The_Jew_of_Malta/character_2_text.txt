     i fear she knows--'tis so--of my device
     in don mathias' and lodovico's deaths:
     if so, 'tis time that it be seen into;

     ne'er shall she grieve me more with her disgrace;
     ne'er shall she live to inherit aught of mine,
     be bless'd of me, nor come within my gates,
     but perish underneath my bitter curse,
     like cain by adam for his brother's death.

     i fear me he mistrusts what we intend.

     saw me; and who would not requite such love?  here's her house;
     and here she comes; and now would i were gone!  i am not worthy

     barabas. pardonnez moi, monsieur; me [178] be no well.

     pilia-borza. farewell, fiddler [exit barabas.] one letter more
     to the jew.

     bellamira. prithee, sweet love, one more, and write it sharp.

     ithamore. no, i'll send by word of mouth now.
     --bid him deliver thee a thousand crowns, by the same token
     that the nuns loved rice, that friar barnardine slept in his
     own clothes; any of 'em will do it.

     pilia-borza. let me alone to urge it, now i know the meaning.

     ithamore. the meaning has a meaning.  come, let's in:
     to undo a jew is charity, and not sin.

     pilia-borza. who, besides the slaughter of these gentlemen,
     poison'd his own daughter and the nuns,
     strangled a friar, and i know not what
     mischief beside.

     ferneze. had we but proof of this----

     bellamira. strong proof, my lord:  his man's now at my lodging,
     that was his agent; he'll confess it all.

     ferneze. go fetch him [180] straight [exeunt officers].
     i always fear'd that jew.

     barabas. i'll go alone; dogs, do not hale me thus.

     ithamore.

     ithamore. guilty, my lord, i confess.  your son and mathias
     were both contracted unto abigail: [he] forged a counterfeit
     challenge.

     barabas. who carried that challenge?

     ithamore.
     i carried it, i confess; but who writ it? marry, even he that
     strangled barnardine, poisoned the nuns and his own daughter.

     ferneze. away with him! his sight is death to me.

     barabas. for what, you men of malta? hear me speak.
     she is a courtezan, and he a thief,
     and he my bondman:  let me have law;
     for none of this can prejudice my life.

     ferneze, 'twas thy son that murder'd him.

     ferneze. be patient, gentle madam:  it was he;
     he forg'd the daring challenge made them fight.
