he fence and tied him to it with a thong and left food beside him to eat and some
fresh water. before long he was on his feet, gnawing through the thong. he howled and ran about the yard while i cooked my
supper. all night he howled, but at dawn when i went out of the house, he was asleep.
while he lay there by the fence sleeping, i thought of different names for him, trying first one and then another, saying them 
over to myself. at last, because he looked so much like his father, i called him rontu-aru, which means son of rontu.
in a short time he made friends with me. he was not so large as rontu, but he had his father's thick coat and the same yellow
eyes. often when i watched him chasing gulls on the sandpits or on the reef barking at the otter, i forgot that he was not
rontu.
we had many happy times that summer, fishing and going to tall rock in our canoe, but more and more now i thought of
tutok and my sister ulape. sometimes i would hear their voices in the wind and often, when i was on

 and though j was afraid to leave the cliff i knew that i could never stay there until morning, that i would go to
sleep and fall. neither could i find my way home, so i climbed down from the ledge and crouched at the foot of the cliff.
dawn was windless and hot. the sandpits was strewn with hills of kelp. dead fish and lobsters and pink crabs lay
everywhere, and two small whales were stranded against the rock walls of the cove. far up the trail that led to the mesa i
found things from the sea.
rontu-aru was waiting at the fence. when i crawled under it he jumped upon me and followed me around, never letting me
out of his sight.
i was glad to be home on the high headland where the waves had not come. i had been gone only from one sun to the next,
yet it was like many suns, like the time i had gone away in the canoe. most of the day i slept, but i had many dreams and
when i awoke everything around me was strange. the sea made no sounds on the shore. the gulls were quiet. the earth
seemed to be h

olding its breath, as though it were waiting for something terrible to happen.
at dusk i was coming back from the spring with a basket of water on my shoulder, walking along the cliff with rontu-aru.
everywhere, the ocean was smooth and yellow and it lay against the island as if it were very tired. the gulls were still quiet,
perched on their rocky nests.
slowly the earth began to move. it moved away from my feet and for a moment i seemed to be standing in the air. water
tipped out of the basket and trickled over my face. then the basket fell to the ground. not knowing what i did, thinking
foolishly that' another wave was upon me, i began to run. but it was a wave, a wave of earth, and it

and came along the beach and up the trail.
i could not see him, but after a while i heard a shout, then another, and i knew that he had found my fire and the canoe. the
man he had left in the cove did not answer, nor did the men on the ship, so i was sure that he was calling to me.
i crawled down from the rock and went to the house. since my shoulders were bare, i put on my otter cape. i took my
cormorant skirt and the abalone box in which i kept my necklace and ear-rings. with rontu-aru i then went along the trail
that led to coral cove. 
i came to the mound where my ancestors had sometimes camped in the summer. i thought of them and of the happy times
spent in my house on the headland, of my canoe lying unfinished beside the trail. i thought of many things, but stronger was
the wish to be where people lived, to hear their voices and their laughter.
i left the mound and the green grass growing on it among the white shells. i could no longer hear the man calling, so i began

 black stones and the black ear-rings. with blue clay i made the mark of our
tribe across my nose.
then i did something that made me smile at myself. i did what my older sister ulape had done when she left the island of the
blue dolphins. below the mark of our tribe i carefully made the sign which meant that i was still unmarried. i was no longer
a girl, yet i made it anyway, using the blue clay and some white clay for the dots.
i went back to the house then and built a fire and cooked food for rontu-aru and me. i was not hungry and he ate my food 
and his too.
'we are going away,' i said to him, 'away from our island.'
but he only put his head to one side, as his father often had done, and when i said no more, he trotted out to a sunny place
and. lay down and fell asleep.
now that the white men had come back, i could not think of what i would do when i went across the sea, or make a picture in
my mind of the white men and what they did there, or see my people who had been gone so long. nor, th

of the blue dolphins. the last thing i saw of it was the high headland. i
thought of rontu lying there beneath the stones of many colours, and of won-a-nee, wherever she was, and the little red fox
that would scratch in vain at my fence, and my canoe hidden in the cave, and of all the happy days. 
dolphins rose out of the sea and swam before the ship. they swam for many leagues in the morning through the bright water,
weaving their foam patterns. the little birds were chirping in their cage and rontu-aru sat beside me.
author's note
the island called in this book the island of the blue dolphins was first settled by indians in about 2000 b.c., but it was not
discovered by white men until i602.
in that year the spanish explorer sebasti~n vizcaino set out from mexico in search of a port where treasure galleons from the
philippines could find shelter in case of distress. sailing north along the california coast, he sighted the island, sent a small
boat ashore and named it la isla de san nicolas, in
