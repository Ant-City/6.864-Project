[CHARACTER]

at first, the narrator depicts [CHARACTER] as simple-minded and agreeable, but as
surfacing progresses, [CHARACTER]'s personality undergoes changes.
where once he seemed content, he becomes irritable and sullen when the narrator
refuses his marriage proposal. also, [CHARACTER]'s actions become less predictable. his
proposal is unexpected, and the narrator becomes less able to discern [CHARACTER]'s
intentions. when david asks anna to be filmed naked and [CHARACTER] defends her, the
narrator has trouble discerning whether [CHARACTER] is helping a friend or seeking a way
to become sexually aroused. the narrator shows herself to be unreliable in
depicting [CHARACTER] objectively. for example, she keeps bracing herself for a hit from
[CHARACTER] that never comes.
as her impressions of [CHARACTER] fluctuate, the narrator's impression of their
love also shifts. initially, the narrator downplays [CHARACTER]'s love for her. she
believes that [CHARACTER] wants to marry her out of a conceptual ideal and not out of
affection. the narrator also downplays her love for [CHARACTER], claiming she only
enjoys [CHARACTER] for his physical qualities. however, surfacing ends
with legitimate love between the two, and [CHARACTER] displays his sincere affection for
the narrator when he searches for her on the island. despite this love, the
narrator filters [CHARACTER]'s actions through her own biases, making his true character
unknowable.
