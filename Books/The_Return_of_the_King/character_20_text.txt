or is it over? and when do they have dinner, and where?’
presently he noticed a man, clad in black and white, coming along the narrow street from the centre of the citadel towards him. pippin felt lonely and made up his mind to speak as the man passed; but he had no need. the man came straight up to him.
‘you are peregrin the halfling?’ he said. ‘i am told that you have been sworn to the service of the lord and of the city. welcome! he held out his hand and pippin took it.
‘i am named beregond son of baranor. i have no duty this morning, and i have been sent to you to teach you the pass-words, and to tell you some of the many things that no doubt you will wish to know. and for my part, i would learn of you also. for never before have we seen a halfling in this land and though we have heard rumour of them, little is said of them in any tale that we know. moreover you are a friend of mithrandir. do you know him well?’
‘well,’ said pippin. ‘i have known of him all my short life,

 as you might say; and lately i have travelled far with him. but there is much to read in that book, and i cannot claim to have seen more than a page or two. yet perhaps i know him as well as any but a few. aragorn was the only one of our company, i think, who really knew him.’
‘aragorn?’ said beregond. ‘who is he?’
‘oh,’ stammered pippin, ‘he was a man who went about with us. i think he is in rohan now.’
‘you have been in rohan, i hear. there is much that i would ask you of that land also; for we put much of what little hope we have in its people. but i am forgetting my errand, which was first to answer what you would ask. what would you know, master peregrin?’
‘er well,’ said pippin, ‘if i may venture to say so, rather a burning question in my mind at present is, well,

 what about breakfast and all that? i mean, what are the meal-times, if you understand me, and where is the dining-room, if there is one? and the inns? i looked, but never a one could i see as we rode up, though i had been borne up by the hope of a draught of ale as soon as we came to the homes of wise and courtly men.’
beregond looked at him gravely. ‘an old campaigner, i see,’ he said. ‘they say that men who go warring afield look ever to the next hope of food and of drink; though i am not a travelled man myself. then you have not yet eaten today?’
‘well, yes, to speak in courtesy, yes,’ said pippin. ‘but no more than a cup of wine and a white cake or two by the kindness of your lord; but he racked me for it with an hour of questions, and that is hungry work.’
beregond laughed. ‘at the table small m

‘hobbit?’ said beregond.
‘that is what we call ourselves,’ said pippin.
‘i am glad to learn it,’ said beregond, ‘for now i may say that strange accents do not mar fair speech, and hobbits are a fair-spoken folk. but come! you shall make me acquainted with this good horse. i love beasts, and we see them seldom in this stony city; for my people came from the mountain-vales, and before that from ithilien. but fear not! the visit shall be short, a mere call of courtesy, and we will go thence to the butteries.’

 errand-riders of the lord: messengers always ready to go at the urgent command of denethor or his chief captains. but now all the horses and the riders were out and away.
shadowfax whinnied as pippin entered the stable and turned his head. ‘good morning!’ said pippin. ‘gandalf will come as soon as he may. he is busy, but he sends greetings, and i am to see that all is well with you; and you resting, i hope, after your long labours.’
shadowfax tossed his head and stamped. but he allowed beregond to handle his head gently and stroke his great flanks.
‘he looks as if he were spoiling for a race, and not newly come from a great journey,’ said beregond. ‘how strong and proud he is! where is his harness? it should be rich and fair.’
‘none is rich and fair enough for him,’ said pippin. ‘he will have none. if he will consent to bear you, bear you he does; and if not, well, no bit, bridle, whip, or thong will tame him. farewell, shadowfax! have patience. battle is coming.’

owfax lifted up his head and neighed, so that the stable shook, and they covered their ears. then they took their leave, seeing that the manger was well filled.
‘and now for our manger,’ said beregond, and he led pippin back to the citadel, and so to a door in the north side of the great tower. there they went down a long cool stair into a wide alley lit with lamps. there were hatches in the walls at the side, and one of these was open.
‘this is the storehouse and buttery of my company of the guard.’ said beregond. ‘greetings, targon!’ he called through the hatch. ‘it is early yet, but here is a newcomer that the lord has taken into his service. he has ridden long and far with a ti

they got there bread, and butter, and cheese and apples: the last of the winter store, wrinkled but sound and sweet; and a leather flagon of new-drawn ale, and wooden platters and cups. they put all into a wicker basket and climbed back into the sun; and beregond brought pippin to a place at the east end of the great out-thrust battlement where there was an embrasure in the walls with a stone seat beneath the sill. from there they could look out on the morning over the world.
they ate and drank; and they talked now of gondor and its ways and customs, now of the shire and the strange countries that pippin had seen. and ever as they talked beregond was more amazed, and looked with greater wonder at the hobbit, swinging his short legs as he sat on the seat

‘i will not hide from you, master peregrin,’ said beregond, ‘that to us you look almost as one of our children, a lad of nine summers or so; and yet you have endured perils and seen marvels that few of our greybeards could boast of. i thought it was the whim of our lord to take him a noble page, after the manner of the kings of old, they say. but i see that it is not so, and you must pardon my foolishness.’

galloped to and fro, but all the street seemed to be choked with great covered wains going south. but soon pippin saw that all was in fact well-ordered: the wains were moving in three lines, one swifter drawn by horses; another slower, great waggons with fair housings of many colours, drawn by oxen; and along the west rim of the road many smaller carts hauled by trudging men.
‘that is the road to the vales of tumladen and lossarnach, and the mountain-villages, and then on to lebennin,’ said beregond. ‘there go the last of the wains that bear away to refuge the aged the children, and the women that must go with them. they must all be gone from the gate and the road clear for a league before noon: that was the order. it is a sad necessity.’ he sighed. ‘few, maybe, of those now sundered will meet again. and there were always too few children in this city; but now there are none-save some young lads that will not depart, and may find some task to do: my own son is one of them.’

‘it was a city,’ said beregond, ‘the chief city of gondor, of which this was only a fortress. for that is the ruin of osgiliath on either side of anduin, which our enemies took and burned long ago. yet we won it back in the days of the youth of denethor: not to dwell in, but to hold as an outpost, and to rebuild the bridge for the passage of our arms. and then came the fell riders out of minas morgul.’
‘the black riders?’ said pippin, opening his eyes, and they were wide and dark with an old fear re-awakened.
‘yes,

 they were black,’ said beregond, ‘and i see that you know something of them, though you have not spoken of them in any of your tales.’
‘i know of them,’ said pippin softly, ‘but i will not speak of them now, so near, so near.’ he broke off and lifted his eyes above the river, and it seemed to him that all he could see was a vast and threatening shadow. perhaps it was mountains looming on the verge of sight, their jagged edges softened by wellnigh twenty leagues of misty air; perhaps it was but a cloud-wall, and be

yond that again a yet deeper gloom. but even as he looked it seemed to his eyes that the gloom was growing and gathering, very slowly, slowly rising to smother the regions of the sun.
‘so near to mordor?’ said beregond quietly. ‘yes, there it lies. we seldom name it; but we have dwelt ever in sight of that shadow: sometimes it seems fainter and more distant; sometimes nearer and darker. it is growing and darkening now; and therefore our fear and disquiet grow too. and the fell riders, less than a year ago they won back the crossings, and many of our best men were slain. boromir it was that drove the enemy at last back from this western shore, and we hold still the near half of osgiliath. for a little while.

 but we await now a new onslaught there. maybe the chief onslaught of the war that comes.’
‘when?’ said pippin. ‘have you a guess? for i saw the beacons last night and the errand-riders; and gandalf said that it was a sign that war had begun. he seemed in a desperate hurry. but now everything seems to have slowed up again.’
‘only because everything is now ready,’ said beregond. ‘it is but the deep breath before the plunge.’
‘but why were the beacons lit last night?’
‘it is over-late to send for aid when you are already besieged,’ answered beregond. ‘but i do not know the counsel of the lord and his captains. they have many ways of gathering news. and the lord denethor is unlike other men: he sees far. some say that as he sits alone in his high chamber in the tower at night, and bends his thought this way and that, he can read somewhat of the future; and

‘what was that?’ asked beregond. ‘you also felt something?’
‘yes,’ muttered pippin. ‘it is the sign of our fall, and the shadow of doom, a fell rider of the air.’
‘yes, the shadow of doom,’ said beregond. ‘i fear that minas tirith shall fall. night comes. the very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.’
for a time they sat together with bowed heads and did not speak. then suddenly pippin looked up and saw that the sun was still shining and the banners still streaming in the breeze. he shook himself. ‘it i

s passed,’ he said. ‘no, my heart will not yet despair. gandalf fell and has returned and is with us. we may stand, if only on one leg, or at least be left still upon our knees.’
‘rightly said!’ cried beregond, rising and striding to and fro. ‘nay, though all things must come utterly to an end in time, gondor shall not perish yet. not though the walls be taken by a reckless foe that will build a hill of carrion before them. there are still other fastnesses, and secret ways of escape into the mountains. hope and memory shall live still in some hidden valley where the grass is green.’
‘all the same, i wish it was over for good or ill.’ said pippin. ‘i am no warrior at all and dislike any thou

‘ah, there you lay your finger on the sore that many feel!’ said beregond. ‘but things may change when faramir returns. he is bold, more bold than many deem; for in these days men are slow to believe that a captain can be wise and learned in the scrolls of lore and song, as he is, and yet a man of hardihood and swift judgement in the field. but such is faramir. less reckless and eager than boromir, but not less resolute. yet what indeed can he do? we cannot assault the mountains of - of yonder realm. our reach is shortened, and we cannot strike till some foe comes

 tall and proud and noble, as all the men that he had yet seen in that land; and with a glitter in his eye as he thought of the battle. ‘alas! my own hand feels as light as a feather,’ he thought, but he said nothing. ‘a pawn did gandalf say? perhaps but on the wrong chessboard.’
so they talked until the sun reached its height, and suddenly the noon-bells were rung, and there was a stir in the citadel; for all save the watchmen were going to their meal.
‘will you come with me?’ said beregond. ‘you may join my mess for this day. i do not know to what company you will be assigned; or the lord may hold you at his own command. but you will be welcome. and it will be well to meet as many men as you may, while there is yet time.’
‘i shall be glad to come,’ said pippin. ‘i am lonely, to tell you the truth. i left my best friend behind in rohan, and i have had no one to talk to or jest with. perhaps i could really join your company? are you the captain? if so, you could take me o

n, or speak for me?’
‘nay, nay,’ beregond laughed, ‘i am no captain. neither office nor rank nor lordship have i, being but a plain man of arms of the third company of the citadel. yet, master peregrin, to be only a man of arms of the guard of the tower of gondor is held worthy in the city, and such men have honour in the land.’
‘then it is far beyond me,’ said pippin. ‘take me back to our room, and if gandalf is not there, i will go where you like - as your guest.’
gandalf was not in the lodging and had sent no message; so

 pippin went with beregond and was made known to the men of the third company. and it seemed that beregond got as much honour from it as his guest, for pippin was very welcome. there had already been much talk in the citadel about mithrandir’s companion and his long closeting with the lord; and rumour declared that a prince of the halflings had come out of the north to offer allegiance to gondor and five thousand swords. and some said that when the riders came from rohan each would bring behind him a halfling warrior, small maybe, but doughty.

tale, he could not be rid of his new rank, only fitting, men thought, to one befriended by boromir and honoured by the lord denethor; and they thanked him for coming among them, and hung on his words and stories of the outlands, and gave him as much food and ale as he could wish. indeed his only trouble was to be ‘wary’ according to the counsel of gandalf, and not to let his tongue wag freely after the manner of a hobbit among friends.
at length beregond rose. ‘farewell for this time!’ he said. ‘i have duty now till sundown, as have all the others here, i think. but if you are lonely, as you say, maybe you would like a merry guide about the city. my son would go with you gladly. a good lad, i may say. if that pleases you, go down to the lowest circle and ask for the old guesthouse in the rath celerdain, the lampwrights’ street. you will find him there with other lads that are remaining in the city. there may be things worth seeing down

aken me for a soft stranger-lad and easy prey, let me warn you: i am not, i am a halfling, hard, bold, and wicked!’ pippin pulled such a grim face that the boy stepped back a pace, but at once he returned with clenched fists and the light of battle in his eye.
‘no!’ pippin laughed. ‘don’t believe what strangers say of themselves either! i am not a fighter. but it would be politer in any case for the challenger to say who he is.’
the boy drew himself up proudly. ‘i am bergil son of beregond of the guards,’ he said.
‘so i thought,’ said pippin, ‘for you look like your father. i know him and he sent me to find you.’
‘then why did you not say so at once?’ said bergil, and suddenly a look of dismay came over his face. ‘do not tell me that he has changed his mind, and will send me away with the maidens! but no, the last wains have gone.’
‘his message is less bad than that, if not good.’ said pippin. ‘he says that if you would prefer it to standing me on my head,

. we might have journeyed to lossarnach, to my grandsire’s house; it is good to be there in spring, the woods and fields are full of flowers. but maybe we will go thither together yet. they will never overcome our lord, and my father is very valiant. farewell and return!’
they parted and pippin hurried back towards the citadel. it seemed a long way, and he grew hot and very hungry; and night closed down swift and dark. not a star pricked the sky. he was late for the daymeal in the mess, and beregond greeted him gladly, and sat him at his side to hear news of his son. after the meal pippin stayed a while, and then took his leave, for a strange gloom was on him, and now he desired very much to see gandalf again.
‘can you find your way?’ said beregond at the door of the small hall, on the north side of the citadel, where they had sat. ‘it is a black night, and all the blacker since orders came that lights are to be dimmed within the city, and none are to shine out from the walls. and i

about the eleventh hour, released at last for a while from service. pippin came out and went in search of food and drink to cheer his heavy heart and make his task of waiting more supportable. in the messes he met beregond again, who had just come from an errand over the pelennor out to the guard-towers upon the causeway. together they strolled out to the walls; for pippin felt imprisoned indoors, and stifled even in the lofty citadel. now they sat side by side again in the embrasure looking eastward, where they had eaten and talked the day before.

in some other time and place pippin might have been pleased with his new array, but he knew now that he was taking part in no play; he was in deadly earnest the servant of a grim master in the greatest peril. the hauberk was burdensome, and the helm weighed upon his head. his cloak he had cast aside upon the seat. he turned his tired gaze away from the darkling fields below and yawned, and then he sighed.
‘you are weary of this day?’ said beregond.
‘yes,’ said pippin, ‘very: tired out with idleness and waiting. i have kicked my heels at the door of my master’s chamber for many slow hours, while he has debated with gandalf and the prince and other great persons. and i’m not used, master beregond, to waiting hungry on others while they eat. it is a sore trial for a hobbit, that. no doubt you will think i should feel the honour more deeply. but what is the good of such honour? indeed what is the good even of food and drink under t

‘nay,’ said beregond, ‘this is no weather of the world. this is some device of his malice; some broil of fume from the mountain of fire that he sends to darken hearts and counsel. and so it doth indeed. i wish the lord faramir would return. he would not be dismayed. but now, who knows if he will ever come back across the river out of the darkness?’
‘yes,’ said pippin, ‘gandalf, too, is anxious. he was disappointed. i think, not to find faramir here. and where has he got to himself? he left the lord’s co

suddenly as they talked they were stricken dumb, frozen as it were to listening stones. pippin cowered down with his hands pressed to his ears; but beregond, who had been looking out from the battlement as he spoke of faramir, remained there, stiffened, staring out with starting eyes. pippin knew the shuddering cry that he had heard: it was the same that he had heard long ago in the marish of the shire, but now it was grown in power and hatred, piercing the heart with a poisonous despair.
at last beregond spoke with an effort. ‘they have come!’ he said. ‘take courage and look! there are fell things below.’
reluctantly pippin climbed on to t

he seat and looked out over the wall. the pelennor lay dim beneath him, fading away to the scarce guessed line of the great river. but now wheeling swiftly across it, like shadows of untimely night, he saw in the middle airs below him five birdlike forms, horrible as carrion-fowl yet greater than eagles, cruel as death. now they swooped near, venturing almost within bowshot of the walls, now they circled away.
‘black riders!’ muttered pippin. ‘black riders of the air! but see, beregond!’ he cried. ‘they are looking for something, surely? see how they wheel and swoop, always down to that point over there! and can you see something moving on the ground? dark little things. yes, men on horses: four or five. ah! i cannot stand it! gandalf! gandalf save us!’
another long screech rose and fell, and he threw himself back again from the wall, panting like a hunted animal. faint and seemingly remote through that shuddering cry he heard winding up from below the sound of a trumpe

with that beregond sprang away and ran off

into the gloom. ashamed of his terror, while beregond of the guard thought first of the captain whom he loved, pippin got up and peered out. at that moment he caught a flash of white and silver coming from the north, like a small star down on the dusky fields. it moved with the speed of an arrow and grew as it came, converging swiftly with the flight of the four men towards the gate. it seemed to pippin that a pale light was spread about it and the heavy shadows gave way before it; and then as it drew near he thought that he heard, like an echo in

saw how closely he resembled his brother boromir - whom pippin had liked from the first, admiring the great man’s lordly but kindly manner. yet suddenly for faramir his heart was strangely moved with a feeling that he had not known before. here was one with an air of high nobility such as aragorn at times revealed, less high perhaps, yet also less incalculable and remote: one of the kings of men born into a later time, but touched with the wisdom and sadness of the elder race. he knew now why beregond spoke his name with love. he was a captain that men would follow, that he would follow, even under the shadow of the black wings.
‘faramir!’ he cried aloud with the others. ‘faramir!’ and faramir catching his strange voice among the clamour of the men of the city, turned and looked down at him and was amazed.
‘whence come you?’ he said. ‘a halfling, and in the livery of the tower! whence…?’
but with that gandalf stepped to his side and spoke. ‘he came with me from the land o

nd gazed eastward.
the bells of day had scarcely rung out again, a mockery in the unlightened dark, when far away he saw fires spring up, across in the dim spaces where the walls of the pelennor stood. the watchmen cried aloud, and all men in the city stood to arms. now ever and anon there was a red flash, and slowly through the heavy air dull rumbles could be heard.
‘they have taken the wall!’ men cried. ‘they are blasting breaches in it. they are coming!’
‘where is faramir?’ cried beregond in dismay. ‘say not that he has fallen!’
it was gandalf that brought the first tidings. with a handful of horsemen he came in the middle morning, riding as escort to a line of wains. they were filled with wounded men, all that could be saved from the wreck of the causeway forts. at once he went to denethor. the lord of the city sat now in a high chamber above the hall of the white tower with pippin at his side; and through the dim windows, north and south and east, he bent his dark eyes, as

‘who is the master of minas tirith?’ the man answered. ‘the lord denethor or the grey wanderer?’
‘the grey wanderer or no one, it would seem,’ said pippin, and he sped back and up the winding way as swiftly as his feet would carry him, past the astonished porter, out through the door, and on, till he came near the gate of the citadel. the sentinel hailed him as he went by, and he recognized the voice of beregond.
‘whither do you run, master peregrin?’ he cried.
‘to find mithrandir,’ pippin answered.
‘the lord’s errands are urgent and should not be hindered by me,’ said beregond; ‘but tell me quickly, if you may: what goes forward? whither has my lord gone? i have just come on duty, but i heard that he passed towards the closed door, and men were bearing faramir before him.’
‘yes,’ said pippin, ‘to the silent street.’
beregond bowed his head to hide his tears. ‘they said that

 he was dying,’ he sighed, ‘and now he is dead.’
‘no,’ said pippin, ‘not yet. and even now his death might be prevented, i think. but the lord of the city, beregond, has fallen before his city is taken. he is fey and dangerous.’ quickly he told of denethor’s strange words and deeds. ‘i must find gandalf at once.’
‘then you must go down to the battle.’
‘i know. the lord has given me leave. but, beregond, if you can, do something to stop any dreadful thing happening.’
‘the lord does not permit those who wear the black and silver to leave their post for any cause, save at his own command.’
‘well, you must choose between orders and the life of faramir,’ said pippin. ‘and as for orders, i think you have a madman to deal with, not a lord. i must run. i will return if i can.’
he ran on, down, down towards the outer city. men flying back from the burning passed him, and some seeing his

‘but faramir!’ cried pippin. ‘he is not dead, and they will burn him alive, if someone does not stop them.’
‘burn him alive?’ said gandalf. ‘what is this tale? be quick!’
‘denethor has gone to the tombs,’ said pippin, ‘and he has taken faramir, and he says we are all to burn, and he will not wait, and they are to make a pyre and burn him on it, and faramir as well. and he has sent men to fetch wood and oil. and i have told beregond, but i’m afraid he won’t dare to leave his post: he is on guard. and what can he do anyway?’ so pippin poured out his tale, reaching up and touching gandalf’s knee with trembling hands. ‘can’t you save faramir?’
‘maybe i can,’ said gandalf; ‘but if i do, then others will die, i fear. well, i must come, since no other help can reach him. but evil and sorrow will come of this. even in the heart of our stronghold the enemy has power to strike us: for his will it is that is at w

they passed on; and as they climbed and drew near to the citadel they felt the wind blowing in their faces, and they caught the glimmer of morning far away, a light growing in the southern sky. but it brought little hope to them, not knowing what evil lay before them, fearing to come too late.
‘darkness is passing,’ said gandalf, ‘but it still lies heavy on this city.’
at the gate of the citadel they found no guard. ‘then beregond has gone,’ said pippin more hopefully. they turned away and hastened along the road to the closed door. it stood wide open, and the porter lay before it. he was slain and his key had been taken.
‘work of the enemy!’ said gandalf. ‘such deeds he loves: friend at war with friend; loyalty divided in confusion of hearts.’ now he dismounted and bade shadowfax return to his stable. ‘for, my friend,’ he said, ‘you and i should have ridden to the fields long ago, but other matters delay

ow them cries and the ringing of swords: such sounds as had not been heard in the hallowed places since the building of the city. at last they came to rath dínen and hastened towards the house of the stewards, looming in the twilight under its great dome.
‘stay! stay!’ cried gandalf, springing forward to the stone stair before the door. ‘stay this madness!’
for there were the servants of denethor with swords and torches in their hands; but alone in the porch upon the topmost step stood beregond, clad in the black and silver of the guard; and he held the door against them. two of them had already fallen to his sword, staining the hallows with their blood; and the others cursed him, calling him outlaw and traitor to his master.
even as gandalf and pippin ran forward, they heard from within the house of the dead the voice of denethor crying: ‘haste, haste! do as i have bidden! slay me this renegade! or must i do so myself?’ thereupon the door which beregond held shut with his left ha

then gandalf seeing the madness that was on him feared that he had already done some evil deed, and he thrust forward, with beregond and pippin behind him, while denethor gave back until he stood beside the table within. but there they found faramir, still dreaming in his fever, lying upon the table. wood was piled under it, and high all about it, and all was drenched with oil, even the garments of faramir and the coverlets; but as yet no fire had been set to the fuel. then gandalf revealed the strength that lay hid in him; even as the light of his power was hidden under his grey mantle. he leaped up on to the faggots, and r

wizard’s pupil. but if doom denies this to me, then i will have naught: neither life diminished, nor love halved, nor honour abated.’
‘to me it would not seem that a steward who faithfully surrenders his charge is diminished in love or in honour,’ said gandalf. ‘and at the least you shall not rob your son of his choice while his death is still in doubt.’
at those words denethor’s eyes flamed again, and taking the stone under his arm he drew a knife and strode towards the bier. but beregond sprang forward and set himself before faramir.
‘so!’ cried denethor. ‘thou hadst already stolen half my son’s love. now thou stealest the hearts of my knights also, so that they rob me wholly of my son at the last. but in this at least thou shalt not defy my will: to rule my own end.’
‘come hither!’ he cried to his servants. ‘come, if you are not all recreant!’ then two of them ran up the steps to him. swiftly he snatched a torch from the hand of one and sprang back into the h

t stone, unless he had a great strength of will to turn it to other purpose, he saw only two aged hands withering in flame.
gandalf in grief and horror turned his face away and closed the door. for a while he stood in thought, silent upon the threshold, while those outside heard the greedy roaring of the fire within. and then denethor gave a great cry, and afterwards spoke no more, nor was ever again seen by mortal men.
‘so passes denethor, son of ecthelion,’ said gandalf: then he turned to beregond and the lord’s servants that stood there aghast. ‘and so pass also the days of gondor that you have known; for good or evil they are ended. ill deeds have been done here; but let now all enmity that lies between you be put away, for it was contrived by the enemy and works his will. you have been caught in a net of warring duties that you did not weave. but think, you servants of the lord, blind in your obedience, that but for the treason of beregond faramir, captain of the white tower, woul

‘bear away from this unhappy place your comrades who have fallen. and we will bear faramir, steward of gondor, to a place where he can sleep in peace, or die if that be his doom.’
then gandalf and beregond taking up the bier bore it away towards the houses of healing, while behind them walked pippin with downcast head. but the servants of the lord stood gazing as stricken men at the house of the dead; and even as gandalf came to the end of rath dínen there was a great noise. looking back they saw the dome of the house crack and smokes issue forth; and then with a rush and rumble of stone it fell in a flurry of fire; but still unabated the flames danced and flickered among the ruins. then in terr

or the servants fled and followed gandalf.
at length they came back to the steward’s door, and beregond looked with grief at the porter. ‘this deed i shall ever rue,’ he said; ‘but a madness of haste was on me, and he would not listen, but drew sword against me.’ then taking the key that he had wrested from the slain man he closed the door and locked it. ‘this should now be given to the lord faramir,’ he said.
‘the prince of dol amroth is in command in the absence of the lord,’ said gandalf; ‘but since he is not here, i must take this on myself. i bid you keep the key and guard

f the houses, they heard a great cry that went up from the field before the gate and rising shrill and piercing into the sky passed, and died away on the wind. so terrible was the cry that for a moment all stood still, and yet when it had passed, suddenly their hearts were lifted up in such a hope as they had not known since the darkness came out of the east; and it seemed to them that the light grew clear and the sun broke through the clouds.
but gandalf’s face was grave and sad, and bidding beregond and pippin to take faramir into the houses of healing, he went up on to the walls nearby; and there like a figure carven in white he stood in the new sun and looked out. and he beheld with the sight that was given to him all that had befallen; and when éomer rode out from the forefront of his battle and stood beside those who lay upon the field, he sighed, and he cast his cloak about him again, and went from the walls. and beregond and pippin found him standing in thought before the door of th

‘now i understand what seemed so strange to me!’ said pippin shuddering at his memories as he spoke. ‘the lord went away from the room where faramir lay; and it was only when he returned that i first thought he was changed, old and broken.’
‘it was in the very hour that faramir was brought to the tower that many of us saw a strange light in the topmost chamber,’ said beregond. ‘but we have seen that light before, and it has long been rumoured in the city, that the lord would at times wrestle in thought with his enemy.’
‘alas! then i have guessed rightly,’ said gandalf. ‘thus the will of sauron entered into minas tirith; and thus i have been delayed here. and here i shall still be forced to remain, for i shall soon have other charges, not faramir only.
‘now i must go down to meet those who come. i have seen a sight upon the field that is very grievous to

my heart, and greater sorrow may yet come to pass. come with me, pippin! but you, beregond, should return to the citadel and tell the chief of the guard there what has befallen. it will be his duty, i fear, to withdraw you from the guard; but say to him that, if i may give him counsel, you should be sent to the houses of healing, to be the guard and servant of your captain, and to be at his side when he awakes - if that shall ever be again. for by you he was saved from the fire. go now! i shall return soon.’
with that he turned away and went with pippin down towards the lower city.

ear and pity. ‘no, we are going to the houses of healing.’
they turned out of the lane that ran between tall houses and the outer wall of the fourth circle, and they regained the main street climbing up to the citadel. step by step they went, while merry swayed and murmured as one in sleep.
‘i’ll never get him there,’ thought pippin. ‘is there no one to help me? i can’t leave him here.’ just then to his surprise a boy came running up behind, and as he passed he recognized bergil beregond’s son.
‘hullo, bergil!’ he called. ‘where are you going? glad to see you again, and still alive!’
‘i am running errands for the healers,’ said bergil. ‘i cannot stay.’
‘don’t!’ said pippin. ‘but tell them up there that i have a sick hobbit, a perian mind you, come from the battle-field. i don’t think he can walk so far. if mithrandir is there, he will be glad of the message.’ bergil ran on.
‘i’d better wait here,’ thought pippin. so he let merry sink gently d

knowledge and love was kindled in his eyes, and he spoke softly. ‘my lord, you called me. i come. what does the king command?’
‘walk no more in the shadows, but awake!’ said aragorn. ‘you are weary. rest a while, and take food, and be ready when i return.’
‘i will, lord,’ said faramir. ‘for who would lie idle when the king has returned?’
‘farewell then for a while!’ said aragorn. ‘i must go to others who need me.’ and he left the chamber with gandalf and imrahil; but beregond and his son remained behind, unable to contain their joy. as he followed gandalf and shut the door pippin heard ioreth exclaim:
‘king! did you hear that? what did i say? the hands of a healer, i said.’ and soon the word had gone out from the house that the king was indeed come among them, and after war he brought healing; and the news ran through the city.
but aragorn came to éowyn, and he said: ‘here there is a grievous hurt and a heavy blow. the arm that was broken has been tended with

‘the lady éowyn,’ said aragorn, ‘will wish soon to rise and depart; but she should not be permitted to do so, if you can in any way restrain her, until at least ten days be passed.’
‘as for faramir,’ said gandalf, ‘he must soon learn that his father is dead. but the full tale of the madness of denethor should not be told to him, until he is quite healed and has duties to do. see that beregond and the perian who were present do not speak to him of these things yet!’
and the other perian meriadoc who is under my care, what of him?’ said the warden.
‘it is likely that he will be fit to arise tomorrow, for a short while,’ said aragorn. ‘let him do so, if he wishes. he may walk a little in the care of his friends.’
‘they are a remarkable race,’ said the warden, nodding his head. ‘very tough in the fibre, i deem.’

y; and little hope at all was left in his heart that he would ever see any of them again.
as if recalled by his mood of despair, the pain in his arm returned, and he felt weak and old, and the sunlight seemed thin. he was roused by the touch of bergil’s hand.
‘come, master perian!’ said the lad. ‘you are still in pain, i see. i will help you back to the healers. but do not fear! they will come back. the men of minas tirith will never be overcome. and now they have the lord elfstone, and beregond of the guard too.’
ere noon the army came to osgiliath. there all the workers and craftsmen that could be spared were busy. some were strengthening the ferries and boat-bridges that the enemy had made and in part destroyed when they fled; some gathered stores and booty; and others on the eastern side across the river were throwing up hasty works of defence.
the vanguard passed on through the ruins of old gondor, and over the wide river, and on up the long straight road that in the high days h

g towards the south was veiled in the reeks of mordor, and through a threatening haze it gleamed, remote, a sullen red, as if it were the ending of the day, or the end maybe of all the world of light. and out of the gathering mirk the nazgûl came with. their cold voices crying words of death; and then all hope was quenched.
pippin had bowed crushed with horror when he heard gandalf reject the terms and doom frodo to the torment of the tower; but he had mastered himself, and now he stood beside beregond in the front rank of gondor with imrahil’s men. for it seemed best to him to die soon and leave the bitter story of his life, since all was in ruin.
‘i wish merry was here,’ he heard himself saying, and quick thoughts raced through his mind, even as he watched the enemy come charging to the assault. ‘well, well, now at any rate i understand poor denethor a little better. we might die together, merry and i, and since die we must, why not? well, as he is not here, i hope he’ll find an e

lls out of gorgoroth. taller and broader than men they were, and they were clad only in close-fitting mesh of horny scales, or maybe that was their hideous hide; but they bore round bucklers huge and black and wielded heavy hammers in their knotted hands. reckless they sprang into the pools and waded across, bellowing as they came. like a storm they broke upon the line of the men of gondor, and beat upon helm and head, and arm and shield as smiths hewing the hot bending iron. at pippin’s side beregond was stunned and overborne, and he fell; and the great troll-chief that smote him down bent over him, reaching out a clutching claw; for these fell creatures would bite the throats of those that they threw down.
then pippin stabbed upwards, and the written blade of westernesse pierced through the hide and went deep into the vitals of the troll, and his black blood came gushing out. he toppled forward and came crashing down like a falling rock, burying those beneath him. blackness and stench and

m many lands and peoples, from the east and the south, and from the borders of mirkwood, and from dunland in the west. and the king pardoned the easterlings that had given themselves up, and sent them away free, and he made peace with the peoples of harad; and the slaves of mordor he released and gave to them all the lands about lake núrnen to be their own. and there were brought before him many to receive his praise and reward for their valour; and last the captain of the guard brought to him beregond to be judged.
and the king said to beregond: ‘beregond, by your sword blood was spilled in the hallows, where that is forbidden. also you left your post without leave of lord or of captain. for these things, of old, death was the penalty. now therefore i must pronounce your doom.
‘all penalty is remitted for your valour in battle, and still more because all that you did was for the love of the lord faramir. nonetheless you must leave the guard of the citadel, and you must go forth from the

city of minas tirith.’
then the blood left beregond’s face, and he was stricken to the heart and bowed his head. but the king said.:
‘so it must be, for you are appointed to the white company, the guard of faramir, prince of ithilien, and you shall be its captain and dwell in emyn arnen in honour and peace, and in the service of him for whom you risked all, to save him from death.’
and then beregond, perceiving the mercy and justice of the king, was glad, and kneeling kissed his hand, and departed in joy and content. and aragorn gave to faramir ithilien to be his princedom, and bade him dwell in the hills of emyn arnen within sight of the city.
‘for,’ said he, ‘minas ithil in morgul vale shall be utterly destroyed, and though it may in time to come be made clean, no man may dwell there for many long years.’
and last of all aragorn greeted éomer of rohan, and they embraced, and ara
