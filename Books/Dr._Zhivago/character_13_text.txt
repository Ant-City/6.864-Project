sband at the office. he crossed over to the darker side of the square, toward the workshops and the black shape of the turntable with tracks fanning out from it toward the depot.
   tiverzin! kuprik! several voices called out of the darkness. there was a little crowd outside the workshops. inside, someone was yelling and a boy was crying. do go in and help that boy, kuprian savelievich, said a woman in the crowd.
   as usual, the old foreman, piotr khudoleiev, was walloping his young apprentice yusupka.
   khudoleiev had not always been a tormentor of apprentices and a brawling drunkard. there had been a time when, as a dashing young workman, he had attracted the admiring glances of merchants and priests daughters in moscows industrial suburbs. but the girl he courted, marfa, who had graduated that year from the diocesan convent school, had turned him down and had married his comrade, the mechanic savelii nikitich, tiverzins father.
   five years after saveliis horrible end (he was burned to

death in the sensational railway crash of 1888) khudoleiev renewed his suit, but again marfa gavrilovna rejected him. so khudoleiev took to drink and rowdiness, trying to get even with a world which was to blame, so he believed, for all his misfortunes.
   yusupka was the son of gimazetdin, the janitor at the block of tenements where tiverzin lived. tiverzin had taken the boy under his wing, and this added fuel to khudoleievs hostility.
   is that the way to hold a file, you asiatic? bellowed khudoleiev, dragging yusupka by the hair and pummelling the back of his neck. is that the way to strip down a casting, you slit-eyed tartar?
   ouch, i wont do it any more, mister, ow, i wont do it any more, ouch, it hurts!

tiverzin went home two days later, unshaven, drawn with lack of sleep, and chilled to the bone. frost, unusual at this time of year, had set in the night before, and tiverzin was not dressed for winter. the janitor, gimazetdin, met him at the gate.
   thank you, mr. tiverzin, he babbled in broken russian. you didnt let yusupka come to harm. i will always pray for you.
   youre crazy, gimazetdin, whore you calling mister? cut it out and say what you have to say quickly, you see how cold it is.
   why should you be cold? you will soon be warm, kuprian savelich. me and your mother marfa gavrilovna brought a whole shedful of wood from the freight station yesterdayall birchgood, dry wood.
   thanks, gimazetdin. if theres something else you want to tell me lets have it quickly. im frozen.

on post. bent double, the observers hurried to a safer distance.
   galiullin had shared antipovs dugout. after antipovs comrades resigned themselves to the idea that he was dead, galiullin, who had known him well, was asked to take charge of his belongings and keep them for his widow, a large number of whose photographs had been found among his things.
   an enlisted man recently promoted to lieutenant, the mechanic galiullin, son of gimazetdin, the janitor of tiverzins tenement, was that very yusupka whom, as an apprentice in the distant past, the foreman khudoleiev had beaten up. it was to his old tormentor that he was now indebted for his promotion.
   on getting his commission, he had found himself, against his will and for no reason that he knew of, in a soft job in a small-town garrison behind the lines. there he commanded a troop of semi-invalids whom instructors as decrepit as themselves took every morning through the drill they had forgotten. galiullin supervised the changing of the

er him? on the other hand, what grounds could galiullin think of to apply for his own transfer? giving the boredom and uselessness of garrison duty as his reasons, he asked to be sent to the front. this earned him a good mark, and when, at the first engagement, he showed his other qualities it turned out that he had the makings of an excellent officer and he was quickly promoted to first lieutenant.
   galiullin had met antipov in 1905, when pasha antipov spent six months with the tiverzins and yusupka went to play with him on sundays. there too he had once or twice met lara. he had heard nothing of either of them since. when antipov came from yuriatin and joined the regiment, galiullin was struck by the change in his old friend. the shy, mischievous, and girlish child had turned into an arrogant, know-it-all misanthrope. he was intelligent, very brave, taciturn, and sarcastic. sometimes, looking at him, galiullin could have sworn that he saw in his gloomy eyes, as inside a window, something

g as the changing weather, as the restless night.
   it occurred to lara that after all the devotion galiullin had shown to pashas memory, the pains he had taken to look after his things, she had not so much as asked him who he was and where he came from.
   to make up for her omission and not seem ungrateful she asked him all about himself when she made her next morning round.
   merciful heaven, she wondered aloud. twenty-eight brest street, the tiverzins, the revolution of 1905, that winter! yusupka? no, she couldnt remember having met him, he must forgive her. but that year, that year, and that house! thats true, there had really been such a house and such a year! how vividly it all came back to her! the gunfire andwhat was it she had called it then?christs judgment! how strong, how piercingly sharp were the feelings you experienced for the first time as a child! forgive me, do forgive me, lieutenant, what did you say your name is? yes, yes, you did tell me once. thank you, osip gimazetdi

the cab. dont worry, comrade doctor, well get her there all right.
   thats wonderful. actually, i only meant where could i write out the order. but if theres a cab as well ... may i ask you, are you the mother of lieutenant galiullin? we were in the same unit at the front.
   galiullina started violently and grew pale. she grasped the doctors hand. come outside, she said. well talk in the yard.
   as soon as they were outside the door she said quickly: talk softly, for gods sake. dont ruin me. yusupkas gone wrong. judge for yourselfwhat is he? he was an apprentice, a worker. he ought to understandsimple people are much better off now, a blind man can see that, nobody can deny it. i dont know what you feel yourself, maybe it would be all right for you, but its a sin for yusupka, god wont forgive him. yusupkas father was a private, he was killed, they say his face was shot off, and his arms and legs.
   her voice broke, she waited till she was more calm, then she went on: come. ill get you the

night had fallen. all around them was darkness, only the small round patch of light from deminas pocket flashlight jumped from snowdrift to snowdrift four or five paces ahead, confusing more than lighting the way. the darkness was all around them, and they ha
