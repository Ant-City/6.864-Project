ully  loaded.  he  carried  a  strobe  light  and  the
responsibility for the lives of his men.

as  an  rto,  mitchell  sanders  carried  the  prc-25  radio,  a  killer,  26

pounds with its battery.

as a medic, rat kiley carried a canvas satchel filled with morphine and
plasma and malaria tablets and surgical tape and comic books and all the
things a medic must carry, including m&m's for especially bad wounds,
for a total weight of nearly 20 pounds.

as a big man, therefore a machine gunner, henry dobbins carried the
m-60, which weighed 23 pounds unloaded, but which was almost always
loaded.  in  addition,  dobbins  carried  between  10  and  15  pounds  of
ammunition draped in belts across his chest and shoulders.

as  pfcs  or  spec  4s,  most  of  them  were  common  grunts  and  carried
the  standard  m-16  gas-operated  assault  rifle.  the  weapon  weighed  7.5
pounds  unloaded,  8.2  pounds  with
its  full  20-round  magazine.

 an  irrigation  ditch,  badly
burned,  flies  in  his  mouth  and  eyes.  the  boy  wore  black  shorts  and
sandals. at the time of his death he had been carrying a pouch of rice, a
rifle, and three magazines of ammunition.

you want my opinion, mitchell sanders said, there's a definite moral

here.

he put his hand on the dead boy's wrist. he was quiet for a time, as if
counting a pulse, then he patted the stomach, almost affectionately, and
used kiowa's hunting hatchet to remove the thumb.

henry dobbins asked what the moral was.
moral?
you know. moral.
sanders  wrapped  the  thumb  in  toilet  paper  and  handed  it  across  to
norman bowker. there was no blood. smiling, he kicked the boy's head,
watched  the  flies  scatter,  and  said,  it's  like  with  that  old  tv  show—
paladin. have gun, will travel.

henry dobbins thought about it.
yeah, well, he finally said. i don't see no moral.
there it is, man.
fuck off.

death itself. they kicked corpses. they cut off thumbs. they talked grunt
lingo.  they  told  stories  about  ted  lavender's  supply  of  tranquilizers,
how the poor guy didn't feel a thing, how incredibly tranquil he was.

there's a moral here, said mitchell sanders.
they  were  waiting  for  lavender's  chopper,  smoking  the  dead  man's

dope.

the moral's pretty obvious, sanders said, and winked. stay away from

drugs. no joke, they'll ruin your day every time.

cute, said henry dobbins.
mind  blower,  get  it?  talk  about  wiggy.  nothing  left,  just  blood  and

brains.

they made themselves laugh.
there  it  is,  they'd  say.  over  and  over—there  it  is,  my  friend,  there  it
is—as if the repetition itself were an act of poise, a balance between crazy
and  almost  crazy,  knowing  without  going,  there  it  is,  which  meant  be

lavender, and after a while jimmy rubbed his eyes and said he'd never
forgiven himself for lavender's death. it was something that would never
go away, he said quietly, and i nodded and told him i felt the same about
certain things. then for a long time neither of us could think of much to
say. the thing to do, we decided, was to forget the coffee and switch to
gin,  which  improved  the  mood,  and  not  much  later  we  were  laughing
about some of the craziness that used to go on. the way henry dobbins
carried  his  girlfriend's  pantyhose  around  his  neck  like  a  comforter.
kiowa's  moccasins  and  hunting  hatchet.  rat  kiley's  comic  books.  by
midnight we were both a little high, and i decided there was no harm in
asking  about  martha.  i'm  not  sure  how  i  phrased  it—just  a  general
question—but jimmy cross looked up in surprise. "you writer types," he
said,  "you've  got  long  memories."  then  he  smiled  and  excused  himself
and  went  up  to  the  guest  room  and

placing it near the altar area, bowing and gesturing for him to sit down.
the old monk seemed proud of the chair, and proud that such a man as
lieutenant cross should be sitting in it. on another occasion the younger
monk  presented  us  with  four  ripe  watermelons  from  his  garden.  he
stood watching until the watermelons were eaten down to the rinds, then
he smiled and made the strange washing motion with his hands.

though they were kind to all of us, the monks took a special liking for

henry dobbins.

"soldier jesus," they'd say, "good soldier jesus."



squatting  quietly  in  the  cool  pagoda,  they  would  help  dobbins
disassemble and clean his machine gun, carefully brushing the parts with
oil.  the  three  of  them  seemed  to  have  an  understanding.  nothing  in
words, just a quietness they shared.

"you  know,"  dobbins  said  to  kiowa  one  morning,  "after  the  war

maybe i'll join up with these guys."

"join how?" kiowa said.
"wear robes. take the pledge."
kiowa thought ab

"but  anyway,"  dobbins  said,  "i  couldn't  ever  be  a  real  minister,
because  you  have  to  be  super  sharp.  upstairs,  i  mean.  it  takes  brains.
you  have  to  explain  some  hard  stuff,  like  why  people  die,  or  why  god
invented pneumonia and all that." he shook his head. "i just didn't have
the  smarts  for  it.  and  there's  the  religious  thing,  too.  all  these  years,
man, i still hate church."

"maybe you'd change," kiowa said.
henry dobbins closed his eyes briefly, then laughed.



"one thing for sure, i'd look spiffy in those robes they wear—just like
friar tuck. maybe i'll do it. find a monastery somewhere. wear a robe
and be nice to people."

"sounds good," kiowa said.
the two monks were quiet as they cleaned and oiled the machine gun.
though they spoke almost no english, they seemed to have great respect
for  the  conversation,  as  if  sensing  that  important  matters  were  being
discussed. the younger monk used a yellow

 throat. "this is all wrong," he said.
"what?"
"setting up here. it's wrong. i don't care what, it's still a church."
dobbins nodded. "true."
"a church," kiowa said. "just wrong."
when  the  two  monks  finished  cleaning  the  machine  gun,  henry
dobbins began reassembling it, wiping off the excess oil, then he handed
each of them a can of peaches and a chocolate bar. "okay," he said, "didi



mau, boys. beat it." the monks bowed and moved out of the pagoda into
the bright morning sunlight.

henry dobbins made the washing motion with his hands.
"you're right," he said. "all you can do is be nice. treat them decent,

you know?"

the man i killed


his jaw was in his throat, his upper lip and teeth were gone, his one
eye  was  shut,  his  other  eye  was  a  star-shaped  hole,  his  eyebrows  were
thin  and  arched  like  a  woman's,  his  nose  was  undamaged,  there  was  a
slight tear at the lobe of one ear, his clean black hair was swept upward
into a cowlick at the rear of the skull, his fore

mocked  the  girl's  dancing.  he  did  funny  jumps  and  spins.  he  put  the
palms of his hands against his ears and danced sideways for a while, and
then  backwards,  and  then  did  an  erotic  thing  with  his  hips.  but  henry
dobbins,  who  moved  gracefully  for  such  a  big  man,  took  azar  from
behind and lifted him up high and carried him over to a deep well and
asked if he wanted to be dumped in.

azar said no.
"all right, then," henry dobbins said, "dance right."

boot, and they waited a moment, then sanders sighed and said, "okay,"
and they took hold of the two boots and pulled up hard. there was only a
slight give. they tried again, but this time the body did not move at all.
after the third try they stopped and looked down for a while. "one more
time," norman bowker said. he counted to three and they leaned back
and pulled.

"stuck," said mitchell sanders.
"i see that. christ."
they tried again, then called over henry dobbins and rat kiley, and
all  five  of  them  put  their  arms  and  backs  into  it,  but  the  body  was
jammed in tight.

azar moved to the dike and sat holding his stomach. his face was pale.
the  others  stood  in  a  circle,  watching  the  water,  then  after  a  time
somebody said, "we can't just leave him there," and the men nodded and
got  out  their  entrenching  tools  and  began  digging.  it  was  hard,  sloppy

had plunged headfirst off a high tower. the men stood quietly for a few
seconds. there was a feeling of awe. mitchell sanders finally nodded and
said,  "let's  get  it  done,"  and  they  took  hold  of  the  legs  and  pulled  up
hard, then pulled again, and after a moment kiowa came sliding to the
surface. a piece of his shoulder was missing; the arms and chest and face
were  cut  up  with  shrapnel.  he  was  covered  with  bluish  green  mud.
"well," henry dobbins said, "it could be worse," and dave jensen said,
"how, man? tell me how." carefully, trying not to look at the body, they
carried kiowa over to the dike and laid him down. they used towels to
clean off the scum. rat kiley went through the kid's pockets, placed his
personal effects in a plastic bag, taped the bag to kiowa's wrist, then used
the radio to call in a dustoff.

moving  away,  the  men  found  things  to  do  with  themselves,  some

"bobby jorgenson," i said. "where is he?"
"be cool."
"where's my good buddy bobby?"
norman  bowker  made  a  short  clicking  sound  with  his  tongue.  "you

want to hear this? yes or no?"

"sure i do."
"so listen up, then. morty gets sick. like you never seen nobody so bad
off.  this  is  real  kickass  disease,  he  can't  walk  or  talk,  can't  fart.  can't

henry dobbins shook his head. "not polio. you got it wrong."
"maybe polio."
"no way," said dobbins. "not polio."
"well, hey," bowker said, "i'm just saying what jorgenson says. maybe
fuckin'  polio.  or  that  weird  elephant  disease.  elephantiasshole  or
whatever."

"yeah, but not polio."
across the hootch, sitting off by himself, azar grinned and snapped his
fingers.  "either  way,"  he  said,  "it  goes  to  show  you.  don't  throw  away

"morty was due," dave jensen said.
"overdue," sanders said.
norman bowker nodded solemnly. "you don't mess around like that.

you just don't fritter away all your luck."

"amen," said sanders.
"fuckin' polio," said henry dobbins.
we sat quietly for a time. there was no need to talk, because we were
thinking the same things: about morty phillips and the way luck worked
and didn't work and how it was impossible to calculate the odds. there
were  a  million  ways  to  die.  getting  shot  was  one  way.  booby  traps  and
land mines and gangrene and shock and polio from a vc virus.

 kill was an old man who lay face-up near a pigpen at the
center  of  the  village.  his  right  arm  was  gone.  at  his  face  there  were
already many flies and gnats.

dave  jensen  went  over  and  shook  the  old  man's  hand.  "how-dee-

doo," he said.

one by one the others did it too. they didn't disturb the body, they just

grabbed the old man's hand and offered a few words and moved away.

rat kiley bent over the corpse. "gimme five," he said. "a real honor."
"pleased as punch," said henry dobbins.
i  was  brand-new  to  the  war.  it  was  my  fourth  day;  i  hadn't  yet
developed a sense of humor. right away, as if i'd swallowed something, i

closed my eyes, put my head between my knees.

after a moment dave jensen touched my shoulder.
"be polite now," he said. "go introduce yourself. nothing to be afraid

about, just a nice old man. show a little respect for your elders."
