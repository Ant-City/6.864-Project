"did you hear from cohn?"
"rather. he's keen about it."
"my god!"
"i thought it was rather odd myself."
"says he can't wait to see me."
"does he think you're coming alone?"
"no. i told him we were all coming down together. michael and all."
"he's wonderful."
"isn't he?"




they expected their money the next day. we arranged to meet at pamplona. they would go directly to san

sebastian and take the train from there. we would all meet at the montoya in pamplona. if they did not turn up on
monday at the latest we would go on ahead up to burguete in the mountains, to start fishing. there was a bus to
burguete. i wrote out an itinerary so they could follow us.

bill and i took the morning train from the gare d'orsay. it was a lovely day, not too hot, and the country was
beautiful from the start. we went back into the diner and had breakfast. leaving the dining-car i asked the conductor
for tickets for the first service.

white across the plain going toward pamplona.
we  came  into  the  town  on  the  other  side  of  the  plateau,  the  road  slanting  up  steeply  and  dustily  with

shade-trees on both sides, and then levelling out through the new part of town they are building up outside the old
walls. we passed the bull-ring, high and white and concrete-looking in the sun, and then came into the big square by
a side street and stopped in front of the hotel montoya.

the driver helped us down with the bags. there was a crowd of kids watching the car, and the square was hot,
and the trees were green, and the flags hung on their staffs, and it was good to get out of the sun and under the shade
of the arcade that runs all the way around the square. montoya was glad to see us, and shook hands and gave us
good rooms looking out on the square, and then we washed and cleaned up and went down-stairs in the dining-room
for lunch. the driver stayed for lunch, too,

there are two dining-rooms in the montoya. one is up-stairs on the second floor and looks out on the square.
the other is down one floor below the level of the square and has a door that opens on the back street that the bulls
pass along when they run through the streets early in the morning on their way to the ring. it is always cool in the

"you could," bill said, "but you don't need to."

"it would be like betting on the war," i said. "you don't need any economic interest."

"i'm very curious to see them," robert said.

montoya came up to our table. he had a telegram in his hand. "it's for you." he handed it to me.

it read: "stopped night san sebastian."

"it's from them," i said. i put it in my pocket. ordinarily i should have handed it over.

"they've stopped over in san sebastian," i said. "send their regards to you."

walked back toward the inn.
"say, wasn't that harris nice?" bill said.

"i think he really did have a good time."

"harris? you bet he did."

"i wish he'd come into pamplona."

"he wanted to fish."

"yes. you couldn't tell how english would mix with each other, anyway."

"i suppose not."


we got into pamplona late in the afternoon and the bus stopped in front of the hotel montoya. out in the plaza
they were stringing electric-light wires to light the plaza for the fiesta. a few kids came up when the bus stopped,
and  a  customs  officer  for  the  town  made  all  the  people  getting  down  from  the  bus  open  their  bundles  on  the
sidewalk.  we  went  into  the  hotel  and  on  the  stairs  i  met  montoya.  he  shook  hands  with  us,  smiling  in  his
embarrassed way.












come the miuras. do you all go down?"
"oh, yes. they've never seen a desencajonada.

montoya put his hand on my shoulder.

"i'll see you there."


he smiled again. he always smiled as though bull-fighting were a very special secret between the two of us; a
rather shocking but really very deep secret that we knew about. he always smiled as though there were something
lewd about the secret to outsiders, but that it was something that we understood. it would not do to expose it to
people who would not understand.


"your friends are here," he said.
"mr. campbell?"
"yes. mr. cohn and mr. c

ampbell and lady ashley."
he smiled as though there were something i would hear about.
"when did they get in?"
"yesterday. i've saved you the rooms you had."
"that's fine. did you give mr. campbell the room on the plaza?"
"yes. all the rooms we looked at."
"where are our friends now?"
"i think they went to the pelota."
"and how about the bulls?"
montoya smiled. "to-night," he said. "to-night at seven o'clock they bring in the villar bulls, and to-morrow

"your friend, is he aficionado, too?" montoya smiled at bill.





"yes. he came all the way from new york to see the san fermines."

"yes?" montoya politely disbelieved. "but he's not aficionado like you."

he put his hand on my shoulder again embarrassedly.

"yes," i said. "he's a real aficionado."

"but he's not aficionado like you are."


aficion means passion. an aficionado is one who is passionate about the bull-fights. all the good bull-fighters
stayed at montoya's hotel; that is, those with aficion stayed there. the commercial bul

lfighters stayed once, perhaps,
and  then  did  not  come  back.  the  good  ones  came  each  year.  in  montoya's  room  were  their  photographs.  the
photographs were dedicated to juanito montoya or to his sister. the photographs of bull-fighters montoya had really
believed in were framed. photographs of bull-fighters who had been without aficion montoya kept in a drawer of
his desk. they often had the most flattering inscriptions. but they did not mean anything. one day montoya took
them all out and dropped them in the waste-basket. he did not want them around.

we often talked about bulls and bull-fighters. i had stopped at the montoya for several years. we never talked
for  very long  at  a  time. it  was simply  the  pleasure  of discovering  what  we  each  felt.  men  would  come in  from
distant towns and before they left pamplona stop and talk for a few minutes with montoya about bulls. these men
were  aficionados.  those  who  were  aficionados  could  always

introduced me to some of them. they were always very polite at first, and it amused them very much that i should
be an american. somehow it was taken for granted that an american could not have aficion. he might simulate it or
confuse it with excitement, but he could not really have it. when they saw that i had aficion, and there was no
password, no set questions that could bring it out, rather it was a sort of oral spiritual examination with the questions

 and  never  apparent,  there  was  this  same  embarrassed  putting  the  hand  on  the
shoulder, or a "buen hombre." but nearly always there was the actual touching. it seemed as though they wanted to
touch you to make it certain.

montoya could forgive anything of a bull-fighter who had aficion. he could forgive attacks of nerves, panic,
bad  unexplainable  actions,  all  sorts  of  lapses.  for  one  who  had  aficion  he  could  forgive  anything.  at  once  he
forgave me all my friends. without his ever saying anything they were simply a little something shameful between
us, like the spilling open of the horses in bull-fighting.

they went up-stairs and i stopped to speak with montoya.
"well, how did you like the bulls?" he asked.

"good. they were nice bulls."

"they're all right"--montoya shook his head--"but they're not too good."


"what didn't you like about them?"
"i don't know. they just didn't give me the feeling that they were so good."






"i know what you mean."
"they're all right."
"yes. they're all right."

"he spends a lot of time there."

"i want him to stay there."

in the hotel on the stairs we met montoya.

"come on," said montoya. "do you want to meet pedro romero?"

"fine," said bill. "let's go see him."

we followed montoya up a flight and down the corridor.

"he's in room number eight," montoya explained. "he's getting dressed for the bull-fight."

montoya knocked on the door and opened it. it was a gloomy room with a little light coming in from the

window on the narrow street. there were two beds separated by a monastic partition. the electric light was on. the
boy stood very straight and

and dignified when we shook hands. montoya said something about what great aficionados we were, and that we
wanted to wish him luck. romero listened very seriously. then he turned to me. he was the best-looking boy i have
ever seen.

we thanked him. what was there that you would like to ask? the boy was nineteen years old, alone except for
his sword-handlet and the three hangers-on, and the bull-fight was to commence in twenty minutes. we wished him

ha suerte," shook hands, and went out. he was standing, straight and handsome and altogether by himself,
alone in the room with the hangers-on as we shut the door.
"he's a fine boy, don't you think so?" montoya asked.

"he's a good-looking kid," i said.


"he looks like a torero," montoya said. "he has the type."
"he's a fine boy."

"we'll see how he is in the ring," montoya said.


we found the big leather wine-bottle leaning against the wall in my room, took it and the field-glasses, locked
the door, and went down-stairs.

it was a good bull-fight. bill and i were very excited about pedro romero. montoya was sitting about ten
places away. after romero had killed his first bull montoya caught my eye and nodded his head. this was a real
one. there had not been a real one for a long time. of the other two matadors, one was very fair and the other was

"no bulls to-day."
"no," i said, "nothing but rain."
"where are your friends?"
"over at the iruña."
montoya smiled his embarrassed smile.
"look," he said. "do you know the american ambassador?"
"yes," i said. "everybody knows the american ambassador."
"he's here in town, now."
"yes," i said. "everybody's seen them."

"won't you have a drink?" i asked.

"no," said montoya, "i have to go." he went out.


i went down-stairs and out the door and took a walk around through the arcades around the square. it was still
raining. i looked in at the irufla for the gang and they were not there, so i walked on around the square and back to
the hotel. they were eating dinner in the down-stairs dining-room.

during  this  romero  was  fingering  his  glass  and  talking  with  brett.  brett  was  talking  french  and  he  was

bill was filling the glasses.

"tell him brett wants to come into--"

"oh, pipe down, mike, for christ's sake!"

romero looked up smiling. "pipe down! i know that," he said.


just then montoya came into the room. he started to smile at me, then he saw pedro romero with a big glass
of cognac in his hand, sitting laughing between me and a woman with bare shoulders, at a table full of drunks. he
did not even nod.

montoya went out of the room. mike was on his feet proposing a toast. "let's all drink to--" he began. "pedro

"you're nice," edna said to mike. "are you really a bankrupt?"

"tons."
"i owe everybody money," mike said. "i borrowed a hundred pesetas from montoya to-night."
"the hell you did," i said.
"i'll pay it back," mike said. "i always pay everything back."
"that's why you're a bankrupt, isn't it?" edna said.
i stood up. i had heard them talking from a long way away. it all seemed like some bad play.
"i'm going over to the hotel," i said. then i heard them talking about me.
"is he all right?" edna asked.
"we'd better walk with him."

"no. i can stay away another week. i think i'll go to san sebastian."

"i want to get back."

"what's mike going to do?"

"he's going to saint jean de luz."

"let's get a car and all go as far as bayonne. you can get the train up from there to-night."

"good. let's go after lunch."

"all right. i'll get the car."


we had lunch and paid the bill. montoya did not come near us. one of the maids brought the bill. the car was
outside. the chauffeur piled and strapped the bags on top of the car and put them in beside him in the front seat and
we got in. the car went out of the square, along through the side streets, out under the trees and down the hill and
away from pamplona. it did not seem like a very long ride. mike had a bottle of fundador. i only took a couple of

f the bed, put out my shaving things,
hung  up  some  clothes  in  the  big  armoire,  and  made  up  a  bundle  for  the  laundry.  then  i  took  a  shower  in  the
bathroom and went down to lunch. spain had not changed to summer-time, so i was early. i set my watch again. i
had recovered an hour by coming to san sebastian.

as i went into the dining-room the concierge brought me a police bulletin to fill out. i signed it and asked him
for two telegraph forms, and wrote a message to the hotel montoya, telling them to forward all mail and telegrams
for me to this address. i calculated how many days i would be in san sebastian and then wrote out a wire to the
office asking them to hold mail, but forward all wires for me to san sebastian for six days. then i went in and had
lunch.
after lunch i went up to my room, read a while, and went to sleep. when i woke it was half past four. i found

my swimming-suit, wrapped it with a comb in a towel, and went down-stairs and walked up the street to the
