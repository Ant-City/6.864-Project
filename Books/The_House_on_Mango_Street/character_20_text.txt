she has many troubles, but the big one is her husband who 
left and  keeps leaving. 

one day she is  through and lets him  know enough is 
enough. out the door he goes. clothes, records, shoes. out 
the window and the door locked. but that night he comes 
back and sends a  big  rock through  the window.  then  he 
is  sorry and she opens the door again. same story. 

next  week  she  comes  over  black  and  blue  and  asks 
what can she do?  minerva.  i don't know  which  way  she'll

nenny says she won't wait her whole life for a husband 
to come and get her, that minerva's sister left her mother's 
house  by  having  a  baby,  but she  doesn't  want  to  go  that
