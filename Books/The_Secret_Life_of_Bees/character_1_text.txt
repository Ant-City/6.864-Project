nd  clear  as  the  woman  in  navy  speaking  to  her 
daughter. 

"here's your coca-colas," the bow-tied man was 

saying.

i pointed to the honey jars. "where did you get 

those?" 

he  thought  the  tone  of  shock  in  my  voice  was  

really consternation. 

"i know what you mean. a lot of folks won't buy 
it  "cause  it's  got  the  virgin  mary  pictured  as  a  colored 
woman, but see, that's because the woman who makes 
the honey is colored herself." 

"what's her name?" 
"august boatwright," he said. "she keeps bees all 

over the county." 

keep  breathing,  keep  breathing.  "do  you  know 

where she lives?" 

"oh, sure, it's the darndest house you ever saw. 
painted  like  pepto-bismol.  your  grandmother  surely's 
seen itâ€”you go through town on main street till it turns 
into the highway to florence." 

i walked to the door. "thanks." 
"you tell your grandma hello for me," he said. 
rosaleen's  snores  were  making  the  bench  slats 
tremble. i gave her a shake. "wake up

of  my  eye  i  
caught  a  slight  movement  at  the  window,  a  venetian 
blind  slit  open,  then  closed.  when  the  door  opened,  it 
was  not the  woman in white  but another one wearing 
red,  her  hair  cut  so  short  it  resembled  a  little  gray, 
curlicue swim cap  pulled tight  over her scalp.  her face 
stared at us, suspicious and stern. i noticed she carried a 
musical bow tucked under her arm like a riding whip. it 
crossed my mind she might use it on us. 

"yes?" 
"are you august boatwright?" 
"no,  i'm  june  boatwright,"  she  said,  her  eyes 
sweeping  over  the  stitches  on  rosaleen's  forehead. 
"august boatwright is my sister. you came to see her?"

i  nodded,  and  simultaneously  another  woman 
appeared,  with  bare  feet.  she  wore  a  green-and-white 
sleeveless  gingham  dress  and  short  braids  that  stuck 
straight out all over her head. 

"i'm  may  boatwright,"  she  said.  "i'm  august's 
sister, too." she smiled at us, one of those odd grins that

directions. i wanted to bend down and kiss her, for how 
small and determined she looked. 

when  i  glanced  back  at  august,  she  was  still  

staring at me, like she expected me to say something. 

"well,  i guess  i'll  go  see  rosaleen's  new  bed," i 

said. 

august  picked  up  her  book,  and  that  was  that. 
the  moment  passed,  and  so  did  the  feeling  that  she 
knew who i was. i mean, it didn't make sense: how could 
august boatwright know anything about me? 

it was around this time that june and neil started 
a  first-class  fight  out  there  in  the  tomato  garden.  june 
shouted something, and he shouted back. 

"uh-oh,"  said  august.  she  put  down  the  book 

and stood up. 

"why can't you just let it be?" yelled june. 
"why does it always come back to this? get this 
i'm  not  getting  married.  not 

through  your  head: 
yesterday, not today, not next year!" 

"what are you scared of?" neil said. 
"for  your

he  drew  up  even  taller.  "well,  what  i  don't 
understand  is,  if  you're  going  to  live  with  your  aunt  in 
virginia, what are you doing here?"

here is the translation: i am completely confused 
what  a  white  girl  like  you  is  doing  staying  in  a  colored  
house. 

i took a breath. "well, see, my aunt bernie had to 
have  an  operation.  it  was  female  trouble.  so  rosaleen 
over  there  said,  "why  don't  me  and  you  stay  with  my  
friend august boatwright in tiburon till aunt bernie gets 
on her feet again?"' it was no sense in us going up there 
while she was in the hospital." 

he  was  actually  writing  this  down.  why?  i 
wanted to yell at him, this is not about me and rosaleen 
and  aunt  bernie's  operation.  this  is  about  may.  she  is 
dead,  or  haven't  you  noticed?  i  should've  been  in  my 
room right then crying my eyeballs out, and here i was 
having the stupidest conversation of my life. 

"didn't  you  have  any  white
