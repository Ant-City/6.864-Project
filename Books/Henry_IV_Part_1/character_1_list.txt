[CHARACTER] - 
                 king
henry iv's son, who will eventually become king henry v. harry's
title is prince of wales, but all of his friends call him hal; he
is also sometimes called harry monmouth. though harry spends all
his time hanging around highwaymen, robbers, and whores, he has
secret plans to transform himself into a noble prince, and his regal
qualities emerge as the play unfolds. harry is the closest thing
the play has to a protagonist: his complex and impressive mind is generally
at the center of the play, though shakespeare is often somewhat
ambiguous about how we are meant to understand this simultaneously
deceitful and heroic young prince.
