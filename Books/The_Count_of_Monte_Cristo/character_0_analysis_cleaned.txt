[CHARACTER]
before his imprisonment, [CHARACTER] is a kind, innocent,
honest, and loving man. though naturally intelligent, he is a man
of few opinions, living his life instinctively by a traditional
code of ethics that impels him to honor his superiors, care dutifully
for his aging father, and treat his fellow man generously. dantes
is filled with positive feeling, admiring his boss, monsieur morrel;
loving his father; adoring his fiancee, mercedes; and even attempting
to think kindly of men who clearly dislike him.

while in prison, however, dantes undergoes a great change.
he becomes bitter and vengeful as he obsesses over the wrongs committed
against him. when his companion, abbe faria, dies, so too does dantes's
only remaining deep connection to another human being. dantes loses
the capacity to feel any emotion other than hatred for those who
have harmed him and gratitude toward those who have tried to help
him. he moves through the world like an outsider, disconnected from
any human community and interested only in carrying out his mission
as the agent of providence. it is not until dantes finds love again,
in a relationship with haydee, that he is able to reconnect to his
own humanity and begin to live humanly again.
