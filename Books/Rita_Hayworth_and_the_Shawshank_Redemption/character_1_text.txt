in the optical company he owned and "work my way up." i found out that what he
really had in mind was keeping me in his house and under his thumb, like a
disagreeable pet that has not quite been housebroken and which may bite. enough
hate eventually piled up to cause me to do what i did. given a second chance, i
would not do it again, but i'm not sure that means i am rehabilitated.
anyway, it's not me i want to tell you about; i want to tell you about a guy
named andy dufresne. but before i can tell you about andy, i have to explain a
few other things about myself. it won't take long.
as i said, i've been the guy who can get it for you here at shawshank for damn
near forty years. and that doesn't just mean contraband items like extra

cigarettes or booze, although those items always top the list. but i've gotten
thousands of other items for men doing time here, some of them perfectly legal
yet hard to come by in a place where you've supposedly been brought to be

money to me? i'm never going to own a cadillac car or fly off to jamaica for two

yeah, i'm a regular neiman-marcus. and so when andy dufresne came to me in 1949
and asked if i could smuggle rita hayworth into the prison for him, i said it
would be no problem at all. and it wasn't.

when andy came to shawshank in 1948, he was thirty years old. he was a short,
neat little man with sandy hair and small, clever hands. he wore gold-rimmed
spectacles. his fingernails were always clipped, and they were always clean.
that's a funny thing to remember about a man, i suppose, but it seems to sum
andy up for me. he always looked as if he s

in all my years at shawshank, there have been less than ten men whom i believed
when they told me they were innocent. andy dufresne was one of them, although i
only became convinced of his innocence over a period of years. if i had been on
the jury that heard his case in portland superior court over six stormy weeks in
1947-48, i would have voted to convict, too.
it was one hell of a case, all right; one of those juicy ones with all the right
elements. there was a beautiful girl with society connections (dead), a local
sports figure (also dead), and a prominent young businessman in the dock. there

tracks (exactly matching the tread-and-wear pattern of the tires on the
defendant's 1947 plymouth).
in the living room of quentin's bungalow, four dishtowels had been found lying
on the sofa. there were bullet-holes through them and powder-burns on them. the
detective theorized (over the agonized objections of andy's lawyer) that the
murderer had wrapped the towels around the muzzle of the murder-weapon to muffle
the sound of the gunshots.

andy dufresne took the stand in his own defense and told his story calmly,
coolly, and dispassionately. he said he had begun to hear distressing rumors
about his wife and glenn quentin as early as the last week in july. in late
august he had become distressed enough to investigate a bit. on an evening when
linda was supposed to have gone shopping in portland after her golf lesson, andy
had followed her and quentin to quentin's two-story rented house (inevitably
dubbed "the love-nest" by the papers). he had p

ght, that he'd been more or less drunk since august
24th, and that he was a man who didn't handle his liquor very well. of course
that by itself would have been hard for any jury to swallow. they just couldn't
see this coldly self-possessed young man in the neat double-breasted three-piece
woolen suit ever getting falling-down drunk over his wife's sleazy little affair
with some small-town golf pro. i believed it because i had a chance to watch
andy that those six men and six women didn't have.
andy dufresne took just four drinks a year all the time i knew him. he would
meet me in the exercise yard every year about a week before his birthday and
then again about two weeks before christmas. on each occasion he would arrange
for a bottle of jack daniel's. he bought it the way most cons arrange to buy
their stuff-the slave's wages they pay in here, plus a little of his own. up
until 1965 what you got for your time was a dime an hour. in '65 they raised it
all the way up to a quarter. my commission on

and when you add on that surcharge to the price of a fine sippin' whiskey like
the black jack, you get an idea of how many hours of andy dufresne's sweat in
the prison laundry was going to buy his four drinks a year.
on the morning of his birthday, september 20th, he would have himself a big
knock, and then he'd have another that night after lights-out. the following day
he'd give the rest of the bottle back to me, and i would share it around. as for
the other bottle, he dealt himself one drink christmas night and another on new
year's eve. then that bottle would also come to me with instructions to pass it

long in my story.
there was a trusty, name of kendricks, who was into me for some pretty heavy
money back in the fifties, and it was four years before he got it all paid off.
most of the interest he paid me was information-in my line of work, you're dead
if you can't find ways of keeping your ear to the ground. this kendricks, for
instance, had access to records i was never going to see running a stamper down
in the goddam plate-shop.
kendricks told me that the parole board vote was 7-0 against andy dufresne
through 1957, 6-1 in '58, 7-0 again in '59, and 5-2 in '60. after that i don't
know, but i do know that sixteen years later he was still in cell 14 of
cellblock 5. by then â€“ 1975 - he was fifty-seven. they probably would have gotten
big-hearted and let him out around 1983. they give you life, and that's what
they take-all of it that counts, anyway. maybe they set you loose someday, but .
. . ..
well, listen: i knew this guy, sherwood bolton, his name was, and he had
this pigeon in his cell. f

and jake flew away just as pretty as you could want. but about a week after
sherwood bolton left our happy little family, a friend of mine called me over to
the west corner of the exercise yard, where sherwood used to hang out. a bird
was lying there like a very small pile of dirty bed-linen. it looked starved. my
friend said: "isn't that jake, red?" it was. that pigeon was just as dead as a
turd.
i remember the first time andy dufresne got in touch with me for something; i
remember like it was yesterday. that wasn't the time he wanted rita hayworth,
though. that came later. in that summer of 1948 he came around for something
else.
most of my deals are done right there in the exercise yard, and that's where

andy
walked up. i knew who he was, of course; he had a reputation for being a snob
and a cold fish. people were saying he was marked for trouble already. one of
the people saying so was bogs diamond, a bad man to have on your case. andy had
no cellmate, and i'd heard that was just the way he wanted it, although people
were already saying he thought his shit smelled sweeter than the ordinary. but i
don't have to listen to rumors about a man when i can judge him for myself.
"hello," he said. "i'm andy dufresne." he offered his hand and i shook it. he
wasn't a man to waste time being social; he got right to the point. "i
understand that you're a man who knows how to get things . "
i agreed that i was able to locate certain items from time to time.
"how do you do that?" andy asked.
"sometimes," i said, "things just seem to come into my hand. i can't explain it.
unless it's because i'm irish."
he smiled a little at that. "i wonder if you could get me a rock hammer. "

l back to where it had come from-just a quick and
easy-looking flick of the wrist, but that throw had some mustard on it, just the

about their business. probably the guards in the tower were watching, too. i
won't gild the lily; there are cons that swing weight in any prison, maybe four
or five in a small one, maybe two or three dozen in a big one. at shawshank i
was one of those with some weight, and what i thought of andy dufresne would
have a lot to do with how his time went. he probably knew it, too, but he wasn't
kowtowing or sucking up to me, and i respected him for that.
"fair enough. i'll tell you what it is and why i want it. a rock hammer looks
like a miniature pickaxe-about so long." he held his hands about a foot apart,
and that was when i first noticed how neatly kept his nails were. "it's got a
small sharp pick on one end and a flat, blunt hammerhead on the other. i want it
because i like rocks."

-maybe two or three someones-into the block, and, yes, even into
diamond's cell.
of course a job like that would have cost a lot of money. not by outside
standards, no. prison economics are on a smaller scale. when you've been in here
awhile, a dollar bill in your hand looks like a twenty did outside. my guess is
that, if bogs was done, it cost someone a serious piece of change-fifteen bucks,
we'll say, for the turnkey, and two or three apiece for each of the lump-up
guys.
i'm not saying it was andy dufresne, but i do know that he brought in five
hundred dollars when he came, and he was a banker in the straight world-a man
who understands better than the rest of us the ways in which money can become
power.
and i know this: after the beating-the three broken ribs, the hemorrhaged eye,
the sprained back, and the dislocated hip-bogs diamond left andy alone. in fact,
after that he left everyone pretty much alone. he got to be like a high wind in
the summertime, all bluster and no bite. you could say, i

n fact, that he turned
into a "weak sister."
that was the end of bogs diamond, a man who might eventually have killed andy if
andy hadn't taken steps to prevent it (if it was him who took the steps). but it
wasn't the end of andy's trouble with the sisters. there was a little hiatus,
and then it began again, although not so hard or so often. jackals like easy
prey, and there were easier pickings around than andy dufresne.
he always fought them, that's what i remember. he knew, i guess, that if you let
them have at you even once without fighting, it got that much easier to let them
have their way without fighting next time. so andy would turn up with bruises on
his face every once in awhile, and there was the matter of the two broken
fingers six or eight months after diamond's beating. oh yes-and sometime in late
1949, the man landed in the infirmary with a broken cheekbone that was probably
the result of someon

pieces? hours and hours after
lights-out, i knew that. first the chipping and shaping, and then the almost
endless polishing and finishing with those rock-blankets. looking at them, i
felt the warmth that any man or woman feels when he or she is looking at
something pretty, something that has been worked and made-that's the thing that
really separates us from the animals, i think-and i felt something else, too. a
sense of awe for the man's brute persistence. but i never knew just how
persistent andy dufresne could be until much later.
in may of 1950, the powers that be decided that the roof of the license-plate
factory ought to be re-surfaced with roofing tar. they wanted it done before it
got too hot up there, and they asked for volunteers for the work, which was
planned to take about a week. more than seventy men spoke up, because it was
outside work and may is one damn fine month for outside work. nine or ten names
were drawn out of a hat, and two of them happened to be andy's and my own.

he lapsed into a morose silence, thinking of what terrible bad luck he'd had to
inherit that thirty-five thousand dollars. andy dufresne had been spreading tar
with a big brush less than fifteen feet away and now he tossed it into his
pail and walked over to where mert and hadley were sitting.
we all tightened up, and i saw one of the other screws, tim youngblood, drag his
hand down to where his pistol was holstered. one of the fellows in the sentry
tower struck his partner on the arm and they both turned, too. for one moment i
thought andy was going to get shot, or clubbed, or both.
then he said, very softly, to hadley: "do you

minutes we felt like free men. we could have been drinking beer and tarring the

only andy didn't drink. i already told you about his drinking habits. he sat
hunkered down in the shade, hands dangling between his knees, watching us and
smiling a little. it's amazing how many men remember him that way, and amazing
how many men were on that work-crew when andy dufresne faced down byron hadley.
i thought there were nine or ten of us, but by 1955 there must have been two
hundred of us, maybe more . . . if you believed what you heard.
so, yeah-if you asked me to give you a flat-out answer to the question of
whether i'm trying to tell you about a man or a legend that got made up around
the man, like a pearl around a little piece of grit-i'd have to say that the
answer lies somewhere in between. all i know for sure is that andy dufresne

by world series time of 1950-this was the year the philadelphia whiz kids
dropped four straight, you will remember-andy was having no more trouble from
the sisters. stammas and hadley had passed the word. if andy dufresne came to
either of them, or any of the other screws that formed a part of their coterie,
and showed so much as a single drop of blood in his underpants, every sister in
shawshank would go to bed that night with a headache. they didn't fight it. as i
have pointed out, there was always an eighteen-year old car thief or a firebug
or some guy who'd gotten his kicks handling little children. after the day on
the plate-shop roof, andy went his way and the sisters went theirs.

 exactly what he meant . . . and when i did, the first thing i thought of was
normaden, and about how he'd said it was always cold in andy's cell.
a terrible thing happened to andy in late march or early april of 1963. i have
told you that he had something that most of the other prisoners, myself
included, seemed to lack. call it a sense of equanimity, or a feeling of inner
peace, maybe even a constant and unwavering faith that someday the long
nightmare would end.
whatever you want to call it, andy dufresne always seemed to have his act
together. there was none of that sullen desperation about him that seems to
afflict most lifers after awhile; you could never smell hopelessness on him.
until that late winter of '63.
we had another warden by then, a man named samuel norton. the mathers, cotton
and increase, would have felt right at home with sam norton. so far as i know,
no one had ever seen him so much as crack a smile. he had a thirty-year pin from
the baptist advent church of eliot. his major i
 
 ___________________________
 
all his inside-outers were
committed elsewhere. it has always been something of a wonder to me that norton
was never found in the trunk of a thunderbird parked off a highway somewhere
down in massachusetts with his hands tied behind his back and half a dozen
bullets in his head.
anyway, as the old barrelhouse song says, my god, how the money rolled in.
norton must have subscribed to the old puritan notion that the best way to
figure out which folks god favors is by checking their bank accounts.
andy dufresne was his right hand in all of this, his silent partner. the prison
library was andy's hostage to fortune. norton knew it, and norton used it. andy
told me that one of norton's favorite aphorisms was one hand washes the other.
so andy gave good advice and made useful suggestions. i can't say for sure that
he handtooled norton's inside-out program, but i'm damned sure he processed the
money for the jesus-shouting son of a whore. he gave good advice, made useful
suggestions, the money got spread ar

high school equivalency tests. tommy would brush up on the subjects he had
passed in high school-there weren't many-and then take the test. andy also saw
that he was enrolled in a number of correspondence courses covering the subjects
he had failed in school or just missed by dropping out.
he probably wasn't the best student andy ever took over the jumps, and i don't
know if he ever did get his high school diploma, but that forms no part of my
story. the important thing was that he came to like andy dufresne very much, as
most people did after awhile.
on a couple of occasions he asked andy "what a smart guy like you is doing in
the joint"-a question which is the rough equivalent of that one that goes
"what's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?" but andy wasn't the
type to tell him; he would only smile and turn the conversation into some other
channel. quite normally, tommy asked someone else, and when he finally got the
story, i guess he also got the shock of his young life.

ke up he was in solitary, and confined to same for a week, riding a boxcar
on sam norton's famous grain and drain train. plus a black mark on his report
card.
that was in early february of 1963, and tommy williams went around to six or
seven other long-timers after he got out of solitary and got pretty much the
same story. i know; i was one of them. but when i asked him why he wanted it, he
just clammed up.
then one day he went to the library and spilled one helluva big budget of
information to andy dufresne. and for the first and last time, at least since he
had approached me about the rita hayworth poster like a kid buying his first
pack of trojans, andy lost his cool . . . only this time he blew it entirely.
i saw him later that day, and he looked like a man who has stepped on the
business end of a rake and given himself a good one, whap between the eyes. his
hands were trembling, and when i spoke to him, he didn't answer. before that
afternoon was out he had caught up with billy hanlon, who was

you what surprises me most about it, dufresne."
"what's that, sir?"
"that you were taken in by it."

"sir? i don't understand what you mean." and chester said that andy dufresne,
who had faced down byron hadley on the plate-shop roof thirteen years before, was
almost floundering for words.

impressed with you. quite taken with you, as a matter of fact. he hears your tale of woe,
and it's quite natural of him to want to . . . cheer you up, let's say. quite natural. he's a

n be said in favor of solitary, it's just that you get time to think. andy
had twenty days in which to think while he enjoyed his grain and drain, and when he got
out he requested another meeting with the warden. request denied. such a meeting, the
warden told him, would be "counter-productive." that's another of those phrases you have
to master before you can go to work in the prisons and corrections held.
patiently, andy renewed his request. and renewed it. and renewed it. he had changed,
had andy dufresne. suddenly, as that spring of 1963 bloomed around us, there were lines
in his face and sprigs of gray showing in his hair. he had lost that little trace of a smile that
always seemed to linger around his mouth. his eyes stared out into space more often, and
you get to know that when a man stares that way, he is counting up the years served, the
months, the weeks, the days.

he got up. "you think it over," he said casually, just as the inside whistle

free man a proposition. and for awhile just that was enough to make melees free.
andy could do that. he could make me forget for a time that we were both lifers,
at the mercy of a hard-ass parole board and a psalm-singing warden who liked
andy dufresne right where he was. after all, andy was a lap-dog who could do
tax-returns. what a wonderful animal! but by that night in my cell i felt like a
prisoner again. the whole idea seemed absurd, and that mental image of blue
water and white beaches seemed more cruel than foolish-it dragged at my brain
like a fishhook. i just couldn't wear that invisible coat the way andy did. i

-two, and he was billowing clouds of lime-dust behind him all i
can figure is that, it being friday afternoon and all, the guards going off were
so happy to be going off, and the guards coming on were so downhearted to be
coming on, that the members of the former group never got their heads out of the
clouds and those in the latter never got their noses off their shoe tops . . .
and old sid nedeau just sort of slipped out between the two.
so far as i know, sid is still at large. over the years, andy dufresne and i had
a good many laughs over sid nedeau's great escape, and when we heard about that
airline hijacking for ransom, the one where the guy parachuted from the back
door of the airplane, andy swore up and down that d. b. cooper's real name was
sid nedeau.
"and he probably had a pocketful of baseline lime in his pocket for good luck,"
andy said. "that lucky son of a bitch."
but you should understand that a case like sid nedeau, or the fellow who got

andy had brains and he had heart. norton was determined to use the one and crush
the other.
as there are honest politicians on the outside-ones who stay bought-there are
honest prison guards, and if you are a good judge of character and if you have
some loot to spread around, i suppose it's possible that you could buy enough
look-the-other-way to make a break. i'm not the man to tell you such a thing has
never been done, but andy dufresne wasn't the man who could do it. because, as
i've said, norton was watching. andy knew it, and the screws knew it, too.
nobody was going to nominate andy for the inside-out program, not as long as
warden norton was evaluating the nominations. and andy was not the kind of man
to try a casual sid nedeau type of escape.
if i had been him, the thought of that key would have tormented me endlessly. i
would have been lucky to get two hours' worth of honest shut-eye a night. buxton

der norton's thumb. maybe tommy williams could be
shut up by nothing more than a cushy furlough program, but i wasn't entirely
sure. maybe a good old mississippi hard-ass lawyer could crack him . . . and
maybe that lawyer wouldn't even have to work that hard. williams had honestly
liked andy. every now and then i'd bring these points up to andy, who would only
smile, his eyes far away, and say he was thinking about it.
apparently he'd been thinking about a lot of other things, as well.
in 1975, andy dufresne escaped from shawshank. he hasn't been recaptured, and i
don't think he ever will be. in fact, i don't think andy dufresne even exists
anymore. but i think there's a man down in zihuatanejo, mexico, named peter

, and i was laughing so
hard i didn't know if he meant me or tremont. i just went on laughing and
kicking my feet and holding onto my belly. i couldn't have stopped if norton had
threatened to shoot me dead-bang on the spot. "get him out!"
well, friends and neighbors, i was the one who went. straight down to solitary,
and there i stayed for fifteen days. a long shot. but every now and then i'd
think about poor old not-too-bright rory tremont bellowing oh shit it's shit,
and then i'd think about andy dufresne heading south in his own car, dressed in
a nice suit, and i'd just have to laugh. i did that fifteen days in solitary
practically standing on my head. maybe because half of me was with andy
dufresne, andy dufresne who had waded in shit and came out clean on the other
side, andy dufresne, headed for the pacific.
i heard the rest of what went on that night from half a dozen sources. there
wasn't all that much, anyway. i guess that rory tremont decided he didn't have
much left to lose after he'd l

 after that memorable day, warden norton resigned. he was a broken
man, it gives me great pleasure to report. the spring was gone from his step. on
his last day he shuffled act with his head down like an old con shuffling down
to the infirmary for his codeine pills. it was gonyar who took over, and to
norton that must have seemed like the unkindest cut of all. for all i knee, sam
norton is down there in eliot now, attending services at the baptist church
every sunday, and wondering how the hell andy dufresne ever could have gotten
the better of him.
i could have told him; the answer to the question is simplicity itself. some
have got it, sam. and some don't, and never will.

that's what i know; now i'm going to tell you what i think i may have it wrong
on some of the specifics, but i'd be willing to let my watch and chain that i've
got the general outline down pretty well. because, with andy being the sort of
man that he was, there's only one or two ways that it could have been. and every

pressed excitement. at the time i thought
it was just embarrassment, that andy was the sort of guy who'd never want
someone else to know that he had feet of clay and wanted a woman . . .
especially if it was a fantasy-woman. but i think now that i was wrong. i think
now that andy's excitement came from something else altogether.
what was responsible for the hole that warden norton eventually found behind the
poster of a girl that hadn't even been born when that photo of rita hayworth was
taken? andy dufresne's perseverance and hard work, yeah - i don't take any of that

away from him. but there were two other elements in the equation: a lot of luck,
and wpa concrete.
you don't need me to explain the luck, i guess. the wpa concrete i checked out
for myself. i invested some time and a couple of stamps and wrote first to the
university of maine history department and then to a fellow whose address they
were able to give me. this fellow had been foreman of the wpa project that built

can get the sand-mix too thick or too thin, and the same is true of the
gravel-mix. and back in 1934, the science of mixing the stuff was a lot less
sophisticated than it is today.
the walls of cellblock 5 were solid enough, but they weren't exactly dry and
toasty. as a matter or fact, they were and are pretty damned dank. after a long
wet spell they would sweat and sometimes even drip. cracks had a way of
appearing, some an inch deep. they were routinely mortared over.
now here comes andy dufresne into cellblock 5. he's a man who graduated from the
university of maine's school of business, but he's also a man who took two or
three geology courses along the e way. geology had, in fact, become his chief
hobby. i imagine it appealed to his patient, meticulous nature. a

i remembered the sunday after i had gotten him the rockhammer. i remember
watching him walk across the exercise yard, his face puffy from his latest
go-round with the sisters. i saw him stoop, pick up a pebble . . . and it
disappeared up his sleeve. that inside sleeve-pocket is an old prison trick. up
your sleeve or just inside the cuff of your pants. and i have another memory,
very strong but unfocused, maybe something i saw more than once. this memory is
of andy dufresne walking across the exercise yard on a hot summer day when the
air was utterly still. still, yeah . . . except for the little breeze that
seemed to be blowing sand around andy dufresne's feet. so maybe he had a couple
of cheaters in his pants below the knees. you loaded the cheaters up with fill
and then just strolled around, your hands in your pockets, and when you felt
safe and unobserved, you gave the pockets a little twitch. the pockets, of
course, are attached by string or strong thread to

nishing up on january 14th, 1976. i've used three
pencils right down to knuckle-stubs, and a whole tablet of paper. i've kept the 
81
pages carefully hidden. . . not that many could read my hen-tracks, anyway.
it stirred up more memories than i ever would have believed. writing about
yourself seems to be a lot like sticking a branch into clear river-water and
roiling up the muddy bottom.
well, you weren't writing about yourself i hear someone in the peanut-gallery
saying. you were writing about andy dufresne. you're nothing but a minor
character in your own story. but you know, that's just not so. it's all about
me, every damned word of it. andy was the part of me they could never lock up,
the part of me that will rejoice when the gates finally open for me and i walk
out in my cheap suit with my twenty dollars of mad-money in my pocket. that part
of me will rejoice no matter how old and broken and scared the rest of me is. i
guess it's just that andy had more of that part than me, and used it bette

ht years, three lawyers died on me), my parole was granted. i suppose
they decided that, at the age of fifty-eight, i was finally used up enough to be
deemed safe.
i came very close to burning the document you have just read. they search
outgoing parolees almost as carefully as they search incoming "new fish." and
beyond containing enough dynamite to assure me of a quick turnaround and another
six or eight years inside, my "memoirs" contained something else: the name of
the town where i believe andy dufresne to be. mexican police gladly cooperate
with the american police, and i didn't want my freedom-or my unwillingness to
give up the story i'd worked so long and hard to write-to cost andy his.
then i remembered how andy had brought in his five hundred dollars back in 1948,
and i took out my story of him the same way. just to be on the safe side, i
carefully rewrote each page which mentioned zihuatanejo. if the papers had been
found during my "outside search," as they call it at the shank, i would

wondering what i should do.
but there's really no question. it always comes down to just two choices. get
busy living or get busy dying.
first i'm going to put this manuscript back in my bag. then i'm going to buckle
it up, grab my coat, go downstairs, and check out of this fleabag. then i'm
going to walk uptown to a bar and put that five-dollar bill down in front of the
bartender and ask him to bring me two straight shots of jack daniel's-one for me
and one for andy dufresne. other than a beer or two, they'll be the first drinks
i've taken as a free man since 1938. then i am going to tip the bartender a
dollar and thank him kindly. i will leave the bar and walk up spring street to
the greyhound terminal there and buy a bus ticket to el paso by way of new york
city. when i get to el paso, i'm going to buy a ticket to mcnary. and when i get
to mcnary, i guess i'll have a chance to find out if an old crook like me can
