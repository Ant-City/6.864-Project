parris turns now, with new fear, and goes to betty, looks down at her, and then, 
gazing  off:  oh,  abigail,  what  proper  payment  for  my  charity!  now  i  am 
undone. 
 
putnam: you are not undone! let you take hold here. wait for no one to charge

proctor:  be  you  foolish,  mary  warren?  be  you  deaf?  i  for-bid  you  leave  the

proctor: i’ll show you a great doin' on your arse one of these days. now get you 
home; my wife is waitin’ with your work! trying to retain a shred of dignity, 
she goes slowly out. 
 
mercy lewis, both afraid of him and strangely titillated: i’d best be off. i have 
my ruth to watch. good morning, mr. proctor. 
 
mercy  sidles  out.  since  proctor’s  entrance,  abigail  has  stood  as  though  on 
tiptoe, absorbing his presence, wide-eyed. he glances at her, then goes to betty 
on the bed. 
 
abigail: gah! i’d almost forgot how strong you are, john proctor!

his face: what’s this mischief

the singing has stopped in the midst of this, and now parris rushes in. 
 
parris: what happened? what are you doing to her? betty! he rushes to the bed, crying, 
“betty,  betty!”  mrs.  putnam  enters,  feverish  with  curiosity,  and  with  her  thomas 
putnam and mercy lewis. parris, at the bed, keeps lightly slapping betty’s face, while 
she moans and tries to get up. 
 
abigail: she heard you singin’ and suddenly she’s up and screamin’. 
 
mrs. putnam: the psalm! the psalm! she cannot bear to hear the lord’s name!

suddenly,  from  an  accusa-tory  attitude,  her  face  turns,  looking  into  the  air 
above - it is truly frightened. 
 
danforth, apprehensively: what is it, child? 
 
abigail, looking about in the air, clasping her arms about her as though cold: i
