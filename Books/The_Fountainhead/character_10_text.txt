i offer my profound gratitude to the great profession of architecture and its heroes who have 
given us some of the highest expressions of man's genius, yet have remained unknown, 
undiscovered by the majority of men. and to the architects who gave me their generous 
assistance in the technical matters of this book.

howard roark laughed.

he stood naked at the edge of a cliff. the lake lay far below him. a frozen explosion of granite 
burst in flight to the sky over motionless water. the water seemed immovable, the stone--
flowing. the stone had the stillness of one brief moment in battle when thrust meets thrust 
and the currents are held in a pause more dynamic than motion. the stone glowed, wet with 
sunrays.

the lake below was only a thin steel ring that cut the rocks in half. the rocks went on i

one. for him, the streets were empty. he 
could have walked there naked without concern. he crossed the heart of stanton, a broad 
green edged by shop windows. the windows displayed new placards announcing:

welcome to the class of  '22!  good luck,  class of  '22!  the class of '22 of the 
stanton institute of technology was holding its commencement exercises that afternoon.

roark swung into a side street, where at the end of a long row, on a knoll over a green ravine, 
stood the house of mrs. keating. he had boarded at that house for three years.

mrs. keating was out on the porch. she was feeding a couple of canaries in a cage 
suspended over the railing. her pudgy little hand stopped in mid-air when she saw him. she 
watched him with curiosity. she tried to pull her mouth into a proper expression of sympathy; 
she succeeded only in betraying that the process was an effort.

he was crossing the porch without noticing her. she stopped him.

"mr. roark!"

"yes?"

"mr. roark, i'm so sorry abo

n door, watching his gaunt figure move across 
the rigid neatness of her parlor. he always made her uncomfortable in the house, with a 
vague feeling of apprehension, as if she were waiting to see him swing out suddenly and 
smash her coffee tables, her chinese vases, her framed photographs. he had never shown 
any inclination to do so. she kept expecting it, without knowing why.

roark went up the stairs to his room. it was a large, bare room, made luminous by the clean 
glow of whitewash. mrs. keating had never had the feeling that roark really lived there. he 
had not added a single object to the bare necessities of furniture which she had provided; no 
pictures, no pennants, no cheering human touch. he had brought nothing to the room but his 
clothes and his drawings; there were few clothes and too many drawings; they were stacked 
high in one comer; sometimes she thought that the drawings lived there, not the man.

roark walked now to these drawings; they were the first things to be packe

e had missed. glancing at it now, 
unprepared, he saw the mistake he had made.

he flung the sketch down on the table, he bent over it, he slashed lines straight through his 
neat drawing. he stopped once in a while and stood looking at it, his fingertips pressed to the 
paper; as if his hands held the building. his hands had long fingers, hard veins, prominent 
joints and wristbones.

an hour later he heard a knock at his door.

"come in!" he snapped, without stopping.

"mr. roark!" gasped mrs. keating, staring at him from the threshold. "what on earth are you 
doing?"

he turned and looked at her, trying to remember who she was.

"how about the dean?" she moaned. "the dean that's waiting for you?"

"oh," said roark. "oh, yes. i forgot."

"you...forgot?"

"yes." there was a note of wonder in his voice, astonished by her astonishment.

"well, all i can say," she choked, "is that it serves you right! it just serves you right. and with 
the commencement beginning at four-thirty, how do you expec

t him to have time to see you?"

"i'll go at once, mrs. keating."

it was not her curiosity alone that prompted her to action; it was a secret fear that the 
sentence of the board might be revoked. he went to the bathroom at the end of the hall; she 
watched him washing his hands, throwing his loose, straight hair back into a semblance of 
order. he came out again, he was on his way to the stairs before she realized that he was 
leaving.

"mr. roark!" she gasped, pointing at his clothes. "you're not going like this?"

"why not?"

"but it's your dean!"

"not

 any more, mrs. keating."

she thought, aghast, that he said it as if he were actually happy.

the stanton institute of technology stood on a hill, its crenelated walls raised as a crown over 
the city stretched below. it looked like a medieval fortress, with a gothic cathedral grafted to 
its belly. the fortress was eminently suited to its purpose, with stout, brick walls, a few slits 
wide enough for sentries, ramparts behind which defending archers could hide, and corner

eapples particularly, thought guy francon, had stood the test of years very well. it is, 
thought guy francon, touching; it was i who built this annex and this very hall, twenty years 
ago; and here i am.

the hall was packed with bodies and faces, so tightly that one could not distinguish at a 
glance which faces belonged to which bodies. it was like a soft, shivering aspic made of 
mixed arms, shoulders, chests and stomachs. one of the heads, pale, dark haired and 
beautiful, belonged to peter keating.

he sat, well in front, trying to keep his eyes on the platform, because he knew that many 
people were looking at him and would look at him later. he did not glance back, but the 
consciousness of those centered glances never left him. his eyes were dark, alert, intelligent. 
his mouth, a small upturned crescent faultlessly traced, was gentle and generous, and warm 
with the faint promise of a smile. his head had a certain classical perfection in the shape of 
the skull, in the natural wave o

f black ringlets about finely hollowed temples. he held his head 
in the manner of one who takes his beauty for granted, but knows that others do not. he was 
peter keating, star student of stanton, president of the student body, captain of the track 
team, member of the most important fraternity, voted the most popular man on the campus.

the crowd was there, thought peter keating, to see him graduate, and he tried to estimate the 
capacity of the hall. they knew of his scholastic record and no one would beat his record 
today. oh, well, there was shlinker. shlinker had given him stiff competition, but he had 
beaten shlinker this last year. he had worked like a dog, because he had wanted to beat 
shlinker. he had no rivals today....then he felt suddenly as if something had fallen down, 
inside his throat, to his stomach, something cold and empty, a blank hole rolling do

e and gold-rimmed glasses. he stared at shlinker warmly, in relief, in 
reassurance, in gratitude. it was obvious that shlinker could never hope to equal his own 
appearance or ability; he had nothing to doubt; he would always beat shlinker and all the 
shlinkers of the world; he would let no one achieve what he could not achieve. let them all 
watch him. he would give them good reason to stare. he felt the hot breaths about him and 
the expectation, like a tonic. it was wonderful, thought peter keating, to be alive.

his head was beginning to reel a little. it was a pleasant feeling. the feeling carried him, 
unresisting and unremembering, to the platform in front of all those faces. he stood--slender, 
trim, athletic--and let the deluge break upon his head. he gathered from its roar that he had 
graduated with honors, that the architects' guild of america had presented him with a gold 
medal and that he had been awarded the prix de paris by the society for architectural 
enlightenment of the

ocating in his black gown and hoping that people would not 
notice his mother sobbing with her arms about him. the president of the institute shook his 
hand, booming: "stanton will be proud of you, my boy." the dean shook his hand, repeating: 
"...a glorious future...a glorious future...a glorious future..." professor peterkin shook his hand, 
and patted his shoulder, saying: "...and you'll find it absolutely essential; for example, i had the 
experience when i built the peabody post office..." keating did not listen to the rest, because 
he had heard the story of the peabody post office many times. it was the only structure 
anyone had ever known professor peterkin to have erected, before he sacrificed his practice 
to the responsibilities of teaching. a great deal was said about keating's final project--a palace 
of fine arts. for the life of him, keating could not remember at the moment what that project 
was.

through all this, his eyes held the vision of guy francon shaking his hand, and

 his ears held 
the sounds of francon's mellow voice: "...as i have told you, it is still open, my boy. of course, 
now that you have this scholarship...you will have to decide...a beaux-arts diploma is very 
important to a young man...but i should be delighted to have you in our office...."

the banquet of the class of '22 was long and solemn. keating listened to the speeches with 
interest; when he heard the endless sentences about "young men as the hope of american 
architecture" and "the future opening its golden gates," he knew that he was the hope and his 
was the future, and it was pleasant to hear this confirmation from so many eminent lips. he 
looked at the gray-haired orators and thought of how much younger he would be when he 
reached their positions, theirs and beyond them.

then he thought suddenly of howard roark. he was surpri

wo years younger and one class below him. if he had ever 
entertained any doubts on their respective gifts, hadn't this day settled it all? and, he 
remembered, roark had been very nice to him, helping him whenever he was stuck on a 
problem...not stuck, really, just did not have the time to think it out, a plan or something. 
christ! how roark could untangle a plan, like pulling a string and it was open...well, what if he 
could? what did it get him? he was done for now. and knowing this, peter keating 
experienced at last a satisfying pang of sympathy for howard roark.

when keating was called upon to speak, he rose confidently. he could not show that he was 
terrified. he had nothing to say about architecture. but he spoke, his head high, as an equal 
among equals, just subtly diffident, so that no great name present could take offense. he 
remembered saying: "architecture is a great art...with our eyes to the future and the reverence 
of the past in our hearts...of all the crafts, the most

 important one sociologically...and, as the 
man who is an inspiration to us all has said today, the three eternal entities are: truth, love 
and beauty...."

then, in the corridors outside, in the noisy confusion of leave-taking, a boy had thrown an arm 
about keating's shoulders and whispered: "run on home and get out of the soup-and-fish, 
pete, and it's boston for us tonight, just our own gang; i'll pick you up in an hour." ted shlinker 
had urged: "of course you're coming, pete. no fun without you. and, by the way, 
congratulations and all that sort of thing. no hard feelings. may the best man win." keating 
had thrown his arm about shlinker's shoulders; keating's eyes had glowed with an insistent 
kind of warmth, as if shlinker were his most precious fr

iend; keating's eyes glowed like that on 
everybody. he had said: "thanks, ted, old man. i really do feel awful about the a.g.a. 
medal--i think you were the one for it, but you never can tell what possesses those old 
fogies." and now keating was on his way home through the soft darkness, wondering how to 
get away from his mother for the night.

his mother, he thought, had done a great deal for him. as she pointed out frequently, she was 
a lady and had graduated from high school; yet she had worked hard, had taken boarders into 
their home, a concession unprecedented in her family.

his father had owned a stationery store in stanton. changing times had ended the business 
and a hernia had ended peter keating, sr., twelve years ag

o. louisa keating had been left 
with the home that stood at the end of a respectable street, an annuity from an insurance kept 
up accurately--she had seen to that--and her son. the annuity was a modest one, but with the 
help of the boarders and of a tenacious purpose mrs. keating had managed. in the summers 
her son helped, clerking in hotels or posing for hat advertisements. her son, mrs. keating had 
decided, would assume his rightful place in the world, and she had clung to this as softly, as 
inexorably as a leech....it's funny, keating remembered, at one time he had wanted to be an 
artist. it was his mother who had chosen a better field in which to exercise his talent for 
drawing. "architecture," she had said, "is such a respectable profession. besides, you meet 
the best people in it." she had pushed him into his career, he had never known when or how. 
it's funny, thought keatin

g, he had not remembered that youthful ambition of his for years. it's 
funny that it should hurt him now--to remember. well, this was the night to remember it--and 
to forget it forever.

architects, he thought, always made brilliant careers. and once on top, did they ever fail? 
suddenly, he recalled henry cameron; builder of skyscrapers twenty years ago; old drunkard 
with offices on some waterfront today. keating shuddered and walked faster.

he wondered, as he walked, whether people were looking at him. he watched the rectangles 
of lighted windows; when a curtain fluttered and a head leaned out, he tried to guess whether 
it had leaned to watch his passing; if it hadn't, some day it would; some day, they all would.

howard roark was sitting on the porch steps when keating approached the house. he was 
leaning back against the steps, propped up on his elbows, his long legs stretched out. a

their color and gave the promise that in daylight they would be a brighter 
green than had ever existed; it took away one's sight and left a new sense instead, neither 
smell nor touch, yet both, a sense of spring and space.

keating stopped when he recognized the preposterous orange hair in the darkness of the 
porch. it was the one person whom he had wanted to see tonight. he was glad to find roark 
alone, and a little afraid of it.

"congratulations, peter," said roark.

"oh...oh, thanks...." keating was surprised to find that he felt more pleasure than from any 
other compliment he had received today. he was timidly glad that roark approved, and he 
called himself inwardly a fool for it. "...i mean...do you know or..." he added sharply: "has 
mother been telling you?"

"she has."

"she shouldn't have!"

"why not?"

"look, howard, you know that i'm terribly sorry about your being..."

roark threw his head back and looked up at him.

"forget it," said roark.

"i...there's something i want to

 speak to you about, howard, to ask your advice. mind if i sit 
down?"

"what is it?"

keating sat down on the steps beside him. there was no part that he could ever play in 
roark's presence. besides, he did not feel like playing a part now. he heard a leaf rustling in 
its fall to the earth; it was a thin, glassy, spring sound.

he knew, for the moment, that he felt affection for roark; an affection that held pain, 
astonishment and helplessness.

"you won't think," said keating gently, in complete sincerity, "that it's awful of me to be asking 
about my business, when you've just been...?"

"i said forget about that. what is it?"

"you know," said keating honestly and unexpectedly even to himself, "i've often thought that 
you're crazy. but i know that you know many things about it--architecture, i mean--which those 
fools never knew. and i know that you love it as they never will."

"well?"

"well, i don't know why i should come to you, but--howard, i've never said i

t before, but you 
see, i'd rather have your opinion on things than the dean's--i'd probably follow the dean's, but 
it's just that yours means more to me myself, i don't know why. i don't know why i'm saying 
this, either."

roark turned over on his side, looked at him, and laughed. it was a young, kind, friendly 
laughter, a thing so rare to hear from roark that keating felt as if someone had taken his hand
in reassurance; and he forgot that he had a party in boston waiting for him.

"come on," said roark, "you're not being afraid of me, are you? what do you want to ask 
about?"

"it's about my scholarship. the paris prize i got."

"yes?"

"it's for four years. but, on the other hand, guy francon offered me a job with him some time 
ago. today he said it's still open. and i don't know which to take."

roark looked at him; roark's fingers moved in slow rotation

how can you stand it, not to know?"

"you see, that's what i admire about you, howard. you always know."

"drop the compliments."

"but i mean it. how do you always manage to decide?"

"how can you let others decide for you?"

"but you see, i'm not sure, howard. i'm never sure of myself. i don't know whether i'm as good 
as they all tell me i am. i wouldn't admit that to anyone but you. i think it's because you're 
always so sure that i..."

"petey!" mrs. keating's voice exploded behind them. "petey, sweetheart! what are you doing 
there?"

she stood in the doorway, in her best dress of burgundy taffeta, happy and angry.

"and here i've been sitting all alone, waiting for you! what on earth are you doing on those 
filthy steps in your dress suit? get up this minute! come on in the house, boys. i've got hot 

chocolate and cookies ready for you."

"but, mother. i wanted to speak to howard about something important," said keating. but he

she seemed not to have heard. she walked into the house. keating followed.

roark looked after them, shrugged, rose and went in also.

mrs. keating settled down in an armchair, her stiff skirt crackling.

"well?" she asked. "what were you two discussing out there?"

keating fingered an ash tray, picked up a matchbox and dropped it, then, ignoring her, turned 
to roark.

"look, howard, drop the pose," he said, his voice high. "shall i junk the scholarship and go to 
work, or let francon wait and grab the beaux-arts to impress the yokels? what do you think?"

something was gone. the one moment was lost.

"now, petey, let me get this straight
 
 ___________________________
 
..." began mrs. keating.

"oh, wait a minute, mother!...howard, i've got to weigh it carefully. it isn't everyone who can 
get a scholarship like that. you're pretty good when you rate that. a course at the beaux-arts--
you know how important that is."

"i don't," said roark.

"oh, hell, i know your crazy ideas, but i'm speaking practically, for a man in my position. ideals 
aside for a moment, it certainly is..."

"you don't want my advice," said roark.

"of course i do! i'm asking you!"

but keating could never be the same when he had an audience, any audience. something 
was gone. he did not know it, but he felt that roark knew; roark's eyes made him 
uncomfortable and that made him angry.

"i want to practice architecture," snapped keating, "not talk about it! gives you a great 
prestige--the old école. puts you above the rank and file of the ex-plumbers who think they 
can build. on the other hand, an opening with francon--guy francon himself offering it!"

roark turned away.

"how man

y boys will match that?" keating went on blindly. "a year from now they'll be 
boasting they're working for smith or jones if they find work at all. while i'll be with francon & 
heyer!"

"you're quite right, peter," said mrs. keating, rising. "on a question like that you don't want to 
consult your mother. it's too important. i'll leave you to settle it with mr. roark."

he looked at his mother. he did not want to hear what she thought of this; he knew that his 
only chance to decide was to make the decision before he heard her; she had stopped, 
looking at him, ready to turn and leave the room; he knew it was not a pose--she would leave 
if he wished it; he wanted her to go; he wanted it desperately. he said:

"why, mother
 
 ___________________________
 
, how can you say that? of course i want your opinion. what...what do you 
think?"

she ignored the raw irritation in his voice. she smiled.

"petey, i never think anything. it's up to you. it's always been up to you."

"well..." he began hesitantly, watching her, "if i go to the beaux-arts..."

"fine," said mrs. keating, "go to the beaux-arts. it's a grand place. a whole ocean away from 
your home. of course, if you go, mr. francon will take somebody else. people will talk about 
that. everybody knows that mr. francon picks out the best boy from stanton every year for his 
office. i wonder how it'll look if some other boy gets the job? but i guess that doesn't matter."

"what...what will people say?"

"nothing much, i guess. only that the other boy was the best man of his class. i guess he'll 
take shlinker."

is fact was 
recognized by everybody as meaning automatically that he loved her, and so he took for 
granted mat whatever he felt for her was love. he did not know whether there was any reason 
why he should respect her judgment. she was his mother; this was supposed to take the 
place of reasons.

"yes, of course, mother....but...yes, i know, but.. howard?"

it was a plea for help. roark was there, on a davenport in the corner, half lying, sprawled 
limply like a kitten. it had often astonished keating; he had seen roark moving with the 
soundless tension, the control, the precision of a cat; he had seen him relaxed, like a cat, in 
shapeless ease, as if his body held no single solid bone. roark glanced up at him. he said:

"peter, you know how i feel about either one of your opportunities. take your choice of the 
lesser evil. what will you learn at the beaux-arts? only more renaissance palaces and 
operetta settings. they'll kill everything you might have in you. you do good work, once in a

and a fool, but you will be building. it will prepare you for going on your own that much

"even mr. roark can talk sense sometimes," said mrs. keating, "even if he does talk like a 
truck driver."

"do you really think that i do good work?" keating looked at him, as if his eyes still held the 
reflection of that one sentence--and nothing else mattered.

"occasionally," said roark. "not often."

"now that it's all settled..." began mrs. keating.

"i...i'll have to think it over, mother."

"now that it's all settled, how about the hot chocolate? i'll have it out to you in a jiffy!"

she smiled at her son, an innocent smile that declared her obedience and gratitude, and she 
rustled out of the room.

keating paced nervously, stopped, lighte

"for god's sake, you can't go on like that, deliberately ruining yourself! i thought...well, yes, i

"i have."

"look, howard, if it's because you think that no one else will have you now, no one better, 
why, i'll help you. i'll work old francon and i'll get connections and..."

"thank you, peter. but it won't be necessary. it's settled.

"what did he say?"

"who?"

"cameron."

"i've never met him."

then a horn screamed outside. keating remembered, started off to change his clothes, 
collided with his mother at the door and knocked a cup off her loaded tray.

"petey!"

"never mind, mother!" he seized her elbows. "i'm in a hurry, sweetheart. a little party with the 
boys--now, now, don't say anything--i won't be late and--look! we'll celebrate my going with 
francon & heyer!"

he kissed her impulsively, with the gay exuberance that made him irresistible at times, and 
flew out of the room, up the stairs. mrs. keating shook her

 head, flustered, reproving and 
happy.

in his room, while flinging his clothes in all directions, keating thought suddenly of a wire he 
would send to new york. that particular subject had not been in his mind all day, but it came 
to him with a sense of desperate urgency; he wanted to send that wire now, at once. he 
scribbled it down on a piece of paper:

"katie dearest coming new york job francon love ever

"peter"

that night keating raced toward boston, wedged in between two boys, the wind and the road 
whistling past him. and he thought that the world was opening to him now, like the darkness 
fleeing before the bobbing headlights. he was free. he was ready. in a few years--so very 
soon, for time did not exist in the speed of that car--his name would ring like a horn, ripping 
people out of sleep. he was ready to do great things, magnificent things, things unsurpassed 
in...in...oh, hell...in architecture.

 at the men who hurried 
past. smart, he thought, smart as hell. he glanced regretfully at his own clothes. he had a 
great deal to learn in new york.

when he could delay it no longer, he turned to the door. it was a miniature doric portico, every 
inch of it scaled down to the exact proportions decreed by the artists who had worn flowing 
grecian tunics; between the marble perfection of the columns a revolving door sparkled with 
nickel plate, reflecting the streaks of automobiles flying past. keating walked through the 
revolving door, through the lustrous marble lobby, to an elevator of gilt and red lacquer that 
brought him, thirty floors later, to a mahogany door. he saw a slender brass plate with delicate 
letters:

francon & heyer, architects.

the reception room of the office of francon & heyer, architects, looked like a cool, intimate 
ballroom in a colonial mansion. the silver white walls were paneled with flat pilasters; the 
pilasters were fluted and curved into ionic snails; they

 supported little pediments broken in the 
middle to make room for half a grecian urn plastered against the wall. etchings of greek 
temples adorned the panels, too small to be distinguished, but presenting the unmistakable 
columns, pediments and crumbling stone.

quite incongruously, keating felt as if a conveyor belt was under his feet, from the moment he 
crossed the threshold. it carried him to the reception clerk who sat at a telephone switchboard 
behind the white balustrade of a florentine balcony. it transferred him to the threshold of a 
huge drafting room. he saw long, flat tables, a forest of twisted rods descending from the 
ceiling to end in green-shaded lamps, enormous blueprint files, towers of yellow drawers, 
papers, tin boxes, sample bricks, pots of glue and calend

ars from construction companies, 
most of them bearing pictures of naked women. the chief draftsman snapped at keating, 
without quite seeing him. he was bored and crackling with purpose simultaneously. he jerked 

his thumb in the direction of a locker room, thrust his chin out toward the door of a locker, and 
stood, rocking from heels to toes, while keating pulled a pearl-gray smock over his stiff, 
uncertain body. francon had insisted on that smock. the conveyor belt stopped at a table in a 
corner of the drafting room, where keating found himself with a set of plans to expand, the 
scaggy back of the chief draftsman retreating from him in the unmistakable manner of having 
forgotten his existence.

keating bent over his task at once, his eyes fixed, his throat rigid. he saw nothing but the 
pearly shimmer of the paper before him. the steady line

e sheet. he followed the 
lines, not knowing where they led or why. he knew only that the plan was someone's 
tremendous achievement which he could neither question nor equal. he wondered why he 
had ever thought of himself as a potential architect.

much later, he noticed the wrinkles of a gray smock sticking to a pair of shoulder blades over 
the next table. he glanced about him, cautiously at first, then with curiosity, then with pleasure, 
then with contempt. when he reached this last, peter keating became himself again and felt 
love for mankind. he noticed sallow cheeks, a funny nose, a wart on a receding chin, a 
stomach squashed against the edge of a table. he loved these sights. what these could do, 
he could do better. he smiled. peter keating needed his fellow men.

when he glanced at his plans again, he noticed the flaws glaring at him from the masterpiece. 
it was the floor of a private residence, and he noted the twisted hallways that sliced great 
hunks of space for no apparent

reason, the long, rectangular sausages of rooms doomed to 
darkness. jesus, he thought, they'd have flunked me for this in the first term. after which, he 
proceeded with his work swiftly, easily, expertly--and happily.

before lunchtime. keating had made friends in the room, not any definite friends, but a vague 
soil spread and ready from which friendship would spring. he had smiled at his neighbors and 
winked in understanding over nothing at all. he had used each trip to the water cooler to 
caress those he passed with the soft, cheering glow of his eyes, the brilliant eyes that seemed 
to pick each man in turn out of the room, out of the universe, as the most important specimen 
of humanity and as keating's dearest friend. there go

es--there seemed to be left in his wake--
a smart boy and a hell of a good fellow.

keating noticed that a tall blond youth at the next table was doing the elevation of an office 
building. keating leaned with chummy respect against the boy's shoulder and looked at the 
laurel garlands entwined about fluted columns three floors high.

"pretty good for the old man," said keating with admiration.

"who?" asked the boy.

"why, francon," said keating.

"francon hell," said the boy placidly. "he hasn't designed a doghouse in eight years." he 
jerked his thumb over his shoulder, at a glass door behind them. "him."

"what?" asked keating, turning.

"him," said the boy. "stengel. he does all these things."

behind the glass door keating saw a pair of bony shoulders above the edge of a desk, a 
small, triangular head bent intently, and two blank pools of light in the round frames of 
glasses.

it was late in the afternoon when a presence seemed 
 
 ___________________________
 
to have passed beyond the closed door, 
and keating learned from the rustle of whispers around him that guy francon had arrived and 
had risen to his office on the floor above. half an hour later the glass door opened and 
stengel came out, a huge piece of cardboard dangling between his fingers.

"hey, you," he said, his glasses stopping on keating's face. "you doing the plans for this?" he 
swung the cardboard forward. "take this up to the boss for the okay. try to listen to what he'll 

say and try to look intelligent. neither of which matters anyway."

he was short and his arms seemed to hang down to his ankles; arms swinging like ropes in 
the long sleeves, with big, efficient hands. keating's eyes froze, darkening, for one-tenth of a 
second, gathered in a tight stare at the blank lenses. then keating smiled and said pleasantly:

"y

es, sir."

he carried the cardboard on the tips of his ten fingers, up the crimson-plushed stairway to guy 
francon's office. the cardboard displayed a water-color perspective of a gray granite mansion 
with three tiers of dormers, five balconies, four bays, twelve columns, one flagpole and two 
lions at the entrance. in the corner, neatly printed by hand, stood: "residence of mr. and mrs. 
james s. whattles. francon & heyer, architects." keating whistled softly: james s. whattles 
was the multimillionaire manufacturer of shaving lotions.

guy francon's office was polished. no, thought keating, not polished, but shellacked; no, not 
shellacked, but liquid with mirrors melted and poured over every object. he saw splinters of 
his own reflection let loose like a swarm of butterflies, following him across the room, on the 
chippendale cabinets, on the jacobean chairs, on the louis xv mantelpiece. he had time to 
note a genuine roman statue

 in a corner, sepia photographs of the parthenon, of rheims 
cathedral, of versailles and of the frink national bank building with the eternal torch.

he saw his own legs approaching him in the side of the massive mahogany desk. guy 
francon sat behind the desk. guy francon's face was yellow and his cheeks sagged. he 
looked at keating for an instant as if he had never seen him before, then remembered and 
smiled expansively.

"well, well, well, kittredge, my boy, here we are, all set and at home! so glad to see you. sit 
down, boy, sit down, what have you got there? well, there's no hurry, no hurry at all. sit down. 
how do you like it here?"

"i'm afraid, sir, that i'm a little too happy," said keating, with an expression of frank, boyish 
helplessness. "i thought i could be businesslike on my first job, but starting in a p

"of course," said guy francon. "it might be a bit overwhelming for a boy, just a bit. but don't 
you worry. i'm sure you'll make good."

"i'll do my best, sir."

"of course you will. what's this they sent me?" francon extended his hand to the drawing, but 
his fingers came to rest limply on his forehead instead. "it's so annoying, this headache....no, 
no, nothing serious--" he smiled at keating's prompt concern--"just a little mal de tête. one 
works so hard."

"is there anything i can get for you, sir?"

"no, no, thank you. it's not anything you can get for me, it's if only you could take something 
away from me." he winked. "the champagne. entre nous, that champagne of theirs wasn't 
worth a damn last night. i've never cared for champagne anyway. let me tell you, kittredge,

"mr. stengel, sir."

"oh, stengel." the tone in which he pronounced the name clicked like a shutter in keating's 
mind: it was a permission to be stored away for future use. "too grand to bring his own stuff

a little after-dinner speech--you know, nothing blatant, no vulgar 
sales talk--only a few well-chosen thoughts on the responsibility of realtors to society, on the 
importance of selecting architects who are competent, respected and well established. you 
know, a few bright little slogans that will stick in the mind."

"yes, sir, like 'choose the builder of your home as carefully as you choose the bride to inhabit 
it.'"

"not bad. not bad at all, kittredge. mind if i jot it down?"

"my name is keating, sir," said keating firmly. "you are very welcome to the idea. i'm happy if 
it appeals to you."

"keating, of course! why, of course, keating," said francon with a disarming smile. "dear me, 
one meets so many people. how did you say it? choose the builder...it was very well put."

he made keating repeat it and wrote it down on a pad, picking a pencil from an array before 
him, new, many-colored pencils, sharpened to a professional needle point, ready, unused.

hed, patted the smooth waves of his hair and said wearily:

"well, all right, i suppose i'll have to look at the thing."

keating extended the drawing respectfully. francon leaned back, held the cardboard out at 
arm's length and looked at it. he closed his left eye, then his right eye, then moved the 
cardboard an inch farther. keating expected wildly to see him turn the drawing upside down. 
but francon just held it and keating knew suddenly that he had long since stopped seeing it. 
francon was studying it for his, keating's, benefit; and then keating felt light, light as air, and 
he saw the road to his future, clear and open.

"hm...yes," francon was saying, rubbing his chin with the tips of two soft fingers. "hm...yes..."

he turned to keating.

's fingers playing with a petunia-mauve necktie, and decided not to mention it. he 
said instead:

"if i may make a suggestion, sir, it seems to me that the cartouches between the fourth and 
fifth floors are somewhat too modest for so imposing a building. it would appear that an 
ornamented stringcourse would be so much more appropriate."

"that's it. i was just going to say it. an ornamented stringcourse....but...but look, it would 
mean diminishing the fenestration, wouldn't it?"

"yes," said keating, a faint coating of diffidence over the tone he had used in discussions with 
his classmates, "but windows are less important than the dignity of a building's facade."

"that's right. dignity. we must give our clients dignity above all. yes, definitely, an 
ornamented stringcourse....only...look, i've approved the preliminary drawings, and stengel 
has had this done up so neatly."

"mr. stengel will be delighted to change it if you advise him to."

francon's eyes held keating's for a moment. th

en francon's lashes dropped and he picked a 
piece of lint off his sleeve.

"of course, of course..." he said vaguely. "but...do you think the stringcourse is really 
important?"

"i think," said keating slowly, "it is more important to make changes you find necessary than to 
okay every drawing just as mr. stengel designed it."

because francon said nothing, but only looked straight at him, because francon's eyes were 
focused and his hands limp, keating knew that he had taken a terrible chance and won; he 
became frightened by the chance after he knew he had won.

they looked silently across the desk, and both saw that they were two men who could 
understand each other.

"we'll have an ornamented stringcourse," said francon with calm, genuine authority. "leave 
this here. tell stengel that i want to see him."

he had turned to go. francon stopped him. francon's voice was gay and warm:

"oh, keating, by the way, may i make a suggestion? just be

but a burgundy necktie would be so much better than blue with your gray smock, don't you 
think so?"

"yes, sir," said keating easily. "thank you. you'll see it tomorrow."

he walked out and closed the door softly.

on his way back through the reception room, keating saw a distinguished, gray-haired 
gentleman escorting a lady to the door. the gentleman wore no hat and obviously belonged to 
the office; the lady wore a mink cape, and was obviously a client.

the gentleman was not bowing to the ground, he was not unrolling a carpet, he was not 
waving a fan over her head; he was only holding the door for her. it merely seemed to keating 
that the gentleman was doing all of that.

the frink national bank building rose over lower manhattan, and its long shadow

"if you're late, i'll fire you."

roark extended his hand for the drawings.

"leave these here!" bellowed cameron. "now get out!"

"toohey," said guy francon, "ellsworth toohey. pretty decent of him, don't you think? read 
it, peter."

francon leaned jovially across his desk and handed to keating the august issue of new 
frontiers. new frontiers had a white cover with a black emblem that combined a palette, a 
lyre, a hammer, a screw driver and a rising sun; it had a circulation of thirty thousand and a 
following that described itself as the intellectual vanguard of the country; no one had ever 
risen to challenge the description. keating read from an article entitled "marble and mortar," by 
ellsworth m. toohey:

"...and now we come to another notable achievement of the metropolitan s

us that none may rise too high above the restraint of the common human level, that all is held 
and shall be checked, even as this proud edifice, by the stringcourses of men's 
brotherhood...."

there was more. keating read it all, then raised his head. "gee!" he said, awed.

francon smiled happily.

"pretty good, eh? and from toohey, no less. not many people might have heard the name, 
but they will, mark my word, they will. i know the signs....so he doesn't think i'm so bad? and 
he's got a tongue like an icepick, when he feels like using it. you should see what he says 
about others, more often than not. you know durkin's latest mousetrap? well, i was at a party

said: 'if mr. durkin suffers under the delusion 

that he is an architect, someone should mention to him the broad opportunities offered by the 
shortage of skilled plumbers.' that's what he said, imagine, in public!"

"i wonder," said keating wistfully, "what he'll say about me, when the times comes."

"what on earth does he mean by the symbolic significance stuff and the stringcourses of 
men's brotherhood?...oh, well, if that's what he praises us for, we should worry!"

"it's the critic's job to interpret the artist, mr. francon, even to the artist himself. mr. toohey 
has merely stated the hidden significance that was subconsciously in your own mind."

"oh," said francon vaguely. "oh, do you think so?" he added brightly. "quite p

ossible....yes, 
quite possible....you're a smart boy, peter."

"thank you, mr. francon." keating made a movement to rise.

"wait. don't go. one more cigarette and then we'll both return to the drudgery."

francon was smiling over the article, reading it again. keating had never seen him so 
pleased; no drawing in the office, no work accomplished had ever made him as happy as 
these words from another man on a printed page to be read by other eyes.

keating sat easily in a comfortable chair. his month with the firm had been well spent. he had 
said nothing and done nothing, but the impression had spread through the office that guy 
francon liked to see this particular boy sent to him whenever anyone had to be sent. hardly a 
day passed without the pleasant in

ticulously his socks with his handkerchiefs, but never with his neckties; that he 
had a great preference for designing buildings of gray granite; that he owned a quarry of gray 
granite in connecticut, which did a thriving business; that he maintained a magnificent 
bachelor apartment done in plum-colored louis xv; that his wife, of a distinguished old name, 
had died, leaving her fortune to their only daughter, that the daughter, now nineteen, was 
away at college.

these last facts interested keating a great deal. he mentioned to francon, tentatively in 
passing, the subject of his daughter. "oh, yes..." francon said thinly. "yes, indeed..." keating 
abandoned all further research into the matter, for the time being; francon's face had 
declared mat the thought of his daughter was painfully annoying to him, for some reason 
which keating could not discover.

keating had met lucius n. heyer, francon's partner, and had seen him come to the office 
twice in three weeks, but had been unable to

toward everyone. he was the relic of an ancient family, and it was suspected mat francon had 
taken him into partnership for the sake of his social connections. people felt sorry for poor 
dear lucius, admired him for the effort of undertaking a professional career, and thought it 
would be nice to let him build their homes. francon built them and required no further service 
from lucius. this satisfied everybody.

the men in the drafting rooms loved peter keating. he made them feel as if he had been 
there for a long time; he had always known how to become part of any place he entered; he 
came soft and bright as a sponge to be filled, unresisting, with the air and the mood of the 
place. his warm smile, his gay voice, the easy shrug of his shoulders seemed to say that 
nothing weighed too much within his soul and so he was not one to blame, to demand, to 
accuse anything.

as he sat now, watching francon read the article, francon raised his head to gl

ance at him. 
francon saw two eyes looking at him with immense approval--and two bright little points of 
contempt in the corners of keating's mouth, like two musical notes of laughter visible the 
second before they were to be heard. francon felt a great wave of comfort. the comfort came 
from the contempt. the approval, together with that wise half-smile, granted him a grandeur 
he did not have to earn; a blind admiration would have been precarious; a deserved 
admiration would have been a responsibility; an undeserved admiration was precious.

n the stairs, keating flung the magazine high in the air and caught it smartly, 
his lips pursed to whistle without sound.

in the drafting room he found tim davis, his best friend, slouched despondently over a 
drawing. tim davis was the tall, blond boy at the next table, whom keating had noticed long 
ago, because he had known, with no tangible evidence, but with certainty, as keating always 
knew such things, that this was the favored draftsman of the office. keating managed to be 
assigned, as frequently as possible, to do parts of the projects on which davis worked. soon 
they were going out to lunch together, and to a quiet little speak-easy after the day's work, and 
keating was listening with breathless attention to davis' talk about his love for one elaine 
duffy, not a word of which keating ever remembered afterward.

he found davis now in black gloom, his mouth chewing furiously a cigarette and a pencil at 
once. keating did not have to question him

"to hell with that! i've got a date with elaine tonight! how'm i going to break it? third time! 
she won't believe me! she told me so last time! that's the end! i'm going up to guy the mighty 
and tell him where he can put his plans and his job! i'm through!"

"wait," said keating, and leaned closer to him. "wait! there's another way. i'll finish them for 
you."

"huh?"

"i'll stay. i'll do them. don't be afraid. no one'll tell the difference."

"pete! would you?"

"sure. i've nothing to do tonight. you just stay till they all go home, then skip."

"oh, gee, pete!" davis sighed, tempted. "but look, if they find out, they'll can me. you're too

"they won't find out."

"i can't lose my job, pete. you know i can't. elaine and i are going to be ma

bending under a solitary green lamp. keating glanced at the desolate expanse of three long 
rooms, oddly silent after the day's rush, and he felt that he owned them, that he would own 

them, as surely as the pencil moved in his hand.

it was half past nine when he finished the plans, stacked them neatly on davis' table, and left 
the office. he walked down the street, glowing with a comfortable, undignified feeling, as 
though after a good meal. then the realization of his loneliness struck him suddenly. he had

fact that no other boy would look at her twice. but he had never been as happy as when he 
took her to fraternity dances. he had had many violent loves, when he swore he could not live 
without this girl or that; he forgot catherine for weeks at a time and she never reminded him. 
he had always come back to her, suddenly, inexplicably, as he did tonight.

her mother, a gentle little schoolteacher, had died last winter. catherine had gone to live with 
an uncle in new york. keating had answered some of her letters immediately, others--months 
later. she had always replied at once, and never written during his long silences, waiting 
patiently. he had felt, when he thought of her, that nothing would ever replace her. then, in 
new york, within reach of a bus or a telephone, he had forgotten her again for a month.

he never thought, as he hurried to her now, that he should have announced his visit. he never 
wondered whether he would find her at home. he had always come bac

"oh, he does, does he?"

"but you don't understand. he means it kindly. it's the way he says things. you'll have a lot in

"who?" said keating.

"my uncle."

"say," keating asked, his voice a little husky, "what's your

uncle's name?"

"ellsworth toohey. why?" his hands fell limply. he sat staring at her. "what's the matter, 
peter?"

he swallowed. she saw the jerking motion of his throat. then he said, his voice hard:

hard day ahead." he

a year with the firm of francon & heyer had given keating the whispered title of crown 
prince without portfolio. still only a draftsman, he was francon's reigning favorite. francon 
took him out to lunch--an unprecedented honor for an employee. francon called him to be 
present at interviews with clients. the clients seemed to like seeing so decorative a young 
man in an architect's office.

lucius n. heyer had the annoying habit of asking francon suddenly: "when did you get the 
new man?" and pointing to an employee who had been there for three year

surprised everybody by remembering keating's name and by greeting him, whenever they 
met, with a smile of positive recognition. keating had had a long conversation with him, one 
dreary november afternoon, on the subject of old porcelain. it was heyer's hobby; he owned a 
famous collection, passionately gathered. keating displayed an earnest knowledge of the 
subject, though he had never heard of old porcelain till the night before, which he had spent at 
the public library. heyer was delighted; nobody in the office cared about his hobby, few ever 

noticed his presence. heyer remarked to his partner: "you're certainly good at picking your 
men, guy. there's one boy i wish we wouldn't lose, what's his name?--keating."

"yes, indeed," francon answered, smiling, "yes, indeed."

in the drafting room, keating conc

e first step in his career.

davis let him do most of his own work; only night work, at first, then parts of his daily 
assignments as well; secretly, at first, then openly. davis had not wanted it to be known. 
keating made it known, with an air of naive confidence which implied that he was only a tool, 
no more than tim's pencil or t-square, that his help enhanced tim's importance rather than 
diminished it and, therefore, he did not wish to conceal it.

at first, davis relayed instructions to keating; then the chief draftsman took the arrangement 
for granted and began coming to keating with orders intended for davis. keating was always 
there, smiling, saying: "i'll do it; don't bother tim with those little things, i'll take care of it." 
davis relaxed and let himself be carried along; he smoked a great deal, he lolled about, his 
legs twisted loosely over the rungs of a stool, his eyes closed, dreaming of elaine; he uttered 
once in a while: "is the stuff ready, pete?"

davis had married

elaine that spring. he was frequently late for work. he had whispered to 
keating: "you're in with the old man, pete, slip a good word for me, once in a while, will you?--
so they'll overlook a few things. god, do i hate to have to be working right now!" keating would 
say to francon: "i'm sorry, mr. francon, that the murray job sub-basement plans were so late, 
but tim davis had a quarrel with his wife last night, and you know how newlyweds are, you 
don't want to be too hard on them," or "it's tim davis again, mr. francon, do forgive him, he 
can't help it, he hasn't got his mind on his work at all!"

when francon glanced at the list of his employees' salaries, he noticed that his most 
expensive draftsman was the man least needed in the office.

n tim davis lost his job, no one in the drafting room was surprised but tim davis. he 
could not understand it. he set his lips defiantly in bitterness against a world he would hate 
forever. he felt he had no friend on earth save peter keating.

keating consoled him, cursed francon, cursed the injustice of humanity, spent six dollars in a 
speak-easy, entertaining the secretary of an obscure architect of his acquaintance and 
arranged a new job for tim davis.

whenever he thought of davis afterward, keating felt a warm pleasure; he had influenced the 
course of a human being, had thrown him off one path and pushed him into another; a human 
being--it was not tim davis to him any longer, it was a living frame and a mind, a conscious

mind--why had he always feared that mysterious entity of consciousness within others?--and 
he had twisted that frame and that mind to his own will. by a unanimous decision of francon, 
heyer and the chief draftsman, tim's table, position and salary were given to peter keating. 
but this was only part of his satisfaction; there was another sense of it, warmer and less real--
and more dangerous. he said brightly and often: 'tim davis? oh yes, i got him his present 
job."

he wrote to his mother about it. she said to her friends: "petey is such an unselfish boy."

he wrote to her dutifully each week; his letters were short and respectful; hers, long, detailed 
and full of advice which he seldom finished reading.

waited for reassurance, not knowing what sort of reassurance he needed nor why it could 
come only from roark. he spoke of his job and he questioned roark, with sincere concern, 
about cameron's office. roark listened to him, answered all his questions willingly, but 
keating felt that he was knocking against a sheet of iron in roark's unmoving eyes, and that 
they were not speaking about the same things at all. before the visit was over, keating was 
taking notice of roark's frayed cuffs, of his shoes, of the patch on the knee of his trousers, 
and he felt satisfied. he went away chuckling, but he went away miserably uneasy, and 
wondered why, and swore never to see roark again, and wondered why he knew that he 
would have to see him.

through the open door of the bathroom he saw francon standing at the washstand, his 
stomach pressed to its shining edge, brushing his teeth.

"that's splendid," said francon, munching through a thick foam of toothpaste. "that'll do just 
as well. don't you see?"

"no."

"lord, pete, i explained it to you yesterday before we started. mrs. dunlop's husband's 
planning to build a home for her."

"oh, yeah," said keating weakly, brushing the matted black curls off his face. "oh, yeah...i 
remember now...jesus, guy, i got a head on me!..."

he remembered vaguely the party to which francon had taken him the night before, he 
remembered the caviar in a hollow iceberg, the black net evening gown and the pretty face of 
mrs. dunlop, but he could not remember how he had come to end up in francon's apartment. 
he shrugged; he had attended many parties with francon in the past year and had often been 
brought here like

 this.

"it's not a very large house," francon was saying, holding the toothbrush in his mouth; it made 
a lump on his cheek and its green handle stuck out. "fifty thousand or so, i understand. 
they're small fry anyway. but mrs. dunlop's brother-in-law is quimby--you know, the big real 
estate fellow. won't hurt to get a little wedge into that family, won't hurt at all. you're to see 
where that commission ends up, pete. can i count on you, pete?"

"sure," said keating, his head drooping. "you can always count on me, guy...."

he sat still, watching his bare toes and thinking of stengel, francon's designer. he did not 
want to think, but his mind leaped to stengel automatically, as it always did, because stengel 
represented his next step.

stengel was impregnable to friendship. for two years, keating's attempts had broken against 
the ice of stengel's glasses. what stengel thought of him was whispered in the drafting 
rooms, but few dared to repeat it save i

n quotes; stengel said it aloud, even though he knew 
that the corrections his sketches bore, when they returned to him from francon's office, were 
made by keating's hand. but stengel had a vulnerable point: he had been planning for some 
time to leave francon and open an office of his own. he had selected a partner, a young 
architect of no talent but of great inherited wealth. stengel was waiting only for a chance. 
keating had thought about this a great deal he could think of nothing else. he thought of it 
again, sitting there on the floor of francon's bedroom.

two days later, when he escorted mrs. dunlop through the gallery exhibiting the paintings

"yes," he said as she stared obediently at a landscape featuring an auto dump and tried to 
compose her face into the look of admiration expected of her; "magnificent work. note the 
colors, mrs. dunlop....they say this fellow mawson had a terribly hard time. it's an old story--
trying to get recognition. old and heartbreaking. it's the same in all the arts. my own 
profession included."

"oh, indeed?" said mrs. dunlop, who quite seemed to prefer architecture at the moment.

"now this," said keating, stopping before the depiction of an old hag picking at her bare toes 
on a street curb, "this is art as a social document. it takes a person of courage to appreciate 
this."

"it's simply wonderful," said mrs. dunlop.

"ah, yes, courage. it's a rare quality....they say mawson was starving in a garret when mrs. 
stuyvesant discovered him. it's glorious to be able to help young talent on its way."

"it must be wonderful," agreed mrs. dunlop.

"if i were rich," said keating wistfully, "i'd make i

"do you know, mr. keating?--my husband and i are planning to build a little home on long 
island."

"oh, are you? how very charming of you, mrs. dunlop, to confess such a thing to me. you're 
so young, if you'll forgive my saying this. don't you know that you run the danger of my 
becoming a nuisance and trying to interest you in my firm? or are you safe and have chosen 
an architect already?"

"no, i'm not safe at all," said mrs. dunlop prettily, "and i wouldn't mind the danger really. i've 
thought a great deal about

courage, mrs. dunlop, they lack courage. stengel is a great artist, but there are so few 
discerning people to see it. he's ready to go on his own, if only he could find some outstanding 
person like mrs. stuyvesant to give him a chance."

"really?" said mrs. dunlop. "how very interesting! tell me more about it."

he told her a great deal more about it. by the time they had finished the inspection of the 
works of frederic mawson, mrs. dunlop was shaking keating's hand and saying:

"it's so kind, so very unusually kind of you. are you sure that it won't embarrass you with your 
office if you arrange for me to meet mr. stengel? i didn't quite dare to suggest it and it was so 
kind of you not to be angry at me. it's so unselfish of you and more than anyone else would 
have done in your position."

when keating approached stengel with the suggestion of a proposed luncheon, the man 
listened to him without a word. then he jerked his head and snapped:

"wha
 
 ___________________________
 
t's in it for you?"

before keating could answer, stengel threw his head back suddenly.

"oh," said stengel. "oh, i see."

then he leaned forward, his mouth drawn thin in contempt:

"okay. i'll go to that lunch."

when stengel left the firm of francon & heyer to open his own office and proceed with the 
construction of the dunlop house, his first commission, guy francon smashed a ruler against 
the edge of his desk and roared to keating:

"the bastard! the abysmal bastard! after all i've done for him."

"what did you expect?" said keating, sprawled in a low armchair before him. "such is life."

"but what beats me is how did that little skunk ever hear of it? to snatch it right from under 
our nose!"

"well, i've never trusted him anyway." keating shrugged. "human nature..."

the bitterness in his voice was sincere. he had received no gratitude from stengel. stengel's 
parting remark to him had been only: "you're a worse bastar

d than i thought you were. good 
luck. you'll be a great architect some day."

thus keating achieved the position of chief designer for francon & heyer.

francon celebrated the occasion with a modest little orgy at one of the quieter and costlier 
restaurants. "in a coupla years," he kept repeating, "in a coupla years you'll see things 
happenin'. pete....you're a good boy and i like you and i'll do things for you....haven't i done 
things for you?...you're going places, pete...in a coupla years...."

"your tie's crooked, guy," said keating dryly, "and you're spilling brandy all over

your vest...."

facing his first task of designing, keating thought of tim davis, of stengel, of many others 
who had wanted it, had struggled for it, had tried, had been beaten--by him. it was a 
triumphant feeling. it was a tangible affirmation of his greatness. then he found himself 
suddenly in his glass-enclosed office, looking down at a blank sheet of paper--alone. 
something rolled in his throat down to his stomach, cold and empty, his old feeling of the 
dropping hole. he leaned against the table, closing his eyes. it had never been quite real t

only a small residence. but instead of seeing it rise before him, he saw it sinking; he 
saw its shape as a pit in the ground; and as a pit within him; as emptiness, with only davis and 
stengel rattling uselessly within it. francon had said to him about the building: "it must have 
dignity, you know, dignity...nothing freaky...a structure of elegance...and stay within the 
budget," which was francon's conception of giving his designer ideas and letting him work 
them out. through a cold stupor, keating thought of the clients laughing in his face; he heard 
the thin, omnipotent voice of ellsworth toohey calling his attention to the opportunities open to 
him in the field of plumbing. he hated every piece of stone on the face of the earth. he hated 
himself for having chosen to be an architect.

when he began to draw, he tried not to think of the job he was doing; he thought only that 
francon had done it, and stengel, even heyer, and all the others, and that he could do it, if 
they could.

he stopped. it did not sound bright and proud, as it would have sounded anywhere else. it 
sounded like begging.

roark turned and looked at him. roark's eyes were not contemptuous; only a little wider than 
usual, attentive and puzzled. he said nothing and turned back to the drawings.

keating felt naked. davis, stengel, francon meant nothing here. people were his protection 
against people. roark had no sense of people. others gave keating a feeling of his own 
value. roark gave him nothing. he thought that he should seize his drawings and run. the 
danger was not roark. the danger was that he, keating, remained. roark turned to him.

"do you enjoy doing this sort of thing, peter?" he asked. "oh, i know," said keating, his voice 
shrill, "i know you don't approve of it, but this is business, i just want to know what you think of 
this practically, not philosophically, not..."

"no, i'm not going to preach to you. i was only wonde

you could help me, howard, if you could just help me with it a little. it's my first house, and it 
means so much to me at the office, and i'm not sure. what do you think? will you help me, 
howard?"

"all right."

roark threw aside the sketch of the graceful facade with the fluted pilasters, the broken 

pediments, the roman fasces over the windows and the two eagles of empire by the 
entrance. he picked up the plans. he took a sheet of tracing paper, threw it over the plan and 
began to draw. keating stood watching the pencil in roark's hand. he saw his imposing 
entrance foyer disappearing, his twisted corridors, his lightless corners; he saw an immense 
living room growing in the space he had thought too limited; a wall of giant windows facing the 
garden, a spacious kitchen. he watched for a long time. "and the facade?" he asked, when 
roark threw the pencil down. "i can't help you with that. if you must have it classic, have it 
good classic at least. you don't need three pilasters wher

atefully, when he was leaving, his drawings under his arm; he 
descended the stairs, hurt and angry; he worked for three days making new plans from 
roark's sketches, and a new, simpler elevation; and he presented his house to francon with a 
proud gesture that looked like a flourish. "well," said francon, studying it, "well, i 
declare!...what an imagination you have, peter...i wonder...it's a bit daring, but i wonder..." he 
coughed and added: "it's just what i had in mind."

"of course," said keating. "i studied your buildings, and i tried to think of what you'd do, and if 
it's good, it's because i think i know how to catch your ideas."

francon smiled. and keating thought suddenly that francon did not really believe it and knew 
that keating did not believe it, and yet they were both contented, bound tighter together by a 
common method and a common guilt.

roark had not found him at home, and had known what was happening, but could only wait, 
hoping for cameron's safe return. then, cameron had lost even the shame of his agony, and 
had come to his office reeling, recognizing no one, openly drunk and flaunting it before the 
walls of the only place on earth he had respected.

roark learned to face his own landlord with the quiet statement that he could not pay him for 
another week; the landlord was afraid of him and did not insist. peter keating heard of it 
somehow, as he always heard everything he wanted to know. he came to roark's unheated 
room, one evening, and sat down, keeping his overcoat on. he produced a wallet, pulled out 
five ten-dollar bills, and handed them to roark. "you need it, howard. i know you need it. 
don't start protesting now. you can pay me back any time." roark looked at him, astonished, 
took the money, saying: "yes, i need it. thank you, peter." then keating said: "what in hell 
are you doing, wasting yours

 but a crusade and a consecration to a joy that justifies the existence of the 
earth." he dropped the clipping into the fire and reached for another folder.

he gathered every stub of pencil from cameron's desk and threw them in also.

he stood over the heater. he did not move, he did not look down; he felt the movement of the 

glow, a faint shudder at the edge of his vision. he looked at the drawing of the skyscraper that 
had never been built, hanging on the wall before him.

it was peter keating's third year with the firm of francon & heyer. he carried his head high, 
his body erect with studied uprightness; he looked like the picture of a successful young man 
in advertisements for high-priced razors or medium-priced cars.

he dressed well and watched people noticing it. he had an apartment off park avenue, 
modest but fashionable, and he bought three valuable etchings as well as a first edition of a 
classic he had never read nor opened since. occasionally, he escorted clients to the

e of a medieval stonecutter, scarlet velvet and tights; he was mentioned in a 
society-page account of the event--the first mention of his name in print--and he saved the 
clipping.

he had forgotten his first building, and the fear and doubt of its birth. he had learned that it 
was so simple. his clients would accept anything, so long as he gave them an imposing 
facade, a majestic entrance and a regal drawing room, with which to astound their guests. it 
worked out to everyone's satisfaction: keating did not care so long as his clients were 
impressed, the clients did not care so long as their guests were impressed, and the guests did 
not care anyway.

mrs. keating rented her house in stanton and came to live with him in new york. he did not 
want her; he could not refuse--because she was his mother and he was not expected to 
refuse. he met her with some eagerness; he could at least impress her by his rise in the 
world. she was not impressed; she inspected his rooms, his clothes, his ban

you've got to watch your prestige before those boys. the little one who brought in those

on him....the one with the long nose is no friend of yours....never mind, i just know....watch

then she asked:

"guy francon...has he any children?"

"one daughter."

"oh..." said mrs. keating. "what is she like?"

"i've never met her."

"really, peter," she said, "it's downright rude to mr. francon if you've made no effort to meet 
his family."

"she's been away at college, mother. i'll meet her some day. it's getting late, mother, and i've 
got a lot of work to do tomorrow...."

but he thought of it that night and the following day. he had thought of it before and often. he 
knew that francon's daughter had graduated from college long ago and was now working on 
the banner, where s

he wrote a small column on home decoration. he had been able to learn 
nothing else about her. no one in the office seemed to know her. francon never spoke of her.

on that following day, at luncheon, keating decided to face the subject.

"i hear such nice things about your daughter," he said to

francon. "where did you hear nice things about her?" francon asked ominously.

"oh, well, you know how it is, one hears things. and she writes brilliantly."

"yes, she writes brilliantly." francon's mouth snapped shut.

"really, guy, i'd love to meet her."

francon looked at him and sighed wearily.

"you know she's not living with me," said francon. "she has an apartment of her own--i'm not 
sure that i ev

say, peter, what did 
mrs. mannering say about that new stairway arrangement?"

keating felt angry, disappointed--and relieved. he looked at francon's squat figure and 
wondered what appearance his daughter must have inherited to earn her father's so obvious 
disfavor. rich and ugly as sin--like most of them, he decided. he thought that this need not 
stop him--some day. he was glad only that the day was postponed. he thought, with new 
eagerness, that he would go to see catherine tonight.

mrs. keating had met catherine in stanton. she had hoped that peter would forget. now she 
knew that he had not forgotten, even though he seldom spoke of catherine and never brought 
her to his home. mrs. keating did not mention catherine by name. but she chatted about 
penniless girls who hooked brilliant young men, about promising boys whose careers had 
been wrecked by marriage to the wrong woman; and she read to him every newspaper 
account of a celebrity divorcing his plebeian wife who could not live u

and knees to reach a lavender envelope lying under a desk.

"now what on earth?" he demanded angrily.

"it's a very important letter," she said, still kneeling, the envelope held tightly in her little fist, 
"it's a very important letter and there it was, practically in the wastebasket, i might have swept 
it out without noticing. it's from a poor widow who has five children and her eldest son wants to 
be an architect and uncle ellsworth is going to arrange a scholarship for him."

"well," said keating, rising, "i've had just about enough of this. let's get out of here, katie. 
let's go for a walk. it's beautiful out tonight. you don't seem to belong to yourself in here."

"oh, fine! let's go for a walk."

outside, there was a mist of snow, a dry, fine, weightless snow that hung still in the air, filling 
the narrow tanks of streets. they walked together, catherine's arm pressed to his, their feet 
leaving long brown smears on the white sidewalks.

they sat down on a bench in washington squar

, palm up, and looked at it: she wore a black woolen glove and her 
fingers were spread out clumsily like a child's; he saw beads of melted snow in the fuzz of the 
glove; they sparkled radiantly once in the light of a car flashing past.

the bulletin of the architects' guild of america carried, in its miscellaneous department, a 
short item announcing henry cameron's retirement. six lines summarized his achievements 
in architecture and misspelled the names of his two best buildings.

peter keating walked into francon's office and interrupted francon's well-bred bargaining with 
an antique dealer over a snuffbox that had belonged to madame pompadour. francon was 
precipitated into paying nine dollars and twenty-five cents more than he had intended to pay. 
he turned to keating testily, after the dealer had left, and asked:

"well, what is it, peter, what is it?"

keating threw the bulletin down on francon's desk, his thumbnail underscoring the paragraph 
about cameron.

"i've got to have

that man," said keating.

"what man?"

"howard roark."

"who the hell," asked francon, "is howard roark?"

"i've told you about him. cameron's designer."

"oh...oh, yes, i believe you did. well, go and get him."

"do you give me a free hand on how i hire him?"

"what the hell? what is there about hiring another draftsman? incidentally, did you have to 
interrupt me for that?"

"he might be difficult. and i want to get him before he decides on anyone else."

"really? he's going to be difficult about it, is he? do you i

er of fact, i was 
one of his best draftsmen myself once, long ago. there's something to be said for old 
cameron when you need that sort of thing. go ahead. get your roark if you think you need

"it's not that i really need him. but he's an old friend of mine, and out of a job, and i thought it 
would be a nice thing to do for him."

"well, do anything you wish. only don't bother me about it....say, peter, don't you think this is 
as lovely a snuffbox as you've ever seen?"

that evening, keating climbed, unannounced, to roark's room and knocked, nervously, and 
entered cheerfully. he found roark sitting on the window sill, smoking.

"just passing by," said keating, "with an evening to kill and happened to think that that's 
where you live, howard, and thought i'd drop in to say hello, haven't seen you for such a long 
time."

"i know what you want," said roark. "all right. how much?"

"what do you mean, howard?"

"you know what i mean."

"sixty-five a week," keating blurted out. this w

new he should take no chances, say 
nothing else and leave. but something inexplicable, beyond all practical considerations, was 
pushing him on. he said unheedingly:

"can't you be human for once in your life?"

"what?"

"human! simple. natural."

"but i am."

"can't you ever relax?"

roark smiled, because he was sitting on the window sill, leaning sloppily against the wall, his 
long legs hanging loosely, the cigarette held without pressure between limp fingers.

"that's not what i mean!" said keating. "why can't you go out for a drink with me?"

"what for?"

"do you always have to have a purpose? do you always have to be so damn serious? can't 
you ever do things without reason, just like everybody else? you're so serious, so old. 
everything's important with you, everything's great, significant in some way, every minute, 
even when you keep still. can't you ever be comfortable--and unimportant?"

"no."

"don't you get tired of the heroic?"

"what's heroic about me?"

"nothing. everything.

involved? what makes you uncomfortable when you feel that--since 
you're so sure i'm wrong?"

"i...i don't know." he added: "i don't know what you're talking about." and then he asked 
suddenly:

"howard, why do you hate me?"

"i don't hate you."

"well, that's it! why don't you hate me at least?"

"why should i?"

"just to give me something. i know you can't like me. you can't like anybody. so it would be 
kinder to acknowledge people's existence by hating them."

"i'm not kind, peter."

and as keating found nothing to say, roark added:

"go home, peter. you got what you wanted. let it go at that. see you monday."

roark stood at a table in the drafting room of francon & heyer, a pencil in his hand, a strand 
of orange hair hanging down over his face, the prescribed pearl-gray smock like a prison 
uniform on his body.

he had learned to accept his new job. the lines he drew were to be the clean lines of steel 
beams, and he tried not to think of what these beams would carry. it was difficul

te real to him.

but he knew that this would not last--he had to wait--it was his only assignment, to wait--what 
he felt didn't matter--it had to be done--he had to wait.

"mr. roark, are you ready with the steel cage for the gothic lantern for the american radio 
corporation building?"

he had no friends in the drafting room. he was there like a piece of furniture, as useful, as 
impersonal and as silent. only the chief of the engineering department, to which roark was 

assigned, had said to keating after the first two weeks: "you've got more sense than i gave 
you credit for, keating. thanks."

"for what?" asked keating. "for nothing that was intentional, i'm sure," said the chief.

once in a while, keating stopped by roark's table to say softly: "will you drop in at my office 
when you're through tonight, howard? nothing important."

when roark came, keating began by saying: "well, how do you like it here, howard? if 
there's anything you want, just say so and i'll..." roark interrupted 
 
 ___________________________
 
to ask: "where is it, this 
time?" keating produced sketches from a drawer and said: "i know it's perfectly right, just as it 
is, but what do you think of it, generally speaking?" roark looked at the sketches, and even 
though he wanted to throw them at keating's face and resign, one thought stopped him: the 
thought that it was a building and that he had to save it, as others could not pass a drowning 
man without leaping in to the rescue.

then he worked for hours, sometimes all night, while keating sat and watched. he forgot 
keating's presence. he saw only a building and his chance to shape it. he knew that the 
shape would be changed, torn, distorted. still, some order and reason would remain in its 
plan. it would be a better building than it would have been if he refused.

sometimes, looking at the sketch of a structure simpler, cleaner, more honest than the others, 
roark would say: "that's not so bad, peter. you're improving." and keating would feel an odd 
little jolt inside, somet

compliments of guy francon, of his clients, of all others. then he would forget it and feel 
much more substantially pleased when a wealthy lady murmured over a teacup: "you're the 
coming architect of america, mr. keating," though she had never seen his buildings.

he found compensations for his submission to roark. he would enter the drafting room in the 
morning, throw a tracing boy's assignment down on roark's table and say: "howard, do this 
up for me, will you?--and make it fast." in the middle of the day, he would send a boy to 
roark's table to say loudly: "mr. keating wishes to see you in his office at once." he would 
come out of the office and walk in roark's direction and say to the room at large: "wh

weeks later, mike stopped roark, one day, at the building, his ugly face puzzled, and asked:

"say, red, i heard the super tell a guy from the contractor's that you're stuck-up and stubborn 
and the lousiest bastard he's ever been up against. what did you do to him?"

"nothing."

"what the hell did he mean?"

"i don't know," said roark. "do you?"

mike looked at him, shrugged and grinned.

"no," said mike.

early in may, peter keating departed for washington, to supervise the construction of a 
museum donated to the city by a great philanthropist easing his conscience. the museum 
building, keating pointed out proudly, was to be decidedly different: it was not a reproduction 
of the parthenon, but of the maison carrée at nîmes.

keating had been away for some time when an office boy approached roark's table and 
informed him that mr. francon wished to see him in his office. when roark entered the 
sanctuary, francon smiled
 
 ___________________________
 
 from behind the desk and said cheerfully: "sit down, my friend. sit 
down...." but something in roark's eyes, which he had never seen at close range before, 
made francon's voice shrink and stop, and he added dryly: "sit down." roark obeyed. 
francon studied him for a second, but could reach no conclusion beyond deciding that the 
man had a most unpleasant face, yet looked quite correctly attentive.

"you're the one who's worked for cameron, aren't you?" francon asked. "yes," said roark.

"mr. keating has been telling me very nice things about you," francon tried pleasantly and 
stopped. it was wasted courtesy; roark just sat looking at him, waiting. "listen...what's your 
name?"

"roark."

"listen, roark. we have a client who is a little...odd, but he's an important man, a very 
important man, and we have to satisfy him. he's given us a commission for an eight-million-
dollar office building, but the trouble is that he has very definite ideas on what he wants it to 
look like. he wants it--

" francon shrugged apologetically, disclaiming all blame for the 
preposterous suggestion--"he wants it to look like this." he handed roark a photograph. it was 
a photograph of the dana building.

roark sat quite still, the photograph hanging between his fingers. "do you know that 
building?" asked francon.

"yes."

"well, that's what he wants. and mr. keating's away. i've had bennett and cooper and 
williams make sketches, but he's turned them down. so i thought i'd give you a chance."

francon looked at him, impressed by the magnanimity of his own offer. there was no 
reaction. there was only a man who still looked as if he'd been struck on the head.

"of course," said francon, "it's quite a jump for you, quite an assignment, but i thought i'd let 
you try. don't be afraid. mr. keating and i will go over it afterward. just draw up the plans and

 was hard, toneless, 
revealing the effort, so that the plea became an insult to the man who was making him plead. 
keating would have given a great deal to see roark in that moment. but francon could not 
appreciate the triumph he was the first ever to achieve; he recognized only the insult.

"am i correct in gathering," francon asked, "that you are criticizing me and teaching me 
something about architecture?"

"i'm begging you," said roark, closing his eyes. "if you weren't a protégé of mr. keating's, i 
wouldn't bother to discuss the matter with you any further. but since you are quite obviously 
naive and inexperienced, i shall point out to you that i am not in the habit of asking for the 
esthetic opinions of my draftsmen. you will kindly take this photograph--and i do not wish any 
building as cameron might have designed it, i wish the scheme of this adapted to our site--
and you will follow my instructions as to the classic treatment of the facade."

"i can't do it," said roark, very

arded most of francon's biggest jobs. mike had expected to see roark 
on an inspection visit to the factory that afternoon, and greeted him angrily:

"what's the matter, red? lying down on the job?"

when he heard the news, mike sat still and looked like a bulldog baring its teeth. then he 
swore savagely.

"the bastards," he gulped between stronger names, "the bastards..."

"keep still, mike."

"well...what now, red?"

"someone else of the same kind, until the same thing happens again."

when keating returned from washington he went straight up to francon's office. he had not 
stopped in the drafting room and had heard no news. francon greeted him expansively:

"boy, it's great to see you back! what'll you have? a whisky-and-soda or a little brandy?"

"no, thanks. just give me a cigarette."

"here....boy, you look fine! better than ever. how do you do it, you lucky bastard? i have so 
many things to tell you! how did it go down in washington? everything all right?" and before 
keating could

never seen an austrian village--the philanthropist!--and plasters the photos all over his papers 
with plenty of sob stuff about educational values, and gets mush notes from women's clubs! 
i'd like to know what he'll do with the village when he gets rid of lili! he will, you know, they 
never last long with him. do you think i'll have a chance with her then?"

"sure," said keating. "sure, you will. how's everything here in the office?"

bad for his heart, and a hundred dollars a case!...besides, lucius got himself caught in a

us from a scandal....oh, by the way, i fired that friend of yours, what

"oh," said keating, and let a moment pass, then asked:

"why?"

"the insolent bastard! where did you ever pick him up?"

"what happened?"

"i thought i'd be nice to him, give him a real break. i asked him to make a sketch for the 
farrell building--you know, the one brent finally managed to design and we got farrell to 
accept, you know, the simplified doric--and your friend just up and refused to do it. it seems 
he has ideals or something. so i showed him the gate....what's the matter? what are you 
smiling at?

"nothing. i can just see it."

"now don't you ask me to take him back!"

"no, of course not."

for several days, keating thought that he should call on roark. he did not know what he 
would say, but felt dimly that he should say something. he kept postponing it. he was gaining 
assurance in his work. he felt that he did not need roark, after all. the days went by, and he 
did not call on roark, and he felt relief in being free to forget him.

beyond the windows of his room roark saw the roofs, the water tanks, the chimneys, the cars 
speeding far below. there was a threat in the silence of his room, in the empty

not known to anyone, however, save to guy francon and a very few others, that gail wynand 
owned the corporation which owned the corporation which owned the noyes-belmont hotel.

this added greatly to francon's discomfort. gail wynand's real-estate operations were 
rumored to be vaster than his journalistic empire. it was the first chance francon had ever had 
at a wynand commission and he grasped it avidly, thinking of the possibilities which it could 
open. he and keating had put their best efforts into designing the most ornate of all rococo 
palaces for future patrons who could pay twenty-five dollars per day per room and who were 
fond of plaster flowers, marble cupids and open elevator cages of bronze lace. the strike had 
shattered the future possibilities; francon could not be blamed for it, but one could never tell 
whom gail wynand would blame and for what reason. the unpredictable, unaccountable 
shifts of wynand's favor were famous, and it was well kno

wn that few architects he employed 
once were ever employed by him again.

francon's sullen mood led him to the unprecedented breach of snapping over nothing in 
particular at the one person who had always been immune from it--peter keating. keating 
shrugged, and turned his back to him in silent insolence. then keating wandered aimlessly 
through the halls, snarling at young draftsmen without provocation. he bumped into lucius n. 
heyer in a doorway and snapped: "look where you're going!" heyer stared after him, 
bewildered, blinking.

there was little to do in the office, nothing to say and everyone to avoid. keating left early and 
walked home through a cold december twilight.

at home, he cursed aloud the thick smell of paint from the overheated radiators. he cursed

ion. he made no secret of his 
sympathy with the strikers, but he had said nothing in his column, for no one could say what 
he pleased on the papers owned by gail wynand save gail wynand. however, a mass 
meeting of strike sympathizers had been called for this evening. many famous men were to 
speak, ellsworth toohey among them. at least, toohey's name had been announced.

the event caused a great deal of curious speculation and bets were made on whether toohey 
would dare to appear. "he will," keating had heard a draftsman insist vehemently, "he'll 
sacrifice himself. he's that kind. he's the only honest man in print."

"he won't," another had said. "do you realize what it means to pull a stunt like that on 
wynand? once wynand gets it in for a man, he'll break the guy for sure as hell's fire. nobody 
knows when he'll do it or how he'll do it, but he'll do it, and nobody'll prove a thing on him, and 
you're done for once you get wynand after you." keating did not care about the issue one way

or another, and the whole matter annoyed him.

he ate his dinner, that evening, in grim silence and when mrs. keating began, with an "oh, by 
the way..." to lead the conversation in a direction he recognized, he snapped: "you're not 
going to talk about catherine. keep still." mrs. keating said nothing further and concentrated 
on forcing more food on his plate.

he took a taxi to greenwich village. he hurried up the stairs. he jerked at the bell. he waited. 
there was no answer. he stood, leaning against the wall, ringing, for a long time. catherine 
wouldn't be out when she knew he was coming; she couldn't be. he walked incredulously 
down the stairs, out to the street, and looked up at the windows of her apartment. the 
windows were dark.

he stood, looking up at the windows a

icly to make a martyr of himself tonight. that's where she went, he thought, the damn little 
fool! he said aloud: "to hell with her!"...and he was walking rapidly in the direction of the 
meeting hall.

there was one naked bulb of light over the square frame of the hall's entrance, a small, blue-
white lump glowing ominously, too cold and too bright. it leaped out of the dark street, lighting 
one thin trickle of rain from some ledge above, a glistening needle of glass, so thin and 
smooth that keating thought crazily of stories where men had been killed by being pierced 
with an icicle. a few curious loafers stood indifferently in the rain around the entrance, and a 
few policemen. the door was open. the dim lobby was crowded with people who could not 
get into the packed hall, they were listening to a loud-speaker installed there for the occasion. 
at the door three vague shadows were handing out pamphlets to passers-by. one of the 
shadows was a consumptive, unshaved young man with a long,

 bare neck; the other was a 
trim youth with a fur collar on an expensive coat; the third was catherine halsey.

she stood in the rain, slumped, her stomach jutting forward in weariness, her nose shiny, her 
eyes bright with excitement. keating stopped, staring at her.

her hand shot toward him mechanically with a pamphlet, then she raised her eyes and saw 
him. she smiled without astonishment and said happily:

"why, peter! how sweet of you to come here!"

"katie..." he choked a little. "katie, what the hell..."

"but i had to, peter." her voice had no trace of apology. "you don't understand, but i..."

"get out of the rain. get inside."

"but i can't! i have to..."

"get out of the rain at least, you fool!" he pushed her roughly th

ccept them. the freedom to agree or disagree is the 
foundation of our kind of society--and the freedom to strike is a part of it. i am mentioning this 
as a reminder to a certain petronius from hell's kitchen, an exquisite bastard who has been 
rather noisy lately about telling us that this strike represents a destruction of law and order."

the loud-speaker coughed out a high, shrill sound of approval and a clatter of applause. 
there were gasps among the people in the lobby. catherine grasped keating's arm. "oh, 

peter!" she whispered. "he means wynand! wynand was born in hell's kitchen. he can 
afford to say that, but wynand will take it out on uncle ellsworth!"

keating could not listen to the rest of heller's speech, because his head was swimming in so 
violent an ache that the sounds hurt his eyes and he had to keep his eyelids shut tightly. he 
leaned against the wall.

he opened his eyes with a jerk, when he became aware of the peculiar silence around him. 
he had not noticed the en

d of heller's speech. he saw the people in the lobby standing in 
tense, solemn expectation, and the blank rasping of the loud-speaker pulled every glance into 
its dark funnel. then a voice came through the silence, loudly and slowly:

"ladies and gentlemen, i have the great honor of presenting to you now mr. ellsworth 
monkton toohey!"

well, thought keating, bennett's won his six bits down at the office. there were a few seconds 
of silence. then the thing which happened hit keating on the back of the head; it was not a 
sound nor a blow, it was something that ripped time apart, that cut the moment from the 
normal one preceding it. he knew only the shock, at first; a distinct, conscious second was 
gone before he realized what it was and that it was applause. it was such a crash of applause 
that he waited for the loud-speaker to explode; it went on and on and on, pressing against the 
walls of the lobby, and he thought he could feel the walls buckling out to the street.

the future. history, my friends, does not ask questions or acquiescence. it is irrevocable, as 
the voice of the masses that determine it. let us listen to the call. let us organize, my 
brothers. let us organize. let us organize. let us organize."

keating looked at catherine. there was no catherine; there was only a white face dissolving 
in the sounds of the loudspeaker. it was not that she heard her uncle; keating could feel no 
jealousy of him; he wished he could. it was not affection. it was something cold and 
impersonal that left her empty, her will surrendered and no human will holding hers, but a 
nameless thing in which she was being swallowed.

"let's get out of here," he whispered. his voice was savage. he was afraid.

she turned to him, as if she were emerging from unconsciousness. he knew that she was 
trying to recognize him and everything he implied. she whispered: "yes. let's get out." they

walked through the streets, through the rain, without direction. it was cold, but they went on, to 
move, to feel the movement, to know the sensation of their own muscles moving.

"we're getting drenched," keating said at last, as bluntly and naturally as he could; their 
silence frightened him; it proved that they both knew the same thing and that the thing had 
been real. "let's find some place where we can have a drink."

"yes," said catherine, "let's. it's so cold....isn't it stupid of me? now i've missed uncle's 
speech and i wanted so much to hear it." it was all right. she had mentioned it. she had 
mentioned it quite naturally, with a healthy amount of proper regret. the thing was gone. "but i

anted to be with you, peter...i want to be with you always." the thing gave a last jerk, not in 
the meaning of what she said, but in the reason that had prompted her to say it. then it was 
gone, and keating smiled; his fingers sought her bare wrist between her sleeve and glove, 
and her skin was warm against his....

many days later keating heard the story that was being told all over town. it was said that on 
the day after the mass meeting gail wynand had given ellsworth toohey a raise in salary. 
toohey had been furious and had tried to refuse it. "you cannot bribe me, mr. wynand," he 
said. "i'm not bribing you," wynand had answered; "don't flatter yourself."

when the strike was settled, interrupted construction went forward with a spurt throughout the 
city, and keating found himself spending days and nights at work, with

new commissions 
pouring into the office. francon smiled happily at everybody and gave a small party for his 
staff, to erase the memory of anything he might have said. the palatial residence of mr. and 
mrs. dale ainsworth on riverside drive, a pet project of keating's, done in late renaissance 
and gray granite, was complete at last. mr. and mrs. dale ainsworth gave a formal reception 
as a housewarming, to which guy francon and peter keating were invited, but lucius n. 
heyer was ignored, quite accidentally, as always happened to him of late. francon enjoyed 
the reception, because every square foot of granite in the house reminded him of the 
stupendous payment received by a certain granite quarry in connecticut. keating enjoyed the 
reception, because the stately mrs. ainsworth said to him with a disarming smile: "but i was 
certain that you were mr. francon's partner! it's francon and heyer, of course! how perfectly 
careless of
 
 ___________________________
 
 me! all i can offer by way of excuse is that if you aren't his partner, one would 
certainly say you were entitled to be!" life in the office rolled on smoothly, in one of those 
periods when everything seemed to go well.

keating was astonished, therefore, one morning shortly after the ainsworth reception, to see 
francon arrive at the office with a countenance of nervous irritation. "oh, nothing," he waved 
his hand at keating impatiently, "nothing at all." in the drafting room keating noticed three 
draftsmen, their heads close together, bent over a section of the new york banner, reading 
with a guilty kind of avid interest; he heard an unpleasant chuckle from one of them. when 
they saw him the paper disappeared, too quickly. he had no time to inquire into this; a 
contractor's job runner was waiting for him in his office, also a stack of mail and drawings to 
be approved.

he had forgotten the incident three hours later in a rush of appointments. he felt light, clear-

exorbitant--and strangely elegant. she let the fingertips of one hand rest on the railing, a 
narrow hand ending the straight imperious line of her arm. she had gray eyes that were not 
ovals, but two long, rectangular cuts edged by parallel lines of lashes; she had an air of cold 

serenity and an exquisitely vicious mouth. her face, her pale gold hair, her suit seemed to 
have no color, but only a hint, just on the verge of the reality of color, making the full reality 
seem vulgar. keating stood still, because he understood for the first time what it was that 
artists spoke about when they spoke of beauty.

"i'll see him now, if i see him at all," she was saying to the reception clerk. "he asked me to 
come and this is the only time i have." it was not a command; she spoke as if it were not 
necessary for her voice to assume the tones of commanding.

"yes, but..." a light buzzed on the clerk's switchboard; she plugged the connection through, 
hastily. "yes, mr. francon..." she li

stened and nodded with relief. "yes, mr. francon." she 
turned to the visitor: "will you go right in, please?"

the young woman turned and looked at keating as she passed him on her way to the stairs. 
her eyes went past him without stopping. something ebbed from his stunned admiration. he 
had had time to see her eyes; they seemed weary and a little contemptuous, but they left him 
with a sense of cold cruelty.

he heard her walking up the stairs, and the feeling vanished, but the admiration remained. he 
approached the reception clerk eagerly.

"who was that?" he asked.

the clerk shrugged:

"that's the boss's little girl."

"why, the lucky stiff

!" said keating. "he's been holding out on me."

"you misunderstood me," the clerk said coldly. "it's his daughter. it's dominique francon."

"oh," said keating. "oh, lord!"

"yeah?" the girl looked at him sarcastically. "have you read this morning's banner?"

"no. why?"

"read it."

her switchboard buzzed and she turned away from him.

he sent a boy for a copy of the banner, and turned anxiously to the column, "your house," by 
dominique francon. he had heard that she'd been quite successful lately with descriptions of 
the homes of prominent new yorkers. her field was confined to home decoration, but she 
ventured occasionally into architectural crit

e and started for francon's office to ask his 
approval of the sketches, which he did not need.

on the stair landing outside francon's closed door he stopped. he heard francon's voice 
behind the door, loud, angry and helpless, the voice he always heard when francon was 
beaten.

"...to expect such an outrage! from my own daughter! i'm used to anything from you, but this 
beats it all. what am i going to do? how am i going to explain? do you have any kind of a 
vague idea of my position?"

then keating heard her laughing; it was a sound so gay and so cold that he knew it was best 
not to go in. he knew he did not want to go in, because he was afraid again, as he had been 
when he'd seen her eyes.

he turned and descended the stairs. when he had reached the floor below, he was thinking 
that he would meet her, that he would meet her soon and that francon would not be able to 
prevent it now. he thought of it eagerly, laughing in relief at the picture of francon's daughter

in a chewing-gum empire left to an only daughter.

ralston holcombe was now sixty-five, to which he added a few years, for the sake of his 
friends' compliments on his wonderful physique; mrs. ralston holcombe was forty-two, from 
which she deducted considerably.

mrs. ralston holcombe maintained a salon that met informally every sunday afternoon. 
"everybody who is anybody in architecture drops in on us," she told her friends. "they'd 
better," she added.

on a sunday afternoon in march, keating drove to the holcombe mansion--a reproduction of 
a florentine palazzo--dutifully, but a little reluctantly. he had been a frequent guest at these 
celebrated gatherings and he was beginning to be bored, for he knew everybody he could 
expect to find there. he felt, however, that he had to attend this time, because the occasion 
was to be in honor of the completion of one more capitol by ralston holcombe in some state 
or another.

a substantial crowd was lost in the marble ballroom of the holc

too insistently and commented on his remarks by winking and saying: "why, peter, how

however, this afternoon as usual, and she smiled from behind the silver teapot. she wore a 
regal gown of emerald velvet, and a magenta ribbon in her bobbed hair with a cute little bow in 
front. her skin was tanned and dry, with enlarged pores showing on her nostrils. she handed 
a cup to keating, a square-cut emerald glittering on her finger in the candlelight.

keating expressed his admiration for the capitol and escaped to examine the model. he stood 
before it for a correct number of minutes, scalding his lips with the hot liquid that smelled of 
cloves. holcombe, who never looked in the direction of the model and never missed a guest 
stopping before it, slapped keating's shoulder and said something appropriate about young 
fellows learning the beauty of the style of the renaissanc

e. then keating wandered off, shook 
a few hands without enthusiasm, and glanced at his wrist watch, calculating the time when it 
would be permissible to leave. then he stopped.

beyond a broad arch, in a small library, with three young men beside her, he saw dominique 
francon.

she stood leaning against a column, a cocktail glass in her hand. she wore a suit of black 
velvet; the heavy cloth, which transmitted no light rays, held her anchored to reality by 
stopping the light that flowed too freely through

the flesh of her hands, her neck, her face. a 
white spark of fire flashed like a cold metallic cross in the glass she held, as if it were a lens 
gathering the diffused radiance of her skin.

keating tore forward and found francon in the crowd. "well, peter!" said francon brightly. 
"want me to get you a drink? not so hot," he added, lowering his voice, "but the manhattans 
aren't too bad."

"no," said keating, "thanks."

"entre nous," said francon, winking at the model of the capitol, "it's a holy mess, isn't it?"

"yes," said keating. "miserable proportions....that dome looks like holcombe's face imitating 
a sunrise on the roof...." they had stopped in full view of the library and keating's eyes were 
fixed on the girl in black, inviting francon to notice it; he enjoyed having francon in a trap.

"and the plan! the plan! do you see that on the second floor...oh," said francon, noticing.

he looked
 
 ___________________________
 
 at keating, then at the library, then at keating again.

"well," said francon at last, "don't blame me afterward. you've asked for it. come on."

they entered the library together. keating stopped, correctly, but allowing his eyes an 
improper intensity, while francon beamed with unconvincing cheeriness:

"dominique, my dear! may i present?--this is peter keating, my own right hand. peter--my 
daughter."

"how do you do," said keating, his voice soft.

dominique bowed gravely.

"i have waited to meet you for such a long time, miss francon."

"this will be interesting," said dominique. "you will want to be nice to me, of course, and yet 
that won't be diplomatic."

"what do you mean, miss francon?"

"father would prefer you to be horrible with me. father and i don't get along at all."

"why, miss francon, i..."

"i think it's only fair to tell you this at the beginning. you may want to redraw some 
conclusions." he was lookin

g for francon, but francon had vanished. "no," she said softly, 

"father doesn't do these things well at all. he's too obvious. you asked him for the 
introduction, but he shouldn't have let me notice that. however, it's quite all right, since we 
both admit it. sit down."

she slipped into a chair and he sat down obediently beside her. the young men whom he did 
not know stood about for a few minutes, trying to be included in the conversation by smiling 
blankly, then wandered off. keating thought with relief that there was nothing frightening about 
her; there was only a disquieting contrast between her words and the candid innocence of the 
manner she used to utter them; he did not know which to trust.

"i admit i asked for the introduction," he said. "that's obvious anyway, isn't it? who wouldn't 
ask for it? but don't you think that the conclusions i'll draw may have nothing to do with your 
father?"

"don't say that i'm beautiful and exquisite and like no one you've ever met

old me that you liked me. then i would have 
had a better chance of its being true."

she laughed.

"if you understand that," she said, "then we'll get along beautifully. then it might even be true."

gordon l. prescott appeared in the arch of the ballroom, glass in hand. he wore a gray suit 
and a turtle-neck sweater of silver wool. his boyish face looked freshly scrubbed, and he had 
his usual air of soap, tooth paste and the outdoors.

"dominique, darling!" he cried, waving his glass. "hello, keating," he added curtly. 
"dominique, where have you been hiding yourself? i heard you were here and i've had a hell 
of a time looking for you!"

"hello, gordon," she said. she said it quite correctly; there was nothing offensive in the quiet 
politeness of her voice; but following his high note of enthusiasm, her voice struck a tone that 
seemed flat and deadly in its indifference--as if the two sounds mingled into an audible 
counterpoint around the melodic thread of her contempt.

prescott had n

"what?"

"seventh time that you've said it when meeting me, gordon. i'm counting them."

"you simply won't be serious, dominique. you'll never be serious."

"oh, yes, gordon. i was just having a very serious conversation here with my friend peter 
keating."

a lady waved to prescott and he accepted the opportunity, escaping, looking very foolish. and 
keating delighted in the thought that she had dismissed another man for a conversation she 
wished to continue with her friend peter keating.

but when he turned to her, she asked sweetly: "what was it we were talking about, mr. 
keating?" and then she was staring with too great an interest across the room, at the wizened 
figure of a little man coughing over a whisky glass. "why," said keating, "we were..."

"oh, there's eugene pettingill. my great favorite. i must say hello to eugene."

and she was up, moving across the room, her body leaning back as she walked, moving 
toward the most unattractive septuagenarian present.

"you know, peter, i was surprised. i watched you, and you had quite a long chat with her. 
that's amazing. i fully expected her to chase you away with one nice, poisonous crack. maybe 
you could get along with her, after all. i've concluded that you just can't tell anything about her. 
maybe...you know, peter, what i wanted to tell you is this: don't pay any attention to what she 
said about my wanting you to be horrible with her."

the heavy earnestness of that sentence was such a hint that keating's lips moved to shape a 
soft whistle, but he caught himself in time. francon added heavily: "i don't want you to be 
horrible with her at all."

"you know, guy," said keating, in a tone of patronizing reproach, "you shouldn't have run 
away like that."

"i never know how to speak to her." he sighed. "i've never learned to. i can't understand what

"you don't think so?"

"no."

"maybe you're the man to handle her. i don't regret your meeting her now, and you know that i 
didn't want you to. yes, i think you're the one man who could handle her. you...you're quite 
determined--aren't you, peter?--when you're after something?"

"well," said keating, throwing one hand up in a careless gesture, "i'm not afraid very often."

then he leaned back against the cushions, as if he were tired, as if he had heard nothing of 
importance, and he kept silent for the rest of the drive. francon kept silent also.

"don't expect anyone else in the profession to take you in, after they hear what you've done to

"i don't expect that either."

for a few days snyte thought of suing roark and heller. but he decided against it, because 

there was no precedent to follow under the circumstances: because heller had paid him for 
his efforts, and the house had been actually designed by roark; and because no one ever 
sued austen heller. the first visitor to roark's office was peter keating. he walked in, without 
warning, one noon, walked straight across the room and sat down on roark's desk, smiling 
gaily, spreading his arms wide in a sweeping gesture: "well, howard!" he said. "well, fancy 
that!" he had not seen roark for a year. "hello, peter," said roark.

"your own office, your own name and everything! already! just imagine!"

"who told you, peter?"

"oh, one hears things. you wouldn't expect me not to keep track of your career, now would 
you? you know what i've always tho

 the owner will get good and sick of it and he'll come running home to a good 
old early colonial."

the heller house acquired fame throughout the countryside surrounding it. people drove out 
of their way to park on the road before it, to stare, point and giggle. gas-station attendants 
snickered when heller's car drove past. heller's cook had to endure the derisive glances of 
shopkeepers when she went on her errands. the heller house was known in the 
neighborhood as "the booby hatch."

peter keating told his friends in the profession, with an indulgent smile: "now, now, you 
shouldn't say that about him. i've known howard roark for a long time, and he's got quite a 
talent, quite. he's even worked for me once. he's just gone haywire on that house. he'll learn. 
he has a future....oh, you don't think he has? you really don't think he has?"

ellsworth m. toohey, who let no stone spring from the ground of america without his 
comment, did not know that the heller house had been erected, as fa

ved it for him when so much else of greater import had been lost. he did not 
know why he had to see that moment again whenever he felt bitterness for his daughter, nor 
why, seeing it, he felt that unbearable twinge of tenderness. he told himself merely that his 
paternal affection was asserting itself quite against his will. but in an awkward, unthinking way 
he wanted to help her, not knowing, not wanting to know what she had to be helped against.

so he began to look more frequently at peter keating. he began to accept the solution which 
he never quite admitted to himself. he found comfort in the person of peter keating, and he 
felt that keating's simple, stable wholesomeness was just the support needed by the 
unhealthy inconstancy of his daughter.

keating would not admit that he had tried to see dominique again, persistently and without 
results. he had obtained her telephone number from francon long ago, and he had called her 
often. she had answered, and laughed gaily, and told him 
 
 ___________________________
 
that of course she'd see him, she 
knew she wouldn't be able to escape it, but she was so busy for weeks to come and would he 
give her a ring by the first of next month?

francon guessed it. he told keating he would ask dominique to lunch and bring them 
together again. "that is," he added, "i'll try to ask her. she'll refuse, of course." dominique 
surprised him again: she accepted, promptly and cheerfully.

she met them at a restaurant, and she smiled as if this were a reunion she welcomed. she 
talked gaily, and keating felt enchanted, at ease, wondering why he had ever feared her. at 
the end of a half hour she looked at francon and said:

"it was wonderful of you to take time off to see me, f

ok of consternation. "my god, dominique, that reminds me!"

"you have an appointment you forgot?" she asked gently. "confound it, yes! it slipped my 
mind entirely. old andrew colson phoned this morning and i forgot to make a note of it and he 
insisted on seeing me at two o'clock, you know how it is, i just simply can't refuse to see 
andrew colson, confound it!--today of all..." he added, suspiciously: "how did you know it?"

"why, i didn't know it at all. it's perfectly all right, father. mr. keating and i will excuse you, 
and we'll have a lovely luncheon together, and i have no appointments at all for the day, so 
you don't have to be afraid that i'll escape from him."

francon wondered whether she knew that that had been the excuse he'd prepared in advance 
in order to leave her alone with keating. he could not be sure. she was looking straight at 
him; her eyes seemed just a bit too candid. he was glad to escape.

dominique turned to keating with a glance so gentle that it could mean no
 
 ___________________________
 
he watched the way she crossed her legs, a gesture 
smooth and exact, like an expensive instrument being folded; and he could not escape the 
feeling of incredulous admiration he had experienced when he had seen her for the first time. 
when they were leaving, she said:

"will you take me to the theater tonight, peter? i don't care what play, any one of them. call 
for me after dinner. tell father about it. it will please him."

"though, of course, he should know better than to be pleased," said keating, "and so should i, 
but i'll be delighted just the same, dominique."

"why should you know better?"

"because you have no desire to go to a theater or to see me tonight."

"none whatever. i'm beginning to like you, peter. call for me at half past eight."

when keating returned to the office, francon called him upstairs at once.

"well?" francon asked anxiously.

"what's the matter, guy?" said keating, his voice innocent. "why are you so concerned?"

"well, i...i'm just...frankly, i'm interested

peter, and i think that's abnormal. it's unnatural at her age, with her looks, with the kind of 
utterly unrestricted existence that she leads. i wish to god she'd get married. i honestly 
do....well, now, don't repeat that, of course, and don't misinterpret it, i didn't mean it as an 
invitation."

"of course not."

"by the way, peter, the hospital called while you were out. they said poor lucius is much 
better. they think he'll pull through." lucius n. heyer had had a stroke, and keating had 

exhibited a great deal of concern for his progress, but had not gone to visit him at the hospital.

"i'm so glad," said keating.

"but i don't think he'll ever be able to come back to work. he's getting old, peter....yes, he's 
getting old....one reaches an age when one can't be burdened with business any longer." he 
let a paper knife hang between two fingers and tapped it pensively against the edge of a desk 
calendar. "it happens to all of us, peter, sooner or later....one must look a

 now. he had just returned from an evening spent with 
her on a round of night clubs. she always accepted his invitations. he wondered whether her 
attitude was a deliberate proof that she could ignore him more completely by seeing him often 
than by refusing to see him. but each time he met her, he planned eagerly for the next 
meeting. he had not seen catherine for a month. she was busy with research work which her 
uncle had entrusted to her, in preparation for a series of his lectures.

mrs. keating sat under a lamp, mending a slight tear in the lining of peter's dinner jacket, 
reproaching him, between questions, for sitting on the floor in his dress trousers and best 
formal shirt. he paid no attention to the reproaches or the questions. but under his bored 
annoyance he felt an odd sense of relief; as if the stubborn stream of her words were pushing 
him on and justifying him. he answered once in a while: "yes....no....i don't know....oh, yes, 
she's lovely. she's very lovely....it's aw

fully late, mother. i'm tired. i think i'll go to bed...." the 
doorbell rang.

"well," said mrs. keating. "what can that be, at this hour?" keating rose, shrugging, and 
ambled to the door. it was catherine. she stood, her two hands clasped on a large, old, 
shapeless pocketbook. she looked determined and hesitant at once. she drew back a little. 
she said: "good evening, peter. can i come in? i've got to speak to you."

"katie! of course! how nice of you! come right in. mother, it's katie."

mrs. keating looked at the girl's feet which stepped as if moving on the rolling deck of a ship; 
she looked at her son, and she knew that something 
 
 ___________________________
 
had happened, to be handled with great 
caution.

"good evening, catherine," she said softly.

keating was conscious of nothing save the sudden stab of joy he had felt on seeing her; the 
joy told him that nothing had changed, that he was safe in certainty, that her presence 
resolved all doubts. he forgot to wonder about the lateness of the hour, about her first, 
uninvited appearance in his apartment.

"good evening, mrs. keating," she said, her voice bright and hollow. "i hope i'm not disturbing 
you, it's late probably, is it?"

"why, not at all, child," said mrs. keating.

catherine hurried to speak, senselessly, hanging on to the sound of words:

"i'll just take my hat off....where can i put it, mrs. keating? here on the table? would that be 
all right?...no, maybe i'd better put it on this bureau, though it's a little damp from the street, 
the hat is, it might hurt the varnish, it's a nice bureau, i hope it doesn'

t hurt the varnish...."

"what's the matter, katie?" keating asked, noticing at last.

she looked at him and he saw that her eyes were terrified. her lips parted; she was trying to 
smile. "katie!" he gasped. she said nothing. "take your coat off. come here, get yourself 

warm by the fire."

he pushed a low bench to the fireplace, he made her sit down. she was wearing a black 
sweater and an old black skirt, school-girlish house garments which she had not changed for 
her visit. she sat hunched, her knees drawn tight together. she said, her voice lower

 and 
more natural, with the first released sound of pain in it:

"you have such a nice place....so warm and roomy....can you open the windows any time you 
want to?"

"katie darling," he said gently, "what happened?"

"nothing. it's not that anything really happened. only i had to speak to you. now. tonight."

he looked at mrs. keating. "if you'd rather..."

"no. it's perfectly all right. mrs. keating can hear it. maybe it's better if she hears it." she 
turned to his mother and said very simply: "you see, mrs. keating, peter and i are engaged." 
she turned to him and added, her voice breaking: "peter, i want to be married now, tomorrow, 
as soon as possible."

mrs. keating's hand descended slowly to her lap. she looked at catherine, her eyes 
expressionless. she said quietly, with a dignity keating had never expected of her:

"i didn't know it, i am very happy, my dear."

"you don't mind? y

life!...that was all, peter. i can't understand it, but i'm afraid. not so much any more, not here 
with you, but i'm afraid...." mrs. keating spoke, her voice dry and crisp: "why, it's plain what 
happened to you, my dear. you worked too hard and overdid it, and you just got a mite 
hysterical."

"yes...probably..."

"no," said keating dully, "no, it wasn't that...." he was thinking of the loud-speaker in the lobby 
of the strike meeting. then he added quickly: "yes, mother's right. you're killing yourself with 
work, katie. that uncle of yours--i'll wring his neck one of these days."

"oh, but it's not his fault! he doesn't want me

"let's, peter," she whispered. "you really don't mind? i have no real reasons, but i want it. i 
want it so much. then i'll know that everything's all right. we'll manage. i can get a job if 
you...if you're not quite ready or..."

"oh, nonsense. don't talk about that. we'll manage. it doesn't matter. only let's get married 
and everything else will take care of itself."

"darling, you understand? you do understand?"

"yes, katie."

"now that it's all settled," said mrs. keating, "i'll fix you a cup of hot tea, catherine. you'll need 
it before you go home." she prepared the tea, and catherine drank it gratefully and said, 
smiling:

"i...i've often been afraid that you wouldn't approve, mrs. keating."

"whatever gave you that idea," mrs. keating drawled, her voice not in the tone of a question. 
"now you run on home like a good girl and get a good night's sleep."

"mother, couldn't katie stay here tonight? she could sleep with you."

"oh, no, of course not. i'll be perfectly all right, peter. i'll go home."

"not if you..."

"i'm not afraid. not now. i'm fine. you don't think that i'm really scared of uncle ellsworth?"

"well, all right. but don't go yet."

"now, peter," said mrs. keating, "you don't want her to be running around the streets later 
than she has to."

"i'll take her home."

"no," said catherine. "i don't want to be sillier than i am. no, i won't let you."

he kissed her at the door and he said: "i'll come for you at ten o'clock tomorrow morning and 
we'll go for the license."

"yes, peter," she whispered.

he closed the door after her and he stood for a moment, not noticing that he was clenching 
his fists. then he walked defiantly back to the living room, and he
 
 ___________________________
 
 stopped, his hands in his 
pockets, facing his mother. he looked at her, his glance a silent demand. mrs. keating sat 
looking at him quietly, without pretending to ignore the glance and without answering it.

then she asked:

"do you want to go to bed, peter?"

he had expected anything but that. he felt a violent impulse to seize the chance, to turn, leave 
the room and escape. but he had to learn what she thought; he had to justify himself.

"now, mother, i'm not going to listen to any objections."

"i've made no objections," said mrs. keating.

"mother, i want you to understand that i love katie, that n

 that. but as far as i'm concerned, if you think 
that i'm worried about myself--well, you're just blind, peter. don't you see that for me 
personally it would be a perfect match? because i'd have no trouble with catherine, i could 
get along with her beautifully, she'd be respectful and obedient to her mother-in-law. while, on 
the other hand, miss francon..."

he winced. he had known that this would come. it was the one subject he had been afraid to 
hear mentioned.

"oh yes, peter," said mrs. keating quietly, firmly, "we've got to speak of that. now, i'm sure i 
could never manage miss francon, and an elegant society girl like that wouldn't even stand 
for a dowdy, uneducated mother like me. she'd probably edge me out of the house. oh, yes, 
peter. but you see, it's not me that i'm thinking of."

"mother," he said harshly, "that part of it is pure drivel--about my having a chance with 
dominique. that hell-cat--i'm not sure she'd ever look at me."

"you're slipping, peter. there was a time

yourself for a moment and think of others a bit. how do you suppose he'll like that? how will 
he like it when you show him the little guttersnipe that you've preferred to his daughter?"

"he won't like it," keating whispered.

"you bet your life he won't! you bet your life he'll kick you right out on the street! he'll find 
plenty who'll jump at the chance to take your place. how about that bennett fellow?"

"oh, no!" keating gasped so furiously that she knew she had struck right. "not bennett!"

"yes," she said triumphantly. "bennett! that's what it'll be--francon & bennett, while you'll be 
pounding the pavements looking for a job! but you'll have a wife! oh, yes, you'll have a wife!"

"mother, please..

"this is the kind of a wife you'll have. a clumsy little girl who won't know where to put her

 closed, like 
claws; the fingers shook; he could not use his left hand at all. he would not retire. he liked to 
see his name on the firm's stationery.

he wondered dimly why he was no longer introduced to prominent clients, why he never saw 
the sketches of their new buildings, until they were half erected. if he mentioned this, francon 
protested: "but, lucius, i couldn't think of bothering you in your condition. any other man 
would have retired, long ago."

francon puzzled him mildly. peter keating baffled him. keating barely bothered to greet him 
when they met, and then as an afterthought; keating walked off in the middle of a sentence 
addressed to him; when heyer issued some minor order to one of the draftsmen, it was not 
carried out and the draftsman informed him that the order had been countermanded by mr. 
keating. heyer could not understand it; he always remembered keating as the diffident boy 
who had talked to him so nicely about old porcelain. he excused keating at first; then
 
 ___________________________
 
 he tried 
to mollify him, humbly and clumsily; then he conceived an unreasoning fear of keating. he 
complained to francon. he said, petulantly, assuming the tone of an authority he could never 
have exercised: "that boy of yours, guy, that keating fellow, he's getting to be impossible. 
he's rude to me. you ought to get rid of him."

"now you see, lucius," francon answered dryly, "why i say that you should retire. you're 
overstraining your nerves and you're beginning to imagine things."

then came the competition for the cosmo-slotnick building.

cosmo-slotnick pictures of hollywood, california, had decided to erect a stupendous home 
office in new york, a skyscraper to house a motion-picture theater and forty floors of offices. a 
worl

ay and to cost ten million dollars; it was to symbolize the genius of modern technology 
and the spirit of the american people; it was announced in advance as "the most beautiful 
building in the world." the jury of award consisted of mr. shupe, representing cosmo, mr. 
slotnick, representing slotnick. professor peterkin of the stanton institute of technology, the 
mayor of the city of new york, ralston holcombe, president of the a.g.a., and ellsworth m. 
toohey.

"go to it, peter!" francon told keating enthusiastically. "do your best. give me all you've got. 
this is your great chance. you'll be known the world over if you win. and here's what we'll do: 
we'll put your name on our entry, along with the firm's. if we win, you'll get one fifth of the prize. 
the grand prize is sixty thousand dollars, you know."

"heyer will object" said keating cautiously.

"let him object. that's why i'm doing it. he might get it through his head what's the decent 

thing for him to do. and i...well, you know

 already?"

"what competition?"

"why, the competition. the cosmo-slotnick competition."

"i'm not sending any entry."

"you're...not? not at all?"

"no."

"why?"

"i don't enter competitions."

"why, for heaven's sake?"

"come on, peter. you didn't come here to discuss that."

"as a matter of fact i did think i'd show you my own entry, you understand i'm not asking you 
to help me, i just want your reaction, just a general opinion."

he hastened to open the folder.

roark studied the sketches. keating snapped: "well? is it all right?"

"no. it's rotten. and you know it."

then, for hours, while keating watched and the sky darkened and lights flared up in the 
windows of the city, roark talked, explained, slashed lines through the plans, untangled the 
labyrinth of the theater's exits out windows, unraveled halls, smashed useless arches, 
straightened stairways. keating stammered once: "jesus, howard! why don't you enter the 
competition, if you can do it like this?" roark answered: "because 
 
 ___________________________
 
i can't. i couldn't if i tried. i 
dry up. i go blank. i can't give them what they want. but i can straighten someone else's damn 
mess when i see it:"

it was morning when he pushed the plans aside. keating whispered:

"and the elevation?"

"oh, to hell with your elevation! i don't want to look at your damn renaissance elevations!" but 
he looked. he could not prevent his hand from cutting lines across the perspective. "all right, 
damn you, give them good renaissance if you must and if there is such a thing! only i can't 
do that for you. figure it out yourself. something like this. simpler. peter, simpler, more direct, 
as honest as you can make of a dishonest thing. now go home and try to work 
 
 ___________________________
 
out something 
on this order."

keating went home. he copied roark's plans. he worked out roark's hasty sketch of the 
elevation into a neat, finished perspective. then the drawings were mailed, properly 
addressed to:
#

"the most beautiful building in the world" competition

cosmo-slotnick pictures, inc.

new york city.
#

the envelope, accompanying the entry, contained the names: "francon & heyer, architects, 
peter keating, associated designer."
#

through the months of that winter roark found no other chances, no offers, no prospects of 
commissions. he sat at his desk and forgot, at times, to turn on the lights in the early dusk. it 
was as if the heavy immobility of all the hours that had flowed through the office, of its door, of 
its air were beginning to seep into his muscles. he would rise and fling a book at the wall, to 
feel his arm move, to hear the burst of sound. he smiled, amused, picked up the boo

es, we're going to the horse show wednesday. i adore horse 
shows. good night, peter."

he left and walked home through the warm spring night. he walked savagely. if, at that 
moment, someone had offered him sole ownership of the firm of francon & heyer at the price 
of marrying dominique, he would have refused it. he knew also, hating himself, that he would 
not refuse, if it were offered to him on the following morning.

15.

this was fear. this was what one feels in nightmares, thought peter keating, only then one 
awakens when it becomes unbearable, but he could neither awaken nor bear it any longer. it 
had been growing, for days, for weeks, and now it had caught him: this lewd, unspeakable 
dread of defeat. he would lose the competition, he was certain that he would lose it, and the 
certainty grew as each day of waiting passed. he could not work; he jerked when people 
spoke to him; he had not slept for nights.

he walked toward the house of lucius heyer. he tried not to notice the fac
 
 ___________________________
 
nted to shout at them and tell them to turn away, to leave him alone. 
they were staring at him, he thought, because he was to fail and they knew it.

he was going to heyer's house to save himself from the coming disaster in the only way he 
saw left to him. if he failed in that competition--and he knew he was to fail--francon would be 
shocked and disillusioned; then if heyer died, as he could die at any moment, francon would 
hesitate--in the bitter aftermath of a public humiliation--to accept keating as his partner; if 
francon hesitated, the game was lost. there were others waiting for the opportunity: bennett, 
whom he had been unable to get out of the office; claude stengel, who had been doing very 
well on his own, and had approached francon with an offer to buy heyer's place. keating had 
nothing to count on, except francon's uncertain faith in him. once another partner replaced 
heyer, it would be the end of keating's future. he had come too close and had missed. that 
was never forgi
 
 ___________________________
 
sue at once; he had to take advantage of francon's deluded hopes before the 
winner of the competition was announced; he had to force heyer out and take his place; he 
had only a few days left.

he remembered francon's gossip about heyer's character. he looked through the files in 
heyer's office and found what he had hoped to find. it was a letter from a contractor, written 
fifteen years ago; it stated merely that the contractor was enclosing a check for twenty 
thousand dollars due mr. heyer. keating looked up the records for that particular building; it 
did seem that the structure had cost more than it should have cost. that was the year when 
heyer had started his collection of porcelain.

he found heyer alone in his study. it was a small, dim room and the air in it seemed heavy, as 
if it had not been disturbed for years. the dark mahogany paneling, the tapestries, the 
priceless pieces of old furniture were kept faultlessly clean, but the room smelt, somehow, of 
indigence and of decay
 
 ___________________________
 
. there was a single lamp burning on a small table in a corner, and five 
delicate, precious cups of ancient porcelain on the table. heyer sat hunched, examining the 
cups in the dim light, with a vague, pointless enjoyment. he shuddered a little when his old 
valet admitted keating, and he blinked in vapid bewilderment, but he asked keating to sit 
down.

when he heard the first sounds of his own voice, keating knew he had lost the fear that had 
followed him on his way through the streets; his voice was cold and steady. tim davis, he 
thought, claude stengel, and now just one more to be removed.

he explained what he wanted, spreading upon the still air of the room one short, concise, 
complete paragraph of thought, perfect as a gem with clean edges.

"and so, unless you inform francon of your retirement tomorrow morning," he concluded, 
holding the letter by a corner between two fingers, "this goes 
 
 ___________________________
 
to the a.g.a."

he waited. heyer sat still, with his pale, bulging eyes blank and his mouth open in a perfect 
circle. keating shuddered and wondered whether he was speaking to an idiot.

then heyer's mouth moved and his pale pink tongue showed, flickering against his lower 
teeth.

"but i don't want to retire." he said it simply, guilelessly, in a little petulant whine.

"you will have to retire."

"i don't want to. i'm not going to. i'm a famous architect. i've always been a famous architect. i 
wish people would stop bothering me. they all want me to retire. i'll tell you a secret." he 
leaned forward; he whispered
 
 ___________________________
 
 slyly: "you may not know it, but i know, he can't deceive me; 
guy wants me to retire. he thinks he's outwitting me, but i can see through him. that's a good 
one on guy." he giggled softly.

"i don't think you understood me. do you understand this?" keating pushed the letter into 
heyer's half-closed fingers.

he watched the thin sheet trembling as heyer held it. then it dropped to the table and heyer's 
left hand with the paralyzed fingers jabbed at it blindly, purposelessly, like a hook. he said, 
gulping:

"you can't send this to the a.g.a. they'll have my license taken away."

"certainly," said keating, "they will."

"and it will be in the papers."

"in all of them."

"you can't do that."

"i'm going to--unless you retire."

heyer's shoulders 
 
 ___________________________
 
drew down to the edge of the table. his head remained above the edge, 
timidly, as if he were ready to draw it also out of sight.

"you won't do that please you won't," heyer mumbled in one long whine without pauses. 
"you're a nice boy you're a very nice boy you won't do it will you?"

the yellow square of paper lay on the table. heyer's useless left hand reached for it, crawling 
slowly over the edge. keating leaned forward and snatched the letter from under his hand.

heyer looked at him, his head bent to one side, his mouth open. he looked as if he expected 
keating to strike him; with a sickening, pleading glance that said he would allow keating to 
strike him.

"please," whispered heyer, "you won't do that, will you? i don't feel very well. i've never hurt 
you. i seem to remember, i did something very nice for you once."

"what?" snapped keating. "what did you do for me?"

"your name's peter ke

we'll make you a designer one of these days." his mouth remained hanging open on the 
word. a thin strand of saliva trickled down from the corner of his mouth. "please...don't..."

keating's eyes were bright with disgust; aversion goaded him on; he had to make it worse 
because he couldn't stand it.

"you'll be exposed publicly," said keating, the sounds of his voice glittering. "you'll be 
denounced as a grafter. people will point at you. they'll print your picture in the papers. the 
owners of that building will sue you. they'll throw you in jail."

heyer said nothing. he did not move. keating heard the cups on the table tinkling suddenly. 
he could not see the shaking of heyer's body. he heard a thin, glassy ringing in the silence of 
the room, as if the cups were trembling of themselves.

"get out!" said keating, raising his voi

o stay for? you're no good. you've never been any good."

the yellow face at the edge of the table opened its mouth and made a wet, gurgling sound like 
a moan.

keating sat easily, leaning forward, his knees spread apart, one elbow resting on his knee, the 
hand hanging down, swinging the letter.

"i..." heyer choked. "i..."

"shut up! you've got nothing to say, except yes or no. think fast now. i'm not here to argue 
with you."

heyer stopped trembling. a shadow cut diagonally across his face. keating saw one eye that 
did not blink, and half a mouth, open, the darkness flowing in through the hole, into the face, 
as if it were drowning.

"answer me!" keating screamed, frightened suddenly. "why don't you answer me?"

the half-face swayed and he saw the head lurch forward; it fell down on the table, and went 
on, and rolled to the floor, as it cut off; two of the cups fell after it, cracking softly to pieces on 
the carpet. the first thing keating felt was relief to see that the body had foll

and lay crumpled in a heap on the floor, intact. there had been no sound; only the muffled, 
musical bursting of porcelain.

he'll be furious, thought keating, looking down at the cups. he had jumped to his feet, he was 
kneeling, gathering the pieces pointlessly; he saw that they were broken beyond repair. he 
knew he was thinking also, at the same time, that it had come, that second stroke they had 
been expecting, and that he would have to do something about it in a moment, but that it was 
all right, because heyer would have to retire now.

then he moved on his knees closer to heyer's body. he wondered why he did not want to 
touch it. "mr. heyer

vomit. he rose, walked across the room and threw the door open, because he remembered 
that there was the rest of the apartment somewhere and a valet in it, and he called, trying to 
scream for help.

keating came to the office as usual. he answered questions, he explained that heyer had 
asked him, that day, to come to his house after dinner; heyer had wanted to discuss the 
matter of his retirement. no one doubted the story and keating knew that no one ever would. 
heyer's end had come as everybody had expected it to come. francon felt nothing but relief. 
"we knew he would, sooner or later," said francon. "why regret that he spared himself and all 
of us a prolonged agony?"

keating's manner was calmer than it had been for weeks. it was the calm of blank stupor. the 
thought followed him, gentle, unstressed, monotonous, at his work, at home, at night: he was 
a murderer...no, but almost a murderer...almost a murderer...he kn

he felt fine; he hoped the useless questions would never come back to him again; every man

the useless questions never came back to him again. he had no time for them in the days 
that followed. he had won the cosmo-slotnick competition.

peter keating had known it would be a triumph, but he had not expected the thing that 
happened. he had dreamed of a sound of trumpets; he had not foreseen a symphonic 
explosion.

it began with the thin ringing of a telephone, announcing the names of the winners. then 
every phone in the office joined in, screaming, bursting from under the fingers of the operator 
who could barely control the switchboard; calls from every paper in town, from famous 
architects, questions, demands for interviews, congratulat

ions. then the flood rushed out of 
the elevators, poured through the office doors, the messages, the telegrams, the people 
keating knew, the people he had never seen before, the reception clerk losing all sense, not 
knowing whom to admit or refuse, and keating shaking hands, an endless stream of hands 
like a wheel with soft moist cogs flapping against his fingers. he did not know what he said at 
that first interview, with francon's office full of people and cameras; francon had thrown the 
doors of his liquor cabinet wide-open. francon gulped to all these people that the cosmo-
slotnick building had been created by peter keating alone; francon did not care; he was 
magnanimous in a spurt of enthusiasm; besides, it made a good story.

it made a bett

er story than francon had expected. from the pages of newspapers the face of 
peter keating looked upon the country, the handsome, wholesome, smiling face with the 
brilliant eyes and the dark curls; it headed columns of print about poverty, struggle, aspiration 
and unremitting toil that had won their reward; about the faith of a mother who had sacrificed 
everything to her boy's success; about the "cinderella of architecture."

cosmo-slotnick were pleased; they had not thought that prize-winning architects could also be 
young, handsome and poor--well, so recently poor. they had dis

cosmo-slotnick adored boy geniuses; mr. slotnick was one himself, being only forty-three.

keating's drawings of the "most beautiful skyscraper on earth" were reproduced in the papers, 
with the words of the award underneath: "...for the brilliant skill and simplicity of its plan...for its 
clean, ruthless efficiency...for its ingenious economy of space...for the masterful blending of 

the modern with the traditional in art...to francon & heyer and peter keating..."

keating appeared in newsreels, shaking hands with mr. shupe and mr. slotnick, and the 
subtitle announced what these two gentlemen thought of his building. keating appeared in 
newsreels, shaking hands with miss dimples williams, and the subtitle announced what he

for a week, on the stage of the cosmo theater, with the first run of the latest cosmo-slotnick 
special; he bowed over the footlights, slim and graceful in a black tuxedo, and he spoke for 
two minutes on the significance of architecture. he presided as judge at a beauty contest in 
atlantic city, the winner to be awarded a screen test by cosmo-slotnick. he

mrs. keating had sobbed at first, clasped peter in her arms and gulped that she could not 
believe it. she had stammered, answering questions about petey, and she had posed for 
pictures, embarrassed, eager to please. then she became used to it. she told peter, 
shrugging, that of course he had won, it was nothing to gape at, no one else could have won. 
she acquired a brisk little tone of condescension for the reporters. she was distinctly annoyed

tical danger, he could 
dispose of it quite simply. he chuckled with relief, he telephoned roark's office, and made an 
appointment to see him.

he went to that appointment confidently. for the first time in his life he felt free of the strange 
uneasiness which he had never been able to explain or escape in roark's presence. he felt 
safe now. he was through with howard roark.
#

roark sat at the desk in his office, waiting. the telephone had rung once, that morning, but it 
had been only peter keating asking for an appointment. he had forgotten now that keating 
was coming. he was waiting for the telephone. he had become dependent on that telephone 
in the last few weeks. he was to hear at any moment about his drawings for the manhattan 
bank company.

his rent on the office was long since overdue. so was the rent on the room where he lived. he 
did not care about the room; he could tell the landlord to wait; the landlord waited; it would not 
have mattered greatly if he had stopped waiting.

ost promise you. if not tomorrow, 
then it will have to wait over the week end, but by monday i promise it for certain....you've 
been wonderfully patient with us, mr. roark. we appreciate it." roark dropped the receiver. 
he closed his eyes. he thought he would allow himself to rest, just to rest blankly like this for a 
few minutes, before he would begin to think of what the date on the telephone notice had been
and in what way he could manage to last until monday.

"hello, howard," said peter keating.

he opened his eyes. keating had entered and stood before him, smiling. he wore a light tan 
spring coat, thrown open, the loops of its belt like handles at his sides, a blue cornflower in his 
buttonhole. he stood, his legs apart, his fists on his hips, his hat on the back of his head, his 
black curls so bright and crisp over his pale forehead that one expected to see drops of spring 
dew glistening on them as on the cornflower.

"hello, peter," said roark.

keating sat down comfortably, to

he understood that it was a confession, that answer of his, and a terrifying one. he did not 
know the nature of what he had confessed and he felt certain that roark did not know it either. 
but the thing had been bared; they could not grasp it, but they felt its shape. and it made them 
sit silently, facing each other, in astonishment, in resignation.

"pull yourself together, peter," said roark gently, as to a comrade. "we'll never speak of that 
again."

then keating said suddenly, his voice clinging in relief to the bright vulgarity of its new tone:

"aw hell, howard, i was only talking good plain horse sense. now if you wanted to work like a 
normal person--"

"shut up!" snapped roark.

keating leaned back, exhausted. he had nothing else to say. he had forgotten what he had 
come here to discuss.

"now," said roark, "what did you want to tell me about the competition?"

keating jerked forward. he wondered what had made roark guess that. and then it became

easier, because he forgot the rest in a sweeping surge of resentment.

"oh, yes!" said keating crisply, a bright edge of irritation in the sound of his voice. "yes, i did 
want to speak to you about that. thanks for reminding me. of course, you'd guess it, because 
you know that i'm not an ungrateful swine. i really came here to thank you, howard. i haven't 
forgotten that you had a share in that building, you did give me some advice on it. i'd be the 
first one to give you part of the credit."

"that's not necessary."

"oh, it's not that i'd mind, but i'm sure you wouldn't want me to sa

money, i thought it's only fair to let you have some of it. i'm glad that it comes at a time when 
you need it so badly."

he produced his billfold, pulled from it a check he had made out in advance and put it down 
on the desk. it read: "pay to the order of howard roark--the sum of five hundred dollars."

"thank you, peter," said roark, taking the check.

then he turned it over, took his fountain pen, wrote on the back: "pay to the order of peter 
keating," signed and handed the check to keating.

"and here's my bribe to you, peter," he said. "for the same purpose. to keep your mouth 
shut."

keating stared at him blankly.

"that's all i can offer you now," said roark. "you can't extort anything from me at present, but 
later, when i'll have money, i'd like to ask you please not to blackmail me. i'm telling you 
frankly that you could. because i don't want anyone to know that i had anything to do with that 
building."

he laughed at the slow look of comprehension on keating's face.

"

no?" said roark. "you don't want to blackmail me on that?...go home, peter. you're perfectly 
safe. i'll never say a word about it. it's yours, the building and every girder of it and every foot 
of plumbing and every picture of your face in the papers."

then keating jumped to his feet. he was shaking.

"god damn you!" he screamed. "god damn you! who do you think you are? who told you that 
you could do this to people? so you're too good for that building? you want to make me 
ashamed of it? you rotten, lousy, conceited bastard! who are you? you don't even have the 
wits to know that you're a flop, an incompetent, a beggar, a failure, a failure, a failure! and you 
stand there pronouncing judgment! you, against the whole country! you against everybody!

damn thing."

he picked up the check, struck a match, cautiously watched the paper burn till he had to drop 
the last scrap.

"howard, we'll forget it?"

"don't you think you'd better go now?"

keating rose heavily, his hands poked about in a few useless gestures, and he mumbled:

"well...well, good night, howard. i...i'll see you soon....it's because so much's happened to me 
lately....guess i need a rest....so long, howard...."

when he stepped out into the hall and closed the door behind him, keating felt an icy sense of 
relief. he felt heavy and very tired, but drearily sure of himself. he had acquired the 
knowledge of one thing: he hated roark. it was not necessary to doubt and wonder and 
squirm in uneasiness any longer. it was simple. he hated roark. the reasons? it was not 
necessary to wonder about the reasons. it was necessary only to hate, to hate blindly, to hate 
patiently, to hate without anger; only to hate, and let nothing intervene, and not let oneself 
forget, ever.

little pinheads of light flared up about the peak of one famous tower, in the windows of the 
star roof restaurant. then the train swerved around a bend and the city vanished.

that evening, in the banquet hall of the star roof restaurant, a dinner was held to celebrate 

the admittance of peter keating to partnership in the firm to be known henceforward as 
francon & keating.

at the long table that seemed covered, not with a tablecloth, but with a sheet of light, sat guy 
francon. somehow, tonight, he did not mind the streaks of silver that appeared on his 
temples; they sparkled crisply against the black of his hair and they gave him an air of 
cleanliness and elegance, like the rigid white of his shirt against his black evening clothes. in 
the place of honor sat peter keating. he leaned b

would ask for his name.

3.

when peter keating entered the office, the opening of the door sounded like a single high 
blast on a trumpet. the door flew forward as if it had opened of itself to the approach of a man 
before whom all doors were to open in such manner.

his day in the office began with the newspapers. there was a neat pile of them waiting, 
stacked on his desk by his secretary. he liked to see what new mentions appeared in print 
about the progress of the cosmo-slotnick building or the firm of francon & keating.

there were n

o mentions in the papers this morning, and keating frowned. he saw, however, a 
story about ellsworth m. toohey. it was a startling story. thomas l. foster, noted 
philanthropist, had died and had left, among larger bequests, the modest sum of one hundred 
thousand dollars to ellsworth m. toohey, "my friend and spiritual guide--in appreciation of his 
noble mind and true devotion to humanity." ellsworth m. toohey had accepted the legacy and 
had turned it over, intact, to the "workshop of social study," a progressive institute of learning 
wher

e he held the post of lecturer on "art as a social symptom." he had given the simple 
explanation that he "did not believe in the institution of private inheritance." he had refused all 
further comment. "no, my friends," he had said, "not about this." and had added, with his 
charming knack for destroying the earnestness of his own moment: "i like to indulge in the 
luxury of commenting solely upon interesting subjects. i do not consider myself one of these."

peter keating read the story. and because he knew that it was an action which he would 
never have committed, he admired it tremendously.

then he thought, with a familiar twinge of annoyance, that he had not been able to meet 
ellsworth toohey. toohey had left on a lecture tour shortly after the award in the cosmo-
slotnick competition, and the brilliant gatherings keating had attended ever since were made 
empty by the absence of the one man he'd been most eager to meet. no mention of keating's 
name had a

"one small voice" in the banner. but "one small voice" was subtitled "songs and things" 
today, and was devoted to proving the superiority of folk songs over any other forms of 
musical art, and of choral singing over any other manner of musical rendition.

keating dropped the banner. he got up and paced viciously across the office, because he had 
to turn now to a disturbing problem. he had been postponing it for several mornings. it was 
the matte

r of choosing a sculptor for the cosmo-slotnick building. months ago the 
commission for the giant statue of "industry" to stand in the main lobby of the building had 
been awarded--tentatively--to steven mallory. the award had puzzled keating, but it had been 
made by mr. slotnick, so keating had approved of it. he had interviewed mallory and said: 
"...in recognition of your unusual ability...of course you have no name, but you will have, after 
a commission like this...they don't come every day like this building of mine."

he had not liked mallory. mallory's eyes were like black holes left after a fire not quite put out, 
and mallory had not smiled once. he was twenty-four years old, had had one show of his 
work, but not many commissions. his work was strange and too violent. ke

sted with the job, he might, 
perhaps, have done better than the almighty, if we are to judge by what he passes as human 
bodies in stone. or would he?"

keating had been baffled by mr. slotnick's choice, until he heard that dimples williams had 

once lived in the same greenwich village tenement with steven mallory, and mr. slotnick 
could refuse nothing to dimples williams at the moment. mallory had been hired, had worked 
and had submitted a model of his statue of "industry." when he saw it, keating knew that the 
statue would look like a raw gash, like a smear of fire in the neat elegance of his lobby. it was 
a slender naked body of a man who looked as if he could break through the steel plate of a 
battleship and through any barrier whatever. it stood like a challenge. it left a strange stamp 
on one's eyes. it made the people around it seem smaller and sadder than usual. for the first 
time in his life, looking at that statue, keating thought he understood what was meant by the 
word "

heroic."

he said nothing. but the model was sent on to mr. slotnick and many people said, with 
indignation, what keating had felt. mr. slotnick asked him to select another sculptor and left 
the choice in his hands.

keating flopped down in an armchair, leaned back and clicked his tongue against his palate. 
he wondered whether he should give the commission to bronson, the sculptor who was a 
friend of mrs. shupe, wife of the president of cosmo; or to palmer, who had been 
recommended by mr. huseby who was planning the erection of a new five-million-dollar 
cosmetic factory. keating discovered that he liked this

looming on our architectural horizon in the person of a mere boy named peter keating.

 four-thirty of the next 
afternoon.

in the hours that followed, his daily work assumed a new relish. it was as if his usual activity 
had been only a bright, flat mural and had now become a noble bas-relief, pushed forward, 
given a three-dimensional reality by the words of ellsworth toohey.

guy francon descended from his office once in a while, for no ascertainable purpose. the 
subtler shades of his shirts and socks matched the gray of his temples. he stood smiling 
benevolently in silence. keating flashed past him in the drafting room and acknowledged his 
presence, not stopping, but slowing his steps long enough to plant a crackling bit of 
newspaper into the folds of the mauve handkerchief in francon's breast-pocket, with "read 
that when you have time, guy." he added, his steps halfway across the next room: "want to 
have lunch with me today, guy? wait for me at the plaza."

when he came back from lunch, keating was stopped by a young draftsman who asked, his 
voice high with exciteme

nt:

"say, mr. keating, who's it took a shot at ellsworth toohey?"

keating managed to gasp out:

"who is it did what?"

"shot mr. toohey."

"who?"

"that's what i want to know, who."

"shot...ellsworth toohey?"

"that's what i saw in the paper in the restaurant a guy had. didn't have time to get one."

"he's...killed?"

"that's what i don't know. saw only it said about a shot."

"if he's dead, does that mean they won't publish his column tomorrow?"

"dunno. why, mr. keating?"

"go get me a paper."

"but i've got to..."

"get me that paper, you damned idiot!"

the story was there, in the afternoon papers. a shot had been fired at ellsworth toohey that 
morning, as he stepped out of his car in front of a radio station where he was to deliver an 
address on "the voiceless and the undefended." the shot had missed him. ellsworth toohey 
had remained calm and sane throughout. his behavior had been theatrical only in too 
complete an absence of anything theatrical. he ha

he delivered a half-hour's speech from memory, as he always did. the assailant had said 
nothing when arrested.

keating stared--his throat dry--at the name of the assailant. it was steven mallory.

only the inexplicable frightened keating, particularly when the inexplicable lay, not in tangible 
facts, but in that causeless feeling of dread within him. there was nothing to concern him 
directly in what had happened, except his wish that it had been someone else, anyone but 
steven mallory; and that he didn't know why he should wish this.

steven mallory had remained silent. he had given no explanation of his act. at first, it was 
supposed that he might have been prompted by despair at the loss of his commission for the 
cosmo-s

h the interviews that followed, toohey 
answered questions gaily. he said: "i had never thought myself important enough to warrant 
assassination. it would be the greatest tribute one could possibly expect--if it weren't so much 
in the style of an operetta." he managed to convey the charming impression that nothing of 
importance had happened because nothing of importance ever happened on earth.

mallory was sent to jail to await trial. all efforts to question him failed.

the thought that kept keating uneasily awake for many hours, that night, was the groundless 
certainty that toohey felt exactly as he did. he knows, thought keating, and i know, that there 
is--in steven mallory's motive--a greater danger than in his murderous attempt. but we shall 
never know his motive. or shall we?...and then he touched the core of fear: it was the sudden 

wish that he might be guarded, through the years to come, to the end of his life, from ever 
learning that motive.

keating had grown past the stage of experiencing anxiety at the prospect of meeting a famous

wondered what toohey really looked like. he remembered the magnificent voice he had heard 
in the lobby of the strike meeting, and he imagined a giant of a man, with a rich mane of hair,

made the skull look tight and trim, but left too much emphasis to the ears that flared out in 
solitary nakedness, like the handles of a bouillon cup. the nose was long and thin, prolonged 
by the small dab of a black mustache. the eyes were dark and startling. they held such a 
wealth of intellect and of twinkling gaiety that his glasses seemed to be worn not to protect his 
eyes but to protect other men from their excessive brilliance.

"hello, peter keating," said ellsworth monkton toohey in his compelling, magical voice. "what 
do you think of the temple of nike apteros?"

"how...do you do, mr. toohey," said keating, stopped, stupefied. "what do i think...of what?"

"sit down, my friend. of the temple of nike apteros."

"well...well...i..."

"i feel certain that you couldn't have overlooked that little gem. the parthenon has usurped 
the recognition which--and isn't that usually the case? the bigger and stronger appropriating all 
the glory, whil

awarded to that magnificent little creation of the great free spirit of greece. you've noted, i'm 
sure, the fine balance of its mass, the supreme perfection of its modest proportions--ah, yes, 
you know, the supreme in the modest--the delicate craftsmanship of detail?"

"yes, of course," muttered keating, "that's always been my favorite--the temple of nike 
apteros."

"really?" said ellsworth toohey, with a smile which keating could not quite classify. "i was 
certain of it. i was certain you'd say it. you have a very handsome face, peter keating, when 
you don't stare like this--which is really quite unnecessary."

and toohey was laughing suddenly, laughing quite obviously, quite insultingly, at keating and 
at himself; it was as if he were underscoring the falseness of the whole procedure. keating sat 
aghast for an instant; and then he found himself laughing easily in answer, as if at home with 
a very old friend.

"that's better," said toohey. "don't you find it advisable not to talk too seriously in an 
important moment? and this might be a very important moment--who knows?--for both of us. 
and, of course, i knew you'd be a little afraid of me and--oh, i admit--i was quite a bit afraid of 
you, so isn't this much better?"

"oh, yes, mr. toohey," said keating happily. his normal assurance in meeting people had 
vanished; but he felt at ease, as if all responsibility were taken away from him and he did not 
have to worry about saying the right things, because he was being led gently into saying them 
without any effort on his part. "i've always known it would be an important moment when i met 
you, mr. toohey. always. for years."

"really?" said ellsworth toohey, the eyes behind the glasses attentive. "why?"

"because i'd always hoped that i would pl

like that, through your eyes...i...i've..." toohey listened 
watchfully. "i've always wanted to meet you because you're such a profound thinker and a 
man of such cultural distinc--"

"now," said toohey, his voice kindly but a little impatient; his interest had dropped on that last 
sentence. "none of that. i don't mean to be ungracious, but we'll dispense with that sort of 
thing, shall we? unnatural as this may sound, i really don't like to hear personal praise."

it was toohey's eyes, thought keating, that put him at ease. there was such a vast 
understanding in toohey's eyes and such an unfastidious kindness--no, what a word to think 
of--such an unlimited kindness. it was as if one could hide nothing from him, but it was not 
necessary to hide it, because he would forgive anything. they were the most unaccusing eyes 
that keating had ever seen.

"but, mr. toohey," he muttered, "i did want to..."

"you wanted to thank me for my article," said toohey and made a little grimace of gay

r. "and here i've been trying so hard to prevent you from doing it. do let me get away 
with it, won't you? there's no reason why you should thank me. if you happened to deserve 
the things i said--well, the credit belongs to you, not to me. doesn't it?"

"but i was so happy that you thought i'm..."

"...a great architect? but surely, my boy, you knew that. or weren't you quite sure? never quite 
sure of it?"

"well, i..."

it was only a second's pause. and it seemed to keating that this pause was all toohey had 
wanted to hear from him; toohey did not wait for the rest, but spoke as if he had received a 
full answer, and an answer that pleased him.

"and as for the cosmo-slotnick building, who can deny that it's an extraordinary 
achievement? you know, i was greatly intrigued by its plan. it's a most ingenious plan. a 
brilliant plan. very unusual. quite different from what i have observed in your previous work. 
isn't it?"

"naturally," said keating, his voice clear
 
 ___________________________
 
 and hard for the first time, "the problem was different 
from anything i'd done before, so i worked out that plan to fit the particular requirements of the 
problem."

"of course," said toohey gently. "a beautiful piece of work. you should be proud of it."

keating noticed that toohey's eyes stood centered in the middle of the lenses and the lenses 
stood focused straight on his pupils, and keating knew suddenly that toohey knew he had not 
designed the plan of the cosmo-slotnick building. this did not frighten him. what frightened 
him was that he saw approval in toohey's eyes.

"if you must feel--no, not gratitude, gratitude is such an embarrassing word--but, shall we say, 
appreciation?" toohey continued, and his voice had grown softer, as if keating were a fellow 
conspirator who would know that the words used were to be, from now on, a code for a private 
meaning, "you might thank m

e for understanding the symbolic implications of your building 
and for stating them in words as you stated them in marble. since, of course, you are not just 
a common mason, but a thinker in stone."

"yes," said keating, "that was my abstract theme, when i designed the building--the great 
masses and the flowers of culture. i've always believed that true culture springs from the 
common man. but i had no hope that anyone would ever understand me."

toohey smiled. his thin lips slid open, his teeth showed. he was not looking at keating. he 
was looking down at his own hand, the long, slender, sensitive hand of a concert pianist, 
moving a sheet of paper on the desk. then he said: "perhaps we're brothers of the

spirit, 
keating. the human spirit. that is all that matters in life"--not looking at keating, but past him, 
the lenses raised flagrantly to a line over keating's face.

and keating knew that toohey knew he had never thought of any abstract theme until he'd 
read that article, and more: that toohey approved again. when the lenses moved slowly to 
keating's face, the eyes were sweet with affection, an affection very cold and very real. then 
keating felt as if the walls of the room were moving gently in upon him, pushing him into a 
terrible intimacy, not with toohey, but with some unknown guilt. he wanted to leap to his feet 
and run. he sat still, his mouth half open.

d without knowing what prompted him, keating heard his own voice in the silence:

"and i did want to say how glad i was that you escaped that maniac's bullet yesterday, mr. 
toohey."

"oh?...oh, thanks. that? well! don't let it upset you. just one of the minor penalties one pays 
for prominence in public life."

"i've never liked mallory. a strange sort of person. too tense. i don't like people who're tense. 
i've never liked his work either."

"just an exhibitionist. won't amount to much."

"it wasn't my idea, of course, to give him a tr

slotnick knew better in the end."

"did mallory ever mention my name to you?"

"no. never."

"i haven't even met him, you know. never saw him before. why did he do it?"

and then it was toohey who sat still, before what he saw on keating's face; toohey, alert and 
insecure for the first time. this was it, thought keating, this was the bond between them, and 
the bond was fear, and more, much more than that, but fear was the only recognizable name 
to give it. and he knew, with unreasoning finality, that he liked toohey better than any man he 
had ever met.

"well, you know how it is," said keating brightly, hoping that the commonplace he was about 
to utter would close the subject. "mallory is an incompetent and knows it and he decided to 
take it out on you as a symbol of the great and the able."

of a smile, keating saw the shot of toohey's sudden glance at him; it was not a 
glance, it was a fluoroscope, he thought he could feel it crawling searchingly inside his bones. 
then toohey's face seemed to harden, drawing together again in composure, and keating 
knew that toohey had found relief somewhere, in his bones or in his gaping, bewildered face, 
that some hidden immensity of ignorance within him had given toohey reassurance. then 
toohey said slowly, strangely, derisively:

"you and i, we're going to be great friends, peter."

keating let a moment pass before he caught himself to answer hastily:

"oh, i hope so, mr. toohey!"

"really, peter! i'm not as old as all that, am i? 'ellsworth' is the monument to my parents' 
peculiar taste in nomen

enemies one knows that one's dangerous where it's necessary to be dangerous. there are 
things that must be destroyed--or they'll destroy us. we'll see a great deal of each other, 
peter." the voice was smooth and sure now, with the finality of a decision tested and reached, 
with the certainty that never again would anything in keating be a question mark to him. "for 
instance, i've been thinking for some time of getting together a few young architects--i know 
so many of them--just an informal little organization, to exchange ideas, you know, to develop 
a spirit of co-operation, to follow a common line of action for the common good of the 
profession if necessity arises. nothing as stuffy as the a.g.a. just a youth group. think you'd 
be interested?"

"why, of course! and you'd be the chairman?"

"oh dear, no. i'm never cha

ter. strange as it may sound, a totally selfless 
interest in one's fellow men is possible in this world, peter."

then they talked about lois cook and her three published works--"novels? no, peter, not 
exactly novels....no, not collections of stories either...that's just it, just lois cook--a new form 
of literature entirely..."--about the fortune she had inherited from a long line of successful 
tradesmen, and about the house she planned to build.

it was only when toohey had risen to escort keating to the door--and keating noted how 
precariously erect he stood on his very small feet--that toohey paused suddenly to say:

"incidentally, it seems to me as if i should remember some personal connection between us, 
though for the life of me i can't quite place...oh, yes, of course. my niece. little catherine."

keating felt his face tighten, and knew he must not allow this to be discussed, but smiled 
awkwardly instead of protesting.

"i understand you're engaged to her?"

"yes."

"charming,"
 
 ___________________________
 
 said toohey. "very charming. should enjoy being your uncle. you love her very 
much?"

"yes," said keating. "very much."

the absence of stress in his voice made the answer solemn. it was, laid before toohey, the 
first bit of sincerity and of importance within keating's being.

"how pretty," said toohey. "young love. spring and dawn and heaven and drugstore 
chocolates at a dollar and a quarter a box. the prerogative of the gods and of the 
movies....oh, i do approve, peter. i think it's lovely. you couldn't have made a better choice 
than catherine. she's just the kind for whom the world is well lost--the world with all its 
problems and all its opportunities for greatness--oh, yes, well lost because she's innocent and 
sweet and pretty and anemic."

"if yo

"oh, peter, of course i understand. and i approve. i'm a realist. man has always insisted on 
making an ass of himself. oh, come now, we must never lose our sense of humor. nothing's 
really sacred but a sense of humor. still, i've always loved the tale of tristan and isolde. it's

peter keating squinted his eyes, his glance unfocused as for a great distance, but put the 
book down. the book was thin and black, with scarlet letters forming: clouds and shrouds by 
lois cook. the jacket said that it was a record of miss cook's travels around the world.

keating leaned back with a sense of warmth and well-being. he liked this book. it had made 
the routine of his sunday morning breakfast a profound spiritual experience; he was certain 
that it was profound, because he didn't understand it

.

peter keating had never felt the need to formulate abstract convictions. but he had a working 
substitute. "a thing is not high if one can reach it; it is not great if one can reason about it; it is 
not deep if one can see its bottom"--this had always been his credo, unstated and 
unquestioned. this spared him any attempt to reach, reason or see; and it cast a nice 
reflection of scorn on those who made the attempt. so he was able to enjoy the work of lois 
cook. he felt uplifted by the knowledge of his own
 
 ___________________________
 
 capacity to respond to the abstract, the 
profound, the ideal. toohey had said: "that's just it, sound as sound, the poetry of words as 
words, style as a revolt against style. but only the fines' spirit can appreciate it, peter." keating 
thought he could talk of this book to his friends, and if they did not understand he would know 
that he was superior to them. he would not need to explain that superiority--that's just it, 
"superiority as superiority"--automatically denied to those who asked for explanations. he 

loved the book.

he reached for another piece of toast. he saw, at the end of the table, left there for him by his 
mother, the heavy pile of the sunday paper. he picked it up, feeling strong enough, in this 
mome

ematical order holding together a free, fantastic growth; straight lines and 
clean angles, space slashed with a knife, yet in a harmony of formation as delicate as the 
work of a jeweler; an incredible variety of shapes, each separate unit unrepeated, but leading 
inevitably to the next one and to the whole; so that the future inhabitants were to have, not a 
square cage out of a square pile of cages, but each a single house held to the other houses 
like a single crystal to the side of a rock. keating looked at the sketch. he had known for a 
long time that howard roark had been chosen to build the enright house. he had seen a few 
mentions of roark's name in the papers; not much, all of it to be summed up only as "some 
young architect chosen by mr. enright for some reason, probably an interesting young 
architect." the caption under the drawing announced that the construction of the project was 
to begin at once. well, thought keating, and dropped the paper, so what? the paper fell 
beside

 the black and scarlet book. he looked at both. he felt dimly as if lois cook were his 
defense against howard roark. "what's that, petey?" his mother's voice asked behind him. 
he handed the paper to her over his shoulder. the paper fell past him back to the table in a 
second. "oh," shrugged mrs. keating. "huh..." she stood beside him. her trim silk dress was 
fitted too tightly, revealing the solid rigidity of her corset; a small pin glittered at her throat, 
small enough to display ostentatiously that it was made of real diamonds. she was like the 
new apartment into which they had moved: conspicuously expensive. the apartment's 
decoration had been keating's first professional job for himself. it had been furnished in fresh, 
new mid-victorian. it was conservative and stately. over the firep

expectantly. he added: "katie will be there."

the name seemed to have no effect on her whatever. a strange assurance had coated her 
lately, like a layer of fat through which that particular question could penetrate no longer.

"just a family tea," he emphasized. "that's what he said."

"very nice of him. i'm sure mr. toohey is a very intelligent man."

"yes, mother."

he rose impatiently and went to his room.
#

it was keating's first visit to the distinguished residential hotel where catherine and her uncle 
had moved recently. he did not notice much about the apartment, beyond remembering that it 
was simple, very clean and smartly modest, that it contained a great number of books and 
very few pictures, but these authentic and precious. one never remembered the apartment of 
ellsworth toohey, only its host. the host, on this sunday afternoon, wore a dark gray suit, 

correct as a uniform, and bedroom slippers of 
 
 ___________________________
 
black patent leather trimmed with red; the 
slippers mocked the severe elegance of the suit, yet completed the elegance as an audacious 
anticlimax. he sat in a broad, low chair and his face wore an expression of cautious 
gentleness, so cautious that keating and catherine felt, at times, as if they were insignificant 
soap bubbles.

keating did not like the way catherine sat on the edge of a chair, hunched, her legs drawn 
awkwardly together. he wished she would not wear the same suit for the third season, but she 
did. she kept her eyes on one point somewhere in the middle of the carpet. she seldom 
looked at keating. she never looked at her uncle. keating found no trace of that joyous 
admiration with which she had always spoken of toohey, which

launder his handkerchiefs and bear his children, though of course the children will all have 
measles at one time or another, which is a nuisance."

"but, after all, you...you do approve of it?" keating asked anxiously.

"approve of it? of what, peter?"

"of our marriage...eventually."

"what a superfluous question, peter! of course, i approve of it. but how young you are! that's 
the way of young people--they make an issue where none exists. you asked that as if the 
whole thing were important enough to disapprove of."

"katie and i met seven years ago," said keating defensively. "and it was love at first sight of 
course?"

"yes," said keating and felt himself being ridiculous. "it must have

change my clothes, but that doesn't matter, who cares what i look like? and"--the harsh note 
was gone, she was speaking eagerly and very fast--"uncle ellsworth, imagine! little billy 
hansen had a sore throat--you remember billy? and the nurse wasn't there, and i had to swab 
his throat with argyrol, the poor thing! he had the most awful white mucus patches down in his 
throat!" her voice seemed to shine, as if she were speaking of great beauty. she looked at her 
uncle. for the first time keating saw the affection he had expected. she went on speaking 
about her work, the children, the settlement. toohey listened gravely. he said nothing. but the 
earnest attention in his eyes changed him, his mocking gaiety vanished and he forgot his own 
advice, he was being serious, very serious indeed. when he noticed that catherine's plate 
was empty, he offered her the sandwich tray with a simple gesture and made it, somehow, a 
gracious gesture of respect.

keating waited impatiently till she pau

sed for an instant. he wanted to change the subject. he 
glanced about the room and saw the sunday papers. this was a question he had wanted to 
ask for a long time. he asked cautiously:

"ellsworth...what do you think of roark?"

"roark? roark?" asked toohey. "who is roark?" the too innocent, too trifling manner in 
which he repeated the name, with the faint, contemptuous question mark quite audible at the 
end, made keating certain that toohey knew the name well. one did not stress total 
ignorance of a subject if one were in total ignorance of it. keating said:

"howard roark. you know, the architect. the one who's doing the enright house."

"oh? oh, yes, someone's doing that enright house at last, isn't he?"

"there's a picture of it in the chronicle today."

"is there? i did glance through the chronicle."

"and...what do you think of that building?"

"if it were important, i should have remembered it."

he felt a sense of deliverance. it was as if he had spent his life believing that he carried a 
congenital disease, and suddenly the words of the greatest specialist on earth had 
pronounced him healthy. he wanted to laugh, freely, stupidly, without dignity. he wanted to 
talk.

"howard's a friend of mine," he said happily. "a friend of yours? you know hi

m?"

"do i know him! why, we went to school together--stanton, you know--why, he lived at our 
house for three years, i can tell you the color of his underwear and how he takes a shower--
i've seen him!"

"he lived at your house in stanton?" toohey repeated. toohey spoke with a kind of cautious 
precision. the sounds of his voice were small and dry and final, like the cracks of matches 
being broken.

it was very peculiar, thought keating. toohey was asking him a great many questions about 
howard roark. but the questions did not make sense. they were not about buildings, they 
were not about architecture at all. they were pointless personal questions--strange to ask 
about a man of whom he had never heard before.

"does he laugh often?"

"very rarely."

"does he seem unhappy?"

"never."

"did he have many friends at stanton?"

"he's never had any friends anywhere."

"the boys didn't like him?"

"nobody can like him."

"why?"

toohey folded his napkin, a crisp little square of cloth on his knee; he folded it accurately, 
once across each way, and he ran his fingernail along the edges to make a sharp crease.

"do you remember our little youth group of architects, peter?" he asked. "i'm making 
arrangements for a first meeting soon. i've spoken to many of our future members and you'd 
be flattered by what they said about you as our prospective chairman."

they talked pleasantly for another half hour. when keating rose to go, toohey declared:

"oh, yes. i did speak to lois cook about you. you'll hear from her shortly."

"thank you so much, ellsworth. by the way, i'm reading clouds and shrouds."

"and?"

"oh, it's tremendous. you know, ellsworth, it...it makes you think so differently about 
everything you've thought before."

"yes," said toohey, "doesn't it?"

he stood at the window, looking out at the last sunshine of a cold, bright afternoon. then he 
turned and said:

"it's a lovely day. probably one

of the last this year. why don't you take catherine out for a 
little walk, peter?"

"oh, i'd love to!" said catherine eagerly.

"well, go ahead." toohey smiled gaily. "what's the matter, catherine? do you have to wait for 
my permission?"

when they walked out together, when they were alone in the cold brilliance of streets flooded 
with late sunlight, keating felt himself recapturing everything catherine had always meant to 
him, the strange emotion that he could not keep in the presence of others. he closed his hand 
over hers. she withdrew her hand, took off her glove and slipped her fingers into his. and then 
he thought suddenly that hands did perspire when held too long, and he walked faster in 
irritation. he thought that they were walking there like mickey and minnie mouse and that they 
probably appeared ridiculous to the passers-by. to shak

anced down at her face. she was looking straight ahead at the gold light, he saw her 
delicate profile and the faint crease of a smile in the corner of her mouth, a smile of quiet 
happiness. but he noticed that the edge of her eyelid was pale and he began to wonder 
whether she was anemic.

lois cook sat on the floor in the middle of her living room, her legs crossed turkish fashion, 
showing large bare knees, gray stockings rolled over tight garters, and a piece of faded pink 
drawers. peter keating sat on the edge of a violet satin chaise lounge. never before had he 
felt uncomfortable at a first interview with a client.

lois cook was thirty-seven. she had stated insistently, in her publicity and in private 
conversation, that she was sixty-four. it was repeated as a whimsical joke and it created about 

her name a vague impression of eternal youth. she was tall, dry, narrow-shouldered and 
broad-hipped. she had a long, sallow face, and eyes set close together. her hair hung about 
her

candles. to hell with thomas edison! who was he anyway?"

her words did not disturb him as much as her smile. it was not a smile, it was a permanent 
smirk raising the corners of her long mouth, making her look like a sly, vicious imp.

"and, keating, i want the house to be ugly. magnificently ugly. i want it to be the ugliest house 

in new york."

"the...ugliest. miss cook?"

"sweetheart, the beautiful is so commonplace!"

"yes, but...but i...well, i don't see how i could permit myself to..."

"keating, where's your courage? aren't you capable of a sublime gesture on occasion? they

 was not 
quite clear to him just exactly what the revolt was against. somehow, he preferred not to 
know.

he designed the house as she wished it. it was a three-floor edifice, part marble, part stucco, 
adorned with gargoyles and carriage lanterns. it looked like a structure from an amusement 
park.

his sketch of it was reproduced in more publications than any other drawing he had ever 
made, with the exception of the cosmo-slotnick building. one commentator expressed the 
opinion that "peter keating is showing a promise of being more than just a bright young man 
with a knack for pleasing stuffy moguls of big business. he is venturing into the field of 
intellectual experimentation with a client such as lois cook." toohey referred to the house as 
"a cosmic joke."

but a peculiar sensation remained in keating's mind: the feeling of an aftertaste. he would 
experience a dim flash of it while working on some important structure he liked; he would 
experience it in the moments when he felt pr

steven mallory listened and looked as if he were enduring some special process of cruelty. 
the judge gave him two years and suspended the sentence.

there was a great deal of comment on toohey's extraordinary generosity. toohey dismissed 
all praise, gaily and modestly. "my friends," was his remark--the one to appear in all the 
papers--"i refuse to be an accomplice in the manufacturing of martyrs."
#

at the first meeting of the proposed organization of young architects keating concluded that 
toohey had a wonderful ability for choosing people who fitted well together. there was an air 
about the eighteen persons present which he could not define, but which gave him a sense of 
comfort, a security he had not experienced in solitude or in any other gathering; and part of 
the comfort was the knowledge that all the others felt the same way for the same 
unaccountable reason. it was a feeling of brotherhood, but somehow not of a sainted or noble 
brotherhood; yet this pr
 
 ___________________________
 
ecisely was the comfort--that one felt, among them, no necessity for 
being sainted or noble.

were it not for this kinship, keating would have been disappointed in the gathering. of the 
eighteen seated about toohey's living room, none was an architect of distinction, except 
himself and gordon l. prescott, who wore a beige turtle-neck sweater and looked faintly 

patronizing, but eager. keating had never heard the names of the others. most of them were 
beginners, young, poorly dressed and belligerent. some were only draftsmen. there was one 
woman architect who had built a few small private homes, mainly for wealthy widows; she had 
an aggressive manner, a tight mouth and a fresh petunia in her hair. there was a boy with 
pure, innocent eyes. there was an obscure contractor with a fat, expressionless face. there 
was a tall, dry woman who was an interior decorator, and another woman

with the innocent eyes pleaded that "we could do so much good..." his voice had a note of 
desperate sincerity which seemed embarrassing and out of place. gordon l. prescott 
declared that the a.g.a. was a bunch of old fogies with no conception of social responsibility 
and not a drop of virile blood in the lot of them, and that it was time to kick them in the pants 
anyway. the woman of indefinite occupation spoke about ideals and causes, though nobody 
could gather just what these were.

peter keating was elected chairman, unanimously. gordon l. prescott was elected vice-
chairman and treasurer. toohey declined all nominations. he declared that he would act only 
as an unofficial advisor. it was decided that the organization would be named the "council of 
american builders." it was decided that membership would not be restricted to architects, but 
would be open to "allied crafts" and to "all those holding the interests of the great profession of 
building at heart."

then toohey spoke. he

y activity carried a 
nobler significance. it was pleasant and it was drugging. he knew that all the others in the 
room felt it also.

"...and when our system of society collapses, the craft of builders will not be swept under, it 
will be swept up to greater prominence and greater recognition..."

the doorbell rang. then toohey's valet appeared for an instant, holding the door of the living 

room open to admit dominique francon.

by the manner in which toohey stopped, on a half-uttered word, keating knew that dominique 
had not been invited or expected. she smiled at toohey, shook her head and moved one 
hand in a gesture telling him to continue. he managed a faint bow in her direction, barely more
than a movement of his eyebrows, and went on with his speech. it was a pleasant greeting 
and its informality included the guest in the intimate brotherhood of the occasion, but it 
seemed to keating that it had come just one beat too late. he had never before seen toohey 
miss the right moment.

dominique sat down in a corner, behind the others. keating forgot to listen for a while, trying 
to attract her attention. he had to wait until her eyes had traveled thoughtfully about the room, 
from face to face, and stopped on his. he bowed and nodded vigorously, with the smile of 
greeting a private possession. she inclined her head, he saw her lashes touching her cheeks 
for an instant as her eyes closed, and then she looked at him again. she sat looking at him for 
a long moment, without smiling, as if she were rediscovering something in his face

, toohey rushed over to her.

"dominique, my dear!" he said brightly. "shall i consider myself flattered?"

"if you wish."

"had i known that you were interested, i would have sent you a very special invitation."

"but you didn't think i'd be interested?"

"no, frankly, i..."

"that was a mistake, ellsworth. you discounted my newspaperwoman's instinct. never miss a 
scoop. it's not often that one has the chance to witness the birth of a felony."

"just exactly what do you mean, dominique?" asked keating, his voice sharp.

she turned to him. "hello, peter."

"you know peter keating, of course?" toohey smiled at her.

"oh, yes. peter was in love with me once."

"you're using the wrong tense, dominique," said keating.

"you must never take seriously anything dominique chooses to say, peter. she does not 
intend us to take it seriously. would you like to join our little group, dominique? your 
professional qualifications make you eminently eligible."

"no, ellsworth. i wouldn't like to join your l

ittle group. i really don't hate you enough to do that."

"just why do you disapprove of it?" snapped keating.

"why, peter!" she drawled. "whatever gave you that idea? i don't disapprove of it at all. do i, 
ellsworth? i think it's a proper undertaking in answer to an obvious necessity. it's just what we 
all need--and deserve."

"can we count on your presence at our next meeting?" toohey asked. "it is pleasant to have 
so understanding a listener who will not be in the way at all--at our next meeting, i mean."

"no, ellsworth. thank you. it was merely curiosity. though you do have an interesting grou

you invite that man who designed the 
enright house--what's his name?--howard roark?"

keating felt his jaw snap tight. but she looked at them innocently, she had said it lightly, in the 
tone of a casual remark--surely, he thought, she did not mean...what? he asked himself and 
added: she did not mean whatever it was he'd thought for a moment she meant, whatever had 
terrified him in that moment.

"i have never had the pleasure of meeting mr. roark," toohey answered gravely.

"do you know him?" keating asked her.

"no," she answered. "i've merely seen a sketch of the enright house."

"and?" keating insisted. "what do you think of it?"

"i don't think of it," she answered.

when she turned to leave, keating accompanied her. he looked at her in the elevator, on their 
way down. he saw her hand, in a tight black glove, holding the flat corner of a pocket-book. 
the limp carelessness of her fingers was insolent and inviting at once. he felt himself 
surrendering to her again. "dominique, why did

his new home was one large room in a small, modern apartment house on a quiet street. he 
had chosen the house because it had no cornices over the windows and no paneling on the 
walls inside. his room contained a few pieces of simple furniture; it looked clean, vast and 
empty; one expected to hear echoes from its corners.

"why not go, just once?" said heller. "it won't be too awful. it might even amuse you. you'll 
see a lot of your old friends there. john erik snyte, peter keating, guy francon and his

 of guests did not dwarf her hall; it stood over 
them like a square box of space, grotesquely out of scale; and it was this wasted expanse of 
air imprisoned above them that gave the occasion an aspect of regal luxury; it was like the lid 
of a jewel case, unnecessarily large over a flat bottom holding a single small gem.

the guests moved in two broad, changing currents that drew them all, sooner or later, toward 
two whirlpools; at the center of one stood ellsworth toohey, of the other--peter keating. 
evening clothes were not becoming to ellsworth toohey; the rectangle of white shirt front 
prolonged his face, stretching him out into two dimensions; the wings of his tie made his thin 
neck look like that of a plucked chicken, pale, bluish and ready to be twisted by a single 
movement of some strong fist. but he wore his clothes better than any man present. he wore 
them with the careless impertinence of utter ease in the unbecoming, and the very 
grotesqueness of his appearance became a de

he was saying to a millionaire's widow: "yes, i do think it would be a good idea if you made a 
contribution to the workshop of social study. it would be a way of taking part in the great 
human stream of cultural achievement, without upsetting your routine or your digestion."

those around him were saying: "isn't he witty? and such courage!"

peter keating smiled radiantly. he felt the attention and admiration flowing toward him from 
every part of the ballroom. he looked at the people, all these trim, perfumed, silk-rustling 
people lacquered with light, dripping with light, as they had all been dripping with shower water 
a few hours ago, getting ready to come here and stand in homage before a man named peter 
keating. there were moments when he forgot that he was peter keating and he glanced at a

once the current left him face to face with ellsworth toohey. keating smiled like a boy 
emerging from a stream on a summer day, glowing, invigorated, restless with energy. toohey 
stood looking at him; toohey's hands had slipped negligently into his trouser pockets, making 
his jacket flare out over his thin hips; he seemed to teeter faintly on his small feet; his eyes 
were attentive in enigmatic appraisal.

"now this, ellsworth...this...isn't it a wonderful evening?" said keating, like a child to a mother 
who would understand, and a little like a drunk.

keating winced. he wondered when and how toohey had had the time to notice that.

"oh, well," said toohey, "the exception proves the rule. regrettable, however. i've always had 
the absurd idea that it would take a most unusual man to attract dominique francon. so of 
course i thought of you. just an idle thought. still, you know, the man who'll get her will have 
something you won't be able to match. he'll beat you there."

"no one's got her," snapped keating.

"no, undoubtedly not. not yet. that's rather astonishing. oh, i suppose it will take an 
extraordinary kind of man."

"look here, what in hell are you doing? you don't like dominique francon. do you?"

"i never said i did."

a little later keating heard toohey saying solemnly in the midst of some earnest discussion: 
"happiness? but that is so middle-class. what is happiness? there are so many things in life 
so much more important than happiness."

keating made his way slowly toward dominiqu

when joel sutton left him, roark heard a bright voice saying: "congratulations, howard," and

"ellsworth!" she screamed. "get out of here!"

she had shot to her feet. she stood straight for a moment, then she slumped forward, her two 
palms flat on the desk, and she stood, bent over; he saw her smooth mass of hair swinging 
heavily, then hanging still, hiding her face.

"but, dominique," he said pleasantly, "i was only telling you why peter keating is such an 
interesting person."

her hair flew back like a mop, and her face followed, she dropped down on her chair, looking 
at him, her mouth loose and very ugly.

"dominique," he said softly, "you're obvious. much too obvious."

"get out of here."

"well, i've always said that you underestimated me. call on me next time you need some 
help."

at the door, he turned to add:

"of course, personally, i think peter keating is the greatest architect we've got."

that evening, when she came home, the telephone rang.

"well, what architect would you recommend?"

"think, joel. who is there, at the moment, that everybody's talking about? who gets the pick

it disturbed mr. sutton that roark did not protest. he wished roark would try to argue; then he 
could bring forth the unanswerable justifications which dominique had taught him a few hours 
ago. but roark said nothing; he had merely inclined his head when he heard the decision. mr. 
sutton wanted desperately to utter the justifications, but it seemed pointless to try to convince

"well, my two explanations, for instance. there's an interesting question there. what is 
kinder--to believe the best of people and burden them with a nobility beyond their endurance--
or to see them as they are, and accept it because it makes them comfortable? kindness being 
more important than justice, of course."

"i don't give a damn, ellsworth."

"not in a mood for abstract speculation? interested only in concrete results? all right. how 
many commissions have you landed for peter keating in the last three months?"

she rose, walked to the tray which the maid had left, poured herself a drink, and said: "four," 
raising the glass to her mouth. then she turned to look at him, standing, glass in hand, and 
added: "and that was the famous toohey technique. never place your punch at the beginning 
of a column nor at the end. sneak it in where it's least expected. fill a whole column with 
drivel, just to get in that one important line."

he bowed courteously. "quite. that's why i lik

and vicious with people who don't even know that you're being subtle and vicious. but the

becoming obvious. i will have to think of a new one."

"don't bother. they love it."

"of course. they'll love anything i write. so it's four? i missed one. i counted three."

"i can't understand why you had to come here if that's all you wanted to know. you're so fond 
of peter keating, and i'm helping him along beautifully, better than you could, so if you wanted 
to give me a pep talk about petey--it wasn't necessary, was it?"

"you're wrong there twice in one sentence, dominique. one honest error and one lie. the 
honest error is the assumption that i wish to help petey keating--and, incidentally, i can help 
him much better than you can, and i have and will, but that's long-range contemplation. the lie 
is that i came here to talk about peter keating--you knew what i came

he made a grimace, wrinkling his nose: "oh, no. he's not big enough for that. but let's talk 
about peter keating. it's such a convenient coincidence that he happens to be your father's 
partner. you're merely working your head off to procure commissions for your father, like a

"oh, it could have been a number of things--a preliminary feeler, for instance. but, as a matter

being understood. not by you."

"i need you?"

"oh, come on, show a little courage, too."

she sat up and waited coldly, silently. he smiled, obviously with pleasure, making no effort to 
hide the pleasure.

"let's see," he said, studying the ceiling with casual attention, "those commissions you got for 
peter keating. the cryon office building was mere nuisance value--howard roark never had 
a chance at that. the lindsay home was better--roark was definitely considered, i think he 
would have got it but for you. the stonebrook clubhouse also--he had a chance at that, which 
you ruined." he looked at her and chuckled softly. "no comments on techniques and punches,

by an unfinished drawing.

"roark," she said, standing behind his chair, her arms over his shoulders, her hand under his

they had a silent agreement, understood without mention, never to be seen together. her 
bedroom was an exquisite place of glass and pale ice-green. he liked to come in wearing 
clothes stained by a day spent on the construction site. he liked to throw back the covers of 
her bed, then to sit talking quietly for an hour or two, not looking at the bed, not mentioning her 
writing or buildings or the latest commission she had obtained for peter keating, the simplicity 
of being at ease, here, like this, making the hours more sensual than the moments they 
delayed.

there were evenings when they sat together in her living room, at the huge window high over 
the city. she liked to see him at that window. he would stand, half turned to her, smoking, 
looking at the city below. she would move away from him and sit down on the floor in the 
middle of the room and watch him.

peter keating was bewildered. dominique's sudden devotion to his career seemed dazzling, 
flattering, enormously profitable; everybody told him so; but there were moments when he did 
not feel dazzled or flattered; he felt uneasy.

he tried to avoid guy francon. "how did you do it, peter? how did you do it?" francon would 
ask. "she must be crazy about you! who'd every think that dominique of all people would...? 
and who'd think she could? she'd have made me a millionaire if she'd done her stuff five

 ago. but then, of course, a father is not the same inspiration as a..." he caught an 
ominous look on keating's face and changed the end of his sentence to: "as her man, shall 
we say?"

"listen, guy," keating began, and stopped, sighing, and muttered: "please, guy, we 
mustn't..."

"i know, i know, i know. we mustn't be premature. but hell, peter, entre nous, isn't it all as 

public as an engagement? more so. and louder." then the smile vanished, and francon's 
face looked earnest, peaceful, frankly aged, in one of his rare flashes of genuine dignity. "and 
i'm glad, peter," he said simply. "that's what i wanted to happen. i guess i always did love 
dominique, after all. it makes me happy. i know

paradox. let us be modest in the vast pride of this 
realization. everything else is twaddle."

one could not worry about one's value or greatness when listening to this. it made self-
respect unnecessary.

keating listened in thick contentment. he glanced at the others. there was an attentive 
silence in the audience; they all liked it as he liked it. he saw a boy chewing gum, a man 
cleaning his fingernails with the corner of a match folder, a youth stretched out loutishly. that, 
too, pleased keating; it was as if they said: we are glad to listen to the sublime, but it's not 
necessary to be too damn reverent about the sublime.

the council of american builders met once a month and engaged in no tangible activity, 
beyond listening to speeches and sipping an inferior brand of root beer. its membership did 
not grow fast either in quantity or in quality. there were no concrete results achieved.

the meetings of the council were held in a huge, empty room over a garage on the west 
side. a lo

ng, narrow, unventilated stairway led to a door bearing the council's name; there 
were folding chairs inside, a table for the chairman, and a wastebasket. the a.g.a. 
considered the council of american builders a silly joke. "why do you want to waste time on 
those cranks for?"

francon asked keating in the rose-lit satin-stuffed rooms of the a.g.a., wrinkling his nose with 
fastidious amusement. "damned if i know," keating answered gaily. "i like them." ellsworth 
toohey attended every meeting of the council, but did not speak. he sat in a corner and 
listened.

one night keating and toohey walked home together after the meeting, down the dark, 
shabby streets of the west side, and stopped for a cup of coffee at a seedy drugstore. "why 
not a drugstore?" toohey laughed when keating reminded him of the distinguished 
restaurants made famous by toohey's patronage. "at least, no one will recognize us here and

he sent a jet of smoke from his egyptian cigarette at a faded coca-cola sign over their booth, 
he ordered a sandwich, he nibbled daintily a slice of pickle which was not flyspecked but 
looked it, and he talked to keating. he talked at random. what he said did not matter, at first; 
it was his voice, the matchless voice of ellsworth toohey. keating felt as if he were standing in 
the middle of a vast plain, under the stars, held and owned, in assurance, in security.

"kindness, peter," said the voice softly, "kindness. that is the first commandment, perhaps 
the only one. that is why i had to pan that new play, in my column yesterday. that play lacked

t. there were no 
alternatives, no mitigating considerations. but if a man worked well, he needed nothing else to 
win his employer's benevolence: it was granted, not as a gift, but as a debt. it was granted, not 
as affection, but as recognition. it bred an immense feeling of self-respect within every man in 
that office.

"oh, but that's not human," said somebody when one of roark's draftsmen tried to explain this 
at home, "such a cold, intellectual approach!" one boy, a younger sort of peter keating, tried 
to introduce the human in preference to the intellectual in roark's office; he did not last two 
weeks. roark made mistakes in choosing his employees occasionally, not often; those whom 
he kept for a month became his friends for life. they did not call themselves friends; they did 
not praise him to outsiders; they did not talk about him. they knew only, in a dim way, that it

f history. but the things he fought were 
not solid enough to leave anything as substantial as corpses on the battlefield.

he had to fight phenomena such as: "listen, palmer, lansing's talking about somebody 
named roark, how're you going to vote, do the big boys approve of him or not?"

"i'm not going to decide till i know who's voted for or against."

"lansing says...but on the other hand, thorpe tells me..."talbot's putting up a swank hotel on 
fifth up in the sixties--and he's got francon & keating." "harper swears by this young fellow--
gordon prescott." "listen, betsy says we're crazy." "i don't like roark's face--he doesn't look 
co-operative." "i know, i feel it, roark's the kind that don't fit in. he's not a regular fellow."

"what's a regular fellow?"

"aw hell, you know very well what i mean: regular."

"thompson says that mrs. pritchett says that she knows for certain because mr. macy told her 
that if..."

"well, boys, i don't give a damn what anybody says, i make up my own mind,

"you've always been, my dear. do forgive me. i should have known better than to be 
astonished. it would make you happy, of course, that he got it. i don't even mind admitting that 
it doesn't make me happy at all. there, you see? now your visit to my office has been a 
complete success. so we shall just write the aquitania off as a major defeat, forget all about it 
and continue as we were."

"certainly, ellsworth. just as we were. i'm cinching a beautiful new hospital for peter keating 
at a dinner party tonight."

ellsworth toohey went home and spent the evening thinking about hopton stoddard.

hopton stoddard was a little man worth twenty million dollars. three inheritances had 
contributed to that sum, and seventy-two years of a busy life devoted to the purpose of making
money. hopton stoddard had a genius for investment; he invested in everything--houses of ill 
fame, broadway spectacles on the grand scale, preferably of a religious nature, factories, 
farm mortgages and

shall have done mine. do not worry about the meaning i wish conveyed. let it be your spirit in 
the shape of a building--and it will have that meaning, whether you know it or not."

and so roark agreed to build the stoddard temple of the human spirit.

11.

in december the cosmo-slotnick building was opened with great ceremony. there were 
celebrities, flower horseshoes, newsreel cameras, revolving searchlights and three hours of 
speeches, all alike.

i should be happy, peter keating told himself--and wasn't. he watched from a window the 
solid spread of faces filling broadway from curb to curb. he tried to talk himself into joy. he felt 
nothing. he had to admit that he was bored. but he smiled and shook hands and let himself 
be photographed. the cosmo-slotnick building rose ponderously over the street, like a big 
white bromide.

after the ceremonies ellsworth toohey took keating away to the retreat of a pale-orchid booth 
in a quiet, expensive restaurant. many brilliant

 parties were being given in honor of the 
opening, but keating grasped toohey's offer and declined all the other invitations. toohey 

watched him as he seized his drink and slumped in his seat.

"wasn't it grand?" said toohey. 'that, peter, is the climax of what you can expect from life." 
he lifted his glass delicately. "here's to the hope that you shall have many triumphs such as 
this. such as tonight."

"thanks," said keating, and reached for his glass hastily, without looking, and lifted it, to find it 
empty.

"don't you feel proud, peter?"

"yes. yes, of course."

"that's good. that's how i like to see you. you looked extremely handsome tonight. you'll be 
splendid in those newsreels."

a flicker of interest snapped in keating's eyes. "well, i sure hope so."

"it's too bad you're not married, peter. a wife would have been most decorative tonight. goes 
well with the public. with the movie audiences, too."

"katie

ure by your side."

"who?"

"oh, don't pay attention to me. it's only an esthetic fancy. life is never as perfect as that. 
people have too much to envy you for. you couldn't add that to your other achievements."

"who?"

"drop it, peter. you can't get her. nobody can get her. you're good, but you're not good 
enough for that."

"who?"

"dominique francon, of course."

keating sat up straight and toohey saw wariness in his eyes, rebellion, actual hostility. toohey 
held his glance calmly. it was keating who gave in; he slumped again and he said, pleading:

"oh, god, ellsworth, i don't love her."

"i never thought you did. but i do keep forgetting the exaggerated importance which the 
average man attaches to love--sexual love."

"i'm not an average man," said keating wearily; it was an automatic protest--without fire.

"sit up, peter. you don't look like a hero, slumped that way."

keating jerked himself up--anxious and angry. he said:

"i've always felt that you wanted me to marry dominique. w

that one must mistrust one's most personal 
impulses. what one desires is actually of so little importance! one can't expect to find 
happiness until one realizes this completely. think of tonight for a moment. you, my dear 
peter, were the least important person there. which is as it should be. it is not the doer that 
counts but those for whom things are done. but you were not able to accept that--and so you 
didn't feel the great elation that should have been yours."

"that's true," whispered keating. he would not have admitted it to anyone else.

"you missed the beautiful pride of utter selflessness. only when you learn to deny your ego, 
completely, only when you learn to be amused by such piddling sentimentalities as your little 
sex urges--only then will you achieve the greatness which i have always expected of you."

"you...you believe that about me, ellsworth? you really do?"

"i wouldn't be sitting here if i didn't. but to come back to love. personal love, peter, is a great 
evil--as

 everything personal. and it always leads to misery. don't you see why? personal love 
is an act of discrimination, of preference. it is an act of injustice--to every human being on 
earth whom you rob of the affection arbitrarily granted to one. you must love all men equally. 
but you cannot achieve so noble an emotion if you don't kill your selfish little choices. they are 
vicious and futile--since they contradict the first cosmic law--the basic equality of all men."

"you mean," said keating, suddenly interested, "that in a...in a philosophical way, deep down, i 
mean, we're all equal? all of us?"

"of course," said toohey.

keating wondered why the thought was so warmly pleasant to him. he did not mind that this 
made him the equal of every pickpocket in the crowd gathered to celebrate his building 
tonight; it occurred to him dimly--and left him undisturbed, even though it contradicted the 
passionate quest for superiority that had driven him all his life. the contradiction did n

that winter the annual costume arts ball was an event of greater brilliance and originality than 
usual. athelstan beasely, the leading spirit of its organization, had had what he called a stroke 
of genius: all the architects were invited to come dressed as their best buildings. it was a huge 
success.

peter keating was the star of the evening. he looked wonderful as the cosmo-slotnick 
building. an exact papier-mâché replica of his famous structure covered him from head to 
knees; one could not see his face, but his bright eyes peered from behind the windows of the 
top floor, and the crowning pyramid of the roof rose over his head; the colonnade hit him 
somewhere about the diaphragm, and he wagged a finger through the portals of the great 
entrance door. his legs were free to move with his usual elega

d of it.

"listen, dominique," he said angrily, "there is a limit. there really is a limit--even for you. why 
are you doing it? why--for a building of roark's of all things? after everything you've said and 
done against him--do you wonder people are talking? nobody'd care or notice if it were 
anyone else. but you--and roark! i can't go anywhere without having somebody ask me about 
it. what am i to do?"

"order yourself a reproduction of the statue, father. it's going to be beautiful."

peter keating refused to discuss it. but he met dominique at a party and he asked, having 
intended not to ask it:

"is it true that you're posing for a statue for roark's temple?"

"yes."

"dominique, i don't like it."

"no?"

"oh, i'm sorry. i know i have no right...it's only...it's only that of all people, i don't want to see 
you being friendly with roark. not roark. anybody but roark."

she looked interested: "why?"

"i don't know."

her glance of curious study worried him.

"maybe," he muttered, "mayb

d. order was restored, but not to the faces of the crowd: 
the faces remained lecherously self-righteous. it was pleasant to be singled out and brought 
into the case as an injured party. three-fourths of them had never seen the stoddard temple.

"thank you, mr. toohey," said the attorney, faintly suggesting a bow. then he turned to roark 
and said with delicate courtesy: "your witness."

"no questions," said roark.

ellsworth toohey raised one eyebrow and left the stand regretfully.

"mr. peter keating!" called the attorney. peter keating's face looked attractive and fresh, as if 
he had had a good night's sleep. he mounted the witness stand with a collegiate sort of gusto, 
swinging his shoulders and arms unnecessarily. he took the oath and answered the first 
questions gaily. his pose in the witness chair was strange: his torso slumped to one side with 
swaggering ease, an elbow on the chair's arm; but his feet were planted awkwardly straight, 
and his knees were pressed tight together. he

never looked at roark.

"will you please name some of the outstanding buildings which you have designed, mr. 
keating?" the attorney asked.

keating began a list of impressive names; the first few came fast, the rest slower and slower, 
as if he wished to be stopped; the last one died in the air, unfinished.

"aren't you forgetting the most important one, mr. keating?" the attorney asked. "didn't you 
design the cosmo-slotnick building?"

"yes," whispered keating.

"now, mr. keating, you attended the stanton institute of technology at the same period as mr. 

roark?"

"yes."

"what can you tell us about mr. roark's record there?"

"he was expelled."

"he was expelled because he was unable to live up to the institute's high standard of 
requirements?"

"yes. yes, that was it."

the judge glanced at roark. a lawyer would have objected to this testimony as irrelevant. 
roark made no objection.

"at that time, did you think that he showed any talent for the profession of arch

itecture?"

"no."

"will you please speak a little louder, mr. keating?"

"i didn't...think he had any talent."

queer things were happening to keating's verbal punctuation: some words came out crisply, 
as if he dropped an exclamation point after each; others ran together, as if he would not stop 
to let himself hear them. he did not look at the attorney. he kept his eyes on the audience. at 
times, he looked like a boy out on a lark, a boy who has just drawn a mustache on the face of 
a beautiful girl on a subway toothpaste ad. then he looked as if he were begging the crowd for 
support--as if he were on trial before them.

"at one time you

enough to...respect you a little just the same. i don't see what's so wrong with trying to please 
people. i don't see what's wrong with wanting to be friendly and liked and popular. why is that 
a crime? why should anyone sneer at you for that, sneer all the time, all the time, day and 
night, not giving you a moment's peace, like the chinese water torture, you know where they 
drop water on your skull drop by drop?"

people in the audience began to realize that peter keating was drunk. the attorney frowned; 
the testimony had been rehearsed; but it was getting off the rails.

"well, now, mr. keating, perhaps you'd better tell us about mr. roark's views on architecture."

"i'll tell you, if you want to know. he thinks you should take your shoes off and kneel, when you 
speak of architecture. that's what he thinks. now why should you? why? it's a business like 
any other, isn't it? what's so damn sacred about it? why do we have to be all keyed up? 
we're only human.

we have to be some sort of god-damn heroes?"

"now, now, mr. keating, i think we're straying slightly from the subject. we're..."

"no, we're not. i know what i'm talking about. you do, too. they all do. every one of them 
here. i'm talking about the temple. don't you see? why pick a fiend to build a temple? only a 
very human sort of man should be chosen to do that. a man who understands...and forgives. 
a man who forgives...that's what you go to church for--to be...forgiven..."

"yes, mr. keating, but speaking of mr. roark..."

"well, what about mr. roark? he'

"mr. keating, if you're not well and wish to be dismissed...?" keating looked at him, as if 
awakening. he tried to control himself. after a while he said, his voice flat, resigned:

"no. i'm all right. i'll tell you anything you want. what is it you want me to say?"

"will you tell us--in professional terms--your opinion of the structure known as the stoddard 
temple?"

"yes. sure. the stoddard temple...the stoddard temple has an improperly articulated plan, 
which leads to spatial confusion. there is no balance of masses. it lacks a sense of 
symmetry. its propo

making an effort not to let it drop forward. "it's out of scale. it contradicts the elementary 
principles of composition. the total effect is that of..."

"louder please, mr. keating."

"the total effect is that of crudeness and architectural illiteracy. it shows...it shows no sense of 
structure, no instinct for beauty, no creative imagination, no..." he closed his eyes, "...artistic 
integrity..."

"thank you, mr. keating. that is all."

the attorney turned to roark and said nervously:

"your witness."

"no questions," said roark.

this concluded the first day of the trial.

that evening mallory, heller, mike, enright and lansing gathered in roark's room. they had 
not consulted one another, but they all came, prompted by the same feeling. they did not talk 
about the trial, but there was no strain and no conscious avoidance of the subject. roark sat 
on his drafting table and talked to them about the future of

laughed aloud suddenly, without apparent reason. "what's the matter, steve?" roark asked. "i 
just thought...howard, we all came here to help you, to cheer you up. but it's you who're 
helping us, instead. you're supporting your supporters, howard."

that evening, peter keating lay half-stretched across a table in a speakeasy, one arm 
extending along the table top, his face on his arm.

in the next two days a succession of witnesses testified for the plaintiff. every examination 
began with questions that brought out the professional achievements of the witness. the 
attorney gave them leads like an expert press agent. austen heller remarked that architects 
must have fought for the privilege of being called to the witness stand, since it was the

part of its site. in what kind of world did roark build his temple? for what kind of men? look 
around you. can you see a shrine becoming sacred by serving as a setting for mr. hopton 
stoddard? for mr. ralston holcombe? for mr. peter keating? when you look at them all, do 
you hate ellsworth toohey--or do you damn howard roark for the unspeakable indignity 
which he did commit? ellsworth toohey is right, that temple is a sacrilege, though not in the 
sense he meant. i think mr. toohey knows that, however. when you see a man casting pearls 
without getting even a pork chop in return--it is not against the swine that you feel indignation.

when the doorbell rang on the following evening toohey went to open the door himself.

he smiled when he admitted peter keating. after the trial he had expected keating to come to 
him; he knew that keating would need to come. but he had expected him sooner.

keating walked in uncertainly. his hands seemed too heavy for his wrists. his eyes were 
puffed, and the skin of his face looked slack.

"hello, peter," said toohey brightly. "want to see me? come right in. just your luck. i have 
the whole evening free."

"no," said keating. "i want to see katie."

he was not looking at toohey and he did not see the expression beh

g after him, his face thoughtful.

catherine jumped to her feet when she saw her guest. she stood stupidly, incredulously for a 
moment, then she dashed to her bed to snatch a girdle she had left lying there and stuff it 
hurriedly under the pillow. then she jerked off her glasses, closed her whole fist over them, 
and slipped them into her pocket. she wondered which would be worse: to remain as she was 
or to sit down at her dressing table and make up her face in his presence.

she had not seen keating for six months. in the last three years, they had met occasionally, at 
long intervals, they had had a few luncheons together, a few dinners, they had gone to the 
movies twice. they had always met in a public place. since the beginning of his acquaintance 
with toohey, keating would not come to see her at her home. when they met, they talked as 
if nothing had changed. but they had not spoken of marriage for a long time. "hello, katie," 
said keating softly. "i didn't know you wore glasses now

start then."

"yes, peter."

after he had gone, she lay on her bed, sobbing aloud, without restraint, without dignity, without 
a care in the world.

ellsworth toohey had left the door of his study open. he had seen keating pass by the door 
without noticing it and go out. then he heard the sound of catherine's sobs. he walked to her 
room and entered without knocking. he asked:

"what's the matter, my dear? has peter done something to hurt you?"

she half lifted herself on the bed, she looked at him, throwing her hair back off her face, 
sobbing exultantly. she said without thinking the first thing she felt like saying. she said 

something which she did not understand, but he did: "i'm not afraid of you, uncle

"who?" gasped keating.

"miss dominique francon," the maid repeated.

"you're drunk, you damn fool!"

"mr. keating!..."

he was on his feet, he shoved her out of the way, he flew into the living room, and saw 
dominique francon standing there, in his apartment.

"hello, peter."

"dominique!...dominique, how come?" in his anger, apprehension, curiosity and flattered 
pleasure, his first conscious thought was gratitude to god that his mother was not at home.

"i phoned your office. they said you had gone home."

"i'm so delighted, so pleasantly sur...oh, hell, dominique, what's the use? i always try to be

without shifting the positions of their 
bodies, when the car stopped for a light. they seemed caught in a single streak of motion, an 
imperative direction like the flight of a bullet that could not be stopped on its course. there 
was a first hint of twilight in the streets of the city. the pavements looked yellow. the shops 
were still open. a movie theater had lighted its sign, and the red bulbs whirled jerkily, sucking 
the last daylight out of the air, making the street look darker.

peter keating felt no need of speech. he did not seem to be peter keating any longer. he did 
not ask for warmth and he did not ask for pity. he asked nothing. she thought of that once, 
and she glanced at him, a glance of appreciation that was almost gentle. he met her eyes 
steadily; she saw understanding, but no comment. it was as if his glance said: "of course," 
nothing else.

they were out of the city, with a cold brown road flying to meet them, when he said:

"the traffic cops are bad around here. got

n, and said, "here it is," when they pulled up in front of the judge's house. he 
got out first and helped her out of the car. he pressed the button of the doorbell.

they were married in a living room that displayed armchairs of faded tapestry, blue and 
purple, and a lamp with a fringe of glass beads. the witnesses were the judge's wife and 
someone from next door named chuck, who had been interrupted at some household task 
and smelled faintly of clorox.

then they came back to their car and keating asked: "want me to drive if you're tired?" she 
said: "no, i'll drive."

the road to the city cut through brown fields where every rise in the ground had a shade of 
tired red on the side facing west. there was a purple haze eating away the edges of the fields, 
and a motionless streak of fire in the sky. a few cars came toward them as brown shapes, still 
visible; others had their lights on, two disquieting spots of yellow.

keating watched the road; it looked narrow, a small dash in the middl

hore, only lasting and hopeless and vicious. my wife, he thought for the first time, without a 
trace of respect in the word. he felt so violent a desire that had it been summer he would have 
ordered her to drive into the first side lane and he would have taken her there.

he slipped his arm along the back of the seat and encircled her shoulders, his fingers barely 
touching her. she did not move, resist or turn to look at him. he pulled his arm away, and he 
sat staring straight ahead.

"mrs. keating," he said flatly, not addressing her, just as a statement of fact.

"mrs. peter keating," she said.

when they stopped in front of his apartment house, he got out and held the door for her, but 
she remained sitting behind the wheel.

"good night, peter," she said. "i'll see you tomorrow."

she added, before the expression of his face had turned into an obscene swearword: "i'll send 
my things over tomorrow and we'll discuss everything then. everything will begin tomorrow, 
peter."

 end of the room, his back turned to her for a moment, when she said, 
"roark," her voice quiet and low.

he turned to her, as if he had expected it and, perhaps, guessed the rest.

she stood in the middle of the floor, as she had stood on her first night in this room, solemnly 
composed to the performance of a rite.

"i love you, roark."

she had said it for the first time.

she saw the reflection of her next words on his face before she had pronounced them.

"i was married yesterday. to peter keating."

it would have been easy, if she had seen a man distorting his mouth to bite off sound, closing 
his fists and twisting them in defense against himself. but it was not easy, because she did not 
see him doing this, yet knew that this was being done, without the relief of a physical gesture.

"roark..." she whispered, gently, frightened.

he said: "i'm all right." then he said: "please wait a moment...all right. go on."

"roark, before i met you, i had always been afraid of seeing someone like

exists--and you. it would mean to struggle against things and men who don't deserve to be 
your opponents. your fight, using their methods--and that's too horrible a desecration. it would 
mean doing for you what i did for peter keating: lie, flatter, evade, compromise, pander to 
every ineptitude--in order to beg of them a chance for you, beg them to let you live, to let you 
function, to beg them, roark, not to laugh at them, but to tremble because they hold the power

he looked at her, waiting. she knew th

"you're not aware of them. i am. i can't help it, i love you. the contrast is too great. roark, you

where nothing can touch it, kept sacred by the protecting wall of my own degradation, there 
will be the thought of you and the knowledge of you, and i shall say 'howard roark to myself 
once in a while, and i shall feel that i have deserved to say it." she stood before him, her face 
raised; her lips were not drawn, but closed softly, yet the shape of her mouth was too definite 
on her face, a shape of pain and tenderness, and resignation.

then he kissed her and let her go.

15.

at nine o'clock that morning peter keating was pacing the floor of his room, his door 
locked. he forgot that it was nine o'clock and that catherine was waiting for him. he had made 
himself forget her and everything she implied.

the door of his room was locked to protect him from his mother. last night, seeing his furious 
restlessness, she had forced him to tell her the truth. he had snapped that he was married to 
dominique francon, and he had added some sort of explanation about dominique going out 
of town to announce the marriage

morning.

he had forbidden his mother to announce the news, but she had made a few telephone calls 
last night, and she was making a few more this morning, and now their telephone was ringing 
constantly, with eager voices asking: "is it true?" pouring out sounds of amazement and 
congratulations. keating could see the news spreading through the city in widening circles, by 
the names and social positions of the people who called. he refused to answer the telephone. 

it seemed to him that every corner of new york was flooded with celebration and that he 
alone, hidden in the watertight caisson of his room, was cold and lost and horrified.

it was almost noon when the doorbell rang, and he pressed his hands to his ears, not to know 
who it was and what they wanted. then he heard his mother's vo

he said: "dominique my dear, this is like a dream come true!"

the dignity of their doomed understanding was gone and their marriage was what it had been 
intended to be.

she seemed glad of it. she said: "sorry you didn't carry me over the threshold, peter." he did 
not kiss her, but took her hand and kissed her arm above the wrist, in casual, intimate 
tenderness.

he saw his mother standing there, and he said with a dashing gesture of triumph: "mother--
dominique keating."

he saw his mother kissing her. dominique returned the kiss gravely. mrs. keating was 
gulping: "my dear, i'm so happy, so happy, god bless you, i had no idea you were so 
beautiful!"

he did not know what to do next, but dominique took charge, simply, leaving them no time for 
wonder. she walked into the living room and she said: "let's have lunch first, and then you'll 
show me the place, peter. my things will be here in an hour or so."

mrs. keating beamed: "lunch is all ready for three, m

am i to call you, honey? mrs. keating or..."

"dominique, of course," dominique answered without smiling.

"aren't we going to announce, to invite anyone, to...?" keating began, but dominique said:

"afterwards, peter. it will announce itself."

later, when her luggage arrived, he saw her walking into his bedroom without hesitation. she 
instructed the maid how to hang up her clothes, she asked him to help her rearrange the 
contents of the closets.

mrs. keating looked puzzled. "but aren't you children going to go away at all? it's all so sudden
and romantic, but--no honeymoon of any kind?"

"no," said dominique, "i don't want to take peter away from his work."

he said: "this is temporary of course, dominique. we'll have to move to another apartment, a 
bigger one. i want you to choose it."

"why, no," she said. "i don't think that's necessary. we'll remain here."

"i'll move out," mrs. keating offered generously, without thinking, prompted by an 
overwhelming fear of dominique. "i'll take a little place for myself."

"no," said dominique. "i'd rather you wouldn't. i want to change nothing. i want to fit myself 
into peter's life just as it is."

"that's sweet of you!" mrs. keating smiled, while keating thought numbly that it was not sweet 

of her at all.

mrs. keating knew that when she had recovered she would hate her daughter-in-law. she 
could have accepted snubbing. she could n

the telephone rang. keating's chief designer at the office delivered his congratulations and 
said: "we just heard it, peter, and guy's pretty stunned. i really think you ought to call him up 
or come over here or something."

keating hurried to the office, glad to escape from his house for a while. he entered the office 
like a perfect figure of a radiant young lover. he laughed and shook hands in the drafting 
room, through noisy congratulations, gay shouts of envy and a few smutty references. then 
he hastened to franc

"i don't mean that. i mean--why don't you look happy when i say that it will be yours? i...i'd like 
you to be happy about that, peter."

"for god's sake, guy, you're being morbid, you're..."

"well, who wouldn't be?" he did not look at francon. he could not stand the sound of pleading 
in francon's voice.

"yes, who wouldn't be? of course....and you are, peter?"

"what do you want?" snapped keating angrily.

"i want you to feel proud of me, peter," said francon humbly, simply, desperately. "i want to 
know that i've accomplished something. i want to feel that it had some meaning. at the last 
summing up, i want to be sure that it wasn't all--for nothing."

"you're not sure of that? you're not sure?" keating's eyes were murderous, as if francon were 
a sudden danger to him.

"what's the matter, peter?" francon asked gently, almost indifferently.

"god damn you, you have no right--not to be

out the one thing that could hurt most, forgetting that it hurt him, not francon, that francon 
wouldn't know, had never known, wouldn't even guess: "well, i know somebody who'll be 
sure, at the end of his life, who'll be so god-damn sure i'd like to cut his damn throat for it!"

"who?" asked francon quietly, without interest. "guy! guy, what's the matter with us? what 
are we talking about?"

"i don't know," said francon. he looked tired.

that evening francon came to keating's house for dinner. he was dressed jauntily, and he 
twinkled with his old gallantry as he kissed mrs. keating's hand. but he looked grave when he 
congratulated dominique and he found little to say to her; there was a pleading look in his 
eyes when he glanced up at her face. instead of the bright, cutting mockery he had expected 
from her, he saw a sudden understanding. she said nothing, but bent down and kissed him on 
the forehead and held her lips pressed gently to his head a second longer

required. he felt a warm flood of gratitude--and then he felt frightened. "dominique," he 
whispered--the others could not hear him--"how terribly unhappy you must be...." she laughed 
gaily, taking his arm: "why, no, father, how can you say that!"

"forgive me," he muttered, "i'm just stupid....this is really wonderful...."

guests kept coming in all evening, uninvited and unannounced, anyone who had heard the 
news and felt privileged to drop in. keating did not know whether he was glad to see them or 
not. it seemed all right, so long as the gay confusion lasted. dominique behaved exquisitely. 
he did not catch a single hint of sarcasm in her manner.

it was late when the last guest departed and they were left alone among the filled ash trays 
and empty glasses. they sat at opposite ends of the living room, and keating tried to 
postpone the moment of thinking what he had to think now.

"all right, peter," said dominique, rising, "let's get it

"as often or as seldom as you wish, peter."

next morning, entering the dining room for breakfast, dominique found a florist's box, long 
and white, resting across her plate.

"what's that?" she asked the maid.

"it was brought this morning, madam, with instructions to be put on the breakfast table."

the box was addressed to mrs. peter keating. dominique opened it. it contained a few 
branches of white lilac, more extravagantly luxurious than orchids at this time of the year. 
there was a small card with a name written upon it in large letters that still held the quality of a 
hand's dashing movement, as if the letters were laughing on the pasteboard: "ellsworth m. 
toohey."

"how nice!" said keating. "i wondered why we hadn't heard from him at all yesterday."

"please put them in water, mary," said dominique, handing the box to the

maid.

in the afternoon dominique telephoned toohey and invited him for dinner.

the dinner took place a few days later. keating's mother had pleaded some previous 
engagement and escaped for the evening; she explained it to herself by believing that she 
merely needed time to get used to things. so there were only three places set on the dining-
room table, candles in crystal holders, a centerpiece of blue flowers and glass bubbles.

when toohey entered he bowed to his hosts in a manner proper to a court reception. 
dominique looked like a society hostess who had always been a society hostess and could 
not possibly be

imagined as anything else.

"well, ellsworth? well?" keating asked, with a gesture that included the hall, the air and 
dominique.

"my dear peter," said toohey, "let's skip the obvious."

dominique led the way into the living room. she wore a dinner dress--a white satin blouse 
tailored like a man's, and a long black skirt, straight and simple as the polished planes of her 
hair. the narrow band of the skirt about her waistline seemed to state that two hands could 
encircle her waist completely or snap her figure in half without much effort. the short s

left her arms bare, and she wore a plain gold bracelet, too large and heavy for her thin wrist. 
she had an appearance of elegance become perversion, an appearance of wise, dangerous 
maturity achieved by looking like a very young girl.

"ellsworth, isn't it wonderful?" said keating, watching dominique as one watches a fat bank 
account. "no less than i expected," said toohey. "and no more." at the dinner table keating 
did most of the talking. he seemed possessed by a talking jag. he turned over words with the 
sensuous abandon of a cat rolling in catnip.

"actually, ellsworth, it was dominique who invited you. i didn't ask her to. you're our first 
formal guest. i think that's wonderful. my wife and my best friend. i've always had the silly idea 
that you two didn't like each other. god knows where i get those notions. but this is what 
makes me so damn happy--the three of us, together."

"then you don't be

certain figures in combination have to give certain results. granting three entities such as 
dominique, you and i--this had to be the inevitable sum."

"they say three's a crowd," laughed keating. "but that's bosh. two are better than one, and 
sometimes three are better than two, it all depends."

"the only thing wrong with that old cliché," said toohey, "is the erroneous implication that 'a 
crowd' is a term of opprobrium. it is quite the opposite. as you are so merrily discovering. 
three, i might add, is a mystic key number. as for instance, the holy trinity. or the triangle,

they were finishing dessert when keating was called to the telephone. they could hear his 

impatient voice in the next room, snapping instructions to a draftsman who was working late 
on a rush job and needed help. toohey turned, looked at dominique and smiled. the smile 
said everything her manner had not allowed to be said earlier. there was no visible movement 
on her face, as she held his glance, but there was a change of expression, as if she were 
acknowledging his meaning instead of refusing to understand it. he would have pr

aren't up to your usual standard." she rose. "shall we have coffee in the drawing room?"

hopton stoddard added a generous sum to the award he had won from roark, and the 
stoddard temple was rebuilt for its new purpose by a group of architects chosen by ellsworth 
toohey: peter keating, gordon l. prescott, john erik snyte and somebody named gus 
webb, a boy of twenty-four who liked to utter obscenities when passing well-bred women on 
the street, and who had never handled an architectural commission of his own. three of these 
men had social and professional standing; gus webb had none; toohey included him for that 
reason. of the four gus webb had the loudest voice and the greatest self-assurance. gus 
webb said he was afraid of nothing; he meant it. they were all members of

toohey's social ideals, but if a group of people felt that some person was acquiring power 
over them, that was the time to fight such a person. the majority overruled him. ellsworth 
toohey was asked to speak at the luncheon, the attendance was enormous and toohey 
made a witty, gracious speech. many members of the a.g.a. joined the council of american 
builders, john erik snyte among the first.

the four architects in charge of the stoddard reconstruction met in keating's office, around a 
table on which they spread blueprints of the temple, photographs of roark's original 
drawings, obtained from the contractor, and a clay model which keating had ordered made. 
they talked about the depression and its disastrous effect on the building industry; they talked 
about women, and gordon l. prescott told a few jokes of a bathroom nature. then gus webb 
raised his fist and smacked it plump upon the roof of the model which was not quite dry and

s. "well, boys," he said, "let's go to work."

"gus, you son of a bitch," said keating, "the thing cost money."

"balls!" said gus, "we're not paying for it."

each of them had a set of photographs of the original sketches with the signature "howard 
roark" visible in the corner. they spent many evenings and many weeks, drawing their own 
versions right on the originals, remaking and improving. they took longer than necessary. 
they made more changes than required. they seemed to find pleasure in doing it. afterward, 
they put the four versions together and made a cooperative com

s carved into five floors, 
containing dormitories, schoolrooms, infirmary, kitchen, laundry. the entrance hall was paved 
with colored marble, the stairways had railings of hand-wrought aluminum, the shower stalls 
were glass-enclosed, the recreation rooms had gold-leafed corinthian pilasters. the huge 
windows were left untouched, merely crossed by floorlines.

the four architects had decided to achieve an effect of harmony and therefore not to use any 
historical style in its pure form. peter keating designed the white marble semi-doric portico 
that rose over the main entrance, and the venetian balconies for which new doors were cut. 
john erik snyte designed the small semi-gothic spire surmounted by a cross, and the 
bandcourses of stylized acanthus leaves which were cut into the limestone of the walls. 
gordon l. prescott designed the semi-renaissance cornice, and the glass-enclosed terrace 
projecting from the third floor. gus webb designed a cubistic ornament to frame the original

if toohey's eyes had not been fixed insolently on wynand's, he would have been ordered out 
of the office at once. but the glance told wynand that toohey knew to what extent he had 
been plagued by people recommending architects and how hard he had tried to avoid them; 
and that toohey had outwitted him by obtaining this interview for a purpose wynand had not 
expected. the impertinence of it amused wynand, as toohey had known it would.

"all right, mr. toohey. whom are you selling?"

"peter keating."

"well?"

"i beg your pardon?"

"well, sell him to me."

toohey was stopped, then shrugged brightly and plunged in:

"you understand, of course, that i'm not connected with mr. keating in any way. i'm acting only
as his friend--and yours." the voice sounded pleasantly informal, but it had lost some of its 
certainty. "honestly, i know it does sound trite, but what else can i say? it just happens to be 
the truth." wynand would not help him out. "i presumed to come here because i felt it was m

demand the best in anything you do. for a project of the size you have in mind there's not 
another architect living who can equal peter keating in efficiency, taste, originality, 
imagination. that, mr. wynand, is my sincere opinion."

"i quite believe you."

"you do?"

"of course. but, mr. toohey, why should i consider your opinion?"

"well, after all, i am your architectural expert!" he could not keep the edge of anger out of his 
voice.

"my dear, mr. toohey, don't confuse me with my readers." after a moment, toohey leaned 
back and spread his hands out in laughing helplessness.

"frankly, mr. wynand, i didn't think my word would ca

intend trying to sell you peter keating." 

"no? what did you intend?"

"only to ask that you give half an hour of your time to someone who can convince you of peter 
keating's ability much better than i can."

"who is that?"

"mrs. peter keating."

"why should i wish to discuss this matter with mrs. peter keating?"

"because she is an exceedingly beautiful woman and an extremely difficult one."

wynand threw his head back and laughed aloud.

"good god, toohey, am i as obvious as that?"

toohey, blinked, unprepared.

"really, mr. toohey, i owe you an apology, if, by allowing my tastes to become so well known, 
i caused you to be so crude. but i had no idea that among your many other humanitarian 
activities you were also a pimp."

toohey rose to his feet.

"sorry to disappoint you, mr. toohey. i have no

"i didn't think you would have, mr. wynand. not on my unsupported suggestion. i foresaw that 
several hours ago. in fact, as early as this morning. so i took the liberty of preparing for myself 
another chance to discuss this with you. i took the liberty of sending you a present. when you 
get home tonight, you will find my gift there. then, if you feel that i was justified in expecting 
you to do so, you can telephone me and i shall come over at once so that you will be able to

"toohey, this is unbelievable, but i believe you're offering me a bribe."

"i am."

"you know, that's the sort of stunt you should be allowed to get away with completely--or lose 
your job for."

"i shall rest upon your opinion of my present tonight."

"all right, mr. toohey, i'll look at your present."

toohey bowed and turned to go. he was at the door when wynand added:

"you know, toohey, one of these days you'll bore me."

"i shall endeavor not to do so until the right time," said

glad to hear it, mr. wynand."

"if you wish to enjoy that, i'll tell you also that i hate seeing this come from you. i hate your 
having been able to appreciate it. it doesn't fit you. though i was obviously wrong about you: 
you're a greater art expert than i thought you were."

"such as it is, i'll have to accept this as a compliment and thank you, mr. wynand."

"now what was it you wanted? you intended me to understand that you won't let me have this 
unless i grant an interview to mrs. peter keating?"

"why, no, mr. wynand. i've made you a present of it. i intended you only to understand that 
this is mrs. peter keating."

wynand looked at the statue, then back at toohey.

"oh you damn fool!" said wynand softly.

toohey stared at him, bewildered.

"so you really did use this as a red lamp in a window?" wynand seemed relieved; he did not 
find it necessary to hold toohey's glance now. "that's better, toohey. you're not as smart as i 
thought for a moment."

"but, mr. wynand, what...?"

"did

that sculptor has given her. and to see that same face, but without any meaning, like a dead 
caricature--don't you think one would hate the woman for that?"

"you haven't seen her."

"oh, all right, i'll see her. i told you you should be allowed to get away with your stunt 
completely or not at all. i didn't promise you to lay her, did i? only to see her."

"god knows. by the way, if it had been a lesser sculptor, you'd have lost your job over this."

"but, after all, mr. wynand, i have a contract."

"oh, save that for your labor unions, elsie! and now i think you should wish me a good night 
and get out of here."

"yes, mr. wynand. i wish you a good night."

wynand accompanied him to the hall. at the door wynand said:

"you're a poor businessman, toohey. i don't know why you're so anxious to have me meet 
mrs. keating. i don't know what your racket is in trying to get a commission for that keating of 
yours. but whatever it is, it can't be so valuable that you should have been willing to part with a 
thing like this in exchange."

"why didn't you wear your emerald bracelet?" asked peter keating. "gordon prescott's so-

ce look deserted, like a vacant apartment with the 
utilities shut off. dominique sat at the other end of the room, her thin body fitted obediently to 
the contours of a straight-backed chair; she did not look stiff, only too poised for comfort. they 
were alone, but she sat like a lady at a public function; like a lovely dress dummy in a public 
show window--a window facing a busy intersection. they had come home from a tea party at 
the house of vincent knowlton, a prominent young society man, keating's new friend. they 
had had a quiet dinner together, and now their evening was free. there were no other social 
engagements till tomorrow.

"you shouldn't have laughed at theosophy when you spoke to mrs. marsh," he said. "she 

believes in it."

"i'm sorry. i shall be more careful."

he waited to have her open a subject of conversation. she said nothing. he thought suddenly 
that she had never spoken to him first--in the twenty months of their marriage. he told himself 
that that was ridiculo

 that's bad english and bad manners. it's wrong, of course. well, let's see: vincent 
knowlton is a man whom it's pleasant to know. old families deserve a great deal of 
consideration, and we must have tolerance for the opinions of others, because tolerance is the
greatest virtue, therefore it would be unfair to force your views on vincent knowlton, and if you 
just let him believe what he pleases, he will be glad to help you too, because he's a very 
human person."

"now, that's sensible," said keating; he felt at home in recognizable language. "i think 
tolerance is very important, because..." he stopped. he finished, in an empty voice: "you said 
exactly the same thing as before."

"did you notice that," she said. she said it without question mark, indifferently, as a simple 
fact. it was not sarcasm; he wished it were; sarcasm would have granted him a personal 
recognition--the desire to hurt him. but her voice had never carried any personal relation to 
him--not for twenty months.

ife. he had added the impossible to his possessions--
dominique francon. it had been such a joy to laugh casually when friends repeated to him: 
"peter, how did you ever do it?" it had been such a pleasure to introduce her to strangers, to 
say lightly: "my wife," and to watch the stupid, uncontrolled look of envy in their eyes. once at 
a large party an elegant drunk had asked him, with a wink declaring unmistakable intentions: 
"say, do you know that gorgeous creature over there?"

"slightly," keating had answered, gratified, "she's my wife."

he often told himself gratefully that their marriage had turned out much better than he had 
expected. dominique had become an ideal wife. she devoted herself completely to his 
interests: pleasing his clients, entertaining his friends, running his home. she changed nothing 
in his existence: not his hours, not his favorite menus, not even the arrangement of his 
furniture. she had brought nothing with her, except her clothes; she had not added a singl

"i've never had much time for it. well, it does shake your insides unmercifully. but who the hell

clothes right in his reception room?"

"i suppose you will want to find some privacy?"

and he stopped. she sat looking at him, her face serene.

so?"

when he raised his head, she looked at him as if, for a moment, he was her husband. she 
said: "peter, if you could hold on to it--to what you are now--"

"i love you," he said.

they sat silently together for a long time. he felt no strain in the silence.

the telephone rang.

it was not the sound that destroyed the moment; it was the eagerness with which keating 
jumped up and ran to answer it. she heard his voice through the open door, a voice indecent 
in its relief:

"hello?...oh, hello, ellsworth!...no, not a thing....free as a lark....sure, come over, come right 
over!...okey-doke!"

"it's ellsworth," he said, returning to the living room. his voice was gay and it had a touch of 
insolence. "he wants to drop in."

she said nothing.

he busied himself emptying ash trays that contained a single match or one butt, gathering 
newspapers, adding a log

he ran to open the door when he heard the bell.

"how nice," said toohey, coming in. "a fire and just the two of you. hello, dominique. hope 
i'm not intruding."

"hello, ellsworth," she said.

"you're never intruding," said keating. "i can't tell you how glad i am to see you." he pushed a 
chair to the fire. "sit down here, ellsworth. what'll you have? you know, when i heard your 
voice on the phone...well, i wanted to jump and yelp like a pup."

"don't wag your tail, though," said toohey. "no, no drinks, thanks. how have you been, 
dominique?"

"just as i was a year ago," she said.

"but not as you were two years ago?"

"no."

"what did we do two years ago this time?" keating asked idly.

"yes, i think so....what have you been doing, peter?"

"nothing much....oh, i've just read the gallant gallstone."

"liked it?"

"yes! you know, i think it's a very important book. because it's true that there's no such thing 
as free will. we can't help what we are or what we do. it's not our fault. nobody's to blame for 
anything. it's all in your

was saying it defiantly, with a violence inappropriate to a 
literary discussion. he was not looking at toohey nor at dominique, but speaking to the room 
and to what that room had witnessed.

"substantially correct," said toohey. "to be logical, however, we should not think of 
punishment for those who are rotten. since they suffered through no fault of their own, since 
they were unlucky and underendowed, they should deserve a compensation of some sort--
more like a reward."

"why--yes!" cried keating. "that's...that's logical."

"and just," said toohey.

"got the banner pretty much where you want it, ellsworth?" asked dominique.

"what's that in reference to?"

"the gallant gallstone."

"oh. no, i can't say i have. not quite. there are always the--imponderables."

"what are you talking about?" asked keating. "professional gossip," said toohey. he 
stretched his hands to the fire and flexed his fingers playfully. "by the way, peter, are you 
doing anything about stoneridge?"

"god damn it,"

said keating. "what's the matter?"

"you know what's the matter. you know the bastard better than i do. to have a project like

wynand doing it!"

"what's the matter with mr. wynand?"

"oh come, ellsworth! you know very well if it were anyone else, i'd get that commission just 
like that"--he snapped his fingers--"i wouldn't even have to ask, the owner'd come to me. 
particularly when he knows that an architect

"i gather you do want to get stoneridge?"

"are you baiting me, ellsworth? i'd give my right arm for it."

"that wouldn't be advisable. you couldn't make any drawings then--or pretend to. it would be 

preferable to give up something less tangible."

"i'd give my soul."

"would you, peter?" asked dominique. "what's on your mind, ellsworth?" keating snapped. 
"just a practical suggestion," said toohey. "who has been your most effective salesman in 
the past and got you some of your best commissions?"

"why--dominique i guess."

"that's right. and since you can't get to wynand and it wouldn't do you any good if you did, 
don't you think dominique is the one who'll be able to persuade him?" keating stared at him. 
"are you crazy, ellsworth?" dominique leaned forward. she seemed interested.

"from what i've heard," she said, "gail wynand does

 not do favors for a woman, unless she's 
beautiful. and if she's beautiful, he doesn't do it as a favor."

toohey looked at her, underscoring the fact that he offered no denial.

"it's silly," snapped keating angrily. "how would dominique ever get to see him?"

"by telephoning his office and making an appointment," said toohey.

"who ever told you he'd grant it?"

"he did."

"when?!"

"late last night. or early this morning, to be exact."

"ellsworth!" gasped keating. he added: "i don't believe it."

"i do," said dominique, "or ellsworth wouldn't have started this conversation." she smiled at 
toohey. "so wynand promised you to see me?"

"yes, my dear."

"how did you work that?"

"oh, i offered him a convincing argument. however, it would be advisable not to delay it. you 
should telephone him tomorrow--if you wish to do it."

"why can't she telephone now?" said keating. "oh, i guess it's too late. you'll telephone first 
thing in the morning."

she looked

at him, her eyes half closed, and said nothing.

"it's a long time since you've taken any active interest in peter's career," said toohey. 
"wouldn't you like to undertake a difficult feat like that--for peter's sake?"

"if peter wants me to."

"if i want you to?" cried keating. "are you both crazy? it's the chance of a lifetime, the..." he 
saw them both looking at him curiously. he snapped: "oh, rubbish!"

"what is rubbish, peter?" asked dominique.

"are you going to be stopped by a lot of fool gossip? why, any other architect's wife'd crawl on 
her hands and knees for a chance like that to..."

"no other architect's wife would be offered the chance," said toohey. "no other architect has a
wife like dominique. you've always been so proud of that, peter."

"there's no doubt about that."

"all right, ellsworth," said dominique. "i'll telephone wynand tomorrow."

"ellsworth, you're wonderful!" said keating, not looking at her.

"i believe i'd like a drink now," said toohey. "we should celebrate."

when keating hurried out to the kitchen, toohey and dominique looked at each other. he 
smiled. he glanced at the door through which keating had gone, then nodded to her faintly, 
amused.

"you expected it," said dominique.

"of course."

"now what's the real purpose, ellsworth?"

"why, i want to help you get stoneridge for peter. it's really a terrific commission."

"why are you so anxious to have me sleep with wynand?"

"don't you think it would be an interesting experience for all concerned?"

"you're not satisfied with the way my marriage has turned out, are you, ellsworth?"

"not entirely. just about fifty percent. well, nothin

"you were very anxious to have peter marry me. you knew what the result would be, better 
than peter or i."

"peter didn't know it at all."

"well, it worked--fifty percent. you got peter keating where you wanted him--the leading 
architect of the country who's now mud clinging to your galoshes."

"i've never liked your style of expression, but it's always been accurate. i should have said: 
who's now a soul wagging its tail. your style is gentler."

"but the other fifty percent, ellsworth? a failure?"

"approximately total. my fault. i should have known better than to expect anyone like peter 
keating, even in the role of husband, to destroy you."

"well, you're frank."

"i told you on

planning to have him meet you, for a long time. if you want minor details, he did something 
that annoyed me yesterday morning. he's too observant. so i decided the time was right."

"and there was stoneridge."

"and there was stoneridge. i knew that part of it would appeal to you. you'd never sell yourself 
to save your country, your soul or the life of a man you loved. but you'll sell yourself to get a 
commission he doesn't deserve for peter keating. see what will be left of you afterward. or of 
gail wynand. i'll be interested to see it, too."

"quite correct, ellsworth."

"all of it? even the part about a man you loved--if you did?"

"yes."

"you wouldn't sell yourself for roark? though, of course, you don't like to hear that name 
pronounced."

"howard roark," she said evenly.

"you have a great deal of courage, dominique."

keating returned, carrying a tray of cocktails. his eyes were feverish and he made too many 
gestures.

gail wynand rose and met her halfway across his office.

"how do you do, mrs. keating," he said.

"how do you do, mr. wynand," said dominique.

he moved a chair for her, but when she sat down he did not cross to sit behind his desk, he 
stood studying her professionally, appraisingly. his manner implied a self-evident necessity, 
as if his reason were known to her and there could be nothing improper in this behavior.

"you look like a stylized version of your own stylized version," he said. "as a rule seeing the 
models of art works tends to make one atheistic. but this time it'

decide without standards or reason. i'm sure you don't mind my saying this. i'm really grateful 
to you for giving me a much better motive than any i could hope to find."

"i'm glad you didn't say that you've always admired the work of peter keating."

"you didn't tell me how glad you were to join the distinguished list of gail wynand's 
mistresses."

"you may enjoy my admitting it, if you wish, but i think we'll get along very well together."

"quite likely. at least, you've given me a new experience: to do what i've always done--but 
honestly. shall i now begin to give you my orders? i won't pretend they're anything else."

"if you wish."

"i saw one of his works."

"which one?"

"it doesn't matter."

toohey had expected wynand to call for him after the interview with dominique. wynand had 
not called. but a few days later, meeting toohey by chance in the city room, wynand asked 
aloud:

"mr. toohey, have so many people tried to kill you that you can't remember their names?"

toohey smiled and said: "i'm sure quite so many would like to."

"you flatter your fellow men," said wynand, walking away.

peter keating stared at the brilliant room of the restaurant. it was the most exclusive place in 
town, and the most expensive. keating gloated, chewing the thought that he was here as the 
guest of gail wynand.

he tried not to stare at the gracious elegance of wynand's figure across the table. he blessed 
wynand for having chosen to give this dinner in a public place. people were gaping at 
wynand--discreetly and with practiced camouflage, but gaping nevertheless--and their 
attention included the two gues

dominique sat between the two men. she wore a white silk dress with long sleeves and a 
cowl neck, a nun's garment that acquired the startling effect of an evening gown only by being 
so flagrantly unsuited to that purpose. she wore no jewelry. her gold hair looked like a hood. 
the dull white silk moved in angular planes with the movements of her body, revealing it in the 
manner of cold innocence, the body of a sacrificial object publicly offered, beyond the need of 
concealment or desire. keating found it unattractive. he noticed that wynand seemed to 
admire it.

someone at a distant table stared in their direction insistently, someone tall and bulky. then 
the big shape rose to its feet--and keating recognized ralston holcombe hurrying toward 
them.

"peter, my boy, so glad to see you," boomed holcombe, shaking his hand, bowing to 
dominique, conspicuously ignoring wynand. "where have you been hiding? why don't we 
see you around any more?" they had had luncheon together three days ag

wynand had risen and stood leaning forward a little, courteously. keating hesitated; then, with 
obvious reluctance, said:

"mr. wynand--mr. holcombe."

"not mr. gail wynand?" said holcombe with splendid innocence.

"mr. holcombe, if you saw one of the cough-drop smith brothers in real life, would you 
recognize him?" asked wynand.

"why--i guess so," said holcombe, blinking.

"my face, mr. holcombe, is just as much of a public bromide."

holcombe muttered a few benevolent generalities and escaped.

wynand smiled affectionately. "you didn't have to be afraid of intro

ducing mr. holcombe to 
me, mr. keating, even though he is an architect."

"afraid, mr. wynand?"

"unnecessarily, since it's all settled. hasn't mrs. keating told you that stoneridge is yours?"

"i...no, she hasn't told me...i didn't know...." wynand was smiling, but the smile remained 
fixed, and keating felt compelled to go on talking until some sign stopped him. "i hadn't quite 
hoped...not so soon...of course, i thought this dinner might be a sign...help you to decide..." 
he blurted out involuntarily: "do you always throw surprises like that--just like that?"

"whenever i can," said wynand gravely.

"i shall do my best to deserve this honor and live up to your expectations, mr. wynand."

"i have no doubt about that," said wynand.

he had said little to dominique tonight. his full attention

seemed centered on keating.

"the public has been kind to my past endeavors," said keating, "but i shall make stoneridge 
my best achievement."

"that is quite a promise, considering the distinguished list of your works."

"i had not hoped that my works were of sufficient importance to attract your attention, mr. 
wynand."

"but i know them quite well. the cosmo-slotnick building, which is pure michelangelo." 
keating's face spread in incredulous pleasure; he knew that wynand was a great authority on 
art and would not make such comparisons lightly. "the prudential bank building, whi

 the slottern department store, which is snitched christopher wren." 
keating's face had changed. "look what an illustrious company i get for the price of one. isn't 
it quite a bargain?"

keating smiled, his face tight, and said:

"i've heard about your brilliant sense of humor, mr. wynand."

"have you heard about my descriptive style?"

"what do you mean?"

wynand half turned in his chair and looked at dominique, as if he were inspecting an 
inanimate object.

"your wife has a lovely body, mr. keating. her shoulders are too thin, but admirably in scale 
with the rest of her. her legs are too long, but that gives her the elegance of line you'll find in a 
good yacht. her breasts are beautiful, don't you think?"

"architecture is a crude profession, mr. wynand," keating tried to laugh. "it doesn't prepare 
one for the superior sort of sophistication."

"you don't understand me, mr. keating?"

"if i didn't know you were a perfect gentleman, i might misunderstand it, but you can't fool 
me."

"t

hat is just what i am trying not to do."

"i appreciate compliments, mr. wynand, but i'm not conceited enough to think that we must 
talk about my wife."

"why not, mr. keating? it is considered good form to talk of the things one has--or will have--in 
common."

"mr. wynand, i...i don't understand."

"shall i be more explicit?"

"no, i..."

"no? shall we drop the subject of stoneridge?"

"oh, let's talk about stoneridge! i..."

"but we are, mr. keating."

keating looked at the room about them. he thought that things like this could not be done in 
such a place; the fastidious magnificence made it monstrous; he wished it were a dank cellar. 
he thought: blood on paving stones--all right, but not blood on a drawing-room rug....

"now i know this is a joke, mr. wynand," he said.

"it is my turn to admire your sense of humor, mr. keating."

"things like...like this aren't being done..."

"that's not what you mean at all, mr. keating. you mean, t

hey're being done all the time, but 
not talked about."

"i didn't think..."

"you thought it before you came here. you didn't mind. i grant you i'm behaving abominably. 
i'm breaking all the rules of charity. it's extremely cruel to be honest."

"please, mr. wynand, let's...drop it. i don't know what...i'm supposed to do."

"that's simple. you're supposed to slap my face." keating giggled. "you were supposed to do 
that several minutes ago."

keating noticed that his palms were wet and that he was trying to support his weight by 
holding on to the napkin on his lap. wynand and dominique were eating, slowly and 
graciously, as if they were at another table. keating thought that they were not human bodies, 
either one of them; something had vanished; the light of the crystal fixtures in the room was 
the radiance of x-rays that ate through, not the bones, but deeper; they

were souls, he 
thought, sitting at a dinner table, souls held with evening clothes, lacking the intermediate 
shape of flesh, terrifying in naked revelation--terrifying, because he expected to see torturers, 
but saw a great innocence. he wondered what they saw, what his own clothes contained if his 
physical shape had gone.

"no?" said wynand. "you don't want to do that, mr. keating? but of course you don't have to. 
just say that you don't want any of it. i won't mind. there's mr. ralston holcombe across the 
room. he can build stoneridge as well as you could."

"i don't know what you mean, mr. wynand," whispered keating. his eyes were fixed upon the 
tomato aspic on his salad plate; it was soft and shivering; it made him sick.

wynand turned to dominique.

"do you remember our conversation about a certain quest, mrs. keating? i said it was a quest 
at which you would nev

oom was warm and safe. he lurched forward and his elbow swept the plate off 
the table.

he made a kind of sound expressing regrets. somebody's shape came up, there were polite 
voices of apology, and the mess vanished from the carpet.

keating heard a voice saying: "why are you doing this?" saw two faces turned to him and 
knew that he had said it.

"mr. wynand is not doing it to torture you, peter," said dominique calmly. "he's doing it for me. 
to see how much i can take."

"that's true, mrs. keating," said wynand. "partly true. the other part is: to justify myself."

"in whose eyes?"

"yours. and my own, perhaps."

"do you need to?"

"sometimes. the banner is a contemptible paper, isn't it? well, i have paid with my honor for 
the privilege of holding a position where i can amuse myself by observing how honor operates 
in other men."

his own clothes, thought keating, contained nothing now, because the two faces did not 
notice him any longer. he was safe; his place at that table was empt

clean, steady, unfrightened eyes of man looking through a telescope and the white stare of an 
imbecile--equally, i mean quite a large, generous, magnanimous company. is it you who hate

"you're saying all the things that--since i can remember--since i began to see and think--have 
been..." she stopped.

"have been torturing you. of course. one can't love man without hating most of the creatures 
who pretend to bear his name. it's one or the other. one doesn't love god and sacrilege 
impartially. except when one doesn't know that sacrilege has been committed. because one 
doesn't know god."

"what will you say if i give you the answer people usually give me--that love is for

looks at your statue--he feels nothing. that--or a dog with a broken paw--it's all the same to 
him. he even feels that he's done something nobler by bandaging the dog's paw than by 
looking at your statue. so if you seek a glimpse of greatness, if you want exaltation, if you ask 
for god and refuse to accept the washing of wounds as substitute--you're called a hater of 
humanity, mrs. keating, because you've committed the crime of knowing a love humanity has 
not learned to deserve."

"mr. wynand, have you read what i got fired for?"

"no. i didn't then. i don't dare to now "

"why?"

he ignored the question. he said, smiling: "and so, you came to me and said 'you're the vilest 
person on earth--take me so that i'll learn self-contempt. i lack that which most people live by. 
they find life endurable, while i can't.' do you see now what you've shown?"

ion of his words, the 
finished statement, a statement of such intensity that she tried to stiffen her body, not to 
respond, and felt her body responding, forced to forget everything but the physical fact of a 
man who held her.

he let her go. she knew he had noticed. he smiled and said:

"you're tired, dominique. shall i say good night? i want to remain here for a while."

she turned obediently and walked alone down to her cabin.

5.

"what's the matter? don't i get stoneridge?" snapped peter keating.

dominique walked into the living room. he followed, waiting in the open door. the elevator boy
brought in her luggage, and left. she said, removing her gloves:

"you'll get stoneridge, peter. mr. wynand will tell you the rest himself. he wants to see you 
tonight. at eight-thirty. at his home."

"why in hell?"

"he'll tell you."

she slapped her gloves softly against her palm, a small gesture of finality, like a period at the 
end of a sentence. she turned to leave the room. he stood in her w

spoils the fun?"

"i think that's much better, peter. i'm glad." he found himself unable to preserve this attitude 
when he entered wynand's study that evening. he could not escape the awe of being 
admitted into gail wynand's home. by the time he crossed the room to the seat facing the 
desk he felt nothing but a sense of weight, and he wondered whether his feet had left prints on 
the soft carpet; like the leaded feet of a deep-sea diver. "what i have to tell you, mr. keating, 
should never have needed to be said or done," said wynand. keating had never heard a man 
speak in a manner so consciously controlled. he thought crazily that it sounded as if wynand 
held his fist closed over his voice and directed each syllable. "any extra word i speak will be 
offensive, so i shall be brief. i am going to marry your wife. she is leaving for reno tomorrow. 
here is the contract for stoneridge. i have signed it. attached is a check for two hundred and 
fifty thousand dollars

. it is in addition to what you will receive for your work under the contract. 
i'll appreciate it if you will now make no comment of any kind. i realize that i could have had 
your consent for less, but i wish no discussion. it would be intolerable if we were to bargain 

about it. therefore, will you please take this and consider the matter settled?"

he extended the contract across the desk. keating saw the pale blue rectangle of the check 
held to the top of the page by a paper clip. the clip flashed silver in the light of the desk lamp.

keating's hand did not reach to meet the paper. he said, his chin moving awkwardly to frame 
the words: "i don't want it. you can have my consent for nothing." he saw a look of 
astonishment--and almost of kindness--on wynand's face.

"you don't want it? you don't want stoneridge either?"

"i want stoneridge!" keating's hand rose and snatched the paper. 
 
 ___________________________
 
"i want it all! why should 
you get away with it? why should i care?"

wynand got up. he said, relief and regret in his voice: "right, mr. keating. for a moment, you 
had almost justified your marriage. let it remain what it was. good night."

keating did not go home. he walked to the apartment of neil dumont, his new designer and 
best friend. neil dumont was a lanky, anemic society youth, with shoulders stooped under the 
burden of too many illustrious ancestors. he was not a good designer, but he had 
connections; he was obsequious to keating in the office, and keating was obsequious to him 
after office hours.

he found dumont at home

. together, they got gordon prescott and vincent knowlton, and 
started out to make a wild night of it. keating did not drink much. he paid for everything. he 
paid more than necessary. he seemed anxious to find things to pay for. he gave exorbitant 
tips. he kept asking: "we're friends--aren't we friends?--aren't we?" he looked at the glasses 
around him and he watched the lights dancing in the liquid. he looked at the three pairs of 
eyes; they were blurred, but they turned upon him occasionally with contentment. they were 
soft and comforting.

"yes, he would."

then she asked, without transition, yet he knew that she was not speaking of wynand:

"steve, has he ever asked you about me?"

"no."

"have you told him about my coming here?"

"no."

"is that--for my sake, steve?"

"no. for his."

he knew he had told her everything she wanted to know.

she said, rising:

"let's have some tea. show me where you keep your stuff. i'll fix it."

dominique left for reno early in the morning. keating was still asleep and she did not awaken 
him to say good-bye.

when he opened his eyes, he knew that she was gone, before he looked at the clock, by the 
quality of the silence in the house. he thought he should say "good riddance," but he did not 
say it and he did not feel it. what he felt was a vast, flat sentence without subject--"it's no 
use"--related neither to himself nor to dominique. he was alone and there was no necessity to 
pretend anything. he lay in bed, on his back, his arms flu

"i'm sorry, ellsworth. but...i had to."

"make yourself at home. just ignore me for a minute, will you?"

keating sat down and waited. toohey worked, making notes on sheets of typewritten copy. he 
sharpened a pencil, the sound grating like a saw across keating's nerves. he bent over his 
copy again, rustling the pages once in a while.

half an hour later he pushed the papers aside and smiled at keating. "that's that," he said. 
keating made a small movement forward. "sit tight," said toohey, "just one telephone call i've 
got to make."

he dialed the number of gus webb. "hello, gus," he said gaily. "how are you, you walking

"now, peter, what's the matter? has the world crashed about your nose?"

keating reached into his inside pocket and produced a yellow check, crumpled, much

in a moment, toohey shrugged, sat down beside keating and slipped his arm about his 
shoulders.

"i'm sorry, peter," he said. "i apologize. i've been inexcusably rude to you. it was just the 
shock. but i understand how you feel. only you mustn't take it too seriously. it doesn't 
matter." he spoke automatically. his mind was far away. keating did not notice that. he heard 
the words. they were the spring in the desert. "it doesn't matter. you're only human. that's all 
you want to be. who's any better? who has the right to cast the first stone? w

she saw his eyes. she thought she should want to laugh; she had brought him at last to a 
shock she had never expected to achieve. but she did not laugh. he thought of henry 
cameron; of cameron saying: i have no answer to give them, howard. i'm leaving you to face 
them. you'll answer them. all of them, the wynand papers and what makes the wynand 
papers possible and what lies behind that.

"roark."

he didn't answer.

"that's worse than peter keating, isn't it?" she asked.

"much worse."

"do you want to stop me?"

"no."

he had not touched her since he had released her elbow, and that had been only a touch 
proper in an ambulance. she moved her hand and let it rest against his. he did not withdraw 
his fingers and he did not pretend indifference. she bent over, holding his hand, not raising it 
from his knee, and she pressed her lips to his hand. her hat fell off, he saw the blond head at 
his knees, he felt her mouth kissing his hand agai

"all of this useless discussion has been covered before and much better," said gus webb.

"where's it covered, gus?" asked lois cook.

"'who had been nothing shall be all,' sister."

"gus is crude, but deep," said ike. "i like him."

"go to hell," said gus.

lois cook's butler entered the room. he was a stately, elderly man and he wore full-dress 
evening clothes. he announced peter keating.

"pete?" said lois cook gaily. "why, sure, shove him in, shove him right in."

keating entered and stopped, startled, when he saw the gathering.

"oh...hello, everybody," he said bleakly. "i didn't know you had company, lois."

"that's not company. come in, pete, sit down, grab yourself a drink, you know everybody."

"hello, ellsworth," said keating, his eyes resting on toohey for support.

toohey waved his hand, scrambled to his feet and settled down in an armchair, crossing his 
legs gracefu

"as the best example of modern architecture in america, we call to your attention the new 
plant of the bassett brush company, soon to be completed. it is a small building, but in its 
modest proportions it embodies all the grim simplicity of the new discipline and presents an 
invigorating example of the grandeur of the little. it was designed by augustus webb, a 
young architect of great promise."

meeting toohey a few days later, peter keating asked, disturbed:

"say, ellsworth, did you mean it?"

"what?"

"about modern architecture."

"of course i meant it. how did you like my little piece?"

"oh, i thought it was very beautiful. very convincing. but say, ellsworth, why...why did you pick 
gus webb? after all, i've done some modernistic things in the last few years. the palmer 
building was quite bare, and the mowry building was nothing but roof and windows, and the 
sheldon warehouse was..."

at a luncheon where he had to speak on architecture, peter keating stated:

"in reviewing my career to date, i came to the conclusion that i have worked on a true 
principle: the principle that constant change is a necessity of life. since buildings are an 
indispensable part of life, it follows that architecture must change constantly. i have never 
developed any architectural prejudices for myself, but insisted on keeping my mind open to all 
the voices of the times. the fanatics who went around preaching that all structures must be 
modern were just as narr

designed in the classical tradition. they were an answer to the need of their era. neither do i 
apologize for the buildings which i designed in the modern style. they represent the coming 
better world. it is my opinion that in the humble realization of this principle lies the reward and 
the joy of being an architect."

there was gratifying publicity, and many flattering comments of envy in professional circles, 
when the news of peter keating's selection to build stoneridge was made public. he tried to 
recapture his old pleasure in such manifestations. he failed. he still felt something that 

resembled gladness, but it was faded and thin.

the effort of designing stoneridge seemed a load too vast to lift. he did not mind the 
circumstances through which he had obtained it; that, too, had become pale and weightless in 
his mind, accepted and almost forgotten. he simply could not face the task of designing the 
great number of hous

able to go back to bed.

he turned stoneridge over to neil dumont and bennett. "go ahead," he said wearily, "do what 
you want."

"what style, pete?" dumont asked. "oh, make it some sort of period--the small home owners 
won't go for it otherwise. but trim it down a little--for the press comments. give it historical 
touches and a modern feeling. any way you wish. i don't care."

dumont and bennett went ahead. keating changed a few roof lines on their sketches, a few 
windows. the preliminary drawings were approved by wynand's office. keating did not know 
whether wynand had approved in person. he did not see wynand again.

dominique had been away a month, when guy francon announced his retirement. keating 
had told him about the divorce, offering no explanation. francon had taken the news calmly. 
he had said: "i expected it. it's all right, peter. it's probably not your fault nor hers." he had not

ed it since. now he gave no explanation of his retirement, only: "i told you it was 
coming, long ago. i'm tired. good luck, peter."

the responsibility of the firm on his lonely shoulders and the prospect of his solitary name on 
the office door left keating uneasy. he needed a partner. he chose neil dumont. neil had 
grace and distinction. he was another lucius heyer. the firm became peter keating & 
cornelius dumont. some sort of drunken celebration of the event was held by a few friends, 
but keating did not attend it. he had promised to attend, but he forgot about it, went for a 
solitary weekend in the snowbound country, and did not remember the celebration until the 
morning after it was held, when he was walking alone down a frozen country road.

stoneridge was the last contract signed by the firm of francon & keating.

conceited bastard!" the indignation was too sharp and raw for a mere piece of 
professional gossip; each man took it as a personal insult; each felt himself qualified to alter, 
advise and improve the work of any man living.

"the incident illustrates to perfection," wrote ellsworth toohey, "the antisocial nature of mr. 
howard roark's egotism, the arrogance of the unbridled individualism which he has always 
personified."

among the eight chosen to design "the march of the centuries" were peter keating, gordon 
l. prescott, ralston holcombe. "i won't work with howard roark," said peter keating, when 
he saw the list of the council, "you'll have to choose. it's he or i." he was informed that mr. 
roark had declined. keating assumed leadership over the council. the press stories about 
the progress of the fair's construction referred to "peter keating and his associates."

keating had acquired a sharp, intractable manner in the last few years. he snapped orders 
and lost his patience before the

it was only when the last painter had departed that peter keating felt a sense of desolation 
and a numb weakness in the crook of his elbows. he stood in the hall, looking up at the 
ceiling. under the harsh gloss of paint he could still see the outline of the square where the 
stairway had been removed and the opening closed over. guy francon's old office was gone. 
the firm keating & dumont had a single floor left now.

he thought of the stairway and how he had walked up its red-plushed steps for the first time,

d. but the public seemed to think it, if the public thought at all. he couldn't tell. he knew 
only that tickets to "the march of the centuries" were being palmed off at screeno games in 
theaters, and that the sensation of the exposition, the financial savior, was somebody named 
juanita fay who danced with a live peacock as sole garment.

but what if the fair did flop? it had not hurt the other architects of its council. gordon l. 
prescott was going stronger than ever. it wasn't that, thought keating. it had begun before the 
fair. he could not say when.

there could be so many explanations. the depression had hit them all; others had recovered 
to some extent, keating & dumont had not. something had gone out of the firm and out of the 
circles from which it drew its clients, with the retirement of guy francon. keating realized that 
there had been art and skill and its own kind of illogical energy in the career of guy francon, 
even if the art consisted only of his social charm and the ene

society people said they liked an architect who was a liberal. the a.g.a. still existed, in stiff, 
hurt dignity, but people referred to it as the old folks' home. the council of american 
builders ruled the profession and talked about a closed shop, though no one had yet devised 
a way of achieving that. whenever an architect's name appeared in ellsworth toohey's 
column, it was always that of augustus webb. at thirty-nine, keating heard himself described 
as old-fashioned.

he had given up trying to understand. he knew dimly that the explanation of the change 
swallowing the world was of a nature he preferred not to know. in his youth he had felt an 
amicable contempt for the works of guy francon or ralston holcombe, and emulating them 
had seemed no more than innocent quackery. but he knew that gordon l. prescott and gus 
webb represented so impertinent, so vicious a fraud that to suspend the evidence of his eyes

eyond his elastic capacity. he had believed that people found greatness in holcombe 
and there had been a reasonable satisfaction in borrowing his borrowed greatness. he knew 
that no one saw anything whatever in prescott. he felt something dark and leering in the 
manner with which people spoke of prescott's genius; as if they were not doing homage to 
prescott, but spitting upon genius. for once, keating could not follow people; it was too clear, 
even to him, that public favor had ceased being a recognition of merit, that it had become 
almost a brand of shame.

he went on, driven by inertia. he could not afford his large floor of offices and he did not use 
half the rooms, but he kept them and paid the deficit out of his own pocket. he had to go on. 
he had lost a large part of his personal fortune in careless stock speculation; but he had

without joy.

he had asked his mother to come back to live with him. she had come back. they sat

french pancakes, the kind he had liked so much when he was nine years old and sick with

re important things to write about. 
toohey's criticism of "the march of the centuries" had been a blow. he told himself that his 
work had deserved it. he accepted any blame. he could afford to doubt himself. he could not 
afford to doubt ellsworth toohey.

it was neil dumont who forced him to think of toohey again. neil spoke petulantly about the 
state of the world, about crying over spilt milk, change as a law of existence, adaptability, and 
the importance of getting in on the ground floor. keating gathered, from a long, confused 
speech, that business, as they had known it, was finished, that government would take over 
whether they liked it or not, that the building trade was dying and the government would soon 
be the sole builder and they might as well get in now, if they wanted to get in at all. "look at 
gordon prescott," said neil dumont, "and what a sweet little monopoly he's got himself in 
housing projects and post offices. look at gus webb muscling in on the racket."

id not answer. neil dumont was throwing his own unconfessed thoughts at him; he 
had known that he would have to face this soon and he had tried to postpone the moment.

he did not want to think of cortlandt homes.

cortlandt homes was a government housing project to be built in astoria, on the shore of the 
east river. it was planned as a gigantic experiment in low-rent housing, to serve as model for 
the whole country; for the whole world. keating had heard architects talking about it for over a 
year. the appropriation had been approved and the site chosen; but not the architect. keating 
would not admit to himself how desperately he wanted to get cortlandt and how little chance 

he had of getting it.

"listen, pete, we might as well call a spade a spade," said neil dumont. "we're on the skids, 
pal, and you know it. all right, we'll last another year or two, coasting on your reputation. and 
then? it's not our fault. it's just that p

homes."

now he had heard it pronounced. keating wondered why the name had sounded like the 
muffled stroke of a bell; as if the sound had opened and closed a sequence which he would 
not be able to stop.

"what do you mean, neil?"

"cortlandt homes. ellsworth toohey. now you know what i mean."

"neil, i..."

"what's the matter with you, pete? listen, everybody's laughing about it. everybody's saying 
that if they were toohey's special pet, like you are, they'd get cortlandt homes like that"--he 
snapped his manicured fingers--"just like that

, and nobody can understand what you're waiting 
for. you know it's friend ellsworth who's running this particular housing show."

"it's not true. he is not. he has no official position. he never has any official position."

"whom are you kidding? most of the boys that count in every office are his boys. damned if i 
know how he got them in, but he did. what's the matter, pete? are you afraid of asking 
ellsworth toohey for a favor?"

this was it, thought keating; now there was no retreat. he could not admit to himself that he 
was afraid of asking ellsworth toohey.

"no," he said, his voice dull, "i'm not afraid, neil. i'll...all right, neil. i'll speak to ellsworth."
#

ellsworth toohey sat spread out on a couch, wearing a dressing gown. his body had the 
shape of a sloppy letter x-arms stretched over his head, along the edge of the back pillows, 
legs open in a wide fork. the dressing gown was made of silk, bearing the trademarked 
pattern of coty's

face powder, white puffs on an orange background; it looked daring and gay, 
supremely elegant through sheer silliness. under the gown, toohey wore sleeping pyjamas of 
pistachio-green linen, crumpled. the trousers floated about the thin sticks of his ankles.

this was just like toohey, thought keating; this pose amidst the severe fastidiousness of his 
living room; a single canvas by a famous artist on the wall behind him--and the rest of the 
room unobtrusive like a monk's cell; no, thought keating, like the retreat of a king in exile, 
scornful of material display.

toohey's eyes were warm, amused, encouraging. toohey had answered the telephone in 
person; toohey had granted him the appointment at once. keating thought: it's good to be 
received like this, informally. what was i afraid of? what did i doubt? we're old friends.

"oh dear me," said toohey, yawning, "one gets so tired! there comes a moment into every 
man's day when he gets the urge to relax like a stumble bum. i got home an

"that's right, ellsworth. that's just what i wanted to talk to you about. you're wonderful. you 
know me like a book."

"what kind of a book, peter? a dime novel? a love story? a crime thriller? or just a 
plagiarized manuscript? no, let's say: like a serial. a good, long, exciting serial--with the last 
installment missing. the last installment got mislaid somewhere. there won't be any last 
installment. unless, of course, it's cortlandt homes. yes, that would be a fitting closing 
chapter." keating waited, eyes intent and naked, forgetting to think of shame, of pleading that 
should be concealed. "a tremendous project, cortlandt homes. bigger than stoneridge. do 
you remember stoneridge, peter?"

he's just relaxed with me, thought keating, he's tired, he can't be tactful all the time, he 
doesn't realize what he...

gail wynand's career, peter? from wharf rat to stoneridge--do you know what a step lik

wynand has paid for every step of his way? and here i am, and i hold a project much bigger 
than stoneridge in the palm of my hand, without any effort at all." he dropped his hand and 
added: "if i do hold it. might be only a figure of speech. don't take me literally, peter."

"i hate wynand," said keating, looking down at the floor, his voice thick. "i hate him more than 
any man living."

"wynand? he's a very naive person. he's naive enough to think that men are motivated 
primarily by money."

"you aren't, ellsworth. you're a man of integrity. that's why i believe in you. it's all i've got. if i 
stopped believing in you, there would be nothing...anywhere."

"thank you. peter. that's sweet of you. hysterical, but sweet."

"ellsworth...you know how i feel about you."

"i have a fair idea."

over it. take a chance, if you care to. work me out a preliminary scheme. i can't promise 
anything. but if you come anywhere near it, i'll submit it to the right people and i'll push it for all 
i'm worth. that's all i can do for you. it's not up to me. it's really up to you."

keating sat looking at him. keating's eyes were anxious, eager and hopeless.

"care to try, peter?"

"will you let me try?"

"of course i'll let you. why shouldn't i? i'd be delighted if you, of all people, turned out to be 
the one to turn the trick."

"about the way i look, ellsworth," he said suddenly, "about the way i look...it's not because i 
mind so much that i'm a failure...it's because i can't understand why i slipped like that...from 
the top...without any reason at all..."

everything when one loses one's sense of humor."

on the following morning keating came to his office after a visit to ellsworth toohey's 
cubbyhole in the banner building. he brought with him a briefcase containing the data on the 
cortlandt homes project. he spread the papers on a large table in his office and locked the 
door. he asked a draftsman to bring him a sandwich at noon, and he ordered another 
sandwich at dinner time. "want me to help, pete?" asked neil dumont. "we could consult and 
discuss it and..." keating shook his head.

he sat at his table all night. after
 
 ___________________________
 
 a while he stopped looking at the papers; he sat still, 
thinking. he was not thinking of the charts and figures spread before him. he had studied 
them. he had understood what he could not do.

when he noticed that it was daylight, when he heard steps behind his locked door, the 
movement of men returning to work, and knew that office hours had begun, here and 
everywhere else in the city--he rose, walked to his desk and reached for the telephone book. 
he dialed the number.

"this is peter keating speaking. i should like to make an appointment to see mr. roark."

dear god, he thought while waiting, don't let him see me. make him refuse. dear god, make 
him refuse and i will have the right to hate him to the end of my days. don't let him see me.

"will four o'clock tomorrow afternoon be convenient for you, mr. keating?" said the calm, 

gentle voice of the secretary. "mr. roark will see you then."

8.

roark knew that he must not show the shock of his first glance at peter keating--and t

was too late: he saw a faint smile on keating's lips, terrible in its resigned acknowledgment of 
disintegration.

"are you only two years younger than i am, howard?" was the first thing keating asked, 
looking at the face of the man he had not seen for six years.

"i don't know, peter, i think so. i'm thirty-seven."

"i'm thirty-nine--that's all."

he moved to the chair in front of roark's desk, groping for it with his hand. he was blinded by 
the band of glass that made three walls of roark's office. he stared at the sky and the city. he 
had no feeling of height here, and the buildings seemed to lie under his toes, not a real city, 
but miniatures of famous landmarks, incongruously

 finger. he saw the 
stone and plaster of the city as a substance that had soaked up light and was throwing it back, 
row upon row of flat, vertical planes grilled with dots of windows, each plane a reflector, rose-
colored, gold and purple--and jagged streaks of smoke-blue running among them, giving them 
shape, angles and distance. light streamed from the buildings into the sky and made of the 
clear summer blue a humble second thought, a spread of pale water over living fire. my god, 
thought keating, who are the men that made all this?--and then remembered that he had been
one of them.

he saw roark's figure for an instant, straight and gaunt against the angle of two glass panes 
behind the desk, then roark sat down facing him.

keating thought of men lost in the desert and of men perishing at sea, when, in the presence 
of the silent eternity of the sky, they have to speak the truth. and now he had to speak the 
truth, because he was in the presence of the earth's greatest city.

"howard,

ions?"

keating explained, precisely, dispassionately, relating his conversation with toohey as if it 
were the summary of a court transcript he had read long ago. he pulled the papers out of his 
briefcase, put them down on the desk and went on speaking, while roark looked at them. 
roark interrupted him once. "wait a moment, peter. keep still." he waited for a long time. he 
saw roark's hand moving the papers idly, but he knew that roark was not looking at the 
papers. roark said: "go on," and keating continued obediently, allowing himself no questions.

"i suppose there's no reason why you should do it for me," he concluded. "if you can solve 
their problem, you can go to them and do it on your own."

roark smiled. "do you think i could get past toohey?"

"no. no, i don't think you could."

"who told you i was interested in housing projects?"

"what architect isn't?"

"well, i am. but not in the way you think."

he got up. it was a swift movement, impatient and tense. keating allowed himse

"you know better than that, peter. is that what you wish to tempt me with?"

"you would save my life."

"can you think of any reason why i should want to save your life?"

"no."

"well?"

"it's a great public project, howard. a humanitarian undertaking. think of the poor people who 
live in slums. if you can give them decent comfort within their means, you'll have the 
satisfaction of performing a noble deed."

"peter, you were more honest than that yesterday."

his eyes dropped, his voice low, keating said:

"you will love designing it."

"yes, peter. now you're speaking my language."

"what do you want?"

"now listen to me. i've been working on the problem of low-rent housing for years. i never 
thought of the poor people in slums. i thought of the potentialities of our modern world. the 
new materials, the means, the chances to take and use. there are so many products of man's 
genius around us today. there are such great possibilities to exploit. to build cheaply, simply, 
intelligently.

"you'll get everything society can give a man. you'll keep all the money. you'll take any fame 
or honor anyone might want to grant. you'll accept such gratitude as the tenants might feel. 
and i--i'll take what nobody can give a man, except himself. i will have built cortlandt."

"you're getting more than i am, howard."

"peter!" the voice was triumphant. "you understand that?"

"yes...."

roark leaned back against a table, and laughed softly; it was the happiest sound keating had 
ever heard.

"this will work, peter. it will work. it will be all right. you've done something wonderful. you 
haven't spoiled everything by thanking me."

keating nodded silently.

"now relax, peter. want a drink? we won't discuss any details tonight. just sit there and get 
used to me. stop being afraid of me. forget everything you said yesterday. this wipes it off. 
we're starting from the beginning. we're partners now. you have your share to do. it's a 
legitimate share. this is my ide

a of cooperation, by the way. you'll handle people. i'll do the

he walked to keating and extended his hand.

sitting still, not raising his head, keating took the hand. his fingers tightened on it for a 
moment.

when roark brought him a drink, keating swallowed three long gulps and sat looking at the 
room. his fingers were closed firmly about the glass, his arm steady; but the ice tinkled in the 
liquid once in a while, without apparent motion.

his eyes moved heavily over the room, over roark's body. he thought, it's not intentional, not 
just to hurt me, he can't help it, he doesn't even know it--but it's in his whole body, that look of 
a creature glad to be alive. and he realized he had never actually believed that any living thing

"howard...i brought something i wanted to show you."

he walked back into the room and put the briefcase on the table.

"i haven't shown it to anyone." his fingers fumbled, opening the straps. "not to mother or 
ellsworth toohey...i just want you to tell me if there's any..."

he handed to roark six of his canvases.

roark looked at them, one after another. he took a longer time than he needed. when he 
could trust himself to lift his eyes, he shook his head in silent answer to the word keating had 
not pronounced.

"it's too late, peter," he said gently.

keating nodded. "guess i...knew that."

when keating had gone, roark leaned against the door, closing his eyes. he was sick with 
pity.

he had never felt this before--not when henry cameron collapsed in the office at his feet, not 
when he saw steven mallory sobbing on a bed before him. those moments had been clean. 
but this was pity--this complete awareness of a man without worth or hope, this sense of 
finality, of the not to be

that could be folded into the walls to provide one large room or pulled out to divide it; there 
were few halls or lobbies to clean, a minimum of cost and labor required for the maintenance 
of the place. the entire plan was a composition in triangles. the buildings, of poured concrete,
were a complex modeling of simple structural features; there was no ornament; none was 
needed; the shapes had the beauty of sculpture.

ellsworth toohey did not look at the plans which keating had spread out on his desk. he 
stared at the perspective drawings. he stared, his mouth open.

then he threw his head back and howled with laughter.

"peter," he said, "you're a genius."

he added: "i think you know exactly what i mean." keating looked at him blankly, without 
curiosity. "you've succeeded in what i've spent a lifetime trying to achieve, in what centuries of 
men and bloody battles behind us have tried to achieve. i take my hat off to you, peter, in awe 
and admiration."

"look

"i haven't the slightest doubt that it will. i don't have to look. oh yes, peter, this will go through.

"you god-damn fool!" said gail wynand. "what are you up to?"

photograph captioned: "architects' drawing of cortlandt homes, the $15,000,000 federal

roark glanced at the photograph and asked: "what do you mean?"

"you know damn well what i mean. do you think i picked the things in my art gallery by their 
signatures? if peter keating designed this, i'll eat every copy of today's banner."

"peter keating designed this, gail."

"you fool. what are you after?"

"if i don't want to understand what you're talking about, i won't understand it, no matter what 
you say."

"oh, you might, if i run a story to the effect that a certain housing project was designed by 
howard roark, which would make a swell exclusive story and a joke on one mr. toohey who's 
the boy behind the boys on most of those damn projects."

it had stopped raining, but peter keating wished it would start again. the pavements 
glistened, there were dark blotches on the walls of buildings, and since it did not come from 
the sky, it looked as if the city were bathed in cold sweat. the air was heavy with untimely 
darkness, disquieting like premature old age, and there were yellow puddles of light in 
windows. keating had missed the rain, but he felt wet, from his bones out.

he had left his office early, and he walked home. the office seemed unreal to him, as it had

to the glasses, to the eyes.

"katie," he said.

she stood by the window of a bookstore; her glance hesitated halfway between recognition 
and a book title she had been examining; then, with recognition evident in the beginning of a 
smile, the glance went back to the book title, to finish and make an efficient note of it. then 
her eyes returned to keating. her smile was pleasant; not as an effort over bitterness, and not 
as welcome; just pleasant.

"why, peter keating," she said. "hello, peter."

"katie..." he could not extend his hand or move closer to her.

"yes, imagine running into you like this, why, new york is just like any small town, though i 
suppose without the better features." there was no strain in her voice.

"what are you doing here? i thought...i heard..." he knew she had a good job in washington

not so quickly. "let's find a nice, quiet place..."

"we'll go to thorpe's. there's one around the corner. they have the nicest watercress 
sandwiches."

it was she who took his arm to cross the street, and dropped it again on the other side. the 
gesture had been automatic. she had not noticed it.

there was a counter of pastry and candy inside the door of thorpe's. a large bowl of sugar-
coated almonds, green and white, glared at keating. the place smelled of orange icing. the 
lights were dim, a stuffy orange haze; the odor made the light seem sticky. the tables were 
too small, set close together.

he sat, looking down at a paper lace doily on a black glass table top. but when he lifted his 

eyes to catherine, he knew that no caution was necessary: she did not react to his scrutiny; 
her expression remained the same, whether he studied her face or that of the woman at the 
next table; she seemed to have no consciousness of

"a cup of coffee." he saw catherine's eyes on him, and in a sudden panic of embarrassment, 
feeling he must not confess that he couldn't swallow a bite of food now, feeling that the 
confession would anger her, he added: "a ham and swiss on rye, i guess."

"peter, what ghastly food habits! wait a minute, waitress. you don't want that, peter. it's very 
bad for you. you should have a fresh salad. and coffee is bad at this time of the day. 
americans drink too much coffee."

"all right," said keating.

"tea  and  a  combination   salad,  waitress ...  and--oh, waitress!--no bread with the salad--
you're gaining weight, peter--some diet crackers. please."

keating waited until the orchid uniform had moved away, and then he said, hopefully:

"i have changed, haven't i, katie? i do look pretty awful?" even a disparaging comment would 
be a personal link.

"what? oh, i guess so. it isn't healthy. but americans know nothing whatever about the 
proper nutritional balance. of course, men do make t

"i'd like to try that."

the work in the office did not require roark's presence for the next few months. his current 
jobs were being completed. two new commissions were not to be started until spring.

he had made all the sketches keating needed for cortlandt. the construction was about to 
begin. before sailing, on a day in late december, roark went to take a last look at the site of 
cortlandt. an anonymous spectator in a group of the idle curious, he stood and watched the 

steam shovels biting the earth, breaking the way for future foundations. the east river was a 
broad band of sluggish black water; and beyond, in a sparse haze of snowflakes, the towers 
of the city stood softened, half suggested in watercolors of orchid

"what have you been thinking about these past weeks?"

"the principle behind the dean who fired me from stanton."

"what principle?"

"the thing that is destroying the world. the thing you were talking about. actual selflessness."

ell you how damn glad i 
am to be back." then he sat on a table in the drafting room, while they all reported to him on 
the past three months, interrupting one another; he played with a ruler in his hands, not 
noticing it, like a man with the feel of his farm's soil under his fingers, after an absence.

in the afternoon, alone at his desk, he opened a newspaper. he had not seen a newspaper for 
three months. he noticed an item about the construction of cortlandt homes. he saw the line: 
"peter keating, architect. gordon l. prescott and augustus webb, associate designers." he 
sat very still.

that evening he went to see cortlandt. the first building was almost completed. it stood alone 
on the large, empty tract. the workers had left for the day; a small light showed in the shack of
the night watchman. the building had the skeleton of what roark had designed, with the 
remnants of ten different breeds piled on the lovely symmetry of the bones. he saw the 
economy of plan preserved, but the e

there was a band of red in the sky, to the

roark stood across the space of the future road before the first house of cortlandt. he stood 
straight, the muscles of his throat pulled, his wrists held down and away from his body, as he 
would have stood before a firing squad.

no one could tell how it had happened. there had been no deliberate intention behind it. it 
had just happened.

first, toohey told keating one morning that gordon l. prescott and gus webb would be put 
on the payroll as associate designers. "what do you care, peter? it won't come out of your 
fee. it won't cut your prestige at all, since you're the big boss. they won't be much more than 
your draftsmen. all i want is to give the boys a boost. it will help their reputation, to be tagged 
with this project in some way. i'm very interested in building up their reputation."

"but what for? there's nothing for them to do. it's all done
 
 ___________________________
 
inute drafting. save time for your own staff. you can share the expense 
with them. don't be a hog."

toohey had told the truth; he had no other purpose in mind.

keating could not discover what connections prescott and webb possessed, with whom, in 
what office, on what terms--among the dozens of officials involved in the project. the 
entanglement of responsibility was such that no one could be quite certain of anyone's 
authority. it was clear only that prescott and webb had friends, and that keating could not 
keep them off the job.

the changes began with the gymnasium. the lady in charge of tenant selection demanded a 
gymnasium. she was a social worker and her task was to end with the opening of the project. 
she acquired a permanent job by getting herself appointed director of social recreation for 
cortlandt. no gymnasium had been provided in the original plans; there were two schools and 
a y.m.c.a. within walking distance. she declared that this was an outrage against the children

prescott and webb supplied the gymnasium. other changes followed, of a purely 
esthetic nature. extras piled on the cost of construction so carefully devised for economy. the 
director of social recreation departed for washington to discuss the matter of a little theater 
and a meeting hall she wished added to the next two buildings of cortlandt.

the changes in the drawings came gradually, a few at a time. the others okaying the changes 
came from headquarters. "but we're ready to start!" cried keating. "what the hell," drawled 
gus webb, "set 'em back just a coupla thousand bucks more, that's all."

"now as to the balconies," said gordon l. prescott, "they lend a certain modern style. you 
don't want the damn thing to look so bare. it's depressing. besides, you don't understand 
psychology. the people who'll live here are used to sitting out on fire-escapes. they love it. 
they'll miss it. you gotta give 'em a place to sit on in the fresh air....the cost? hell, if you're so

prompted his protégés to their artistic endeavor, but he saw no reason for attempting to stop 
them. he was amused by the whole thing. "but it's awful, ellsworth! you know it's awful!" "oh, 
i suppose so. what do you care, peter? your poor but unwashed tenants won't be able to 
appreciate the finer points of architectural art. see that the plumbing works."

"but what for? what for? what for?" keating cried to his associate designers. "well, why 
shouldn't we have any say at all?" asked gordon l. prescott. "we want to express our 
individuality too."

when keating invoked his contract, he was told: "all right, go ahead, try to sue the 
government. try it." at times, he felt a desire to kill. there was no one to kill. had he been 
granted the privilege, he could not have chosen a victim. nobody was responsible. there was 
no purpose and no cause. it had just happened.

keating came to roark's

 house on the evening after roark's return. he had not been 
summoned. roark opened the door and said: "good evening, peter," but keating could not 
answer. they walked silently into the work room. roark sat down, but keating remained 
standing in the middle of the floor and asked his voice dull:

"what are you going to do?"

"you must leave that up to me now."

"i couldn't help it, howard....i couldn't help it!"

"i suppose not."

"what can you do now? you can't sue the government."

"no."

keating thought that he should sit down, but the distance to a chair seemed too great. he felt 
he would be too conspicuous if he moved.

"what are you going to do to me, howard?"

"nothing."

after a while keating whispered:

he waited, and then the plea he knew he must not utter came out as:

"i'm scared, howard..."

roark shook his head.

"whatever i do, it won't be to hurt you, peter. i'm guilty, too. we both are."

"you're guilty?"

"it's i who've destroyed you, peter. from the beginning. by helping you. there are matters in

the air, with rust and refuse raining out of the cloud.

roark had been indicted by a grand jury, had pleaded "not guilty" and had refused to make 
any other statement. he had been released on a bond furnished by gail wynand, and he 
awaited trial.

there were many speculations on his motive. some said it was professional jealousy. others 
declared that there was a certain similarity between the design of cortlandt and roark's style 
of building, that keating, prescott and webb might have borrowed a little from roark--"a 
legitimate adaptation"--"there's no property rights on ideas"--"in a democracy, art belongs to all 
the people"--and that roark had been prompted by the vengeance lust of an artist who had 
believed himself plagiarized.

none of it was too clear, but nobody cared too much about the motive. the issue was simple: 
one man against many. he had no right to a motive.

ellsworth toohey sat back, watched, listened and smiled.

gordon l. prescott and gus webb were entertained at dinners and cocktail parties; they were 
treated with tender, curious solicitude, like survivors of disaster. they said that they could not 
understand what possible motive roark could have had, and they demanded justice.

peter keating went nowhere. he refused to see the press. he refused to see anyone. but he 
issued a written statement that he believed roark was not guilty. his statement contained one 

curious sentence, the last. it said: "leave him alone, please can't you leave him alone?"

pickets from the council of american builders paced in front of the cord building. it served no 
purpose, because there was no work in roark's office. the commissions he was to start had 
been canceled.

"yes, i'm sure. where is he?"

the visit was unexpected. toohey had not been here for years. mrs. keating felt very grateful. 
she led the way down the hall and opened a door without knocking, afraid t

f her son's refusal. she said brightly:

"look, petey, look what a guest i have for you!"

keating lifted his head. he sat at a littered table, bent under a squat lamp that gave a poor 
light; he was doing a crossword puzzle torn out of a newspaper. there was a full glass on the 
table with a dried red rim that had been tomato juice; a box containing a jigsaw puzzle; a deck 
of cards; a bible.

"hello, ellsworth," he said, smiling. he leaned forward to rise, but forgot the effort, halfway.

mrs. keating saw the smile and stepped out hastily, relieved, closing the door.

the smile went, not quite completed. it had been an instinct of memory. then he remembered 
many things which he had tried not to understand.

"hello, ellsworth," he repeated helplessly.

toohey stood before him, examining the room, the table, with curiosity.

"touching, peter," he said. "very touching. i'm sure he'd appreciate it if he saw it."

"ellsworth, i haven't any sense of humor left. not any at all."

"that's lucky. or you'd die laughing."

"i'm so tired, ellsworth....i'm glad you came."

the light glanced off toohey's glasses and keating could not see his eyes; only two circles 
filled with a metallic smear, like the dead headlights of a car reflecting the approach of 
something from a distance.

"think you can get away with it?" asked toohey.

"with what?"

"the hermit act. the great penance. the loyal silence."

"ellsworth, what's the matter with you?"

"you make me sick. can't you take the truth? no, you want your sugar-coating. that's why i 
prefer gus webb. there's one who has no illusions."

mrs. keating threw the door open. she had heard the scream. "get out of here!" toohey 
snapped at her. she backed out, and toohey slammed the door. keating raised his head. 
"you have no right to talk to mother that way. she had nothing to do with you."

"who designed cortlandt?"

keating got up. he dragged his feet to a dresser

toohey read it and chuckled once, a dry snap of sound. then he looked at keating.

"you're a complete success, peter, as far as i'm concerned. but at times i have to want to turn 
away from the sight of my successes."

keating stood by the dresser, his shoulders slumped, his eyes empty.

"i didn't expect you to have it in writing like that, with his signature. so that's what he's done for 
you--and this is what you do in return....no, i take back the insults, peter. you had to do it.

the district attorney. roark will never know it--and it would make no difference to him if he

he folded the paper cautiously and slipped it into his pocket. keating followed his gestures, 
moving his whole head, like a kitten watching a ball on a string.

"what do you...want...ellsworth?"

"power, petey."

there were steps in the apartment above, someone skipping gaily, a few sounds on the 
ceiling as of four or five tap beats. the light fixture jingled and keating's head moved up in 
obedience. then it came back to toohey. toohey was smiling, almost indifferently.

"you...always said..." keating began thickly, and stopped.

"i've always said just that. clearly, precisely and openly. it's not my fault if you couldn't hear. 
you could, of course. you didn't want to. which was safer than deafness--for me. i said i 
intended to rule. like all my spiritual predecessors. but i'm luckier than they were. i inherited

"well, i've given you a story that will build circulation, gail."

he had heard, but he looked as if nothing of the present were relevant. he looked like a bank 
teller balancing a stranger's account that had been overdrawn and had to be closed. he said:

"i would like only to know this, if you'll tell me: that was the first time since our marriage?"

"yes."

"but it was not the first time?"

"no. he was the first man who had me."

"i think i should have understood. you married peter keating. right after the stoddard trial."

"do you wish to 'know everything? i want to tell you. i met him when he was working in a 
granite quarry. why not? you'll put him in a chain gang or a jute mill. he was working in a 
quarry. he didn't ask my consent. he raped me. that's how it began. want to use it? want to 
run it in the banner?"

"he loved you."

"yes."

"yet he built this house for us."

"yes."

"i only wanted to know."

he turned to leave.

"god damn you!" she cried. "if you can take it li

w he had found the defendant standing by the electric plunger. the night 
watchman related how he had been sent away from the scene; his testimony was brief; the 
prosecutor preferred not to stress the subject of dominique. the contractor's superintendent 
testified about the dynamite missing from the stores on the site. officials of cortlandt, building 
inspectors, estimators took the stand to describe the building and the extent of the damage. 
this concluded the first day of the trial.

peter keating was the first witness called on the following day.

he sat on the stand, slumped forward. he looked at the prosecutor obediently. his eyes 
moved, once in a while. he looked at the crowd, at the jury, at roark. it made no difference.

"mr. keating, will you state under oath whether you designed the project ascribed to you, 
known as cortlandt homes?"

"no. i didn't."

"who designed it?"

"howard roark."

"at whose request?"

"at my request."

"why did you call on him?"

"because i was not capab

s voice came evenly, well drilled. nobody in the courtroom realized 
that this testimony had been intended as a sensation. it was not a famous architect publicly 
confessing incompetence; it was a man reciting a memorized lesson. people felt mat were he 
interrupted, he would not be able to pick up the next sentence, but would have to start all over 
again from the beginning.

he answered a great many questions. the prosecutor introduced in evidence roark's original 
drawings of cortlandt, which keating had kept; the copies which keating had made of them; 
and photographs of cortlandt as it had been built.

"why did you object so strenuously to the excellent structural changes suggested by mr. 
prescott and mr. webb?"

"i was afraid of howard roark."

"what did your knowledge of his character lead you to expect?'

"anything."

"what do you mean?"

"i don't know. i was afraid. i used to be afraid."

the questions went on. the story was unusual, but the audience felt bored. it did not sound

ke the recital of a participant. the other witnesses had seemed to have a more personal 
connection with the case.

when keating left the stand, the audience had the odd impression that no change had 
occurred in the act of a man's exit; as if no person had walked out.

"the prosecution rests," said the district attorney.

the judge looked at roark.

"proceed," he said. his voice was gentle.

roark got up. "your honor, i shall call no witnesses. this will be my testimony and my 
summation."

"take the oath."

roark took the oath. he stood by the steps of the witness stand. the audience looked at him.

ast both. the form was mutilated by two second-handers who assumed 
the right to improve upon that which they had not made and could not equal. they were 
permitted to do it by the general implication that the altruistic purpose of the building 
superseded all rights and that i had no claim to stand against it.

"i agreed to design cortlandt for the purpose of seeing it erected as i designed it and for no 
other reason. that was the price i set for my work. i was not paid.

"i do not blame peter keating. he was helpless. he had a contract with his employers. it was 
ignored. he had a promise that the structure he offered would be built as designed. the 
promise was broken. the love of a man for the integrity of his work and his right to preserve it 
are now considered a vague intangible and an unessential. you have heard the prosecutor 
say that. why was the building disfigured? for no reason. such acts never have any reason, 
unless it's the vanity of some second-handers who feel they have a
