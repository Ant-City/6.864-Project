Trinculo & Stephano - 
                Trinculo,
a jester, and Stephano, a drunken butler,
are two minor members of the shipwrecked party. They provide a comic
foil to the other, more powerful pairs of Prospero and Alonso and
Antonio and Sebastian. Their drunken boasting and petty greed reflect
and deflate the quarrels and power struggles of Prospero and the
other noblemen.
