vice versa_,
and this would come close to gish-gi-mash. now, when we have a name
the pronunciation of which is not definite but approximate, and which
is written in various ways, the probabilities are that the name is
foreign. a foreign name might naturally be spelled in various ways. the
epic in the assyrian version clearly depicts dgish-gì(n)-mash as a
conqueror of erech, who forces the people into subjection, and whose
autocratic rule leads the people of erech to implore the goddess
aruru to create a rival to him who may withstand him. in response
to this appeal denkidu is formed out of dust by aruru and eventually
brought to erech. [47] gish-gì(n)-mash or gilgamesh is therefore in
all probability a foreigner; and the simplest solution suggested by the
existence of the two forms (1) gish in the old babylonian version and
(2) gish-gì(n)-mash in the assyrian version, is to regard the former
as an abbreviation, which seemed appropriate, because the short name
conveyed the

fers to a region in the west, while the same may
also be the case with gish. the resemblance of the two heroes to one
another extends to their personal appearance. when enkidu appears on
the streets of erech, the people are struck by this resemblance. they
remark that he is "like gish," though "shorter in stature" (lines
179-180). enkidu is described as a rival or counterpart. [66]

this relationship between the two is suggested also by the assyrian
version. in the creation of enkidu by aruru, the people urge the
goddess to create the "counterpart" (_zikru_) of gilgamesh, someone who
will be like him (_ma-si-il_) (tablet i, 2, 31). enkidu not only comes
from the mountain, [67] but the mountain is specifically designated as
his birth-place (i, 4, 2), precisely as in the pennsylvania tablet,
while in another passage he is also described, as in our tablet, as
"born in the field." [68] still more significant is the designation of
gilgamesh as the _talimu_, "younger brother," of e

nce of the address to enkidu in column 4 of the
pennsylvania tablet, even though certain expressions in it are
somewhat obscure. the connection of the entire episode of enkidu and
the woman with gilgamesh is very artificial; and it becomes much more
intelligible if we disassociate it from its present entanglement in
the epic. in gilgamesh's dream, portending the meeting with enkidu,
nothing is said of the woman who is the companion of the latter. the
passage in which enkidu is created by aruru to oppose gilgamesh [102]
betrays evidence of having been worked over in order to bring enkidu
into association with the longing of the people of erech to get rid
of a tyrannical character. the people in their distress appeal to
aruru to create a rival to gilgamesh. in response,


	"aruru upon hearing this created a man of anu in her heart."


now this "man of anu" cannot possibly be enkidu, for the sufficient
reason that a few lines further on enkidu is described as an offspring
of

ilgamesh, but an animal-man, as the description that follows
shows. we must separate lines 30-33 in which the creation of the "anu
man" is described from lines 34-41 in which the creation of enkidu is
narrated. indeed, these lines strike one as the proper _beginning_
of the original enkidu story, which would naturally start out with
his birth and end with his death. the description is clearly an
account of the creation of the first man, in which capacity enkidu
is brought forward.


	"aruru washed her hands, broke off clay,
	threw it on the field [103]
	... created enkidu, the hero, a lofty
	offspring of the host of ninib." [104]


the description of enkidu follows, with his body covered with hair
like an animal, and eating and drinking with the animals. there
follows an episode [105] which has no connection whatsoever with
the gilgamesh epic, but which is clearly intended to illustrate how
enkidu came to abandon the life with the animals. a hunter sees enkidu
and is am

 my hunter, take with thee a woman, etc."


and similarly the description of enkidu appears twice, lines 2-12
in an address of the hunter to his father, and lines 29-39 in the
address of the hunter to gilgamesh.

the artificiality of the process of introducing gilgamesh into
the episode is revealed by this awkward and entirely meaningless
repetition. we may therefore reconstruct the first two scenes in the
enkidu epic as follows: [106]

tablet i, col. 2, 34-35: creation of enkidu by aruru.

36-41: description of enkidu's hairy body and of his life with the
animals.

42-50: the hunter sees enkidu, who shows his anger, as also his woe,
at his condition.

3, 1-12: the hunter tells his father of the strange being who pulls
up the traps which the hunter digs, and who tears the nets so that
the hunter is unable to catch him or the animals.

19-24: the father of the hunter advises his son on his next expedition
to take a woman with him in order to lure the strange being fr

hat becomes of gilgamesh? what
is left for him?

in the first place, he is definitely the conqueror of erech. he builds
the wall of erech, [114] and we may assume that the designation of
the city as _uruk supûri_, "the walled erech," [115] rests upon this
tradition. he is also associated with the great temple eanna, "the
heavenly house," in erech. to gilgamesh belongs also the unenviable
tradition of having exercised his rule in erech so harshly that the
people are impelled to implore aruru to create a rival who may rid
the district of the cruel tyrant, who is described as snatching sons
and daughters from their families, and in other ways terrifying the
population--an early example of "schrecklichkeit." tablets ii to
v inclusive of the assyrian version being taken up with the huwawa
episode, modified with a view of bringing the two heroes together,
we come at once to the sixth tablet, which tells the story of how
the goddess ishtar wooed gilgamesh, and of the latter's reje

d by the two tablets of the old
babylonian version; just as the study of these tablets shows that
in the combination of the tales of enkidu and gilgamesh, the former
is the prototype of which gilgamesh is the copy. if the two are
regarded as brothers, as born in the same place, even resembling one
another in appearance and carrying out their adventures in common,
it is because in the process of combination gilgamesh becomes the
_reflex_ of enkidu. that enkidu is not the figure created by aruru to
relieve erech of its tyrannical ruler is also shown by the fact that
gilgamesh remains in control of erech. it is to erech that he returns
when he fails of his purpose to learn the secret of escape from old
age and death. erech is, therefore, not relieved of the presence of
the ruthless ruler through enkidu. the "man of anu" formed by aruru
as a deliverer is confused in the course of the growth of the epic
with enkidu, the offspring of ninib, and in this way we obtain the
strange con

the latter is an act of moulding out of clay.
