a grain market, but i will ask cuckoo who knows every-
thing about men and their money.'

then she clapped her hands and cuckoo ran in from
the kitchen, her high cheeks and nose flushed with the fire,
and lotus asked her:

'who was that great, large, goodly man who came to
me and then to pomegranate flower, because i was like
his little daughter, so that it troubled him, though he ever
loved me best?'

and cuckoo answered at once, 'ah, and that was liu,
the grain dealer. ah, he was a good m?n! he left silver
in my palm whenever he saw me.'

'where is his market?' asked wang lung, although idly,
because it was woman's talk and likely to come to nothing.

'in the street of the stone bridge,' said cuckoo.

then before she finished the words wang lung struck
his hands together in delight and he said:

'now then, that is where i sell my grain, and it is a
propitious thing and surely it can be done,' and for the
first time his interest was awake, b

ecause it seemed to him
a lucky thing to wed his son to the daughter of the man
who bought his grain.

w r hen there was a .thing to be done, cuckoo smelled
the money in it as a rat smells tallow, and she wiped her
hands upon her apron and she said quickly :

'i am ready to serve the master.'

wang lung was doubtful, and doubting, he looked at
her crafty face, but lotus said gaily:

'and that is true, and cuckoo shall go and ask the man
liu, and he knows her well and the thing can be done, for
cuckoo is clever enough, and if it is well done she shall
have the matchmaker's fee.'

'that will i do!' said cuckoo heartily and she laughed
as she thought of the fee of good silver on her palm, and
she untied her apron from her waist and she said busily,
'now and at once will i go, for the meat is ready except
for the moment of cooking and the vegetables are washed.'

but wang lung had not pondered the matter sufficient-
ly and it was not

but if he did this, who would believe him , who would
believe a man when he told such a thing of his own father's

brother? it was more likely that he would be beaten for
his unfilial conduct rather than his uncle suffer, and in the
end he would go in fear of his life, for if the robbers heard
of it, they wculd kill him for revenge

then, as if this were not enough, cuckoo came back
from the grain merchant with news that although the affair
of the betrothal had gone well, the merchant liu was not
willing that anything should take place now except the
exchange of the betrothal papers, for the maid was too
young for marriage, being but fourteen years old, and must
w t ait for another three years. wang lung was dismayed
at three more years of this lad's anger and idleness and
mooning eyes, for he would not go to school now two days
out of ten, and wang lung shouted at o-lan that night
when he ate :

'well, and let us betroth these other children as soon
as we are able, and the soon

 went, then, and came back saying:

'he will see you when you wish and if you can come
to drink wine this noon it is well, and if you wish it he
will come here instead.'

but wang lung did not wish the town merchant to
come to his house because he feared he would have to

prepare this and that, and so he washed himself and put
on his silk coat and he set out across the fields. he went
first to the street of bridges, as cuckoo had told him, and
there before a gate which bore the name of liu he stopped.
not that he knew the word himself, but he guessed the
gate, two doors to the right of the bridge, and he asked
one who passed and the letter was the letter of liu. it
was a respectable gate built plainly of wood, and wang
lung struck it with the palm of his hand.

immediately it opened and a woman servant stood there,
wiping her wet hands on her apron as she spoke to
ask who he was, and when he answered his name, she
stared at him, and led him into the first court where the
men live

things. but if you have need
for a servant in your great market, there is my second son,
and & sharp one he is, but if you have no need of him, let
us talk of other things.'

then the merchant said with great good humour:

'and so i have such need of a sharp young man, if he
reads and writes.'

and wang lung answered proudly:

'my sons are both good scholars and they can each
tell when a letter is wrongly written, and whether the wood
or the water radical is right.'

'that is well,' said liu. 'and let him come when he
will and his wages at first are only his food until he learns
the business, and then after a year if he do well, he may
have a piece of silver at the end of every moon, and at the
end of three years three pieces, and after that he is no
longer apprentice, but he may rise as he is able in the
business. and besides this wage, there is whatever fee he
may extract from this buyer and that seller, and this i say
nothing about if he is able to get it. and because our

 and she asked for tea to
drink, and when wang lung came she said:

'now the new year is coming and there are no cakes
and no meats ready, and i have thought of a thing. i will
not have that slave in my kitchen, but i would have you
send for my daughter-in-law, who is betrothed to our eldest
son. i have not seen her yet, but when she comes i will
tell her what to do/

wang lung was pleased' at her strength, although he
cared nothing for festivities on this year, and he sent cuckoo
in to beseech liu, the grain merchant, seeing how sad the
case was. and after a while liu was willing when he heard
that o-lan would not live the winter out, perhaps, and after
all the girl was sixteen and older than some who go to
their husband's houses.

but because of o-lan there were no feastings. the maiden
came quietly in a sedan chair, except that her mother and
an old servant came with her, and her mother went back
when she had delivered the maiden to o-lan, but the
servant remained for the maiden's use.

ot drop, so that wang lung
had to tear his daughter away. then the man laughed thickly
and he said:

'it is only play and is she not my sister? can a man
do any evil with his sister?' but his eyes glittered with
lust as he spoke and wang lung muttered and pulled the
girl away and sent her into her own room.

and wang lung told his son that night what had come
about, and the young man was grave and he said:

c we must send the maid into the town to the home of
her betrothed; even if the merchant liu says it is a year

too evil for wedding we must send her, lest we cannot
keep her virgin with this hot tiger in the house.'

so wang lung did. he went the next day into the town
and to the house of the merchant and he said :

'my daughter is thirteen years old and no longer a child
and she is fit for marriage.'

but liu was hesitant and he said:

'i have not enough profit this year to begin a family
in my house.'

now wang lung was ashamed to say. 'there is the son
of my uncle in the hou

and one answered him readily:

'eleven sons and eight daughters have your sons to-
gether.'

and he, chuckling and laughing, said back:

'add two each year, and i know the number, is it so?'

then he would sit a little while and look at the children
gathering around him to. stare. his grandsons were tall
lads now, and he looked at them, peering at them to see
what they were, and he muttered to himself:

'now that one has the look of his great-grandfather
and there is a small merchant liu, and here is myself
when young.'

and he asked them:

c do you go to school?'

'yes, grandfather,' they answered in a scattered chorus,
and he said again:
. c do you study the four books?'

then they laughed with clear young scorn at a man so
old as this and they said:

'no grandfather, and no one studies the four books
since the revolution.'

and he answered, musing:

'ah, i have heard of a revolution, but i have been too
busy in my life to attend to it. there was always the land.'

but the la
