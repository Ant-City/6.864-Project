              that you loved me still the same.
but no one tried to show her her mistake; and when she had ended her song joe was very much moved. he said that there was no time like the long ago and no music for him like poor old balfe, whatever other people might say; and his eyes filled up so much with tears that he could not find what he was looking for and in the end he had to ask his wife to tell him where the corkscrew was.




a painful case

mr james duffy lived in chapelizod because he wished to live as far as possible from the city of which he was a citizen and because he found all the other suburbs of dublin mean, modern and pretentious. he lived in an old sombre house and from his windows he could look into the disused distillery or upwards along the shallow river on which dublin is built. the lofty walls of his uncarpeted room were free from pictures. he had himself bought every article of furniture in the room: a black iron bedstead, an iro

ichael kramer, the stage directions of which were written in purple ink, and a little sheaf of papers held together by a brass pin. in these sheets a sentence was inscribed from time to time and, in an ironical moment, the headline of an advertisement for bile beans had been pasted on to the first sheet. on lifting the lid of the desk a faint fragrance escapedâ€”the fragrance of new cedarwood pencils or of a bottle of gum or of an overripe apple which might have been left there and forgotten.
mr duffy abhorred anything which betokened physical or mental disorder. a mediÃ¦val doctor would have called him saturnine. his face, which carried the entire tale of his years, was of the brown tint of dublin streets. on his long and rather large head grew dry black hair and a tawny moustache did not quite cover an unamiable mouth. his cheekbones also gave his face a harsh character; but there was no harshness in the eyes which, looking at the world from under their tawny eyebrows, gave the impression

once or twice to her husband but her tone was not such as to make the allusion a warning. her name was mrs sinico. her husbandâ€™s great-great-grandfather had come from leghorn. her husband was captain of a mercantile boat plying between dublin and holland; and they had one child.
meeting her a third time by accident he found courage to make an appointment. she came. this was the first of many meetings; they met always in the evening and chose the most quiet quarters for their walks together. mr duffy, however, had a distaste for underhand ways and, finding that they were compelled to meet stealthily, he forced her to ask him to her house. captain sinico encouraged his visits, thinking that his daughterâ€™s hand was in question. he had dismissed his wife so sincerely from his gallery of pleasures that he did not suspect that anyone else would take an interest in her. as the husband was often away and the daughter out giving music lessons mr duffy had many opportunities of enjoying the ladyâ€

ught that in her eyes he would ascend to an angelical stature; and, as he attached the fervent nature of his companion more and more closely to him, he heard the strange impersonal voice which he recognised as his own, insisting on the soulâ€™s incurable loneliness. we cannot give ourselves, it said: we are our own. the end of these discourses was that one night during which she had shown every sign of unusual excitement, mrs sinico caught up his hand passionately and pressed it to her cheek.
mr duffy was very much surprised. her interpretation of his words disillusioned him. he did not visit her for a week, then he wrote to her asking her to meet him. as he did not wish their last interview to be troubled by the influence of their ruined confessional they met in a little cakeshop near the parkgate. it was cold autumn weather but in spite of the cold they wandered up and down the roads of the park for nearly three hours. they agreed to break off their intercourse: every bond, he said, is a b

ond to sorrow. when they came out of the park they walked in silence towards the tram; but here she began to tremble so violently that, fearing another collapse on her part, he bade her good-bye quickly and left her. a few days later he received a parcel containing his books and music.
four years passed. mr duffy returned to his even way of life. his room still bore witness of the orderliness of his mind. some new pieces of music encumbered the music-stand in the lower room and on his shelves stood two volumes by nietzsche: thus spake zarathustra and the gay science. he wrote seldom in the sheaf of papers which lay in his desk. one of his sentences, written two months after his last interview with mrs sinico, read: love between man and man is impossible because there must not be sexual intercourse and f

tried to reason with her mother and had induced her to join a league. she was not at home until an hour after the accident. the jury returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence and exonerated lennon from all blame.
the deputy coroner said it was a most painful case, and expressed great sympathy with captain sinico and his daughter. he urged on the railway company to take strong measures to prevent the possibility of similar accidents in the future. no blame attached to anyone.

mr duffy raised his eyes from the paper and gazed out of his window on the cheerless evening landscape. the river lay quiet beside the empty distillery and from time to time a light appeared in some house on the lucan road. what an end! the whole narrative of her death revolted him and it revolted him to think that he had ever spoken to her of what he held sacred. the threadbare phrases, the inane expressions of sympathy, the cautious words of a reporter won over to conceal the details of a commonplace

 on the threshold; it crept into the sleeves of his coat. when he came to the public-house at chapelizod bridge he went in and ordered a hot punch.
the proprietor served him obsequiously but did not venture to talk. there were five or six workingmen in the shop discussing the value of a gentlemanâ€™s estate in county kildare. they drank at intervals from their huge pint tumblers and smoked, spitting often on the floor and sometimes dragging the sawdust over their spits with their heavy boots. mr duffy sat on his stool and gazed at them, without seeing or hearing them. after a while they went out and he called for another punch. he sat a long time over it. the shop was very quiet. the proprietor sprawled on the counter reading the herald and yawning. now and again a tram was heard swishing along the lonely road outside.
as he sat there, living over his life with her and evoking alternately the two images in which he now conceived her, he realised that she was dead, that she had ceased to exis
