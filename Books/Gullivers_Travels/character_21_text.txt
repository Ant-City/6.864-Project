strictest decency with regard to my
person; which however could not prevent some of the younger officers from
turning up their eyes as they passed under me: and, to confess the truth,
my breeches were at that time in so ill a condition, that they afforded
some opportunities for laughter and admiration.

i had sent so many memorials and petitions for my liberty, that his
majesty at length mentioned the matter, first in the cabinet, and then in
a full council; where it was opposed by none, except skyresh bolgolam,
who was pleased, without any provocation, to be my mortal enemy.  but it
was carried against him by the whole board, and confirmed by the emperor.
that minister was _galbet_, or admiral of the realm, very much in his
master‚Äôs confidence, and a person well versed in affairs, but of a morose
and sour complexion.  however, he was at length persuaded to comply; but
prevailed that the articles and conditions upon which i should be set
free, and to which i must swear, should be drawn up by himself

articles were brought to me by skyresh bolgolam in person attended by two
under-secretaries, and several persons of distinction.  after they were
read, i was demanded to swear to the performance of them; first in the
manner of my own country, and afterwards in the method prescribed by
their laws; which was, to hold my right foot in my left hand, and to
place the middle finger of my right hand on the crown of my head, and my
thumb on the tip of my right ear.  but because the reader may be curious
to have some idea of the style and manner of e

our royal person, and other marks of our favour.  given at our palace at
belfaborac, the twelfth day of the ninety-first moon of our reign.‚Äù

i swore and subscribed to these articles with great cheerfulness and
content, although some of them were not so honourable as i could have
wished; which proceeded wholly from the malice of skyresh bolgolam, the
high-admiral: whereupon my chains were immediately unlocked, and i was at
full liberty.  the emperor himself, in person, did me the honour to be by
at the whole ceremony.  i made my acknowledgements by prostrating myself
at his majesty‚Äôs feet: but he commanded me to rise; and after many
gracious expressions, which, to avoid the censure of vanity, i shall not
repeat, he added, ‚Äúthat he hoped i should prove a useful servant, and
well deserve all the favours he had already conferred upon

would hear him with patience, in a matter that highly concerned my honour
and my life.‚Äù  his speech was to the following effect, for i took notes
of it as soon as he left me:‚Äî

‚Äúyou are to know,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúthat several committees of council have been
lately called, in the most private manner, on your account; and it is but
two days since his majesty came to a full resolution.

‚Äúyou are very sensible that skyresh bolgolam‚Äù (_galbet_, or high-admiral)
‚Äúhas been your mortal enemy, almost ever since your arrival.  his
original reasons i know not; but his hatred is increased since your great
success against blefuscu, by which his glory as admiral is much obscured.
this lord, in conjunction with flimnap the high-treasurer, whose enmity
against you is notorious on account of his lady, limtoc the general,
lalcon the chamberlain, and balmuff the grand justiciary, have prepared
articles of impeachment against you, fo
