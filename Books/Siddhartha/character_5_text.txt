presents no difficulties.  everything was difficult,
toilsome, and ultimately hopeless, when i was still a samana.  now,
everything is easy, easy like that lessons in kissing, which kamala is
giving me.  i need clothes and money, nothing else; this a small, near
goals, they won't make a person lose any sleep."

he had already discovered kamala's house in the city long before, there
he turned up the following day.

"things are working out well," she called out to him.  "they are
expecting you at kamaswami's, he is the richest merchant of the city.
if he'll like you, he'll accept you into his service.  be smart, brown
samana.  i had others tell him about you.  be polite towards him, he is
very powerful.  but don't be too modest!  i do not want you to become
his servant, you shall become his equal, or else i won't be satisfied
with you.  kamaswami is starting to get old and lazy.  if he'll like
you, he'll entrust you with a lot."

siddhartha thanked her and laughed, and when she found out that he

oice, she loved the look from
his eyes.

"perhaps it is so," she said quietly, "as you say, friend.  but perhaps
it is also like this: that siddhartha is a handsome man, that his glance
pleases the women, that therefore good fortune is coming towards him."

with one kiss, siddhartha bid his farewell.  "i wish that it should be
this way, my teacher; that my glance shall please you, that always
good fortune shall come to me out of your direction!"




with the childlike people

siddhartha went to kamaswami the merchant, he was directed into a rich
house, servants led him between precious carpets into a chamber, where
he awaited the master of the house.

kamaswami entered, a swiftly, smoothly moving man with very gray hair,
with very intelligent, cautious eyes, with a greedy mouth.  politely,
the host and the guest greeted one another.

"i have been told," the merchant began, "that you were a brahman, a
learned man, but that you seek to be in the service of a merchant.
might you have become destit

fasting is the
smartest thing he could do.  when, for example, siddhartha hadn't
learned to fast, he would have to accept any kind of service before this
day is up, whether it may be with you or wherever, because hunger would
force him to do so.  but like this, siddhartha can wait calmly, he knows
no impatience, he knows no emergency, for a long time he can allow
hunger to besiege him and can laugh about it.  this, sir, is what
fasting is good for."

"you're right, samana.  wait for a moment."

kamaswami left the room and returned with a scroll, which he handed to
his guest while asking:  "can you read this?"

siddhartha looked at the scroll, on which a sales-contract had been
written down, and began to read out its contents.

"excellent," said kamaswami.  "and would you write something for me on
this piece of paper?"

he handed him a piece of paper and a pen, and siddhartha wrote and
returned the paper.

kamaswami read:  "writing is good, thinking is better.  being smart is
good, being patient

r."

"it is excellent how you're able to write," the merchant praised him.
"many a thing we will still have to discuss with one another.  for
today, i'm asking you to be my guest and to live in this house."

siddhartha thanked and accepted, and lived in the dealers house from now
on.  clothes were brought to him, and shoes, and every day, a servant
prepared a bath for him.  twice a day, a plentiful meal was served, but
siddhartha only ate once a day, and ate neither meat nor did he drink
wine.  kamaswami told him about his trade, showed him the merchandise
and storage-rooms, showed him calculations.  siddhartha got to know
many new things, he heard a lot and spoke little.  and thinking of
kamala's words, he was never subservient to the merchant, forced him
to treat him as an equal, yes even more than an equal.  kamaswami
conducted his business with care and often with passion, but siddhartha
looked upon all of this as if it was a game, the rules of which he
tried hard to learn precisely, but th

he was not in kamaswami's house for long, when he already took part in
his landlords business.  but daily, at the hour appointed by her, he
visited beautiful kamala, wearing pretty clothes, fine shoes, and soon
he brought her gifts as well.  much he learned from her red, smart
mouth.  much he learned from her tender, supple hand.  him, who was,
regarding love, still a boy and had a tendency to plunge blindly and
insatiably into lust like into a bottomless pit, him she taught,
thoroughly starting with the basics, about

he taught him,
that lovers must not part from one another after celebrating love,
without one admiring the other, without being just as defeated as they
have been victorious, so that with none of them should start feeling
fed up or bored and get that evil feeling of having abused or having
been abused.  wonderful hours he spent with the beautiful and smart
artist, became her student, her lover, her friend.  here with kamala
was the worth and purpose of his present life, nit with the business
of kamaswami.

the merchant passed to duties of writing important letters and contracts
on to him and got into the habit of discussing all important affairs
with him.  he soon saw that siddhartha knew little about rice and wool,
shipping and trade, but that he acted in a fortunate manner, and that
siddhartha surpassed him, the merchant, in calmness and equanimity, and
in the art of listening and deeply understanding previously unknown
people.  "this brahman," he said to a friend, "is no proper merchant and

he always seems to be merely playing with out business-affairs, they
never fully become a part of him, they never rule over him, he is never
afraid of failure, he is never upset by a loss."

the friend advised the merchant:  "give him from the business he
conducts for you a third of the profits, but let him also be liable for
the same amount of the losses, when there is a loss.  then, he'll become
more zealous."

kamaswami followed the advice.  but siddhartha cared little about this.
when he made a profit, he accepted it with equanimity; when he made
losses, he laughed and said:  "well, look at this, so this one turned
out badly!"

it seemed indeed, as if he did not care about the business.  at one
time, he travelled to a village to buy a large harvest of rice there.
but when he got there, the rice had already been sold to another
merchant.  nevertheless, siddhartha stayed for several days in that
village, treate

d the farmers for a drink, gave copper-coins to their
children, joined in the celebration of a wedding, and returned extremely
satisfied from his trip.  kamaswami held against him that he had not
turned back right away, that he had wasted time and money.  siddhartha
answered:  "stop scolding, dear friend!  nothing was ever achieved by
scolding.  if a loss has occurred, let me bear that loss.  i am very
satisfied with this trip.  i have gotten to know many kinds of people,
a brahman has become my friend, children have sat on my knees, farmers
have shown me their fields, nobody knew that i was a merchant."

"that's all very nice," exclaimed kamaswami indig

nantly, "but in fact,
you are a merchant after all, one ought to think!  or might you have
only travelled for your amusement?"

"surely," siddhartha laughed, "surely i have travelled for my amusement.
for what else?  i have gotten to know people and places, i have received
kindness and trust, i have found friendship.  look, my dear, if i had
been kamaswami, i would have travelled back, being annoyed and in a
hurry, as soon as i had seen that my purchase had been rendered
impossible, and time and money would indeed have been lost.  but like
this, i've had a few good days, i've learned, had joy, i've neither
harmed myself nor others by annoyance and hastiness.  and if i'll ever
return there again, perhaps to buy an upcoming harvest, or for whatever
purpose it might be, friendly people will receive me in a friendly and
happy manner, and i will prais

sure at that time.  so, leave it as it is, my friend, and don't
harm yourself by scolding!  if the day will come, when you will see:
this siddhartha is harming me, then speak a word and siddhartha will go
on his own path.  but until then, let's be satisfied with one another."

futile were also the merchant's attempts, to convince siddhartha that he
should eat his bread.  siddhartha ate his own bread, or rather they both
ate other people's bread, all people's bread.  siddhartha never listened
to kamaswami's worries and kamaswami had many worries.  whether there
was a business-deal going on which was in danger of failing, or whether
a shipment of merchandise seemed to have been lost, or a debtor seemed
to be unable to pay, kamaswami could never convince his partner that it
would be useful to utter a few words of worry or anger, to have wrinkles
on the forehead, to sleep badly.  when, one day, kamaswami held against
him that he had learned everything he knew from him, he replied:  "would

how much a basket of fish costs and how much interests may be charged on

learn from me."

indeed his soul was not with the trade.  the business was good enough
to provide him with the money for kamala, and it earned him much more
than he needed.  besides from this, siddhartha's interest and curiosity
was only concerned with the people, whose businesses, crafts, worries,
pleasures, and acts of foolishness used to be as alien and distant to
him as the moon.  however easily he succeeded in talking to all of them,
in living with all o

he was open to everything, these people brought his way.  welcome was
the merchant who offered him linen for sale, welcome was the debtor who
sought another loan, welcome was the beggar who told him for one hour
the story of his poverty and who was not half as poor as any given
samana.  he did not treat the rich foreign merchant any different than
the servant who shaved him and the street-vendor whom he let cheat him
out of some small change when buying bananas.  when kamaswami came to
him, to complain about his worries or to reproach him concerning his
business, he listened curiously and happily, was puzzled by him, tried
to understand him, consented that he was a little bit right, only as
much as he considered indispensable, and turned away from him, towards
the next person who would ask for him.  and there were many who came to
him, many to do business with him, many to cheat him, many to draw some
secret out of him, many to appeal to his sympathy, many to get his

once, he said to her:  "you are like me, you are different from most
people.  you are kamala, nothing else, and inside of you, there is a
peace and refuge, to which you can go at every hour of the day and be
at home at yourself, as i can also do.  few people have this, and yet
all could have it."

"not all people are smart," said kamala.

"no," said siddhartha, "that's not the reason why.  kamaswami is just as
smart as i, and still has no refuge in himself.  others have it, who are
small children with respect to their mind.  most people, kamala, are
like a falling leaf, which is blown and is turning around through the
air, and wavers, and tumbles to the ground.  but others, a few, are
like stars, they go on a fixed course, no wind reaches them, in
themselves they have their law and their course.  among all the learned
men and samanas, of which i knew many, there was one of this kind, a

prepared food, even fish, even meat and poultry,
spices and sweets, and to drink wine, which causes sloth and
forgetfulness.  he had learned to play with dice and on a chess-board,
to watch dancing girls, to have himself carried about in a sedan-chair,
to sleep on a soft bed.  but still he had felt different from and
superior to the others; always he had watched them with some mockery,
some mocking disdain, with the same disdain which a samana constantly
feels for the people of the world.  when kamaswami was ailing, when he
was annoyed, when he felt insulted, when he was vexed by his worries as
a merchant, siddhartha had always watched it with mockery.  just slowly
and imperceptibly, as the harvest seasons and rainy seasons passed by,
his mockery had become more tired, his superiority had become more
quiet.  just slowly, among his growing riches, siddhartha had assumed
something of the childlike people's ways for himself, something of their
childlikeness and of their fearfulness.  and yet, he e

es, with women, with their children, with honours or money,
with plans or hopes.  but he did not learn this from them, this out of
all things, this joy of a child and this foolishness of a child; he
learned from them out of all things the unpleasant ones, which he
himself despised.  it happened more and more often that, in the morning
after having had company the night before, he stayed in bed for a long
time, felt unable to think and tired.  it happened that he became angry
and impatient, when kamaswami bored him with his worries.  it happened
that he laughed just too loud, when he lost a game of dice.  his face
was still smarter and more spiritual than others, but it rarely laughed,
and assumed, one after another, those features which are so often
found in the faces of rich people, those features of discontent, of
sickliness, of ill-humour, of sloth, of a lack of love.  slowly the
disease of the soul, which rich people have, grabbed hold of him.

like a veil, like a thin mist, tiredness came

s the manner in which
his path had passed through life, for many long years, without a high
goal, without thirst, without elevation, content with small lustful
pleasures and yet never satisfied!  for all of these many years, without
knowing it himself, he had tried hard and longed to become a man like
those many, like those children, and in all this, his life had been
much more miserable and poorer than theirs, and their goals were not
his, nor their worries; after all, that entire world of the
kamaswami-people had only been a game to him, a dance he would watch, a
comedy.  only kamala had been dear, had been valuable to him--but was
she still thus?  did he still need her, or she him?  did they not play
a game without an ending?  was it necessary to live for this?  no, it
was not necessary!  the name of this game was sansara, a game for
children, a game which was perhaps enjoyable to play once, twice, ten
times--but for ever and ever over again?

then, siddhartha knew that the game was over, th

at he could not play it
any more.  shivers ran over his body, inside of him, so he felt,
something had died.

that entire day, he sat under the mango-tree, thinking of his father,
thinking of govinda, thinking of gotama.  did he have to leave them to
become a kamaswami?  he still sat there, when the night had fallen.
when, looking up, he caught sight of the stars, he thought:  "here i'm
sitting under my mango-tree, in my pleasure-garden."  he smiled a little
--was it really necessary, was it right, was it not as foolish game,
that he owned a mango-tree, that he owned a garden?

he also put an end to this, this also died in him.  he rose, bid his
farewell to the mango-tree, his farewell to the pleasure-garden.  since
he had been without food this day, he felt

strong hunger, and thought
of his house in the city, of his chamber and bed, of the table with the
meals on it.  he smiled tiredly, shook himself, and bid his farewell to
these things.

in the same hour of the night, siddhartha left his garden, left the
city, and never came back.  for a long time, kamaswami had people look
for him, thinking that he had fallen into the hands of robbers.  kamala
had no one look for him.  when she was told that siddhartha had
disappeared, she was not astonished.  did she not always expect it?  was
he not a samana, a man who was at home nowhere, a pilgrim?  and most of
all, she had felt this the last time they had been together, and she was
happy, in spite of all the pain of the loss, that she had pulled him so
affectionately to her heart for this last time, that she

thus he praised himself, found joy in himself, listened curiously to his
stomach, which was rumbling with hunger.  he had now, so he felt, in
these recent times and days, completely tasted and spit out, devoured up
to the point of desperation and death, a piece of suffering, a piece of
misery.  like this, it was good.  for much longer, he could have stayed
with kamaswami, made money, wasted money, filled his stomach, and let
his soul die of thirst; for much longer he could have lived in this
soft, well upholstered hell, if this had not happened: the moment of
complete hopelessness and despair, that most extreme moment, when he
hang over the rushing waters and was ready to destroy himself.  that he
had felt this despair, this deep disgust, and that he had not succumbed
to it, that the bird, the joyful source and voice in him was still alive

realized her situation, remembered the bite, called timidly for the boy.

"he's with you, don't worry," said siddhartha.

kamala looked into his eyes.  she spoke with a heavy tongue, paralysed
by the poison.  "you've become old, my dear," she said, "you've become
gray.  but you are like the young samana, who at one time came without
clothes, with dusty feet, to me into the garden.  you are much more like
him, than you were like him at that time when you had left me and
kamaswami.  in the eyes, you're like him, siddhartha.  alas, i have also
grown old, old--could you still recognise me?"

siddhartha smiled:  "instantly, i recognised you, kamala, my dear."

kamala pointed to her boy and said:  "did you recognise him as well?
he is your son."

her eyes became confused and fell shut.  the boy wept, siddhartha took
him on his knees, let him weep, petted his hair, and at the sight of
the child's face, a brahman prayer came to his mind, which he had
learned a long time ago, w

llow robes walking among the beautiful trees.

for a long time, he stood there, pondering, seeing images, listening to
the story of his life.  for a long time, he stood there, looked at the
monks, saw young siddhartha in their place, saw young kamala walking
among the high trees.  clearly, he saw himself being served food and
drink by kamala, receiving his first kiss from her, looking proudly and
disdainfully back on his brahmanism, beginning proudly and full of
desire his worldly life.  he saw kamaswami, saw the servants, the
orgies, the gamblers with the dice, the musicians, saw kamala's
song-bird in the cage, lived through all this once again, breathed
sansara, was once again old and tired, felt once again disgust, felt
once again the wish to annihilate himself, was once again healed by the
holy om.

after having been standing by the gate of the garden for a long time,
siddhartha realised that his desire was foolish, which had made him go
up to this place, that he could not help his son, tha
