The Child  - 
      A four-year-old girl dressed in white who also does not speak. The Step-Daughter dotes on the Child out of remorse and pity, particularly in light of what she perceives as the Mother's neglect. Her role is that of the fallen innocent, the Characters' drama demanding the elimination of the stepchildren and return to the original household.
