extremity, he said to the prior, â€œyonder is rotherwood, the dwelling of
cedric the saxon.â€

this was a joyful intimation to aymer, whose nerves were none of the
strongest, and who had suffered such agitation and alarm in the course
of passing through the dangerous bogs, that he had not yet had the
curiosity to ask his guide a single question. finding himself now at his
ease and near shelter, his curiosity began to awake, and he demanded of
the guide who and what he was.

â€œa palmer, just returned from the holy land,â€ was the answer.

â€œyou had better have tarried there to fight for the recovery of the holy
sepulchre,â€ said the templar.

â€œtrue, reverend sir knight,â€ answered the palmer, to whom the appearance
of the templar seemed perfectly familiar; â€œbut when those who are under
oath to recover the holy city, are found travelling at such a distance
from the scene of their duties, can you wonder that a peaceful peasant
like me should decline the task which they

than it derived from the usual weeds of a
pilgrim. a cloak or mantle of coarse black serge, enveloped his whole
body. it was in shape something like the cloak of a modern hussar,
having similar flaps for covering the arms, and was called a â€œsclaveynâ€,
or â€œsclavonianâ€. coarse sandals, bound with thongs, on his bare feet;
a broad and shadowy hat, with cockle-shells stitched on its brim, and
a long staff shod with iron, to the upper end of which was attached a
branch of palm, completed the palmerâ€™s attire. he followed modestly the
last of the train which entered the hall, and, observing that the lower
table scarce afforded room sufficient for the domestics of cedric and
the retinue of his guests, he withdrew to a settle placed beside and
almost under one of the large chimneys, and seemed to employ himself in
drying his garments, until the retreat of some one should make room
at the board, or the hospitality of the steward should supply him with
refreshments in the place he had chosen

once, omitted, in the joyous glee with which he heard of the glory of
his countrymen, to remark the angry confusion of his guest; â€œi would
give thee this golden bracelet, pilgrim,â€ he said, â€œcouldst thou tell me
the names of those knights who upheld so gallantly the renown of merry
england.â€

â€œthat will i do blithely,â€ replied the pilgrim, â€œand without guerdon; my
oath, for a time, prohibits me from touching gold.â€

â€œi will wear the bracelet for you, if you will, friend palmer,â€ said
wamba.

â€œthe first in honour as in arms, in renown as in place,â€ said the
pilgrim, â€œwas the brave richard, king of england.â€

â€œi forgive him,â€ said cedric; â€œi forgive him his descent from the tyrant
duke william.â€

â€œthe earl of leicester was the second,â€ continued the pilgrim; â€œsir
thomas multon of gilsland was the third.â€

â€œof saxon descent, he at least,â€ said cedric, with exultation.

â€œsir foulk doilly the fourth,â€ proceeded the pilgrim.

listened with the utmost eagerness, and forgot, in part at least, his
hatred to the normans, in the common triumph of the king of england and
his islanders. â€œand who was the fifth?â€ he demanded.

â€œthe fifth was sir edwin turneham.â€

â€œgenuine saxon, by the soul of hengist!â€ shouted cedric--â€œand the
sixth?â€ he continued with eagerness--â€œhow name you the sixth?â€

â€œthe sixth,â€ said the palmer, after a pause, in which he seemed to
recollect himself, â€œwas a young knight of lesser renown and lower rank,
assumed into that honourable company, less to aid their enterprise than
to make up their number--his name dwells not in my memory.â€

â€œsir palmer,â€ said sir brian de bois-guilbert scornfully, â€œthis assumed
forgetfulness, after so much has been remembered, comes too late to

â€œyour challenge would soon be answered,â€ replied the palmer, â€œwere your
antagonist near you. as the matter is, disturb not the peaceful hall
with vaunts of the issue of the conflict, which you well know cannot
take place. if ivanhoe ever returns from palestine, i will be his surety
that he meets you.â€

â€œa goodly security!â€ said the knight templar; â€œand what do you proffer

bosom, and crossing himself, â€œcontaining a portion of the true cross,

     --merchant of venice

as the palmer, lighted by a domestic with a torch, passed through the
intricate combination of apartments of this large and irregular mansion,
the cupbearer coming behind him whispered in his ear, that if he had
no objection to a cup of good mead in his apartment, there were many
domestics in that family who would gladly hear the news he had brought
from the holy land, and particularly that which concerned the knight of
ivanhoe. wamba presently appeared to urge the same request, observing
that a cup after mi

dnight was worth three after curfew. without
disputing a maxim urged by such grave authority, the palmer thanked them
for their courtesy, but observed that he had included in his religious
vow, an obligation never to speak in the kitchen on matters which were
prohibited in the hall. â€œthat vow,â€ said wamba to the cupbearer, â€œwould
scarce suit a serving-man.â€

the cupbearer shrugged up his shoulders in displeasure. â€œi thought to
have lodged him in the solere chamber,â€ said he; â€œbut since he is so
unsocial to christians, eâ€™en let him take the next stall to isaac the

€ said he to the torchbearer, â€œcarry the pilgrim to the
southern cell.--i give you good-night,â€ he added, â€œsir palmer, with
small thanks for short courtesy.â€

â€œgood-night, and our ladyâ€™s benison,â€ said the palmer, with composure;
and his guide moved forward.

in a small antechamber, into which several doors opened, and which was
lighted by a small iron lamp, they met a second interruption from the
waiting-maid of rowena, who, saying in a tone of authority, that her
mistress desired to speak with the palmer, took the torch from the hand
of anwold, and, bidding him await her return, made a sign to the
palmer to follow. apparently he did not think it proper to decline this
invitation as he had done the for

 torches streamed sideways into the
air, like the unfurled pennon of a chieftain. magnificence there was,
with some rude attempt at taste; but of comfort there was little, and,
being unknown, it was unmissed.

the lady rowena, with three of her attendants standing at her back, and
arranging her hair ere she lay down to rest, was seated in the sort of
throne already mentioned, and looked as if born to exact general homage.
the pilgrim acknowledged her claim to it by a low genuflection.

â€œrise, palmer,â€ said she graciously. â€œthe defender of the absent has
a right to favourable reception from all who value truth, and honour
manhood.â€ she then said to her train, â€œretire, excepting only elgitha; i
would speak with this holy pilgrim.â€

the maidens, without leaving the apartment, retired to its further
extremity, and sat down on a small bench against the wall, where they
remained mute as statues, though at such a distance that their whispers
could not have interrupted the conversation o

whose hearts must have throbbed at the sound, i, only, dare ask you
where, and in what condition, you left him of whom you spoke?--we heard,
that, having remained in palestine, on account of his impaired health,
after the departure of the english army, he had experienced the
persecution of the french faction, to whom the templars are known to be
attached.â€

â€œi know little of the knight of ivanhoe,â€ answered the palmer, with
a troubled voice. â€œi would i knew him better, since you, lady, are
interested in his fate. he hath, i believe, surmounted the persecution
of his enemies in palestine, and is on the eve of returning to england,
where you, lady, must know better than i, what is his chance of
happiness.â€

the lady rowena sighed deeply, and asked more particularly when the
knight of ivanhoe might be expected in his native country, and whether
he would not be exposed to great dangers by the road. on the fi

point, the palmer professed ignorance; on the second, he said that the
voyage might be safely made by the way of venice and genoa, and from
thence through france to england. â€œivanhoe,â€ he said, â€œwas so well
acquainted with the language and manners of the french, that there was
no fear of his incurring any hazard during that part of his travels.â€

you last saw him? had disease laid her hand heavy upon his strength and
comeliness?â€

â€œhe was darker,â€ said the palmer, â€œand thinner, than when he came from
cyprus in the train of coeur-de-lion, and care seemed to sit heavy on
his brow; but i approached not his presence, because he is unknown to
me.â€

â€œhe will,â€ said the lady, â€œi fear, find little in his native land to
clear those clouds from his countenance. thanks, good pilgrim, for your
information concerning the companion of my childhood.--maidens,â€ she
said, â€œdraw near--offer the sleeping cup to this holy man, whom i will

m repose.â€

one of the maidens presented a silver cup, containing a rich mixture of
wine and spice, which rowena barely put to her lips. it was then offered
to the palmer, who, after a low obeisance, tasted a few drops.

â€œaccept this alms, friend,â€ continued the lady, offering a piece of
gold, â€œin acknowledgment of thy painful travail, and of the shrines thou
hast visited.â€

the palmer received the boon with another low reverence, and followed
edwina out of the apartment.

in the anteroom he found his attendant anwold, who, taking the torch
from the hand of the waiting-maid, conducted him with more haste than
ceremony to an exterior and ignoble part of the building, where a number
of small apartments, or rather cells, served for sleeping places to the
lower order of domestics, and to strangers of mean degree.

â€œin which of these sleeps the jew?â€ said the pilgrim.

â€œthe

holiness.--st dunstan, how it must be scraped and cleansed ere it be
again fit for a christian!â€

â€œand where sleeps gurth the swineherd?â€ said the stranger.

â€œgurth,â€ replied the bondsman, â€œsleeps in the cell on your right, as the
jew on that to your left; you serve to keep the child of circumcision
separate from the abomination of his tribe. you might have occupied a
more honourable place had you accepted of oswaldâ€™s invitation.â€

â€œit is as well as it is,â€ said the palmer; â€œthe company, even of a jew,
can hardly spread contamination through an oaken partition.â€

so saying, he entered the cabin allotted to him, and taking the torch
from the domesticâ€™s hand, thanked him, and wished him good-night. having
shut the door of his cell, he placed the torch in a candlestick made of
wood, and looked around his sleeping apartment, the furniture of which
was of the most simple kind. it consisted of a rude wooden stool,
and still ruder hutch or bed-frame, stuffed with 
 
 ___________________________
 
clean straw, and
accommodated with two or three sheepskins by way of bed-clothes.

the palmer, having extinguished his torch, threw himself, without taking
off any part of his clothes, on this rude couch, and slept, or at least
retained his recumbent posture, till the earliest sunbeams found their
way through the little grated window, which served at once to admit both
air and light to his uncomfortable cell. he then started up, and after
repeating his matins, and adjusting his dress, he left it, and entered
that of isaac the jew, lifting the latch as gently as he could.

the inmate was
 
 ___________________________
 
 lying in troubled slumber upon a couch similar to that on
which the palmer himself had passed the night. such parts of his dress
as the jew had laid aside on the preceding evening, were disposed
carefully around his person, as if to prevent the hazard of their
being carried off during his slumbers. there was a trouble on his brow
amounting almost to agony. his hands and arms moved convulsively, as
if struggling with the nightmare; and besides several ejaculations in
hebrew, the following were distinctly heard in the norman-english, or
mixed language of the country: â€
 
 ___________________________
 
œfor the sake of the god of abraham,
spare an unhappy old man! i am poor, i am penniless--should your irons
wrench my limbs asunder, i could not gratify you!â€

the palmer awaited not the end of the jewâ€™s vision, but stirred him with
his pilgrimâ€™s staff. the touch probably associated, as is usual, with
some of the apprehensions excited by his dream; for the old man started
up, his grey hair standing almost erect upon his head, and huddling some
part of his garments about him, while he held the detached pieces with
the tenacious grasp of a falcon, he fixed upon the palmer his keen black
eyes, expressive of wild surprise and of bodily apprehension.

â€œfear not

hing from me, isaac,â€ said the palmer, â€œi come as your friend.â€

â€œthe god of israel requite you,â€ said the jew, greatly relieved; â€œi
dreamed--but father abraham be praised, it was but a dream.â€ then,
collecting himself, he added in his usual tone, â€œand what may it be your
pleasure to want at so early an hour with the poor jew?â€

â€œit is to tell you,â€ said the palmer, â€œthat if you leave not this
mansion instantly, and travel not with some haste, your journey may
prove a dangerous one.â€

â€œholy father!â€ said the jew, â€œwhom could it interest to endanger so poor
a wretch as i am?â€

â€œthe purpose you can best guess,â€ said the pilgrim; â€œbut rely on this,
that when the templar crossed the hall yesternight, he spoke to his
mussulman slaves in the saracen language, which i well understand, and
charged them this morning to watch the journey of the je

convenient distance from the mansion, and to conduct
him to the castle of philip de malvoisin, or to that of reginald
front-de-boeuf.â€

it is impossible to describe the extremity of terror which seized upon
the jew at this information, and seemed at once to overpower his whole
faculties. his arms fell down to his sides, and his head drooped on his
breast, his knees bent under his weight, every nerve and muscle of his
frame seemed to collapse and lose its energy, and he sunk at the foot of
the palmer, not in the fashion of one who intentionally stoops, kneels,
or prostrates himself to excite compassion, but like a man borne down on
all sides by the pressure of some invisible force, which crushes him to
the earth without the power of resistance.

â€œholy god of abraham!â€ was his first exclamation, folding and elevating
his wrinkled hands, but without raising his grey head from the pavement;
â€œoh, holy moses! o, blessed aaron! the dream is not dreamed for nought,
and the vision cometh not

in vain! i feel their irons already tear my
sinews! i feel the rack pass over my body like the saws, and harrows,
and axes of iron over the men of rabbah, and of the cities of the
children of ammon!â€

â€œstand up, isaac, and hearken to me,â€ said the palmer, who viewed
the extremity of his distress with a compassion in which contempt was
largely mingled; â€œyou have cause for your terror, considering how your
brethren have been used, in order to extort from them their hoards, both
by princes and nobles; but stand up, i say, and i will point out to you
the means of escape. leave this mansion instantly, while its inmates
sleep sound after the last nightâ€™s revel. i will guide you by the secret
paths of the forest, known as well to me as to any fore
 
 ___________________________
 
ster that ranges
it, and i will not leave you till you are under safe conduct of some
chief or baron going to the tournament, whose good-will you have
probably the means of securing.â€

as the ears of isaac received the hopes of escape which this speech
intimated, he began gradually, and inch by inch, as it were, to raise
himself up from the ground, until he fairly rested upon his knees,
throwing back his long grey hair and beard, and fixing his keen black
eyes upon the palmerâ€™s face, with a look expressive at once of hope and
fear, not unmingled with suspicion. but when he heard the concluding
part of the sentence, his original terror appeared to revive in full
force, and he dropt once more on his face, exclaiming, â€œâ€˜iâ€™ possess the
means of securing good-will! alas! there is but one road to the favour
of a christian, and how can the poor jew find it, whom extortions have
already reduced to the misery of lazarus?â€ then, as if suspicion had
overpowered his o
 
 ___________________________
 
ther feelings, he suddenly exclaimed, â€œfor the love of
god, young man, betray me not--for the sake of the great father who
made us all, jew as well as gentile, israelite and ishmaelite--do me no
treason! i have not means to secure the good-will of a christian beggar,
were he rating it at a single penny.â€ as he spoke these last words, he
raised himself, and grasped the palmerâ€™s mantle with a look of the
most earnest entreaty. the pilgrim extricated himself, as if there were
contamination in the touch.

â€œwert thou loaded with all the wealth of thy tribe,â€ he said, â€œwhat
interest have i to injure thee?--in this dress i am vowed to poverty,
nor do i change it for aught save a horse and a coat of mail. yet think
not that i care for thy company, or propose myself advantage by it;
remain here if thou wilt--cedric the saxon may protect thee.â€

â€œalas!â€ said th

y of his
companion; â€œbut i must secure the means of leaving this place--follow
me.â€

he led the way to the adjoining cell, which, as the reader is apprised,
was occupied by gurth the swineherd.--â€œarise, gurth,â€ said the pilgrim,
â€œarise quickly. undo the postern gate, and let out the jew and me.â€

gurth, whose occupation, though now held so mean, gave him as much
consequence in saxon england as that of eumaeus in ithaca, was offended
at the familiar and commanding tone assumed by the palmer. â€œthe jew
leaving rotherwood,â€ said he, raising himself on his elbow, and looking
superciliously at him without quitting his pallet, â€œand travelling in
company with the palmer to boot--â€

â€œi should as soon have dreamt,â€ said wamba, who entered the apartment at
the instant, â€œof his stealing away with a gammon of bacon.â€

â€œnevertheless,â€ said gurth, again laying down his head on the wooden log
which served him for a pillow, â€œboth jew and gentile must be content to
abide the

n as they stood without the postern.

â€œfetch him his mule,â€ said the pilgrim; â€œand, hearest thou,--let me have
another, that i may bear him company till he is beyond these parts--i
will return it safely to some of cedricâ€™s train at ashby. and do
thouâ€--he whispered the rest in gurthâ€™s ear.

â€œwillingly, most willingly shall it be done,â€ said gurth, and instantly
departed to execute the commission.

â€œi wish i knew,â€ said wamba, when his comradeâ€™s back was turned, â€œwhat
you palmers learn in the holy land.â€

â€œto say our orisons, fool,â€ answered the pilgrim, â€œto repent our sins,
and to mortify ourselves with fastings, vigils, and long prayers.â€

â€œsomething more potent than that,â€ answered the jester; â€œfor when would
repentance or prayer make gurth do a courtesy, or fasting or vigil
persuade him to lend you a mule?--i trow you might as well have told his
favourite black boar of thy vigils and penance, and wouldst have gotten
as civil an answer.â€

â€œgo to,

the pilgrim mounted with more deliberation, reaching, as he departed,
his hand to gurth, who kissed it with the utmost possible veneration.
the swineherd stood gazing after the travellers until they were lost
under the boughs of the forest path, when he was disturbed from his
reverie by the voice of wamba.

â€œknowest thou,â€ said the jester, â€œmy good friend gurth, that thou art
strangely courteous and most unwontedly pious on this summer morning? i
would i were a black prior or a barefoot palmer, to avail myself of thy
unwonted zeal and courtesy--certes, i would make more out of it than a
kiss of the hand.â€

â€œthou art no fool thus far, wamba,â€ answered gurth, â€œthough thou arguest
from appearances, and the wisest of us can do no more--but it is time to
look after my charge.â€

so saying, he turned back to the mansion, attended by the jester.

meanwhile the travellers continued to press on their journey with a
dispatch which argued the extremity of the jewâ€™s fears, since perso

ns at
his age are seldom fond of rapid motion. the palmer, to whom every path
and outlet in the wood appeared to be familiar, led the way through the
most devious paths, and more than once excited anew the suspicion of
the israelite, that he intended to betray him into some ambuscade of his
enemies.

his doubts might have been indeed pardoned; for, except perhaps the
flying fish, there was no race existing on the earth, in the air, or
the waters, who were the object of such an unintermitting, general, and
relentless persecution as the jews of this per

e visited; and the immense wealth they usually acquired in
commerce, while it frequently placed them in danger, was at other times
used to extend their influence, and to secure to them a certain
degree of protection. on these terms they lived; and their character,
influenced accordingly, was watchful, suspicious, and timid--yet
obstinate, uncomplying, and skilful in evading the dangers to which they
were exposed.

when the travellers had pushed on at a rapid rate through many devious
paths, the palmer at length broke silence.

â€œthat large decayed oak,â€ he said, â€œmarks the boundaries over which
front-de-boeuf claims authority--we are long since far from those of
malvoisin. there is now no fear of pursuit.â€

â€œmay the wheels of their chariots be taken off,â€ said the jew, â€œlike
those of the host of pharaoh, that they may drive heavily!--but leave me
not, good pilgrim--think but of that fierce and savage templar, with
his saracen slaves--they will regard neither territory, nor manor

, nor
lordship.â€

â€œour road,â€ said the palmer, â€œshould here separate; for it beseems not
men of my character and thine to travel together longer than needs must
be. besides, what succour couldst thou have from me, a peaceful pilgrim,
against two armed heathens?â€

â€œo good youth,â€ answered the jew, â€œthou canst defend me, and i know thou
wouldst. poor as i am, i will requite it--not with money, for money, so
help me my father abraham, i have none--but---â€

â€œmoney and recompense,â€ said the palmer, interrupting him, â€œi have

rt defend thee; since to protect a jew against a saracen,
can scarce be accounted unworthy of a christian. therefore, jew, i will
see thee safe under some fitting escort. we are now not far from the
town of sheffield, where thou mayest easily find many of thy tribe with
whom to take refuge.â€

â€œthe blessing of jacob be upon thee, good youth!â€ said the jew; â€œin
sheffield i can harbour with my kinsman zareth, and find some means of
travelling forth with safety.â€

â€œbe it so,â€ said the palmer; â€œat sheffield then we part, and
half-an-hourâ€™s riding will bring us in sight of that town.â€

the half hour was spent in perfect silence on both parts; the pilgrim
perhaps disdaining to address the jew, except in case of absolute
necessity, and the jew not presuming to force a conversation with a
person whose journey to the holy sepulchre gave a sort of sanctity to
his character. they paused on the top of a gently rising bank, and the
pilgrim, pointing to the town of sheffield, which lay

sake, spare the gyves and the dungeon to some unhappy christian who

â€œstay, stay,â€ said the jew, laying hold of his garment; â€œsomething
would i do more than this, something for thyself.--god knows the jew
is poor--yes, isaac is the beggar of his tribe--but forgive me should i
guess what thou most lackest at this moment.â€

â€œif thou wert to guess truly,â€ said the palmer, â€œit is what thou canst
not supply, wert thou as wealthy as thou sayst thou art poor.â€

â€œas i say?â€ echoed the jew; â€œo! believe it, i say but the truth; i am
a plundered, indebted, distressed man. hard hands have wrung from me my
goods, my money, my ships, and all that i possessed--yet i can tell thee
what thou lackest, and, it may be, supply it too. thy wish even now is
for a horse and armour.â€

the palmer started, and turned suddenly towards the jew:--â€œwhat fiend
prompted that g

â€œno matter,â€ said the jew, smiling, â€œso that it be a true one--and, as i
can guess thy want, so i can supply it.â€

â€œbut consider,â€ said the palmer, â€œmy character, my dress, my vow.â€

â€œi know you christians,â€ replied the jew, â€œand that the noblest of you
will take the staff and sandal in superstitious penance, and walk afoot
to visit the graves of dead men.â€

â€œblaspheme not, jew,â€ said the pilgrim, sternly.

â€œforgive me,â€ said the jew; â€œi spoke rashly. but there dropt words from
you last night and this morning, that, like sparks from flint, showed
the metal within; and in the bosom of that palmerâ€™s gown, is hidden a

ost thou know that in these
sports, the arms and steed of the knight who is unhorsed are forfeit to
his victor? now i may be unfortunate, and so lose what i cannot replace

the jew looked somewhat astounded at this possibility; but collecting
his courage, he replied hastily. â€œno--no--no--it is impossible--i will
not think so. the blessing of our father will be upon thee. thy lance
will be powerful as the rod of moses.â€

so saying, he was turning his muleâ€™s head away, when the palmer, in his
turn, took hold of his gaberdine. â€œnay, but isaac, thou knowest not all
the risk. the steed may be slain, the armour injured--for i will spare
neither horse nor man. besides, those of thy tribe give nothing for
nothing; something there must be paid for their use.â€

the jew twisted himself in the saddle, like a man in a fit of the colic;
but his better feelings predominated over those which were most familiar
to him. â€œi care not,â€ he said, â€œi care not--let me go. if there is

life and limbs.â€

â€œgramercy for thy caution,â€ said the palmer, again smiling; â€œi will use
thy courtesy frankly, and it will go hard with me but i will requite
it.â€

they parted, and took different roads for the town of sheffield.
