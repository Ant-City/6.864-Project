 i'll read you to sleep nights. they say you retain knowledge even 

when you're sleeping, if someone whispers it in your ear." 

"yes." 

"here." far away across town in the night, the faintest whisper of a turned page. "the book of 

job." 

the moon rose in the sky as montag walked, his lips moving just a trifle. 

he was eating a light supper at nine in the evening when the front door cried out in the hall and 

mildred ran from the parlour like a native fleeing an eruption of vesuvius. mrs. phelps and mrs. 

bowles came through the front door and vanished into the volcano's mouth with martinis in their 

hands: montag stopped eating. they were like a monstrous crystal chandelier tinkling in a 

thousand chimes, he saw their cheshire cat smiles burning through the walls of the house, and 

now they were screaming at each other above the din. montag found himself at the parlour door 

with his food still in his mouth. 

"doesn't everyone look nice!" 

"nice." 

"you look fine, millie! "

 fly in the air. 

"millie, did you see that?" 

"i saw it, i saw it! " 



montag reached inside the parlour wall and pulled the main switch. the images drained away, as 

if the water had been let out from a gigantic crystal bowl of hysterical fish. 

the three women turned slowly and looked with unconcealed irritation and then dislike at 

montag. 

"when do you suppose the war will start?" he said. "i notice your husbands aren't here tonight?" 

"oh, they come and go, come and go," said mrs. phelps. "in again out again finnegan, the army 

called pete yesterday. he'll be back next week. the army said so. quick war. forty-eight hours 

they said, and everyone home. that's what the army said. quick war. pete was called yesterday 

and they said he'd be, back next week. quick..." 

the three women fidgeted and looked nervously at the empty mud-coloured walls. 

"i'm not worried," said mrs. phelps. "i'll let pete do all the worrying." she giggled. "i'll let old 

pete do all the worrying. not

 me. i'm not worried. " 

"yes," said millie. "let old pete do the worrying." 

"it's always someone else's husband dies, they say." 

"i've heard that, too. i've never known any dead man killed in a war. killed jumping off 

buildings, yes, like gloria's husband last week, but from wars? no." 

"not from wars," said mrs. phelps. "anyway, pete and i always said, no tears, nothing like that. 

it's our third marriage each and we're independent. be independent, we always said. he said, if i 

get killed off, you just go right ahead and don't cry, but get married again, and don't think of me." 

"that reminds me," said mildred. "did you see that clara dove five-minute romance last night 

in your wall? well, it was all about this woman who--" 

montag said nothing but stood looking at the women's faces as he had once look

of the room were like the pale brows of 

sleeping giants now, empty of dreams. montag felt that if you touched these three staring brows 

you would feel a fine salt sweat on your finger-tips. the perspiration gathered with the silence 

and the sub-audible trembling around and about and in the women who were burning with 

tension. any moment they might hiss a long sputtering hiss and explode. 

montag moved his lips. 

"let's talk." 

the women jerked and stared. 

"how're your children, mrs. phelps?" he asked. 

"you know i haven't any! no one in his right mind, the good lord knows; would have 

children!" said mrs. phelps, not quite sure why she was angry with this man. 

"i wouldn't say that," said mrs. bowles. "i've had two children by caesarian section. no use 

going through all that agony for a baby. the world must reproduce, you know, the race must go 



on. besides, they sometimes look just like you, and that's nice. two caesarians tamed the trick, 

yes, sir. oh, my doctor said,

 caesarians aren't necessary; you've got the, hips for it, everything's 

normal, but i insisted." 

"caesarians or not, children are ruinous; you're out of your mind," said mrs. phelps. 

"i plunk the children in school nine days out of ten. i put up with them when they come home 

three days a month; it's not bad at all. you heave them into the 'parlour' and turn the switch. it's 

like washing clothes; stuff laundry in and slam the lid." mrs. bowles tittered. "they'd just as 

soon kick as kiss me. thank god, i can kick back! " 

the women showed their tongues, laughing. 

mildred sat a moment and then, seeing that montag was still in the doorway, clapped her hands. 

"let'

ear a word he said. and the 

words i did hear i didn't understand!" 

"fat, too, and didn't dress to hide it. no wonder the landslide was for winston noble. even their 

names helped. compare winston noble to hubert hoag for ten seconds and you can almost 

figure the results." 

"damn it!" cried montag. "what do you know about hoag and noble?" 

"why, they were right in that parlour wall, not six months ago. one was always picking his nose; 

it drove me wild. " 

"well, mr. montag," said mrs. phelps, "do you want us to vote for a man like that?" 

mildred beamed. "you just run away from the door, guy, and don't make us nervous." 

but montag was gone and back in a moment with a book in his hand. 

"guy!" 

"damn it all, damn it all, damn it!" 

"what've you got there; isn't that a book? i thought that all special training these days was done 

by film." mrs. phelps blinked. "you reading up on fireman theory?" 

"theory, hell," said montag. "it's poetry." 

"montag." a whisper. 

"leave me

alone! " montag felt himself turning in a great circling roar and buzz and hum. 

"montag, hold on, don't..." 

"did you hear them, did you hear these monsters talking about monsters? oh god, the way they 

jabber about people and their own children and themselves and the way they talk about their 

husbands and the way they talk about war, dammit, i stand here and i can't believe it!" 

"i didn't say a single word about any war, i'll have you know," said mrs, phelps. 

"as for poetry, i hate it," said mrs. bowles. 

"have you ever read any?" 

"montag," faber's voice scraped away at him. "you'll ruin everything. shut up, you fool!" 

"all three women were on their feet. 

"sit down!" 

they sat. 



"i'm going home," quavered mrs. bowles. 

"montag, montag, please, in the name of god, what are you up to?" pleaded faber. 

"why don't you just read us one of those poems from your little book," mrs. phelps nodded. "i 

think that'd he very interesting." 

"th

ou read out loud today. ladies, you won't understand a word. it goes umpty-tumpty- 

ump. go ahead, guy, that page, dear." 

he looked at the opened page. 

a fly stirred its wings softly in his ear. "read." 

"what's the title, dear?" 

"dover beach." his mouth was numb. 

"now read in a nice clear voice and go slow." 

the room was blazing hot, he was all fire, he was all coldness; they sat in the middle of an empty 

desert with three chairs and him standing, swaying, and him waiting for mrs. phelps to stop 

straightening her dress hem and mrs. bowles to take her fingers away from her hair. then he 

began to read in a low, stumbling voice that grew firmer as he progressed from line to line, and 

his voice went out across the desert, into the whiteness, and around the three sitting women there 

in the great hot emptiness: 

"the sea of faith 

was once, too, at the full, and round earth's shore 

lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled. 

but now i only hear 

its melancholy, long,

and naked shingles of the world.'" 

the chairs creaked under the three women. montag finished it out: 

"ah, love, let us be true 



to one another! for the world, which seems 

to lie before us like a land of dreams, 

so various, so beautiful, so new, 

hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light, 

nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain; 

and we are here as on a darkling plain 

swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight, 

where ignorant armies clash by night.'" 

mrs. phelps was crying. 

the others in the middle of the desert watched her crying grow very loud as her face squeezed 

itself out of shape. they sat, not touching her, bewildered by her display. she sobbed 

uncontrollably. montag himself was stunned and shaken. 

"sh, sh," said mildred. "you're all right, clara, now, clara, snap out of it! clara, what's wrong?" 

"i-i,", sobbed mrs. phelps, "don't know, don't know, i just don't know, oh oh..." 

mrs. bowles stood up and glared at montag. "you see? i kn

understand how it happened. i must admit that your blind raging invigorated me. god, how 
young i felt! but now-i want you to feel old, i want a little of my cowardice to be distilled in you 
tonight. the next few hours, when you see captain beatty, tiptoe round him, let me hear him for 
you, let me feel the situation out. survival is our ticket. forget the poor, silly women ...." 
"i made them unhappier than they have been in years, ithink," said montag. "it shocked me to 
see mrs. phelps cry. maybe they're right, maybe it's best not to face things, to run, have fun. i 
don't know. i feel guilty--" 

"no, you mustn't! if there were no war, if there was peace in the world, i'd say fine, have fun! 
but, montag, you mustn't go back to being just a fireman. all isn't well with the world." 
montag perspired. 
"montag, you listening?" 

"my feet," said montag. "i can't move them. i feel so damn silly. my feet won't move!" 
"listen. easy now," said the old man gently. "i know, i know.
