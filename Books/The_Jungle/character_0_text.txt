re were five pink paper roses twisted in the veil, and eleven bright
green rose leaves. there were new white cotton gloves upon her hands,
and as she stood staring about her she twisted them together feverishly.
it was almost too much for her--you could see the pain of too great
emotion in her face, and all the tremor of her form. she was so
young--not quite sixteen--and small for her age, a mere child; and she
had just been married--and married to jurgis,* (*pronounced yoorghis) of
all men, to jurgis rudkus, he with the white flower in the buttonhole of
his new black suit, he with the mighty shoulders and the giant hands.

ona was blue-eyed and fair, while jurgis had great black eyes with
beetling brows, and thick black hair that curled in waves about his
ears--in short, they were one of those incongruous and impossible
married couples with which mother nature so often wills to
confound all prophets, before and after. jurgis could take up a
two-hundred-and-fifty-pound quarter of beef and carry it

it was at the end of a week of this sort of waiting, roaming about in
the bitter winds or loafing in saloons, that jurgis stumbled on a chance
in one of the cellars of jones’s big packing plant. he saw a foreman
passing the open doorway, and hailed him for a job.

“push a truck?” inquired the man, and jurgis answered, “yes, sir!”
 before the words were well out of his mouth.

“what’s your name?” demanded the other.

“jurgis rudkus.”

“worked in the yards before?”

“yes.”

“whereabouts?”

“two places--brown’s killing beds and durham’s fertilizer mill.”

“why did you leave there?”

“the first time i had an accident, and the last time i was sent up for a
month.”

“i see. well, i’ll give you a trial. come early tomorrow and ask for mr.
thomas.”

so jurgis rushed home with the wild tidings that he had a job--that
the terrible siege was over. the remnants of the family had quite a

then, and he set to work to clean out the place, and ended in a cell in
the police station. the police station being crowded to the doors, and
stinking with “bums,” jurgis did not relish staying there to sleep off
his liquor, and sent for halloran, who called up the district leader and
had jurgis bailed out by telephone at four o’clock in the morning. when
he was arraigned that same morning, the district leader had already seen
the clerk of the court and explained that jurgis rudkus was a decent
fellow, who had been indiscreet; and so jurgis was fined ten dollars and
the fine was “suspended”--which meant that he did not have to pay for
it, and never would have to pay it, unless somebody chose to bring it up
against him in the future.

among the people jurgis lived with now money was valued according to an
entirely different standard from that of the people of packingtown; yet,
strange as it may seem, he did a great deal less drinking than he had
as a workingman. he had

tenement, and then robbed him of it. but jurgis knew none of these
things--any more than he knew that scully was but a tool and puppet of
the packers. to him scully was a mighty power, the “biggest” man he had
ever met.

he was a little, dried-up irishman, whose hands shook. he had a brief
talk with his visitor, watching him with his ratlike eyes, and making
up his mind about him; and then he gave him a note to mr. harmon, one of
the head managers of durham’s--

“the bearer, jurgis rudkus, is a particular friend of mine, and i would
like you to find him a good place, for important reasons. he was once
indiscreet, but you will perhaps be so good as to overlook that.”

mr. harmon looked up inquiringly when he read this. “what does he mean
by ‘indiscreet’?” he asked.

“i was blacklisted, sir,” said jurgis.

at which the other frowned. “blacklisted?” he said. “how do you mean?”
 and jurgis turned red with embarrassment.

he had forgotten that a blacklist did no

caught sight of the lady’s face. he knew her.

it was alena jasaityte, who had been the belle of his wedding feast!
alena jasaityte, who had looked so beautiful, and danced with such a
queenly air, with juozas raczius, the teamster! jurgis had only seen
her once or twice afterward, for juozas had thrown her over for another
girl, and alena had gone away from packingtown, no one knew where. and
now he met her here!

she was as much surprised as he was. “jurgis rudkus!” she gasped. “and
what in the world is the matter with you?”

“i--i’ve had hard luck,” he stammered. “i’m out of work, and i’ve no
home and no money. and you, alena--are you married?”

“no,” she answered, “i’m not married, but i’ve got a good place.”

they stood staring at each other for a few moments longer. finally alena
spoke again. “jurgis,” she said, “i’d help you if i could, upon my
word i would, but it happens that i’ve come out without my purse
