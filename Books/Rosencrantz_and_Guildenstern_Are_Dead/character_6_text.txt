 face as he would draw it... at last, with a little shaking of his arm, and thrice his head waving
up and down, he raises a sigh so piteous and profound that it does seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being.
that done he lets her go, and with his head over his shoulder turned, he goes backwards without taking his eyes
off her... she runs off in the opposite direction.)
 (ros and guil have frozen. guil unfreezes first. he jumps at ros.)
 guil: come on!
 (but a flourish - enter claudius and gertrude, attended.)
 claudius: welcome, dear rosencrantz... (he raises a hand at guil while
ros bows - guil bows late and hurriedly.)... and guildenstern.
 (he raises a hand at ros while guil bows to him - ros is still straightening up from his previous bow and
half way up he bows down again. with his head down, he twists to look at guil, who is on the way up.)
moreover that we did much long to see you,
 the need we have to use you did provoke
 our hasty sanding.

 so much from th'understanding of himself,
 i cannot dream of. i entreat you both
 that, being of so young days brought up with him
 and sith so neighbored to his youth and haviour
 that you ... safe your rest here on our court
 some little time, so by your companies
 to draw him on to pleasures and to gather
 so much as from occasion you may glean,
 whether ought to us unknown afflicts him thus,
 that opened lies within our remedy.
 gertrude: good (fractional suspense) gentlemen...
 (they both bow.)
 he hath much talked of you,
 and sure i am, two men there is not living
 to whom he more adheres. if it will please you
 to show us so much gentry and good will
 as to expand your time with us awhile
 for the supply and profit of our hope,
 your visitation shall receive such thanks
 as fits the king's remembrance.
 ros: both your majesties

o entreaty.
 guil: but we both obey,
 and here give up ourselves in the full bent
 to lay our service freely at your feet,
 to be commanded.
 claudius: thanks, rosencrantz (turning to ros who is caught unprepared, while guil bows) and gentle
guildenstern (turning to guil who is bent double).
 gertrude (correcting): thanks, guildenstern (turning to ros, who bows as guil checks upward movement
to bow too - both bent double, squinting at each other)... and gentle rosencrantz. (turning to guil, both
straightening up - guil checks again and bows again.)
 and i beseech you instantly to visit
 my too much changed son. go, some of you,
 and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is.

follow.)

 gertrude: ay, amen!
 (ros and guil move towards and downstage wing. before they get there,
polonius enters. they stop and bow to him. he nods and hurries upstage to
claudius. they turn to look at him but lose interest and come down to
footlights. polinius meanwhile calling to claudius.)
 polonius: the ambassadors from norway, my good lord, are joyfully
returned.
 claudius: thou still hast been the father of good news.
 polonius: have i, my lord? assure you, my good liege,
 i hold my duty as i hold my so

ion, and time is its only
measure. (he reflects, getting more desperate and rapid.) a hindu, a buddhist and a lion-tamer chanced to meet,
in a circus on the indo-chinese border. (he breaks out.) they're taking us for granted! well, i won't stand for it! in
future, notice will be taken. (he wheels again to face into the wings.) keep out, then! i forbid anyone to
enter! (no one comes - breathing heavily.) that's better....
 (immediately, behind him a grand procession enters, principally
claudius, gertrude, polonius and ophelia. claudius takes ros's elbow as he passes and is
immediately deep in conversation: the context is shakespeare
act iii, scene i. guil still faces front as claudius, ros, etc., pass
upstage and turn.)
 guil: death followed by eternity ... the worst of both worlds. it is a
terrible thought.
 (he turns upstage in time to take over the conversation with claudius.
gertrude and ros head downstage.)
 gertrude: did he receive you well?
 ros: most like a gentleman.

 ros (a flat lie and he knows it and shows it, perhaps catching guil's
eye): niggard of question, but of our demands most free in his reply.
 gertrude: did you assay him to any pastime?
 ros: madam, it so fell out that certain players
 we o'erraught on the way: of these we told him
 and there did seem in him a kind of joy
 to hear of it. they are here about the court,
 and, as i think, they have already order
 this night to play before him.
 polonius: 'tis most true
 and he beseeched me to entreat your majesties
 to hear and see the matter.
 claudius: with all my heart, and it doth content me
 to hear him so inclined.

 ros: we shall, my lord.
 claudius (leading out procession):
 sweet gertrude, leave us, too,
 for we have closely sent for hamlet hither,
 that he, as t'were by accident, may here
 affront ophelia....
 (exeunt claudius and gertrude.)
 ros (peevish): never a moment's peace! in and out, on and off, they're coming at us from all sides.
 guil: you're never satisfied.
 ros: catching us on the trot.... why can't we go by them!
 guil: what's the difference?
 ros: i'm going.

comes back quickly.)
 he's coming.

 ros: nothing.
 guil: he must be doing something.
 ros: walking.

 ros: good old east.
 guil: as soon as we make a move they'll come pouring in from every side, shouting obscure instructions,
confusing us with ridiculous remarks, messing us about from here to breakfast and getting our names wrong.
 (ros starts to protest but he has hardly opened his mouth before:)
 claudius (off-stage - with urgency): ho, guildenstern!
 (guil is still prone. small pause.)
 ros and guil: you're wanted...
 (guil furiously leaps to his feet as claudius and gertrude enter. they are in some desperation.)
 claudius: friends both, go join you with some further aid: hamlet in madness hath polonius slain, and from
his mother's closet hath he dragged him. go seek him out; speak fair and bring the body into the chapel. i pray
you haste in this. (as he and gertrude are hurrying out.) come gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends and
let them know both what we mean to do...
 (they've gone.)
 (ros and guil remain quite still.)
 guil: well....
 ros: quite....
