Konstantin Gavrilovich Treplev  - 
      One of the play's four protagonists, Treplev is Arkadina's only son. He struggles to find his voice as a writer in the shadow of his successful actress mother and her lover, the writer Trigorin, both of whom are members of the elite Russian intelligensia and artistic community. Treplev is impatient, self- defeating and childish. His need for love and approval torments him. He attempts to create new forms in dramatic writing and literature that reflect the new wave of symbolist writing that emerged in Russia during Chekhov's time. His writing parodies Chekhov's own work. Treplev is a dreamer and a compassionate soul who fills the void of affection in his life with self-doubt.
