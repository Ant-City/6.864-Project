	"who is distinguished among the heroes?

	[enkidu] is distinguished among heroes,
	[enkidu] is glorious among men." [96]


finally, the killing of lions is directly ascribed to enkidu in the
pennsylvania tablet:


	"lions he attacked
	*     *     *     *     *
	lions he overcame" [97]


whereas gilgamesh appears to be afraid of lions. on his long search
for utnapishtim he says:


	"on reaching the entrance of the mountain at night
	i saw lions and was afraid." [98]


he prays to sin and ishtar to protect and save him. when, therefore,
in another passage some one celebrates gilgamesh as the one who
overcame the "guardian," who dispatched hu(m)baba in the cedar forest,
who killed lions and overthrew the bull, [99] we have the completion
of the process which transferred to gilgamesh exploits and powers
which originally belonged to enkidu, though ordi

 [119] gilgamesh hears of
this favorite and determines to seek him out and learn from him the
secret of eternal life. the deluge story, again a pure nature myth,
symbolical of the rainy season which destroys all life in nature,
is thus attached to the epic. gilgamesh after many adventures finds
himself in the presence of the survivor of the deluge who, although
human, enjoys immortal life among the gods. he asks the survivor
how he came to escape the common fate of mankind, and in reply
utnapishtim tells the story of the catastrophe that brought about
universal destruction. the moral of the tale is obvious. only those
singled out by the special favor of the gods can hope to be removed
to the distant "source of the streams" and live forever. the rest of
mankind must face death as the end of life.

that the story of the deluge is told in the eleventh tablet of the
series, corresponding to the eleventh month, known as the month of
"rain curse" [120] and marking the height of the rain

without any reference to gilgamesh. similarly, scheil and hilprecht

in the epic the story leads to another episode attached to gilgamesh,
namely, the search for a magic plant growing in deep water, which has
the power of restoring old age to youth. utnapishtim, the survivor of
the deluge, is moved through pity for gilgamesh, worn out by his long
wanderings. at the request of his wife, utnapishtim decides to tell
gilgamesh of this plant, and he succeeds in finding it. he plucks it
and decides to take it back to erech so that all may enjoy the benefit,
but on his way stops to bathe in a cool cistern. a serpent comes along
and snatches the plant from him, and he is forced to return to erech
with his purpose unachieved. man cannot hope, when old a
