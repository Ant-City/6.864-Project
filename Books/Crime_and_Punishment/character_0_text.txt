â€œmy dear rodya,â€ wrote his motherâ€”â€œitâ€™s two months since i last had a talk with you by letter which has distressed me and even kept me awake at night, thinking. but i am sure you will not blame me for my inevitable silence. you know how i love you; you are all we have to look to, dounia and i, you are our all, our one hope, our one stay. what a grief it was to me when i heard that you had given up the university some months ago, for want of means to keep yourself and that you had lost your lessons and

your feelings, and you would not let your sister be insulted. i was in despair myself, but what could i do? and, besides, i did not know the whole truth myself then. what made it all so difficult was that dounia received a hundred roubles in advance when she took the place as governess in their family, on condition of part of her salary being deducted every month, and so it was impossible to throw up the situation without repaying the debt. this sum (now i can explain it all to you, my precious rodya) she took chiefly in order to send you sixty roubles, which you needed so terribly then and which you received from us last year. we deceived you then, writing that this money came from douniaâ€™s savings, but that was not so, and now i tell you all about it, because, thank god, things have suddenly changed for the better, and that you may know how dounia loves you and what a heart she has. at first indeed mr. svidrigaÃ¯lov treated her very rudely and used to make disrespectful and jeering rema

 this letter, which remained in mr. svidrigaÃ¯lovâ€™s hands after her departure, she had written to refuse personal explanations and secret interviews, for which he was entreating her. in that letter she reproached him with great heat and indignation for the baseness of his behaviour in regard to marfa petrovna, reminding him that he was the father and head of a family and telling him how infamous it was of him to torment and make unhappy a defenceless girl, unhappy enough already. indeed, dear rodya, the letter was so nobly and touchingly written that i sobbed when i read it and to this day i cannot read it without tears. moreover, the evidence of the servants, too, cleared douniaâ€™s reputation; they had seen and known a great deal more than mr. svidrigaÃ¯lov had himself supposedâ€”as indeed is always the case with servants. marfa petrovna was completely taken aback, and â€˜again crushedâ€™ as she said herself to us, but she was completely convinced of douniaâ€™s innocence. the very next

reputation and the whole ignominy of this affair rested as an indelible disgrace upon her husband, as the only person to blame, so that i really began to feel sorry for him; it was really treating the crazy fellow too harshly. dounia was at once asked to give lessons in several families, but she refused. all of a sudden everyone began to treat her with marked respect and all this did much to bring about the event by which, one may say, our whole fortunes are now transformed. you must know, dear rodya, that dounia has a suitor and that she has already consented to marry him. i hasten to tell you all about the matter, and though it has been arranged without asking your consent, i think you will not be aggrieved with me or with your sister on that account, for you will see that we could not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you. and you could not have judged all the facts without being on the spot. this was how it happened. he is already of the rank of a counsellor, pyotr petrov

 at last she knelt down before the ikon and prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told me that she had decided.
â€œi have mentioned already that pyotr petrovitch is just setting off for petersburg, where he has a great deal of business, and he wants to open a legal bureau. he has been occupied for many years in conducting civil and commercial litigation, and only the other day he won an important case. he has to be in petersburg because he has an important case before the senate. so, rodya dear, he may be of the greatest use to you, in every way indeed, and dounia and i have agreed that from this very day you could definitely enter upon your career and might consider that your future is marked out and assured for you. oh, if only this comes to pass! this would be such a benefit that we could only look upon it as a providential blessing. dounia is dreaming of nothing else. we have even ventured already to drop a few words on the subject to pyotr petrovitch. he was cautious in his

as no need to speak of it aloud, and better not to speak of it. most likely it was partly like that, from motherâ€™s letter itâ€™s evident: he struck her as rude a little, and mother in her simplicity took her observations to dounia. and she was sure to be vexed and â€˜answered her angrily.â€™ i should think so! who would not be angered when it was quite clear without any naÃ¯ve questions and when it was understood that it was useless to discuss it. and why does she write to me, â€˜love dounia, rodya, and she loves you more than herselfâ€™? has she a secret conscience-prick at sacrificing her daughter to her son? â€˜you are our one comfort, you are everything to us.â€™ oh, mother!â€
his bitterness grew more and more intense, and if he had happened to meet mr. luzhin at the moment, he might have murdered him.

â€œstop, iâ€™ll do it alone,â€ said the latter, taking the pen and signing his name.
the messenger took out the money and went away.
â€œbravo! and now, brother, are you hungry?â€
â€œyes,â€ answered raskolnikov.
â€œis there any soup?â€

â€œyes.â€
â€œi know it by heart.

ut after giving him a few more spoonfuls of soup, razumihin suddenly stopped, and said that he must ask zossimov whether he ought to have more.
nastasya came in with two bottles of beer.
â€œand will you have tea?â€
â€œyes.â€
â€œcut along, nastasya, and bring some tea, for tea we may venture on without the faculty. but here is the beer!â€ he moved back to his chair, pulled the soup and meat in front of him, and began eating as though he had not touched food for three days.
â€œi must tell you, rodya, i dine like this here every day now,â€ he mumbled with his mouth full of beef, â€œand itâ€™s all pashenka, your dear little landlady, who sees to that; she loves to do anything for me. i donâ€™t ask for it, but, of course, i donâ€™t object. and hereâ€™s nastasya with the tea. she is a quick girl. nastasya, my dear, wonâ€™t you have some beer?â€

â€œpashenka must give us some raspberry jam to-day to make him some raspberry tea,â€ said razumihin, going back to his chair and attacking his soup and beer again.
â€œand where is she to get raspberries for you?â€ asked nastasya, balancing a saucer on her five outspread fingers and sipping tea through a lump of sugar.
â€œsheâ€™ll get it at the shop, my dear. you see, rodya, all sorts of things have been happening while you have been laid up. when you decamped in that rascally way without leaving your address, i felt so angry that i resolved to find you out and punish you. i set to work that very day. how i ran about making inquiries for you! this lodging of yours i had forgotten, though i never remembered it, indeed, because i did not know it; and as for your old lodgings, i could only remember it was at the five corners, harlamovâ€™s house. i kept trying to find

â€œyes, you did very sensibly. but the worst of it is that at that point mr. tchebarov turns up, a business man. pashenka would never have thought of doing anything on her own account, she is too retiring; but the business man is by no means retiring, and first thing he puts the question, â€˜is there any hope of realising the i o u?â€™ answer: there is, because he has a mother who would save her rodya with her hundred and twenty-five roubles pension, if she has to starve herself; and a sister, too, who would go into bondage for his sake. thatâ€™s what he was building upon.... why do you start? i know all the ins and outs of your affairs now, my dear boyâ€”itâ€™s not for nothing that you were so open with pashenka when you were her prospective son-in-law, and i say all this as a friend.... but i tell you what it is; an honest and sensitive man is open; and a business man â€˜listens and goes o

â€œtwenty copecks, no more, i dare say,â€ answered nastasya.
â€œtwenty copecks, silly!â€ he cried, offended. â€œwhy, nowadays you would cost more than thatâ€”eighty copecks! and that only because it has been worn. and itâ€™s bought on condition that whenâ€™s itâ€™s worn out, they will give you another next year. yes, on my word! well, now let us pass to the united states of america

 interrupted nastasyaâ€™s chatter with marked displeasure. she sighed and was silent.
â€œwhy, he was accused of the murder,â€ razumihin went on hotly.
â€œwas there evidence against him then?â€
â€œevidence, indeed! evidence that was no evidence, and thatâ€™s what we have to prove. it was just as they pitched on those fellows, koch and pestryakov, at first. foo! how stupidly itâ€™s all done, it makes one sick, though itâ€™s not oneâ€™s business! pestryakov may be coming to-night.... by the way, rodya, youâ€™ve heard about the business already; it happened before you were ill, the day before you fainted at the police office while they were talking about it.â€
zossimov looked curiously at raskolnikov. he did not stir.
â€œbut i say, razumihin, i wonder at you. what a busybody you are!â€ zossimov observed.
â€œmaybe i am, but we will get him off anyway,â€ shouted razumihin, bringing his fist down on the table. â€œwhatâ€™s the most offensive is not their lyingâ€”one can always forgive lyingâ€”

he moved his chair back from the table, made a little space between the table and his knees, and waited in a rather cramped position for the visitor to â€œthread his way in.â€ the minute was so chosen that it was impossible to refuse, and the visitor squeezed his way through, hurrying and stumbling. reaching the chair, he sat down, looking suspiciously at razumihin.
â€œno need to be nervous,â€ the latter blurted out. â€œrodya has been ill for the last five days and delirious for three, but now he is recovering and has got an appetite. this is his doctor, who has just had a look at him. i am a comrade of rodyaâ€™s, like him, formerly a student, and now i am nursing him; so donâ€™t you take any notice of us, but go on with your business.â€

â€œso here you are!â€ he shouted at the top of his voiceâ€”â€œyou ran away from your bed! and here iâ€™ve been looking for you under the sofa! we went up to the garret. i almost beat nastasya on your account. and here he is after all. rodya! what is the meaning of it? tell me the whole truth! confess! do you hear?â€
â€œit means that iâ€™m sick to death of you all and i want to be alone,â€ raskolnikov answered calmly.
â€œalone? when you are not able to walk, when your face is as white as a sheet and you are gasping for breath! idiot!... what have you been doing in the palais de cristal? own up at once!â€

â€œwhat do you mean? i am coming with you, weâ€™ll come in together!â€

they began mounting the stairs, and the idea struck razumihin that perhaps zossimov might be right after all. â€œah, iâ€™ve upset him with my chatter!â€ he muttered to himself.
when they reached the door they heard voices in the room.

and seizing dounia by the arm so that he almost dislocated it, he made her bend down to see that â€œhe is all right again.â€ the mother and sister looked on him with emotion and gratitude, as their providence. they had heard already from nastasya all that had been done for their rodya during his illness, by this â€œvery competent young man,â€ as pulcheria alexandrovna raskolnikov called him that evening in conversation with dounia.




part iii





chapter i

raskolnikov got up, and sat down on the sofa. he waved his hand weakly to razumihin to cut short the flow of warm and incoherent consolations he was addressing to his mother and sister, took them both by the hand and for a minute or two gazed from one to the other without speaking. his mother was alarmed by his expres

sion. it revealed an emotion agonisingly poignant, and at the same time something immovable, almost insane. pulcheria alexandrovna began to cry.
avdotya romanovna was pale; her hand trembled in her brotherâ€™s.
â€œgo home... with him,â€ he said in a broken voice, pointing to razumihin, â€œgood-bye till to-morrow; to-morrow everything... is it long since you arrived?â€
â€œthis evening, rodya,â€ answered pulcheria alexandrovna, â€œthe train was awfully late. but, rodya, nothing would induce me to leave you now! i will spend the night here, near you...â€
â€œdonâ€™t torture me!â€ he said with a gesture of irritation.
â€œi will stay with him,â€ cried razumihin, â€œi wonâ€™t leave him for a moment. bother all my visitors! let them rage to their heartsâ€™ content! my uncle is presiding there.â€
â€œhow, how can i thank you!â€ pulcheria alexandrovna was beginning, once more pressing razumihinâ€™s hands, but raskolnikov interrupted her again.
â€œi canâ€™t have i

â€œcome, mamma, come out of the room at least for a minute,â€ dounia whispered in dismay; â€œwe are distressing him, thatâ€™s evident.â€
â€œmaynâ€™t i look at him after three years?â€ wept pulcheria alexandrovna.
â€œstay,â€ he stopped them again, â€œyou keep interrupting me, and my ideas get muddled.... have you seen luzhin?â€
â€œno, rodya, but he knows already of our arrival. we have heard, rodya, that pyotr petrovitch was so kind as to visit you today,â€ pulcheria alexandrovna added somewhat timidly.
â€œyes... he was so kind... dounia, i promised luzhin iâ€™d throw him downstairs and told him to go to hell....â€
â€œrodya, what are you saying! surely, you donâ€™t mean to tell us...â€ pulcheria alexandrovna began in alarm, but she stopped, looking at dounia.
avdotya romanovna was looking attentively at her brother, waiting for

â€œhe is raving,â€ razumihin cried tipsily, â€œor how would he dare! to-morrow all this nonsense will be over... to-day he certainly did drive him away. that was so. and luzhin got angry, too.... he made speeches here, wanted to show off his learning and he went out crest-fallen....â€
â€œthen itâ€™s true?â€ cried pulcheria alexandrovna.
â€œgood-bye till to-morrow, brother,â€ said dounia compassionatelyâ€”â€œlet us go, mother... good-bye, rodya.â€
â€œdo you hear, sister,â€ he repeated after them, making a last effort, â€œi am not delirious; this marriage isâ€”an infamy. let me act like a scoundrel, but you mustnâ€™t... one is enough... and though i am a scoundrel, i wouldnâ€™t own such a sister. itâ€™s me or luzhin! go now....â€
â€œbut youâ€™re out of your mind! despot!â€ roared razumihin; but raskolnikov did not and perhaps could not answer. he lay down on the sofa, and turned to the wall, utterly exhausted. avdotya romanovna loo

ully as in a vise. he stared at avdotya romanovna without the least regard for good manners. they sometimes pulled their hands out of his huge bony paws, but far from noticing what was the matter, he drew them all the closer to him. if theyâ€™d told him to jump head foremost from the staircase, he would have done it without thought or hesitation in their service. though pulcheria alexandrovna felt that the young man was really too eccentric and pinched her hand too much, in her anxiety over her rodya she looked on his presence as providential, and was unwilling to notice all his peculiarities. but though avdotya romanovna shared her anxiety, and was not of timorous disposition, she could not see the glowing light in his eyes without wonder and almost alarm. it was only the unbounded confidence inspired by nastasyaâ€™s account of her brotherâ€™s queer friend, which prevented her from trying to run away from him, and to persuade her mother to do the same. she realised, too, that even running

â€œlet us go, mother,â€ said avdotya romanovna, â€œhe will certainly do what he has promised. he has saved rodya already, and if the doctor really will consent to spend the night here, what could be better?â€
â€œyou see, you... you... understand me, because you are an angel!â€ razumihin cried in ecstasy, â€œlet us go! nastasya! fly upstairs and sit with him with a light; iâ€™ll come in a quarter of an hour.â€
though pulcheria alexandrovna was not perfectly convinced, she made no further resistance. razumihin gave an arm to each and drew them down the stairs. he still made her uneasy, as though he was c

â€œnot for anything till you let me kiss your hands! thatâ€™s it! enough! i get up and weâ€™ll go on! i am a luckless fool, i am unworthy of you and drunk... and i am ashamed.... i am not worthy to love you, but to do homage to you is the duty of every man who is not a perfect beast! and iâ€™ve done homage.... here are your lodgings, and for that alone rodya was right in driving your pyotr petrovitch away.... how dare he! how dare he put you in such lodgings! itâ€™s a scandal! do you know the sort of people they take in here? and you his betrothed! you are his betrothed? yes? well, then, iâ€™ll tell you, your fiancÃ© is a scoundrel.â€
â€œexcuse me, mr. razumihin, you are forgetting...â€ pulcheria alexandrovna was beginning.

â€œgood heavens, dounia, what is going to happen?â€ said pulcheria alexandrovna, addressing her daughter with anxiety and dismay.
â€œdonâ€™t worry yourself, mother,â€ said dounia, taking off her hat and cape. â€œgod has sent this gentleman to our aid, though he has come from a drinking party. we can depend on him, i assure you. and all that he has done for rodya....â€
â€œah. dounia, goodness knows whether he will come! how could i bring myself to leave rodya?... and how different, how different i had fancied our meeting! how sullen he was, as though not pleased to see us....â€
tears came into her eyes.
â€œno, itâ€™s not that, mother. you didnâ€™t see, you were crying all the time. he is quite unhinged by serious illnessâ€”thatâ€™s the reason.â€
â€œah, that illness! what will happen, what will happen? and how he talked to you, dounia!â€ said the mot

hearing that everything was going well and that rodya had not yet waked, pulcheria alexandrovna declared that she was glad to hear it, because â€œshe had something which it was very, very necessary to talk over beforehand.â€ then followed an inquiry about breakfast and an invitation to have it with them; they had waited to have it with him. avdotya romanovna rang the bell: it was answered by a ragged dirty waiter, and they asked him to bring tea which was served at last, but in such a dirty and disorderly way that the ladies were ashamed. razumih

â€œgod grant it may,â€ cried pulcheria alexandrovna, distressed by razumihinâ€™s account of her rodya.
and razumihin ventured to look more boldly at avdotya romanovna at last. he glanced at her often while he was talking, but only for a moment and looked away again at once. avdotya romanovna sat at the table, listening attentively, then got up again and began walking to and fro with her arms folded and her lips compressed, occasionally putting in a question, without stopping her walk. she had the same habit of not listening to what was said. she was wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and she ha

â€œhe loves no one and perhaps he never will,â€ razumihin declared decisively.
â€œyou mean he is not capable of love?â€
â€œdo you know, avdotya romanovna, you are awfully like your brother, in everything, indeed!â€ he blurted out suddenly to his own surprise, but remembering at once what he had just before said of her brother, he turned as red as a crab and was overcome with confusion. avdotya romanovna couldnâ€™t help laughing when she looked at him.
â€œyou may both be mistaken about rodya,â€ pulcheria alexandrovna remarked, slightly piqued. â€œi am not talking of our present difficulty, dounia. what pyotr petrovitch writes in this letter and what you and i have supposed may be mistaken, but you canâ€™t imagine, dmitri prokofitch, how moody and, so to say, capricious he is. i never could depend on what he would do when he was only fifteen. and i am sure that he might do something now that nobody else would think of doing... well, for instance, do you know how a year and a half a

 petrovitch in reply to our letter announcing our arrival. he promised to meet us at the station, you know; instead of that he sent a servant to bring us the address of these lodgings and to show us the way; and he sent a message that he would be here himself this morning. but this morning this note came from him. youâ€™d better read it yourself; there is one point in it which worries me very much... you will soon see what that is, and... tell me your candid opinion, dmitri prokofitch! you know rodyaâ€™s character better than anyone and no one can advise us better than you can. dounia, i must tell you, made her decision at once, but i still donâ€™t feel sure how to act and i... iâ€™ve been waiting for your opinion.â€
razumihin opened the note which was dated the previous evening and read as follows:

â€œyour humble servant,

â€œwhat am i to do now, dmitri prokofitch?â€ began pulcheria alexandrovna, almost weeping. â€œhow can i ask rodya not to come? yesterday he insisted so earnestly on our refusing pyotr petrovitch and now we are ordered not to receive rodya! he will come on purpose if he knows, and... what will happen then?â€
â€œact on avdotya romanovnaâ€™s decision,â€ razumihin answered calmly at once.

dent poverty gave the two ladies an air of special dignity, which is always found in people who know how to wear poor clothes. razumihin looked reverently at dounia and felt proud of escorting her. â€œthe queen who mended her stockings in prison,â€ he thought, â€œmust have looked then every inch a queen and even more a queen than at sumptuous banquets and levÃ©es.â€
â€œmy god!â€ exclaimed pulcheria alexandrovna, â€œlittle did i think that i should ever fear seeing my son, my darling, darling rodya! i am afraid, dmitri prokofitch,â€ she added, glancing at him timidly.
â€œdonâ€™t be afraid, mother,â€ said dounia, kissing her, â€œbetter have faith in him.â€
â€œoh, dear, i have faith in him, but i havenâ€™t slept all night,â€ exclaimed the poor woman.

zossimov, who had begun his sage advice partly to make an effect before the ladies, was certainly somewhat mystified, when, glancing at his patient, he observed unmistakable mockery on his face. this lasted an instant, however. pulcheria alexandrovna began at once thanking zossimov, especially for his visit to their lodging the previous night.
â€œwhat! he saw you last night?â€ raskolnikov asked, as though startled. â€œthen you have not slept either after your journey.â€
â€œach, rodya, that was only till two oâ€™clock. dounia and i never go to bed before two at home.â€
â€œi donâ€™t know how to thank him either,â€ raskolnikov went on, suddenly frowning and looking down. â€œsetting aside the question of paymentâ€”forgive me for referring to it (he turned to zossimov)â€”i really donâ€™t know what i have done to deserve such special attention from you! i simply donâ€™t understand it... and... and... it weighs upon me, indeed, because i donâ€™t understand it. i tell you so cand

â€œoh, rodya, you wouldnâ€™t believe,â€ she began suddenly, in haste to answer his words to her, â€œhow unhappy dounia and i were yesterday! now that itâ€™s all over and done with and we are quite happy againâ€”i can tell you. fancy, we ran here almost straight from the train to embrace you and that womanâ€”ah, here she is! good morning, nastasya!... she told us at once that you were lying in a high fever and had just run away from the doctor in delirium, and they were looking for you in the streets. you c

â€œwhat else was it i wanted to say?â€ he went on trying to recollect. â€œoh, yes; mother, and you too, dounia, please donâ€™t think that i didnâ€™t mean to come and see you to-day and was waiting for you to come first.â€
â€œwhat are you saying, rodya?â€ cried pulcheria alexandrovna. she, too, was surprised.
â€œis he answering us as a duty?â€ dounia wondered. â€œis he being reconciled and asking forgiveness as though he were performing a rite or repeating a lesson?â€
â€œiâ€™ve only just waked up, and wanted to go to you, but was delayed owing to my clothes; i forgot yesterday to ask her... nastasya... to wash out the blood... iâ€™ve only just dressed.â€

â€œthatâ€™s enough, rodya, i am sure that everything you do is very good,â€ said his mother, delighted.
â€œdonâ€™t be too sure,â€ he answered, twisting his mouth into a smile.
a silence followed. there was a certain constraint in all this conversation, and in the silence, and in the reconciliation, and in the forgiveness, and all were feeling it.
â€œit is as though they were afraid of me,â€ raskolnikov was thinking to himself, looking askance at his mother and sister. pulcheria alexandrovna was indeed growing more ti

â€œwhat marfa petrovna?â€
â€œoh, mercy on usâ€”marfa petrovna svidrigaÃ¯lov. i wrote you so much about her.â€
â€œa-a-h! yes, i remember.... so sheâ€™s dead! oh, really?â€ he roused himself suddenly, as if waking up. â€œwhat did she die of?â€

â€œah, my dear, i donâ€™t know what to talk about,â€ broke from pulcheria alexandrovna.
â€œwhy, are you all afraid of me?â€ he asked, with a constrained smile.
â€œthatâ€™s certainly true,â€ said dounia, looking directly and sternly at her brother. â€œmother was crossing herself with terror as she came up the stairs.â€
his face worked, as though in convulsion.
â€œach, what are you saying, dounia! donâ€™t be angry, please, rodya.... why did you say that, dounia?â€ pulcheria alexandrovna began, overwhelmedâ€”â€œyou see, coming here, i was dreaming all the way, in the train, how we should meet, how we should talk over everything together.... and i was so happy, i did not notice the journey! but what am i saying? i am happy now.... you should not, dounia.... i am happy nowâ€”simply in seeing you, rodya....â€

he sat down again, and began looking about him, in silence. they were all looking at him in perplexity.
â€œbut what are you all so dull for?â€ he shouted, suddenly and quite unexpectedly. â€œdo say something! whatâ€™s the use of sitting like this? come, do speak. let us talk.... we meet together and sit in silence.... come, anything!â€
â€œthank god; i was afraid the same thing as yesterday was beginning again,â€ said pulcheria alexandrovna, crossing herself.
â€œwhat is the matter, rodya?â€ asked avdotya romanovna, distrustfully.
â€œoh, nothing! i remembered something,â€ he answered, and suddenly laughed.
â€œwell, if you remembered something; thatâ€™s all right!... i was beginning to think...â€ muttered zossimov, getting up from the sofa. â€œit is time for me to be off. i will look in again perhaps... if i can...â€ he made his bows, and went out.

â€œwhat a wretched lodging you have, rodya! itâ€™s like a tomb,â€ said pulcheria alexandrovna, suddenly breaking the oppressive silence. â€œi am sure itâ€™s quite half through your lodging you have become so melancholy.â€
â€œmy lodging,â€ he answered, listlessly. â€œyes, the lodging had a great deal to do with it.... i thought that, too.... if only you knew, though, what a strange thing you said just now, mother,â€ he said, laughing strangely.

â€œrodya, rodya! it is the same as yesterday again,â€ pulcheria alexandrovna cried, mournfully. â€œand why do you call yourself a scoundrel? i canâ€™t bear it. you said the same yesterday.â€
â€œbrother,â€ dounia answered firmly and with the same dryness. â€œin all this there is a mistake on your part. i thought it over at night, and found out the mistake. it is all because you seem to fancy i am sacrificing myself to someone and for someone. that is not the case at all. i am simply marrying for my ow

â€œgood heavens! you have made him faint,â€ cried pulcheria alexandrovna.
â€œno, no, nonsense! itâ€™s nothing. a little giddinessâ€”not fainting. you have fainting on the brain. hâ€™m, yes, what was i saying? oh, yes. in what way will you get convincing proof to-day that you can respect him, and that he... esteems you, as you said. i think you said to-day?â€

all indeed expected something particular.
â€œwhat surprises me,â€ he began, after a short pause, handing the letter to his mother, but not addressing anyone in particular, â€œis that he is a business man, a lawyer, and his conversation is pretentious indeed, and yet he writes such an uneducated letter.â€
they all started. they had expected something quite different.
â€œbut they all write like that, you know,â€ razumihin observed, abruptly.
â€œhave you read it?â€
â€œyes.â€
â€œwe showed him, rodya. we... consulted him just now,â€ pulcheria alexandrovna began, embarrassed.
â€œthatâ€™s just the jargon of the courts,â€ razumihin put in. â€œlegal documents are written like that to this day.â€
â€œlegal? yes, itâ€™s just legalâ€”business languageâ€”not so very uneducated, and not quite educatedâ€”business language!â€

dounia did not reply. her resolution had been taken. she was only awaiting the evening.
â€œthen what is your decision, rodya?â€ asked pulcheria alexandrovna, who was more uneasy than ever at the sudden, new businesslike tone of his talk.
â€œwhat decision?â€
â€œyou see pyotr petrovitch writes that you are not to be with us this evening, and that he will go away if you come. so will you... come?â€
â€œthat, of course, is not for me to decide, but for you first, if you are not offended by such a request; and secondly, by dounia, if she, too, is not offended. i will do what you think best,â€ he added, drily.

â€œyes.â€
â€œi will ask you, too, to be with us at eight oâ€™clock,â€ she said, addressing razumihin. â€œmother, i am inviting him, too.â€
â€œquite right, dounia. well, since you have decided,â€ added pulcheria alexandrovna, â€œso be it. i shall feel easier myself. i do not like concealment and deception. better let us have the whole truth.... pyotr petrovitch may be angry or not, now!â€

pulcheria alexandrovna glanced at sonia, and slightly screwed up her eyes. in spite of her embarrassment before rodyaâ€™s urgent and challenging look, she could not deny herself that satisfaction. dounia gazed gravely and intently into the poor girlâ€™s face, and scrutinised her with perplexity. sonia, hearing herself introduced, tried to raise her eyes again, but was more embarrassed than ever.
â€œi wanted to ask you,â€ said raskolnikov, hastily, â€œhow things were arranged yesterday. you were not worried by the police, for instance?â€
â€œno, that was all right... it was too evident, the cause of death... t

â€œyou gave us everything yesterday,â€ sonia said suddenly, in reply, in a loud rapid whisper; and again she looked down in confusion. her lips and chin were trembling once more. she had been struck at once by raskolnikovâ€™s poor surroundings, and now these words broke out spontaneously. a silence followed. there was a light in douniaâ€™s eyes, and even pulcheria alexandrovna looked kindly at sonia.
â€œrodya,â€ she said, getting up, â€œwe shall have dinner together, of course. come, dounia.... and you, rodya, had better go for a little walk, and then rest and lie down before you come to see us.... i am afraid we have exhausted you....â€
â€œyes, yes, iâ€™ll come,â€ he answered, getting up fussily. â€œbut i have something to see to.â€
â€œbut surely you will have dinner together?â€ cried razumihin, looking in surprise at raskolnikov. â€œwhat do you mean?â€
â€œyes, yes, i am coming... of course,

â€œoh, no, no. and will you, dmitri prokofitch, do us the favour of dining with us?â€
â€œplease do,â€ added dounia.
razumihin bowed, positively radiant. for one moment, they were all strangely embarrassed.
â€œgood-bye, rodya, that is till we meet. i do not like saying good-bye. good-bye, nastasya. ah, i have said good-bye again.â€
pulcheria alexandrovna meant to greet sonia, too; but it somehow failed to come off, and she went in a flutter out of the room.
but avdotya romanovna seemed to await her turn, and following her mother out, gave sonia an attentive, courteous bow. sonia, in confusion, gave a hurried, frightened curtsy. there was a look of poignant discomfort in her face, as though avdotya romanovnaâ€™s cou

â€œwhat? that they think i am a madman? maybe they are right,â€ he said with a constrained smile.
â€œyes, yes.... that is, pooh, no!... but all that i said (and there was something else too) it was all nonsense, drunken nonsense.â€

all this flashed like lightning through his mind.
porfiry petrovitch returned quickly. he became suddenly more jovial.
â€œyour party yesterday, brother, has left my head rather.... and i am out of sorts altogether,â€ he began in quite a different tone, laughing to razumihin.
â€œwas it interesting? i left you yesterday at the most interesting point. who got the best of it?â€
â€œoh, no one, of course. they got on to everlasting questions, floated off into space.â€
â€œonly fancy, rodya, what we got on to yesterday. whether there is such a thing as crime. i told you that we talked our heads off.â€
â€œwhat is there strange? itâ€™s an everyday social question,â€ raskolnikov answered casually.
â€œthe question wasnâ€™t put quite like that,â€ observed porfiry.
â€œnot quite, thatâ€™s true,â€ razumihin agreed at once, getting warm and hurried as usual. â€œlisten, rodion, and tell us your opinion, i want to hear it. i was fighting tooth and nail with them and wanted you to help me

â€œthatâ€™s true; but when it ceased to exist, the weekly review was amalgamated with the periodical, and so your article appeared two months ago in the latter. didnâ€™t you know?â€
raskolnikov had not known.
â€œwhy, you might get some money out of them for the article! what a strange person you are! you lead such a solitary life that you know nothing of matters that concern you directly. itâ€™s a fact, i assure you.â€
â€œbravo, rodya! i knew nothing about it either!â€ cried razumihin. â€œiâ€™ll run to-day to the reading-room and ask for the number. two months ago? what was the date? it doesnâ€™t matter though, i will find it. think of not telling us!â€
â€œhow did you find out that the article was mine? itâ€™s only signed with an initial.â€

â€œwhy, are you both joking?â€ razumihin cried at last. â€œthere you sit, making fun of one another. are you serious, rodya?â€
raskolnikov raised his pale and almost mournful face and made no reply. and the unconcealed, persistent, nervous, and discourteous sarcasm of porfiry seemed strange to razumihin beside that quiet and mournful face.
â€œwell, brother, if you are really serious... you are right, of course, in saying that itâ€™s not new, that itâ€™s like what weâ€™ve read and heard a thousand times already; but what is really original in all this, and is exclusively your own, to my horror, is that you sanction

â€œwhat do you mean?â€
â€œwhy, who can tell? perhaps i am really mad, and perhaps everything that happened all these days may be only imagination.â€
â€œach, rodya, you have been upset again!... but what did he say, what did he come for?â€
raskolnikov did not answer. razumihin thought a minute.
â€œnow let me tell you my story,â€ he began, â€œi came to you, you were asleep. then we had dinner and then i went to porfiryâ€™s, zametov was still with him. i tried to begin, but it was no use. i couldnâ€™t speak in the right way. they donâ€™t seem to understand and canâ€™t understand, but are not a bit ashamed. i drew porfiry to the window, and began talking t

assuming an aggrieved air, luzhin relapsed into dignified silence.
â€œyour request that my brother should not be present at our meeting was disregarded solely at my insistance,â€ said dounia. â€œyou wrote that you had been insulted by my brother; i think that this must be explained at once, and you must be reconciled. and if rodya really has insulted you, then he should and will apologise.â€
pyotr petrovitch took a stronger line.
â€œthere are insults, avdotya romanovna, which no goodwill can make us forget. there is a line in everything which it is dangerous to overstep; and when it has been overstepped, there is no return.â€

â€œi donâ€™t remember,â€ faltered pulcheria alexandrovna. â€œi repeated them as i understood them. i donâ€™t know how rodya repeated them to you, perhaps he exaggerated.â€
â€œhe could not have exaggerated them, except at your instigation.â€

â€œwould you go so far then as to let her associate with your mother and sister?â€
â€œi have done so already, if you care to know. i made her sit down to-day with mother and dounia.â€

â€œyou may see for yourself, avdotya romanovna,â€ he said, â€œwhether it is possible for us to agree. i hope now that this question is at an end, once and for all. i will withdraw, that i may not hinder the pleasures of family intimacy, and the discussion of secrets.â€ he got up from his chair and took his hat. â€œbut in withdrawing, i venture to request that for the future i may

â€œbut now in any case i cannot reckon on it, and i particularly desire not to hinder your discussion of the secret proposals of arkady ivanovitch svidrigaÃ¯lov, which he has entrusted to your brother and which have, i perceive, a great and possibly a very agreeable interest for you.â€
â€œgood heavens!â€ cried pulcheria alexandrovna.
razumihin could not sit still on his chair.
â€œarenâ€™t you ashamed now, sister?â€ asked raskolnikov.
â€œi am ashamed, rodya,â€ said dounia. â€œpyotr petrovitch, go away,â€ she turned to him, white with anger.
pyotr petrovitch had apparently not at all expected such a conclusion. he had too much confidence in himself, in his power and in the helplessness of his victims. he could not believe it even now. he turned pale, and his lips quivered.

â€œwhat answer did you give him?â€ asked dounia.
â€œat first i said i would not take any message to you. then he said that he would do his utmost to obtain an interview with you without my help. he assured me that his passion for you was a passing infatuation, now he has no feeling for you. he doesnâ€™t want you to marry luzhin.... his talk was altogether rather muddled.â€
â€œhow do you explain him to yourself, rodya? how did he strike you?â€
â€œi must confess i donâ€™t quite understand him. he offers you ten thousand, and yet says he is not well off. he says he is going away, and in ten minutes he forgets he has said it. then he says he is going to be married and has already fixed on the girl.... no doubt he has a motive, and probably a bad one. but itâ€™s odd that he should be so clumsy about it if he had any designs against you.... of course, i refused this money on your account, once for all. altogethe

dounia seemed strangely impressed by svidrigaÃ¯lovâ€™s offer. she still stood meditating.
â€œhe has got some terrible plan,â€ she said in a half whisper to herself, almost shuddering.
raskolnikov noticed this disproportionate terror.
â€œi fancy i shall have to see him more than once again,â€ he said to dounia.

dounia smiled and held out her hand, but the look of anxiety did not leave her face. pulcheria alexandrovna gazed at her timidly, but the three thousand roubles had obviously a soothing effect on her.

â€œi like what you are saying, dmitri prokofitch!â€ she said.
â€œi know nothing about it, of course,â€ put in pulcheria alexandrovna, â€œit may be a good idea, but again god knows. itâ€™s new and untried. of course, we must remain here at least for a time.â€ she looked at rodya.
â€œwhat do you think, brother?â€ said dounia.
â€œi think heâ€™s got a very good idea,â€ he answered. â€œof course, itâ€™s too soon to dream of a publishing firm, but we certainly might bring out five or six books and be sure of success. i know of one book myself which would be sure to go well. and as for his being able to manage it, thereâ€™s no doubt about that either. he knows the business.... but we can talk it over later....â€

dounia looked at her brother with incredulous wonder. he held his cap in his hand, he was preparing to leave them.

â€œwhat is the matter with you?â€ cried his mother.
â€œwhere are you going, rodya?â€ asked dounia rather strangely.
â€œoh, iâ€™m quite obliged to...â€ he answered vaguely, as though hesitating what he would say. but there was a look of sharp determination in his white face.
â€œi meant to say... as i was coming here... i meant to tell you, mother, and you, dounia, that it would be better for us to part for a time. i feel ill, i am not at peace.... i will come afterwards, i will come of myself... when itâ€™s possible. i remember you and love you.... leave me, leave me alone.

â€œgood god!â€ cried pulcheria alexandrovna. both his mother and his sister were terribly alarmed. razumihin was also.
â€œrodya, rodya, be reconciled with us! let us be as before!â€ cried his poor mother.
he turned slowly to the door and slowly went out of the room. dounia overtook him.
â€œbrother, what are you doing to mother?â€ she whispered, her eyes flashing with indignation.
he looked dully at her.
â€œno matter, i shall come.... iâ€™m coming,â€ he muttered in an undertone, as though not fully conscious of what he was saying, and he went out of the room.

â€œdo you understand now?â€ said raskolnikov, his face twitching nervously. â€œgo back, go to them,â€ he said suddenly, and turning quickly, he went out of the house.
i will not attempt to describe how razumihin went back to the ladies, how he soothed them, how he protested that rodya needed rest in his illness, protested that rodya was sure to come, that he would come every day, that he was very, very much upset, that he must not be irritated, that he, razumihin, would watch over him, would get him a doctor, the best doctor, a consultation.... in fact from that evening razumihin took his place with them as a son and a brother.

he went out.

he knocked at the door which was opened by his mother. dounia was not at home. even the servant happened to be out. at first pulcheria alexandrovna was speechless with joy and surprise; then she took him by the hand and drew him into the room.
â€œhere you are!â€ she began, faltering with joy. â€œdonâ€™t be angry with me, rodya, for welcoming you so foolishly with tears: i am laughing not crying. did you think i was crying? no, i am delighted, but iâ€™ve got into such a stupid habit of shedding tears. iâ€™ve been like that ever since your fatherâ€™s death. i cry for anything. sit down, dear boy, you must be tired; i see you are. ah, how muddy you are.â€

gazine and glanced at his article. incongruous as it was with his mood and his circumstances, he felt that strange and bitter sweet sensation that every author experiences the first time he sees himself in print; besides, he was only twenty-three. it lasted only a moment. after reading a few lines he frowned and his heart throbbed with anguish. he recalled all the inward conflict of the preceding months. he flung the article on the table with disgust and anger.

â€œno, rodya. i often donâ€™t see her; she leaves me alone. dmitri prokofitch comes to see me, itâ€™s so good of him, and he always talks about you. he loves you and respects you, my dear. i donâ€™t say that dounia is very wanting in consideration. i am not complaining. she has her ways and i have mine; she seems to have got some secrets of late and i never have any secrets from you two. of course, i am sure that dounia has far too much sense, and besides she loves you and me... but i donâ€™t know what it w

â€œiâ€™ve come to assure you that iâ€™ve always loved you and i am glad that we are alone, even glad dounia is out,â€ he went on with the same impulse. â€œi have come to tell you that though you will be unhappy, you must believe that your son loves you now more than himself, and that all you thought about me, that i was c

ruel and didnâ€™t care about you, was all a mistake. i shall never cease to love you.... well, thatâ€™s enough: i thought i must do this and begin with this....â€
pulcheria alexandrovna embraced him in silence, pressing him to her bosom and weeping gently.
â€œi donâ€™t know what is wrong with you, rodya,â€ she said at last. â€œiâ€™ve been thinking all this time that we were simply boring you and now i see that there is a great sorrow in store for you, and thatâ€™s why you are miserable. iâ€™ve foreseen it a long time, rodya. forgive me for speaking about it. i keep thinking about it and lie awake at nights. your sister lay talking in her sleep all last night, talking of nothing but you. i caught something, but i couldnâ€™t make it out. i felt all the morning as though i were going to be hange

d, waiting for something, expecting something, and now it has come! rodya, rodya, where are you going? you are going away somewhere?â€
â€œyes.â€
â€œthatâ€™s what i thought! i can come with you, you know, if you need me. and dounia, too; she loves you, she loves you dearlyâ€”and sofya semyonovna may come with us if you like. you see, i am glad to look upon her as a daughter even... dmitri prokofitch will help us to go together. but... where... are you going?â€
â€œgood-bye, mother.â€
â€œwhat, to-day?â€ she cried, as though losing him for ever.

yes, he was glad, he was very glad that there was no one there, that he was alone with his mother. for the first time after all those awful months his heart was softened. he fell down before her, he kissed her feet and both wept, embracing. and she was not surprised and did not question him this time. for some days she had realised that something awful was happening to her son and that now some terrible minute had come for him.
â€œrodya, my darling, my first born,â€ she said sobbing, â€œnow you are just as when you were little. you would run like this to me and hug me and kiss me. when your father was living and we were poor, you comforted us simply by being with us and when i buried your father, how often we wept together at his grave and embraced, as now. and if iâ€™ve been crying lately, itâ€™s that my motherâ€™s heart had a foreboding of trouble. the first time i saw you, that evening, you remember, as soon as we arrived

here, i guessed simply from your eyes. my heart sank at once, and to-day when i opened the door and looked at you, i thought the fatal hour had come. rodya, rodya, you are not going away to-day?â€
â€œno!â€
â€œyouâ€™ll come again?â€
â€œyes... iâ€™ll come.â€
â€œrodya, donâ€™t be angry, i donâ€™t dare to question you. i know i mustnâ€™t. only say two words to meâ€”is it far where you are going?â€
â€œvery far.â€
â€œwhat is awaiting you there? some post or career for you?â€
â€œwhat god sends... only pray for me.â€ raskolnikov went to the door, but she clutched him and gazed despairingly into his eyes. her face worked with terror.
â€œenough, mother,â€ said raskolnikov, deeply regretting that he had come.
â€œnot for ever, itâ€™s not yet for ever? youâ€™ll c

derstands it already. perhaps i did wrong in going to see her. i donâ€™t know why i did go. i am a contemptible person, dounia.â€
â€œa contemptible person, but ready to face suffering! you are, arenâ€™t you?â€
â€œyes, i am going. at once. yes, to escape the disgrace i thought of drowning myself, dounia, but as i looked into the water, i thought that if i had considered myself strong till now iâ€™d better not be afraid of disgrace,â€ he said, hurrying on. â€œitâ€™s pride, dounia.â€
â€œpride, rodya.â€
there was a gleam of fire in his lustreless eyes; he seemed to be glad to think that he was still proud.
â€œyou donâ€™t think, sister, that i was simply afraid of the water?â€ he asked, looking into her face with a sinister smile.
â€œoh, rodya, hush!â€ cried dounia bitterly. silence lasted for two minutes. he sat with his eyes fixed on the floor; dounia stood at the other end of the table and looked at him with anguish. suddenly he got up.
â€œitâ€™s late, itâ€™s time to go! i am going at

but they were struck by the fact that pulcheria alexandrovna never asked them anything on the subject, neither then nor thereafter. on the contrary, she had her own version of her sonâ€™s sudden departure; she told them with tears how he had come to say good-bye to her, hinting that she alone knew many mysterious and important facts, and that rodya had many very powerful enemies, so that it was necessary for him to be in hiding. as for his future career, she had no doubt that it would be brilliant when certain sinister influences could be removed. she assured razumihin that her son would be one day a great statesman, that his article and brilliant literary talent proved it. this article she was continually reading, she even read it aloud, almost took it to bed with her, but scarcely asked where rodya was, though the subject was obviously

avoided by the others, which might have been enough to awaken her suspicions.
they began to be frightened at last at pulcheria alexandrovnaâ€™s strange silence on certain subjects. she did not, for instance, complain of getting no letters from him, though in previous years she had only lived on the hope of letters from her beloved rodya. this was the cause of great uneasiness to dounia; the idea occurred to her that her mother suspected that there was something terrible in her sonâ€™s fate and was afraid to ask, for fear of hearing something still more awful. in any case, dounia saw clearly that her mother was not in full possession of her faculties.
it happened once or twice, however, that pulcheria alexandrovna gave such a turn to the conversation that it was impossible to answer her without mentioning where rodya was, and o

ison as often as it was possible. at last the moment of separation came. dounia swore to her brother that the separation should not be for ever, razumihin did the same. razumihin, in his youthful ardour, had firmly resolved to lay the foundations at least of a secure livelihood during the next three or four years, and saving up a certain sum, to emigrate to siberia, a country rich in every natural resource and in need of workers, active men and capital. there they would settle in the town where rodya was and all together would begin a new life. they all wept at parting.
raskolnikov had been very dreamy for a few days before. he asked a great deal about his mother and was constantly anxious about her. he worried so much about her that it alarmed dounia. when he heard about his motherâ€™s illness he became very gloomy. with sonia he was particularly reserved all the time. with the help of the money left to her by svidrigaÃ¯lov, sonia had long ago made her preparations to follow the party of c

nia did not know how to restrain her. apart from the danger of her morbid excitement, there was the risk of someoneâ€™s recalling raskolnikovâ€™s name and speaking of the recent trial. pulcheria alexandrovna found out the address of the mother of the two children her son had saved and insisted on going to see her.
at last her restlessness reached an extreme point. she would sometimes begin to cry suddenly and was often ill and feverishly delirious. one morning she declared that by her reckoning rodya ought soon to be home, that she remembered when he said good-bye to her he said that they must expect him back in nine months. she began to prepare for his coming, began to do up her room for him, to clean the furniture, to wash and put up new hangings and so on. dounia was anxious, but said nothing and helped her to arrange the room. after a fatiguing day spent in continual fancies, in joyful day-dreams and tears, pulcheria alexandrovna was taken ill in the night and by morning she was feveris
