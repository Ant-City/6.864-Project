vered breasts, the heart with
letters on it shining like a light bulb through the trim hole painted in the chest, art
history.
i find the others in the small chilly room labelled bar; theyâ€™re the only customers.
they have six beer bottles and four glasses on their orange formica-topped table. a
mottled boy with a haircut like the ones of the men in the store, only blonde, is
sitting with them.
david waves at me as i come in: heâ€™s happy about something. â€œhave a beer,â€ he
says. â€œthis is claude, his father owns this joint.â€
claude shambles off morosely to get me a beer. underneath the bar itself is a
crudely carved wooden fish with red and blue dots on it, intended possibly for a
speckled trout; on its leaping back it supports the fake marble surface. above the bar
is a t.v., turned off or broken, and the regulation picture, scrolled gilt frame, blownup
photograph of a stream with trees and rapids and a man fishing. itâ€™s an imitation
of other places, more southern ones, which are

someoneâ€™s distorted memory of a nineteenth century english gentlemanâ€™s shooting
lodge, the kind with trophy heads and furniture made from deer antlers, queen
victoria had a set like that. but if this is what succeeds why shouldnâ€™t they do it?
â€œclaude told us business is bad this year,â€ david says, â€œon accounta word is
around the lakeâ€™s fished out. theyâ€™re going to other lakes, claudeâ€™s dad flies them
in his seaplane, neat eh? but he says some of the men went out in the spring with a
dragnet and thereâ€™s all kinds of them down there, real big ones, theyâ€™re just gettinâ€™
too smart.â€ david is slipping into his yokel dialect; he does it for fun, itâ€™s a parody
of himself, the way he says he talked back in the fifties when he wanted to be a
minister and was selling bibles door-to-door to put himself through theological
seminary: â€œhey lady, wanna buy a dirty book?â€ n

ow though it seems to be
unconscious, maybe heâ€™s doing it for claude, to make it clear he too is a man of the
people. or maybe itâ€™s an experiment in communications, thatâ€™s what he teaches, at
night, the same place joe works; itâ€™s an adult education programme. david calls it
adult vegetation; he got the job because he was once a radio announcer.
â€œany news?â€ joe asks, in a neutral mumble that signals heâ€™d prefer it if i kept
from showing any reaction, no matter what has happened.
â€œno,â€ i say, â€œnothing different.â€ voice level, calm. perhaps that

t he liked
about me, there must have been something, though i canâ€™t reconstruct our first
meeting, now i can: it was in a store, i was buying some new brushes and a spray tin
of fixative. he said do you live around here and we went to the corner for a coffee,
except i had a 7-up instead. what impressed him that time, he even mentioned it
later, cool he called it, was the way i took off my clothes and put them on again later
very smoothly as if i were feeling no emotion. but i really wasnâ€™t.
claude comes back with the beer and i say â€œthank youâ€ and glance up at him and
his face dissolves and re-forms, he was about eight the last time i was here; he used
to peddle worms in rusted tin cans to the fishermen down by the government dock.
heâ€™s uneasy now, he can tell i recognize him.
â€œiâ€™d like to go down the lake for a couple of days,â€ i say, to david because itâ€™s his
car. â€œiâ€™d like to look around, if thatâ€™s okay.â€
â€œgreat,â€ says david, â€œiâ€™m gonna get me one of them

hat was the unpardonable sin; it was no use
trying to explain to them why it wasnâ€™t really mine. but i admit i was stupid,
stupidity is the same as evil if you judge by the results, and i didnâ€™t have any
excuses, i was never good at them. my brother was, he used to make them up in
advance of the transgressions; thatâ€™s the logical way.
â€œoh god,â€ anna says, â€œdavid thinks heâ€™s a great white hunter.â€ sheâ€™s teasing him,
she does that a lot; but he doesnâ€™t hear, heâ€™s getting up, claude is hustling him off to
make him out a licence, it seems claude is in charge of the licences. when david
comes back i want to ask how much he paid, but heâ€™s too pleased, i donâ€™t want to
spoil it. claude is pleased also.
we find out from claude we can hire evans, who owns the blue moon cabins, to
run us down the lake. paul would take us for nothing, he offered, but i wouldnâ€™t feel
right about it; also iâ€™m sure he would misinterpret joeâ€™s amorphous beard and
davidâ€™s moustache and three

€™s having no luck. just as annaâ€™s beginning to fidget
again i hear a whine, motorboat. i listen, it may be going somewhere else, but it
rounds a point and becomes a roar, homing in on us, big powerboat, the white water
veeing from the bow. the engine cuts and it skids in beside us, its wash rocking us
sharply. american flag on the front and another at the back, two irritated-looking
businessmen with pug-dog faces and nifty outfits and a thin shabby man from the
village, guiding. i see itâ€™s claude from the motel, he scowls at us, he feels weâ€™re
poaching on his preserve.
â€œgetting any?â€ one of the americans yells, teeth bared, friendly as a shark.
i say â€œnoâ€ and nudge david with my foot. heâ€™d want to tell, if only to spite them.
the other american throws his cigar butt over the side. â€œthis donâ€™t look like
much of a place,â€ he says to claude.
â€œused to be,â€ claude says.
â€œnext year iâ€™m goinâ€™ to florida,â€ the first american says.
â€œreel in,â€ i say to david. the

ike the ones driven by the game wardens, they were
checking us the way they used to, to see if we had any dead fish and a licence to go
with them; it was routine.
the launch slowed and drew into the dock. david was down there anyway, i
would let him meet it, he was the one with the papers. i re-entered the house and
stood by the window. anna, inquisitive, sauntered down to join them.
there were two men, police or probably game wardens, they were wearing
ordinary clothes; and a third man, blond, claude from the village probably, and a
fourth one, older, the size of paul. it was odd that paul was on the launch: if he were
coming for a visit he would bring his own boat. david shook hands with them and
they clustered on the dock, talking in low voices. david dug into his pocket, for the
licence; then he scratched his neck as if worried. joe appeared from the outhouse
path and the talking started over again; annaâ€™s head turned up towards me.
then i saw david hurrying, taking the hill steps two

flapping. they cluster, they chitter and sizzle like a speeded-up tape, the forks and
spoons on the ends of their arms waving excitedly. perhaps they think i drowned
myself, that would be the kind of blunder they would make.
keep quiet i say, i bite into my arm but i canâ€™t hold it back, the laughter extrudes.
it startles me, i stop at once but itâ€™s too late, theyâ€™ve heard me. rubber feet stomping
off the dock and bulletproof heads moving towards me, who could they be, david
and joe, claude from the village, evans, malmstrom the spy, the americans, the
humans, theyâ€™re here because i wouldnâ€™t sell. i donâ€™t own it, nobody owns it i tell
them, you donâ€™t have to kill me. rabbitâ€™s choices: freeze, take the chance they wonâ€™t
see you; then bolt.
i have a good start on them and no shoes. i run silently, dodging branches,
heading for the path to the swamp, the canoe is there, i can easily reach it first. on
the open lake they could cut me off with the motorboat but if i go into
