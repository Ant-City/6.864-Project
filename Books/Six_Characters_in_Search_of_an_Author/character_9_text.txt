prompter [reading as before]. "when the curtain rises, leo gala, dressed in cook's cap and apron is busy beating an egg in a cup. philip, also dresesd as a cook, is beating another egg. guido venanzi is seated and listening."

leading man [to manager]. excuse me, but must i absolutely wear a cook's cap?

the manager [annoyed]. i imagine so. it says so there anyway. [pointing to the "book."]

leading man. but it's ridiculous!

the manager [jumping up in a rage]. ridiculous? ridiculous? is it my fault if france won't send us any snore good comedies, and we are reduced to putting on pirandello's works, where nobody understands anything, and where the author plays the fool with us all?

[to leading man.] "the empty form of reason without the fullness of instinct, which is blind." -- you stand for reason, your wife is instinct. it's a mixing up of the parts, according to which you who act your own part become the puppet of yourself. do you understand?

leading man. i'm hanged if i do.

the manager. neither do i. but let's get on with it. it's sure to be a glorious failure anyway. [confidentially.] but i say, please face three-quarters. otherwise, what with the abstruseness of the dialogue, and

the step-daughter. he was always full of affection and kindness for you. [to the boy, angrily.] it's true, isn't it? tell them! why don't you speak, you little fool?

the mother. leave the poor boy alone. why do you want to make me appear ungrateful, daughter? i don't want to offend your father. i have answered him that i didn't abandon my house and my son through any fault of mine, nor from any wilful passion.

the father. it is true. it was my doing.

leading man [to the company]. what a spectacle!

leading lady. we are the audience this time.

juvenile lead. for once, in a way.

the manager [beginning to get really interested]. let's hear them out. listen!

the son. oh yes, you're going to hear a fine bit now. he will talk to you of the demon of experiment.

the step-daughter. yes, but ask him how his intelligence has helped us.

the father. if we could see all the evil that may spring from good, what should we do? [at this point the leading lady who is biting her lips with rage at seeing the leading man flirting with the step-daughter, comes forward and says to the manager.]

leading lady. excuse me, but are we going to rehearse today?

manager. of course, of course; but let's hear them out.

juvenile lead. this is something quite new.

l'ingénue. most interesting!

leading lady. yes, for the people who like that kind of thing. [casts a glance at leading man.]

the manager. yes, yes. come on! come on! [moves away and then turning to the actors.] be punctual, please! [manager and the six characters cross the stage and go off. the other actors remain, looking at one another in astonishment.]

leading man. is he serious? what the devil does be want to do?

juvenile lead. this is rank madness.

third actor. does he expect to knock up a drama in five minutes?

juvenile lead. like the improvisers!

leading lady. if he thinks i'm going to take part in a joke like this . . .

juvenile lead. i'm out of it anyway.

fourth actor. i should like to know who they are.. [alludes to characters].

the manager [to prompter]. you follow the scenes as we play them, and try and get the points down, at any rate the most important ones. [then addressing the actors.] clear the stage, ladies and gentlemen! come over here [pointing to the left.] and listen attentively.

leading lady. but, excuse me, we . . .

the manager [guessing her thought]. don't worry! you won't have to improvise.

leading man. what have we to do then?

the manager. nothing. for the moment you just watch and listen. everybody will get his part written out afterwards. at present we're going to try the thing as best we can. they're going to act now.

the manager. oh this is grand! you want to come before the public yourselves then?

the father. as we are . . .

the manager. i can assure you it would be a magnificent spectacle!

leading man. what's the use of us here anyway then?

the manager. you're not going to pretend that you can act? it makes me laugh! [the actors laugh.] there, you see, they are laughing at the notion. but, by the way, i must cast the parts. that won't be difficult. they cast themselves.

the manager. now, look here! on the stage, you as yourself, cannot exist. the actor here acts you, and that's an end to it!

the father. i understand. and now i think i see why our author who conceived us as we are, all alive, didn't want to put us on the stage after all. i haven't the least desire to offend your actors. far from it! but when i think that i am to be acted by . . . i don't know by whom . . .

leading lady. a vulgar trick!

step-daughter and madame pace has already begun despite the protest of the actors and the reply of the father. it has begun quietly, naturally, in a manner impossible for the stage. so when the actors, called to attention by the father, turn round and see madame pace, who has placed one hand under the step-daughter's chin to raise her head, they observe her at first with great attention, but hearing her speak in an unintelligible manner their interest begins to wane.]

the manager. well? well?

leading man. what does she say?

leading lady. one can't hear a word.

juvenile lead. louder! louder please!

the step-daughter [leaving madame pace, who smiles a sphinx-like smile, and advancing towards the actors]. louder? louder? what are you talking about? these aren't matters which can be shouted at the top of one's voice. if i have spoken them out loud, it was to shame him and have my revenge.

[the door at rear of stage opens, and the leading man enters with the lively manner of an old gallant. the rendering of the scene by the actors from the very first words is seen to be quite a different thing, though it has not in any way the air of a parody. naturally, the step-daughter and the father, not being able to recognize themselves in the leading lady and the leading man, who deliver their words in different tones and with a different psychology, express, sometimes with smiles, sometimes with gestures, the impression they receive.]

the step-daughter. forgive me, sir, but it's natural enough. this lady [indicating leading lady.] stands there still; but if she is supposed to be me, i can assure you that if i heard anyone say "good afternoon" in that manner and in that tone, i should burst out laughing as i did.

the manager [turning round]. what's the matter?

the step-daughter. nothing, nothing!

the manager [to leading man]. go on!

leading man. you've been here before, eh? well then, there's no need to be so shy, is there? may i take off your hat?

the manager.. why not?

the step-daughter. because he [indicates the son again.] is always shut up alone in his room. and then there's all the part of that poor dazed-looking boy there which takes place indoors.

the manager. maybe! on the other hand, you will understand -- we can't change scenes three or four times in one act.

the leading man. they used to once.

the manager. yes, when the public was up to the level of that child there.

the leading lady. it makes the illusion easier.

the manager. i should say you were mad -- ! [the actors laugh.]

the manager [annoyed]. but we've had all this over once before. do you want to begin again?
