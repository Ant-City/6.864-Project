Equivalence principle - 
The basic tenet of general relativity. The equivalence
principle states that accelerated motion is indistinguishable from
gravity. It generalizes the theory of relativity by showing that
all observers, regardless of their state of motion, can say that
they are at rest, provided they take the presence of a gravitational
field into account.
