[CHARACTER] - 
                 huck's
friend, and the protagonist of [CHARACTER], the
novel to which huckleberry finn is ostensibly the sequel.
in huckleberry finn, tom serves as a foil to huck:
imaginative, dominating, and given to wild plans taken from the
plots of adventure novels, tom is everything that huck is not. tom's
stubborn reliance on the "authorities" of romance novels leads him
to acts of incredible stupidity and startling cruelty. his rigid
adherence to society's conventions aligns tom with the "sivilizing"
forces that huck learns to see through and gradually abandons.
