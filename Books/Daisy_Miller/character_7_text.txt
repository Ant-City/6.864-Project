â€œi am delighted to hear it.â€
â€œiâ€™ve got a lovely dress!â€
â€œi am very sure of that.â€
â€œbut i want to ask a favorâ€”permission to bring a friend.â€
â€œi shall be happy to see any of your friends,â€ said mrs. walker, turning with a smile to mrs. miller.
â€œoh, they are not my friends,â€ answered daisyâ€™s mamma, smiling shyly in her own fashion. â€œi never spoke to them.â€
â€œitâ€™s an intimate friend of mineâ€”mr. giovanelli,â€ said daisy without a tremor in her clear little voice or a shadow on her brilliant little face.
mrs. walker was silent a moment; she gave a rapid glance at winterbourne. â€œi shall be glad to see mr. giovanelli,â€ she then said.
â€œheâ€™s an italian,â€ daisy pursued with the prettiest serenity. â€œheâ€™s a great friend of mine; heâ€™s the handsomest man in the worldâ€”except mr. winterbourne! he knows plenty of italians, but he wants to know some americans. he thinks ever so much of ameri

it was settled that this brilliant personage should be brought to mrs. walkerâ€™s party, and then mrs. miller prepared to take her leave. â€œi guess weâ€™ll go back to the hotel,â€ she said.
â€œyou may go back to the hotel, mother, but iâ€™m going to take a walk,â€ said daisy.
â€œsheâ€™s going to walk with mr. giovanelli,â€ randolph proclaimed.
â€œi am going to the pincio,â€ said daisy, smiling.
â€œalone, my dearâ€”at this hour?â€ mrs. walker asked. the afternoon was drawing to a closeâ€”it was the hour for the throng of carriages and of contemplative pedestrians. â€œi donâ€™t think itâ€™s safe, my dear,â€ said mrs. walker.
â€œneither do i,â€ subjoined mrs. miller. â€œyouâ€™ll get the fever, as sure as you live. remember what dr. davis told you!â€

the company had risen to its feet; daisy, still showing her pretty teeth, bent over and kissed her hostess. â€œmrs. walker, you are too perfect,â€ she said. â€œiâ€™m not going alone; i am going to meet a friend.â€
â€œyour friend wonâ€™t keep you from getting the fever,â€ mrs. miller observed.
â€œis it mr. giovanelli?â€ asked the hostess.
winterbourne was watching the young girl; at this question his attention quickened. she stood there, smiling and smoothing her bonnet ribbons; she glanced at winterbourne. then, while she glanced and smiled, she answered, without a shade of hesitation, â€œmr. giovanelliâ€”the beautiful giovanelli.â€
â€œmy dear young friend,â€ said mrs. walker, taking her hand pleadingly, â€œdonâ€™t walk off to the pincio at this hour to meet a beautiful italian.â€

 found their progress much delayed. this fact was highly agreeable to winterbourne, in spite of his consciousness of his singular situation. the slow-moving, idly gazing roman crowd bestowed much attention upon the extremely pretty young foreign lady who was passing through it upon his arm; and he wondered what on earth had been in daisyâ€™s mind when she proposed to expose herself, unattended, to its appreciation. his own mission, to her sense, apparently, was to consign her to the hands of mr. giovanelli; but winterbourne, at once annoyed and gratified, resolved that he would do no such thing.
â€œwhy havenâ€™t you been to see me?â€ asked daisy. â€œyou canâ€™t get out of that.â€
â€œi have had the honor of telling you that i have only just stepped out of the train.â€
â€œyou must have stayed in the train a good while after it stopped!â€ cried the young girl with her little laugh. â€œi suppose you were asleep. you have had time to go to see mrs. walker.â€
â€œi knew mrs. walkerâ€”â€ winterbour

â€œi certainly shall not help you to find him,â€ winterbourne declared.
â€œthen i shall find him without you,â€ cried miss daisy.
â€œyou certainly wonâ€™t leave me!â€ cried winterbourne.
she burst into her little laugh. â€œare you afraid youâ€™ll get lostâ€”or run over? but thereâ€™s giovanelli, leaning against that tree. heâ€™s staring at the women in the carriages: did you ever see

the young girl looked at him more gravely, but with eyes that were prettier than ever. â€œi have never allowed a gentleman to dictate to me, or to interfere with anything i do.â€
â€œi think you have made a mistake,â€ said winterbourne. â€œyou should sometimes listen to a gentlemanâ€”the right one.â€
daisy began to laugh again. â€œi do nothing but listen to gentlemen!â€ she exclaimed. â€œtell me if mr. giovanelli is the right one?â€
the gentleman with the nosegay in his bosom had now perceived our two friends, and was approaching the young girl with obsequious rapidity. he bowed to winterbourne as well as to the latterâ€™s companion; he had a brilliant smile, an intelligent eye; winterbourne thought him not a bad-looking fellow. but he nevertheless said to daisy, â€œno, heâ€™s not the right one.â€
daisy evidently had a natural talent for performing introductions; she mentioned the name of each of her

companions to the other. she strolled alone with one of them on each side of her; mr. giovanelli, who spoke english very cleverlyâ€”winterbourne afterward learned that he had practiced the idiom upon a great many american heiressesâ€”addressed her a great deal of very polite nonsense; he was extremely urbane, and the young american, who said nothing, reflected upon that profundity of italian cleverness which enables people to appear more gracious in proportion as they are more acutely disappointed. giovanelli, of course, had counted upon something more intimate; he had not bargained for a

party of three. but he kept his temper in a manner which suggested far-stretching intentions. winterbourne flattered himself that he had taken his measure. â€œhe is not a gentleman,â€ said the young american; â€œhe is only a clever imitation of one. he is a music master, or a penny-a-liner, or a third-rate artist. d__n his good looks!â€ mr. giovanelli had certainly a very pretty face; but winterbourne felt a superior indignation at his own lovely fellow countrywomanâ€™s not knowing the difference between a spurious gentleman and a real one. giovanelli chattered and jested and made himself wonderfully agreeable. it was true that, if he was an imitation, the imitation was brilliant. â€œnevertheless,â€ winterbourne said to himself, â€œa nice girl ought to know!â€ and then he came back to the question whether this was, in fact, a nice girl. wo

s â€œlawless passions.â€ that she should seem to wish to get rid of him would help him to think more lightly of her, and to be able to think more lightly of her would make her much less perplexing. but daisy, on this occasion, continued to present herself as an inscrutable combination of audacity and innocence.
she had been walking some quarter of an hour, attended by her two cavaliers, and responding in a tone of very childish gaiety, as it seemed to winterbourne, to the pretty speeches of mr. giovanelli, when a carriage that had detached itself from the revolving train drew up beside the path. at the same moment winterbourne perceived that his friend mrs. walkerâ€”the lady whose house he had lately leftâ€”was seated in the vehicle and was beckoning to him. leaving miss millerâ€™s side, he hastened to obey her summons. mrs. walker was flushed; she wore an excited air. â€œit is really too dreadful,â€ she said. â€œthat girl must not do this sort of thing. she must not walk here with you two men.

â€œi donâ€™t think itâ€™s a very happy thought,â€ said winterbourne; â€œbut you can try.â€
mrs. walker tried. the young man went in pursuit of miss miller, who had simply nodded and smiled at his interlocutor in the carriage and had gone her way with her companion. daisy, on learning that mrs. walker wished to speak to her, retraced her steps with a perfect good grace and with mr. giovanelli at her side. she declared that she was delighted to have a chance to present this gentleman to mrs. walker. she immediately achieved the introduction, and declared that she had never in her life seen anything so lovely as mrs. walkerâ€™s carriage rug.
â€œi am glad you admire it,â€ said this lady, smiling sweetly. â€œwill you get in and let me put it over you?â€
â€œoh, no, thank you,â€ said daisy. â€œi shall admire it much more as i see you driving round with it.â€

â€œyou are old enough to be more reasonable. you are old enough, dear miss miller, to be talked about.â€
daisy looked at mrs. walker, smiling intensely. â€œtalked about? what do you mean?â€
â€œcome into my carriage, and i will tell you.â€
daisy turned her quickened glance again from one of the gentlemen beside her to the other. mr. giovanelli was bowing to and fro, rubbing down his gloves and laughing very agreeably; winterbourne thought it a most unpleasant scene. â€œi donâ€™t think i want to know what you mean,â€ said daisy presently. â€œi donâ€™t think i should like it.â€
winterbourne wished that mrs. walker would tuck in her carriage rug and drive away, but this lady did not enjoy being defied, as she afterward told him. â€œshould you prefer being thought a very reckless girl?â€ she demanded.
â€œgracious!â€ exclaimed daisy.

she looked again at mr. giovanelli, then she turned to winterbourne. there was a little pink flush in her cheek; she was tremendously pretty. â€œdoes mr. winterbourne think,â€ she asked slowly, smiling, throwing back her head, and glancing at him from head to foot, â€œthat, to save my reputation, i ought to get into the carriage?â€
winterbourne colored; for an instant he hesitated greatly. it seemed so strange to hear her speak that way of her â€œreputation.â€ but he himself, in fact, must speak in accordance with gallantry.

winterbourne, as the few indications i have been able to give have made him known to the reader, was that daisy miller should take mrs. walkerâ€™s advice. he looked at her exquisite prettiness, and then he said, very gently, â€œi think you should get into the carriage.â€
daisy gave a violent laugh. â€œi never heard anything so stiff! if this is improper, mrs. walker,â€ she pursued, â€œthen i am all improper, and you must give me up. goodbye; i hope youâ€™ll have a lovely ride!â€ and, with mr. giovanelli, who made a triumphantly obsequious salute, she turned away.
mrs. walker sat looking after her, and there were tears in mrs. walkerâ€™s eyes. â€œget in here, sir,â€ she said to winterbourne, indicating the place beside her. the young man answered that he felt bound to accompany miss miller, whereupon mrs. walker declared that if he refused her this favor she would never speak to him again. she was evidently in earnest. winterbourne overtook daisy and her companion, and, offering the young girl

winterbourne was not in the best possible humor as he took his seat in mrs. walkerâ€™s victoria. â€œthat was not clever of you,â€ he said candidly, while the vehicle mingled again with the throng of carriages.
â€œin such a case,â€ his companion answered, â€œi donâ€™t wish to be clever; i wish to be earnest!â€
â€œwell, your earnestness has only offended her and put her off.â€

oward the parapet. winterbourne had asked the coachman to stop; he now descended from the carriage. his companion looked at him a moment in silence; then, while he raised his hat, she drove majestically away. winterbourne stood there; he had turned his eyes toward daisy and her cavalier. they evidently saw no one; they were too deeply occupied with each other. when they reached the low garden wall, they stood a moment looking off at the great flat-topped pine clusters of the villa borghese; then giovanelli seated himself, familiarly, upon the broad ledge of the wall. the western sun in the opposite sky sent out a brilliant shaft through a couple of cloud bars, whereupon daisyâ€™s companion took her parasol out of her hands and opened it. she came a little nearer, and he held the parasol over her; then, still holding it, he let it rest upon her shoulder, so that both of their heads were hidden from winterbourne. this young man lingered a moment, then he began to walk. but he walkedâ€”not toward th

â€œwell, daisyâ€™s all dressed,â€ said mrs. miller with that accent of the dispassionate, if not of the philosophic, historian with which she always recorded the current incidents of her daughterâ€™s career. â€œshe got dressed on purpose before dinner. but sheâ€™s got a friend of hers there; that gentlemanâ€”the italianâ€”that she wanted to bring. theyâ€™ve got going at the piano; it seems as if they couldnâ€™t leave off. mr. giovanelli sings splendidly. but i guess theyâ€™ll come before very long,â€ concluded mrs. miller hopefully.
â€œiâ€™m sorry she should come in that way,â€ said mrs. walker.
â€œwell, i told her that there was no use in her getting dressed before dinner if she was going to wait three hours,â€ responded daisyâ€™s mamma. â€œi didnâ€™t see the use of her putting on such a dress as that to sit round with mr. giovanelli.â€
â€œthis is most horrible!â€ said mrs. walker, turning away and addressing herself to

daisy came after eleven oâ€™clock; but she was not, on such an occasion, a young lady to wait to be spoken to. she rustled forward in radiant loveliness, smiling and chattering, carrying a large bouquet, and attended by mr. giovanelli. everyone stopped talking and turned and looked at her. she came straight to mrs. walker. â€œiâ€™m afraid you thought i never was coming, so i sent mother off to tell you. i wanted to make mr. giovanelli practice some things before he came; you know he sings beautifully, and i want you to ask him to sing. this is mr. giovanelli; you know i introduced him to you; heâ€™s got the most lovely voice, and he knows the most charming set of songs. i made him go over them this evening on purpose; we had

â€œi think every one knows you!â€ said mrs. walker pregnantly, and she gave a very cursory greeting to mr. giovanelli. this gentleman bore himself gallantly. he smiled and bowed and showed his white teeth; he curled his mustaches and rolled his eyes and performed all the proper functions of a handsome italian at an evening party. he sang very prettily half a dozen songs, though mrs. walker afterward declared that she had been quite unable to find out who asked him. it was apparently not daisy who had given him his orders. daisy sat at a distance from the piano, and though she had publicly, as it were, professe

â€œi am not sorry we canâ€™t dance,â€ winterbourne answered; â€œi donâ€™t dance.â€
â€œof course you donâ€™t dance; youâ€™re too stiff,â€ said miss daisy. â€œi hope you enjoyed your drive with mrs. walker!â€
â€œno. i didnâ€™t enjoy it; i preferred walking with you.â€
â€œwe paired off: that was much better,â€ said daisy. â€œbut did you ever hear anything so cool as mrs. walkerâ€™s wanting me to get into her carriage and drop poor mr. giovanelli, and under the pretext that it was proper? people have different ideas! it would have been most unkind; he had been talking about that walk for ten days.â€
â€œhe should not have talked about it at all,â€ said winterbourne; â€œhe would never have proposed to a young lady of this country to walk about the streets with him.â€

â€œi thought they understood nothing else!â€ exclaimed daisy.

â€œit seems to me much more proper in young unmarried women than in old married ones,â€ daisy declared.
â€œwell,â€ said winterbourne, â€œwhen you deal with natives you must go by the custom of the place. flirting is a purely american custom; it doesnâ€™t exist here. so when you show yourself in public with mr. giovanelli, and without your motherâ€”â€
â€œgracious! poor mother!â€ interposed daisy.
â€œthough you may be flirting, mr. giovanelli is not; he means something else.â€
â€œhe isnâ€™t preaching, at any rate,â€ said daisy with vivacity. â€œand if you want very much to know, we are neither of us flirting; we are too good friends for that: we are very intimate friends.â€
â€œah!â€ rejoined winterbourne, â€œif you are in love with each other, it is another affair.â€
she had allowed him up to this point to

 talk so frankly that he had no expectation of shocking her by this ejaculation; but she immediately got up, blushing visibly, and leaving him to exclaim mentally that little american flirts were the queerest creatures in the world. â€œmr. giovanelli, at least,â€ she said, giving her interlocutor a single glance, â€œnever says such very disagreeable things to me.â€
winterbourne was bewildered; he stood, staring. mr. giovanelli had finished singing. he left the piano and came over to daisy. â€œwonâ€™t you come into the other room and have some tea?â€ he asked, bending before her with his ornamental smile.
daisy turned to winterbourne, beginning to smile again. he was still more perplexed, for this inconsequent smile made nothing clear, though it seemed to prove, indeed, that she had a sweetness and softness that reverted instinctively to the pardon of offenses. â€œit has never occurred to mr. winterbourne to offer me

 any tea,â€ she said with her little tormenting manner.
â€œi have offered you advice,â€ winterbourne rejoined.
â€œi prefer weak tea!â€ cried daisy, and she went off with the brilliant giovanelli. she sat with him in the adjoining room, in the embrasure of the window, for the rest of the evening. there was an interesting performance at the piano, but neither of these young people gave heed to it. when daisy came to take leave of mrs. walker, this lady conscientiously repaired the weakness of which she had been guilty at the moment of the young girlâ€™s arrival. she turned her back straight upon miss miller and left her to depart with what grace she might. winterbourne was standing near

â€œthat was very cruel,â€ he said to mrs. walker.
â€œshe never enters my drawing room again!â€ replied his hostess.
since winterbourne was not to meet her in mrs. walkerâ€™s drawing room, he went as often as possible to mrs. millerâ€™s hotel. the ladies were rarely at home, but when he found them, the devoted giovanelli was always present. very often the brilliant little roman was in the drawing room with daisy alone, mrs. miller being apparently constantly of the opinion that discretion is the better part of surveillance. winterbourne noted, at first with surprise, that daisy on these occasions was never embarrassed or annoyed by his own entrance; but he very presently began to feel that she had no more surprises for him; the unexpected in her behavior was the only thing to expect. she showed no displeasure a

t her tete-a-tete with giovanelli being interrupted; she could chatter as freshly and freely with two gentlemen as with one; there was always, in her conversation, the same odd mixture of audacity and puerility. winterbourne remarked to himself that if she was seriously interested in giovanelli, it was very singular that she should not take more trouble to preserve the sanctity of their interviews; and he liked her the more for her innocent-looking indifference and her apparently inexhaustible good humor. he could hardly have said why, but she seemed to him a girl who would never be jealous. at the risk of exciting a somewhat derisive smile on the readerâ€™s part, i may affirm that with regard to the women who had hitherto interested him, it very often seemed to winterbourne among the

 possibilities that, given certain contingencies, he should be afraidâ€”literally afraidâ€”of these ladies; he had a pleasant sense that he should never be afraid of daisy miller. it must be added that this sentiment was not altogether flattering to daisy; it was part of his conviction, or rather of his apprehension, that she would prove a very light young person.
but she was evidently very much interested in giovanelli. she looked at him whenever he spoke; she was perpetually telling him to do this and to do that; she was constantly â€œchaffingâ€ and abusing him. she appeared completely to have forgotten that winterbourne had said anything to displease her at mrs. walkerâ€™s little party. one sunday afternoon, having gone to st. peterâ€™s with his aunt, winterbourne perceived daisy strolling about the great church in company with the inevitable giovanelli. presently he pointed out the young girl and her cava

â€œi donâ€™t believe she thinks of marrying him,â€ said winterbourne, â€œand i donâ€™t believe he hopes to marry her.â€

â€œi think that is more than giovanelli expects,â€ said winterbourne.
â€œwho is giovanelli?â€
â€œthe little italian. i have asked questions about him and learned something. he is apparently a perfectly respectable little man. i believe he is, in a small way, a cavaliere avvocato. but he doesnâ€™t move in what are called the first circles. i think it is really not absolutely impossible that the courier introduced him. he is evidently immensely charmed with miss miller. if she thinks him the finest gentleman in the world, he, on his

side, has never found himself in personal contact with such splendor, such opulence, such expensiveness as this young ladyâ€™s. and then she must seem to him wonderfully pretty and interesting. i rather doubt that he dreams of marrying her. that must appear to him too impossible a piece of luck. he has nothing but his handsome face to offer, and there is a substantial mr. miller in that mysterious land of dollars. giovanelli knows that he hasnâ€™t a title to offer. if he were only a count or a marchese! he must wonder at his luck, at the way they have taken him up.â€
â€œhe accounts for it by his handsome face and thinks miss miller a young lady qui se passe ses fantaisies!â€ said mrs. costello.
â€œit is very true,â€ winterbourne pursued, â€œthat daisy and her mamma have not yet risen to that stage ofâ€”what shall i call it?â€”of culture at which the idea of catching a count or a marchese begins. i believe that t

â€œso she is!â€ answered winterbourne; and having assured himself that his informant had seen daisy and her companion but five minutes before, he jumped into a cab and went to call on mrs. miller. she was at home; but she apologized to him for receiving him in daisyâ€™s absence.
â€œsheâ€™s gone out somewhere with mr. giovanelli,â€ said mrs. miller. â€œsheâ€™s always going round with mr. giovanelli.â€
â€œi have noticed that they are very intimate,â€ winterbourne observed.
â€œoh, it seems as if they couldnâ€™t live without each other!â€ said mrs. miller. â€œwell, heâ€™s a real gentleman, anyhow. i keep telling daisy sheâ€™s engaged!â€
â€œand what does daisy say?â€
â€œoh, she says she isnâ€™t engaged. but she might as well be!â€ this impartial parent resumed; â€œshe goes on as if she was. but iâ€™ve made mr. giova

eâ€™s self to a belief in daisyâ€™s â€œinnocenceâ€ came to seem to winterbourne more and more a matter of fine-spun gallantry. as i have already had occasion to relate, he was angry at finding himself reduced to chopping logic about this young lady; he was vexed at his want of instinctive certitude as to how far her eccentricities were generic, national, and how far they were personal. from either view of them he had somehow missed her, and now it was too late. she was â€œcarried awayâ€ by mr. giovanelli.
a few days after his brief interview with her mother, he encountered her in that beautiful abode of flowering desolation known as the palace of the caesars. the early roman spring had filled the air with bloom and perfume, and the rugged surface of the palatine was muffled with tender verdure. daisy was strolling along the top of one of those great mounds of ruin that are embanked with mossy marble and paved with monumental inscriptions. it seemed to him that rome had never been so lovely as j

â€œwell,â€ said daisy, â€œi should think you would be lonesome!â€
â€œlonesome?â€ asked winterbourne.
â€œyou are always going round by yourself. canâ€™t you get anyone to walk with you?â€
â€œi am not so fortunate,â€ said winterbourne, â€œas your companion.â€
giovanelli, from the first, had treated winterbourne with distinguished politeness. he listened with a deferential air to his remarks; he laughed punctiliously at his pleasantries; he s

eemed disposed to testify to his belief that winterbourne was a superior young man. he carried himself in no degree like a jealous wooer; he had obviously a great deal of tact; he had no objection to your expecting a little humility of him. it even seemed to winterbourne at times that giovanelli would find a certain mental relief in being able to have a private understanding with himâ€”to say to him, as an intelligent man, that, bless you, he knew how extraordinary was this young lady, and didnâ€™t flatter himself with delusiveâ€”or at least too delusiveâ€”hopes of matrimony and dollars. on this occasion he strolled away from his companion to pluck a sprig of almond blossom, which he carefully arranged in his buttonhole.
â€œi know why you say that,â€ said daisy, watching giovanelli. â

â€œyou will find i am not so stiff as several others,â€ said winterbourne, smiling.
â€œhow shall i find it?â€
â€œby going to see the others.â€
â€œwhat will they do to me?â€
â€œthey will give you the cold shoulder. do you know what that means?â€
daisy was looking at him intently; she began to color. â€œdo you mean as mrs. walker did the other night?â€
â€œexactly!â€ said winterbourne.
she looked away at giovanelli, who was decorating himself with his almond blossom. then looking back at winterbourne, â€œi shouldnâ€™t think you would let people be so unkind!â€ she said.
â€œhow can i help it?â€ he asked.
â€œi should think you would say something.â€
â€œi do say something;â€ and he paused a moment. â€œi say that your mother tells me that she believes you are engaged.â€
â€œwell, she does,â€ said daisy very simply.
winterbourne began to laugh. â€œand does randolph believe it?â€ he asked.

presently the sound of the womanâ€™s voice came to him distinctly in the warm night air. â€œwell, he looks at us as one of the old lions or tigers may have looked at the christian martyrs!â€ these were the words he heard, in the familiar accent of miss daisy miller.
â€œlet us hope he is not very hungry,â€ responded the ingenious giovanelli. â€œhe will have to take me first; you will serve for dessert!â€
winterbourne stopped, with a sort of horror, and, it must be added, with a sort of relief. it was as if a sudden illumination had been flashed upon the ambiguity of daisyâ€™s behavior, and the riddle had become easy to read. she was a young lady whom a gentleman need no longer be at pains to respect. he stood there, looking at herâ€”looking at her companion and not reflecting that though he saw them vaguely, he himself must have

as doing her injustice, but from a sense of the danger of appearing unbecomingly exhilarated by this sudden revulsion from cautious criticism. he turned away toward the entrance of the place, but, as he did so, he heard daisy speak again.
â€œwhy, it was mr. winterbourne! he saw me, and he cuts me!â€
what a clever little reprobate she was, and how smartly she played at injured innocence! but he wouldnâ€™t cut her. winterbourne came forward again and went toward the great cross. daisy had got up; giovanelli lifted his hat. winterbourne had now begun to think simply of the craziness, from a sanitary point of view, of a delicate young girl lounging away the evening in this nest of malaria. what if she were a clever little reprobate? that was no reason for her dying of the perniciosa. â€œhow long have you been here?â€ he asked almost brutally.
daisy, lovely in the flattering moonlight, looked at him a moment. thenâ€”â€œall the evening,â€ she answered, gently. * * * â€œi never saw anything so pretty

â€œi am afraid,â€ said winterbourne, â€œthat you will not think roman fever very pretty. this is the way people catch it. i wonder,â€ he added, turning to giovanelli, â€œthat you, a native roman, should countenance such a terrible indiscretion.â€
â€œah,â€ said the handsome native, â€œfor myself i am not afraid.â€
â€œneither am iâ€”for you! i am speaking for this young lady.â€
giovanelli lifted his well-shaped eyebrows and showed his brilliant teeth. but he took winterbourneâ€™s rebuke with docility. â€œi told the signorina it was a grave indiscretion, but when was the signorina ever prudent?â€
â€œi never was sick, and i donâ€™t mean to be!â€ the signo

rina declared. â€œi donâ€™t look like much, but iâ€™m healthy! i was bound to see the colosseum by moonlight; i shouldnâ€™t have wanted to go home without that; and we have had the most beautiful time, havenâ€™t we, mr. giovanelli? if there has been any danger, eugenio can give me some pills. he has got some splendid pills.â€
â€œi should advise you,â€ said winterbourne, â€œto drive home as fast as possible and take one!â€
â€œwhat you say is very wise,â€ giovanelli rejoined. â€œi will go and make sure the carriage is at hand.â€ and he went forward rapidly.
daisy followed with winterbourne. he kept looking at her; she seemed not in the least embarrassed. winterbourne said nothing; daisy chattered about the beauty of the place. â€œwell, i have seen the colosseum by moonlight!â€ she exclaimed. â€œthatâ€™s one good thing.â€ then, noticing winterbourneâ€™s silence, she asked him why he didnâ€™t speak. he made no answer; he only began to laugh. they passed u

nder one of the dark archways; giovanelli was in front with the carriage. here daisy stopped a moment, looking at the young american. â€œdid you believe i was engaged, the other day?â€ she asked.
â€œit doesnâ€™t matter what i believed the other day,â€ said winterbourne, still laughing.
â€œwell, what do you believe now?â€
â€œi believe that it makes very little difference whether you are engaged or not!â€
he felt the young girlâ€™s pretty eyes fixed upon him through the thick gloom of the archway; she was apparently going to answer.

but giovanelli hurried her forward. â€œquick! quick!â€ he said; â€œif we get in by midnight we are quite safe.â€
daisy took her seat in the carriage, and the fortunate italian placed himself beside her. â€œdonâ€™t forget eugenioâ€™s pills!â€ said winterbourne as he lifted his hat.
â€œi donâ€™t care,â€ said daisy in a little strange tone, â€œwhether i have roman fever or not!â€ upon this the cab driver cracked his whip, and they rolled away over the desultory patches of the antique pavement.
winterbourne,

ppeared, a most efficient and judicious nurse. she talked a good deal about dr. davis, but winterbourne paid her the compliment of saying to himself that she was not, after all, such a monstrous goose. â€œdaisy spoke of you the other day,â€ she said to him. â€œhalf the time she doesnâ€™t know what sheâ€™s saying, but that time i think she did. she gave me a message she told me to tell you. she told me to tell you that she never was engaged to that handsome italian. i am sure i am very glad; mr. giovanelli hasnâ€™t been near us since she was taken ill. i thought he was so much of a gentleman; but i donâ€™t call that very polite! a lady told me that he was afraid i was angry with him for taking daisy round at night. well, so i am, but i suppose he knows iâ€™m a lady. i would scorn to scold him. anyway, she says sheâ€™s not engaged. i donâ€™t know why she wanted you to know, but she said to me three times, â€˜mind you tell mr. winterbourne.â€™ and then she told me to ask if you remembered the time

sure iâ€™m glad to know it.â€
but, as winterbourne had said, it mattered very little. a week after this, the poor girl died; it had been a terrible case of the fever. daisyâ€™s grave was in the little protestant cemetery, in an angle of the wall of imperial rome, beneath the cypresses and the thick spring flowers. winterbourne stood there beside it, with a number of other mourners, a number larger than the scandal excited by the young ladyâ€™s career would have led you to expect. near him stood giovanelli, who came nearer still before winterbourne turned away. giovanelli was very pale: on this occasion he had no flower in his buttonhole; he seemed to wish to say something. at last he said, â€œshe was the most beautiful young lady i ever saw, and the most amiable;â€ and then he added in a moment, â€œand she was the most innocent.â€
winterbourne looked at him and presently repeated his words, â€œand the most innocent?â€
â€œthe most innocent!â€
winterbourne felt sore and angry. â€œwhy the devil

,â€ he asked, â€œdid you take her to that fatal place?â€
mr. giovanelliâ€™s urbanity was apparently imperturbable. he looked on the ground a moment, and then he said, â€œfor myself i had no fear; and she wanted to go.â€
â€œthat was no reason!â€ winterbourne declared.
the subtle roman again dropped his eyes. â€œif she had lived, i should have got nothing. she would never have married me, i am sure.â€
â€œshe would never have married you?â€
â€œfor a moment i hoped so. but no. i am sure.â€
winterbourne listened to him: he stood staring at the raw protuberance amon

g the april daisies. when he turned away again, mr. giovanelli, with his light, slow step, had retired.
winterbourne almost immediately left rome; but the following summer he again met his aunt, mrs. costello at vevey. mrs. costello was fond of vevey. in the interval winterbourne had often thought of daisy miller and her mystifying manners. one day he spoke of her to his auntâ€”said it was on his conscience that he had done her injustice.
â€œi am sure i donâ€™t know,â€ said mrs. costello. â€œhow did your injustice affect her?â€
â€œshe sent me a message b
