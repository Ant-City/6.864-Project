nued;
    where valiant talbot, above human thought,
    enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
    hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;
    here, there, and everywhere, enrag'd he slew
    the french exclaim'd the devil was in arms;
    all the whole army stood agaz'd on him.
    his soldiers, spying his undaunted spirit,
    'a talbot! a talbot!' cried out amain,
    and rush'd into the bowels of the battle.
    here had the conquest fully been seal'd up
    if sir john fastolfe had not play'd the coward.
    he, being in the vaward plac'd behind
    with purpose to relieve and follow them-
    cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke;
    hence grew the general wreck and massacre.
    enclosed were they with their enemies.
    a base walloon, to win the dauphin's grace,
    thrust talbot with a spear into the back;
    whom all france, with their chief assembled strength,
    durst not presume to look once in the face.
