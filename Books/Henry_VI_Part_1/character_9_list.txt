Mortimer - 
      Richard Plantagenet's uncle, Mortimer has been imprisoned in the Tower of London for years because of his claim to the English throne; Henry's allies have wanted him out of the way. Mortimer tells Plantagenet about this claim but urges him to forget about it because the ruling party is immovable.
