roceedings most
attentively; but scarcely had they halted when my servitor, who had left
my side for an instant, touched my arm and proposed our returning to
marheyo’s house. to this i objected; but, to my surprise, kory-kory
reiterated his request, and with an unusual vehemence of manner. still,
however, i refused to comply, and was retreating before him, as in his
importunity he pressed upon me, when i felt a heavy hand laid upon my
shoulder, and turning round, encountered the bulky form of mow-mow, a
one-eyed chief, who had just detached himself from the crowd below, and
had mounted the rear of the pi-pi upon which we stood. his cheek had
been pierced by the point of a spear, and the wound imparted a still
more frightful expression to his hideously tattooed face, already
deformed by the loss of an eye. the warrior, without uttering a
syllable, pointed fiercely in the direction of marheyo’s house, while
kory-kory, at the same time presenting his back, desired me to mount.

i declined th

at the various houses where we stopped, i found many of the inhabitants
reclining at their ease, or pursuing some light occupation, as if
nothing unusual were going forward; but amongst them all i did not
perceive a single chief or warrior. when i asked several of the people
why they were not at the ‘hoolah hoolah’ (the feast), their uniformly
answered the question in a manner which implied that it was not intended
for them, but for mehevi, narmonee, mow-mow, kolor, womonoo, kalow,
running over, in their desire to make me comprehend their meaning, the
names of all the principal chiefs.

everything, in short, strengthened my suspicions with regard to the
nature of the festival they were now celebrating; and which amounted
almost to a certainty. while in nukuheva i had frequently been informed
that the whole tribe were never present at these cannibal banquets, but
the chiefs and priests only; and everything i now observed agreed with
the account.

to come as vividly before my eyes as if they were actually present, and
i still feel the soothing quiet pleasure which i then had in watching
hour after hour their topmost boughs waving gracefully in the breeze.



chapter thirty-four

the escape

nearly three weeks had elapsed since the second visit of marnoo, and it
must have been more than four months since i entered the valley, when
one day about noon, and whilst everything was in profound silence,
mow-mow, the one-eyed chief, suddenly appeared at the door, and leaning
towards me as i lay directly facing him, said in a low tone, ‘toby pemi
ena’ (toby has arrived here). gracious heaven! what a tumult of emotions
rushed upon me at this startling intelligence! insensible to the pain
that had before distracted me, i leaped to my feet, and called wildly
to kory-kory who was reposing by my side. the startled islanders sprang
from their mats; the news was quickly communicated to them; and the
next m

oment i was making my way to the ti on the back of kory-kory; and
surrounded by the excited savages.

all that i could comprehend of the particulars which mow-mow rehearsed
to his audience as we proceeded, was that my long-lost companion had
arrived in a boat which had just entered the bay. these tidings made
me most anxious to be carried at once to the sea, lest some untoward
circumstance should prevent our meeting; but to this they would not
consent, and continued their course towards the royal abode. as we
approached it, mehevi and several chiefs showed themselves from the
piazza, and called upon us loudly to come to them.

as soon as we had approache

, that i might give a joyful welcome to
my long-lost comrade; but now that it was known he had not arrived they
would at once oblige me to turn back.

my anticipations were but too correct. in spite of the resistance i
made, they carried me into a house which was near the spot, and left me
upon the mats. shortly afterwards several of those who had accompanied
me from the ti, detaching themselves from the others, proceeded in
the direction of the sea. those who remained--among whom were marheyo,
mow-mow, kory-kory, and tinor--gathered about the dwelling, and appeared
to be awaiting their return.

this convinced me that strangers--perhaps some of my own countrymen--had
for some cause or other entered the bay. distracted at the idea of their
vicinity, and reckless of the pain which i suffered, i heeded not the
assurances of the islanders, that there were no boats at the beach, but
starting to my feet endeavoured to gain the door. instantly the passage
was blocked up by several men, who commanded

 me to resume my seat. the
fierce looks of the irritated savages admonished me that i could gain
nothing by force, and that it was by entreaty alone that i could hope to
compass my object.

guided by this consideration, i turned to mow-mow, the only chief
present whom i had been much in the habit of seeing, and carefully
concealing, my real design, tried to make him comprehend that i still
believed toby to have arrived on the shore, and besought him to allow me
to go forward to welcome him.

to all his repeated assertions, that my companion had not been seen,
i pretended to turn a deaf ear, while i urged my solicitations with an
eloquence of gesture which the one-eyed chief appeared unable to resist.
he seemed indeed to regard me

ho at once retreated from the door,
and i immediately passed out of the house.

here i looked earnestly round for kory-kory; but that hitherto faithful
servitor was nowhere to be seen. unwilling to linger even for a single
instant when every moment might be so important, i motioned to a
muscular fellow near me to take me upon his back; to my surprise he
angrily refused. i turned to another, but with a like result. a third
attempt was as unsuccessful, and i immediately perceived what had
induced mow-mow to grant my request, and why the other natives conducted
themselves in so strange a manner. it was evident that the chief had
only given me liberty to continue my progress towards the sea, because
he supposed that i was deprived of the means of reaching it.

convinced by this of their determination to retain me a captive, i
became desperate; and almost insensible to the pain which i suffered,
i seized a spear which was leaning against the projecting eaves of the
house, and supporting myself wit

pon me, and more than one javelin was threateningly
pointed at me. still i perceived clearly that many of those least
friendly towards me looked irresolute and anxious. i was still some
thirty yards from karakoee when my farther progress was prevented by the
natives, who compelled me to sit down upon the ground, while they still
retained their hold upon my arms. the din and tumult now became tenfold,
and i perceived that several of the priests were on the spot, all of
whom were evidently urging mow-mow and the other chiefs to prevent my
departure; and the detestable word ‘roo-ne! roo-ne!’ which i had heard
repeated a thousand times during the day, was now shouted out on every
side of me. still i saw that the kanaka continued his exertions in my
favour--that he was boldly debating the matter with the savages, and was
striving to entice them by displaying his cloth and powder, and snapping
the lock of his musket. but all he said or did appeared only to augment
the clamours of those around h

oung ladies, all of whom
were vastly willing to take them. this distribution did not occupy ten
seconds, and before it was over the boat was under full way; the kanaka
all the while exclaiming loudly against what he considered a useless
throwing away of valuable property.

although it was clear that my movements had been noticed by several of
the natives, still they had not suspended the conflict in which they
were engaged, and it was not until the boat was above fifty yards from
the shore that mow-mow and some six or seven other warriors rushed into
the sea and hurled their javelins at us. some of the weapons passed
quite as close to us as was desirable, but no one was wounded, and the
men pulled away gallantly. but although soon out of the reach of the
spears, our progress was extremely slow; it blew strong upon the shore,
and the tide was against us; and i saw karakoee, who was steering the
boat, give many a look towards a jutting point of the bay round which we
had to pass.

he headland, the savages were spread right
across our course. our rowers got out their knives and held them ready
between their teeth, and i seized the boat-hook. we were all aware that
if they succeeded in intercepting us they would practise upon us the
manoeuvre which has proved so fatal to many a boat’s crew in these seas.
they would grapple the oars, and seizing hold of the gunwhale, capsize
the boat, and then we should be entirely at their mercy.

after a few breathless moments discerned mow-mow. the athletic islander,
with his tomahawk between his teeth, was dashing the water before him
till it foamed again. he was the nearest to us, and in another instant
he would have seized one of the oars. even at the moment i felt horror
at the act i was about to commit; but it was no time for pity or
compunction, and with a true aim, and exerting all my strength, i dashed
the boat-hook at him. it struck him just below the throat, and forced
him downwards. i had no time to repeat the blow, but i

pathway. so excited were the whole party, that eager as toby was to gain
the beach, it was almost as much as he could do to keep up with them.
making the valley ring with their shouts, they hurried along on a swift
trot, those in advance pausing now and then, and flourishing their
weapons to urge the rest forward.

presently they came to a place where the paths crossed a bend of the
main stream of the valley. here a strange sound came through the grove
beyond, and the islanders halted. it was mow-mow, the one-eyed chief,
who had gone on before; he was striking his heavy lance against the
hollow bough of a tree.

this was a signal of alarm;--for nothing was now heard but shouts
of ‘happar! happar!’--the warriors tilting with their spears and
brandishing them in the air, and the women and boys shouting to each
other, and picking up the stones in the bed of the stream. in a moment
or two mow-mow and two or three other chiefs ran out from the grove, and
the din increased ten fold.

now, tho

e of their warlike cries and gestures, everybody was capering
and laughing, as if it was one of the funniest things in the world to be
awaiting the flight of a score or two of happar javelins from an ambush
in the thickets.

while my comrade was in vain trying to make out the meaning of all this,
a good number of the natives separated themselves from the rest and ran
off into the grove on one side, the others now keeping perfectly still,
as if awaiting the result. after a little while, however, mow-mow, who
stood in advance, motioned them to come on stealthily, which they did,
scarcely rustling a leaf. thus they crept along for ten or fifteen
minutes, every now and then pausing to listen.

toby by no means relished this sort of skulking; if there was going to
be a fight, he wanted it to begin at once. but all in good time,--for
just then, as they went prowling into the thickest of the wood, terrific
howls burst upon them on all sides, and volleys of darts and stones flew
across the path. not

broken canoe by a pile of stones, upon which was a ruinous little shrine
supported by four upright poles, and in front partly screened by a net.
the fishing parties met there, when they came in from the sea, for their
offerings were laid before an image, upon a smooth black stone within.
this spot jimmy said was strictly ‘taboo’, and no one would molest or
come near him while he stayed by its shadow. the old sailor then went
off, and began speaking very earnestly to mow-mow and some other chiefs,
while all the rest formed a circle round the taboo place, looking
intently at toby, and talking to each other without ceasing.

now, notwithstanding what jimmy had just told him, there presently came
up to my comrade an old woman, who seated herself beside him on the
canoe.

‘typee motarkee?’ said she. ‘motarkee nuee,’ said toby.

she then asked him whether he was going to nukuheva; he nodded yes; and
with a plaintive wail and her eyes filling with tears she rose

immy also must have told them. and as they
had done before, when my comrade, to oblige me, started on his perilous
journey to nukuheva, they looked upon me, in his absence, as one of two
inseparable friends who was a sure guaranty for the other’s return.
this is only my own supposition, however, for as to all their strange
conduct, it is still a mystery.

‘you see what sort of a taboo man i am,’ said the sailor, after for some
time silently following the path which led up the mountain. ‘mow-mow
made me a present of this pig here, and the man who carries it will
go right through happar, and down into nukuheva with us. so long as he
stays by me he is safe, and just so it will be with you, and tomorrow
with tommo. cheer up, then, and rely upon me, you will see him in the
morning.’

the ascent of the mountain was not very difficult, owing to its being
near to the sea, where the island ridges are comparatively low; the
path, too, was a fine one, so that in a short time all three were
