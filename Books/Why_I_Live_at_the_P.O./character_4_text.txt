why i live at the p.o.


i was getting along fine with mama, papa-daddy and uncle rondo until my sister stella-rondo just separated from her husband and came back home again. mr. whitaker! of course i went with mr. whitaker first, when he first appeared here in china grove, taking "pose yourself" photos, and stella-rondo broke us up. told him i was one-sided. bigger on one side than the other, which is a deliberate, calculated falsehood: i'm the same. stella-rondo is exactly twelve months to the day younger than i am and for that reason she's spoiled.
   she's alwa

ys had anything in the world she wanted and then she'd throw it away. papa-daddy gave her this gorgeous add-a-pearl necklace when she was eight years old and she threw it away playing baseball when she was nine, with only two pearls.
   so as soon as she got married and moved away from home the first thing she did was separate! from mr. whitaker! this photographer with the popeyes she said she trusted. came home from one of those towns up in illinois and to our complete surprise brought this child of two.
   mama said she like to made her drop dead for a second. "here you h

 this hat, i wish you could see it. she says, "why, mama, shirley-t.'s adopted, i can prove it."
   "how?" says mama, but all i says was, "h'm!" there i was over the hot stove, trying to stretch two chickens over five people and a completely unexpected child into the bargain, without one moment's notice.
   "what do you mean  -  'h'm!'?" says stella-rondo, and mama says, "i heard that, sister."
   i said that oh, i didn't mean a thing, only that whoever shirley-t. was, she was the spit-image of papa-daddy if he'd cut off his beard, which of course he'd never do in the world. papa-daddy's mama's papa and sulks.
   stella-rondo got furious! she said, "sister, i don't need to tell you you got a lot of nerve and always did have and i'll thank you to make no future reference to my adopted child whatsoever."
   "very well," i said. "very well, very well. of course i noticed at once she looks like mr. whitaker's side too. that frown. she looks like a cross between mr. whitaker and papa-daddy."
   "well

, all i can say is she isn't."
   "she looks exactly like shirley temple to me," says mama, but shirley-t. just ran away from her.
   so the first thing stella-rondo did at the table was turn papa-daddy against me.
   "papa-daddy," she says. he was trying to cut up his meat. "papa-daddy!" i was taken completely by surprise. papa-daddy is about a million years old and's got this long-long beard. "papa-daddy, sister says she fails to understand why you don't cut off your beard."
   so papa-daddy l-a-y-s down his knife and fork! he's real rich. mama says he is, he says he isn't. so he says, "have i heard correctly? you don't understand why i don't cut off my beard?"
   "why," i says, "papa-daddy, of course i understand, i did not say any such of a thing, the idea!"
   he says, "hussy!"
   i says, "papa-daddy, you know i wouldn't any more want you to cut off your beard than the man in the moon. it was the farthest thing from my mind! stella-rondo sat there and made that up while she was

eating breast of chicken."
   but he says, "so the postmistress fails to understand why i don't cut off my beard. which job i got you through my influence with the government. 'bird's nest'  -  is that what you call it?"
   not that it isn't the next to smallest p.o. in the entire state of mississippi.
   i says, "oh, papa-daddy," i says, "i didn't say any such of a thing, i never dreamed it was a bird's nest, i have always been grateful though this is the next to smallest p.o. in the state of mississippi, and i do not enjoy being referred to as a hussy by my own grandfather."
   but stella-rondo says, "yes, you did say it too. anybody in the world could of heard you, that had ears."
   "stop right there," says mama, looking at me.
   so i pulled my napkin straight back through the napkin ring and left the table.

 soon as i was out of the room mama says, "call her back, or she'll starve to death," but papa-daddy says, "this is the beard i started growing on the coast when i was fifteen years old.'' he would of gone on till nightfall if shirley-t. hadn't lost the milky way she ate in cairo.
   so papa-daddy says, "i am going out and lie in the hammock, and you can all sit here and remember my words: i'll never cut off my beard as long as i live, even one inch, and i don't appreciate it in you at all." passed right by me in the hall and went straight out and got in the hammock.
   it would be a holiday. it wasn't five minutes before uncle rondo suddenly appeared in the hall in one of stella-rondo's flesh-colored kimonos, all cut on the bias, like something mr. whitaker probably thought was gorgeous

   "uncle rondo!" i says. "i didn't know who that was! where are you going?"
   "sister," he says, "get out of my way, i'm poisoned."
   "if you're poisoned stay away from papa-daddy," i says. "keep out of the hammock. papa-daddy will certainly beat you on the head if you come within forty miles of him. he thinks i deliberately said he ought to cut off his beard after he got me the p.o., and i've told him and told him and told him, and he acts like he just don't hear me. papa-daddy must of gone stone deaf.'
   "he picked a fine day to do it then," says uncle rondo, and before you could say "jack robinson" flew out in the yard.
   what he'd really done, he'd drunk another bottle of that prescription. he does it every single fourth of july as sure as shooting, and it's horribly expensive. then he falls over in the hammock and snores. so he insisted on zigzagging right on out to the hammock, looking like a half-wit.
   papa-daddy woke up with this horrible yell and right the

t the mail put up at the p.o., much less read it all, and he said if uncle rondo could only fathom the lengths he had gone to to get me that job! and he said on the other hand he thought stella-rondo had a brilliant mind and deserved credit for getting out of town. all the time he was just lying there swinging as pretty as you please and looping out his beard, and poor uncle rondo was pleading  with him to slow down the hammock, it was making him as dizzy as a witch to watch it. but that's what papa-daddy likes about a hammock. so uncle rondo was too dizzy to get turned against me for the time being. he's mama's only brother and is a good case of a one-track mind. ask anybody. a certified pharmacist.
   just then i heard stella-rondo raising the upstairs window. while she was married she got this peculiar idea that it's cooler with the windows shut and locked. so she has to raise the window before she can make a soul hear her outdoors.
   so she raises the window and says, "oh!" you would have t

hought she was mortally wounded.
   uncle rondo and papa-daddy didn't even look up, but kept right on with what they were doing. i had to laugh.
   i flew up the stairs and threw the door open! i says, "what in the wide world's the matter, stella-rondo? you mortally wounded?"
   "no," she says, "i am not mortally wounded but i wish you would do me the favor of looking out that window there and telling me what you see."
   so i shade my eyes and look out the window.
   "i see the front yard," i says.
   "don't you see any human beings?'' she says.
   "i see

 uncle rondo trying to run papa-daddy out of the hammock," i says. "nothing more. naturally, it's so suffocating-hot in the house, with all the windows shut and locked, everybody who cares to stay in their right mind will have to go out and get in the hammock before the fourth of july is over."
   "don't you notice anything different about uncle rondo?" asks stella-rondo.
   "why, no, except he's got on some terrible-looking flesh-colored contraption i wouldn't be found dead in, is all i can see," i says.
   "never mind, you won't

 run upstairs this instant and apologize to stella-rondo and shirley-t."
   "apologize for what?" i says. "i merely wondered if the child was normal, that's all. now that she's proved she is, why, i have nothing further to say."
   but mama just turned on her heel and flew out, furious. she ran right upstairs and hugged the baby. she believed it was adopted. stella-rondo hadn't done a thing but turn her against me from upstairs while i stood there helpless over the hot stove. so that made mama, papa-daddy and the baby all on stella-rondo's side.
   next, uncle rondo.
   i must say that uncle rondo has been marvelous to me at various times in the past and i was completely unprepared to be made to jump out of my skin, the way it turned out. once stella-rondo did something perfectly horrible to him  -  broke a chain letter from flanders field  -  and he took the radio back he had given her and gave it to me. stella-rondo was furious! for six months we all had to call her stella instead of stella-ro

at all i have pride.
   so i just decided i'd go straight down to the p.o. there's plenty of room there in the back, i says to myself.
   well! i made no bones about letting the family catch on to what i was up to. i didn't try to conceal it.
   the first thing they knew, i marched in where they were all playing old maid and pulled the electric oscillating fan out by the plug, and everything got real hot. next i snatched the pillow i'd done the needlepoint on right off the davenport from behind papa-daddy. he went ''ugh!" i beat stella-rondo up the stairs and finally found my charm bracelet in her bureau drawer under a picture of nelson eddy.
   "so that's the way the land lies," says uncle rondo. there he was, piecing on the ham. "well, sister, i'll be glad to donate my army cot if you got any place to set it up, providing you'll leave right this minute and let me get some peace." uncle rondo was in france.
   "thank you kindly for the cot and 'peace' is hardly the word i would select if i had

ck, and this child is far too big to be hers," and she says, "now, why don't you all just sit down and play casino?"
   then shirley-t. sticks out her tongue at me in this perfectly horrible way. she has no more manners than the man in the moon. i told her she was going to cross her eyes like that some day and they'd stick.
   "it's too late to stop me now," i says. "you should have tried that yesterday. i'm going to the p.o. and the only way you can possibly see me is to visit me there."
   so papa-daddy says, "you'll never catch me setting foot in that post office, even if i should take a notion into my head to write a letter some place." he says, "i won't have you reachin' out of that little old window with a pair of shears and cuttin' off any beard of mine. i'm too smart for you!"
   "we all are," says stella-rondo.
   but i said, "if you're so smart, where's mr. whitaker?"
   so then uncle rondo says, "i'll thank you from now on to stop reading all the orders i get on postcards and telling

like. butter-bean vines planted all along the front where the strings are.
   of course, there's not much mail. my family are naturally the main people in china grove, and if they prefer to vanish from the face of the earth, for all the mail they get or the mail they write, why, i'm not going to open my mouth. some of the folks here in town are taking up for me and some turned against me. i know which is which. there are always people who will quit buying stamps just to get on the right side of papa-daddy.
   but here i am, and here i'll stay. i want the world to know i'm happy.
   and if stella-rondo should come to me this minute, on bended knees, and attempt  to explain the incidents of her life with mr. whitaker, i'd simply put my fingers in both my ears and refuse to listen.
