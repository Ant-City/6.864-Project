 he had estimated the time requisite for the
‘affair.’

“i went to work the next day, turning, so to speak, my back on that
station. in that way only it seemed to me i could keep my hold on the
redeeming facts of life. still, one must look about sometimes; and then
i saw this station, these men strolling aimlessly about in the sunshine
of the yard. i asked myself sometimes what it all meant. they wandered
here and there with their absurd long staves in their hands, like a lot
of faithless pilgrims bewitched inside a rotten fence. the word ‘ivory’
rang in the air, was whispered, was sighed. you would think they were
praying to it. a taint of imbecile rapacity blew through it all, like a
whiff from some corpse. by jove! i’ve never seen anything so unreal in
my life. and outside, the silent wilderness surrounding this cleared
speck on the earth struck me as something great and invincible, like
evil or truth, waiting patiently for the passing away of this fantastic
invasion.

anyway, it could not be found there and as it was not likely to be sent
from europe, it did not appear clear to me what he was waiting for. an
act of special creation perhaps. however, they were all waiting--all
the sixteen or twenty pilgrims of them--for something; and upon my word
it did not seem an uncongenial occupation, from the way they took it,
though the only thing that ever came to them was disease--as far as i
could see. they beguiled the time by back-biting and intriguing against
each other in a foolish kind of way. there was an air of plotting about
that station, but nothing came of it, of course. it was as unreal as
everything else--as the philanthropic pretence of the whole concern, as
their talk, as their government,

the other followed me. i heard a scathing murmur at my ear, ‘heap
of muffs--go to.’ the pilgrims could be seen in knots gesticulating,
discussing. several had still their staves in their hands. i verily
believe they took these sticks to bed with them. beyond the fence the
forest stood up spectrally in the moonlight, and through that dim stir,
through the faint sounds of that lamentable courtyard, the silence of
the land went home to one’s very heart--its mystery, its greatness, the
amazing reality of its concealed life. the hurt nigger moaned feebly

cold, and suddenly began to talk about a hippopotamus; wondered whether
sleeping on board the steamer (i stuck to my salvage night and day)
i wasn’t disturbed. there was an old hippo that had the bad habit of
getting out on the bank and roaming at night over the station grounds.
the pilgrims used to turn out in a body and empty every rifle they could
lay hands on at him. some even had sat up o’ nights for him. all this
energy was wasted, though. ‘that animal has a charmed life,’ he said;
‘but you can say this only of brutes in this country. no man--you
apprehend me?--no man here bears a charmed life.’ he stood there for
a moment in the moonlight with his delicate hooked nose set a little
askew, and his mica eyes glittering without a wink, then, with a curt

“i was not surprised to see somebody sitting aft, on the deck, with
his legs dangling over the mud. you see i rather chummed with the few
mechanics there were in that station, whom the other pilgrims naturally
despised--on account of their imperfect manners, i suppose. this was the
foreman--a boiler-maker by trade--a good worker. he was a lank, bony,
yellow-faced man, with big intense eyes. his aspect was worried, and his
head was as bald as the palm of my hand; but his hair in falling seemed
to have stuck to his chin, and had prospered in the new locality,
for his beard hung down to his waist. he was a widower with six young

a frightful clatter came out of that hulk, and the virgin forest on
the other bank of the creek sent it back in a thundering roll upon the
sleeping station. it must have made some of the pilgrims sit up in their
hovels. a dark figure obscured the lighted doorway of the manager’s hut,

why not, indeed! i did not know of any reason why we shouldn’t. ‘they’ll

“but they didn’t. instead of rivets there came an invasion, an
infliction, a visitation. it came in sections during the next three
weeks, each section headed by a donkey carrying a white man in new
clothes and tan shoes, bowing from that elevation right and left to the
impressed pilgrims. a quarrelsome band of footsore sulky niggers trod on
the heels of the donkey; a lot of tents, camp-stools, tin boxes, white
cases, brown bales would be shot down in the courtyard, and the air of
mystery would deepen a little over the muddle of the station. five such
instalments came, with their absurd air of disorderly flight with the
loot of innumerable outfit shops and provision stores, that, one
would think, they were lugging, after a raid, into the wilderness for
equitable division. it was

or four pilgrims with their staves--all complete. sometimes we came
upon a station close by the bank, clinging to the skirts of the unknown,

gestures of joy and surprise and welcome, seemed very strange--had the
appearance of being held there captive by a spell. the word ivory would

a very enthralling book; but at the first glance you could see there a
singleness of intention, an honest concern for the right way of going
to work, which made these humble pages, thought out so many years ago,
luminous with another than a professional light. the simple old sailor,
with his talk of chains and purchases, made me forget the jungle and
the pilgrims in a delicious sensation of having come upon something
unmistakably real. such a book being there was wonderful enough; but
still more astounding were the notes pencilled in the margin, and
plainly referring to the text. i couldn’t believe my eyes! they were in
cipher! yes, it looked like cipher. fancy a man lugging with him a
book of that description into this nowhere and studying it--and making
notes--in cipher at that! it was an extravagant mystery.

how it struck the others: to me it seemed as though the mist itself had
screamed, so suddenly, and apparently from all sides at once, did this
tumultuous and mournful uproar arise. it culminated in a hurried
outbreak of almost intolerably excessive shrieking, which stopped short,
leaving us stiffened in a variety of silly attitudes, and obstinately
listening to the nearly as appalling and excessive silence. ‘good god!
what is the meaning--’ stammered at my elbow one of the pilgrims--a
little fat man, with sandy hair and red whiskers, who wore sidespring
boots, and pink pyjamas tucked into his socks. two others remained
open-mouthed a while minute, then dashed into the little cabin, to rush
out incontinently and stand darting scared glances, with winchesters at
‘ready’ in their hands. what we could see was just the steamer we were
on, her outlines blurred as though she had been on the point of
dissolving, and a misty strip of water, perhaps two feet broad, around

river, it didn’t enter anybody’s head to trouble how they would live.
certainly they had brought with them some rotten hippo-meat, which
couldn’t have lasted very long, anyway, even if the pilgrims hadn’t, in
the midst of a shocking hullabaloo, thrown a considerable quantity of it
overboard. it looked like a high-handed proceeding; but it was really
a case of legitimate self-defence. you can’t breathe dead hippo waking,
sleeping, and eating, and at the same time keep your precarious grip on
existence. besides that, they had given them every week three pieces of
brass wire, each about nine inches long; and the theory was they were to

unwholesome the pilgrims looked, and i hoped, yes, i positively hoped,

dazzling, to be seen, like the foam on the depths of the sea, like a
ripple on an unfathomable enigma, a mystery greater--when i thought
of it--than the curious, inexplicable note of desperate grief in this
savage clamour that had swept by us on the river-bank, behind the blind
whiteness of the fog.

given me an irresistible impression of sorrow. the glimpse of the

grief. the danger, if any, i expounded, was from our proximity to a
great human passion let loose. even extreme grief may ultimately vent
itself in violence--but more generally takes the form of apathy....

even to revile me: but i believe they thought me gone mad--with fright,

i darted out. below me there was a great scuffle of feet on the iron
deck; confused exclamations; a voice screamed, ‘can you turn back?’
i caught sight of a v-shaped ripple on the water ahead. what? another
snag! a fusillade burst out under my feet. the pilgrims had opened with
their winchesters, and were simply squirting lead into that bush. a
deuce of a lot of smoke came up and drove slowly forward. i swore at
it. now i couldn’t see the ripple or the snag either. i stood in the
doorway, peering, and the arrows came in swarms. they might have been
poisoned, but they looked as though they wouldn’t kill a cat. the bush
began to howl. our wood-cutters raised a warlike whoop; the report of a
rifle just at my back deafened me. i glanced over my shoulde

one soul in the world that was neither rudimentary nor tainted with
self-seeking. no; i can’t forget him, though i am not prepared to affirm
the fellow was exactly worth the life we lost in getting to him. i

the next.

little cabins--just a room for a bed place and a camp-stool or two,

envelopes and open letters littered his bed. his hand roamed feebly

him--factitious no doubt--to very nearly make an end of us, as you

pilgrims, was staring at the shore. i followed the direction of his
glance.

struggling, half-shaped resolve. she stood looking at us without a

fringed draperies, and she stopped as if her heart had failed her. the

touch the sky, and at the same time the swift shadows darted out on the
earth, swept around on the river, gathering the steamer into a shadowy
embrace. a formidable silence hung over the scene.

power.

ivory face the expression of sombre pride, of ruthless power, of craven

moment of complete knowledge? he cried in a whisper at some image, at
some vision--he cried out twice, a cry that was no more than a breath:

the mess-room, and i took my place opposite the manager, who lifted his
eyes to give me a questioning glance, which i successfully ignored.

unexpressed depths of his meanness. a continuous shower of small flies
streamed upon the lamp, upon the cloth, upon our hands and faces.
