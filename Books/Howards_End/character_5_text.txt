large red poppies come out.  then she walked off the lawn to
the meadow, whose corner to the right i can just see.

and she came back with her hands full of the hay that was
cut yesterday--i suppose for rabbits or something, as she
kept on smelling it.  the air here is delicious.  later on i
heard the noise of croquet balls, and looked out again, and
it was charles wilcox practising; they are keen on all
games.  presently he started sneezing and had to stop.  then
i hear more clicketing, and it is mr. wilcox practising, and
then, 'a-tissue, a-tissue': he has to stop too.  then evie
comes out, and does some calisthenic exercises on a machine
that is tacked on to a greengage-tree--they put everything
to use--and then she says 'a-tissue,' and in she goes.  and

hay and looking at the flowers.  i inflict all

futile.  a few minutes, and they were enlightened.  the
motor drew up at howards end, and helen, looking very pale,
ran out to meet her aunt.

"aunt juley, i have just had a telegram from margaret;
i--i meant to stop your coming.  it isn't--it's over."

the climax was too much for mrs. munt.  she burst into tears.

"aunt juley dear, don't.  don't let them know i've been
so silly.  it wasn't anything.  do bear up for my sake."

"paul," cried charles wilcox, pulling his gloves off.

"don't let them know.  they are never to know."

"oh, my darling helen--"

"paul!  paul!"

a very young man came out of the house.

"paul, is there any truth in this?"

"i didn't--i don't--"

"yes or no, man; plain question, plain answer.  did or
didn't miss schlegel--"

"charles dear," said a voice from the garden.  "charles,
dear charles, one doesn't ask plain questions.  there aren't
such things."

they were all silent.  it was mrs. wilcox.

good chap"--his voice dropped--"thought i should be lonely.
i didn't want him to move, but he would, and took a house at
the other end of hilton, down by the six hills.  he had a
motor, too.  there they all are, a very jolly party--he and
she and the two grandchildren."

"i manage other people's affairs so much better than
they manage them themselves," said margaret as they shook
hands.  "when you moved out of howards end, i should have
moved mr. charles wilcox into it.  i should have kept so
remarkable a place in the family."

"so it is," he replied.  "i haven't sold it, and don't
mean to."

"no; but none of you are there."

"oh, we've got a splendid tenant--hamar bryce, an
invalid.  if charles ever wanted it--but he won't.  dolly is
so dependent on modern conveniences.  no, we have all
decided against howards end.  we like it in a way, but now
we feel that it is neither one thing nor the other.  one
must have one thing or the other."

howards end.  that was something like a dear little house!
didn't you think so, aunt juley?"

" i had too much to do, dear, to look at it," said mrs.
munt, with a gracious dignity.  "i had everything to settle
and explain, and charles wilcox to keep in his place
besides.  it isn't likely i should remember much.  i just
remember having lunch in your bedroom."

"yes so do i.  but, oh dear, dear, how dead it all
seems!  and in the autumn there began this anti-pauline
movement--you, and frieda, and meg, and mrs. wilcox, all
obsessed with the idea that i might yet marry paul."

further from her husband than was inevitable.  yet the main
cause lay deeper still; she had outgrown stimulants, and was
passing from words to things.  it was doubtless a pity not
to keep up with wedekind or john, but some closing of the
gates is inevitable after thirty, if the mind itself is to
become a creative power.

she was looking at plans one day in the following
spring--they had finally decided to go down into sussex and
build--when mrs. charles wilcox was announced.

"have you heard the news?" dolly cried, as soon as she
entered the room.  "charles is so ang--i mean he is sure you
know about it, or rather, that you don't know."

"why, dolly!" said margaret, placidly kissing her.
"here's a surprise!  how are the boys and the baby?"

boys and the baby were well, and in describing a great
row that there had been at hilton tennis club, dolly forgot
her news.  the wrong people had tried to get in.  the

had descended suddenly.

"does mrs. wilcox live here?" he asked.

"she's out," was the answer.

"when will she be back?"

"i'll ask," said the parlourmaid.

margaret had given instructions that no one who
mentioned her name should ever be rebuffed.  putting the
door on the chain--for leonard's appearance demanded
this--she went through to the smoking-room, which was
occupied by tibby.  tibby was asleep.  he had had a good
lunch.  charles wilcox had not yet rung him up for the
distracting interview.  he said drowsily: "i don't know.

"i'll ask, sir."

"no, don't bother."

"they have taken the car to howards end," said the
parlourmaid to leonard.

he thanked her, and asked whereabouts that place was.

"you appear to want to know a good deal," she remarked.
but margaret had forbidden her to be mysterious.  she told
him against her better judgment that howards end was in
hertfordshire.
