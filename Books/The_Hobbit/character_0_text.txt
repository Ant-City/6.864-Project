hear a mile off. they are 
inclined to be at in the stomach; they dress in bright colours (chiefly green and yellow); 
wear no shoes, because their feet grow natural leathery soles and thick warm brown hair 
like the stuff on their heads (which is curly); have long clever brown fingers, good-
natured faces, and laugh deep fruity laughs (especially after dinner, which they have 
twice a day when they can get it). now you know enough to go on with. as i was saying, 
the mother of this hobbit - of bilbo baggins, that is - was the fabulous belladonna took, 
one of the three remarkable daughters of the old took, head of the hobbits who lived 
across the water, the small river that ran at the foot of the hill. it was often said (in 
other families) that long ago one of the took ancestors must have taken a fairy wife. 
that was, of course, absurd, but certainly there was still something not entirely hobbit-
like about them, - and once in a while members of the took-clan would go and have 
adventures.

built the most luxurious hobbit-hole for her (and 
partly with her money) that was to be found either under the hill or over the hill or 
across the water, and there they remained to the end of their days. still it is probable 
that bilbo, her only son, although he looked and behaved exactly like a second edition of 
his solid and comfortable father, got something a bit queer in his makeup from the 
took side, something that only waited for a chance to come out. the chance never 
arrived, until bilbo baggins was grown up, being about fifty years old or so, and living in 
the beautiful hobbit-hole built by his father, which i have just described for you, until he 
had in fact apparently settled down immovably. 
by some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world, when there was 
less noise and more green, and the hobbits were still numerous and prosperous, and 
bilbo baggins was standing at his door after breakfast smoking an enormous long 
wooden pipe that reached nearly down to h

a little cross. 
"good morning!" he said at last. "we don't want any adventures here, thank you! you 
might try over the hill or across the water." by this he meant that the conversation was 
at an end. 
"what a lot of things you do use good morning for!" said gandalf. "now you mean that 
you want to get rid of me, and that it won't be good till i move off." 
"not at all, not at all, my dear sir! let me see, i don't think i know your name?" 
"yes, yes, my dear sir - and i do know your name, mr. bilbo baggins. and you do know 
my name, though you don't remember that i belong to it. i am gandalf, and gandalf 
means me! to think that i should have lived to be goodmorninged by belladonna took's 
son, as if i was selling buttons at the door!" 
"gandalf, gandalf! good gracious me! not the wandering wizard that gave old took a 
pair of magic diamond studs that fastened themselves and never came undone till

ut on the kettle, and put out another cup and saucer and an extra cake 
or two, and ran to the door. 
"i am so sorry to keep you waiting!" he was going to say, when he saw that it was not 
gandalf at all. it was a dwarf with a blue beard tucked into a golden belt, and very bright 
eyes under his dark-green hood. as soon a the door was opened, he pushed inside, just 
as if he had been expected. 
he hung his hooded cloak on the nearest peg, and "dwalin at your service!" he said with 
a low bow. 
"bilbo baggins at yours!" said the hobbit, too surprised to ask any questions for the 
moment. when the silence that followed had become uncomfortable, he added: "i am 
just about to take tea; pray come and have some with me." a little stiff perhaps, but he 
meant it kindly. and what would you do, if an uninvited dwarf came and hung his things 
up in your hall without a word of explanation? 
they had not been at table long, in fact they had hardly reached the third cake, when 
there came another even louder r

gandalf-jumped to their feet and made tall piles of all the things. 
off they went, not waiting for trays, balancing columns of plates, each with a bottle on 
the top, with one hand, while the hobbit ran after them almost squeaking with fright: 
"please be careful!" and "please, don't trouble! i can manage." but the dwarves only 
started to sing: 
 
"chip the glasses and crack the plates! 
blunt the knives and bend the forks! 
that's what bilbo baggins hates- 
smash the bottles and burn the corks! 
cut the cloth and tread on the fat! 
pour the milk on the pantry floor! 
leave the bones on the bedroom mat! 
splash the wine on every door! 
dump the crocks in a boiling bawl; 
pound them up with a thumping pole; 
and when you've finished, if any are whole,

fellow conspirator, this most excellent and audacious hobbitmay the hair on his toes

remark from the hob-bit, but the compliments were quite lost on-poor bilbo baggins, who 
was wagging his mouth in protest at being called audacious and worst of all fellow 
conspirator, though no noise came out, he was so flummoxed. so thorin went on: 
"we are met to discuss our plans, our ways, means, policy and devices. we shall soon 
before the break of day start on our long journey, a journey from which some of us, or 
perhaps all of us (except our friend and counsellor, the ingenious wizard gandalf) may 
never return. it is a solemn moment. our object is, i take it, well

tried to find one; but warriors are busy fighting one another in distant lands, and in this 
neighbourhood heroes are scarce, or simply lot to be found. swords in these parts are 
mostly blunt, and axes are used for trees, and shields as cradles or dish-covers; and 
dragons are comfortably faroff (and therefore legendary). that is why i settled on 
burglary-especially when i remembered the existence of a side-door. and here is our 
little bilbo baggins, the burglar, the chosen and selected burglar. so now let's get on and 
make some plans." 
"very well then," said thorin, "supposing the burglar-expert gives us some ideas or 
suggestions." he turned with mock-politeness to bilbo. 
"first i should like to know a bit more about things," said he, feeling all confused and a 
bit shaky inside, but so far still lookishly determined to go on with things. "i mean about 
the gold and the dragon, and all that, and how it got there, and who it belongs to

ry pot and pan he possessed seemed to have been used. the washing-up 
was so dismally real that bilbo was forced to believe the party of the night before had not 
been part of his bad dreams, as he had rather hoped. 
indeed he was really relieved after all to think that they had all gone without him, and 
without bothering to wake him up ("but with never a thankyou" he thought); and yet in a 
way he could not help feeling just a trifle disappointed. the feeling surprised him. 
"don't be a fool, bilbo baggins!" he said to himself, "thinking of dragons and all that 
outlandish nonsense at your age!" so be put on an apron, lit fires, boiled water, and 
washed up. then he had a nice little breakfast in the kitchen before turning out the 
dining-room. by that time the sun was shining; and the front door was open, letting in a 
warm spring breeze. bilbo began to whistle loudly and to forget about the night before. in 
fact he was just sitting down to a nice little second breakfast in the dining-room by t

work as he lifted it carefully out, "this is a beginning!" 
it was! trolls' purses are the mischief, and this was no exception. " 
'ere, 'oo are you?" it squeaked, as it left the pocket; and william turned round at once 
and grabbed bilbo by the neck, before he could duck behind the tree. 
"blimey, bert, look what i've copped!" said william. 
"what is it?" said the others coming up. 
"lumme, if i knows! what are yer?" 
"bilbo baggins, a bur- a hobbit," said poor bilbo, shaking all over, and wondering how to 
make owl-noises before they throttled him. 

"a burrahobbit?" said they a bit startled. trolls are slow in the uptake, and mighty 
suspicious about anything new to them. 
"what's a burrahobbit got to do with my pocket, anyways?" said william. 
"and can yer cook 'em?" said tom. 
"yer can try," said bert, picking up a skewer. 
"he wouldn't make above a mouthful," said william, who had already had a fine supper,

the hobbit jumped nearly out of his skin when the hiss came in his ears, and he 
suddenly saw the pale eyes sticking out at him. 
"who are you?" he said, thrusting his dagger in front of him. 
"what iss he, my preciouss?" whispered gollum (who always spoke to himself through 
never having anyone else to speak to). this is what he had come to find out, for he was 
not really very hungry at the moment, only curious; otherwise he would have grabbed 
first and whispered afterwards. 
"i am mr. bilbo baggins. i have lost the dwarves and i have lost the wizard, and i don't 
know where i am; and "i don't want to know, if only i can get ,away." 
"what's he got in his handses?" said gollum, looking at the sword, which he did not quite 
like. 
"a sword, a blade which came out of gondolin!" 
"sssss," said gollum, and became quite polite. "praps ye sits here and chats with it a

when they got to the edge of the circle of lights they pushed bilbo suddenly from behind. 
before he had time to slip on his ring, he stumbled forward into the full blaze of the fire 
and torches. it was no good. out went all the lights again and complete darkness fell. if it 
had been difficult collecting themselves before, it was far worse this time. and they 
simply could not find the hobbit. every time they counted themselves it only made 
thirteen. they shouted and called: "bilbo baggins! hobbit! you dratted hobbit! 
hi! hobbit, confusticate you, where are you?" and other things of that sort, but there was 
no answer. 
they were just giving up hope, when dori stumbled across him by sheer luck. in the dark 
he fell over what he thought was a log, and he found it was the hobbit curled up fast 
asleep. it took a deal of shaking to wake him, and when he was awake he was not 
pleased at all. 
"i was having such a lovely dream," he grumbled, "all about having a most gorgeous 
dinner.

 hobbit slipped on his ring, and warned by the echoes to take more than 
hobbit's care to make no sound, he crept noiselessly down, down, down into the dark. 
he was trembling with fear, but his little face was set and grim. already he was a very 
different hobbit from the one that had run out without a pocket-handkerchief from bag-
end long ago. he had not had a pockethandkerchief for ages. he loosened his dagger in 
its sheath, tightened his belt, and went on. 
"now you are in for it at last, bilbo baggins," he said to himself. "you went and put your 
foot right in it that night of the party, and now you have got to pull it out and pay for it! 
dear me, what a fool i was and am!" said the least tookish part of him. "i have 
absolutely no use for dragon-guarded treasures, and the whole lot could stay here for 
ever, if only i could wake up and find this beastly tunnel was my own front-hall at home!" 
he did not wake up of course, but went still on and on, till all sign of the door behind had

"servant, indeed!" snorted bilbo; and in the middle of his snort he sneezed loudly, and 
the elves immediately gathered towards the sound. 
"let's have a light!" he said. "i am here, if you want me!" and he slipped off his ring, and 
popped from behind a rock. 
they seized him quickly, in spite of their surprise. "who are you? are you the dwarves' 
hobbit? what are you doing? how did you get so far past our sentinels?" they asked one 
after another. 
"i am mr. bilbo baggins," he answered, "companion of thorin, if you want to know. i 
know your king well by sight, though perhaps he doesn't know me to look at. but bard 
will remember me, and it is bard i particularly want to see." 
"indeed!" said they, "and what may be your business?" 
"whatever it is, it's my own, my good elves. but if you wish ever to get back to your own 
woods from this cold cheerless place," he answered shivering, "you will take me along 
quiet to a fire, where i can dry-and then you will let m

hough dazed. 
"but how is it yours to give?" he asked at last with an effort. 
"o well!" said the hobbit uncomfortably. "it isn't exactly; but, well, i am willing to let it 
stand against all my claim, don't you know. i may be a burglar-or so they say: personally 
i never really felt like one-but i am an honest one, i hope, more or less. anyway i am 
going back now, and the dwarves can do what they like to me. i hope you will find it 
useful." 
the elvenking looked at bilbo with a new wonder. 
"bilbo baggins!" he said. "you are more worthy to wear the armour of elfprinces than 
many that have looked more comely in it. but i wonder if thorin oakenshield will see it 
so. i have more knowledge of dwarves in general than you have perhaps. i advise you to 
remain with us, and here you shall be honoured and thrice welcome." 
"thank you very much i am sure," said bilbo with a bow. "but i don't think i ought to 
leave my friends like this, after all we have gone through together. and i promised to

it seems a very gloomy business." 
suddenly he was aware of a man climbing up and coming towards him. 
"hullo there!" he called with a shaky voice. "hullo there! what news?" 
"what voice is it that speaks among the stones?" said the man halting and peering about 
him not far from where bilbo sat. 
then bilbo remembered his ring! "well i'm blessed!" said he. "this invisibility has its 
drawbacks after all. otherwise i suppose i might have spent a warm and comfortable 
night in bed!" 
"it's me, bilbo baggins, companion of thorin!" he cried, hurriedly taking 
off the ring. 
"it is well that i have found you!" said the man striding forward. "you are needed and we 
have looked for you long. you would have been numbered among the dead, who are 
many, if gandalf the wizard had not said that your voice was last heard in this place. i 
have been sent to look here for the last time. are you much hurt?" 
"a nasty knock on the head, i think," said bilbo. "but i have a helm and a hard skull. all

e was a great commotion, 
and people of all sorts, respectable and unrespectable, were thick round the door, and 
many were going in and out-not even wiping their feet on the mat, as bilbo noticed with 
annoyance. 
if he was surprised, they were more surprised still. he had arrived back in the middle of 
an auction! there was a large notice in black and red hung on the gate, stating that on 
june the twenty-second messrs. grubb, grubb, and bun-owes would sell by auction the 
effects of the late bilbo baggins esquire, of bag-end, underhill, hobbiton. sale to 
commence at ten o'clock sharp. it was now nearly lunch-time, and most of the things had 
already been sold, for various prices from next to nothing to old songs (as is not unusual 
at auctions). bilbo's cousins the sackville-bagginses were, in fact, busy measuring his 
rooms to see if their own furniture would fit. in short bilbo was "presumed dead," and 
not everybody that said so was sorry to find the presumption wrong.
