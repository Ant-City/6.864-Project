[CHARACTER] - 
                    a
wise old wizard who always seems to know more than he reveals. [CHARACTER]
has a vast command of magic and tends to show up at just the moment
he is needed most. though he helps the dwarves in their quest (not least
by making bilbo go along with them), he does not seem to have any
interest in their gold. he always has another purpose or plan in
mind, but he rarely reveals his private thoughts.
