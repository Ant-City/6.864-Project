the jungle


chapter 1


it was four o’clock when the ceremony was over and the carriages began
to arrive. there had been a crowd following all the way, owing to the
exuberance of marija berczynskas. the occasion rested heavily upon
marija’s broad shoulders--it was her task to see that all things went in
due form, and after the best home traditions; and, flying wildly
hither and thither, bowling every one out of the way, and scolding and
exhorting all day with her tremendous voice, marija was too eager to see
that others conformed to the proprieties to consider them herself. she
had left the church last of all, and, desiring to arrive first at the
hall, had issued orders to the coachman

and half a minute later there appears old grandmother majauszkiene, with
a big yellow bowl of smoking potatoes, nearly as big as herself. so, bit
by bit, the feast takes form--there is a ham and a dish of sauerkraut,
boiled rice, macaroni, bologna sausages, great piles of penny buns,
bowls of milk, and foaming pitchers of beer. there is also, not six feet
from your back, the bar, where you may order all you please and do not
have to pay for it. “eiksz! graicziau!” screams marija berczynskas, and
falls to work herself--for there is more upon the stove inside that will
be spoiled if it be not eaten.

so, with laughter and shouts and endless badinage and merriment, the
guests take their places. the young men, who for the most part have
been huddled near the door, summon their resolution and advance; and the
shrinking jurgis is poked and scolded by the old folks until he consents
to seat himself at the right hand of the bride. the two bridesmaids,
whose insignia of office are paper wr

then the tears begin to come into her eyes; and as she is ashamed to
wipe them away, and ashamed to let them run down her cheeks, she turns
and shakes her head a little, and then flushes red when she sees that
jurgis is watching her. when in the end tamoszius kuszleika has reached
her side, and is waving his magic wand above her, ona’s cheeks are
scarlet, and she looks as if she would have to get up and run away.

in this crisis, however, she is saved by marija berczynskas, whom
the muses suddenly visit. marija is fond of a song, a song of lovers’
parting; she wishes to hear it, and, as the musicians do not know it,
she has risen, and is proceeding to teach them. marija is short, but
powerful in build. she works in a canning factory, and all day long she
handles cans of beef that weigh fourteen pounds. she has a broad
slavic face, with prominent red cheeks. when she opens her mouth, it
is tragical, but you cannot help thinking of a horse. she wears a blue

the musicians had spent all their fine frenzy by now, and played only
one tune, wearily, ploddingly. there were twenty bars or so of it, and
when they came to the end they began again. once every ten minutes or so
they would fail to begin again, but instead would sink back exhausted; a
circumstance which invariably brought on a painful and terrifying scene,
that made the fat policeman stir uneasily in his sleeping place behind
the door.

it was all marija berczynskas. marija was one of those hungry souls who
cling with desperation to the skirts of the retreating muse. all day
long she had been in a state of wonderful exaltation; and now it was
leaving--and she would not let it go. her soul cried out in the words of
faust, “stay, thou art fair!” whether it was by beer, or by shouting, or
by music, or by motion, she meant that it should not go. and she would
go back to the chase of it--and no sooner be fairly started than her
chariot would be thrown off t

modern methods a very few men can do the painfully necessary work of
head-cracking for the whole of the cultured world.

there is no fight that night--perhaps because jurgis, too, is
watchful--even more so than the policeman. jurgis has drunk a great
deal, as any one naturally would on an occasion when it all has to be
paid for, whether it is drunk or not; but he is a very steady man, and
does not easily lose his temper. only once there is a tight shave--and
that is the fault of marija berczynskas. marija has apparently concluded
about two hours ago that if the altar in the corner, with the deity in
soiled white, be not the true home of the muses, it is, at any rate,
the nearest substitute on earth attainable. and marija is just fighting
drunk when there come to her ears the facts about the villains who have
not paid that night. marija goes on the warpath straight off, without
even the preliminary of a good cursing, and when she is pulled off it
is with the coat collars of two villains i

l the time of ona; and for the
rest, he was a quiet, steady man, who did what he was told to, did not
lose his temper often, and when he did lose it made the offender anxious
that he should not lose it again. when they paid him off he dodged the
company gamblers and dramshops, and so they tried to kill him; but he
escaped, and tramped it home, working at odd jobs, and sleeping always
with one eye open.

so in the summer time they had all set out for america. at the last
moment there joined them marija berczynskas, who was a cousin of ona’s.
marija was an orphan, and had worked since childhood for a rich farmer
of vilna, who beat her regularly. it was only at the age of twenty that
it had occurred to marija to try her strength, when she had risen up and
nearly murdered the man, and then come away.

there were twelve in all in the party, five adults and six children--and
ona, who was a little of both. they had a hard time on the passage;
there was an agent who helped them, but he proved a scoundrel, and

at home, also, there was more good news; so much of it at once that
there was quite a celebration in aniele’s hall bedroom. jonas had been
to have an interview with the special policeman to whom szedvilas had
introduced him, and had been taken to see several of the bosses, with
the result that one had promised him a job the beginning of the next
week. and then there was marija berczynskas, who, fired with jealousy by
the success of jurgis, had set out upon her own responsibility to get a
place. marija had nothing to take with her save her two brawny arms
and the word “job,” laboriously learned; but with these she had marched
about packingtown all day, entering every door where there were signs of
activity. out of some she had been ordered with curses; but marija was
not afraid of man or devil, and asked every one she saw--visitors and
strangers, or work-people like herself,

returning--the fact that they had left packingtown. “all right,” he
said, “i’ll go.”

so she gave him a number on clark street, adding, “there’s no need
to give you my address, because marija knows it.” and jurgis set out,
without further ado. he found a large brownstone house of aristocratic
appearance, and rang the basement bell. a young colored girl came to the
door, opening it about an inch, and gazing at him suspiciously.

“what do you want?” she demanded.

“does marija berczynskas live here?” he inquired.

“i dunno,” said the girl. “what you want wid her?”

“i want to see her,” said he; “she’s a relative of mine.”

the girl hesitated a moment. then she opened the door and said, “come
in.” jurgis came and stood in the hall, and she continued: “i’ll go see.
what’s yo’ name?”

“tell her it’s jurgis,” he answered, and the girl went upstairs. she
came back at the end of a minute or two, and replied, “dey ain’t no sich
person here.
