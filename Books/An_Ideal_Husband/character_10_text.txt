_the library in lord goring’s house_.  _an adam room_.  _on the right is
the door leading into the hall_.  _on the left_, _the door of the
smoking-room_.  _a pair of folding doors at the back open into the
drawing-room_.  _the fire is lit_.  _phipps_, _the butler_, _is arranging
some newspapers on the writing-table_.  _the distinction of phipps is his
impassivity_. _he has been termed by enthusiasts the ideal butler_.  _the
sphinx is not so incommunicable_.  _he is a mask with a manner_.  _of his
intellectual or emotional life_, _history knows nothing_.  _he represents
the dominance of form_.

lord goring.  got my second buttonhole for me, phipps?

phipps.  yes, my lord.  [_takes his hat_, _cane_, _and cape_, _and
presents new buttonhole on salver_.]

lord goring.  rather distinguished thing, phipps.  i am the only person
of the smallest importance in london at present who wears a buttonhole.

phipps.  yes, my lord.  i have observed that,

lord goring.  [_taking out old buttonhole_.]  you see, phipps, fashion is
what one wears oneself.  what is unfashionable is what other people wear.

phipps.  yes, my lord.

lord goring.  just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people.

phipps.  yes, my lord.

phipps.  yes, my lord.

lord goring.  other people are quite dreadful.  the only possible society
is oneself.

phipps.  yes, my lord.

lord goring.  to love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance,
phipps.

phipps.  yes, my lord.

lord goring.  [_looking at himself in the glass_.]  don’t think i quite
like this buttonhole, phipps.  makes me look a little too old.  makes me
almost in the prime of life, eh, phipps?

phipps.  i don’t observe any alteration in your lordship’s appearance.

lord goring.  you don’t, phipps?

phipps.  no, my lord.

lord goring.  i am not quite sure.  for the future a more trivial
buttonhole, phipps, on thursday evenings.

phipps.  i will speak to the florist, my lord.  she has had a loss in her
family lately, which perhaps accounts for the lack of triviality your
lordship complains of in the buttonhole.

lord goring.  extraordinary thing about the lower classes in england—they

are always losing their relations.

phipps.  yes, my lord!  they are extremely fortunate in that respect.

lord goring.  [_turns round and looks at him_.  phipps _remains
impassive_.]  hum!  any letters, phipps?

phipps.  three, my lord.  [_hands letters on a salver_.]

lord goring.  [_takes letters_.]  want my cab round in twenty minutes.

phipps.  yes, my lord.  [_goes towards door_.]

lord goring.  [_holds up letter in pink envelope_.]  ahem!  phipps, when
did this letter arrive?

phipps.  it was brought by hand just after your lordship went to the
club.

lord goring.  that will do.  [_exit_ phipps.]  lady chiltern’s
handwriting on lady chiltern’s pink notepaper.  that is rather curious.
i thought robert was to write.  wonder what lady chiltern has got to say
to me?  [_sits at bureau and opens letter_, _and reads it_.]  ‘i want
you.  i trust you.  i am coming to you.  gertrude.’  [_puts down the
letter with a puzzled look_.  _then takes it up_, _and reads it again

give up going to the berkshires.  however, it is always nice to be
expected, and not to arrive.  i am not expected at the bachelors’, so i
shall certainly go there.  well, i will make her stand by her husband.
that is the only thing for her to do.  that is the only thing for any
woman to do.  it is the growth of the moral sense in women that makes
marriage such a hopeless, one-sided institution.  ten o’clock.  she
should be here soon.  i must tell phipps i am not in to any one else.

lord goring.  so do i, father.  it is a dreadful draught.  i will come
and see you to-morrow, father.  we can talk over anything you like.  let
me help you on with your cloak, father.

lord caversham.  no, sir; i have called this evening for a definite
purpose, and i am going to see it through at all costs to my health or
yours.  put down my cloak, sir.

lord goring.  certainly, father.  but let us go into another room.
[_rings bell_.]  there is a dreadful draught here.  [_enter_ phipps.]
phipps, is there a good fire in the smoking-room?

phipps.  yes, my lord.

lord goring.  come in there, father.  your sneezes are quite
heartrending.

lord caversham.  well, sir, i suppose i have a right to sneeze when i
choose?

lord goring.  [_apologetically_.]  quite so, father.  i was merely
expressing sympathy.

lord caversham.  oh, damn sympathy.  there is a great deal too much of
that sort of thing going on nowadays.

lord goring.  i quite agree with you, father.  if there was less sym

lord goring.  so do i, father.  everybody one meets is a paradox
nowadays.  it is a great bore.  it makes society so obvious.

lord caversham.  [_turning round_, _and looking at his son beneath his
bushy eyebrows_.]  do you always really understand what you say, sir?

lord goring.  [_after some hesitation_.]  yes, father, if i listen
attentively.

lord caversham.  [_indignantly_.]  if you listen attentively! . . .
conceited young puppy!

[_goes off grumbling into the smoking-room_.  phipps _enters_.]

lord goring.  phipps, there is a lady coming to see me this evening on
particular business.  show her into the drawing-room when she arrives.
you understand?

phipps.  yes, my lord.

lord goring.  it is a matter of the gravest importance, phipps.

phipps.  i understand, my lord.

lord goring.  no one else is to be admitted, under any circumstances.

phipps.  i understand, my lord.  [_bell rings_.]

lord goring.  ah! that is probably the lady.  i shall see her myself.

lord caversham.  well, sir? am i to wait attendance on you?

lord goring.  [_considerably perplexed_.]  in a moment, father.  do
excuse me.  [lord caversham _goes back_.]  well, remember my
instructions, phipps—into that room.

phipps.  yes, my lord.

[lord goring _goes into the smoking-room_.  harold, _the footman shows_
mrs. cheveley _in_.  _lamia-like_, _she is in green and silver_.  _she
has a cloak of black satin_, _lined with dead rose-leaf silk_.]

harold.  what name, madam?

mrs. cheveley.  [_to_ phipps, _who advances towards her_.]  is lord
goring not here?  i was told he was at home?

phipps.  his lordship is engaged at present with lord caversham, madam.

es_.]

mrs. cheveley.  [_to herself_.]  how very filial!

phipps.  his lordship told me to ask you, madam, to be kind enough to
wait in the drawing-room for him.  his lordship will come to you there.

mrs. cheveley.  [_with a look of surprise_.]  lord goring expects me?

phipps.  yes, madam.

mrs. cheveley.  are you quite sure?

phipps.  his lordship told me that if a lady called i was to ask her to
wait in the drawing-room.  [_goes to the door of the drawing-room and
opens it_.]  his lordship’s directions on the subject were very precise.

mrs. cheveley.  [_to herself_]  how thoughtful of him!  to expect the
unexpected shows a thoroughly modern intellect.  [_goes towards the
drawing-room and looks in_.]  ugh!  how dreary a bachelor’s drawing-room
always looks.  i shall have to alter all this.  [phipps _brings the lamp

glaring.  light some candles.

phipps.  [_replaces lamp_.]  certainly, madam.

mrs. cheveley.  i hope the candles have very becoming shades.

phipps.  we have had no complaints about them, madam, as yet.

[_passes into the drawing-room and begins to light the candles_.]

mrs. cheveley.  [_to herself_.]  i wonder what woman he is waiting for
to-night.  it will be delightful to catch him.  men always look so silly
when they are caught.  and they are always being caught.  [_looks about
room and approaches the writing-table_.]  what a very interesting room!
what a very interesting picture!  wonder what his correspondence is like.

gertrude chiltern’s.  i remember it perfectly.  the ten commandments in
every stroke of the pen, and the moral law all over the page.  wonder
what gertrude is writing to him about?  something horrid about me, i
suppose.  how i detest that woman!  [_reads it_.]  ‘i trust you.  i want
you.  i am coming to you.  gertrude.’  ‘i trust you.  i want you.  i am
coming to you.’

[_a look of triumph comes over her face_.  _she is just about to steal
the letter_, _when_ phipps _comes in_.]

phipps.  the candles in the drawing-room are lit, madam, as you directed.

mrs. cheveley.  thank you.  [_rises hastily and slips the letter under a
large silver-cased blotting-book that is lying on the table_.]

phipps.  i trust the shades will be to your liking, madam.  they are the
most becoming we have.  they are the same as his lordship uses himself
when he is dressing for dinner.

mrs. cheveley.  [_with a smile_.]  then i am sure they will be perfectly
right.

[mrs. cheveley _goes into the drawing-room_.  phipps _closes the door and
retires_.  _the door is then slowly opened_, _and_ mrs. cheveley _comes
out and creeps stealthily towards the writing-table_.  _suddenly voices
are heard from the smoking-room_.  mrs. cheveley _grows pale_, _and
stops_.  _the voices grow louder_, _and she goes back into the
drawing-room_, _biting her lip_.]

lord goring.  and thunderingly well they do it.

sir robert chiltern.  arthur, i am parched with thirst.  may i ring for
something?  some hock and seltzer?

lord goring.  certainly.  let me.  [_rings the bell_.]

sir robert chiltern.  thanks!  i don’t know what to do, arthur, i don’t
know what to do, and you are my only friend.  but what a friend you
are—the one friend i can trust.  i can trust you absolutely, can’t i?

lord goring.  my dear robert, of course.  oh!  [_to_ phipps.]  bring some
hock and seltzer.

phipps.  yes, my lord.

lord goring.  and phipps!

phipps.  yes, my lord.

lord goring.  will you excuse me for a moment, robert?  i want to give
some directions to my servant.

sir robert chiltern.  certainly.

lord goring.  when that lady calls, tell her that i am not expected home
this evening.  tell her that i have been suddenly called out of town.
you understand?

lord goring.  you did perfectly right.  [_exit_ phipps.]  what a mess i

through the door.  awkward thing to manage, though.

sir robert chiltern.  arthur, tell me what i should do.  my life seems to
have crumbled about me.  i am a ship without a rudder in a night without
a star.

lord goring.  robert, you love your wife, don’t you?

sir robert chiltern.  i love her more than anything in the world.  i used
to think ambition the great thing.  it is not.  love is the great thing

side, from my stand-point, from the standpoint of men.  but don’t let us
talk of that.

lord goring.  your wife will forgive you.  perhaps at this moment she is
forgiving you.  she loves you, robert.  why should she not forgive?

sir robert chiltern.  god grant it!  god grant it!  [_buries his face in
his hands_.]  but there is something more i have to tell you, arthur.

phipps.  [_hands hock and seltzer to_ sir robert chiltern.]  hock and
seltzer, sir.

sir robert chiltern.  thank you.

lord goring.  is your carriage here, robert?

sir robert chiltern.  no; i walked from the club.

lord goring.  sir robert will take my cab, phipps.

phipps.  yes, my lord.  [_exit_.]

back that letter.  i’ll take it from you by force.  you shall not leave
my room till i have got it.

[_he rushes towards her_, _but_ mrs. cheveley _at once puts her hand on
the electric bell that is on the table_. _the bell sounds with shrill
reverberations_, _and_ phipps _enters_.]

mrs. cheveley.  [_after a pause_.]  lord goring merely rang that you
should show me out.  good-night, lord goring!

[_goes out followed by_ phipps.  _her face it illumined with evil
triumph_.  _there is joy in her eyes_.  _youth seems to have come back to
her_.  _her last glance is like a swift arrow_.  lord goring _bites his
lip_, _and lights his a cigarette_.]
