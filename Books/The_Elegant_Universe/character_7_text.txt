as with many issues of great importance, for each of these naysayers, there is an enthusiastic
supporter. witten has said that when he learned how string theory incorporates gravity and quantum
mechanics, it was "the greatest intellectual thrill" of his life.8 cumrun vafa, a leading string theorist
from harvard university, has said that "string theory is definitely revealing the deepest understanding
of the universe which we have ever had."9 and nobel prizeâ€“winner murray gell-mann has said that
string theory is "a fantastic thing" and that he expects that some version of string theory will someday
be the theory of the whole world.10

as you can see, the debate is fueled in part by physics and in part by distinct philosophies about
how  physics  should  be  done.  the  "traditionalists"  want  theoretical  work  to  be  closely  tied  to
experimental observation, largely in the successful research mold of the last few centuries. but others
think that we are ready to tackle
