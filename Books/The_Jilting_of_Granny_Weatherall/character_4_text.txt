re jilted, werenâ€™t you? then stand 
up to it. her eyelids wavered and let in streamers of blue-gray light like tissue paper 
over her eyes. she must get up and pull the shades down or sheâ€™d never sleep. she was 
in bed again and the shades were not down. how could that happen? better turn over, 
hide from the light, sleeping in the light gave you nightmares. â€œmother, how do you 
feel now?â€ and a stinging wetness on her forehead. but i donâ€™t like having my face 
washed in cold water! 

hapsy? george? lydia? jimmy? no, cornelia, and her features were swollen and 
full of little puddles. â€œtheyâ€™re coming, darling, theyâ€™ll all be here soon.â€ go wash your 
face, child, you look funny. 

instead of obeying, cornelia knelt down and put her head on the pillow. she 

seemed to be talking but there was no sound. 

â€œwell, are you tongue-tied? whose birthday is it? are you going to give a party?â€ 

corneliaâ€™s mouth moved urgently in strange shapes. â€œdonâ€™t do that, you bother

she thought she spoke up loudly, but no one answered. a warm weight on her 

forehead, a warm bracelet on her wrist, and a breeze went on whispering, trying to tell 
her something. a shuffle of leaves in the everlasting hand of god. he blew on them 
and they danced and rattled. â€œmother, donâ€™t mind, weâ€™re going to give you a little 
hypodermic.â€ â€œlook here, daughter, how do ants get in this bed? i saw sugar ants 
yesterday.â€ did you send for hapsy too? 

it was hapsy she really wanted. she had to go a long way back through a great 

many rooms to find hapsy standing with a baby on her arm. she seemed to herself to 
be hapsy also, and the baby on hapsyâ€™s arm was hapsy and himself and herself, all at

once, and there was no surprise in the meeting. then hapsy melted from within and 
turned flimsy as gray gauze and baby was a gauzy shadow, and hapsy came up close 
and said, â€œi thought youâ€™d

on it, 
just as before. he had cursed like a sailorâ€™s parrot and said, â€œiâ€™ll kill him for you.â€ donâ€™t 
lay a hand on him, for my sake leave something to god. â€œnow, ellen, you must believe 
what i tell youâ€¦â€ 

so there was nothing, nothing to worry about any more, except sometimes in the 
night one of the children screamed in a nightmare, and they both hustled out shaking 
and hunting for the matches and calling, â€œthere, wait a minute, here we are!â€ john, 
get the doctor now. hapsyâ€™s time has come. but there was hapsy standing by the bed 
in a white cap. 

â€œcornelia, tell hapsy to take off her cap. i canâ€™t see her plain.â€ 

her eyes opened very wide and the room stood out like a picture she had seen 

somewhere. dark colors with the shadows rising towards the ceiling in long angles. the 
tall black dresser gleamed with nothing on it but johnâ€™s picture, enlarged from a little 
one, with johnâ€™s eyes very black when they should have been blue. you never saw him,

a thank you in the bargain. 

light flashed on her closed eyelids, and a deep roaring shook her. cornelia, is that 

lightning? i hear thunder. thereâ€™s going to be a storm. close all the windows. call the 
children in... â€œmother, where we are, all of us.â€ â€œis that you, hapsy?â€ â€œoh, no, iâ€™m 
lydia. we drove as fast as we could.â€ their faces drifted above her, drifted away. the 
rosary fell out of her hands and lydia put it back. jimmy tried to help, their hands 
fumbled together, and granny closed two fingers around jimmyâ€™s thumb. beads 
wouldnâ€™t do it, it must be something alive. she was so amazed her thoughts ran round 
and round. so, my dear lord, this is my death and i wasnâ€™t even thinking about it. my 
children have come to see me die. but i canâ€

™t, itâ€™s not time. oh, i always hated 
surprises. i wanted to give cornelia the amethyst set â€“ cornelia, youâ€™re to have the 
amethyst set, but hapsyâ€™ to wear it when she wants, and, doctor harry, do shut up. 
nobody sent for you. oh, my dear lord, do wait a minute. i meant to do something 
about the forty acres, jimmy doesnâ€™t need it and lydia will later on, with that 
worthless husband of hers. i meant to finish the altar cloth and send six bottles of wine 
to sister borgia for her dyspepsia. i want to send six bottles of wine to sister borgia, 
father connolly, now donâ€™t let me forget. 
corneliaâ€™s voice made short turns and tilted

 over and crashed. â€œoh, mother, oh, 
mother, oh, motherâ€¦â€ 

â€œiâ€™m not going cornelia. iâ€™m taken by surprise. i canâ€™t go.â€ 

youâ€™ll see hapsy again. what about her? â€œi thought youâ€™d never come.â€ granny 

made a long journey outward, looking for hapsy. what if i donâ€™t find her? what then? 
her heart sank down and down, there was no bottom to death, she couldnâ€™t come to 
the end of it. the blue light from corneliaâ€™s lampshade drew into a tiny point in the 
center of her brain, it flickered and winked like an eye, quietly it fluttered and 
dwindled. granny lay curled down within herself, amazed and watchful, staring at the 
point of light that was herself; her body was now only a deeper mass of shadow in an 
endless darkness and this dar
