never, most equal sisters, had any man a wit so presently excellent, as
that it could raise itself; but there must come both matter, occasion,
commenders, and favourers to it. if this be true, and that the fortune
of all writers doth daily prove it, it behoves the careful to provide
well towards these accidents; and, having acquired them, to preserve
that part of reputation most tenderly, wherein the benefit of a friend
is also defended. hence is it, that i now render myself gr

     i'm heartily grieved, a beard of your grave length
     should be so over-reach'd. i never brook'd
     that parasite's hair; methought his nose should cozen:
     there still was somewhat in his look, did promise
     the bane of a clarissimo.

     corb: knave--

     volp: methinks
     yet you, that are so traded in the world,
     a witty merchant, the fine

     it cannot be, sir, that you should be cozen'd;
     'tis not within the wit of man to do it;
     you are so wise, so prudent; and 'tis fit
     that wealth and wisdom still should go together.

     volt: o, my most honour'd fathers, let your mercy
     once win upon your justice, to forgive--
     i am distracted--

     volp [aside.]: what will he do now?

     volt: o,
     i know not which to address myself to first;
     whether your fatherhoods, or these innocents--

     corv [aside.]: will he betray himself?

     1 avoc: speak forward.

     com: silence!

     volt: it is not passion in me, reverend fathers,
     but only conscience, conscience, my good sires,
     that makes me now tell trueth. that parasite,
     that knave, hath been the instrument of all.

     1 avoc: where is that knave? fetch him.

     volp: i go.

     corv: grave fathers,
     this man's distracted; he confest it now:
     for, hoping to be old volpone's heir,
     who now is dead--

     3 avoc: how?

     2 avoc: is volpone dead?

     corv: dead since, grave fathers--

     bon: o sure vengeance!

     1 avoc: stay,
     then he was no deceiver?

     volt: o no, none:
     the parasite, grave fathers.

     corv: he does speak
     out of mere envy, 'cause the servant's made
     the thing he gaped for: please your fatherhoods,
     this is the truth, though i'll not justify
     the other, but he may be some-deal faulty.

     corb: so is the parasite too.

     1 avoc: this is confusion.

     volp: to make a snare for mine own neck! and run
     my head into it, wilfully! with laughter!
     when i had newly 'scaped, was free, and clear,
     out of mere wantonness! o, the dull devil
     was in this brain of mine, when i devised it,
     and mosca gave it second; he must now
     help to sear up this vein, or we bleed dead.--

     and that the gentlewoman was brought thither,

     1 avoc: but that
     volpone would have ravish'd her, he holds
     utterly false; knowing his impotence.

     corv: grave fathers, he's possest; again, i say,
     possest: nay, if there be possession, and
     obsession, he has both.

     3 avoc: here comes our officer.

     volp: the parasite will straight be here, grave fathers.

     volp [whispers volt.]: deny it, sir, forswear it; know it not.

     volt: yes, i do know it well, it is my hand;
     but all that it contains is false.

     bon: o practice!

     2 avoc: what maze is this!

     1 avoc: is he not guilty then,
     whom you there name the parasite?

     volt: grave fathers,
     no more than his good patron, old volpone.

     4 avoc: why, he is dead.

     volt: o no, my honour'd fathers,
     he lives--

     1 avoc: how! lives?

     volt: lives.

     2 avoc: this is subtler yet!

     3 avoc: you said he was dead.

     more intricate!

     4 avoc [aside.]: it is a match, my daughter is bestow'd.

     your voice is good, cry not so loud.

     1 avoc: demand
     the advocate.--sir, did not you affirm,
     volpone was alive?

     volp: yes, and he is;
     this gentleman told me so.
     [aside to volp.]
     --thou shalt have half.--

     mos: whose drunkard is this same? speak, some that know him:
     i never saw his face.

     afford it you so cheap.

     volp: no!

     1 avoc: what say you?

     volp: i did, grave fathers,
     and will maintain he lives, with mine own life.

     --i was born,

     upon me, i am silent: 'twas not this
     for which you sent, i hope.

     2 avoc: take him away.

     volp: mosca!

     3 avoc: let him be whipt.

     volp: wilt thou betray me?
     cozen me?

     toward a person of his rank.

     4 avoc: away.

     volp [aside.]: soft, soft: whipt!
     and lose all that i have! if i confess,
     it cannot be much more.

     4 avoc: sir, are you married?

     volp: they will be allied anon; i must be resolute:
     the fox shall here uncase.
     [throws off his disguise.]

     mos: patron!

     volp: nay, now,
     my ruins shall not come alone; your match
     i'll hinder sure: my substance shall not glue you,
     nor screw you into a family.

     this [to corv.], a chimera of wittol, fool, and knave:

     nought but a sentence, let's not now dispair it.

     now, though the fox be punish'd by the laws,
     he yet doth hope, there is no suffering due,
