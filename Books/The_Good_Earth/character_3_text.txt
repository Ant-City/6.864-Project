ndfather's bed.

and again the harvests were good and wang lung gath-
ered silver from the selling of his produce and again he
hid it in the wall. but the rice he reaped from the land of
[the hwangs brought him twice as much as that from his
own rice land. the earth of that piece was wet and rich
and the rice grew on it as weeds grow where they are not
wanted. and every one knew now that wang lung owned
this land and in his village there was talk of making him

wang lung's uncle began at this time to
become the trouble that from the beginning wang lung
had surmised he might become. this uncle was the younger
brother of wang lung's father, and by all the claims of
relationship he might depend upon wang lung if he had
not enough for himself and his family. so long as wang
lung and his father were poor and scantily fed the uncle
made muster to scratch about on his land and gather
enough to feed his seven children and his wife and himself.
but once fed none of them worked.

he will give none of it to us, not even to me, and to my
children, who are his own bones and flesh. we can do
nothing but starve.'

and as family after family finished its store in the small
village and spent its last coin in the scanty markets of the
town, and the winds of winter came down from the desert,
cold as a knife of steel and dry and barren, the hearts
of the villagers grew distraught with their own hunger
and with the hunger of their pinched wives and crying
children, and when wang lung's uncle shivered about the
streets like a lean dog and whispered from his famished
lips, 'there is one who has food — there is one whose
children are fat, still,' the men took up poles and went one
night to the house of wang lung and beat upon the door.
and when he had opened to the voices of his neighbours,
they fell upon him and pushed him out of the doorway
and threw out of the house his frightened children, and
they fell upon every corner, and they scrabbled every surface
with their hands to find

answered tranquillly:

'it is less than the cost of one bed, but if you have the
silver give it to me quickly and take the things.'

the one-eyed man fumbled in his girdle and dropped
the silver into her outstretched hand, and the three men
came into the house and between them they took out the
table and the benches and the bed in wang lung's room
i with its bedding, and they wrenched the cauldron from the
i earthen oven in which it stood. but when they went into
the old man's room wang lung's uncle stood outside. he
mid not wish his elder brother to see him, nor did he wish
to be there when the old man was laid on the floor and
the bed taken from under him. when all was finished and
the house was wholly empty except for the two rakes and
the two hoes and the plough in one corner of the middle
room, o-lan said to her husband:

'let us go while we have the two bits of silver and
before we must sell the rafters of the house and have no
hole into which we can crawl when we return.'

light of the sun, and he laughed.

but o-lan returned to the beating of his clothes, and }
when tears dropped slowly and heavily from her eyes she
did not put up her hand to wipe them away; only she beat
the more steadily with her wooden stick upon the clothes
spread over the stone.

and thus it might have gone on until all the
silver was spent, had not that one, wang lung's uncle
returned suddenly without explanation of where he had
been or of what he had done. he stood in the door as
though he had dropped from a cloud, his ragged clothes
unbuttoned and girdled loosely as ever about him, and his
face as it always was but wrinkled and hardened with the
sun and the wind. he grinned widely at them all as they
sat about the table at their early morning meal, and wang
lung sat agape, for he had forgotten that his uncle lived
and it was like a dead man returning to see him. t

cle's wife and son would be courteous
enough for the sake of their food and their shelter, then
his thoughts turned more violently than ever to the girl
lotus and he muttered to himself:

'when a man's house is full of wild dogs he must seek
peace elsewhere.'

and all the old fever and pain burned in him and he
was still never satisfied of his love.

now what o-lan had not seen in her simplicity nor the
old man because of the dimness of his age nor ching be-
cause of his friendship, the wife of wang lung's uncle
saw at once and she cried out, the laughter slanting from
her eyes:

'now wang lung is seeking to pluck a flower some-
where.' and when o-lan looked at her humbly, not un-
derstanding, she laughed and said again, 'the melon must
always be spilt wide open before you can see the seeds,
eh? well, then, plainly, your man is mad over another
woman!'

this wang lung heard his uncle's wife say in the court
outside his window as he lay dozing and weary in his room
one early morning, exhausted with his

 there was none to see her pass, for j
he had sent the labourers and ching away for the day to j
work on a distant field, and o-lan had gone somewhere he
knew not and had taken the two little ones with her and
the boys were in school and the old man slept against the
wall and heard and saw nothing, and as for the poor fool, j
she saw no one who came and went and knew no face
except her father's and her mother's. but when lotus had
gone in cuckoo drew the curtains after her. j

then after a time wang lung's uncle's wife came out,
laughing a little maliciously, and she dusted her hands
together as though to free them of something that clung
to them.

'she reeks of perfume and paint, that one,' she said still
laughing, 'like a regular bad one she smells.' and then
she said with a deeper malice, 'she is not so young as she i \
looks, my nephew ! i will dare to say this, that if she had \
not been on the edge of an age when men will cease soon j j
to look at her, it is doubtful whether jade in her ears and

 how she did she said no more than this: i

her belly was as great as though with child these three
years, only there was no birth. but she rose at dawn and /

keenly as he might see one of the oxen drooping its head

or a pig that would not eat. and she did her work alone
and spoke no more than she could escape speaking with
the wife of wang lung's uncle, and she never spoke at all
to cuckoo. never once had o-lan gone into the inner
courts, and rarely, if lotus came out to walk a little in a
place other than her own court, o-lan went into her room
and sat until one said, 4 she is gone.' and she said nothing
but she worked at her cooking and at the washing at the
pool even in the winter when the water was stiff with ice
to be broken. but wang lung never thought to say:

'well, and why do you not with the silver i have to
spare, hire a servant or

d, which wang lung mistook for health, so that he
said loudly, 'now she will be well yet!'

and the two young persons went up and bowed to her j
and she patted the bed and said: s

'sit here and drink the wine and eat the rice of your i
marriage, for i would see it all and this will be your bed j
of marriage since i am soon to be finished with it and
carried away.'

now none would answer her when she spoke thus but
the two sat down side by side, shy of each other and in
silence, and the wife of wang lung's uncle came in, fat
and important with the occasion, bearing two bowls of hot
wine, and the two drank separately, and then mingled the
wine of the two bowls and drank again, thus signifying that
the two were now one, and they ate rice and mingled the
rice and this signified that their life was now one, and thus
they were wed. then they bowed again to o-lan and to
wang lung and then they went out and together they
bowed to the assembled guests.

then the feasting began and the rooms and the courts

'well, and it is dearer than jade to have them at us
like this,' the young man argued, c and to endure besides i
their haughtiness and the young man peeping at my wife.' i

but wang lung would not at once consent, for it was
not so easy a thing to do, and would cost a good bag of
silver to do it.

it is doubtful whether the thing would ever have been
done and they would have gone as they were until the
waters chose to recede had not a thing happened.

this thing was that the son of wang lung's uncle. cast
his eyes upon the second daughter of wang lung, who
was his cousin and by blood the same as his sister. now
the second daughter of wang lung was an exceedingly 1
pretty girl, and she looked like the second son who was a
merchant, but with her smallness and lightness, and she
had not his yellow skin. her skin was fair and pale as al-
mond flowers and she had a little nose and thin red lips i
and her feet were small.

her cousin laid hold of her one night when she passed
alone through the c

the silver, it is weighed out in the -room behind this, an
ounce for a silver piece.'

then wang lung would not think further what he did,
but he said quickly:

'i will take six ounces of it.'

then after the second daughter was sent away
and wang lung was free of his anxiety about her, he said
to his uncle one day:

'since you are my father's brother, here is a little better
tobacco for you.'

and he opened the jar of opium and the stuff was sticky
and sweet smelling and wang lung's uncle took it and
smelled of it, and he laughed and was pleased and he said :

'well now, i have smoked it a little but not often before
this, for it is too dear, but i like it well enough.'

and wang lung answered him, pretending to be care-
less :

'it is only a little i bought once for my father when
he grew old and could not sleep at night and i found it
to-day unused and i thought: 'there is my father's brother,
and why should he not have it before me, who am younger
and do not need it yet?' tak

e it then, and smoke it when
you wish or when you have a little pain.'

then wang lung's uncle took it greedily, for it was
sweet to smell and a thing that only rich men used, and
he took it and bought a pipe and he smoked the opium,
lying all day upon his bed to do it. then wang lung
saw to it that there were pipes bought and left here and
there and he pretended to smoke himself, but he only took
a pipe to his room and left it there cold. and his two sons
in the house and lotus he would not allow to touch the
opium, saying as his excuse that it was too dear, but he
urged it upon his unc

 the winter of the fifth year it was very cold, more
cold than any winter for thirty years, so that for the first
time in wang lung's memory the moat froze about the
wall of the town and men could walk back and forth on
it. a continual icy wind blew also from the north-east
and there was nothing, no garment of goatskin or fur,
that could keep a man warm. in every room in the great
house they burned braziers of charcoal and still it was
cold enough to see a man's breath when he blew it out.

now wang lung's uncle and his wife had long since
smoked all the flesh off their bones and they lay day in
and day out on their beds like two old dry sticks, and: there
was no warmth in them. and wang lung heard his uncle
could not sit up even any more in his bed and he spat
blood whenever he moved at all, and he went out to see,
and he saw there were not many hours left for the old
man.

then wang lung bought two coffins of wood good
enough but not too good, and he had the coffins taken
into the room where his uncl
