[CHARACTER] 
brett is a strong, largely independent woman. she exerts
great power over the men around her, as her beauty and charisma
seem to charm everyone she meets. moreover, she refuses to commit
to any one man, preferring ultimate independence. however, her independence
does not make her happy. she frequently complains to jake about
how miserable she is--her life, she claims, is aimless and unsatisfying.
her wandering from relationship to relationship parallels jake and
his friends' wandering from bar to bar. although she will not commit
to any one man, she seems uncomfortable being by herself. as jake
remarks, "she can't go anywhere alone."
	indeed, there are several misogynist strains in hemingway's
representation of brett. for instance, she disrupts relationships between
men with her very presence. it seems that, in hemingway's view,
a liberated woman is necessarily a corrupting, dangerous force for
men. brett represents a threat to pedro romero and his career--she
believes that her own strength and independence will eventually spoil
romero's strength and independence. because she does not conform
to traditional feminine behavior, she is a danger to him.
	as with jake and his male friends, world war i seems
to have played an essential part in the formation of brett's character.
during the war, brett's true love died of dysentery. her subsequent
aimlessness, especially with regard to men, can be interpreted as
a futile, subconscious search for this original love. brett's personal
search is perhaps symbolic of the entire lost generation's search
for the shattered prewar values of love and romance.
