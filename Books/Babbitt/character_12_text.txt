teachers were chosen; and though he chanted "one of the boasts of zenith
is that we pay our teachers adequately," that was because he had read
the statement in the advocate-times. himself, he could not have given
the average salary of teachers in zenith or anywhere else.

he had heard it said that "conditions" in the county jail and the zenith
city prison were not very "scientific;" he had, with indignation at the
criticism of zenith, skimmed through a report in which the notorious
pessimist seneca doane, the radical lawyer, asserted that to throw
boys and young girls into a bull-pen crammed with men suffering from
syphilis, delirium tremens, and insanity was not the perfect way of
educating them. he had controverted the report by growling, "folks that
think a jail ought to be a bloomin' hotel thornleigh make me sick. if
people don't like a jail, let 'em behave 'emselves and keep out of it.
besides, these reform cranks always exaggerate." that was the beginning

at that moment seneca doane, the radical lawyer, and dr. kurt yavitch,
the histologist (whose report on the destruction of epithelial cells
under radium had made the name of zenith known in munich, prague, and
rome), were talking in doane's library.

"zenith's a city with gigantic power--gigantic buildings, gigantic
machines, gigantic transportation," meditated doane.

is one big railroad station--with all the people taking tickets for the

babbitt's excursion was never known to his family, nor to any one in
zenith save rogers and wing. it was not officially recognized even by
himself. if it had any consequences, they have not been discovered.




chapter xiv

this autumn a mr. w. g. harding, of marion, ohio, was appointed
president of the united states, but zenith was less interested in the
national campaign than in the local election. seneca doane, though he
was a lawyer and a graduate of the state university, was candidate for
mayor of zenith on an alarming labor ticket. to oppose him the democrats
and republicans united on lucas prout, a mattress-manufacturer with a
perfect record for sanity. mr. prout was supported by the banks, the
chamber of commerce, all the decent newspapers, and george f. babbitt.

babbitt was precinct-leader on floral heights, but his district was safe
and he longed for stouter battling. his convention paper had

he deserved his glory. he was an excellent campaigner. he had faith; he
was certain that if lincoln were alive, he would be electioneering for
mr. w. g. harding--unless he came to zenith and electioneered for
lucas prout. he did not confuse audiences by silly subtleties; prout
represented honest industry, seneca doane represented whining laziness,
and you could take your choice. with his broad shoulders and vigorous
voice, he was obviously a good fellow; and, rarest of all, he really
liked people. he almost liked common workmen. he wanted them to be well
paid, and able to afford high rents--though, naturally, they must
not interfere with the reasonable profits of stockholders. thus nobly
endowed, and keyed high by the discovery that he was a natural orator,
he was popular with audiences, and he raged through

poverty and of manual labor, has, even when fate condemned him to sit
at a desk, yet never forgotten how it feels, by heck, to be up at
five-thirty and at the factory with the ole dinner-pail in his hardened
mitt when the whistle blew at seven, unless the owner sneaked in ten
minutes on us and blew it early! (laughter.) to come down to the basic
and fundamental issues of this campaign, the great error, insincerely
promulgated by seneca doane--"

there were workmen who jeered--young cynical workmen, for the most part
foreigners, jews, swedes, irishmen, italians--but the older men, the
patient, bleached, stooped carpenters and mechanics, cheered him; and
when he worked up to his anecdote of lincoln their eyes were wet.

modestly, busily, he hurried out of the hall on delicious applause, and
sped off to his third audience of the evening. "ted, you better drive,"
he said. "kind of all in after that spiel. well, paul, how'd it go? did

mrs. babbitt reproved, "rone, i should think you could see and realize
that when your father's all worn out with orating, it's no time to
expect him to explain these complicated subjects. i'm sure when he's
rested he'll be glad to explain it to you. now let's all be quiet and
give papa a chance to get ready for his next speech. just think! right

mr. lucas prout and sound business defeated mr. seneca doane and class
rule, and zenith was again saved. babbitt was offered several minor
appointments to distribute among poor relations, but he preferred
advance information about the extension of paved highways, and this a
grateful administration gave to him. also, he was one of only nineteen
speakers at the dinner with which the chamber of commerce celebrated the
victory of righteousness.

his reputation for oratory established, at the dinner of the zenith real
estate board he made the annual address.

was what he longed to do but because it was all he could do. he scanned
again his discovery that he could never run away from zenith and family
and office, because in his own brain he bore the office and the family
and every street and disquiet and illusion of zenith.

"but i'm going to--oh, i'm going to start something!" he vowed, and he
tried to make it valiant.

as he walked through the train, looking for familiar faces, he saw only
one person whom he knew, and that was seneca doane, the lawyer who,
after the blessings of being in babbitt's own class at college and
of becoming a corporation-counsel, had turned crank, had headed
farmer-labor tickets and fraternized with admitted socialists. though he
was in rebellion, naturally babbitt did not care to be seen talking
with such a fanatic, but in all the pullmans he could find no other
acquaintance, and reluctantly he halted. seneca doane was a slight,
thin-haired man, rather like chum frink except that he hadn't frink's

inspired us all."

"well.... well.... i've always aimed to be liberal." babbitt was
enormously shy and proud and self-conscious; he tried to look like the
boy he had been a quarter-century ago, and he shone upon his old friend
seneca doane as he rumbled, "trouble with a lot of these fellows, even
the live wires and some of 'em that think they're forward-looking, is
they aren't broad-minded and liberal. now, i always believe in giving
the other fellow a chance, and listening to his ideas."

"that's fine."

"tell you how i figure it: a little opposition is good for all of us,

believe that he had ever been away. nor was it at all evident to his
acquaintances that there was a new george f. babbitt, save that he was
more irritable under the incessant chaffing at the athletic club, and
once, when vergil gunch observed that seneca doane ought to be hanged,
babbitt snorted, "oh, rats, he's not so bad."

at home he grunted "eh?" across the newspaper to his commentatory wife,
and was delighted by tinka's new red tam o'shanter, and announced, "no

"no, the engineering school hasn't got the standing the college has,"
fretted babbitt.

"i'd like to know how it hasn't! the engineers can play on any of the
teams!"

there was much explanation of the "dollars-and-cents value of being
known as a college man when you go into the law," and a truly oratorical
account of the lawyer's life. before he was through with it, babbitt had
ted a united states senator.

among the great lawyers whom he mentioned was seneca doane.

"but, gee whiz," ted marveled, "i thought you always said this doane was
a reg'lar nut!"

"that's no way to speak of a great man! doane's always been a good
friend of mine--fact i helped him in college--i started him out and you
might say inspired him. just because he's sympathetic with the aims of
labor, a lot of chumps that lack liberality and broad-mindedness think
he's a crank, but let me tell you there's mighty few of 'em that rake

a condensed-milk plant was set afire--each side charged it to the
other--and the city was hysterical.

and babbitt chose this time to be publicly liberal.

he belonged to the sound, sane, right-thinking wing, and at first he
agreed that the crooked agitators ought to be shot. he was sorry when
his friend, seneca doane, defended arrested strikers, and he thought of
going to doane and explaining about these agitators, but when he read a
broadside alleging that even on their former wages the telephone girls
had been hungry, he was troubled. "all lies and fake figures," he said,
but in a doubtful croak.

for the sunday after, the chatham road presbyterian church announced a
sermon by dr. john jennison drew on "how the saviour would end strikes."
babbitt had been negligent about church-going lately, but he went t

strikers filing from the park. many of them bore posters with "they
can't stop our peacefully walking." the militiamen tore away the
posters, but the strikers fell in behind their leaders and straggled
off, a thin unimpressive trickle between steel-glinting lines of
soldiers. babbitt saw with disappointment that there wasn't going to be
any violence, nothing interesting at all. then he gasped.

among the marchers, beside a bulky young workman, was seneca doane,
smiling, content. in front of him was professor brockbank, head of
the history department in the state university, an old man and
white-bearded, known to come from a distinguished massachusetts family.

"why, gosh," babbitt marveled, "a swell like him in with the strikers?
and good ole senny doane! they're fools to get mixed up with this bunch.
they're parlor socialists! but they have got nerve. and nothing in it
for them, not a cent! and--i don't know 's all the strikers look like

babbitt was vaguely frightened.

he saw a crowd listening to a man who was talking from the rostrum of a
kitchen-chair. he stopped his car. from newspaper pictures he knew that
the speaker must be the notorious freelance preacher, beecher ingram,
of whom seneca doane had spoken. ingram was a gaunt man with flamboyant
hair, weather-beaten cheeks, and worried eyes. he was pleading:

"--if those telephone girls can hold out, living on one meal a day,
doing their own washing, starving and smiling, you big hulking men ought
to be able--"

babbitt saw that from the sidewalk vergil gunch was watching him. in
vague disquiet he started the car and mechanically drove on, while
gunch's hostile eyes seemed to follow him all the way.

"there's a lot of these fellows

ey were not shocked by such
frank speaking. tanis ventured, "i know you'll understand--i mean--i
don't quite know how to say it, but i do think that girls who pretend
they're bad by the way they dress really never go any farther. they give
away the fact that they haven't the instincts of a womanly woman."

remembering ida putiak, the manicure girl, and how ill she had used him,
babbitt agreed with enthusiasm; remembering how ill all the world had
used him, he told of paul riesling, of zilla, of seneca doane, of the
strike:

"see how it was? course i was as anxious to have those beggars licked to
a standstill as anybody else, but gosh, no reason for not seeing their
side. for a fellow's own sake, he's got to be broad-minded and liberal,
don't you think so?"

"oh, i do!" sitting on the hard little couch, she clasped her hands
beside her, leaned toward him, absorbed him; and in a glorious state of
being appreciated he proclaimed:

"so i up and said to the fellows at the club, 'look here,' i--"

"oh, i know!" her voice caressed him; it cloaked him like warm silk.
"and i feel lonely, so lonely, some days, mr. babbitt."

"we're a sad pair of birds! but i think we're pretty darn nice!"

"yes, i think we're lots nicer than most people i know!" they smiled.
"but please tell me what you said at the club."

"well, it was like this: course seneca doane is a friend of mine--they
can say what they want to, they can call him anything they please, but
what most folks here don't know is that senny is the bosom pal of some
of the biggest statesmen in the world--lord wycombe, frinstance--you

that lord wycombe is one of the biggest guns in england--well, doak or

the assurance of tanis judique's friendship fortified babbitt's
self-approval. at the athletic club he became experimental. though
vergil gunch was silent, the others at the roughnecks' table came to
accept babbitt as having, for no visible reason, "turned crank." they
argued windily with him, and he was cocky, and enjoyed the spectacle
of his interesting martyrdom. he even praised seneca doane. professor
pumphrey said that was carrying a joke too far; but babbitt argued, "no!
fact! i tell you he's got one of the keenest intellects in the country.
why, lord wycombe said that--"

"oh, who the hell is lord wycombe? what you always lugging him in for?
you been touting him for the last six weeks!" protested orville jones.

nth-rater like fulton bemis could rebuke him. he perceived
that, since he was making love to every woman possible, tanis was no
longer his one pure star, and he wondered whether she had ever been
anything more to him than a woman. and if bemis had spoken to him, were
other people talking about him? he suspiciously watched the men at the
athletic club that noon. it seemed to him that they were uneasy. they
had been talking about him then? he was angry. he became belligerent.
he not only defended seneca doane but even made fun of the y. m. c. a,
vergil gunch was rather brief in his answers.

afterward babbitt was not angry. he was afraid. he did not go to the
next lunch of the boosters' club but hid in a cheap restaurant, and,
while he munched a ham-and-egg sandwich and sipped coffee from a cup on
the arm of his chair, he worried.

four days later, when the bunch were having one of their best parties,
babbitt drove them to the skating-rink which had been laid out on the
chaloosa river. after a thaw

shooting off their mouths so free. don't it sound like the organization
could do a great work? we've already got some of the strongest men in
town, and of course we want you in. how about it?"

babbitt was uncomfortable. he felt a compulsion back to all the
standards he had so vaguely yet so desperately been fleeing. he fumbled:

"i suppose you'd especially light on fellows like seneca doane and try
to make 'em--"

"you bet your sweet life we would! look here, old georgie: i've never
for one moment believed you meant it when you've defended doane, and the
strikers and so on, at the club. i knew you were simply kidding those
poor galoots like sid finkelstein.... at least i certainly hope you were
kidding!"

feeble he sounded, conscious of gunch's mature and relentless eye.

un to tanis. he had not
dared to hope for it, but she was in, and alone. only she wasn't tanis.
she was a courteous, brow-lifting, ice-armored woman who looked like
tanis. she said, "yes, george, what is it?" in even and uninterested
tones, and he crept away, whipped.

his first comfort was from ted and eunice littlefield.

they danced in one evening when ted was home from the university, and
ted chuckled, "what's this i hear from euny, dad? she says her dad says
you raised cain by boosting old seneca doane. hot dog! give 'em fits!
stir 'em up! this old burg is asleep!" eunice plumped down on babbitt's
lap, kissed him, nestled her bobbed hair against his chin, and crowed;
"i think you're lots nicer than howard. why is it," confidentially,
"that howard is such an old grouch? the man has a good heart, and
honestly, he's awfully bright, but he never will learn to step on the
gas, after all the training i've given him. don't you think we could do
something with him, dearest?"

she was out of the hospital in seventeen days. he went to see her each
afternoon, and in their long talks they drifted back to intimacy. once
he hinted something of his relations to tanis and the bunch, and she was
inflated by the view that a wicked woman had captivated her poor george.

if once he had doubted his neighbors and the supreme charm of the good
fellows, he was convinced now. you didn't, he noted, "see seneca doane
coming around with any flowers or dropping in to chat with the missus,"
but mrs. howard littlefield brought to the hospital her priceless wine
jelly (flavored with real wine); orville jones spent hours in picking
out the kind of novels mrs. babbitt liked--nice love stories about new
york millionaries and wyoming cowpunchers; louetta swanson knitted a
pink bed-jacket; sidney finkelstein and his merry brown-eyed flapper of
a wife selected the prettiest nightgown in all the stock of parcher and

the good citizens' league, old man? we have
some corking times together, and we need your advice."

then did babbitt, almost tearful with joy at being coaxed instead of
bullied, at being permitted to stop fighting, at being able to desert
without injuring his opinion of himself, cease utterly to be a domestic
revolutionist. he patted gunch's shoulder, and next day he became a
member of the good citizens' league.

within two weeks no one in the league was more violent regarding the
wickedness of seneca doane, the crimes of labor unions, the perils of
immigration, and the delights of golf, morality, and bank-accounts than
was george f. babbitt.




chapter xxxiv

the good citizens' league had spread through the country, but nowhere
was it so effective and well esteemed as in cities of the type of
zenith, commercial cities of a few hundred thousand inhabitants, most
of which--though not all--lay inland, against a background of
cornfields and mines and of small towns which depended upon them for
mo
