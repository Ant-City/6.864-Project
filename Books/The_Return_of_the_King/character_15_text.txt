 barred his way, and as he listened pippin became aware that he himself was being discussed.
â€˜yea truly, we know you, mithrandir,â€™ said the leader of the men, â€˜and you know the pass-words of the seven gates and are free to go forward. but we do not know your companion. what is he? a dwarf out of the mountains in the north? we wish for no strangers in the land at this time, unless they be mighty men of arms in whose faith and help we can trust.â€™
â€˜i will vouch for him before the seat of denethor,â€™ said gandalf. â€˜and as for valour, that cannot be computed by stature. he has passed through more battles and perils than you have, ingold, though you be twice his height; and he comes now from the storming of isengard, of which we bear tidings, and great weariness is on him, or i would wake him. his name is peregrin, a very valiant man.â€™
â€˜man?â€™ said ingold dubiously; and the others laughed.
â€˜man!â€™ cried pippin, now thoroughly roused. â€˜man! indeed not! i am a hobbit and no more

â€˜hobbit,â€™ said pippin. â€˜little service can i offer to your lord, but what i can do, i would do, remembering boromir the brave.â€™
â€˜fare you well!â€™ said ingold; and the men made way for shadow fax, and he passed through a narrow gate in the wall. â€˜may you bring good counsel to denethor in his need, and to us all, mithrandir!â€™ ingold cried. â€˜but you come with tidings of grief and danger, as is your wont, they say.â€™
â€˜because i come seldom but when my help is needed,â€™ answered gandalf. â€˜and as for counsel, to you i would say that you are over-late in repairing the wall of the pelennor. courage will now be your best defence against the storm that is at hand - that and such hope as i bring. for not all the tidings that i bring are evil. but leave your trowels and sharp

ught of crystals; and white banners broke and fluttered from the battlements in the morning breezeâ€™ and high and far he heard a clear ringing as of silver trumpets.
so gandalf and peregrin rode to the great gate of the men of gondor at the rising of the sun, and its iron doors rolled back before them.
â€˜mithrandir! mithrandir!â€™ men cried. â€˜now we know that the storm is indeed nigh!â€™
â€˜it is upon you,â€™ said gandalf. â€˜i have ridden on its wings. let me pass! i must come to your lord denethor, while his stewardship lasts. whatever betide, you have come to the end of the gondor that you have known. let me pass!â€™
then men fell back before the command of his voice and questioned him no further, though they gazed in wonder at the hobbit that sat before him and at the horse that bore him. for the people of the city used horses very little and they were seldom seen in their streets, save only those ridden by the errand-riders of their lord. and they said: â€˜surely that is one of the gr

 and one white tree.
the words that gandalf had murmured came back into his mind. and then he found himself at the doors of the great hall beneath the gleaming tower; and behind the wizard he passed the tall silent door-wardens and entered the cool echoing shadows of the house of stone.
they walked down a paved passage, long and empty, and as they went gandalf spoke softly to pippin. â€˜be careful of your words, master peregrin! this is no time for hobbit pertness. thÃ©oden is a kindly old man. denethor is of another sort, proud and subtle, a man of far greater lineage and power, though he is not called a king. but he will speak most to you, and question you much, since you can tell him of his son boromir. he loved him greatly: too much perhaps; and the more so because they were unlike. but under cover of this love he will think it easier to learn what he witches from you rather than from me. do not tell him more than you need, and leave quiet the matter of frodoâ€™s errand. i will deal with t

â€˜why not? what is wrong with strider?â€™ pippin whispered. â€˜he meant to come here, didnâ€™t he? and heâ€™ll be arriving soon himself anyway.â€™
â€˜maybe, maybe,â€™ said gandalf. â€˜though if he comes, it is likely to be in some way that no one expects, not even denethor. it will be better so. at least he should come unheralded by us.â€™
gandalf halted before a tall door of polished metal. â€˜see, master pippin, there is no time to instruct you now in the history of gondor; though it might have been better, if you had learned something of it, when you were still birds-nesting and playing truant in the woods of the shire. do as i bid! it is scarcely wise when bringing the news of the death of his heir to a mighty lord to speak over much of the coming of one who

 behind it was carved upon the wall and set with gems an image of a tree in flower. but the throne was empty. at the foot of the dais, upon the lowest step which was broad and deep, there was a stone chair, black and unadorned, and on it sat an old man gazing at his lap. in his hand was a white rod with a golden knob. he did not look up. solemnly they paced the long floor towards him, until they stood three paces from his footstool. then gandalf spoke.
â€˜hail, lord and steward of minas tirith, denethor son of ecthelion! i am come with counsel and tidings in this dark hour.â€™
then the old man looked up. pippin saw his carven face with its proud bones and skin like ivory, and the long curved nose between the dark deep eyes; and he was reminded not so much of boromir as of aragorn. â€˜dark indeed is the hour,â€™ said the old man, â€˜and at such times you are wont to come, mithrandir. but though all the signs forebode that the doom of gondor is drawing nigh, less now to me is that darkness than

â€˜it is,â€™ said gandalf. â€˜one of the twain. the other is with thÃ©oden of rohan and may come hereafter. halflings they are, as you see, yet this is not he of whom the omens spoke.â€™
â€˜yet a halfling still,â€™ said denethor grimly, â€˜and little love do i bear the name, since those accursed words came to trouble our counsels and drew away my son on the wild errand to his death. my boromir! now we have need of you. faramir should have gone in his stead.â€™
â€˜he would have gone,â€™ said gandalf. â€˜be not unjust in your grief! boromir claimed the errand and would not suffer any other to have it. he was a masterful man, and one to take what he desired. i journeyed far with him and learned much of his mood. but you s

â€˜i have received this,â€™ said denethor, and laying down his rod he lifted from his lap the thing that he had been gazing at. in each hand he held up one half of a great horn cloven through the middle: a wild-ox horn bound with silver.
â€˜that is the horn that boromir always wore!â€™ cried pippin.
â€˜verily,â€™ said denethor. â€˜and in my turn i bore it, and so did each eldest son of our house, far back into the vanished years before the failing of the kings, since vorondil father of mardil hunted the wild kine of araw in the far fields of rhÃ»n. i heard it blowing dim upon the northern marches thirteen days ago, and the river brought it to me, broken: it will wind no more.â€™ he paused and there was a heavy silence. suddenly he turned his black glance upon pippin. â€˜what say you to that, halfling?â€™
â€˜thirteen,

â€˜so,â€™ said denethor, looking keenly at pippinâ€™s face. â€˜you were there? tell me more! why did no help come? and how did you escape, and yet he did not, so mighty a man as he was, and only orcs to withstand him?â€™
pippin flushed and forgot his fear. â€˜the mightiest man may be slain by one arrow,â€™ he said; â€˜and boromir was pierced by many. when last i saw him he sank beside a tree and plucked a black-feathered shaft from his side. then i swooned and was made captive. i saw him no more, and know no more. but

then pippin looked the old man in the eye, for pride stirred strangely within him, still stung by the scorn and suspicion in that cold voice. â€˜little service, no doubt, will so great a lord of men think to find in a hobbit, a halfling from the northern shire; yet such as it is, i will offer it, in payment of my debt.â€™ twitching aside his grey cloak, pippin drew forth his small sword and laid it at denethorâ€™s feet.
a pale smile, like a gleam of cold sun on a winterâ€™s evening, passed over the old manâ€™s face; but he bent his head and held out his hand, laying the shards of the horn aside. â€˜give me the weapon!â€™ he said.
pippin lifted it and presented the hilt to him. â€˜whence came this?â€™ said denethor. â€˜many, many years lie on it. surely this is a blade wrought by our own kindred in the north in the deep past?â€™
â€˜it came out of the mounds that lie on the borders of my country â€˜ sa

â€˜i see that strange tales are woven about you,â€™ said denethor, â€˜and once again it is shown that looks may belie the man - or the halfling. i accept your service. for you are not daunted by words; and you have courteous speech, strange though the sound of it may be to us in the south. and we shall have need of all folk of courtesy, be they great or small, in the days to come. swear to me now!â€™
â€˜take the hilt,â€™ said gandalf, â€˜and speak after the lord, if you are resolved on this.â€™
â€˜i am,â€™ said pippin.
the old man laid the sword along his lap

, and pippin put his hand to the hilt, and said slowly after denethor:
â€˜here do i swear fealty and service to gondor, and to the lord and steward of the realm, to speak and to be silent, to do and to let be, to come and to go, in need or plenty, in peace or war, in living or dying, from this hour henceforth, until my lord release me, or death take me, or the world end. so say i, peregrin son of paladin of the shire of the halflings.â€™
and this do i hear, denethor son of ecthelion, lord of gondor, steward of the high king, and i will not forget it, nor fail to reward that which is given: fealty with love, valour with honour, oath-breaking with vengeance.â€™ then pippin received back his sword and put it in its sheath.
â€˜and now,â€™ said denethor, â€˜my first command to you: speak and be not silent! tell me your full tale, and see that you recall all that you can of boromir, my son. sit now and begin!â€™ as he spoke he struck a small silver gong that sto

od near his footstool, and at once servants came forward. pippin saw then that they had been standing in alcoves on either side of the door, unseen as he and gandalf entered.
â€˜bring wine and food and seats for the guests,â€™ said denethor, â€˜and see that none trouble us for one hour.â€™
â€˜it is all that i have to spare, for there is much else to heed,â€™ he said to gandalf. â€˜much of more import, it may seem, and yet to me less pressing. but maybe we can speak again at the end of the day.â€™
â€˜and earlier, it is to be hoped,â€™ said gandalf. â€˜for i have not ridden hither from isengard, one hundred and fifty leagues, with the speed of wind, only to bring you one small warrior, however courteous. is it naught to you that thÃ

â€˜it is much to me. but i know already sufficient of these deeds for my own counsel against the menace of the east.â€™ he turned his dark eyes on gandalf, and now pippin saw a likeness between the two, and he felt the strain between them, almost as if he saw a line of smouldering fire, drawn from eye to eye, that might suddenly burst into flame.
denethor looked indeed much more like a great wizard than gandalf did, more kingly, beautiful, and powerful; and older. yet by a sense other than sight pippin perceived that gandalf had the greater power and the deeper wisdom, and a majesty that was veiled. and he was older, far older. â€˜how much older?â€™ he wondered, and then he thought how odd it was that he had never thought about it before. treebeard had said something about wizards, but even then he had not thought of gandalf as one of them. what

 was gandalf? in what far time and place did he come into the world, and when would he leave it? and then his musings broke off, and he saw that denethor and gandalf still looked each other in the eye, as if reading the otherâ€™s mind. but it was denethor who first withdrew his gaze.
â€˜yea,â€™ he said; â€˜for though the stones be lost, they say, still the lords of gondor have keener sight than lesser men, and many messages come to them. but sit now!â€™
then men came bearing a chair and a low stool, and one brought a salver with a silver flagon and cups, and white cakes. pippin sat down, but he could not take his eyes from the old lord. was it so, or had he only imagined it, that as he spoke of the stones a sudden gleam of his eye had glanced up

on pippinâ€™s face?
â€˜now tell me your tale, my liege,â€™ said denethor, half kindly; half mockingly. â€˜for the words of one whom my son so befriended will be welcome indeed.â€™
pippin never forgot that hour in the great hall under the piercing eye of the lord of gondor, stabbed ever and anon by his shrewd questions, and all the while conscious of gandalf at his side, watching and listening, and (so pippin felt) holding in check a rising wrath and impatience. when the hour was over and denethor again rang the gong, pippin felt worn out. â€˜it cannot be more than nine oâ€™clock,â€™ he thought. â€˜i could now eat three breakfasts on end.â€™
â€˜lead the lord mithrandir to the housing prepared for him,â€™ said denethor, â€˜and his companion may lodge with him for the present, if he will. but be it known that i have now sworn him to my service, and he shall be known as peregrin son of paladin and taught the lesser pass-words. send word to the captains that they shall wait on me here, as so

â€˜folly?â€™ said gandalf. â€˜nay, my lord, when you are a dotard you will die. you can use even your grief as a cloak. do you think that i do not understand your purpose in questioning for an hour one who knows the least, while i sit by?â€™
â€˜if you understand it, then be content,â€™ returned denethor. â€˜pride would be folly that disdained help and counsel at need; but you deal out such gifts according to your own designs. yet the lord of gondor is not to be made the tool of other menâ€™s purposes, however worthy. and to him there is no purpose higher in the world as it now stands than the good of gondor; and the rule of gondor, my lord, is mine and no other manâ€™s, unless the king should come again.â€™
â€˜unless the king should come again?â€™ said gandalf. â€˜well, my lord steward, it is

ndeed you did your best,â€™ said the wizard; â€˜and i hope that it may be long before you find yourself in such a tight corner again between two such terrible old men. still the lord of gondor learned more from you than you may have guessed, pippin. you could not hide the fact that boromir did not lead the company from moria, and that there was one among you of high honour who was coming to minas tirith; and that he had a famous sword. men think much about the stories of old days in gondor; and denethor has given long thought to the rhyme and to the words isildurâ€™s bane, since boromir went away.
â€˜he is not as other men of this time, pippin, and whatever be his descent from father to son, by some chance the blood of westernesse runs nearly true in him; as it does in his other son, faramir, and yet did not in boromir whom he loved best. he has long sight. he can perceive, if he bends his will thither, much of what is passing in the minds of men, even of those that dwell far off. it is diffic

he fell silent and sighed. â€˜well, no need to brood on what tomorrow may bring. for one thing, tomorrow will be certain to bring worse than today, for many days to come. and there is nothing more that i can do to help it. the board is set, and the pieces are moving. one piece that i greatly desire to find is faramir, now the heir of denethor. i do not think that he is in the city; but i have had no time to gather news. i must go. pippin. i must go to this lordsâ€™ council and learn what i can. but the enemy has the move, and he is about to open his full game. and pawns are likely to see as much of it as any, peregrin son of paladin, soldier of gondor. sharpen your blade!â€™
gandalf went to the door, and there he turned. â€˜i am in haste pippin,â€™ he said. â€˜do me a favour when you go out. even before you rest, if you are not too

pippin found that shadowfax had been well housed and tended. for in the sixth circle, outside the walls of the citadel, there were some fair stables where a few swift horses were kept, hard by the lodgings of the errand-riders of the lord: messengers always ready to go at the urgent command of denethor or his chief captains. but now all the horses and the riders were out and away.
shadowfax whinnied as pippin entered the stable and turned his head. â€˜good morning!â€™ said pippin. â€˜gandalf will come as soon as he may. he is busy, but he sends greetings, and i am to see that all is well with you; and you resting, i hope, after your long labours.â€™
shadowfax tossed his head and stamped. but he allowed beregond to handle his head gently and stroke his great flanks.

pin gazed anxiously eastward, as if at any moment he might see thousands of orcs pouring over the fields. â€˜what can i see there?â€™ he asked, pointing down to the middle of the great curve of the anduin. â€˜is that another city, or what is it?â€™
â€˜it was a city,â€™ said beregond, â€˜the chief city of gondor, of which this was only a fortress. for that is the ruin of osgiliath on either side of anduin, which our enemies took and burned long ago. yet we won it back in the days of the youth of denethor: not to dwell in, but to hold as an outpost, and to rebuild the bridge for the passage of our arms. and then came the fell riders out of minas morgul.â€™
â€˜the black riders?â€™ said pippin, opening his eyes, and they were wide and dark with an old fear re-awakened.
â€˜yes, they were black,â€™ said beregond, â€˜and i see that you know something of them, though you have not spoken of them in any of your tales.â€™

â€˜but why were the beacons lit last night?â€™
â€˜it is over-late to send for aid when you are already besieged,â€™ answered beregond. â€˜but i do not know the counsel of the lord and his captains. they have many ways of gathering news. and the lord denethor is unlike other men: he sees far. some say that as he sits alone in his high chamber in the tower at night, and bends his thought this way and that, he can read somewhat of the future; and that he will at times search even the mind of the enemy, wrestling with him. and so it is that he is old, worn before his time. but however that may be, my lord faramir is abroad, beyond the river on some perilous errand, and he may have sent tidings.

though pippin had regretfully to destroy this hopeful tale, he could not be rid of his new rank, only fitting, men thought, to one befriended by boromir and honoured by the lord denethor; and they thanked him for coming among them, and hung on his words and stories of the outlands, and gave him as much food and ale as he could wish. indeed his only trouble was to be â€˜waryâ€™ according to the counsel of gandalf, and not to let his tongue wag freely after the manner of a hobbit among friends.
at length beregond rose. â€˜farewell for this time!â€™ he said. â€˜i have duty now till sundown, as have all the others here, i think. but if you are lonely, as you say, maybe you would li

 after the meal pippin stayed a while, and then took his leave, for a strange gloom was on him, and now he desired very much to see gandalf again.
â€˜can you find your way?â€™ said beregond at the door of the small hall, on the north side of the citadel, where they had sat. â€˜it is a black night, and all the blacker since orders came that lights are to be dimmed within the city, and none are to shine out from the walls. and i can give you news of another order: you will be summoned to the lord denethor early tomorrow. i fear you will not be for the third company. still we may hope to meet again. farewell and sleep in peace!â€™
the lodging was dark, save for a little lantern set on the table. gandalf was not there. gloom settled still more heavily on pippin. he climbed on the bench and tried to peer out of a window, but it was like looking into a pool of ink. he got down and closed the shutter and went to bed. for a while he lay and listened for sounds of gandalfâ€™s return, and then he fell i

â€˜but the night will be too short,â€™ said gandalf. â€˜i have come back here, for i must have a little peace, alone. you should sleep, in a bed while you still may. at the sunrise i shall take you to the lord denethor again. no, when the summons comes, not at sunrise. the darkness has begun. there will be no dawn.â€™

chapter 2

the passing of the grey company

gandalf was gone, and the thudding hoofs of shadowfax were lost in the night, when merry came back to aragorn. he had only a light bundle, for he had lost his pack at parth galen, and all he had was a few useful things he had picked up among the wreckage of isengard. hasufel was already saddled. legolas and gimli with their horse stood close by.

 the man was a stranger, though as like to boromir as if he were one of his kin, tall and grey-eyed and proud. he was clad as a rider with a cloak of dark green over a coat of fine mail; on the front of his helm was wrought a small silver star. in his hand he bore a single arrow, black-feathered and barbed with steel, but the point was painted red.
he sank on one knee and presented the arrow to thÃ©oden. â€˜hail lord of the rohirrim, friend of gondor!â€™ he said. â€˜hirgon i am, errand-rider of denethor, who bring you this token of war. gondor is in great need. often the rohirrim have aided us, but now the lord denethor asks for all your strength and all your speed; lest gondor fall at last.â€™
â€˜the red arrow!â€™ said thÃ©oden, holding it, as one who receives a summons long expected and yet dreadful when it comes. his hand trembled. â€˜the red arrow has not been seen in the mark in all my years! has it indeed come to that? and what does the lord denethor reckon that all my strength and all m

â€˜that is best known to yourself, lord,â€™ said hirgon. â€˜but ere long it may well come to pass that minas tirith is surrounded, and unless you have the strength to break a siege of many powers, the lord denethor bids me say that he judges that the strong arms of the rohirrim would be better within his walls than without.â€™
â€˜but he knows that we are a people who fight rather upon horseback and in the open, and that we are also a scattered people and time is needed for the gathering of our riders. is it not true, hirgon, that the lord of minas tirith knows more than he sets in his message? for we are already at war, as you may have seen, and you do not find us all unprepared. gandalf the grey has been

â€˜what the lord denethor may know or guess of all these things i cannot say,â€™ answered hirgon. â€˜but indeed our case is desperate. my lord does not issue any command to you, he begs you only to remember old friendship and oaths long spoken, and for your own good to do all that you may. it is reported to us that many kings have ridden in from the east to the service of mordor. from the north to the field of dagorlad there is skirmish and rumour of war. in the south the haradrim are moving, and fear has fallen on all

â€˜dark tidings,â€™ said thÃ©oden, â€˜yet not all unguessed. but say to denethor that even if rohan itself felt no peril, still we would come to his aid. but we have suffered much loss in our battles with saruman the traitor, and we must still think of our frontier to the north and east, as his own tidings make clear. so great a power as the dark lord seems now to wield might well contain us in battle before the city and yet strike with great force across the river away beyond the gate of kings.

â€˜as for that, who can tell?â€™ answered merry. â€˜but why, lord, did you receive me as sword-thain, if not to stay by your side? and i would not have it said of me in song only that i was always left behind!â€™
â€˜i received you for your safe-keeping,â€™ answered thÃ©oden; â€˜and also to do as i might bid. none of my riders can bear you as burden. if the battle were before my gates, maybe your deeds would be remembered by the minstrels; but it is a hundred leagues and two to mundburg where denethor is lord. i will say no more.â€™
merry bowed and went away unhappily, and stared at the lines of horsemen. already the companies were preparing to start: men were tightening girths, looking to saddles, caressing their horses; some gazed uneasily at the lowering sky. unnoticed a rider came up and spoke softly in the hobbitâ€™s ear.
â€˜where will wants not, a way opens, so we say,â€™ he whispered; â€˜and so i have found myself.â€™ merry looked up and saw that it was the young rider whom he had not

pippin looked ruefully at the small loaf and (he thought) very inadequate pat of butter which was set out for him, beside a cup of thin milk. â€˜why did you bring me here?â€™ he said.
â€˜you know quite well,â€™ said gandalf. â€˜to keep you out of mischief; and if you do not like being here, you can remember that you brought it on yourself.â€™ pippin said no more.
before long he was walking with gandalf once more down the cold corridor to the door of the tower hall. there denethor sat in a grey gloom, like an old patient spider, pippin thought: he did not seem to have moved since the day before. he beckoned gandalf to a seat, but pippin was left for a while standing unheeded. presently the old man turned to him:
â€˜well, master peregrin, i hope that you used yesterday to your profit, and to your liking? though i fear that the board is barer in this city than you could wish.â€™

â€˜i will, when i learn what you are fit for,â€™ said denethor. â€˜but that i shall learn soonest, maybe, if i keep you beside me. the esquire of my chamber has begged leave to go to the out-garrison, so you shall take his place for a while. you shall wait on me, bear errands, and talk to me, if war and council leave me any leisure. can you sing?â€™
â€˜yes,â€™ said pippin. â€˜well, yes, well enough for my own people. but we have no songs fit for great halls and evil times, lord. we seldom sing of anything more terrible than wind or rain. and most of my son

r such hours as these? we who have lived long under the shadow may surely listen to echoes from a land untroubled by it? then we may feel that our vigil was not fruitless, though it may have been thankless.â€™
pippinâ€™s heart sank. he did not relish the idea of singing any song of the shire to the lord of minas tirith, certainly not the comic ones that he knew best; they were too, well, rustic for such an occasion. he was however spared the ordeal for the present. he was not commanded to sing. denethor turned to gandalf, asking questions about the rohirrim and their policies, and the position of Ã©omer, the kingâ€™s nephew. pippin marvelled at the amount that the lord seemed to know about a people that lived far away, though it must, he thought, be many years since denethor himself had ridden abroad.
presently denethor waved to pippin and dismissed him again for a while. â€˜go to the armouries of the citadel,â€™ he said, â€˜and get you there the livery and gear of the tower. it will be ready.

€™ he said. â€˜he came with me. but let us not tarry here. there is much to say and to do, and you are weary. he shall come with us. indeed he must, for if he does not forget his new duties more easily than i do, he must attend on his lord again within this hour. come, pippin, follow us!â€™
so at length they came to the private chamber of the lord of the city. there deep seats were set about a brazier of charcoal; and wine was brought; and there pippin, hardly noticed, stood behind the chair of denethor and felt his weariness little, so eagerly did he listen to all that was said.
when faramir had taken white bread and drunk a draught of wine, he sat upon a low chair at his fatherâ€™s left hand. removed a little upon the other side sat gandalf in a chair of carven wood; and he seemed at first to be asleep. for at the beginning faramir spoke only of the errand upon which he had been sent out ten days before, and he brought tidings of ithilien and of movements of the enemy and his allies; and he

tain reporting to his master such matters as had often been heard before, small things of border-war that now seemed useless and petty, shorn of their renown.
then suddenly faramir looked at pippin. â€˜but now we come to strange matters,â€™ he said. â€˜for this is not the first halfling that i have seen walking out of northern legends into the southlands.â€™
at that gandalf sat up and gripped the arms of his chair; but he said nothing, and with a look stopped the exclamation on pippinâ€™s lips. denethor looked at their faces and nodded his head, as though in sign that he had read much there before it was spoken. slowly, while the others sat silent and still, faramir told his tale, with his eyes for the most part on gandalf, though now and again his glance strayed to pippin, as if to refresh his memory of others that he had seen.
as his story was unfolded of his meeting with frodo and his servant and of the events at henneth annÃ»n, pippin became aware that gandalfâ€™s hands were trembling as t

 leagues as a bird flies,â€™ answered faramir. â€˜but i could not come more swiftly. yestereve i lay at cair andros, the long isle in the river northward which we hold in defence; and horses are kept on the hither bank. as the dark drew on i knew that haste was needed, so i rode thence with three others that could also be horsed. the rest of my company i sent south to strengthen the garrison at the fords of osgiliath. i hope that i have not done ill?â€™ he looked at his father.
â€˜ill?â€™ cried denethor, and his eyes flashed suddenly. â€˜why do you ask? the men were under your command. or do you ask for my judgement on all your deeds? your bearing is lowly in my presence, yet it is long now since you turned from your own way at my counsel. see, you have spoken skilfully, as ever; but i, have i not seen your eye fixed on mithrandir, seeking whether you said well or too much? he has long had your heart in his keeping.

â€˜if what i have done displeases you, my father,â€™ said faramir quietly, â€˜i wish i had known your counsel before the burden of so weighty a judgement was thrust on me.â€™
â€˜would that have availed to change your judgement?â€™ said denethor. â€˜you would still have done just so, i deem. i know you well. ever your desire is to appear lordly and generous as a king of old, gracious, gentle. that may well befit one of high race, if he sits in power and peace. but in desperate hours gentleness may be repaid with death.â€™
â€˜so be it,â€™ said faramir.
â€˜so be it!â€™ cried denethor. â€˜but not with your death only, lord faramir: with the death also of your father, and of all your people, whom it is your part to protect now that boromir

â€˜do you wish then,â€™ said faramir, â€˜that our places had been exchanged?â€™
â€˜yes, i wish that indeed,â€™ said denethor. â€˜for boromir was loyal to me and no wizardâ€™s pupil. he would have remembered his fatherâ€™s need, and would not have squandered what fortune gave. he would have brought me a mighty gift.â€™
for a moment faramirâ€™s restraint gave way. â€˜i would ask you, my father, to remember why it was that i, not he, was in ithilien. on one occasion at least your counsel has prevailed, not long ago. it was the lord of the city that gave the errand to him.â€™
â€˜stir not the bitterness in the cup that i

â€˜comfort yourself!â€™ said gandalf. â€˜in no case would boromir have brought it to you. he is dead, and died well; may he sleep in peace! yet you deceive yourself. he would have stretched out his hand to this thing, and taking it he would have fallen. he would have kept it for his own, and when he returned you

the face of denethor set hard and cold. â€˜you found boromir less apt to your hand, did you not?â€™ he said softly. â€˜but i who was his father say that he would have brought it to me. you are wise, maybe, mithrandir, yet with all your subtleties you have not all wisdom. counsels may be found that are neither the webs of wizards nor the haste of fools. i have in this matter more lore and wisdom than you deem. â€˜
â€˜what then is your wisdom?â€™ said gandalf.
â€˜enough to perceive that there are two follies to avoid

. to use this thing is perilous. at this hour, to send it in the hands of a witless halfling into the land of the enemy himself, as you have done, and this son of mine, that is madness.â€™
â€˜and the lord denethor what would he have done?â€™
â€˜neither. but most surely not for any argument would he have set this thing at a hazard beyond all but a foolâ€™s hope, risking our utter ruin, if the enemy should recover what he lost. nay, it should have been kept, hidden, hidden dark and deep. not used, i say, unless at the uttermost end of need, but set beyond his grasp, save by a victory so final that what then befell would not trouble us, being dead.â€™
â€˜you think, as is your wont, my lord, of gondor only,â
 
 ___________________________
 
€™ said gandalf. â€˜yet there are other men and other lives, and time still to be. and for me, i pity even his slaves.â€™
â€˜and where will other men look for help, if gondor falls?â€™ answered denethor. â€˜if i had this thing now in the deep vaults of this citadel, we should not then shake with dread under this gloom, fearing the worst, and our counsels would be undisturbed. if you do not trust me to endure the test, you do not know me yet.â€™
â€˜nonetheless i do not trust you,â€™ said gandalf. â€˜had i done so, i could have sent this thing hither to your keeping and spared myself and others much anguish. and now hearing you speak i trust you less, no more than boromir. nay, stay your wrath! 
 
 ___________________________
 
i do not trust myself in this, and i refused this thing, even as a freely given gift. you are strong and can still in some matters govern yourself, denethor; yet if you had received this thing, it would have overthrown you. were it buried beneath the roots of mindolluin, still it would burn your mind away, as the darkness grows, and the yet worse things follow that soon shall come upon us.â€™
for a moment the eyes of denethor glowed again as he faced gandalf, and pippin felt once more the strain between their wills; but now almost it seemed as if their glances were like blades from eye to eye, flickering as they fenced. pippin trembled fearing some dreadful stroke. but suddenly denethor relaxed and grew cold again. he shrugged his shoulders.
â€˜if i had! if you had!â€™ he said. â€˜such words and ifs are vain. it has gone into the shadow, and only time will show what doom awaits it and us. the time will not be long.

in what is left, let all who fight the enemy in their fashion be at one, and keep hope while they may, and after hope still the hardihood to die free.â€™ he turned to faramir. â€˜what think you of the garrison at osgiliath?â€™
â€˜it is not strong,â€™ said faramir. â€˜i have sent the company of ithilien to strengthen it, as i have said.â€™
â€˜not enough, i deem,â€™ said denethor. â€˜it is there that the first blow will fall. they will have need of some stout captain there.â€™
â€˜there and elsewhere in many places,â€™ said faramir, and sighed. â€˜alas for my brother, whom i too loved!â€™ he rose. â€˜may i have your leave, father?â€™ and then he swayed and leaned upon his fatherâ€™s chair.
â€˜you are weary, i see,â€™ said denethor. â€˜you have ridden fast and far, and under shadows of evil in the air, i am told.â€™
â€˜let us not speak of that!â€™ said faramir.
â€˜then we

 will not,â€™ said denethor. â€˜go now and rest as you may. tomorrowâ€™s need will be sterner.â€™
all now took leave of the lord of the city and went to rest while they still could. outside there was a starless blackness as gandalf with pippin beside him bearing a small torch, made his way to their lodging. they did not speak until they were behind closed doors. then at last pippin took gandalfâ€™s hand.
â€˜tell me,â€™ he said, â€˜is there any hope? for frodo, i mean; or at least mostly for frodo.â€™
gandalf put his hand

sking: â€˜where are the riders of rohan?â€™
in truth faramir did not go by his own choosing. but the lord of the city was master of his council, and he was in no mood that day to bow to others. early in the morning the council had been summoned. there all the captains judged that because of the threat in the south their force was too weak to make any stroke of war on their own part, unless perchance the riders of rohan yet should come. meanwhile they must man the walls and wait.
â€˜yet,â€™ said denethor, â€˜we should not lightly abandon the outer defences, the rammas made with so great a labour. and the enemy must pay dearly for the crossing of the river. that he cannot do, in force to assail the city, either north of cair andros because of the marshes, or southwards towards lebennin because of the breadth of the river, that needs many boats. it is at osgiliath that he will put his weight, as before when boromir denied him the passage.â€™
â€˜that was but a trial,â€™ said faramir. â€˜today we m

we to lose a company. and the retreat of those that we put out far afield will be perilous, if he wins across in force.â€™
â€˜and what of cair andros?â€™ said the prince. â€˜that, too, must be held, if osgiliath is defended. let us not forget the danger on our left. the rohirrim may come, and they may not. but faramir has told us of great strength drawing ever to the black gate. more than one host may issue from it, and strike for more than one passage.â€™
â€˜much must be risked in war,â€™ said denethor. â€˜cair andros is manned and no more can be sent so far. but i will not yield the river and the pelennor unfought - not if there is a captain here who has still the courage to do his lordâ€™s will.â€™
then all were silent, but at length faramir said: â€˜i do not oppose your will, sire. since you are robbed of boromir, i will go and do what i can in his stead - if you command it.â€™
â€˜i do so,â€™ said denethor.
â€˜then farewell!â€™ said faramir. â€˜but if i should return, think better of me!â€

â€˜that depends on the manner of your return,â€™ said denethor.
gandalf it was that last spoke to faramir ere he rode east. â€˜do not throw your live away rashly or in bitterness,â€™ he said. â€˜you will be needed here, for other things than war. your father loves you, faramir, and will remember it ere the end. farewell!â€™
so now the lord faramir had gone forth again, and had taken with him such strength of men as were willing to go or could be spared. on the walls some gazed through the gloom towards the ruined city, and they wondered what chanced there,

slowly through the heavy air dull rumbles could be heard.
â€˜they have taken the wall!â€™ men cried. â€˜they are blasting breaches in it. they are coming!â€™
â€˜where is faramir?â€™ cried beregond in dismay. â€˜say not that he has fallen!â€™
it was gandalf that brought the first tidings. with a handful of horsemen he came in the middle morning, riding as escort to a line of wains. they were filled with wounded men, all that could be saved from the wreck of the causeway forts. at once he went to denethor. the lord of the city sat now in a high chamber above the hall of the white tower with pippin at his side; and through the dim windows, north and south and east, he bent his dark eyes, as if to pierce the shadows of doom that ringed him round. most to the north he looked, and would pause at whiles to listen as if by some ancient art his ears might hear the thunder of hoofs on the plains far away.
â€˜is faramir come?â€™ he asked.
â€˜no,â€™ said gandalf. â€˜but he still lived when i left him. yet

â€˜not - the dark lord?â€™ cried pippin, forgetting his place in his terror.
denethor laughed bitterly. â€˜nay, not yet, master peregrin! he will not come save only to triumph over me when all is won. he uses others as his weapons. so do all great lords, if they are wise, master halfling. or why should i sit here in my tower and think, and watch, and wait, spending even my sons? for i can still wield a brand.â€™
he stood up and cast open his long black cloak, and behold! he was clad in mail beneath, and girt with a long sword, great-hilted in a sheath of black and silver. â€˜thu

â€˜yet now under the lord of barad-dÃ»r the most fell of all his captains is already master of your outer walls,â€™ said gandalf. â€˜king of angmar long ago, sorcerer, ringwraith, lord of the nazgÃ»l, a spear of terror in the hand of sauron, shadow of despair.â€™
â€˜then, mithrandir, you had a foe to match you,â€™ said denethor. â€˜for myself, i have long known who is the chief captain of the hosts of the dark tower. is this all that you have returned to say? or can it be that you have withdrawn because you are overmatched?â€™
pippin trembled, fearing that gandalf would be stung to sudden wrath, but his fear was needless. â€˜it might be so,â€™ gandalf answered softly. â€˜but our trial of strength is not yet come. and if words spoken of old be true, not by the hand of man shall he fall, and hidden from the wise is the

â€˜and we also have few. now would the coming of rohan be in the nick of time,â€™ said denethor.
â€˜we are likely to see other newcomers first,â€™ said gandalf. â€˜fugitives from cair andros have already reached us. the isle has fallen. another army is come from the black gate, crossing from the north-east.â€™
â€˜some have accused you, mithrandir, of delighting to bear ill news,â€™ said denethor, â€˜but to me this is no longer news: it was known to mw ere nightfall yesterday. as for the sortie, i had already given thought to it. let us go down.â€™

nes of fire became flowing torrents, file upon file of orcs bearing flames, and wild southron men with red banners, shouting with harsh tongues, surging up, overtaking the retreat. and with a piercing cry out of the dim sky fell the winged shadows, the nazgÃ»l stooping to the kill.
the retreat became a rout. already men were breaking away, flying wild and witless here and there, flinging away their weapons, crying out in fear, falling to the ground.
and then a trumpet rang from the citadel, and denethor at last released the sortie. drawn up within the shadow of the gate and under the looming walls outside they had waited for his signal: all the mounted men that were left in the city. now they sprang forward, formed, quickened to a gallop, and charged with a great shout. and from the walls an answering shout went up; for foremost on the field rode the swan-knights of dol amroth with their prince and his blue banner at their head.
â€˜amroth for gondor!â€™ they cried. â€˜amroth to faramir!â€™

gÃ»l screeched and swept away, for their captain was not yet come to challenge the white fire of his foe. the hosts of morgul intent on their prey, taken at unawares in wild career, broke, scattering like sparks in a gale. the out-companies with a great cheer turned and smote their pursuers. hunters became the hunted. the retreat became an onslaught. the field was strewn with stricken orcs and men, and a reek arose of torches cast away, sputtering out in swirling smoke. the cavalry rode on.
but denethor did not permit them to go far. though the enemy was checked, and for the moment driven back, great forces were flowing in from the east. again the trumpet rang, sounding the retreat. the cavalry of gondor halted. behind their screen the out-companies re-formed. now steadily they came marching back. they reached the gate of the city and entered, stepping proudly: and proudly the people of the city looked on them and cried their praise, and yet they were troubled in heart. for the companies were

grievously reduced. faramir had lost a third of his men. and where was he?
last of all he came. his men passed in. the mounted knights returned, and at their rear the banner of dol amroth, and the prince. and in his arms before him on his horse he bore the body of his kinsman, faramir son of denethor, found upon the stricken field.
â€˜faramir! faramir!â€™ men cried, weeping in the streets. but he did not answer, and they bore him away up the winding road to the citadel and his father. even as the nazgÃ»l had swerved aside from the onset of the white rider, there came flying a deadly dart, and faramir, as he held at bay a mounted champion of harad, had fallen to the earth. only the charge of dol amroth had saved him from the red southland swords that would have hewed him as he lay.

in a desperate fever; dying someone said, and soon â€˜dyingâ€™ all men were saying upon the walls and in the streets. and by him his father sat, and said nothing, but watched, and gave no longer any heed to the defence.
no hours so dark had pippin known, not even in the clutches of the uruk-hai. it was his duty to wait upon the lord, and wait he did, forgotten it seemed, standing by the door of the unlit chamber, mastering his own fears as best he could. and as he watched, it seemed to him that denethor grew old before his eyes, as if something had snapped in his proud will, and his stern mind was overthrown. grief maybe had wrought it, and remorse. he saw tears on that once tearless face, more unbearable than wrath.
â€˜do not weep, lord,â€™ he stammered. â€˜perhaps he will get well. have you asked gandalf?â€™
â€˜comfort me not with wizards!â€™ said denethor. â€˜the foolâ€™s hope has failed. the enemy has found it, and now his power waxes; he sees our very thoughts, and all we do is ruinous.

 of bowmen on the wall. but indeed there were too few now left there to do them great damage, though the light of the fires showed up many a mark for archers of such skill as gondor once had boasted. then perceiving that the valour of the city was already beaten down, the hidden captain put forth his strength. slowly the great siege-towers built in osgiliath rolled forward through the dark.
messengers came again to the chamber in the white tower, and pippin let them enter, for they were urgent. denethor turned his head slowly from faramirâ€™s face, and looked at them silently.
â€˜the first circle of the city is burning, lord,â€™ they said. â€˜what are your commands? you are still the lord and steward. not all will follow mithrandir. men are flying from the walls and leaving them unmanned.â€™
â€˜why? why do the fools fly?â€™ said denethor. â€˜better to burn sooner than late, for burn we must. go back to your bonfire! and i? i will go now to my pyre. to my pyre! no tomb for denethor and faramir.
 
 ___________________________
 
 no tomb! no long slow sleep of death embalmed. we will burn like heathen kings before ever a ship sailed hither from the west. the west has failed. go back and burn!â€™
the messengers without bow or answer turned and fled.
now denethor stood up and released the fevered hand of faramir that he had held. â€˜he is burning, already burning,â€™ he said sadly. â€˜the house of his spirit crumbles.â€™ then stepping softly towards pippin he looked down at him.
â€˜farewell!â€™ he said. â€˜farewell, peregrin son of paladin! your service has been short, and now it is drawing to an end. i release you from the little that remains. go now, and die in what way seems best to you. and with whom you will, even that friend whose folly brought yo

denly hobbit-like once more, he stood up and looked the old man in the eyes. â€˜i will take your leave, sir,â€™ he said; â€˜for i want to see gandalf very much indeed. but he is no fool; and i will not think of dying until he despairs of life. but from my word and your service i do not wish to be released while you live. and if they come at last to the citadel, i hope to be here and stand beside you and earn perhaps the arms that you have given me.â€™
â€˜do as you will, master halfling,â€™ said denethor. â€˜but my life is broken. send for my servants!â€™ he turned back to faramir.
pippin left him and called for the servants, and they came: six men of the household, strong and fair; yet they trembled at the summons. but in a quiet voice denethor bade them lay warm coverlets on faramirâ€™s bed and take it up. and they did so, and lifting up the bed they bore it from the chamber. slowly they paced to trouble the fevered man as little as might be, and denethor, now bending on a staff, followed the

out from the white tower they walked, as if to a funeral, out into the darkness, where the overhanging cloud was lit beneath with flickers of dull red. softly they paced the great courtyard, and at a word from denethor halted beside the withered tree.
all was silent, save for the rumour of war in the city down below, and they heard the water dripping sadly from the dead branches into the dark pool. then they went on through the citadel gate, where the sentinel stared at them in wonder and dismay as they passed by. turning westward they came at length to a door in the rearward wall of the sixth circle. fen hollen it was called, for it was kept ever shut save at times of funeral, and only the lord of the city m

 images of men long dead; and they entered into the house of the stewards and set down their burden.
there pippin, staring uneasily about him, saw that he was in a wide vaulted chamber, draped as it were with the great shadows that the little lantern threw upon its shrouded walls. and dimly to be seen were many rows of tables, carved of marble; and upon each table lay a sleeping form, hands folded, head pillowed upon stone. but one table near at hand stood broad and bare. upon it at a sign from denethor they laid faramir and his father side by side, and covered them with one covering, and stood then with bowed heads as mourners beside a bed of death. then denethor spoke in a low voice.
â€˜here we will wait,â€™ he said. â€˜but send not for the embalmers. bring us wood quick to burn, and lay it all about us, and beneath; and pour oil upon it. and when i bid you thrust in a torch. do this and speak no more to me. farewell!â€™

at the door he turned to one of the servants who had remained on guard there. â€˜your master is not himself,â€™ he said. â€˜go slow! bring no fire to this place while faramir lives! do nothing until gandalf comes!â€™
â€˜who is the master of minas tirith?â€™ the man answered. â€˜the lord denethor or the grey wanderer?â€™
â€˜the grey wanderer or no one, it would seem,â€™ said pippin, and he sped back and up the winding way as swiftly as his feet would carry him, past the astonished porter, out through the door, and on, till he came near the gate of the citadel. the sentinel hailed him as he went by, and he recognized the voice of beregond.
â€˜whither do you run, master peregrin?â€™ he cried.
â€˜to find mithrandir,â€™ pippin answered.

beregond bowed his head to hide his tears. â€˜they said that he was dying,â€™ he sighed, â€˜and now he is dead.â€™
â€˜no,â€™ said pippin, â€˜not yet. and even now his death might be prevented, i think. but the lord of the city, beregond, has fallen before his city is taken. he is fey and dangerous.â€™ quickly he told of denethorâ€™s strange words and deeds. â€˜i must find gandalf at once.â€™
â€˜then you must go down to the battle.â€™
â€˜i know. the lord has given me leave. but, beregond, if you can, do something to stop any dreadful thing happening.â€™
â€˜the lord does not permit those who wear the black and silver to leave their post for any cause, save at his own command.â€™

red then it rolled, roaring water:
foam dyed with blood flamed at sunset;
as beacons mountains burned at evening;
red fell the dew in rammas echor.

chapter 7

the pyre of denethor

when the dark shadow at the gate withdrew gandalf still sat motionless. but pippin rose to his feet, as if a great weight had been lifted from him; and he stood listening to the horns, and it seemed to him that they would break his heart with joy. and never in after years could he hear a horn blown in the distance without tears starting in his eyes. but now suddenly his errand returned to his memory, and he ran forward. at that moment gandalf stirred and spoke to shadowfax, and was about to ri

he will kill himself, and kill faramir too. canâ€™t you do something?â€™
gandalf looked through the gaping gate, and already on the fields he heard the gathering sound of battle. he clenched his hand. â€˜i must go â€˜ he said. â€˜the black rider is abroad, and he will yet bring ruin on us. i have no time.â€™
â€˜but faramir!â€™ cried pippin. â€˜he is not dead, and they will burn him alive, if someone does not stop them.â€™
â€˜burn him alive?â€™ said gandalf. â€˜what is this tale? be quick!â€™
â€˜denethor has gone to the tombs,â€™ said pippin, â€˜and he has taken faramir, and he says we are all to burn, and he will not wait, and they are to make a pyre and burn him on it, and faramir as well. and he has sent men to fetch wood and oil. and i have told beregond, but iâ€™m afraid he wonâ€™t dare to leave his post: he is on guard. and what can he do anyway?â€™ so pippin poured out his tale, reaching up and touching gandalfâ€™s knee with trembling hands. â€˜canâ€™t you save faramir?â€™
â€˜maybe i can

eir despair and dread, seizing their weapons, crying one to another: â€˜rohan has come!â€™ captains were shouting, companies were mustering; many already were marching down to the gate.
they met the prince imrahil, and he called to them: â€˜whither now, mithrandir? the rohirrim are fighting on the fields of gondor! we must gather all the strength that we can find.â€™
â€˜you will need every man and more,â€™ said gandalf. â€˜make all haste. i will come when i can. but i have an errand to the lord denethor that will not wait. take command in the lordâ€™s absence!â€™
they passed on; and as they climbed and drew near to the citadel they felt the wind blowing in their faces, and they caught the glimmer of morning far away, a light growing in the southern sky. but it brought little hope to them, not knowing what evil lay before them, fearing to come too late.
â€˜darkness is passing,â€™ said gandalf, â€˜but it still lies heavy on this city.â€™
at the gate of the citadel they found no guard. â€˜then be

 beside the way went slowly by like grey ghosts.
suddenly the silence was broken, and they heard below them cries and the ringing of swords: such sounds as had not been heard in the hallowed places since the building of the city. at last they came to rath dÃ­nen and hastened towards the house of the stewards, looming in the twilight under its great dome.
â€˜stay! stay!â€™ cried gandalf, springing forward to the stone stair before the door. â€˜stay this madness!â€™
for there were the servants of denethor with swords and torches in their hands; but alone in the porch upon the topmost step stood beregond, clad in the black and silver of the guard; and he held the door against them. two of them had already fallen to his sword, staining the hallows with their blood; and the others cursed him, calling him outlaw and traitor to his master.
even as gandalf and pippin ran forward, they heard from within the house of the dead the voice of denethor crying: â€˜haste, haste! do as i have bidden! slay me th

is renegade! or must i do so myself?â€™ thereupon the door which beregond held shut with his left hand was wrenched open, and there behind him stood the lord of the city, tall and fell; a light like flame was in his eyes, and he held a drawn sword.
but gandalf sprang up the steps, and the men fell back from him and covered their eyes; for his coming was like the incoming of a white light into a dark place, and he came with great anger. he lifted up his hand, and in the very stroke, the sword of denethor flew up and left his grasp and fell behind him in the shadows of the house; and denethor stepped backward before gandalf as one amazed.
â€˜what is this, my lord?â€™ said the wizard. â€˜the houses of the dead are no places for the living. and why do men fight here in the hallows when there is war enough before the gate? or has our enemy come even to rath dÃ­nen?â€™
â€˜since when has the lord of gondor been answerable to thee?â€™ said denethor. â€˜or may i not command my own servants?â€™
â€˜you m

ay,â€™ said gandalf. â€˜but others may contest your will, when it is turned to madness and evil. where is your son, faramir?â€™
â€˜he lies within,â€™ said denethor, â€˜burning, already burning. they have set a fire in his flesh. but soon all shall be burned. the west has failed. it shall all go up in a great fire, and all shall be ended. ash! ash and smoke blown away on the wind!â€™
then gandalf seeing the madness that was on him feared that he had already done some evil deed, and he thrust forward, with beregond and pippin behind him, while denethor gave back until he stood beside the table within. but there they found faramir, still dreaming in his feve

g upon the table. wood was piled under it, and high all about it, and all was drenched with oil, even the garments of faramir and the coverlets; but as yet no fire had been set to the fuel. then gandalf revealed the strength that lay hid in him; even as the light of his power was hidden under his grey mantle. he leaped up on to the faggots, and raising the sick man lightly he sprang down again, and bore him towards the door. but as he did so faramir moaned and called on his father in his dream.
denethor started as one waking from a trance, and the flame died in his eyes, and he wept; and he said: â€˜do not take my son from me! he calls for me.â€™
â€˜he calls,â€™ said gandalf, â€˜but you cannot come to him yet. for he must seek healing on the threshold of death, and maybe find it not. whereas your part is to go out to the battle of your city, where maybe death awaits you. this you know in your heart.â€™
â€˜he will not wake again,â€™ said denethor. â€˜battle is vain. why should we wish to live l

onger? why should we not go to death side by side?â€™
â€˜authority is not given to you, steward of gondor, to order the hour of your death,â€™ answered gandalf. â€˜and only the heathen kings, under the domination of the dark power, did thus, slaying themselves in pride and despair, murdering their kin to ease their own death.â€™ then passing through the door he took faramir from the deadly house and laid him on the bier on which he had been brought, and which had now been set in the porch. denethor followed him, and stood trembling, looking with longing on the face of his son. and for a moment, while all were silent and still, watching the lord in his throes, he wavered.
â€˜come!â€™ said gandalf. â€˜we are needed. there is much that you can yet do.â€™
then suddenly denethor laughed. he stood up tall and proud again, and stepping swiftly back to the table he lifted from it the pillow on which his head had lain. then coming to the doorway he drew aside the covering, and lo! he had between h

nity. for a little space you may triumph on the field, for a day. but against the power that now arises there is no victory. to this city only the first finger of its hand has yet been stretched. all the east is moving. and even now the wind of thy hope cheats thee and wafts up anduin a fleet with black sails. the west has failed. it is time for all to depart who would not be slaves.â€™
â€˜such counsels will make the enemyâ€™s victory certain indeed,â€™ said gandalf.
â€˜hope on then!â€™ laughed denethor. â€˜do i not know thee, mithrandir? thy hope is to rule in my stead, to stand behind every throne, north, south, or west. i have read thy mind and its policies. do i not know that you commanded this halfling here to keep silence? that you brought him hither to be a spy within my very chamber? and yet in our speech together i have learned the names and purpose of all thy companions. so! with the left hand thou wouldst use me for a little while as a shield against mordor, and with the right bring

€˜but i say to thee, gandalf mithrandir, i will not be thy tool! i am steward of the house of anÃ¡rion. i will not step down to be the dotard chamberlain of an upstart. even were his claim proved to me, still he comes but of the line of isildur. i will not bow to such a one, last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship and dignity.â€™
â€˜what then would you have,â€™ said gandalf, â€˜if your will could have its way?â€™
â€˜i would have things as they were in all the days of my life,â€™ answered denethor, â€˜and in the days of my longfathers before me: to be the lord of this city in peace, and leave my chair to a son after me, who would be his own master and no wizardâ€™s pupil. but if doom denies this to me, then i will have naught: neither life diminished, nor love halved, nor honour abated.â€™
â€˜to me it would not seem that a steward who faithfully surrenders his charge is diminished in love or in honour,â€™ said gandalf. â€˜and at the least you shall not rob your son of his choice while hi

s death is still in doubt.â€™
at those words denethorâ€™s eyes flamed again, and taking the stone under his arm he drew a knife and strode towards the bier. but beregond sprang forward and set himself before faramir.
â€˜so!â€™ cried denethor. â€˜thou hadst already stolen half my sonâ€™s love. now thou stealest the hearts of my knights also, so that they rob me wholly of my son at the last. but in this at least thou shalt not defy my will: to rule my own end.â€™
â€˜come hither!â€™ he cried to his servants. â€˜come, if you are not all recreant!â€™ then two of them ran up the steps to him. swiftly he snatched a torch from the hand of one and sprang back into the house. before gandalf could hinder him he thrust the brand amid the fuel,

 and at once it crackled and roared into flame.
then denethor leaped upon the table, and standing there wreathed in fire and smoke he took up the staff of his stewardship that lay at his feet and broke it on his knee. casting the pieces into the blaze he bowed and laid himself on the table, clasping the palantÃ­r with both hands upon his breast. and it was said that ever after, if any man looked in that stone, unless he had a great strength of will to turn it to other purpose, he saw only two aged hands withering in flame.

ed his face away and closed the door. for a while he stood in thought, silent upon the threshold, while those outside heard the greedy roaring of the fire within. and then denethor gave a great cry, and afterwards spoke no more, nor was ever again seen by mortal men.
â€˜so passes denethor, son of ecthelion,â€™ said gandalf: then he turned to beregond and the lordâ€™s servants that stood there aghast. â€˜and so pass also the days of gondor that you have known; for good or evil they are ended. ill deeds have been done here; but let now all enmity that lies between you be put away, for it was contrived by the enemy and works his will. you have been caught in a net of warring duties that you did not weave. but think, you servants of the lord, blind in your obedience, that but for th

they looked at him, and for a while he was silent. at last he spoke. â€˜my friends,â€™ he said, â€˜and all you people of this city and of the western lands! things of great sorrow and renown have come to pass. shall we weep or be glad? beyond hope the captain of our foes has been destroyed, and you have heard the echo of his last despair. but he has not gone without woe and bitter loss. and that i might have averted but for the madness of denethor. so long has the reach of our enemy become! alas! but now i perceive how his will was able to enter into the very heart of the city.
â€˜though the stewards deemed that it was a secret kept only by themselves, long ago i guessed that here in the white tower, one at least of the seven seeing stones was preserved. in the days of his wisdom denethor did not presume to use it, nor to challenge sauron, knowing the limits of his own strength. but his wisdom failed; and i fear that as the peril of his

but Ã©omer said: â€˜already you have raised the banner of the kings and displayed the tokens of elendilâ€™s house. will you suffer these to be challenged?â€™
â€˜no,â€™ said aragorn. â€˜but i deem the time unripe; and i have no mind for strife except with our enemy and his servants.â€™
and the prince imrahil said. your words, lord, are wise, if one who is a kinsman of the lord denethor may counsel you in this matter. he is strong-willed and proud, but old; and his mood has been strange since his son was stricken down. yet i would not have you remain like a beggar at the door.â€™
â€˜not a beggar,â€™ said aragorn. â€˜say a captain of the rangers, who are unused to cities and houses of stone.â€™ and he commanded that his banner should be furled; and he did off the star of the north kingdom and gave it to the keeping of the sons of elrond.

 fallen and many stars were in the sky. and there came gandalf on foot and with him one cloaked in grey; and they met before the doors of the houses of healing. and they greeted gandalf and said: â€˜we seek the steward, and men say that he is in this house. has any hurt befallen him? and the lady Ã©owyn, where is she?â€™
and gandalf answered: â€˜she lies within and is not dead, but is near death. but the lord faramir was wounded by an evil dart, as you have heard, and he is now the steward; for denethor has departed, and his house is in ashes.â€™ and they were filled with grief and wonder at the tale that he told.
but imrahil said: â€˜so victory is shorn of gladness, and it is bitter bought, if both gondor and rohan are in one day bereft of their lords. Ã©omer rules the rohirrim. who shall rule the city meanwhile? shall we not send now for the lord aragorn?â€™
and the cloaked man spoke and said: â€˜he is come.â€™ and they saw as he stepped into the light of the lantern by the door that it was

ken.â€™
aragorn and gandalf went now to the warden of the houses of healing, and they counselled him that faramir and Ã©owyn should remain there and still be tended with care for many days.
â€˜the lady Ã©owyn,â€™ said aragorn, â€˜will wish soon to rise and depart; but she should not be permitted to do so, if you can in any way restrain her, until at least ten days be passed.â€™
â€˜as for faramir,â€™ said gandalf, â€˜he must soon learn that his father is dead. but the full tale of the madness of denethor should not be told to him, until he is quite healed and has duties to do. see that beregond and the perian who were present do not speak to him of these things yet!â€™
and the other perian meriadoc who is under my care, what of him?â€™ said the warden.
â€˜it is likely that he will be fit to arise tomorrow, for a short while,â€™ said aragorn. â€˜let him do so, if he wishes. he may walk a little in the care of his friends.â€™
â€˜they are a remarkable race,â€™ said the warden, nodding his head. â€

 steward of gondor before he died: you may triumph on the fields of the pelennor for a day, but against the power that has now arisen there is no victory. i do not bid you despair, as he did, but to ponder the truth in these words.
â€˜the stones of seeing do not lie, and not even the lord of barad-dÃ»r can make them do so. he can, maybe, by his will choose what things shall be seen by weaker minds, or cause them to mistake the meaning of what they see. nonetheless it cannot be doubted that when denethor saw great forces arrayed against him in mordor, and more still being gathered, he saw that which truly is.
â€˜hardly has our strength sufficed to beat off the first great assault. the next will be greater. this war then is without final hope, as denethor perceived. victory cannot be achieved by arms, whether you sit here to endure siege after siege, or march out to be overwhelmed beyond the river. you have only a choice of evils; and prudence would counsel you to strengthen such strong places a

â€˜then you would have us retreat to minas tirith, or dol amroth, or to dunharrow, and there sit like children on sand-castles when the tide is flowing?â€™ said imrahil.
â€˜that would be no new counsel,â€™ said gandalf. â€˜have you not done this and little more in all the days of denethor? but no! i said this would be prudent. i do not counsel prudence. i said victory could not be achieved by arms. i still hope for victory, but not by arms. for into the midst of all these policies comes the ring of power, the foundation of barad-dÃ»r, and the hope of sauron.
â€˜concerning this thing, my lords, you now all know enough for the understanding of our plight, and of sauronâ€™s. if he regains it, your valour is vain, and his victory will be swift and complete: so complete that none can

hen he heard gandalf reject the terms and doom frodo to the torment of the tower; but he had mastered himself, and now he stood beside beregond in the front rank of gondor with imrahilâ€™s men. for it seemed best to him to die soon and leave the bitter story of his life, since all was in ruin.
â€˜i wish merry was here,â€™ he heard himself saying, and quick thoughts raced through his mind, even as he watched the enemy come charging to the assault. â€˜well, well, now at any rate i understand poor denethor a little better. we might die together, merry and i, and since die we must, why not? well, as he is not here, i hope heâ€™ll find an easier end. but now i must do my best.â€™
he drew his sword and looked at it, and the intertwining shapes of red and gold; and the flowing characters of nÃºmenor glinted like fire upon the blade. â€˜this was made for just such an hour,â€™ he thought. â€˜if only i could smite that foul messenger with it, then almost i should draw level with old merry. well, iâ€™ll

ng to them all away there.â€™ he waved his hand vaguely in the air before him; but he was in fact now facing southwards, as he came back to shelobâ€™s tunnel, not west. out westward in the world it was drawing to noon upon the fourteenth day of march in the shire-reckoning. and even now aragorn was leading the black fleet from pelargir, and merry was riding with the rohirrim down the stonewain valley, while in minas tirith flames were rising and pippin watched the madness growing in the eyes of denethor. yet amid all their cares and fear the thoughts of their friends turned constantly to frodo and sam. they were not forgotten. but they were far beyond aid, and no thought could yet bring any help to samwise hamfastâ€™s son; he was utterly alone.
he came back at last to the stone door of the orc-passage, and still unable to discover the catch or bolt that held it, he scrambled over as before and dropped softly to the ground. then he made his way stealthily to the outlet of shelobâ€™s tunnel, whe
