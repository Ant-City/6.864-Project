  touchstone. come apace, good audrey; i will fetch up your goats,
    audrey. and how, audrey, am i the man yet? doth my simple feature
    content you?

  audrey. your features! lord warrant us! what features?

    capricious poet, honest ovid, was among the goths.

    good wit seconded with the forward child understanding, it
    strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room.
    truly, i would the gods had made thee poetical.

  audrey. i do not know what 'poetical' is. is it honest in deed and
    word? is it a true thing?

  touchstone. no, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning,
    and lovers are given to poetry; and what they swear in poetry may
    be said as lovers they do feign.

  audrey. do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?

  touchstone. i do, truly, for thou swear'st to me thou art honest;
    now, if thou wert a poet, i might have some hope thou didst
    feign.

  audrey. would you not have me honest?

  touchstone. no, truly, unless thou wert hard-favour'd; for honesty
    coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.

  jaques. [aside] a material fool!

  audrey. well, i am not fair; and therefore i pray the gods make me
    honest.

    to put good meat into an unclean dish.

  audrey. i am not a slut, though i thank the gods i am foul.

  touchstone. well, praised be the gods for thy foulness;
    sluttishness may come hereafter. but be it as it may be, i will
    marry thee; and to that end i have been with sir oliver martext,
    the vicar of the next village, who hath promis'd to meet me in
    this place of the forest, and to couple us.

    married of him than of another; for he is not like to marry me
    well; and not being well married, it will be a good excuse for me
    hereafter to leave my wife.

    courtier's beard; he sent me word, if i said his beard was not
    cut well, he was in the mind it was. this is call'd the retort
    courteous. if i sent him word again it was not well cut, he would
    send me word he cut it to please himself. this is call'd the quip
