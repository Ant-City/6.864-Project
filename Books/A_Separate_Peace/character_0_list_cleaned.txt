[CHARACTER] - 
                the
narrator and protagonist of the novel. when a separate peace begins,
gene is in his early thirties, visiting the devon school for the
first time in years. he is thoughtful and intelligent, with a competitive
nature and a tendency to brood. he develops a love-hate relationship
with his best friend, finny, whom he alternately adores and envies.
he often seems to want to lose hold of his own identity and live
as a part of finny, a tendency suggesting that he is strongly uncomfortable
with his own personality. yet the reader must infer this aspect
of gene, like much of his character, from the actions that he recounts
rather than from any explicit statements regarding his mindset: gene
often proves a reticent and unreliable narrator when it comes to
his own emotions.
