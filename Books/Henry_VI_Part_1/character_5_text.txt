  third messenger. my gracious lords, to add to your
    laments,
    wherewith you now bedew king henry's hearse,
    i must inform you of a dismal fight
    betwixt the stout lord talbot and the french.
  winchester. what! wherein talbot overcame? is't so?
  third messenger. o, no; wherein lord talbot was
    o'erthrown.
    the circumstance i'll tell you more at large.
    the tenth of august last this dreadful lord,
    retiring from the siege of orleans,
    having full scarce six thousand in his troop,
    by three and twenty thousand of the french
    was round encompassed and set upon.
    no leisure had he to enrank his men;

    instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges
    they pitched in the ground confusedly
    to keep the horsemen off from breaking in.
    more than three hours the fight continued;
    where valiant talbot, above human thought,
    enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
    hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;
    here, there, and everywhere, enrag'd he slew
    the french exclaim'd the devil was in arms;
    all the whole army stood agaz'd on him.
    his soldiers, spying his undaunted spirit,
    'a talbot! a talbot!' cried out amain,
    and rush'd into the bowels of the battle.
    here had the conquest fully been seal'd up
    if sir john fastolfe had not play'd t

    a base walloon, to win the dauphin's grace,

    whom all france, with their chief assembled strength,

    for living idly here in pomp and ease,
    whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,

    and lord scales with him, and lord hungerford;
    most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise.

  talbot. ha, ha, ha!
  countess. laughest thou, wretch? thy mirth shall turn to
    moan.
  talbot. i laugh to see your ladyship so fond
    to think that you have aught but talbot's shadow
    whereon to practise your severity.
  countess. why, art not thou the man?
  talbot. i am indeed.
  countess. then have i substance too.
  talbot. no, no, i am but shadow of myself.
    you are deceiv'd, my substance is not here;
    for what you see is but the smallest part
    and least proportion of humanity.
    i tell you, madam, were the whole frame here,
    it is of such a spacious lofty pitch
    your roof were not sufficient to contain 't.
  countess. this is a riddling merchant for the nonce;
    he will be here, and yet he is not here.
    how can these contrarieties agree?
  talbot. that will i show you presently.

    how say you, madam? are you now persuaded
    that talbot is but shadow of himself?
    these are his substance, sinews, arms, and strength,
    with which he yoketh your rebellious necks,
    razeth your cities, and subverts your towns,
    and in a moment makes them desolate.
  countess. victorious talbot! pardon my abuse.
    i find thou art no less than fame hath bruited,
    and more than may be gathered by thy shape.
    let my presumption not provoke thy wrath,
    for i am sorry that with reverence
    i did not entertain thee as thou art.

  john. then let me stay; and, father, do you fly.
    your loss is great, so your regard should be;
