[CHARACTER] - 
                abraham's
son and the second member in the triumvirate of israel's patriarchs.
[CHARACTER]'s importance consists less in his actions than in the way
he is acted upon by others. god tests abraham by commanding him
to kill his son [CHARACTER], and [CHARACTER]'s blindness and senility allow
his own son jacob to steal [CHARACTER]'s blessing and the inheritance
of god's covenant.
