used a moment, staring about him, and
then ran on to the bend. beyond, the path was the same -- empty in the darkening
moonlight and leading gently downhill into the deep shadow of a grove of ilex
trees. hazel stamped, and a few moments later dandelion was beside him in the
bracken. even in the midst of his fear and strain it occurred to him that
dandelion must be very fast: he had covered the distance in a flash.
     "well done," whispered dandelion. "running our risks for us, are you -- like
el-ahrairah?"*
     hazel gave him a quick, friendly glance. it was warm praise and cheered him.
what robin hood is to the english and john henry to the american negroes,
elil-hrair-rah, or el-ahrairah -- the prince with a thousand enemies -- is to
rabbits. uncle remus might well have heard of him, for some of el-ahrairah's
adventures are those of brer rabbit. for that matter, odysseus himself might
have borrowed a trick or two from the rabbit hero, for he is very old and was
never at a loss for a trick to

 deceive his enemies. once, so they say, he had to get
home by swimming across a river in which there was a large and hungry pike. el-
ahrairah combed himself until he had enough fur to cover a clay rabbit, which he
pushed into the water. the pike rushed at it, bit it and left it in disgust. after a
little, it drifted to the bank and el-ahrairah dragged it out and waited a while
before pushing it in again. after an hour of this, the pike left it alone, and when it
had done so for the fifth time, el-ahrairah swam across himself and went home.
some rabbits say he controls the weather, because the wind, the damp and the

dew are friends and instruments to rabbits against their enemies.

a story. i know you're handy that way. pipkin here can't wait to
hear it."
     dandelion looked at pipkin and realized what it was that hazel was asking him
to do. choking back his own fear of the desolate, grassless woodland, the before-
dawn-returning owls that they could hear some way off, and the extraordinary,
rank animal smell that seemed to come from somewhere rather nearer, he began.

     "long ago, frith made the world. he made all the stars, too, and the world is
one of the stars. he made them by scattering his droppings over the sky and this
is why the grass and the trees grow so thick on the world. frith makes the rivers
flow. they follow him as he goes through the sky, and when he leaves

look for him all night. frith made all the animals and birds, but when he first
made them they were all the same. the sparrow and the kestrel were friends and
they both ate seeds and flies. and the fox and the rabbit were friends and they
both ate grass. and there was plenty of grass and plenty of flies, because the
world was new and frith shone down bright and warm all day.
     "now, el-ahrairah was among the animals in those days and he had many
wives. he had so many wives that there was no counting them, and the wives had
so many young that even frith could not count them, and they ate the grass and
the dandelions and the lettuces and the clover, and el-ahrairah was the father of
them all." (bigwig growled appreciatively.) "and after a time," went on
dandelion, "after a time the grass began to grow thin and the rabbits wandered
everywhere, multiplying and eating as they went.

hen frith said to el-ahrairah, 'prince rabbit, if you cannot control your
people, i shall find ways to control them. so mark what i say.' but el-ahrairah
would not listen and he said to frith, 'my people are the strongest in the world,
for they breed faster and eat more than any of the other people. and this shows
how much they love lord frith, for of all the animals they are the most
responsive to his warmth and brightness. you must realize, my lord, how
important they are and not hinder them in their beautiful lives.'
     "frith could have killed el-ahrairah at once, but he had a mind to keep him in
the world, because he needed him to sport a

but they all arrived at different times, because frith made sure that it would
happen so. and when the blackbird came, he gave him his beautiful song, and
when the cow came, he gave her sharp horns and the strength to be afraid of no
other creature. and so in their turn came the fox and the stoat and the weasel.
and to each of them frith gave the cunning and the fierceness and the desire to
hunt and slay and eat the children of el-ahrairah. and so they went away from
frith full of nothing but hunger to kill the rabbits.
     "now, all this time el-ahrairah was dancing and mating and boasting that he
was going to frith's meeting to receive a great gift. and at last he set out for the
meeting place. but as he was going there, he stopped to rest on a soft, sandy
hillside. and while he was resting, over the hill came flying the dark swift,
screaming as he went, 'news! news! news!' for you know, this is what he has said
ever since tha

t day. so el-ahrairah called up to him and said, 'what news?' 'why,'
said the swift, 'i would not be you, el-ahrairah. for frith has given the fox and
the weasel cunning hearts and sharp teeth, and to the cat he has given silent feet
and eyes that can see in the dark, and they are gone away from frith's place to kill

and devour all that belongs to el-ahrairah.' and he dashed on over the hills. and
at that moment el-ahrairah heard the voice of frith calling, 'where is el-
ahrairah? for all the others have taken their gifts and gone and i have come to
look for him.'
     "then el-ahrairah knew that frith was too clever for him and he was
frightened. he thought that the fox and the weasel were coming with frith and he
turned to the face of the hill and began to dig. he dug a hole, but he had dug only
a little of it when frith came over the hill alone. and he saw el-ahrairah's bottom
sticking out of the hole and the s

and flying out in showers as the digging went on.
when he saw that, he called out, 'my friend, have you seen el-ahrairah, for i am
looking for him to give him my gift?' 'no,' answered el-ahrairah, without coming
out, 'i have not seen him. he is far away. he could not come.' so frith said, 'then
come out of that hole and i will bless you instead of him.' 'no, i cannot,' said el-
ahrairah, 'i am busy. the fox and the weasel are coming. if you want to bless me
you can bless my bottom, for it is sticking out of the hole.'"
     all the rabbits had heard the story before: on winter nights, when the cold
draft moved down the warren passages and the icy wet lay in the pits of the runs

eir burrows; and on summer evenings, in the grass under the red may
and the sweet, carrion-scented elder bloom. dandelion was telling it well, and
even pipkin forgot his weariness and danger and remembered instead the great
indestructibility of the rabbits. each one of them saw himself as el-ahrairah, who
could be impudent to frith and get away with it.
     "then," said dandelion, "frith felt himself in friendship with el-ahrairah, who
would not give up even when he thought the fox and the weasel were coming. and
he said, 'very well, i will bless your bottom as it sticks out of the hole. bottom, be
strength and warning and speed forever and save the life of your master. be it
so!' and as he spoke, el-ahrairah's tail grew shining white and flashed like a star;
and his back legs grew long and powerful and he thumped the hillside until the
very beetles fell off the the grass stems. he came out of the hole and tore across

you, they will kill you. but first they must catch you, digger, listener, runner,
prince with the swift warning. be cunning and full of tricks and your people shall
never be destroyed.' and el-ahrairah knew then that although he would not be
mocked, yet frith was his friend. and every evening, when frith has done his
day's work and lies calm and easy in the red sky, el-ahrairah and his children and
his children's children come out of their holes and feed and play in his sight, for
they are his friends and he has promised them that they can never be destroyed."

then came over to wait beside him. acorn, hawkbit and speedwell, decent
enough rank-and-filers as long as they were not pushed beyond their limits. last
of all came fiver, dejected and reluctant as a sparrow in the frost. as hazel turned
from the hole, the clouds in the west broke slightly and there was a sudden dazzle
of watery, pale gold light.
     "o el-ahrairah!" thought hazel. "these are rabbits we're going to meet. you
know them as well as you know us. let it be the right thing that i'm doing."
     "now, brace up, fiver!" he said aloud. "we're waiting for you, and getting
wetter every moment."
     a soaking bumblebee crawled over a thistle bloom, vibrated its wings for a few
seconds and then flew away down the field. hazel followed, leaving a dark track
behind him over the silvered grass.

     "there's something stuck on it," said hazel. "why, they're stones, pushed into
the surface! but what for?"
     "do you like it?" asked strawberry.
     hazel puzzled over the stones. they were all the same size, and pushed at
regular intervals into the soil. he could make nothing of them.
     "what are they for?" he asked again.
     "it's el-ahrairah," said strawberry. "a rabbit called laburnum did it, some
time ago now. we have others, but this is the best. worth a visit, don't you
think?"
     hazel was more at a loss than ever. he had never seen a laburnum and was

puzzled by the name, which in lapine is "poison tree." how could a rabbit be
called poison? and how could stones be el-ahrairah? what, exactly, was it that
strawberry was saying was el-ahrairah? in confusion he said, "i don't
understand."
     "it's what we call a shape," exp

lained strawberry. "haven't you seen one
before? the stones make the shape of el-ahrairah on the wall. stealing the king's

     hazel had not felt so much bewildered since blackberry had talked about the
raft beside the enborne. obviously, the stones could not possibly be anything to
do with el-ahrairah. it seemed to him that strawberry might as well have said
that his tail was an oak tree. he sniffed again and then put a paw up to the wall.
     "steady, steady," said strawberry. "you might damage it and that wouldn't do.
never mind. we'll come again some other time."
     "but where are--" hazel was beginning, when strawberry once more
interrupted him.
     "i expect you'll be hungry now. i know i am. it's going on raining all night, i'm
certain of that, but we can feed underground here, you

     the great burrow was less crowded than when they had left it. nildro-hain was
the first rabbit they met. she was among a group of three or four fine does who
were talking quietly together and seemed to be feeding as well. there was a smell
of greenstuff. evidently some kind of food was available underground, like the

threarah's lettuce. hazel stopped to speak to nildro-hain. she asked whether he
had gone as far as the well pit and the el-ahrairah of laburnum.
     "yes, we did," said hazel. "it's something quite strange to me, i'm afraid. but
i'd rather admire you and your friends than stones on a wall."
     as he said this, he noticed that cowslip had joined them and that strawberry
was talking to him quietly. he caught the words "never been near a shape" and a
moment later cowslip replied, "well, it makes no difference from our point of
view."
     hazel suddenly felt tired and depressed. he heard blackberry behind cowslip's

igwig, after his reconnaissance on the previous day, had spoken of the little
white sticks in the grass. that was it. a man had been walking over the ground
outside. that must have been what had awakened him.
     hazel lay in the warm, dark burrow with a delightful sense of security. he
could smell the man. the man could not smell him. all the man could smell was
the nasty smoke he was making. he fell to thinking of the shape in the well pit,
and then dropped into a drowsy half-dream, in which el-ahrairah said that it was
all a trick of his to disguise himself as poison tree and put the stones in the wall,
to engage strawberry's attention while he himself was getting acquainted with
nildro-hain.
     pipkin stirred and turned in his sleep, murmuring, "sayn lay narn, marli?" ("is
groundsel nice, mother?") and hazel, touched to think that he must be dreaming
of old days, rolled over on his side to give him room to settle again. at that
moment, however, he heard a rabbit approaching down some run c

     "wait," replied hazel quietly. "let them tell us if they don't like it. they have
their own ways here."
     however, the silence continued for some time, as though the other rabbits did
not care to mention what they thought was wrong.
     "it's no good," said blackberry at last. "you'll have to say something yourself,
hazel. no, why should you? i'll do it." he spoke up again. "on second thoughts,
hazel remembers that we have a good storyteller among us. dandelion will tell
you a story of el-ahrairah. that can't go wrong, anyway," he whispered.
     "which one, though?" said dandelion.
     hazel remembered the stones by the well pit. "the king's lettuce," he
answered. "they think a lot of that, i believe."
     dandelion took up his cue with the same plucky readiness that he had shown

in the wood. "i'll tell the story of the king's lettuce," he said aloud.
     "we shall enjoy that," replied cowslip immediately.

their luck. their enemies drove them out and they were forced to live down in the
marshes of kelfazin. now, where the marshes of kelfazin may be i do not know,
but at the time when el-ahrairah and his followers were living there, of all the
dreary places in the world they were the dreariest. there was no food but coarse
grass and even the grass was mixed with bitter rushes and docks. the ground was
too wet for digging: the water stood in any hole that was made. but all the other
animals had grown so suspicious of el-ahrairah and his tricks that they would not

l-ahrairah was still there. prince
rainbow had the power of the sky and the power of the hills and frith had told
him to order the world as he thought best.
     "one day, when prince rainbow was coming through the marshes, el-ahrairah
went up to him and said, 'prince rainbow, my people are cold and cannot get
underground because of the wet. their food is so dull and poor that they will be ill
when the bad weather comes. why do you keep us here against our will? we do
no harm.'
     "'el-ahrairah,' replied prince rainbow, 'all the animals know that you are a
thief and a trickster. now your tricks have caught up with you and you have to
live here until you can persuade us that you will be an honest rabbit.'
     "'then we shall never get out,' said el-ahrairah, 'for i would be ashamed to tell
my people to stop living on their wits. will you let us out if i can swim across a
lake full of pike?'
     "'no,' said prince rainbow, 'for i have heard of that trick of yours, el-ahrairah,

now how it is done.'
     "'will you let us go if i can steal the lettuces from king darzin's garden?' asked
el-ahrairah.
     "now, king darzin ruled over the biggest and richest of the animal cities in the
world at that time. his soldiers were very fierce and his lettuce garden was
surrounded by a deep ditch and guarded by a thousand sentries day and night. it
was near his palace, on the edge of the city where all his followers lived. so when
el-ahrairah talked of stealing king darzin's lettuces, prince rainbow laughed and
said,

     "'you can try, el-ahrairah, and if you succeed i will multiply your people
everywhere and no one will be able to keep them out of a vegetable garden from
now till the end of the world. but what will really happen is that you will be killed
by the soldiers and the world will be rid of a smooth, plausible rascal.'
     "'very well,' said el-ahrairah. 'we shall see.'
     "now, yona the hedgehog was nearby, looking

marshes, and he heard what passed between prince rainbow and el-ahrairah. he
slipped away to the great palace of king darzin and begged to be rewarded for
warning him against his enemies.
     "'king darzin,' he sniffled, 'that wicked thief el-ahrairah has said he will steal
your lettuces and he is coming to trick you and get into the garden.'
     "king darzin hurried down to the lettuce garden and sent for the captain of the
guard.
     "'you see these lettuces?' he said. 'not one of them has been stolen since the
seed was sown. very soon now they will be ready and then i mean to hold a great
feast for all my people. but i have heard that that scoundrel eh-ahrairah means to
come and steal them if he can. you are to double the guards; and al

     "the captain of the guard did as he was told. that night el-ahrairah came out
of the marshes of kelfazin and went secretly up to the great ditch. with him was
his trusty captain of owsla, rabscuttle. they squatted in the bushes and watched
the doubled guards patrolling up and down. when the morning came they saw all
the gardeners and weeders coming up to the wall and every one was looked at by
three guards. one was new and had come instead of his uncle who was ill, but the
guards would not let him in because they did not know him by sight and they
nearly threw h

ahrairah and rabscuttle came away in perplexity and that day, when prince
rainbow came walking through the fields, he said, 'well, well, prince with the
thousand enemies, where are the lettuces?'
     "'i am having them delivered,' answered el-ahrairah. 'there will be rather too
many to carry.' then he and rabscuttle went secretly down one of their few holes
where there was no water, put a sentry outside and thought and talked for a day
and a night.
     "on the top of the hill near king darzin's palace there was a garden and here
his many children and his chief followers' children used to be taken to play by
their mothers and nursemaids. there was no wall round the garden. it was
guarded only when the children were there; at night it was emp

was nothing to steal and no one to be hunted. the next night rabscuttle, who had
been told by el-ahrairah what he had to do, went to the garden and dug a scrape.
he hid in the scrape all night; and the next morning, when the children were
brought to play, he slipped out and joined them. there were so many children
that each one of the mothers and nursemaids thought that he must belong to
somebody else, but as he was about the same size as the children and not much
different to look at, he was able to make friends with some of them. rabscuttle
was full of tricks and games and quite soon he was runni

 brought into the stores.
     "'good,' said the king. 'we will have two or three tonight.'
     "but the next morning the king and several of his people were taken ill with
bad stomachs. whatever they ate, they kept on getting ill, because rabscuttle was
hiding in the storerooms and spoiling the food as fast as it was brought in. the
king ate several more lettuces, but he got no better. in fact, he got worse.
     "after five days rabscuttle slipped out again with the children and came back
to el-ahrairah. when he heard that the king was ill and that rabscuttle had done
all he wanted, el-ahrairah set to work to disguise himself. he clipped his white
tail and made rabscuttle nibble his fur short and stain it with mud and
blackberries. then he covered himself all over with trailing strands of goose grass
and big burdocks and he even found ways to alter his smell. at last even his own
wives could not recognize him, and el-ahrairah told rabscuttle to follow some
way behind and off he went to king da

outside, on the top of the hill.
     "when he got to the palace, el-ahrairah demanded to see the captain of the
guard. 'you are to take me to the king,' he said. 'prince rainbow has sent me. he
has heard that the king is ill and he has sent for me, from the distant land beyond
kelfazin, to find the cause of his sickness. be quick! i am not accustomed to be
kept waiting.'
     "'how do i know this is true?' asked the captain of the guard.
     "'it is all one to me,' replied el-ahrairah. 'what is the sickness of a little king to

     "he turned and began to go away, but the captain of the guard became
frightened and called him back. el-ahrairah allowed himself to be persuaded and
the soldiers took him to the king.
     "after five days of bad food and bad stomach, the king was not inclined to be
suspicious of someone who said that prince rainbow had sent him to make him
better. he begged el-ahrairah to examine him and promised to do all he said.
     "el-ahrairah made a great business of examining the king. he looked at his
eyes and his ears and his teeth and his droppings and the ends of his claws and he

is to put the matter for you in simple terms, insofar as i can. medically speaking,
there are certain complexities with which i will not weary you.'
     "'i cannot believe it,' said the king.
     "'the simplest course,' said el-ahrairah, 'will be to prove it to you. but we need
not make one of your subjects ill. tell the soldiers to go out and take a prisoner.'
     "the soldiers went out and the first creature they found was rabscuttle,
grazing on the hilltop. they dragged him through the gates and into the king's
presence.

but, in any event, let us be thankful it was not your majesty. well, he has served
our purpose. throw him out! i would strongly advise your majesty,' went on el-

and seed. the infection will spread. i know it is disappointing, but you must get
rid of them.'

attack your majesty's garden and steal the royal lettuces. may i have your
majesty's order to take out the soldiers and destroy them?'
     "'aha!' said the king. 'i have thought of a trick worth two of that. "particularly
deadly to rabbits." well! well! let them have all the lettuces they want. in fact,
you are to take a thousand down to the marshes of kelfazin and leave them there.
ho! ho! what a joke! i feel all the better for it!'

of a great people. i believe you are already recovering. as with many illnesses, the
cure is simple, once perceived. no, no, i will accept no reward. in any case, there
is nothing here that would be thought of value in the shining land beyond the

perhaps you will be so good as to tell your guards to accompany me to the foot of

 that evening, as el-ahrairah was urging his rabbits to growl more
fiercely and run up and down in the marshes of kelfazin, prince rainbow came
over the river.

     "'it is quite possible,' said el-ahrairah. 'the dreaded lousepedoodle--'
     "'there are a thousand lettuces in a pile at the top of the marsh. who put them
there?'
     "'i told you they were being delivered,' said el-ahrairah. 'you could hardly
expect my people, weak and hungry as they are, to carry them all the way from
king darzin's garden. however, they will soon recover now, under the treatment
that i shall prescribe. i am a physician, i may say, and if you have not heard as

     "but he must know it, surely?" muttered blackberry to hazel.
     "i always think these traditional stories retain a lot of charm," said another of
the rabbits, "especially when they're told in the real, old-fashioned spirit."

     "yes," said strawberry. "conviction, that's what it needs. you really have to
believe in el-ahrairah and prince rainbow, don't you? then all the rest follows."
     "don't say anything, bigwig," whispered hazel: for bigwig was scuffling his
paws indignantly. "you can't force them to like it if they don't. let's wait and see
what they can do themselves." aloud, he said, "our stories haven't changed in
generations, you know. after all, we haven't changed ourselves. our lives have
been the same as our fathers' and their fathers' before them. things are different
here. we realize that, and we thin

we're all wondering what kind of things you tell stories about."
     "well, we don't tell the old stories very much," said cowslip. "our stories and
poems are mostly about our own lives here. of course, that shape of laburnum
that you saw -- that's old-fashioned now. el-ahrairah doesn't really mean much to
us. not that your friend's story wasn't very charming," he added hastily.
     "el-ahrairah is a trickster," said buckthorn, "and rabbits will always need
tricks."
     "no," said a new voice from the further end of the hall, beyond cowslip.
"rabbits need dignity and, above all, the will to accept their fate."
     "we think silverweed is one of the best poets we've had for many months,"
said cowslip. "his ideas have a great following. would you like to hear him now?"
     "yes, yes," said voices from all sides. "silverweed!"

a death hole! the whole place is one foul elil's larder! it's snared -- everywhere,

here."
     he sat still and his words seemed to come crawling up the sunlight, over the
grass.
     "listen, dandelion. you're fond of stories, aren't you? i'll tell you one -- yes,
one for el-ahrairah to cry at. once there was a fine warren on the edge of a wood,
overlooking the meadows of a farm. it was big, full of rabbits. then one day the
white blindness came and the rabbits fell sick and died. but a few survived, as
they always do. the warren became almost empty. one day the farmer thought, 'i
could increase those rabbits: make them part of my farm -- their meat, their
skins. why should i bother to keep rabbits in hutches? they'll do very well where
they are.' he began to shoot all elil

dge gap and the wood path. so they lived as he wanted
them to live and all the time there were a few who disappeared. the rabbits
became strange in many ways, different from other rabbits. they knew well
enough what was happening. but even to themselves they pretended that all was
well, for the food was good, they were protected, they had nothing to fear but the
one fear; and that struck here and there, never enough at a time to drive them
away. they forgot the ways of wild rabbits. they forgot el-ahrairah, for what use
had they for tricks and cunning, living in the enemy's warren and paying his
price? they found out other marvelous arts to take the place of tricks and old
stories. they danced in ceremonious greeting. they sang songs like the birds and
made shapes on the walls; and though these could help them not at all, yet they
passed the time and enabled them to tell themselves that they were splendid
fellows, the very flower of rabbitry, cleverer than magpies. they had no chief
rabbit -- no,

singers, beautiful and sick like oak apples, like robins' pincushions on the wild
rose. and since they could not bear the truth, these singers, who might in some
other place have been wise, were squeezed under the terrible weight of the
warren's secret until they gulped out fine folly -- about dignity and acquiescence,

     "frith in a pond!" muttered bigwig, further down the run. "and so will all his

to dig us a burrow or two, hazel?"
     hazel watched the mouse make off into the long grass. then he returned to the
honeycomb and settled down near holly, who had just begun to speak.

     rabbits (says mr. lockley) are like human beings in many ways. one of these
is certainly their staunch ability to withstand disaster and to let the stream of
their life carry them along, past reaches of terror and loss. they have a certain
quality which it would not be accurate to describe as callousness or indifference.

d imagination and an intuitive feeling that
life is now. a foraging wild creature, intent above all upon survival, is as strong
as the grass. collectively, rabbits rest secure upon frith's promise to el-ahrairah.
hardly a full day had elapsed since holly had come crawling in delirium to the
foot of watership down. yet already he was near recovery, while the more light-
hearted bluebell seemed even less the worse for the dreadful catastrophe that he
had survived. hazel and his companions had suffered extremes of grief and
horror during the telling of holly's tale. pipkin had cried and trembled piteously
at the death of scabious, and acorn and speedwell had been seized with

     "what do you think?" said silver to blackberry.
     "i think it's a good idea, but real opportunities of the kind hazel has in mind
aren't likely to come very often."
     "i think that's about right," said holly, wincing as silver resumed licking. "the
idea's all right as far as it goes, but it won't come to a great deal in practice."
     "i'm ready to give it a try," said silver. "i reckon it'll be worth it, just to see
bigwig telling bedtime stories to a mole."
     "el-ahrairah did it once," said bluebell, "and it worked. do you remember?"
     "no," said hazel, "i don't know that story. let's have it."
     "let's silflay first," said holly. "this ear's had all i can stand for the time
being."
     "well, at least it's clean now," said hazel. "but i'm afraid it'll never be as good
as the other, you know. you'll have a ragged ear."

     they found strawberry and buckthorn on the bank; and when everyone was
comfortably chewing, with ears laid flat, bluebell began.

     "dandelion was telling me last night about cowslip's warren and how he told
the story of the king's lettuce. that's what put me in mind of this tale, even
before hazel explained his idea. i used to hear it from my grandfather and he
always said that it happened after el-ahrairah had got his people out of the
marshes of kelfazin. they went to the meadows of fenlo and there they dug their
holes. but prince rainbow had his eye on el-ahrairah; and he was determined to
see that he didn't get up to any more of his tricks.
     "now one evening, when el-ahrairah and rabscuttle were sitting on a sunny
bank, prince rainbow came through the meadows and with him was a rabbit that
el-ahrairah had never seen before.
     "'good evening, el-ahrairah,' said prince rainbow. 'this is a

 great
improvement on the marshes of kelfazin. i see all your does are busy digging
holes along the bank. have they dug a hole for you?'
     "'yes,' said el-ahrairah. 'this hole here belongs to rabscuttle and myself. we
liked the look of this bank as soon as we saw it.'
     "'a very nice bank,' said prince rainbow. 'but i am afraid i have to tell you, el-
ahrairah, that i have strict orders from lord frith himself not to allow you to
share a hole with rabscuttle.'
     "'not share a hole with rabscuttle?' said el-ahrairah. 'why ever not?'
     "'el-ahrairah,' said prince rainbow, 'we know you and your tricks: and
rabscuttle is nearly as slippery as you are

. both of you in one hole would be

altogether too much of a good thing. you would be stealing the clouds out of the
sky before the moon had changed twice. no -- rabscuttle must go and look after
the holes at the other end of the warren. let me introduce you. this is hufsa. i
want you to be his friend and look after him.'
     "'where does he come from?' asked el-ahrairah. 'i certainly haven't seen him
before.'
     "'he comes from another country,' said prince rainbow, 'but he is no different
from any other rabbit. i hope you will help him to settle down here. and while he
is getting to know the place, i'm sure you will be glad to let him share your hole.'
     "el-ahrairah and rabscuttle felt desperately annoyed that they were not to be
allowed to live together in their hole. but it was one of el-ahrairah's rules never to
let anyone see when he was angry and, 
 
 ___________________________
 
besides, he felt sorry for hufsa because he
supposed that he was feeling lonely and awkward, being far away from his own
people. so he welcomed him and promised to help him settle down. hufsa was
perfectly friendly and seemed anxious to please everyone; and rabscuttle moved
down to the other end of the warren.
     "after a time, however, el-ahrairah began to find that something was always
going wrong with his plans. one night, in the spring, when he had taken some of
his people to a cornfield to eat the green shoots, they found a man with a gun
walking about in the moonlight and were lucky to get away without trouble.
another time, after el-ahrairah had reconnoitered the way to a cabbage garden
and scratched a hole under the fence, he arrived the next morning to find it
blocked with wire, and he began to suspect that his plans were leaking

set a trap for hufsa, to find out whether it was he
who was at the bottom of the trouble. he showed him a path across the fields and
told him that it led to a lonely barn full of swedes and turnips: and he went on to
say that he and rabscuttle meant to go there the next morning. in fact el-
ahrairah had no such plans and took care not to say anything about the path or
the barn to anyone else. but next day, when he went cautiously along the path, he
found a wire set in the grass.
     "this made el-ahrairah really angry, for any of his people might have been
snared and killed. of course he did not suppose that hufsa was setting wires
himself, or even that he had known that a wire was going to be set. but evidently
hufsa was in touch with somebody who did not stick at setting a wire. in the end,
el-ahrairah decided that probably prince rainbow was passing on hufsa's
information to a farmer or a gamekeeper and not bothering himself about what
happpened as a result. his rabbits' lives were in danger

because of hufsa -- to say
nothing of all the lettuces and cabbages they were missing. after this, el-ahrairah
tried not to tell hufsa anything at all. but it was difficult to prevent him from
hearing things because, as you all know, rabbits are very good at keeping secrets
from other animals, but no good at keeping secrets from each other. warren life
doesn't make for secrecy. he considered killing hufsa. but he knew that if he did,
prince rainbow would come and they would end in more trouble. he felt
decidedly uneasy even about keeping things from hufsa, because he thought that
if hufsa realized that

they knew he was a spy, he would tell prince rainbow and
prince rainbow would probably take him away and think of something worse.

     "el-ahrairah thought and thought. he was still thinking the next evening,
when prince rainbow paid one of his visits to the warren.
     "'you are quite a reformed character these days, el-ahrairah,' said prince
rainbow. 'if you are not careful, people will begin to trust you. since i was
passing by, i thought i would just stop to thank you for your kindness in looking
after hufsa. he seems quite at home with you.'
     "'yes, he does, doesn't he?' said el-ahrairah. 'we grow in beauty side by side;
we fill one hole with glee. but i always say to my people, "put not your trust in
princes, nor in any--"'
     "'well, el-ahrairah,' said prince rainbow, interrupting him, 'i am sure i can

t you. and to prove it, i have decided that i will grow a nice crop of carrots in
the field behind the hill. it is an excellent bit of ground and i am sure they will do
well. especially as no one would dream of stealing them. in fact, you can come
and watch me plant them, if you like.'
     "'i will,' said el-ahrairah. 'that will be delightful.'
     "el-ahrairah, rabscuttle, hufsa and several other rabbits accompanied prince
rainbow to the field behind the hill; and they helped him to sow it with long rows
of carrot seed. it was a light, dry sort of soil -- just the thing for carrots -- and the
whole business infuriated el-ahrairah, because he was certain that prince
rainbow was doing it to tease him and to show that he felt sure that he had
clipped his claws at last.
     "'that will do splendidly,' said prince rainbow when they had finished. 'of

se, i know that no one would dream of stealing my carrots. but if they did --
if they did steal them, el-ahrairah -- i should be very angry indeed. if king darzin
stole them, for instance, i feel sure that lord frith would take away his kingdom
and give it to someone else.'
     "el-ahrairah knew that prince rainbow meant that if he caught him stealing
the carrots he would either kill him or else banish him and put some other rabbit
over his people: and the thought that the other rabbit would probably be hufsa
made him grind his teeth. but he said, 'of course, of course. very right and
proper.' and prince rainbow went away.
     "one night, in the second moon after the planting, el-ahrairah and rabscuttle
went to look at the carrots. no one had thinned them out and the tops were th

and green. el-ahrairah judged that most of the roots would be a little thinner than
a forepaw. and it was while he was looking at them in the moonlight that his plan
came to him. he had become so cautious about hufsa -- and indeed no one ever
knew where hufsa would be next -- that on the way back he and rabscuttle made
for a hole in a lonely bank and went down it to talk together. and there el-
ahrairah promised rabscuttle not only that he would steal prince rainbow's
carrots, but also that between them they would se

bargain. they came out of the hole and rabscuttle went to the farm to steal some
seed corn. el-ahrairah spent the rest of the night gathering slugs; and a nasty
business it was.
     "the next evening el-ahrairah went out early and after a little while found
yona the hedgehog pottering along the hedge.
     "'yona,' he said, "would you like a whole lot of nice, fat slugs?'
     "'yes, i would, el-ahrairah,' said yona, 'but they're not so easily found. you'd

know that if you were a hedgehog.'
     "'well, here are some nice ones,' said el-ahrairah, 'and you can have them all.
but i can give you a great many more if you will do what i say and ask no
questions. can you sing?'
     "'sing, el-ahrairah? no hedgehog can sing.'
     "'good,' said el-ahrairah. 'excellent. but you will have to try if you want those
slugs. ah! there is an old, empty box, i see, that the farmer has left in the ditch.

i never go near water if i can avoid it, rabscuttle,' said hawock. 'i dislike it
very much. but i suppose if i had to, i could make shift to keep afloat for a little
while.'
     "'splendid,' said rabscuttle. 'now attend. i have a whole lot of corn -- and you
know how scarce it is at this time of year -- and you can have it all, if only you will
do a little swimming in the pond on the edge of the wood. just let me explain as
we go down there.' and off they went through the wood.
     "fu inlé, el-ahrairah strolled into his hole and found hufsa chewing pellets.
'ah, hufsa, you're here,' he said. 'that's fine. i can't trust anyone else, but you'll
come with me, won't you? just you and i -- no one else must know.'
     "'why, what's to be done, el-ahrairah?' asked hufsa.
     "'i've been looking at those carrots of prince rainbow's,' replied el-ahrairah. 'i
can't stand it any longer. they're the best i've ever seen. i'm determined to steal
them -- or most of them, anyway. of course, if i took a lot

 of rabbits on an
expedition of this kind we'd soon be in trouble. things would leak out and prince
rainbow would be sure to get to hear. but if you and i go alone, no one will ever
know who did it.'
     "'i'll come,' said hufsa. 'let's go tomorrow night.' for he thought that that
would give him time to tell prince rainbow.
     "'no,' said el-ahrairah, 'i'm going now. at once.'
     "he wondered whether hufsa would try to turn him against this idea, but
when he looked at him he could see that hufsa was thinking that this would be
the end of el-ahrairah and that he himself would be made king of the rabbits.
     "they set out together in the moonlight.
     "they had gone a good way along the hedge when they came upon an old box
lying in the ditch. sitting on top of the box was yona the hedgehog. his prickles
were stuck all over with dog-rose

 petals and he was making an extraordinary
squeaking, grunting noise and waving his black paws. they stopped and looked at
him.
     "'whatever are you doing, yona?' asked hufsa in astonishment.
     "'singing to the moon,' answered yona. 'all hedgehogs have to sing to the
moon to make the slugs come. surely you know that?

     "'o slug-a-moon, o slug-a-moon,
     o grant thy faithful hedgehog's boon!'

     "'what a frightful noise!' said el-ahrairah and indeed it was. 'let's get on

quickly before he brings all the elil round us.' and on they went.
     "after a time they drew near the pond on the edge of the wood. as they
approached it they heard a squawking and splashing and then they saw hawock
the pheasant scuttering about in the water, with his long tail feathers floating out
behind him.
     "'whatever has happened?' said hufsa. 'hawock, have you been shot?'
     "'no, no,' replied hawock. 'i always go swimming in the full moon. it

my tail grow longer and, besides, my head wouldn't stay red, white and green
without swimming. but you must know that, hufsa, surely? everyone knows
that.'
     "'the truth is, he doesn't like other animals to catch him at it,' whispered el-
ahrairah. 'let's go on.'
     "a little further on they came to an old well by a big oak tree. the farmer had
filled it up long ago, but the mouth looked very deep and black in the moonlight.
     "'let's have a rest,' said el-ahrairah, 'just for a short time.'
     "as he spoke, a most curious-looking creature came out of the grass. it looked
something like a rabbit, but even in the moonlight they could see that it had a red
tail and long green ears. in its mouth it was carrying the end of one of the white
sticks that men burn. it was rabscuttle, but not even hufsa could recognize him.
he had found some sheep-dip powder at the farm and sat in it to make his tail
red. his ears were festooned with trails of bryony and the whit

him feel ill.
     "'frith preserve us!' said el-ahrairah. 'what can it be? let's only hope it isn't
one of the thousand!' he leaped up, ready to run. 'who are you?' he asked,
trembling.
     "rabscuttle spat out the white stick.
     "'so!' he said commandingly. 'so you have seen me, el-ahrairah! many rabbits
live out their lives and die, but few see me. few or none! i am one of the rabbit
messengers of lord frith, who go about the earth secretly by day and return
nightly to his golden palace! he is even now awaiting me on the other side of the
world and i must go to him swiftly, through the heart of the earth! farewell, el-

     "the strange rabbit leaped over the edge of the well and disappeared into the
darkness below.

irah in an awe-stricken voice.
'how dreadful is this place! let us go quickly!'
     "they hurried on and presently they came to prince rainbow's field of carrots.
how many they stole i cannot say; but of course, as you know, el-ahrairah is a
great prince and no doubt he used powers unknown to you and me. but my
grandfather always said that before morning the field was stripped bare. the
carrots were hidden down a deep hole in the bank beside the wood and el-
ahrairah and hufsa made their way home. el-ahrairah collected two or three
followers and stayed underground with them all day, but hufsa went out in the
afternoon without saying where he was going.
     "that evening, as el-ahrairah and his people began to silflay under a

sky, prince rainbow came over the fields. behind him were two great black dogs.
     "'el-ahrairah,' he said, 'you are under arrest.'

     "'what for?' asked el-ahrairah.
     "'you know very well what for,' said prince rainbow. 'let me have no more of
your tricks and insolence, el-ahrairah. where are the carrots?'
     "'if i am under arrest,' said el-ahrairah, 'may i be told what for? it is not fair to
tell me i am under arrest and then to ask me questions.'
     "'come, come, el-ahrairah,' said prince rainbow, 'you are merely wasting time.
tell me where the carrots are and i will only send you to the great north and not
kill you.'
     "'prince rainbow,' said el-ahrairah, 'for the third time, may i know for what i
am under arrest?'
     "'very well,' said prince rainbow, 'if this is the way you want to die, el-
ahrairah, you shall have the full process of law. you are under arrest for stealing
my carrots. are you seriously asking for a trial? i warn you that i have direct

nce and it will go ill with you.'
     "by this time all el-ahrairah's people were crowding round, as near as they
dared for the dogs. only rabscuttle was nowhere to be seen. he had spent the
whole day moving the carrots to another secret hole and he was now hiding
because he could not get his tail white again.
     "'yes, i would like a trial,' said el-ahrairah, 'and i would like to be judged by a
jury of animals. for it is not right, prince rainbow, that you should both accuse
me and be the judge as well.'
     "'a jury of animals you shall have,' said prince rainbow. 'a jury of elil, el-
ahrairah. for a jury of rabbits would refuse to convict you, in spite of the
evidence.'
     "to everyone's surprise, el-ahrairah immediately replied that he would be
content with a jury of elil: and prince rainbow said that he would bring them that
night. el-ahrair

outside. none of his people was allowed to see him, although many tried.
     "up and down the hedges and copses the news spread that el-ahrairah was on
trial for his life and that prince rainbow was going to bring him before a jury of
elil. animals came crowding in. fu inlé, prince rainbow returned with the elil --
two badgers, two foxes, two stoats, an owl and a cat. el-ahrairah was brought up
and placed between the dogs. the elil sat staring at him and their eyes glittered in
the moon. they licked their lips: and the dogs muttered that they had been
promised the task of carrying out the sentence. there were a great many animals
-- rabbits and others -- and every one of them felt sure that this time it was all up
with el-ahrairah.

el-ahrairah had come the night before, when he was quietly chewing pellets, and
terrified him into going with him to steal prince rainbow's carrots. he had
wanted to refuse, but he had been too much frightened. the carrots were hidden
in a hole that he could show them. he had been forced to do what he did, but the
next day he had gone as quickly as possible to tell prince rainbow, whose loyal
servant he was.
     "'we will recover the carrots later,' said prince rainbow. 'now, el-ahrairah,

     "'i would like to ask the witness some questions,' said el-ahrairah; and the elil
agreed that this was only fair.
     "'now, hufsa,' said el-ahrairah, 'can we hear a little more about this journey
that you and i are supposed to have made? for really i can remember nothing
about it at all. you say we went out of the hole and set off in the night. what
happened then?'
     "'why, el-ahrairah,' said hufsa, 'you can't possibly have forgotten. we came
along by the ditch, and don't you remember that we saw a hedgehog sitting on a
box singing a song to the moon?'
     "'a hedgehog doing what?' said one of the badgers.
     "'singing a song to the moon,' said hufsa eagerly. they do that, you know, to
make the slugs come. he had rose petals stuck all over him and he was waving his
paws and--'

     "'but he was,' shouted hufsa. 'he was singing, "o slug-a-moon! o slug-a-
moon! o grant--"'
     "'what the hedgehog sang is not evidence,' said el-ahrairah. 'really, one is
inclined to wonder what is. well, all right. we saw a hedgehog covered with roses,
singing a song on a box. what happened then?'
     "'well,' said hufsa, 'then we went on and came to the pond, where we saw a
pheasant.'
     "'pheasant, eh?' said one of the foxes. 'i wish i'd seen it. what was it doing?'
     "'it was swimming round and round in the water,' said hufsa.
     "'wounded, eh?' said the fox.
     "'no, no,' said hufsa. 'they all do that, to make their tails grow lon

surprised you don't know.'
     "'to make what?' said the fox.
     "'to make their tails grow longer,' said hufsa sulkily. 'he said so himself.'
     "'you've only had this stuff for a very short time,' said el-ahrairah to the elil. 'it
takes a bit of getting used to. look at me. i've been forced to live with it for the
last two months, day in and day out. i've been as kind and understanding as i can,
but apparently just to my own harm.'
     "a silence fell. el-ahrairah, with an air of fatherly patience, turned back to the
witness.
     "'my memory is so bad,' he said. 'do go on.'
     "'well, el-ahrairah,' said hufsa, 'you're pretending very cleverly, but even you
won't be able to say you've forgotten what happened next. a huge, terrifying
rabbit, with a red tail and green ears, came out of the grass. he had a white stick
in his mouth and he plunged into the ground down a great hole. he told us he
was going through the middle of the earth to see lord frith on

 the other side.'
     "this time not one of the elil said a word. they were staring at hufsa and
shaking their heads.
     "'they're all mad, you know,' whispered one of the stoats, 'nasty little beasts.
they'll say anything when they're cornered. but this one is the worst i've ever

heard. how much longer have we got to stay here? i'm hungry.'
     "now el-ahrairah had known beforehand that while elil detest all rabbits, they
would dislike most the one who looked the biggest fool. that was why he had
agreed to a jury of elil. a jury of rabbits might have tried, to get to the bottom of
hufsa's story; but not the elil, for they hated and despised the witness and wanted
to be off hunting as soon as they could.
     "'so it comes to this,' said el-ahrairah. 'we saw a hedgehog covered with roses,
singing a song: and then we saw a perfectly healthy pheasant swi

and round the pond: and then we saw a rabbit with a red tail, green ears and a
white stick, and he jumped straight down a deep well. is that right?'
     "'yes,' said hufsa.
     "'and then we stole the carrots?'
     "'yes.'
     "'were they purple with green spots?'
     "'were what purple with green spots?'
     "'the carrots.'
     "'well, you know they weren't, el-ahrairah. they were the ordinary color.
they're down the hole!' shouted hufsa desperately. 'down the hole! go and look!'
     "the court adjourned while hufsa led prince rainbow to the hole. they found
no carrots and returned.
     "'i've been underground all day,' said el-ahrairah, 'and i can prove it. i ought
to have been asleep, but it's very difficult when m'learned friend -- well, never
mind. i simply mean that obviously i couldn't have been out moving carrots or
anything else. if there ever were a

ny carrots,' he added. 'but i've nothing more to
say.'
     "'prince rainbow,' said the cat, 'i hate all rabbits. but i don't see how we can
possibly say that it's been proved that that rabbit took your carrots. the witness is
obviously out of his mind -- mad as the mist and snow -- and the prisoner will
have to be released.' they all agreed.
     "'you had better go quickly,' said prince rainbow to el-ahrairah. 'go down
your hole, el-ahrairah, before i hurt you myself.'
     "'i will, my lord,' said el-ahrairah. 'but may i beg you to remove that rabbit you
sent among us, for he troubles us with his foolishness?'
     "so hufsa went away with prince rainbow and el-ahrairah's people were left
in peace, apart from indigestion brought on by eating too many carrots. but it was
a long time before rabscuttle could get his tail white again, so my grandfather
always said."

companion. he would not hear of the gull going out to forage. before ni-frith the
rabbits had managed to produce as much as it could eat -- for a time, at all events
-- and were able to sleep through the heat of the day. bigwig, however, remained
with the gull, making no secret of his admiration, talking and listening to it for
several hours. at the evening feed he joined hazel and holly near the bank where
bluebell had told his story of el-ahrairah.
     "how's the bird now?" asked hazel.
     "a good deal better, i think," replied bigwig. "he's very tough, you know. my
goodness, what a life he's had! you don't know what you're missing! i could sit
and listen to him all day."
     "how was it hurt?"
     "a cat jumped on him in a farmyard. he never heard it until the last moment.

 had said. he was simply the one -- as a chief
rabbit ought to be -- through whom a strong feeling, latent throughout the
warren, had come to the surface. but his plan to make use of the gull excited
everyone and was seen as something that not even blackberry could have hit
upon. reconnaissance is familiar to all rabbits -- indeed, it is second nature -- but
the idea of making use of a bird, and one so strange and savage, convinced them
that hazel, if he could really do it, must be as clever as el-ahrairah himself.
     for the next few days a lot of hard work went into feeding kehaar. acorn and
pipkin, boasting that they were the best insect-catchers in the warren, brought in
great numbers of beetles and grasshoppers. at first the gull's principal hardship
was lack of water. he suffered a good deal and was reduced to tearing at the
stems of the long grasses for moisture. however, during his third night in the
warren it rained for three or four hours and puddles formed on the track. a

after all he would be off to the big water and the raucous, teeming gull colonies
of which he had spoken with such feeling to bigwig. as far as he was able, he kept
his anxiety to himself, but one day when they were alone, he asked fiver whether
he thought kehaar would return.
     "he will return," said fiver unhesitatingly.
     "and what will he bring with him?"
     "how can i tell?" replied fiver. but later, when they were underground, silent
and drowsy, he said suddenly, "the gifts of el-ahrairah. trickery; great danger;

and blessing for the warren." when hazel questioned him again, he seemed to be
unaware that he had spoken and could add nothing more.
     bigwig spent most of the hours of daylight watching for kehaar's return. he
was inclined to be surly and short, and once, when bluebell remarked that he
thought meester pigvig's fur cap was molting in sympathy for absent friends, he
showed a flash of his old sergeant-major spirit and cuffed and abused him twice

nervous and some of them don't have any kittens on that account. at least, the
kittens begin to grow inside them and then they melt away again into their
bodies. you know this?"
     "i didn't know," said strawberry.
     "that's because you've never been overcrowded. but our warren -- the
threarah's warren -- was overcrowded a year or two back and a lot of the younger
does were re-absorbing their litters before they were born. the threarah told me
that long ago el-ahrairah made a bargain with frith. frith promised him that
rabbits were not to be born dead or unwanted. if there's little chance of a decent
life for them, it's a doe's privilege to take them back into her body unborn."
     "yes, i remember the bargain story," said hazel. "so you think there may be
discontented does? that's hopeful. we're agreed, then, that we ought to send an
expedition to this warren and that there's a good chance of being successful
without fighting. do you want everyone to go?"

fly out later in the day, to make sure they were going in the right direction and
bring back news of their progress. hazel and bigwig went with them to the
southern end of the hanger and watched as they slipped away, heading to the west
of the distant farm. holly seemed confident and the other three were in high
spirits. soon they were lost to sight in the grass and hazel and bigwig turned back
into the wood.
     "well, we've done the best we can," said hazel. "the rest's up to them and to
el-ahrairah now. but surely it ought to be all right?"
     "not a doubt of it," said bigwig. "let's hope they're back soon. i'm looking
forward to a nice doe and a litter of kittens in my burrow. lots of little bigwigs,
hazel! think of that, and tremble!"

     "we fed again some time before ni-frith the next day, and then it was back
underground. the time dragged terribly. at last -- it must have been as evening
was coming on -- i joined a little group of rabbits listening to a story. and do you
know, it was 'the king's lettuce'? the rabbit who was telling it was nowhere near
as good as dandelion, but i listened all the same, just for something to do. and it
was when he got to the bit where el-ahrairah dresses up and pretends to be the
doctor at king darzin's palace that i suddenly had an idea. it was a very risky one,

but i thought there was a chance that it might work, simply because every rabbit
in efrafa usually does what he's told without question. i'd been watching captain
bugloss and he struck me as a nice enough fellow, conscientious and a bit weak
and rather harassed by having more to do than he could really cope with.

no hard task to get him to accept it.
     "hrairoo," said hazel one evening, "what would we have done without you?
we'd none of us be here, would we?"
     "you're sure we are here, then?" asked fiver.
     "that's too mysterious for me," replied hazel. "what do you mean?"
     "well, there's another place -- another country, isn't there? we go there when
we sleep; at other times, too; and when we die. el-ahrairah comes and goes
between the two as he wants, i suppose, but i could never quite make that out,
from the tales. some rabbits will tell you it's all easy there, compared with the
waking dangers that they understand. but i think that only shows they don't
know much about it. it's a wild place, and very unsafe. and where are we really --
there or here?"
     "our bodies stay here -- that's good enough for me. you'd better go and talk to
that silverweed fellow -- he might know more."

saved him the trouble.
     "will you tell us a story, dandelion?" he asked.
     "yes! yes!" said several others. "come on! make it a stunner while you're at it!"
     "all right," said dandelion. "how about 'el-ahrairah and the fox in the
water'?"
     "let's have 'the hole in the sky,'" said hawkbit.
     "no, not that," said bigwig suddenly. he had spoken very little all the evening
and everyone looked round. "if you're going to tell a story, there's only one i
want," he went on. "'el-ahrairah and the black rabbit of inlé.'"

     "sooner or later, everything leaks out and animals get to hear what others
think about them. some say that it was hufsa who told king darzin the truth
about the trick with the lettuces. others say that yona the hedgehog went
gossiping in the copses. but, h

owever it was, king darzin got to know that he had
been made a fool when he delivered his lettuces to the marshes of kelfazin. he
did not call his soldiers out to fight -- not yet. but he made up his mind that he
would find an opportunity to get his own back on el-ahrairah. el-ahrairah knew
this and he warned all his people to be careful, especially when they went about
alone.
     "now late one afternoon in february, rabscuttle led some of the rabbits out to
a rubbish heap on the edge of a garden, some way away from the warren. the
evening came on cold and misty, and well before twilight a fog came down thick.
they set off for home, but they got lost; and then they had trouble with an owl
and became confused over their direction. anyway, rabscuttle got separated from

ers, and after wandering about for some time, he strayed into the guards'
quarters outside king darzin's city; and they caught him and took him up to the
king.
     "king darzin saw his chance to spite el-ahrairah. he put rabscuttle into a
special prison hole and every day he was brought out and made to work,
sometimes in the frost, digging and tunneling. but el-ahrairah swore he would
get him out somehow. and so he did, for he and two of his does spent four days
digging a tunnel from the wood into the back of the bank where rabscuttle had
been set to work. and in the end this tunnel came near to the hole in the bank
down which rabscuttle had been sent. he was supposed to be digging to turn the
hole into a storeroom and the guards were watching outside while he worked. but
el-ahrairah reached him, for he could hear him scratching in the dark; and they

ed away down the tunnel and escaped through the wood.
     "when the news reached king darzin, he became very angry indeed, and he
determined that this time he would start a war and finish el-ahrairah once and
for all. his soldiers set out in the night and went to the meadows of fenlo; but
they couldn't get down the rabbit holes. some tried, to be sure, but they soon
came out again, because they met el-ahrairah and the other rabbits. they were
not used to fighting in narrow places in the dark and they got bitten and
scratched until they were glad to come out tail-first.
     "but they didn't go away: they sat outside and waited. whenever any of the
rabbits tried to silflay they found their enemies ready to jump on them. king
darzin and his soldiers couldn't watch all the holes -- there were too many -- but
they were quick enough to dash off wherever they saw a rabbit show his nose.
very soon el-ahrair

ah's people found that it was all they could do to snatch a
mouthful or two of grass -- just enough to keep alive -- before they had to bolt
underground again. el-ahrairah tried every trick he could think of, but he
couldn't be rid of king darzin or get his own people away. the rabbits began to
become thin and miserable underground and some of them fell ill.
     "at last el-ahrairah felt quite desperate and one night, when he had been

risking his life again and again to bring down a few mouthfuls of grass for a doe
and her family whose father had been killed the day before, he called out, 'lord
frith! i would do anything to save my people! i would drive a bargain with a stoat
or a fox -- yes, or with the black rabbit of inlé!'
     "now, as soon as he had said this, el-ahrairah realized in his heart that if there
was one creature anywhere who might have the will and cer

tainly had the power
to destroy his enemies, it was the black rabbit of inlé. for he was a rabbit, and
yet more powerful than king darzin a thousand times over. but the thought made
el-ahrairah sweat and shudder, so that he had to crouch down where he was in
the run. after a time he went to his own burrow and began to think of what he
had said and what it meant.
     "now, as you all know, the black rabbit of inlé is fear and everlasting
darkness. he is a rabbit, but he is that cold, bad dream from which we can only
entreat lord frith to save us today and tomorrow. when the snare is set in the
gap, the black rabbit knows where the peg is driven; and when the weasel
dances, the black

 or another. if that were
so, we would all be destroyed in a day. we go by the will of the black rabbit of
inlé and only by his will. and though that will seems hard and bitter to us all, yet
in his way he is our protector, for he knows frith's promise to the rabbits and he
will avenge any rabbit who may chance to be destroyed without the consent of
himself. anyone who has seen a gamekeeper's gibbet knows what the black
rabbit can bring down on elil who think they will do what they will.
     "el-ahrairah spent the night alone in his burrow and his thoughts were
terrible. as far as he knew, no rabbit had ever tried to do what he had in mind.
but the more he thought about it -- as well as he could for hunger and fear and
the trance that comes upon rabbits face to face with death -- the more it seemed
to him that there was at least a chance of success. he would seek out the black
rabbit and offer him his own life in return for the safety of his people. but if,
when he offered his life, he did not

d, it would be
better not to go near the black rabbit at all. the black rabbit might not accept
his life: yet still, perhaps, he might get a chance to try something else. only, there
could be no cheating the black rabbit. if his people's safety were to be had, by
whatever means, the price would be his life. so unless he failed, he would not
return. he would therefore need a companion to bring back whatever it was that
was going to overthrow king darzin and save the warren.
     "in the morning, el-ahrairah went to find rabscuttle and they talked far into
the day. then he called his owsla together and told them what he meant to do.

     "later that evening, in the last of the twilight, the rabbits came out and
attacked king darzin's soldiers. they fought very bravely and some of them were
killed. the enemy thought they were trying to break out of the warren and did
everything they could to surround them and force them back into their holes. but
the truth was that all the fighting was simply to d

istract king darzin's attention
and keep his soldiers busy. as darkness set in, el-ahrairah and rabscuttle slipped
out from the other end of the warren and made off down the ditch, while the
owsla fell back and king darzin's soldiers jeered at them down the holes. as for
king darzin, he sent a message to say that he was ready to talk to el-ahrairah
about terms of surrender.
     "el-ahrairah and rabscuttle set out on their dark journey. what way they went
i don't know and no rabbit knows. but i always remember what old feverfew --
d'you remember him? -- used to say when he told this story. 'they didn't take
long,' he said. 'they took no time at all. no. they limped and stumbled through a
bad dream to that terrible place they were bound for. where they were traveling,
the sun and moon mean nothing and winter and summer less. but you will never

neither do i, how far el-ahrairah went on his journey into the dark. you see the
top of a great stone sticking out of the ground. how far is it to the middle? split
the stone. then you'll know.'
     "at last they came to a high place where there was no grass. they scrambled
upward, over splinters of slate, among gray rocks bigger than sheep. mist and icy
rain swirled about them and there was no sound but the trickling of water and
sometimes, from far above, the cry of some great, evil bird on the wing. and these
sounds echoed,

 for they were between black cliffs of stone, taller than the tallest
trees. the snow lay in patches all about, for the sun never shone to melt it. the
moss was slippery, and whenever they pushed out a pebble, it rattled down and
down behind them in the gullies. but el-ahrairah knew the way and on he went,
until the mist grew so thick that they could see nothing. then they kept close to
the cliff and little by little, as they went, it overhung them until it made a dark
roof above their backs. where the cliff ended was the mouth of a tunnel, like a
huge rabbit hole. in the freezing cold and silence, el-ahrairah stamped and
flashed his tail to rabscuttle. and then, as they were about to go into the tunnel,
they realized that what they had thought, in the gloom, to be a

turned to make sure of the direction they had taken and as he did so dandelion
hesitated, uncertain whether to resume.
     "go on," said bigwig, "and don't leave anything out."

     "i think many things are left out, if only the truth could be known," said
dandelion, "for no one can say what happens in that country where el-ahrairah
went of his own accord and we do not. but, as i was told, when they first became
aware of the black rabbit, they fled down the tunnel -- as needs they must, for
there was nowhere else to run. and this they did although they had come on
purpose to encounter him and all depended on their doing so. they did no
differently from all of us; and the end, too, was no different, for when they had
done slipping and tripping and falling along the tunnel, they found themselves in
a vast stone burrow. all w

as of stone: the black rabbit had dug it out of the
mountain with his claws. and there they found, waiting for them, him from
whom they had fled. there were others in that burrow also -- shadows without
sound or smell. the black rabbit has his owsla, too, you know. i would not care
to meet them.
     "the black rabbit spoke with the voice of water that falls into pools in echoing
places in the dark.
     "'el-ahrairah, why have you come here?'
     "'i have come for my people,' whispered el-ahrairah.
     "the black rabbit smelled as clean as last year's bones and in the dark el-
ahrairah could see his eyes, for they were red with a light that gave no light.
     "'you are a stranger here, el-ahrairah,' said the black rabbit. 'you are alive.'
     "'my lord,' replied el-ahrairah, 'i have come to give you my life. my life for my
people.'
     "the black rabbit drew his claws along the floor.
     "'bargains, bargains, el-ahrairah,' he said. 'there is not a day or a night but a
doe offers he

r life for her kittens, or some honest captain of owsla his life for his
chief rabbit's. sometimes it is taken, sometimes it is not. but there is no bargain,
for here what is is what must be.'
     "el-ahrairah was silent. but he thought, 'perhaps i can trick him into taking
my life. he would keep a promise, as prince rainbow kept his.'
     "'you are my guest, el-ahrairah,' said the black rabbit. 'stay in my burrow as
long as you wish. you may sleep here. and you may eat here, and they are few
indeed who can do as much. let him eat,' he said to the owsla.
     "'we will not eat, my lord,' said el-ahrairah, for he knew that if he ate the food
which they gave him in that burrow, his secret thoughts would become plain and
there would be an end of tricks.
     "'then at least we must entertain you,' said the black rabbit. 'you must feel at
home, el-ahrairah, and mak

e yourself comfortable. come, let us play bob-
stones.'*
     "'very well,' said el-ahrairah, 'and if i win, my lord, perhaps you will be so
good as to accept my life in return for my people's safety.'
     "'i will,' said the black rabbit. 'but if i win, el-ahrairah, you shall give me both
your tail and your whiskers.'
     "the stones were brought and el-ahrairah sat down in the cold and the echoes
to play against the black rabbit of inlé. now, as you may suppose, el-ahrairah
knew how to play bob-stones. he could play as well as any rabbit that ever
covered a cast. but there -- in that dreadful place, with the black rabbit's eyes
upon him and the owsla who made no sound -- try as he would, his wits deserted

him and even before he cast, he felt that the black rabbit knew what was down.
the black rabbit showed never the least haste. he played as the snow falls,
without sound or change, until at last el-ahrairah's spirit failed him and he knew
that he could not win.

     "'you can pay your stakes to the owsla, el-ahrairah,' said the black rabbit,
'and they will show you a burrow to sleep in. i shall return tomorrow and if you
are still here i will see you. but you are free to leave whenever you wish.'
     "then the owsla took el-ahrairah away and cut off his tail and pulled out his
whiskers; and when he came to himself, he was alone with rabscuttle in a hollow
stone burrow, with an opening to the mountain outside.
     "'oh, master,' said rabscuttle, 'what will you do now? for frith's sake let us go
away. i can feel for both of us in the dark.'
     "'certainly not,' said el-ahrairah. he still hoped to get what he wanted from
the black rabbit somehow and he felt sure that they had been put into this
burrow so that they would be

 tempted to steal away. 'certainly not. i can make do
very well with some willow herb and clematis. go out and get some, rabscuttle,
but make sure you come back before tomorrow evening. you had better try to
bring some food, too, if you can.'
     "rabscuttle went out as he was told and el-ahrairah was left alone. he slept
very little, partly for the pain and partly for the fear that never left him; but
chiefly because he was still searching for some trick that would serve his turn. the
next day rabscuttle returned with some pieces of turnip, and after el-ahrairah
had eaten them, rabscuttle helped him to patch himself up with a gray tail and
whiskers made from the winter drift of clematis and ragwort. in the evening he
went to meet the black rabbit as though nothing had happened.

and down when he sniffed, but thrust it forward, as a dog does -- 'my burrow

yourself comfortable?'
     "'i have, my lord,' said el-ahrairah. 'i am glad that you allow me to stay.'
     "'perhaps we will not play bob-stones tonight,' said the black rabbit. 'you
must understand, el-ahrairah, that i have no wish to make you suffer. i am not
one of the thousand. i repeat, you may stay or leave as you please. but if you are
going to remain, perhaps you would care to hear a story; and to tell one yourself,
if you like.'
     "'certainly, my lord,' said el-ahrairah. 'and if i can tell a story as good as
yours, perhaps you will accept my life and grant the safety of my people.'
     "'i will,' said the black rabbit. 'but if not, el-ahrairah, you will have to forfeit
your ears.' he waite

did not.
     "then the black rabbit told such a tale of fear and darkness as froze the hearts
of rabscuttle and el-ahrairah where they crouched on the rock, for they knew
that every word was true. their wits turned. they seemed to be plunged in icy
clouds that numbed their senses; and the black rabbit's story crept into their
hearts like a worm into a nut, leaving them shriveled and empty. when at last
that terrible story was ended, el-ahrairah tried to speak. but he could not collect
his thoughts and he stammered and ran about the floor, like a mouse when the

hawk glides low. the black rabbit waited silently, with no sign of impatience. at
last it was clear that there would be no story from el-ahrairah, and the owsla
took him and put him into a deep sleep: and when he woke, his ears were gone
and only rabscuttle was beside him in the stone burrow, crying like a kitten.
     "'oh, master,' said rabscuttle, 'what good can this suffer

sake of lord frith and the green grass, let me take you home.'

they will do very well for ears.'
     "'they will wither, master,' said rabscuttle, 'and i am withered now.'
     "'they will last long enough,' said el-ahrairah grimly, for what i have to do. but
i cannot find the way.'
     "when rabscuttle was gone, el-ahrairah forced himself to think clearly. the
black rabbit would not accept his life. also, it was plain that he himself would
never be able to win any sort of wager against him: he might as well try to run a
race across a sheet of ice. but if the black rabbit did not hate him, why did he
inflict these sufferings upon him? to destroy his courage and make him give up
and go away. but why not simply send him away? and why wait, before hurting
him, till he himself proposed a wager and lost it? the answer c

suddenly. these shadows had no power either to send him away or to hurt him,
except with his own consent. they would not help him, no. they would seek
possession of his will and break it if they could. but supposing that he could find
among them something that would save his people, could they stop him from
taking it away?
     "when rabscuttle came back, he helped el-ahrairah to diguise his horrible,
maimed head with two dock leaves in place of ears, and after a while they slept.
but el-ahrairah kept dreaming of his starving rabbits waiting in the runs to push
back king darzin's soldiers and placing all their hopes on him: and at last he
woke, cold and cramped, and wandered out into the runs of the stone warren. as
he limped along, trailing the dock leaves on either side of his head -- for he could
not raise or move them like the ears he had lost -- he came to a pla

ce from which
several narrow runs led down deeper into the ground; and here he found two of
the ghastly, shadowy owsla moving about some dark business of their own. they
turned and stared, to make him afraid, but el-ahrairah was past being afraid and
he stared back at them, wondering what they had in mind to persuade him to
lose.
     "'turn back, el-ahrairah,' said one at last. 'you have no business here, in the
pit. you are alive; and have suffered much already.'
     "'not as much as my people,' replied el-ahrairah.
     "'there is enough suffering here for a thousand warrens,' said the shadow. 'do
not be stubborn, el-ahrairah. in these holes lie all the plagues and diseases that
come to rabbits -- fever and mange and the sickness of the bowels. and here, too,
in this nearest hole, lies the white blindness, that sends creatures hobbling out to

task, to see that all these are ready for the use of inlé-rah. for what is is what
must be.'
     "then el-ahrairah knew that he must give himself no time to think. he
pretended to go back, but suddenly turned, rushed upon the shadows and

plunged into the nearest hole faster than a raindrop into the ground. and there he
lay, while the shadows flickered and gibbered about the entrance, for they had no
power to move him, except by fear. after a time they went away and el-ahrairah
was left alone, wondering whether he would be able to reach king darzin's army
in time without the use of whiskers or ears.
     "

at last, when he was sure that he must have stayed in the hole long enough to
be infected, el-ahrairah came out and began to make his way back along the run.
he did not know how soon the disease would appear or how long he would take
to die, but plainly he ought to return as quickly as he could -- if possible, before
there was any sign of illness on him. without going near rabscuttle, he must tell
him to hurry ahead, reach the rabbits in the warren and warn them to block all
the holes and stay inside until king darzin's army was destroyed.
     "he blundered into a stone in the dark, for he was

shivering and feverish and
in any case he could feel little or nothing without his whiskers. at that moment a
quiet voice said, 'el-ahrairah, where are you going?' he had heard nothing, but he
knew that the black rabbit was beside him.
     "'i am going home, my lord,' he replied. 'you said that i might go when i
wished.'
     "'you have some purpose, el-ahrairah,' said the black rabbit. 'what is it?'
     "'i have been in the pit, my lord,' answered el-ahrairah. 'i am infected with the
white blindness and i am going to save my people by destroying the enemy.'
     "'el-ahrairah,' said the black rabbit, 'do you know how the white blindness is
carried?'
     "a sudden misgiving seized upon el-ahrairah. he said nothing.
     "'it is carried by the fleas in rabbits' ears, said the black rabbit. 'they pass
from the ears of a sick rabbit to those of his companions. but, el-ahrairah, you
have no ears and fleas will not go to dock leaves. you can neither catc

     "then at last el-ahrairah felt that his strength and courage were gone. he fell
to the ground. he tried to move, but his back legs dragged along the rock and he
could not get up. he scuffled and then lay still in the silence.
     "'el-ahrairah,' said the black rabbit at last, 'this is a cold warren: a bad place
for the living and no place at all for warm hearts and brave spirits. you are a
nuisance to me. go home. i myself will save your people. do not have the
impertinence to ask me when. there is no time here. they are already saved.'
     "in that moment, while king darzin and his soldiers were still jeering down the
holes of the warren, confusion and terror came upon them in the falling darkness.
the fields seemed full of huge ra

they turned and fled. they vanished in the night; and that is why no rabbit who
tells the tales of el-ahrairah can say what kind of creatures they were or what they
looked like. not one of them has ever been seen, from that day to this.
     "when at last el-ahrairah was able to rise to his feet, the black rabbit was
gone and rabscuttle was coming down the run, looking for him. together they
went out to the mountainside and made their way down the stone-rattling gully
in the mist. they did not know where they were going, except that they were
going away from the black rabbit's warren. but after a time it became plain that
el-ahrairah was ill from shock and exhaustion. rabscuttle dug a scrape and there

they stayed for several days.
     "later, when el-ahr
 
 ___________________________
 
h began to get better, they wandered on, but they could
not find their way back. they were confused in their wits and had to beg help and
shelter of other animals whom they met. their journey home lasted three
months, and many adventures they had. some these, as you know, are stories in
themselves. once they lived with a lendri and found pheasants' eggs for him in
the wood. and once they barely escaped from the middle of a hayfield when the
hay was cutting. all the time, rabscuttle looked after el-ahrairah, brought him
fresh dock leaves and kept the flies from his wounds until they healed.
     "at last, one day, they came back to the warren. it was evening, and as the sun
stretched out all the hills, they could see any number of rabbits at silflay, nibbling
in the grass and playing over the ant heaps. they stopped at the top of the field,
sniffing the gorse and herb robert on the wind.
     "'well, they look all right,' said el-ahrairah. 'a healthy lot, really. let's just slip

and see if i can find captain loosestrife for you. i don't actually know him myself,

but then it's rather a big warren.'
     "'that's good of you,' said el-ahrairah, 'but i think i've got my bearings now
and i can manage by myself.'
     "el-ahrairah went along the hedgerow to the wood and sat alone under a nut
bush, looking out across the fields. as the light began to fail, he suddenly realized
that lord frith was close beside him, among the leaves.
     "'are you angry, el-ahrair

ah?' asked lord frith.
     "'no, my lord,' replied el-ahrairah, 'i am not angry. but i have learned that
with creatures one loves, suffering is not the only thing for which one may pity
them. a rabbit who does not know when a gift has made him safe is poorer than a
slug, even though he may think otherwise himself.'
     "'wisdom is found on the desolate hillside, el-ahrairah, where none comes to
feed, and the stony bank where the rabbit scratches a hole in vain. but, speaking
of gifts, i have brought a few trifles for you. a pair of ears, tail and some whiskers.
you may find the ears slightly strange at first. i put a little starlight in them, but it
is really quite faint: not enough, i am sure, to give away a clever thief like you. ah,

     "i'm afraid i just lost my head, hazel," replied bigwig. "i've been strung up all
day, thinking about this business at efrafa -- got me really on edge. when i feel
like that i have to do something -- you know, fight or run a risk. i thought if i

open mouth, pure white inside. rhythmically, without haste, it sucked down a
floating sedge fly and sank back under water. a ripple spread outward in
subsiding circles, breaking both the reflections and the transparency. gradually
the stream grew smooth and once more they saw the fish below them, waving its
tail as it held its place in the current.
     "a water hawk!" said fiver. "so they hunt and eat down there, too! don't fall

had finished. "it may be too thick."
     they went back to the punt.
     "no, it's not," said hazel, "and it's stretched tight, of course, which makes it
much easier to gnaw. i can gnaw that, all right."
     "ya, ees goot," said kehaar. "you go fine. but you do heem queek, ya? maybe

     "there's nothing more to wait for," said hazel. "go on, bigwig, straightaway,

word by kehaar what you want us to do; we shall all be here, ready to back you
up."
     afterward, they all remembered how bigwig had taken his orders. no one
could say that he did not practice what he preached. he hesitated a few moments
and then looked squarely at hazel.
     "it's sudden," he said. "i wasn't expecting it tonight. but that's all to the good --
i hated waiting. see you later."
     he touched his nose to hazel's, turned a

two. now i'm frightened and i feel the council are always watching."
     "yes, but i'm here now," said bigwig.
     "the council are very cunning."
     "they'll need to be. we've got some rabbits who are far more cunning, believe
me. el-ahrairah's owsla, no less. but tell me -- was nelthilta with you when you
went to the council?"
     "oh, no, she was born here, in the near hind. she's got spirit, you know, but
she's young and silly. it excites her to let everyone see that she's a friend of
rabbits who are thought of as rebels. she doesn't realize what she's doing or what
the council are really like. it's all a kind of game to her -- to cheek the officers and

must say i'm looking forward to that."
     she said nothing and he added, "you must trust me, hyzenthlay. upon my life,
we're going to vanish. i'm not deceiving you."
     "if you were wrong, those who died quickly would be the lucky ones."
     "no one's going to die. my friends have prepared a trick that el-ahrairah
himself would be proud of."
     "if it is to be at sunset," she said, "it must be tomorrow or the next night. in
two days the mark loses the evening silflay. you know that?"
     "yes, i'd heard. tomorrow, then. why wait longer? but there is one other
thing. we're going to take blackavar."
     "blackavar? how? he is guarded by council police."

     during the early afternoon they began to approach the belt and bigwig was the
first to recognize the place where dandelion had told the story of the black rabbit
of inlé.
     "it was the same fox, you know," he said to hazel. "that's almost certain. i
ought to have realized how likely it was that--"
     "look here," said hazel, "you know very well what we owe to you. the does all
think el-ahrairah sent you to get them out of efrafa. they believe no one else
could have done it. as for what happened this morning, it was my fault as much
as yours. but i never supposed we would get home without losing some rabbits.
in fact we've lost two and that's better than i expected. we can get back to the
honeycomb tonight if we press on. let's forget about the homba now, bigwig -- it
can't be altered -- and try to -- hello, who's this?"
     they were coming to a thicket of juniper and dog roses, tang

h, you mean 'woundwort dismayed,'" said dandelion. "that's bigwig's story
-- i wouldn't presume to tell it. but it makes a change to be thinking about winter
on an evening like this. it reminds me of a story i've listened to but never tried to
tell myself. so some of you may know it and perhaps some won't. it's the story of
rowsby woof and the fairy wogdog."
     "off you go," said fiver, "and lay it on thick."

     "there was a big rabbit," said dandelion. "there was a small rabbit. there was
el-ahrairah; and he had the frost in his fine new whiskers. the earth up and down
the runs of the warren was so hard that you could cut your paws on it, and the
robins answered each other across the bare, still copses, 'this is my bit here. you
go and starve in your own.'
     "one evening, when frith was sinking huge and red in a green sky, el-ahrairah
and rabscuttle limped trembling through the frozen grass, picking a bite here and
there to carry them on for another long night underground. the grass was

in a way and slip across the fields to the edge of the village, where there was a big

vegetable garden.
     "this particular garden was bigger than any of the others round about. the
man who worked in it lived in a house at one end and he used to dig or cut great
quantities of vegetables, put them into a hrududu and drive them away. he had
put wire all round the garden to keep rabbits out. all the same, el-ahrairah could
usually find a way in if he wanted to; but it was dangerous, because the man had a
gun and often shot jays and pigeons and hung them up.
     "'it isn't only the gun we'd be risking, either,' said el-ahrairah, thinking it over.
'we'd have to keep an eye open for that confounded rowsby woof as well.'
     "now, rowsby woof was the man's dog; and he was the most objectionable,
malicious, disgusting brute that ever licked a man's hand. he was a big, woolly
sort of animal with hair all over h

l of his so often and showed him off so much that he had
become revoltingly conceited. he believed himself to be the finest ratter in the
world. he ate a lot of raw meat (but not in the evening, because he was left
hungry at night to keep him active) and this made it rather easier to smell him
coming. but even so, he made the garden a dangerous place.
     "'well, let's chance rowsby woof for once,' said rabscuttle. 'i reckon you and i
ought to be able to give him the slip if we have to.'
     "el-ahrairah and rabscuttle made their way across the fields to the outskirts of
the garden. when they got there, the first thing they saw was the man himself,
with a white stick burning away in his mouth, cutting row after row of frosted
cabbages. rowsby woof was with him, wagging his tail and jumping about in a
ridiculous manner. after a time the man piled as many of the cabbages as he
could into a wheel thing and pushed them away to the house. he came back
several times and when he had taken all the cabb

began carrying them inside.
     "'what's he doing that for?' asked rabscuttle.
     "'i suppose he wants to get the frost out of them tonight,' replied el-ahrairah,
'before he takes them away in the hrududu tomorrow.'
     "'they'd be much better to eat with the frost out of them, wouldn't they?' said
rabscuttle. 'i wish we could get at them while they're in there. still, never mind.
now's our chance. let's see what we can do up this end of the garden while he's
busy down there.'
     "but hardly had they crossed the top of the garden and got among the cabbages
than rowsby woof had winded them and down he came, barking and yelping,
and they were lucky to

get out in time.

     "'dirty little beasts,' shouted rowsby woof. 'how--how! how--how dare you
come snou--snou--snouting round here? get out -- out! out -- out!'
     "'contemptible brute!' said el-ahrairah, as they scurried back to the warren
with nothing to show for all their trouble. 'he's really annoyed me. i don't know
yet how it's going to be done, but, by frith and inlé, before this frost thaws, we'll
eat his cabbages inside the house and make him look a fool into the bargain!'
     "'that's saying too much, master,' said rabscuttle. 'a pity to throw your life
away for a cabbage, after all we've done together.'
     "'well, i shall be watching my chance,' said el-ahrairah. 'i shall just be

doors had somehow come open and were swinging about as the hrududu went
along. there were things inside wrapped up in bags like the ones men sometimes
leave about the fields; and as the hrududu passed rabscuttle, one of these bags
fell out into the lane. when the hrududu had gone rabscuttle, who hoped that the
bag might have something to eat inside, slipped down into the lane to have a sniff
at it. but he was disappointed to find that all it contained was some kind of meat.
later he told el-ahrairah about his disappointment.
     "'meat?' said el-ahrairah. 'is it still there?'
     "'how should i know?' said rabscuttle. 'beastly stuff.'
     "'come with me,' said el-ahrairah. 'quickly, too.'
     "when they got to the lane the meat was still there. el-ahrairah dragged the
bag into the ditch and they buried it.
     "'but what good will this be to us, master?' said rabscuttle.
     "'i don't know yet,' said el-ahrairah. 'but some good it will surely be, if the rats
don't get it. come home n

ow, though. it's getting dark.'
     "as they were going home, they came on an old black wheel-covering thrown
away from a hrududu, lying in the ditch. if you've ever seen these things, you'll
know that they're something like a huge fungus -- smooth and very strong, but
pad-like and yielding too. they smell unpleasant, and are no good to eat.
     "'come on,' said el-ahrairah immediately. 'we have to gnaw off a good chunk
of this. i need it.'
     "rabscuttle wondered whether his master was going mad, but he did as he was
told. the stuff had grown fairly rotten and before long they were able to gnaw off
a lump about as big as a rabbits head. it tasted dreadful, but el-ahrairah carried it
carefully back to the warren. he spent a lot of time that night nibbling at it and
after morning silflay the next day he continued. about ni-frith he woke

outside and put the lump in front of him.
     "'what does that look like?' he said. 'never mind the smell. what does it look
like?'
     "rabscuttle looked at it. 'it looks rather like a dog's black nose, master,' he
answered, 'except that it's dry.'
     "'splendid,' said el-ahrairah, and went to sleep.
     "it was still frosty -- very clear and cold -- that night, with half a moon, but fu

rabscuttle to come with him. el-ahrairah carried the black nose himself and on

     "well, never mind," said hazel. "go on with the story."
     "in the end," continued dandelion, "rabscuttle kept well away from him, but
el-ahrairah held his breath and still carried the nose somehow, until they got to
the place where they had buried the meat.
     "'dig it up,' said el-ahrairah. 'come on.'
     "they dug it up

and the paper came off. the meat was all bits joined together
in a kind of trail like a spray of bryony, and poor rabscuttle was told to drag it
along to the bottom of the vegetable garden. it was hard work and he was glad
when he was able to drop it.
     "'now,' said el-ahrairah, 'we'll go round to the front.'
     "when they got to the front, they could tell that the man had gone out. for one
thing, the house was all dark but, besides, they could smell that he had been
through the gate a little while before. the front of the house had a flower garden
and this was separated from the back and the vegetable garden by a high, close-
boarded fence that ran right across and ended in a big clump of laurels. just the
other side of the fence was the back door that led into the

 kitchen.
     "el-ahrairah and rabscuttle went quietly through the front garden and peeped
through a crack in the fence. rowsby woof was sitting on the gravel path, wide
awake and shivering in the cold. he was so near that they could see his eyes blink
in the moonlight. the kitchen door was shut, but nearby, along the wall, there
was a hole above the drain where a brick had been left out. the kitchen floor was
made of bricks and the man used to wash it with a rough broom and sweep the
water out through the hole. the hole

 was plugged up with an old cloth to keep out
the cold.
     "after a little while el-ahrairah said in a low voice,
     "'rowsby woof! o rowsby woof!'
     "rowsby woof sat up and looked about him, bristling.
     "'who's there?' he said. 'who are you?'
     "'o rowsby woof!' said el-ahrairah, crouching on the other side of the fence.
'most fortunate, most blessed rowsby woof! your reward is at hand! i bring you
the best news in the world!'
     "'what?' said rowsby woof. 'who's that? none of your tricks, now!'

     "rowsby woof got to his feet and looked about in silence. he could not tell
what to make of the voice, but he was suspicious.
     "'your fame as a ratter has come to the ears of the queen,' said el-ahrairah.
'we know you -- and honor you -- as the greatest ratter in the world. that is why i
am here. but poor, bewildered creature! i see you are perplexed, and well you
may be. come here, rowsby woof! come close to the fence and know me better!'
     "rowsby woof came up to the fence and el-ahrairah pushed the rubber nose

into the crack and moved it about. rowsby woof stood close, sniffing.
     "'noble rat-catcher,' whispered el-ahrairah, 'it is indeed i, the fairy wogdog,
sent to honor you!'

 "'oh, fairy wogdog!' cried rowsby woof, dribbling and piddling all over the
gravel. 'ah, what elegance! what aristocratic distinction! can that really be
decayed cat that i smell? with a delicate overtone of rotten camel! ah, the
gorgeous east!'
     ("what on earth's 'camel'?" said bigwig.
     "i don't know," replied dandelion. "but it was in the story when i heard it, so i
suppose it's some creature or other.")
     "'happy, happy dog!' said el-ahrairah. 'i must tell you that queen dripslobber
her very self has expressed her gracious wish that you should meet her. but not
yet, rowsby woof, not yet. first you must be found worthy. i am sent to bring
you both a test and a proof. listen, rowsby woof. beyond the far end of the
garden there lies a long rope of meat. aye, real meat, rowsby woof, for though
we are fairy dogs, yet we bring real gifts to noble, brave animals such as you. go
now -- find and eat that meat. trust me, for i will guard the

     "rowsby woof was desperately hungry and the cold had got into his stomach,
but still he hesitated. he knew that his master expected him to guard the house.
     "'ah, well,' said el-ahrairah, 'never mind. i will depart. in the next village there
lives a dog--'
     "'no, no,' cried rowsby woof. 'no, fairy wogdog, do not leave me! i trust you!
i will go at once! only guard the house and do not fail me!'
     "'have no fear, noble hound,' said el-ahrairah. 'only trust the word of the great
queen.'
     "rowsby woof went bounding away in the moonlight and el-ahrairah watched
him out of sight.
     "'are we to go into the house now, master?' asked rabscuttle. 'we shall have to

     "'certainly not,' said el-ahrairah. 'how could you suggest such double-dealing?

     "they waited silently and after a while rowsby woof returned, licking his lips
and grinning. he came sniffing up to the fence.
     "'i perceive, honest friend,' said el-ahrairah, 'that you found the meat as swiftly
as though it had been a rat. the house is safe and all is well. now hark. i shall
return to the queen and tell her of all that has passed. it was her gracious
purpose that if you showed yourself worthy tonight, by trusting her messenger,

show myself a true dog!'
     "'i do not doubt it,' said el-ahrairah. 'and now, farewell. be patient and await

     "he withdrew the rubber nose and very quietly they crept away.
     "the following night was, if anything, still colder. even el-ahrairah had to pull
himself together before he could set out over the fields. they had hidden the
rubber nose outside the garden and it took them some time to get it ready for
rowsby woof. when they had made sure that the man had gone out, they went
cautiously into the front garden and up to the fence. rows

el-ahrairah spoke, he put his head on the ground between his front paws and
whined for joy.

'with her noble attendants, the fairies postwiddle and sniffbottom. and this is her
wish. you know the crossroads in the village, do you not?'
     "'yes, yes!' whined rowsby woof. 'yes, yes! oh, let me show how abject i can
be, dear fairy wogdog. i will--'
     "'very well,' said el-ahrairah. 'now, o fortunate dog, go to the crossroads and
await the queen. she is coming on the wings of night. it is far that she must come,
but wait patiently. only wait. do not fail her and

     "'quite right, most excellent,' said el-ahrairah. 'only make haste.'
     "as soon as rowsby woof had gone, el-ahrairah and rabscuttle went quickly
through the laurels, round the end of the fence and along to the back door. el-
ahrairah pulled the cloth out of the hole above the drain with his teeth and led the
way into the kitchen.
     "the kitchen was as warm as this bank and at one end was a great pile of
vegetables ready for the hrududu in the morning -- cabbages, brussels sprouts
and parsnips. they were thawed out and the delicious smell was quite
overpowering. el-ahrairah and rabscuttle began at once to m

will be to the queen for keeping him waiting. he will be able to show her the full
extent of his loyalty, won't he? have another parsnip, rabscuttle.'
     "meanwhile, down at the crossroads, rowsby woof waited eagerly in the frost,
listening for the coming of queen dripslobber. after a long time he heard
footsteps. they were not the steps of a dog but of a man. as they came near, he
realized that they were the steps of his own master. he was too stupid to

     "'why, rowsby woof,' said his master, 'what are you doing here?'
     "rowsby woof looked foolish and nosed about. his master was puzzled. then
a thought came to him.
     "'why, good old chap,' he said, 'you came to meet me, did you? good fellow,
then! come on, we'll go home together.'
     "rowsby woof tried to slip away, but his master grabbed him by the collar, tied
him by a bit of string he had in his pocket and led him home.
     "their arrival took el-ahrairah by surprise. it fact, he was so busy stuffing

cabbage that he heard nothing until the doorhandle rattled. he and rabscuttle
had only just time to slip behind a pile of baskets before the man came in, leading
rowsby woof. rowsby woof was quiet and dejected and did not even notice the
smell of rabbit, which anyway was all mixed up with the smell of the fire and the
larder. he lay on the mat while the man made some sort of drink for himself.

t a white stick, suddenly looked
round and got up. he had noticed the draft coming in through the open hole. to
the rabbits' horror, he picked up a sack and plugged the hole up very tightly
indeed. then he finished his drink, made up the fire and went away to sleep,
leaving rowsby woof shut in the kitchen. evidently he thought it too cold to turn
him out for the night.
     "at first rowsby woof whined and scratched at the door, but after a time he
came back to the mat by the fire and lay down. el-ahrairah moved very quietly
along the wall until he was behind a big metal box in the corner under the sink.
there were sacks and old papers here, too, and he felt fairly sure that rowsby
woof could not manage to see behind it. as soon as rabscuttle had joined him, he
spoke.
     "'o rowsby woof!' whispered el-ahrairah.
     "rowsby woof was up in a flash.
     "'fairy wogdog!' he cried. 'is that you i hear?'
     "'it is indeed,' said el-ahrairah. 'i am sorry for your disappointment, rowsby

     "'alas, no,' said rowsby woof: and he told what had happened at the
crossroads.
     "'never mind,' said el-ahrairah. do not be downhearted, rowsby woof. there
was good reason why the queen did not come. she received news of danger -- ah,
great danger, rowsby woof! -- and avoided it in time. i myself am here at the risk
of my own safety to warn you. you are lucky indeed that i am your friend, for
otherwise your good master must have been stricken with mortal plague.'

     "'oh, horror!' cried rowsby woof. 'there is no time to be lost! what must i do,
fairy wogdog?'
     "'the sickness works by a spell,' said el-ahrairah. 'but if a real dog of flesh and
blood could run four times round the house, barking as loudly as he could, then
the spell would be broken and the sickness would have no power. but alas! i
forgot! you are shut in, rowsby woof. what is to be done? i fear that all is lost!'

n upstairs, shouting and cursing. still rowsby woof barked. the man came
stamping down. he flung open the window and listened for thieves, but he could
hear nothing, partly because there was nothing to hear and partly because of the
ceaseless barking. at last he picked up his gun, flung open the door and went
cautiously out to see what was the matter. out shot rowsby woof, bellowing like
a bull, and tore around the house. the man followed him at a run, leaving the
door wide.
     "'quick!' said el-ahrairah. 'quicker than wogdog from the tartar's bow! come
on!'
     "el-ahrairah and rabscuttle dashed into the garden and disappeared through
the laurels. in the field beyond they paused for a moment. from behind came the
sounds of yelping and woofing, mixed with shouts and angry cries of 'come 'ere,
damn you!'
     "'noble fellow,' said el-ahrairah. 'he has saved his master, rabscuttle. he has
saved us all. let us go home and sleep sound in our burrow.'

what happened at nutley copse. it would be better to go now."
     "well, go on, then," answered hazel. "i'm not stopping you. and i'm not
leaving this warren. it's my home." he looked at hyzenthlay, heavy with young,
who was sitting in the mouth of the nearest hole and listening to the talk. "how
far do you think she'll get? and clover -- do we leave her or what?"

this woundwort; and if he doesn't, i'm not going back to efrafa, i'll tell you that."
     "fill in the holes," said hazel.
     as the sun set, the rabbits fell to clawing and scrabbling in the runs. the sides
were hard with the hot weather. it was not easy to get started, and when the soil
began to fall, it was light and powdery and did little to block the holes. it was

     the lame rabbit seemed about to reply, but woundwort had already turned
away and was explaining to campion what he was to do. neither of them
bothered to watch the lame rabbit as he limped back by the way he had come.

44.     a message from el-ahrairah

     the enforced passivity of their defence, the interminable waiting, became
insupportable. day and night they heard the muffled thud of the picks above and
dreamt of the collapse of the grotto and of every ghastly eventuality. they were
subject to "castle-mentality" in its most extreme form.

     "but hazel--" said blackberry.
     "as soon as we've gone," said hazel, turning to bigwig, "you're to block this run
and get everyone back behind the wall you've made. if they break in, hold them
up as long as you can. don't give in to them on any account. el-ahrairah has
shown me what to do."
     "but where are you going, hazel?" asked bigwig.
     "to the farm," said hazel, "to gnaw another rope. now, you two, follow me up
the run: and don't forget, you stop for nothing until you're down the hill. if there
are rabbits outside, don't fight -- run."
     without another word he dashed up the tunnel and out into the wood, with
blackberry and dandelion on his heels.

     it had occurred to bigwig that in the narrow run even his dead body would be a
considerable obstacle. the efrafans would either have to get it out or dig round it
and this would mean more delay. in the burrow behind him he could hear
bluebell, who was apparently telling the does a story. "good idea," he thought.
"keep 'em happy. more than i could do if i had to sit there."
     "so then el-ahrairah said to the fox, 'fox you may smell and fox you may be,
but i can tell your fortune in the water.'"
     suddenly woundwort spoke.
     "thlayli," he said, "why do you want to throw your life away? i can send one
fresh rabbit after another into this run if i choose. you're too good to be killed.
come back to efrafa. i promise i'll give you the command of any mark you like. i

     "very well," said woundwort. "but remember, thlayli, you yourself can stop
this nonsense whenever you wish."
     "'no,' replied el-ahrairah, 'it is not fat rabbits that i see in the water, but swift
hounds on the scent and my enemy flying for his life.'"
     bigwig realized that woundwort also knew that in the run his body would be
nearly as great a hindrance dead as alive. "he wants me to come out on my feet,"
he thought. "but it's inlé, not efrafa, that i shall go to from here."
     suddenly woundwort leaped forward in a single bound and landed full against

some of the other rabbits had had the same idea.

     they approached very quietly, upwind from the north. peeping over the edge,
they saw vilthuril and her litter of four lying in the sun. their mother was telling
the young rabbits a story.
     "so after they had swum the river," said vilthuril, "el-ahrairah led his people
on in the dark, through a wild, lonely place. some of them were afraid, but he
knew the way and in the morning he brought them safely to some green fields,
very beautiful, with good, sweet grass. and here they found a warren; a warren
that was bewitched. all the rabbits in this warren were in the power of a wicked
spell. they wore shining collars round their necks and sang like the birds and

become princes, too.'"
     vilthuril looked up and saw the newcomers. she paused for a moment and
then went on.
     "but frith came to rabscuttle in a dream and warned him that that warren was
enchanted. and he dug into the ground to find where the spell was buried. deep
he dug, and hard was the search, but at last he found that wicked spell and

pinned under his claws, and it turned into a great white bird which spoke to him
and blessed him."
     "i seem to know this story," whispered hazel, "but i can't remember where i've
heard it."
     bluebell sat up and scratched his neck with his hind leg. the little rabbits
turned round at the interruption and in a moment had tumbled up the side of the
hollow, squeaking "hazel-rah! hazel-rah!" and jumping on hazel from all sides.
