and for louise dennys, with thanks 
 
‘most of you, i am sure, remember the tragic circumstances of the death of geoffrey clifton at gilf kebir, followed later by 
the disappearance of his wife, katharine clifton, which took place during the 1939 desert expedition in search of zerzura. 
“i cannot begin this meeting tonight without referring very sympathetically to those tragic occurrences.

she reaches the last square. 

she  bends  down  and  picks  up  the  piece  of  metal,  pauses  in  that  position,  motionless,  her  skirt  still  tucked  up  above  her 

thighs, hands hanging down loose, breathing hard. she takes a gulp of air and blows out the candle. 

now she is in darkness. just a smell of smoke. 
she leaps up and in midair turns so she lands facing the other way, then skips forward even wilder now down the black hall, 
still landing on squares she knows are there, her tennis shoes banging and slamming onto the dark floor—so the sound echoes 
out into the far reaches of the deserted italian villa, out towards the moon and the scar of a ravine that half circles the building. 

 
sometimes at night the burned man hears a faint shudder in the building. he turns up his hearing aid to draw in a banging 

noise he still cannot interpret or place.

“yes, i knew her there.” 
they  pass  numerous  bonfires  on  the  sides  of  the  road  and  caravaggio  diverts  the  young  soldier’s  attention  to  them.  the 
sapper’s  nickname  is  kip.  “get  kip.”  “here  comes  kip.”  the  name  had  attached  itself  to  him  curiously.  in  his  first  bomb 
disposal report in england some butter had marked his paper, and the officer had exclaimed, “what’s this? kipper grease?” 
and laughter surrounded him. he had no idea what a kipper was, but the young sikh had been thereby translated into a salty 
english  fish.  within  a  week  his  real  name,  kirpal  singh,  had  been  forgotten.  he  hadn’t  minded  this.  lord

hung  over  the  rifle  that  rested  across  his  shoulders.  she  disliked  this  casual  handling  of  the  gun,  his  lazy  spin  towards  her 
entrance as if his body were the axle of a wheel, as if the weapon had been sewn along his shoulders and arms and into his 
small brown wrists. 

the englishman turned to her and said, “we’re getting along famously!” 
she  was put out that the sapper had strolled casually into this domain, seemed able to surround her, be everywhere. kip, 
hearing from caravaggio that the patient knew about guns, had begun to discuss the search for bombs with the englishman. he 
had come up to the room and found him a reservoir of information about allied and enemy weaponry. the englishman not 
only knew about the absurd italian fuzes but also  knew the detailed topography of this  region of tuscany. soon  they  were 
drawing outlines of bombs for each other and talking out the theory of each specific circuit.

energize the train of thought. the soldier rolled his head back and looked at the ceiling. 

“what we should do is make a sling,” the sapper mused, turning to hana as she entered, “and carry him around the house.” 

she looked at both of them, shrugged and walked out of the room. 

when caravaggio passed her in the hall she was smiling. they stood in the hall and listened to the conversation inside the 

room.

“i think he’s found a friend,” she said to caravaggio. 
 
she  walks out into the  sunlight and the courtyard. at  noon the taps deliver  water into the villa’s fountain and for twenty 

minutes it bursts forth. she removes her shoes, climbs into the dry bowl of the fountain and waits.

continue, never looking up until she herself was fatigued. if he had missed the last half-hour of plot, just one room would be 
dark  in  a  story  he  probably  already  knew.  he  was  familiar  with  the  map  of  the  story.  there  was  benares  to  the  east  and 
chilianwallah in the north of the punjab. (all this occurred before the sapper entered their lives, as if out of this fiction. as if 
the pages of kipling had been rubbed in the night like a magic lamp. a drug of wonders.) 

she had turned from the ending of kirn, with its delicate and holy sentences—and now clean diction—and picked up the 
patient’s notebook, the book he had somehow managed to carry with him out of the fire. the book splayed open, almost twice 
its original thickness. 

there was thin paper from a bible, torn out and glued into the text.

he had rambled on, driving them mad, traitor or ally, leaving them never quite sure who he was. 
now, months later in the villa san girolamo, in the hill town north of florence, in the arbour room that is his bedroom, he 
reposes like the sculpture of the dead knight in ravenna. he speaks in fragments about oasis towns, the later medicis, the prose 
style of kipling, the woman who bit into his flesh. and in his commonplace book, his 1890 edition of herodotus’ histories, 
are other fragments—maps, diary entries, writings in many languages, paragraphs cut out of other books. all that is missing is 
his own name. there is still no clue to who he actually is, nameless, without rank or battalion or squadron. the references in 
his book are all pre-war, the deserts of egypt and libya in the 19305, interspersed with references to cave art or gallery art o

it  is  almost  dark  in  the  green  room.  hana  turns  and  realizes  her  neck  is  stiff  from  stillness.  she  has  been  focused  and 
submerged within the crabbed handwriting in his thick-leaved sea-book of maps and texts. there is even a small fern glued 
into it. the histories. she doesn’t close the book, hasn’t touched it since she laid it on the side table. she walks away from it. 

 
kip  was in a field north of the villa  when  he found the large  mine, his foot—almost on the green  wire as he crossed the 
orchard—twisting  away,  so  he  lost  his  balance  and  was  on  his  knees.  he  lifted  the  wire  until  it  was  taut,  then  followed  it, 
zigzagging among the trees.

six black wires. when he was a child his father had bunched up his fingers and, disguising all but the tips of them, made him 
guess which was the long one. his own small finger would touch his choice, and his father’s hand would unfold, blossoming, 
to reveal the boy’s mistake. one could of course make a red wire negative. but this opponent had not just concreted the thing 
but painted all the characters black. kip was being pulled into a psychological vortex. with the knife he began to scrape the 
paint free, revealing a red, a blue, a green. would his opponent have also switched them? he’d have to set up a detour with 
black wire of his own like an oxbow river and then test the loop for positive or negative power. then he would check it for 
fading power and know where the danger lay.

“it’s okay.” 
“keep very still.” 
he opened up his satchel for the geiger counter and magnet. he ran the dial up and along the wires she was holding. no 

swerve to negative. no clue. nothing. he stepped backwards, wondering where the trick could be. 

“let me tape those to the tree, and you leave.” 
“no. i’ll hold it. they won’t reach the tree.” 
“no.” 
“kip—i can hold them.” 
“we have an impasse. there’s a joke. i don’t know where to go from here. i don’t know how complete the trick is.” 
leaving her, he ran back to where he had first sighted the wire. he raised it and followed it all the way this time, the geiger 
counter alongside it. then he was crouched about ten yards from her, thinking, now and then looking up, looking right through 
her, watching only the two tributaries of wire she held in her hands. i don’t know, he said o

they were shuffling together in the corridors towards the english patient’s bedroom, caravaggio carrying the gramophone, 

one hand holding its arm and needle. 

“now, before you begin on your histories,” he said to the static figure in the bed, “i will present you with ‘my romance.’ 
“written in 1935 by mr. lorenz hart, i believe,” muttered the englishman. kip was sitting at the window, and she said she 

wanted to dance with the sapper. 

“not until i’ve taught you, dear worm.” 
she looked up at caravaggio strangely; that was her father’s term of endearment for her. he pulled her into his thick grizzled 

embrace and said “dear worm” again, and began the dancing lesson. 

she had put on a clean but unironed dress. each time they spun she saw the sapper singing to himself, following the lyrics. if

 had a radio, they could have had news of the war somewhere. all they had was the 
crystal set belonging to kip, but he had courteously left it in his tent. the english patient was discussing the unfortunate life of 
lorenz hart. some of his best lyrics to “manhattan,” he claimed, had been changed and he now broke into those verses

when we’re in.

“why don’t you guess mine?” 
“i will when you know what to do. at present i’m the only one who does.” 
“i bet kip knows.” 
“he may know but he won’t do it.” 
“i shall have some wine,” the english patient said, and the sapper picked up a glass of water, flung the contents through the 

window and poured wine for the englishman. “this is my first drink in a year.” 

there was a muffled noise, and the sapper turned quickly and looked out of the window, into the darkness. the others froze.

“turn the record over, kip. now i will introduce you to ‘how long has this been going on,’ written by—” he left an 
opening for the english patient, who was stymied, shaking his head, grinning with the wine in his mouth. “this alcohol will 
probably kill me.” “nothing will kill you, my friend. you are pure carbon.” “caravaggio!”

her cheek rested against the muscles of caravaggio’s shoulder. she could feel those terrible paws on her back against the 
clean frock, and they moved in the limited space between the bed and the wall, between bed and door, between the bed and the 
window  alcove  that  kip  sat  within.  every  now  and  then  as  they  turned  she  would  see  his  face.  his  knees  up  and  his  arms 
resting on them. or he would be looking out of the window into darkness. 

“do any of you know a dance called the bosphorus hug?” the englishman asked. 
“no such thing.” 
kip  watched  the  large  shadows  slide  over  the  ceiling,  over  the  painted  wall.  he  struggled  up  and  walked  to  the  english

just running, cancelling the thought of exhaustion from his body. 

was it a sapper or was it a civilian? the smell of flower and herb along the road wall, the beginning stitch at his side. an 
accident or wrong choice. the sappers kept to themselves for the most part. they were an odd group as far as character went, 
somewhat  like  people  who  worked  with  jewels  or  stone,  they  had  a  hardness  and  clarity  within  them,  their  decisions 
frightening even to others in the same trade. kip had recognized that quality among gem-cutters but never in himself, though 
he  knew  others  saw  it  there.  the  sappers  never  became  familiar  with  each  other.  when  they  talked  they  passed  only 
information along, new devices, habits of the enemy. he would step into the town hall, where they were billeted, and his eyes 
would  take  in  the  three  faces  and  be  aware  of  the  absence  of  the  fourth.  or  there  would  be  four  of  them  and  in  a  field

he squatted in a corner of the clanging -waiting-room, rapt from all other thoughts; hands folded in lap, and pupils con-

and in some way on those long nights of reading and listening, she supposed, they had prepared themselves for the young 
soldier, the boy grown up, who would join them. but it was hana who was the young boy in the story. and if kip was anyone, 
he was the officer creighton. 

a book, a map of knots, a fuze board, a room of four people in an abandoned villa lit only by candlelight and now and then 
light from a storm, now and then the possible light from an explosion. the mountains and hills and florence blinded without

sleep,  caravaggio  his  “finding”  of  the  gramophone,  and  kip  a  difficult  defusing,  though  he  had  almost  forgotten  such  a 
moment already. he was someone who felt uncomfortable in celebrations, in victories. 

just fifty yards away, there had been no representation of them in the world, no sound or sight of them from the valley’s eye 
as hana’s and caravaggio’s shadows glided across the walls and kip sat comfortably encased in the alcove and the english 
patient sipped his wine and felt its spirit percolate through his unused body so it was quickly drunk, his voice bringing forth the 
whistle of a desert fox bringing forth a flutter of the english wood thrush he said was found only in essex, for it thrived in the 
vicinity of lavender and wormwood. all of the burned man’s desire was in the brain, the sapper had been thinking to himself, 
sitting in the stone alcove. then he turned his hea

looked back at them and for the first time in his life lied—”it’s all right, it wasn’t a mine. that seemed to come from a cleared 
area”—prepared to wait till the smell of the cordite reached him. 

 
now, hours later, kip sits once again in the window alcove. if he could walk the seven yards across the englishman’s room 
and touch her he would be sane. there was so little light in the room, just the candle at the table where she sat, not reading 
tonight; he thought perhaps she was slightly drunk.

boots to the floor and came silently into the room, where the party had been going on three hours earlier. he could smell 
alcohol in the air. she put her fingers to her lips as he entered and then pointed to the patient. he wouldn’t hear kip’s silent 
walk. the sapper sat in the well of the window again. if he could walk across the room and touch her he would be sane. but 
between them lay a treacherous and complex journey. it was a very wide world. and the englishman woke at any sound, the 
hearing aid turned to full level when he slept, so he could be secure in his own awareness. the girl’s eyes darted around and 
then were still when she faced kip in the rectangle of window.

kip tried to imagine her as a bird.

the mood of argument. “this is something that has concerned me most of my sexual life—which began late, i must announce

came to england for military training. has anyone, i wonder, fucked themselves into a corner. how old are you, kip?” 

“twenty-six.” 
“older than i am.” 
“older than hana. could you fall in love with her if she wasn’t smarter than you? i mean, she may not be smarter than you. 
but isn’t it important for you to think she is smarter than you in order to fall in love? think now. she can be obsessed by the

milk over his brown hand and up his arm to his elbow and then stopped. he didn’t move it away. 

 
there are two levels of long, narrow garden to the west of the house. a formal terrace and, higher up, the darker garden, 
where stone steps and concrete statues almost disappear under the green mildew of the rains. the sapper has his tent pitched 
here. rain falls and mist rises out of the valley, and the other rain from the branches of cypress and fir falls

that dark brown river, and to wake submerged within it, against the pulse of an unseen vein in his flesh beside her. the vein 
she would have to locate and insert a saline solution into if he were dying.

most of all she wished for a river they could swim in. there was a formality in swimming which she assumed was like being 
in a ballroom. but he had a different sense of rivers, had entered the moro in silence and pulled the harness of cables attached 
to the folding bailey bridge, the bolted steel panels of it slipping into the water behind him like a creature, and the sky then had

to the skootamatta river, kip,” she said. “i want to show you smoke lake. the woman my father loved lives out on the lakes, 
slips into canoes more easily than into a car. i miss thunder that blinks out electricity. i want you to meet clara of the canoes, 
the last one in my family. there are no others now. my father forsook her for a war.”

off  with his teeth, sucked and spat the morphine onto the brown hand before kip even knew what it was. kip pushing him

a remarkable find, young man. 
 
when she enters she sees kip and the english patient passing a can of condensed milk back and forth. the englishman sucks 
at the can, then moves the tin away from his face to chew the thick fluid. he beams at kip, who seems irritated that he does not 
have possession of it. the sapper glances at hana and hovers by the bedside, snapping his fingers a couple of times, managing 
finally to pull the tin away from the dark face. 

“we have discovered a shared pleasure. the boy and i. for me on my journeys in egypt, for him i

n india.” 
“have you ever had condensed-milk sandwiches?” xthe sapper asks. 
hana glances back and forth between the two of them. 
kip peers into the can. “i’ll get another one,” he says, and leaves the room. 
hana looks at the man in the bed. 
“kip and i are both international bastards—born in one place and choosing to live elsewhere. fighting to get back to or get 

away from our homelands all our lives. though 

kip doesn’t recognize that yet. that’s why we get on so well together.” 
in the kitchen kip stabs two holes into the new can of condensed milk with his bayonet, which, he realizes, is now used 

more and more for only this purpose, and runs back upstairs to the bedroom. 

“you must have been raised elsewhere,” the sapper says. “the english don’t suck it out that way.” 
“for  some  years  i  lived  in  the  desert.  i  learned  everything  i  knew  there.  everything  that  ever  h

he smiles at hana. 
“one feeds me morphine. one feeds me condensed milk. we may have discovered a balanced diet!” he turns back to kip. 
“how long have you been a sapper?” 
“five years.   mostly in  london.   then  italy.  with the unexploded-bomb units.” “who was your teacher?” 
“an englishman in woolwich. he was considered eccentric.” 
“the best kind of teacher. that must have been lord suffolk. did you meet miss morden?” 
“yes.” 
at no point does either of them attempt to make hana comfortable in their conversation. but she wants to know about his 

teacher, and how he would describe him. 

“what w

“he worked in scientific research. he was head of an experimental unit. miss morden, his secretary, was always with him, 
and his chauffeur, mr. fred harts. miss morden would take notes, which he dictated as he worked on a bomb, while mr. harts 
helped with the instruments. he was a brilliant man. they were called the holy trinity. they were blown up, all three of them, 
in 1941. at erith.”

some men had unwound their last knot of life in her arms. in the town of anghiari she had lifted live men to discover they 
were already being consumed by worms. in ortona she had held cigarettes to the mouth of the boy with no arms. nothing had 
stopped her. she had continued her duties while she secretly pulled her personal self back. so many nurses had turned into 
emotionally disturbed handmaidens of the war, in their yellow-and-crimson uniforms with bone buttons.

kirpal singh stood where the horse’s saddle would have lain across its back. at first he simply stood on the back of the

more slowly, appear more ladylike for the rest of the evening. “you don’t drink, mr. singh, but if you did, you’d do what i do. 
one full whisky and then you can sip away like a good courtier.” this was followed by her lazy, gravelly laugh. she was the 
only woman he was to meet in his life who carried two silver flasks with her. so she was still drinking, and lord suffolk was 
still nibbling at his kipling cakes. 

the other bomb had fallen half a mile away. another sc-25okg. it looked like the familiar kind. they had defused hundreds 
of them, most by rote. this was the way the war progressed. every six months or so the enemy altered something. you learned 
the trick, the whim, the little descant, and taught it to the rest of the units. they were at a new stage now.

them on the back of his shirt. all the loose and removed parts fill the various pockets across his chest. he is tired, checking 
things repetitively. he hears miss morden’s voice. “kip?” “yes.” “stop what you’re doing for a while, i’m coming down.” 
“you’d better not, miss morden.” “of course i can.” he does up the buttons on his various vest pockets and lays a cloth over 
the bomb; she clambers down into the white horse awkwardly and then sits next to him and opens up her satchel. she douses a 
lace handkerchief with the contents of a small bottle of eau de cologne and passes it to him. “wipe your face with this. lord

unscrews the thermos and pours each of them some tea. she unwraps oil paper and brings out strips of kipling cake. 

she seems to be in no hurry to go back up the slope, back to safety. and it would seem rude to remind her that she should

kip walks out of the field where he has been digging, his left hand raised in front of him as if he has sprained it. 
he passes the scarecrow for hana’s garden, the crucifix with its hanging sardine cans, and moves uphill towards the villa. he 
cups the hand held in front of him with the other as if protecting the flame of a candle. hana meets him on the terrace, and he 
takes her hand and holds it against his. the ladybird circling the nail on his small finger quickly crosses over onto her wrist

nt  turns  to  face  her  as  she  comes  in.  she  touches  his  foot  with  the  hand  that  holds  the  ladybird.  it  leaves  her, 
moving onto the dark skin. avoiding the sea of white sheet, it begins to make the long trek towards the distance of the rest of 
his body, a bright redness against what seems like volcanic flesh. 

 
 
in the library the fuze box is in midair, nudged off the counter by caravaggio when he turned to hana’s gleeful yell in the 

hall. before it reaches the floor kip’s body slides underneath it, and he catches it in his hand. 

caravaggio glances down to see the young man’s face blowing out all the air quickly through his cheeks. 
he thinks suddenly he owes him a life. 
kip begins to laugh, losing his shyness in front of the older man, holding up the box of wires. 
caravaggio will remember the slide. he could walk away, never see him again, and he would never forget him. years from 
now on a toronto street caravaggio will get out of a taxi and hold the

now the sapper just laughs up towards caravaggio’s face and up past that towards the ceiling. 
 
“i know all about sarongs.” caravaggio waved his hand towards kip and hana as he spoke. “in the east end of toronto i met 
these indians. i was robbing a house and it turned out to belong to an indian family. they woke from their beds and they were 
wearing these cloths, sarongs, to sleep in, and it intrigued me. we had lots to talk about and they eventually persuaded me to 
try it. i removed my clothes and stepped into one, and they immediately set upon me and chased me half naked into the night.” 

“is that a true story?” she grinned. 
“one of man

an intimate smile up close that can charm anything when he displays it. a toughness 
to his nature he doesn’t show. the englishman says he’s one of those warrior saints. but he has a peculiar sense of humour 
that is more rambunctious than his manner suggests. remember “i’ll rewire him in the morning.” ooh la la! 

he says lahore has thirteen gates—named for saints and emperors or where they lead to. 
the word bungalow comes from bengali. 
 
at four in the afternoon they had lowered kip into the pit in a harness until he was waist-deep in the muddy water, his body 
draped around the body of the esau bomb. the casing from  fin to tip ten feet  high, its  nose sunk into the  mud by his feet. 
beneath the brown water his thighs braced the metal casing, much the way he had seen soldiers holding women in the corner 
of naafi dance floors. when his arms tired he hung them upon the wooden struts at shoulder level, which were there to stop 
mud collapsing in around him. the sappers ha

small capsule broke, when some wire would stop wavering. those small mechanical semaphores were like a heart murmur or a 
stroke within the man crossing the street innocently in front of you. 

what town was he in? he couldn’t even remember. he heard a voice and looked up. hardy passed the equipment down in a 
satchel at the end of a rope, and it hung there while kip began to insert the various clips and tools into the many pockets of his 
tunic. he was humming the song hardy had been singing in the jeep on the way to the site—

he  could  walk  away  and  be  back  in  ten  minutes.  now  he  had  to  stand  there  beside  the  bomb.  they  were  two  suspicious 
creatures in an enclosed space. captain carlyle had been working in a shaft with frozen oxygen and the whole pit had suddenly 
burst into flames. they hauled him out fast, already unconscious in his harness. 

where was he? lisson grove? old kent road? 
kip dipped cotton wool into the muddy water and touched it to the casing about twelve inches away from the fuze. it fell 
away, so it meant he had to wait longer. when the cotton wool stuck, it meant enough of the area around the fuze was frozen 
and he could go on. he poured more oxygen into the cup. 

the growing circle of frost was a foot in radius now. a few more minutes. he looked at the clipping someone had taped onto 

the bomb. they had read it with much laugh-

they had discussed all this with each other before, but things were being confirmed, remembered for the final time. 
“put me on a microphone now and get back.”

kip  smiled.  he  was  ten  years  younger  than  hardy,  and  no  englishman,  but  hardy  was  happiest  in  the  cocoon  of 

regimental  discipline.  there  was  always  hesitation  by  the  soldiers  to  call  him  “sir,”  but  hardy  barked  it  out  loud  and 
enthusiastically. 

he was working fast now to prise out the fuze, all the batteries inert. 
“can you hear me? whistle.... okay, i heard it. a last topping up with oxygen. will let it bubble for thirty seconds. then

hen the frost. okay, i’m going to remove the dam,... okay, dam gone.” 

hardy was listening to everything and recording it in case something went wrong. one spark and kip would be in a shaft of 

flames. or there could be a joker in the bomb. the next person would have to consider the alternatives. 

“i’m using the quilter key.” he had pulled it out of his breast pocket. it was cold and he had to rub it warm. he began to 

remove the locking ring. it moved easily and he told hardy. 

“they’re changing guard at buckingham palace,” kip whistled. he pulled off the locking ring and the locating ring and let 

them sink into the water. he could feel them

aw something. he did not dare chip the hole any bigger. the contact of the circuit quivering like a silver tendril. if 

he could reach it. he tried to rub warmth into his hands. 

he breathed out, was still for a few seconds, and with the needle pliers cut the contact in two before he breathed in again. he 

gasped as the freeze burned part of his hand when he pulled it back out of the circuits. the bomb was dead. 

“fuze out. gaine off. kiss me.” hardy was already rolling up the winch and kip was trying to clip on the halter; he could 
hardly do it with the burn and the cold, all his muscles cold. he heard the pulley jerk and just held tight onto the leather straps 
still half attached around him. he began to feel his brown legs being pulled from the grip of the mud, removed like an ancient 
corpse out of a bog. his small feet rising out of the water. he emerged, lifted out of the pit into the sunlight, head and then 
torso. 

he hung there, a slow swivel under the tepee of poles th

they kept pausing, then walking on slowly. they had to go past the staring faces who were watching the slight brown man, 
shoeless, in the wet tunic, watching the drawn face that didn’t recognize or acknowledge anything, any of them. all of them 
silent. just stepping back to give him and hardy room. at the jeep he started shaking. his eyes couldn’t stand the glare off the 
windshield. hardy had to lift him, in stages, into the passenger seat. 

when hardy left, kip slowly pulled off his wet trousers and wrapped himself in the blanket. then he sat there. too cold and 
tired even to unscrew the thermos of hot tea on the seat beside him. he thought: i wasn’t even frightened down there. i was 
just angry—with my mistake, or the possibility that there was a joker. an animal reacting just to protect myself. 

only hardy, he realized, keeps me human now.

 in the last available light. throughout the late evening there 
would be only one candle flaring into the darkness beside the english patient, or a lamp half filled with oil if caravaggio had 
managed to forage any. but the corridors and other bedrooms hung in darkness, as if in a buried city. they became used to 
walking in darkness, hands out, touching the walls on either side with their fingertips. 

“no more light. no more colour.” hana would sing the phrase to herself again and again. kip’s unnerving habit of leaping 
down the stairs one hand halfway down the rail had to be stopped. she imagined his feet travelling through air and hitting the 
returning caravaggio in the stomach. 

 
she had blown out the candle in the englishman’s room an hour earlier. she had removed her tennis shoes, her frock was

on the old carpet, the smell of the past ancient rain still in it, the dust and grit on her wet arms. he bends down to her, she 
reaches out and clicks off his light. “i won, right?” he still has said nothing since he came into the room. his head goes into 
that gesture she loves which is partly a nod, partly a shake of possible disagreement. he cannot see her for the glare. he turns 
off her light so they are equal in darkness. 

 
there is the one month in their lives when hana and kip sleep beside each other. a formal celibacy between them. dis-
covering that in lovemaking there can be a whole civilisation, a whole country ahead of them. the love of the idea of him or

his deepest sleep while in the arms of hana, his orgasm something more to do with the pull of the moon, a tug of his body by 
the night. 

all evening his thin face lay against her ribs. she reminded him of the pleasure of being scratched, her fingernails in circles 
raking  his  back.  it  was  something  an  ayah  had  taught  him  years  earlier.  all  comfort  and  peace  during  childhood,  kip 
remembered, had come from her, never from the mother he loved or from his brother or father, whom he played with. when he 
was scared or unable to sleep it was the ayah who recognized his lack, who would ease him into sleep with her hand on his 
small thin back, this intimate stranger from south india who lived with them, helped run a household, cooked and served them 
meals, brought up her own children within the shell of the household, having comforted his older brother too in earlier years,

probably knowing the character of all of the children better than their real parents did. 

it was a mutual affection. if kip had been asked whom he loved most he would have named his ayah before his mother. her 
comforting love greater than any blood love or sexual love for him. all through his life, he would realize later, he was drawn 
outside the family to find such love. the platonic intimacy, or at times the sexual intimacy, of a stranger. he would be quite 
old before he recognized that about himself, before he could ask even himself that question of whom he loved most. 

only once did he feel he had given her

he dragged out the chair so she would turn, realize he was in the room. 
“hello, david.” 
he raised his arm. he felt that he had been in deserts for too long. 
“how is he?” 
“asleep. talked himself out.” 
“is he what you thought he was?” 
“he’s fine. we can let him be.” 
“i thought so. kip and i are both sure he is english. kip thinks the best people are eccentrics, he worked with one.” 
“i think kip is the eccentric myself. where is he, anyway?” 
“he’s plotting something on the terrace, doesn’t want me out there. something for my birthday.” hana stood up from her 

crouch at the grate, wiping her hand on the opposite forearm. 

“for your birthday i’m going to tell you a small story,” he said. 
she looked at him. 
“not about patrick, okay?”

stubble like sand against her skin. she loved that about him now; in the past he had always been meticulous. the parting in his 
hair like yonge street at midnight, patrick had said. caravaggio had in the past moved like a god in her presence. now, with 
his face and his trunk filled out and this greyness in him, he was a friendlier human. 

 
tonight dinner was being prepared by the sapper. caravaggio was not looking forward to it. one meal in three was a loss as 
far as he was concerned. kip found vegetables and presented them barely cooked, just briefly boiled into a soup. it was to be 
another purist meal, not what caravaggio wished for after a day such as this when he had been listening to the man upstairs. he 
opened the cupboard beneath the sink. there, wrapped in damp cloth, was some dried meat, which caravaggio cut and put into 
his pocket. 

“i can get you off the morphine, you know. i’m a good nurse.” 
“you’re surrounded by madmen...” 
“yes, i think we are al

l mad.” 
when kip called them, they walked out of the kitchen and onto the terrace, whose border, with its low stone balustrade, was 

ringed with light. 

it looked to caravaggio like a string of small electric candles found in dusty churches, and he thought the sapper had gone 
too far in removing them from a chapel, even for hana’s birthday. hana walked slowly forward with her hands over her face. 
there was no wind. her legs and thighs moved through the skirt of her frock as if it were thin water. her tenn

along the row of them; there must have been about forty. 

“forty-five,” kip said, “the years so far of this century. where i come from, we celebrate the age as well as ourselves.” 
hana moved alongside them, her hands in her pockets now, the way kip loved to see her walk. so relaxed, as if she had put 

her arms away for the night, now in simple armless movement. 

caravaggio  was diverted by the startling presence of three bottles of red wine on the table. he  walked over and read the 
labels and shook his head, amazed. he knew the sapper wouldn’t drink any of i

t. all three had already been opened. kip must 
have picked his way through some etiquette book in the library. then he saw the corn and the meat and the potatoes. hana slid 
her arm into kip’s and came with him to the table. 

they ate and drank, the unexpected thickness of the wine like meat on their tongues. they were soon turning silly in their 
toasts to the sapper—”the great forager”—and to the english patient. they toasted each other, kip joining in with his beaker of 
water. this was when he began to talk about himself. caravaggio pressing him on, not always listening, sometimes standing up 
and walking around the table, pacing and pacing with pleasure at all this. he wanted these two married, longed to force them 
verbally towards it, but they seemed to have their own strange rules about their relationship. what was he doing in this role. he 
sat down again. now and then he noticed the death of a light. the snail shells held o

nly so much oil. kip would rise and refill 
them with pink paraffin. 

“we must keep them lit till midnight.” 
they talked then about the war, so far away. “when the war with japan is over, everyone will finally go home,” kip said. 
“and where will you go?” caravaggio asked. the sapper rolled his head, half nodding, half shaking it, his mouth smiling. so 
caravaggio began to talk, mostly to kip. 

the  dog  cautiously  approached  the  table  and  laid  its  head  on  caravaggio’s  lap.  the  sapper  asked  for  other  stories  about 
toronto as if it were a place of peculiar wonders. snow that drowned the city, iced up the harbour, ferryboats in the summer 
where  people  listened  to  concerts.  but  what  he  was  really  interested  in  were  the  clues  to  hana’s  nature,  though  she  was 
evasive, veering caravaggio away from stories that involved some moment of her life.

she wanted kip to know her only in the 
present, a person perhaps more flawed or more compassionate or harder or more obsessed than the girl or young woman she 
 

 
had  been  then.  in  her  life  there  was  her  mother  alice  her  father  patrick  her  stepmother  clara  and  caravaggio.  she  had 
already admitted these names to kip as if they were her credentials, her dowry. they were faultless and needed no discussion. 
she used them like authorities in a book she could refer to on the right way to boil an egg, or the correct way to slip garlic into 
a lamb. they were not to be questioned.

and now—because he was quite drunk—caravaggio told the story of hana’s singing the “marseillaise,” which he had told 
her before. “yes, i have heard the song,” said kip, and he attempted a version of it. “no, you
 
 ___________________________
 
 have to sing it out,” said hana, 
“you have to sing it standing up!” 

she stood up, pulled her tennis shoes off and climbed onto the table. there were four snail lights flickering, almost dying, on 

the table beside her bare feet. 

“this is for you. this is how you must learn to sing it, kip. this is for you.” 
she sang up into darkness beyond their snail light, beyond the square of light from the english patient’s room and into the

that was his nature. she would not judge it in him. what right did she have. kip stepping out each morning with his satchel 
hanging off his left shoulder and walking the path away from the villa san girolamo. each morning she watched him, seeing 
his  freshness  towards  the  world  perhaps  for  the  last  time.  after  a  few  minutes  he  would  look  up  into  the  shrapnel-torn 
cypresses, whose middle branches had been shelled away. pliny must have walked down a path like this, or stendahl, because

kip would look up, the arch of the high wounded trees over him, the path in front of him mediaeval, and he a young man of 
the  strangest  profession  his  century  had  invented,  a  sapper,  a  military  engineer  who  detected  and  disarmed  mines.  each 
morning he emerged from the tent, bathed and dressed in the garden, and stepped away from the villa and its surroundings, not 
even entering the house—maybe a wave if he saw her— as if language, humanity, would confuse him, get, like blood

it was the moment he left them all behind. the moment the drawbridge closed behind the knight and he was alone with just 
the peacefulness of his own strict talent. in siena there was that mural she had seen. a fresco of a city. a few yards outside the 
city walls the artist’s paint had crumbled away, so there was not even the security of art to provide an orchard in the far acres 
for the traveller leaving the castle. that was where, she felt, kip went during the day. each morning he would step from the 
painted scene towards dark bluffs of chaos. the knight. the warrior saint. she would see the khaki uniform flickering through 
the cypresses. the englishman had called himfato profugus—fate’s fugitive. she guessed that these days began for him with 
the pleasure of lifting his eyes up to the trees.

 booby  traps.  there  were  delayed-action  bombs  sealed  into  the  walls  of  public 
buildings.  nearly  every  vehicle  was  rigged.  the  sappers  became  permanently  suspicious  of  any  object  placed  casually  in  a 
room. they distrusted everything they saw on a table unless it was placed facing “four o’clock.” years after the war a sapper 
putting a pen on a table would position it with the thicker end facing four o’clock. 

naples continued as a war zone for six weeks and kip was there with the unit for the whole period. after two weeks they 
discovered the citizens in the caves. their skin dark with shit and typhus. the procession of them back into the city hospitals 
was one of ghosts. 

four days later the central post office blew up, and seventy-two were killed or wounded. the richest collection of mediaeval 

records in europe had already burned in the city archives.

these were to be the strangest and most disturbing hours of their lives.

landscape. kip always returns to the villa along the yellow path between the cypresses around seven in the evening, which is 
when the thunder, if there is going to be thunder, begins. the mediaeval experience.

scourged  christ  pulled  back,  the  whip  coming  down,  the  baying  dog,  three  soldiers  in  the  next  chapel  tableau  raising  the 
crucifix higher towards the painted clouds. 

the villa san girolamo, located where it is, also receives such moments of light—the dark halls, the room the englishman 
lies in, the kitchen where hana is laying a fire, the shelled chapel—all lit suddenly, without shadow. kip will walk with no 
qualms under the trees in his patch of garden during such storms, the dangers of being killed by lightning pathetically minimal 
compared with the danger of his daily life. the naive catholic images from those hillside shrines that he has seen are with him 
in the half-darkness, as he counts the seconds between lightning and thunder. perhaps this villa is a similar tableau, the four of 
them in private movement, momentarily lit up, flung ironically against this war.

ner of the church now, with the terracotta figures painted the colour of white humans. the scene depicts a 
bedroom where a woman is in conversation with an angel. the woman’s curly brown hair reveals itself under the loose blue 
cape, the fingers of her left hand touching her breastbone. when he steps forward into the room he realizes everything is larger 
than life. his own head is no higher than the shoulder of the woman. the angel’s raised arm reaches fifteen feet in height. still, 
for kip, they are company. it is an inhabited room, and he walks within the discussion of these creatures that represent some 
fable about mankind and heaven. 

he slips his satchel from his shoulder and faces the bed. he wants to lie on it, hesitating only because of the presence of the 
angel. he has already walked around the ethereal body and noticed the dusty light bulbs attached to its back beneath the dark 
coloured wings, and he knows in spite of his desire that he could not sleep easily in the

under the thin layer of dust the angel’s face has a powerful joy. attached to its back are the six light bulbs, two of which are

from his body which had never raised its voice among them. he sinks to his knees, as if unbuckled. stays like that and then 
slowly gets up and moves in a diagonal towards his tent, enters it, and closes the flaps behind him. there is the dry crackle of 
thunder and she sees her arms darken. 

kip emerges from the tent with the rifle. he comes into the villa san girolamo and sweeps past her, moving like a steel ball 
in an arcade game, through the doorway and up the stairs three steps at a time, his breath metronomed, the hit of his boots 
against the vertical sections of stairs. she hears his feet along the hallway as she continues to sit at the table in the kitchen, the 
book in front of her, the pencil, these objects frozen and shadowed in the pre-storm light.

kip looks condemned, separate from the world, his brown face weeping. the body turns and fires into the old fountain, and 
the plaster explodes dust onto the bed. he pivots back so the rifle points at the englishman. he begins to shudder, and then 
everything in him tries to control that.
