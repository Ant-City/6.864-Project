ked at the door. the servant was out; so was her grandfather. the person, after waiting a minute, came in and tapped at the door of the room.
â€œwhoâ€™s there?â€ said eustacia.
â€œplease, capâ€™n vye, will you let usâ€”â€”â€
eustacia arose and went to the door. â€œi cannot allow you to come in so boldly. you should have waited.â€
â€œthe capâ€™n said i might come in without any fuss,â€ was answered in a ladâ€™s pleasant voice.
â€œoh, did he?â€ said eustacia more gently. â€œwhat do you want, charley?â€
â€œplease will your grandfather lend us his fuelhouse to try over our parts in, tonight at seven oâ€™clock?â€
â€œwhat, are you one of the egdon mummers for this year?â€
â€œyes, miss. the capâ€™n used to let the old mummers practise here.â€
â€œi know it. yes, you may use the fuelhouse if you like,â€ said eustacia languidly.
the choice of captain vyeâ€™s fuelhouse as the scene of rehearsal was dictated by the fact that his dwelling was nearly in the centre of the heath. the fuelhouse was

the lads and men prepared to leave the premises, and eustacia returned to her fireside. she was immersed in thought, but not for long. in a few minutes the lad charley, who had come to ask permission to use the place, returned with the key to the kitchen. eustacia heard him, and opening the door into the passage said, â€œcharley, come here.â€
the lad was surprised. he entered the front room not without blushing; for he, like many, had felt the power of this girlâ€™s face and form.
she pointed to a seat by the fire, and entered the other side of the chimney-corner herself. it could be seen in her face that whatever motive she might have had in asking the yout

â€œwhich part do you play, charleyâ€”the turkish knight, do you not?â€ inquired the beauty, looking across the smoke of the fire to him on the other side.
â€œyes, miss, the turkish knight,â€ he replied diffidently.
â€œis yours a long part?â€
â€œnine speeches, about.â€
â€œcan you repeat them to me? if so i should like to hear them.â€
the lad smiled into the glowing turf and beganâ€”
     â€œhere come i, a turkish knight,

eustacia had occasionally heard the part recited before. when the lad ended she began, precisely in the same words, and ranted on without hitch or divergence till she too reached the end. it was the same thing, yet how different. like in form, it had the added softness and finish of a raffaelle after perugino, which, while faithfully reproducing the original subject, entirely distances the original art.
charleyâ€™s eyes rounded with surprise. â€œwell, you be a clever lady!â€ he said, in admiration. â€œiâ€™ve been three weeks learning mine.â€
â€œi have heard it before,â€ she quietly observed. â€œnow, would you do anything to please me, charley?â€
â€œiâ€™d do a good deal, miss.â€
â€œwould you let me play your part for one night?â€
â€œoh, miss! but your womanâ€™s gownâ€”you couldnâ€™t.â€
â€œi can get boyâ€™s clothesâ€”at least all that would be wanted besides the mumming dress. what should i have

 excuse yourself from playing that night, and to say that somebodyâ€”a cousin of miss vyeâ€™sâ€”would act for you. the other mummers have never spoken to me in their lives so that it would be safe enough; and if it were not, i should not mind. now, what must i give you to agree to this? half a crown?â€
the youth shook his head
â€œfive shillings?â€
he shook his head again. â€œmoney wonâ€™t do it,â€ he said, brushing the iron head of the firedog with the hollow of his hand.
â€œwhat will, then, charley?â€ said eustacia in a disappointed tone.
â€œyou know what you forbade me at the maypoling, miss,â€ murmured the lad, without looking at her, and still stroking the firedogâ€™s head.
â€œyes,â€ said eustacia, with a little more hauteur. â€œyou wanted to join hands with me in the ring, if i recollect?â€
â€œhalf an hour of that, and iâ€™ll agree, miss.â€
eustacia regarded the youth steadfastly. he was three years younger than herself, but apparently not backward for his age. â€œhalf an hour of

â€œyes, miss eustaciaâ€”i will, if i may kiss it too. a quarter of an hour. and iâ€™ll swear to do the best i can to let you take my place without anybody knowing. donâ€™t you think somebody might know your tongue, miss?â€
â€œit is possible. but i will put a pebble in my mouth to make is less likely. very well; you shall be allowed to have my hand as soon as you bring the dress and your sword and staff. i donâ€™t want you any longer now.â€
charley departed, and eustacia felt more and more interest in life. here was something to do: here was some one to see, and a charmingly adventurous way to see him. â€œah,â€ she said to herself, â€œwant of an object to live forâ€”thatâ€™s all is the matter with me!â€
eustaciaâ€™s manner was as a rule of a slumberous sort, her passions being of the massive rather than the vivacious kind. but when aroused she would make a dash which, just for the time, was not unlike the move of a naturally lively pers

the next evening eustacia stood punctually at the fuelhouse door, waiting for the dusk which was to bring charley with the trappings. her grandfather was at home tonight, and she would be unable to ask her confederate indoors.
he appeared on the dark ridge of heathland, like a fly on a negro, bearing the articles with him, and came up breathless with his walk.
â€œhere are the things,â€ he whispered, placing them upon the threshold. â€œand now, miss eustaciaâ€”â€
â€œthe payment. it is quite ready. i am as good as my word.â€
she leant against the door-post, and gave him her hand. charley took it in both h

â€œwhy, thereâ€™s a glove on it!â€ he said in a deprecating way.
â€œi have been walking,â€ she observed.
â€œbut, miss!â€
â€œwellâ€”it is hardly fair.â€ she pulled off the glove, and gave him her bare hand.
they stood together minute after minute, without further speech, each looking at the blackening scene, and each thinking his and her own thoughts.
â€œi think i wonâ€™t use it all up tonight,â€ said charley devotedly, when six or eight minutes had been passed by him caressing her hand. â€œmay i have the other few minutes another time?â€
â€œas you like,â€ said she without the least emotion. â€œbut it must be over in a week. now, there is only one thing i want you to doâ€”to wait while i put on the dress, and then to see if i do my part properly. but let me look first indoors.â€
she vanished for a minute or two, and went in. her grandfather was safely asleep in his chair. â€œnow, then,â€ she sai

d, on returning, â€œwalk down the garden a little way, and when i am ready iâ€™ll call you.â€
charley walked and waited, and presently heard a soft whistle. he returned to the fuelhouse door.
â€œdid you whistle, miss vye?â€
â€œyes; come in,â€ reached him in eustaciaâ€™s voice from a back quarter. â€œi must not strike a light till the door is shut, or it may be seen shining. push your hat into the hole through to the wash-house, if you can feel your way across.â€
charley did as commanded, and she struck the light revealing herself to be changed in sex, brilliant in colours, and armed from top to toe. perhaps she quailed a little under charleyâ€™s vigorous gaze, but whether any shyness at her male attire appeared upon her countenance could not be seen by reason of the strips of ribbon which used to cover the face in mumming costumes, representing the barred visor of the mediaeval helmet.
â€œit fits pretty well,â€ she said, looking down at the white overalls, â€

eustacia then proceeded in her delivery, striking the sword against the staff or lance at the minatory phrases, in the orthodox mumming manner, and strutting up and down. charley seasoned his admiration with criticism of the gentlest kind, for the touch of eustaciaâ€™s hand yet remained with him.
â€œand now for your excuse to the others,â€ she said. â€œwhere do you meet before you go to mrs. yeobrightâ€™s?â€
â€œwe thought of meeting here, miss, if you have nothing to say against it. at eight oâ€™clock, so as to get there by nine.â€
â€œyes. well, you of course must not appear. i will march in about five minutes late, ready-dressed, and tell them that you canâ€™t come.

â€œthere, â€˜tis all gone; and i didnâ€™t mean quite all,â€ he said, with a sigh.

â€œyes, miss. well, â€˜tis over, and now iâ€™ll get home-along.â€

the next evening the mummers were assembled in the same spot, awaiting the entrance of the turkish knight.

â€œit wants ten minutes to, by grandfer cantleâ€™s watch.â€
â€œand â€˜tis five minutes past by the captainâ€™s clock.â€
on egdon there was no absolute hour of the day. the time at any moment was a number of varying doctrines professed by the different hamlets, some of them having originally grown up from a common root, and then become divided by secession, some having been alien from the beginning. west egdon believed in blooms-end time, east

eustacia had watched the assemblage through the hole; and seeing that now was the proper moment to enter, she went from the â€œlinhayâ€ and boldly pulled the bobbin of the fuelhouse door. her grandfather was safe at the quiet woman.
â€œhereâ€™s charley at last! how late you be, charley.â€
â€œâ€˜tis not charley,â€ said the turkish knight from within his visor. â€œâ€˜tis a cousin of miss vyeâ€™s, come to take charleyâ€™s place from curiosity. he was obliged to go and look for the heath-croppers that have got into the meads, and i agreed to take his place, as he knew he couldnâ€™t come back here again tonight. i know the part as well as he.â€
her graceful gait, elegant figure, and dignified manner in general won the mummers to the opinion tha

â€œit donâ€™t matterâ€”if you be not too young,â€ said saint george. eustaciaâ€™s voice had sounded somewhat more juvenile and fluty than charleyâ€™s.
â€œi know every word of it, i tell you,â€ said eustacia decisively. dash being all that was required to carry her triumphantly through, she adopted as much as was necessary. â€œgo ahead, lads, with the try-over. iâ€™ll challenge any of you to find a mistake in me.â€
the play was hastily rehearsed, whereupon the other mummers were delighted with the new knight. they extinguished the candles at half-past eight, and set out upon the heath in the direction of mrs. yeobrightâ€™s house at bloo

ession of pain overspread his face. he turned for a moment into the passage to hide it. then he came back again.
â€œdo you mean miss vye?â€ he said. â€œhow is itâ€”that she can be married so soon?â€
â€œby the will of god and a ready young man, i suppose.â€
â€œyou donâ€™t mean mr. yeobright?â€
â€œyes. he has been creeping about with her all the spring.â€
â€œi supposeâ€”she was immensely taken with him?â€
â€œshe is crazy about him, so their general servant of all work tells me. and that lad charley that looks after the horse is all in a daze about it. the stun-poll has got fond-like of her.â€
â€œis she livelyâ€”is she glad? going to be married so soonâ€”well!â€
â€œit isnâ€™t so very soon.â€
â€œno; not so very soon.â€
wildeve went indoors to the empty room, a curious heartache within him. he rested his elbow upon the mantelpiece and his face upon his hand. when thomasin entered the room he did not tell her of what he had heard. the old longing for eustacia had reappeared in his soulâ€”

â€œno. but she will be leaving soon. you may possibly meet her at the corner.â€
venn made a farewell obeisance, and walked back to his former position, where the byroad from mistover joined the highway. here he remained fixed for nearly half an hour, and then another pair of lights came down the hill. it was the old-fashioned wheeled nondescript belonging to the captain, and thomasin sat in it alone, driven by charley.
the reddleman came up as they slowly turned the corner. â€œi beg pardon for stopping you, mrs. wildeve,â€ he said. â€œbut i have something to give you privately from mrs. yeobright.â€ he handed a small parcel; it consisted of the hundred guineas he had just won, roughly twisted up in a piece of paper.
thomasin recovered from her surprise, and took the packet. â€œthatâ€™s all, maâ€™amâ€”i wish you good night,â€ he said, and vanished from her view.

â€œno,â€ said eustacia blankly.
â€œwell, he has come into a fortune of eleven thousand poundsâ€”uncle died in canada, just after hearing that all his family, whom he was sending home, had gone to the bottom in the cassiopeia; so wildeve has come into everything, without in the least expecting it.â€
eustacia stood motionless awhile. â€œhow long has he known of this?â€ she asked.
â€œwell, it was known to him this morning early, for i knew it at ten oâ€™clock, when charley came back. now, he is what i call a lucky man. what a fool you were, eustacia!â€
â€œin what way?â€ she said, lifting her eyes in apparent calmness.
â€œwhy, in not sticking to him when you had him.â€
â€œhad him, indeed!â€
â€œi did not know there had ever been anything between you till lately; and, faith, i should have been hot and strong against it if i had known; but since it seems that there was some sniffing between ye, why the deuce didnâ€™t you stick to him?â€

â€œcaptain vye is not at home?â€ she said.
â€œno, maâ€™am,â€ said the lad in a flutter of feeling; â€œheâ€™s gone to weatherbury, and wonâ€™t be home till night. and the servant is gone home for a holiday. so the house is locked up.â€
eustaciaâ€™s face was not visible to charley as she stood at the doorway, her back being to the sky, and the stable but indifferently lighted; but the wildness of her manner arrested his attention. she turned and walked away across the enclosur

when she had disappeared charley, with misgiving in his eyes, slowly came from the stable door, and going to another point in the bank he looked over. eustacia was leaning against it on the outside, her face covered with her hands, and her head pressing the dewy heather which bearded the bankâ€™s outer side. she appeared to be utterly indifferent to the circumstance that her bonnet, hair, and garments were becoming wet and disarranged by the moisture of her cold, harsh pillow. clearly something was wrong.

eustacia started up, and said, â€œah, charleyâ€”you have followed me. you did not think when i left home in the summer that i should come back like this!â€
â€œi did not, dear maâ€™am. can i help you now?â€
â€œi am afraid not. i wish i could get into the house. i feel giddyâ€”thatâ€™s all.â€
â€œlean on my arm, maâ€™am, till we get to the porch, and i will try to open the door.â€

â€œshall i get you something to eat and drink?â€ he said.
â€œif you please, charley. but i suppose there is no fire?â€
â€œi can light it, maâ€™am.â€
he vanished, and she heard a splitting of wood and a blowing of bellows; and presently he returned, saying, â€œi have lighted a fire in the kitchen, and now iâ€™ll light one here.â€
he lit the fire, eustacia dreamily observing him from her couch. when it was blazing up he said, â€œshall i wheel you round in front of it, maâ€™am, as the morning is chilly?â€
â€œyes, if you like.â€
â€œshall i go and bring the victuals now?â€

 forgot where she was, and had for a moment to consider by an effort what the sounds meant. after an interval which seemed short to her whose thoughts were elsewhere, he came in with a tray on which steamed tea and toast, though it was nearly lunch-time.
â€œplace it on the table,â€ she said. â€œi shall be ready soon.â€
he did so, and retired to the door; when, however, he perceived that she did not move he came back a few steps.
â€œlet me hold it to you, if you donâ€™t wish to get up,â€ said charley. he brought the tray to the front of the couch, where he knelt down, adding, â€œi will hold it for you.â€
eustacia sat up and poured out a cup of tea. â€œyou are very kind to me, charley,â€ she murmured as she sipped.
â€œwell, i ought to be,â€ said he diffidently, taking great trouble not to rest his eyes upon her, though this was their only natural position, eustacia being immediately before him. â€œyou have been kind to me.â€
â€œhow have i?â€ said eustacia.

â€œyes, you wanted to go in my place.â€
â€œi remember. i do indeed rememberâ€”too well!â€
she again became utterly downcast; and charley, seeing that she was not going to eat or drink any more, took away the tray.
afterwards he occasionally came in to see if the fire was burning, to ask her if she wanted anything, to tell her that the wind had shifted from south to west, to ask her if she would like him to gather her some blackberries; to all which inquiries she replied in the negative or with indifference.
she remained on the settee some time longer, when she aroused herself and went upstairs. the room in which she had formerly

the instant quashing of her purpose by their absence affected her brain as a sudden vacuum affects the bodyâ€”she nearly fainted. who had done this? there was only one person on the premises besides herself. eustacia involuntarily turned to the open window which overlooked the garden as far as the bank that bounded it. on the summit of the latter stood charley, sufficiently elevated by its height to see into the room. his gaze was directed eagerly and solicitously upon her.
she went downstairs to the door and beckoned to him.
â€œyou have taken them away?â€
â€œyes, maâ€™am.â€
â€œwhy did you do it?â€
â€œi saw you looking at them too long.â€
â€œwhat has that to do with it?â€

she turned aside, her face for the first time softening from the stony immobility of the earlier day, and the corners of her mouth resuming something of that delicacy of cut which was always lost in her moments of despair. at last she confronted him again.
â€œwhy should i not die if i wish?â€ she said tremulously. â€œi have made a bad bargain with life, and i am weary of itâ€”weary. and now you have hindered my escape. o, why did you, charley! what makes death painful except the thought of othersâ€™ grief?â€”and that is absent in my case, for not a sigh would follow me!â€
â€œah, it is trouble that has done this! i wish in my very soul that he who brought it about might die and rot, even if â€˜tis transportation to say it!â€
â€œcharley, no more of that. what do you mean to do about this you have seen?â€
â€œkeep it close as night, if you promise not to think of it again.â€
â€œyou need not fear. the moment has passed. i promise.â€

, entered the house, and lay down.
later in the afternoon her grandfather returned. he was about to question her categorically, but on looking at her he withheld his words.
â€œyes, it is too bad to talk of,â€ she slowly returned in answer to his glance. â€œcan my old room be got ready for me tonight, grandfather? i shall want to occupy it again.â€
he did not ask what it all meant, or why she had left her husband, but ordered the room to be prepared.




5â€”an old move inadvertently repeated

charleyâ€™s attentions to his former mistress were unbounded. the only solace to his own trouble lay in his attempts to relieve hers. hour after hour he considered her wants; he thought of her presence there with a sort of gratitude, and, while uttering imprecations on the cause of her unhappiness, in some measure blessed the result. perhaps she would always remain there, he thought, and then he would be as happy as he had been before. his dread was lest she should think fit to return to alderworth, an

ouse at blooms-end.
on another occasion when reconnoitring thus she beheld two female figures walking in the vale. the day was fine and clear; and the persons not being more than half a mile off she could see their every detail with the telescope. the woman walking in front carried a white bundle in her arms, from one end of which hung a long appendage of drapery; and when the walkers turned, so that the sun fell more directly upon them, eustacia could see that the object was a baby. she called charley, and asked him if he knew who they were, though she well guessed.
â€œmrs. wildeve and the nurse-girl,â€ said charley.
â€œthe nurse is carrying the baby?â€ said eustacia.
â€œno, â€˜tis mrs. wildeve carrying that,â€ he answered, â€œand the nurse walks behind carrying nothing.â€
the lad was in good spirits that day, for the fifth of november had again come round, and he was planning yet another scheme to divert her from her too absorbing thoughts. for two successive years his mistress had seem

d went on with his secret preparations for a cheerful surprise, the more zealously that he had been absent last time and unable to assist. at every vacant minute he hastened to gather furze-stumps, thorn-tree roots, and other solid materials from the adjacent slopes, hiding them from cursory view.
the evening came, and eustacia was still seemingly unconscious of the anniversary. she had gone indoors after her survey through the glass, and had not been visible since. as soon as it was quite dark charley began to build the bonfire, choosing precisely that spot on the bank which eustacia had chosen at previous times.
when all the surrounding bonfires had burst into existence charley kindled his, and arranged its fuel so that it should not require tending for some time. he then went back to the house, and lingered round the door and windows till she should by some means or other learn of his achievement and come out to witness it. but the shutters were closed, the door remained shut, and no heed

e, continuing to do this for more than half an hour. it was not till his stock of fuel had greatly diminished that he went to the back door and sent in to beg that mrs. yeobright would open the window-shutters and see the sight outside.
eustacia, who had been sitting listlessly in the parlour, started up at the intelligence and flung open the shutters. facing her on the bank blazed the fire, which at once sent a ruddy glare into the room where she was, and overpowered the candles.
â€œwell done, charley!â€ said captain vye from the chimney-corner. â€œbut i hope it is not my wood that heâ€™s burning.... ah, it was this time last year that i met with that man venn, bringing home thomasin yeobrightâ€”to be sure it was! well, who would have thought that girlâ€™s troubles would have ended so well? what a snipe you were in that matter, eustacia! has your husband written to you yet?â€
â€œno,â€ said eustacia, looking vaguely through the window at the fire, which just then so much engaged her mind t

hat she did not resent her grandfatherâ€™s blunt opinion. she could see charleyâ€™s form on the bank, shovelling and stirring the fire; and there flashed upon her imagination some other form which that fire might call up.
she left the room, put on her garden bonnet and cloak, and went out. reaching the bank, she looked over with a wild curiosity and misgiving, when charley said to her, with a pleased sense of himself, â€œi made it oâ€™ purpose for you, maâ€™am.â€
â€œthank you,â€ she said hastily. â€œbut i wish you to put it out now.â€
â€œit will soon burn down,â€ said charley, rather disappointed. â€œis it not a pity to knock it out?â€
â€œi donâ€™t know,â€ she musingly answered.
they stood in silence, broken only by the crackling of the flames, till charley, perceiving that she did not want to talk to him, moved reluctantly away.

 have won; and eustacia could now, like other people at such a stage, take a standing-point outside herself, observe herself as a disinterested spectator, and think what a sport for heaven this woman eustacia was.
while she stood she heard a sound. it was the splash of a stone in the pond.
had eustacia received the stone full in the bosom her heart could not have given a more decided thump. she had thought of the possibility of such a signal in answer to that which had been unwittingly given by charley; but she had not expected it yet. how prompt wildeve was! yet how could he think her capable of deliberately wishing to renew their assignations now? an impulse to leave the spot, a desire to stay, struggled within her; and the desire held its own. more than that it did not do, for she refrained even from ascending the bank and looking over. she remained motionless, not disturbing a muscle of her face or raising her eyes; for were she to turn up her face the fire on the bank would shine upon it

however, on the fact that there was a third person in his house when his mother was turned away. if it proved that wildeve was innocently there he would doubtless openly mention it. if he were there with unjust intentions wildeve, being a man of quick feeling, might possibly say something to reveal the extent to which eustacia was compromised.
but on reaching his cousinâ€™s house he found that only thomasin was at home, wildeve being at that time on his way towards the bonfire innocently lit by charley at mistover. thomasin then, as always, was glad to see clym, and took him to inspect the sleeping baby, carefully screening the candlelight from the infantâ€™s eyes with her hand.
â€œtamsin, have you heard that eustacia is not with me now?â€ he said when they had sat down again.
â€œno,â€ said thomasin, alarmed.
â€œand not that i have left alderworth?â€
â€œno. i never hear tidings from alderworth unless you bring them. what is the matter?â€
clym in a disturbed voice related to her his visit

tly,â€ said clym with rising excitement. â€œi believe she means to elope tonight with wildeve. i am just going to look to it.â€
â€œwell, she has left my house; she left about half an hour ago. whoâ€™s sitting there?â€
â€œmy cousin thomasin.â€
the captain bowed in a preoccupied way to her. â€œi only hope it is no worse than an elopement,â€ he said.
â€œworse? whatâ€™s worse than the worst a wife can do?â€
â€œwell, i have been told a strange tale. before starting in search of her i called up charley, my stable lad. i missed my pistols the other day.â€
â€œpistols?â€
â€œhe said at the time that he took them down to clean. he has now owned that he took them because he saw eustacia looking curiously at them; and she afterwards owned to him that she was thinking of taking her life, but bound him to secrecy, and promised never to think of such a thing again. i hardly suppose she will ever have bravado enough to use one of them; but it shows what has been lurking in her mind; and people who thi

 banknotes as they waved backwards and forwards in the draught of the chimney till their flaccidity was changed to dry crispness throughout. then the woman came and unpinned them, and, folding them together, carried the handful upstairs. presently the doctor appeared from above with the look of a man who could do no more, and, pulling on his gloves, went out of the house, the trotting of his horse soon dying away upon the road.
at four oâ€™clock there was a gentle knock at the door. it was from charley, who had been sent by captain vye to inquire if anything had been heard of eustacia. the girl who admitted him looked in his face as if she did not know what answer to return, and showed him in to where venn was seated, saying to the reddleman, â€œwill you tell him, please?â€
venn told. charleyâ€™s only utterance was a feeble, indistinct sound. he stood quite still; then he burst out spasmodically, â€œi shall see her once more?â€
â€œi dare say you may see her,â€ said diggory gravely. â€œbut

hadnâ€™t you better run and tell captain vye?â€
â€œyes, yes. only i do hope i shall see her just once again.â€
â€œyou shall,â€ said a low voice behind; and starting round they beheld by the dim light, a thin, pallid, almost spectral form, wrapped in a blanket, and looking like lazarus coming from the tomb.
it was yeobright. neither venn nor charley spoke, and clym continued, â€œyou shall see her. there will be time enough to tell the captain when it gets daylight. you would like to see her tooâ€”would you not, diggory? she looks very beautiful now.â€
venn assented by rising to his feet, and with charley he followed clym to the foot of the staircase, where he took off his boots; charley did the same. they followed yeobright upstairs to the landing, where there was a candle burning, which yeobright took in his hand, and with it led the way

 husband good-bye as they departed. his steps were insensibly bent towards mistover by the path that he had followed on that terrible morning when he learnt the strange news from susanâ€™s boy.
he did not turn aside to the cottage, but pushed on to an eminence, whence he could see over the whole quarter that had once been eustaciaâ€™s home. while he stood observing the darkening scene somebody came up. clym, seeing him but dimly, would have let him pass silently, had not the pedestrian, who was charley, recognized the young man and spoken to him.
â€œcharley, i have not seen you for a length of time,â€ said yeobright. â€œdo you often walk this way?â€
â€œno,â€ the lad replied. â€œi donâ€™t often come outside the bank.â€
â€œyou were not at the maypole.â€
â€œno,â€ said charley, in the same listless tone. â€œi donâ€™t care for that sort of thing now.â€
â€œyou rather liked miss eustacia, didnâ€™t you?â€ yeobright gently asked. eustacia had frequently told him of charleyâ€™s romantic attachm

â€œyes, very much. ah, i wishâ€”â€
â€œyes?â€
â€œi wish, mr. yeobright, you could give me something to keep that once belonged to herâ€”if you donâ€™t mind.â€
â€œi shall be very happy to. it will give me very great pleasure, charley. let me think what i have of hers that you would like. but come with me to the house, and iâ€™ll see.â€
they walked towards blooms-end together. when they reached the front it was dark, and the shutters were closed, so that nothing of the interior could be seen.
â€œcome round this way,â€ said clym. â€œmy entrance is at the back for the present.â€
the two went round and ascended the crooked stair in darkness till clymâ€™s sitting-room on the upper floor was reached, where he lit a candle, cha

way with you,â€ said clym. and amid the noise of merriment from below they descended. their path to the front led them close to a little side window, whence the rays of candles streamed across the shrubs. the window, being screened from general observation by the bushes, had been left unblinded, so that a person in this private nook could see all that was going on within the room which contained the wedding guests, except in so far as vision was hindered by the green antiquity of the panes.
â€œcharley, what are they doing?â€ said clym. â€œmy sight is weaker again tonight, and the glass of this window is not good.â€
charley wiped his own eyes, which were rather blurred with moisture, and stepped closer to the casement. â€œmr. venn is asking christian cantle to sing,â€ he replied, â€œand christian is moving about in his chair as if he were much frightened at the question, and his father has struck up a stave instead of him.â€
â€œyes, i can hear the old manâ€™s voice,â€ said clym. â€œso th
