[CHARACTER] - 
                edna is the protagonist of the novel, and the "awakening"
to which the title refers is hers. the twenty-eight-year-old wife
of a new orleans businessman, edna suddenly finds herself dissatisfied with
her marriage and the limited, conservative lifestyle that it allows.
she emerges from her semi-conscious state of devoted wife and mother
to a state of total awareness, in which she discovers her own identity 
and acts on her desires for emotional and sexual satisfaction. through
a series of experiences, or "awakenings," edna becomes a shockingly independent
woman, who lives apart from her 
husband and children and is responsible only to her own urges and
passions. tragically, edna's awakenings isolate her from others
and ultimately lead her to a 
state of total solitude.
