the  faint  buzz  of  a  motor
engine and we saw a fishing boat very far out, gliding almost imperceptibly across
the dazzling smoothness.

marie picked some rock irises. going down the steep path leading to the sea, we

saw some bathers already on the sands.

raymondâ€™s friend owned a small wooden bungalow at the near end of the beach.
its back rested against the cliffside, while the front stood on piles, which the water
was already lapping. raymond introduced us to his friend, whose name was masson.
he  was  tall,  broad-shouldered,  and  thick-set;  his  wife  was  a  plump,  cheerful  little
woman who spoke with a paris accent.

masson promptly told us to make ourselves at home. he had gone out fishing, he
said,  first  thing  in  the  morning,  and  there  would  be  fried  fish  for  lunch.  i
congratulated him on his little bungalow, and he said he always spent his week ends
and holidays here. â€œwith the missus, needless to say,â€ he added. i glanced at her, and
noticed  that  she

 and  marie  seemed  to  be  getting  on  well  together;  laughing  and
chattering away. for the first time, perhaps, i seriously considered the possibility of
my marrying her.

masson  wanted  to  have  a  swim  at  once,  but  his  wife  and  raymond  were
disinclined to move. so only the three of us, marie, masson, and myself, went down
to the beach. marie promptly plunged in, but masson and i waited for a bit. he was
rather  slow  of  speech  and  had,  i  noticed,  a  habit  of  saying  â€œand  whatâ€™s  moreâ€
between his phrasesâ€”even when the second added nothing really to the first. talking
of marie, he said: â€œsheâ€™s an awfully pretty girl, and whatâ€™s more, charming.â€

but  i  soon  ceased  paying  attention  to  this  trick  of  his;  i  was  basking  in  the
sunlight, which, i noticed, was making me feel much better. the sand was beginning
to stoke up underfoot

 and, though i was eager for a dip, i postponed it for a minute or
two  more.  at  last  i  said  to  masson:  â€œshall  we  go  in  now?â€  and  plunged.  masson

walked in gingerly and only began to swim when he was out of his depth. he swam
hand over hand and made slow headway, so i left him behind and caught up with
marie. the water was cold and i felt all the better for it. we swam a long way out,
marie and i, side by side, and it was pleasant feeling how our movements matched,
hers and mine, and how we were both in the same mood, enjoying every moment.

once we were out in the open, we lay on our backs an

d, as i gazed up at the sky, i
could feel the sun drawing up the film of salt water on my lips and cheeks. we saw
masson swim back to the beach and slump down on the sand under the sun. in the
distance he looked enormous, like a stranded whale. then marie proposed that we
should  swim  tandem.  she  went  ahead  and  i  put  my  arms  round  her  waist,  from
behind, and while she drew me forward with her arm strokes, i kicked out behind to
help us on.

that sound of little splashes had been in my ears for so long that i began to feel iâ€™d
had enough of it. so i let go of marie and swam back at an easy pace, tak

ing long,
deep  breaths.  when  i  made  the  beach  i  stretched  myself  belly  downward  beside
masson, resting my face on the sand. i told him â€œit was fineâ€ here, and he agreed.
presently  marie  came  back.  i  raised  my  head  to  watch  her  approach.  she  was
glistening with brine and holding her hair back. then she lay down beside me, and
what with the combined warmth of our bodies and the sun, i felt myself dropping off
to sleep.

after  a  while  marie  tugged  my  arm.  and  said  masson  had  gone  to  his  place;  it
must be nearly lunchtime. i rose at once, as i was feeling hun

gry, but marie told me i
hadnâ€™t kissed her once since the early morning. that was soâ€”though iâ€™d wanted to,
several times. â€œletâ€™s go into the water again,â€ she said, and we ran into the sea and
lay flat amongst the ripples for a moment. then we swam a few strokes, and when
we were almost out of our depth she flung her arms round me and hugged me. i felt
her legs twining round mine, and my senses tingled.

when we got back, masson was on the steps of his bungalow, shouting to us to
come. i told him i was ravenously hungry, and he promptly turned to his wife and
said heâ€™d taken quite a fancy to me. the bread was excellent, and i had my full share
of the fish. then came some steak and potato chips. none of us spoke while eating.
masson drank a lot of wine and kept refilling my glass the moment it was empty. by
the time coffee was handed round i was feeling slightly muzzy, and i started smoking
one cigarette after another

. masson, raymond, and i discussed a plan of spending the
whole of august on the beach together, sharing expenses.

suddenly  marie  exclaimed:  â€œi  say!  do  you  know  the  time?  itâ€™s  only  half-past

eleven!â€

we were all surprised at that, and masson remarked that weâ€™d had a very early

lunch, but really lunch was a movable feast, you had it when you felt like it.

this set marie laughing, i donâ€™t know why. i suspect sheâ€™d drunk a bit too much.

then masson asked if iâ€™d like to come with him for a stroll on the beach.
â€œmy wife always has a nap after lunch,â€ he said. â€œpersonally i find it doesnâ€™t agree
with me; what i need is a short walk. iâ€™m always telling her itâ€™s much better

health. but, of course, sheâ€™s entitled to her own opinion.â€

marie proposed to stay and help with the washing up. mme masson smiled and
said that, in that case, the first thing was to get the men out of the way. so we went
out together, the three of us.

the light was almost vertical and the glare from the water seared oneâ€™s eyes. the
beach was quite deserted now. one could hear a faint tinkle of knives and forks and
crockery in the shacks and bungalows lining the foreshore. heat was welling up from
the rocks, and one could hardly breathe.

at  first  raymond  and  masson  talked  of  things  and  people  i  didnâ€

™t  know.  i
gathered that theyâ€™d been acquainted for some time and had even lived together for a
while. we went down to the waterâ€™s edge and walked along it; now and then a longer
wave wet our canvas shoes. i wasnâ€™t thinking of anything, as all that sunlight beating
down on my bare head made me feel half asleep.

just then raymond said something to masson that i didnâ€™t quite catch. but at the
same moment i noticed two arabs in blue dungarees a long way down the beach,
coming  in  our  direction.  i  gave  raymond  a  look  and  he  nodded,  saying,  â€œthatâ€™s
him.â€  we  walked  steadily  on.  masson  wondered  how  theyâ€™d  managed  to  track  us
here. my impression was that they had seen us taking the bus and noticed marieâ€™s
oilcloth bathing bag; but i didnâ€™t say anything.

though the arabs walked quite slowly, they were much nearer

already. we didnâ€™t

change our pace, but raymond said:

â€œlisten! if thereâ€™s a roughhouse, you, masson, take on the second one. iâ€™ll tackle
the  fellow  whoâ€™s  after  me.  and  you,  meursault,  stand  by  to  help  if  another  one
comes up, and lay him out.â€

i said, â€œright,â€ and masson put his hands in his pockets.
the  sand  was  as  hot  as  fire,  and  i  could  have  sworn  it  was  glowing  red.  the
distance between us and the arabs was steadily decreasing. when we were only a
few steps away the arabs halted. masson and i slowed down, while raymond went
straight up to his man. i couldnâ€™t hear what he said, but i saw the native lowering his
head,  as  if  to  butt  him  in  the  chest.  raymond  lashed  out  promptly  and  shouted  to
masson to come. masson went up to

 all his might. the fellow fell flat into the water and stayed there some
seconds with bubbles coming up to the surface round his head. meanwhile raymond
had been slogging the other man, whose face was streaming with blood. he glanced
at me over his shoulder and shouted:

â€œjust you watch! i ainâ€™t finished with him yet!â€
â€œlook out!â€ i cried. â€œheâ€™s got a knife.â€



35

albert camus (cid:153) the stranger

i spoke too late. the man had gashed raymondâ€™s arm and his mouth as well.
masson sprang forward. the other arab got up from the water and placed himself
behind the fellow with the knife. we didnâ€™t dare to move. the two natives backed
away  slowly,  keeping  us  at  bay  with  the  knife  and  never  taking  their  eyes  off  us.
when  they  were  at  a  safe  distance  they  swung  round  and  took  to  their  heels.  we
stood  stock-still,  with  the  sunlight  beating  down  on  us.  blood  was  dripping  from
raymondâ€™s wounded arm, which he was squeezing hard above t

he elbow.

masson remarked that there was a doctor who always spent his sundays here, and
raymond said: â€œgood. letâ€™s go to him at once.â€ he could hardly get the words out,
as the blood from his other wound made bubbles in his mouth.

we each gave him an arm and helped him back to the bungalow. once we were
there he told us the wounds werenâ€™t so very deep and he could walk to where the
doctor was. marie had gone quite pale, and mme masson was in tears.

masson  and  raymond  went  off  to  the  doctorâ€™s  while  i  was  left  behind  at  the
bungalow to explain matters to the women. i didnâ€™t much relish the task and soon
dried up and started smoking, staring at the sea.

raymond came back at about half-past one, accompanied by masson. he had his
arm bandaged and a strip of sticking plaster on the corner of his mouth. the doctor
had assured him it was nothing serious, but he was looking very glum. masson tried
to make him laugh, but without success

.

presently raymond said he was going for a stroll on the beach. i asked him where
he proposed to go, and he mumbled something about â€œwanting to take the air.â€ weâ€”
masson and iâ€”then said weâ€™d go with him, but he flew into a rage and told us to
mind our own business. masson said we mustnâ€™t insist, seeing the state he was in.
however, when he went out, i followed him.

it was like a furnace outside, with the sunlight splintering into flakes of fire on the
sand and sea. we walked for quite a while, and i had an idea that raymond had a
definite idea where he was going; but probably i was mistaken about this.

at the end of the beach we came to a small stream that had cut a channel in the
sand, after coming out from behind a biggish rock. there we found our two arab

together toward the bench), the hurried reading of the charge sheet, in the course of
which  i  recognized  some  familiar  names  of  people  and  places;  then  some
supplementary questions put to my lawyer.

next, the judge announced that the court would call over the witness list. some of
the names read out by the clerk rather surprised me. from amongst the crowd, which
until  now  i  had  seen  as  a  mere  blur  of  faces,  rose,  one  after  the  other,  raymond,
masson, salamano, the doorkeeper from the home, old pÃ©rez, and marie, who gave
me a little nervous wave of her hand before following the others out by a side door. i
was thinking how strange it was i hadnâ€™t noticed any of them before when i heard the
last name called, that of cÃ©leste. as he rose, i noticed beside him the quaint little
woman with a mannish coat and brisk, decided air, who had shared my table at the
restaurant.  she  had  her  eyes  fixed  on  me,  i  noticed.  but  i  hadnâ€™t  tim

when he sat down there was the same dead silence. then all of a sudden marie
burst into tears. heâ€™d got it all wrong, she said; it wasnâ€™t a bit like that really, heâ€™d
bullied her into saying the opposite of what she meant. she knew me very well, and
she was sure i hadnâ€™t done anything really wrongâ€”and so on. at a sign from the
presiding judge, one of the court officers led her away, and the hearing continued.

hardly anyone seemed to listen to masson, the next witness. he stated that i was a
respectable young fellow; â€œand, whatâ€™s more, a very decent chap.â€ nor did they pay
any more attention to salamano, when he told them how kind iâ€™d always been to his
dog,  or  when,  in  answer  to  a  question  about  my  mother  and  myself,  he  said  that
mother and i had very little in common and that explained why iâ€™d fixed up for her
to  enter  the  home.  â€œyouâ€™ve  got  to  understand,â€  he  added.  â€œyouâ€™ve  got  to

ged; there was only one class of men, the
privileged class. all alike would be condemned to die one day; his turn, too, would
come like the othersâ€™. and what difference could it make if, after being charged with
murder, he were executed because he didnâ€™t weep at his motherâ€™s funeral, since it all
came  to  the  same  thing  in  the  end?  the  same  thing  for  salamanoâ€™s  wife  and  for
salamanoâ€™s dog. that little robot woman was as â€œguiltyâ€ as the girl from paris who
had married masson, or as marie, who wanted me to marry her. what did it matter if
raymond was as much my pal as cÃ©leste, who was a far worthier man? what did it
matter if at this very moment marie was kissing a new boy friend? as a condemned
man  himself,  couldnâ€™t  he  grasp  what  i  meant by that dark wind blowing from  my
