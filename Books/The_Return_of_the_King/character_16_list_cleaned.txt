[CHARACTER] - 
                    	the
son of denethor, brother of the deceased boromir, and future husband
of eowyn. [CHARACTER] appears confident and assured when frodo and sam
encounter him at ithilien, outside mordor. denethor's attempts to burn
[CHARACTER] alive are the extreme manifestations of the steward's suppression
of his dutiful son. in contrast to his father, [CHARACTER] displays
the depth of his nobility by immediately recognizing aragorn's long-awaited claim
to the throne of gondor.
