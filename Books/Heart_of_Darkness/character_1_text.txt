exercise. when a truckle-bed with a sick man (some invalid agent from
upcountry) was put in there, he exhibited a gentle annoyance. â€˜the
groans of this sick person,â€™ he said, â€˜distract my attention. and
without that it is extremely difficult to guard against clerical errors
in this climate.â€™

â€œone day he remarked, without lifting his head, â€˜in the interior you
will no doubt meet mr. kurtz.â€™ on my asking who mr. kurtz was, he
said he was a first-class agent; and seeing my disappointment at
this information, he added slowly, laying down his pen, â€˜he is a very
remarkable person.â€™ further questions elicited from him that mr. kurtz

that day.... he rose slowly. â€˜what a frightful row,â€™ he said. he
crossed the room gently to look at the sick man, and returning, said to
me, â€˜he does not hear.â€™ â€˜what! dead?â€™ i asked, startled. â€˜no, not yet,â€™
he answered, with great composure. then, alluding with a toss of the
head to the tumult in the station-yard, â€˜when one has got to make
correct entries, one comes to hate those savages--hate them to the
death.â€™ he remained thoughtful for a moment. â€˜when you see mr. kurtzâ€™
he went on, â€˜tell him from me that everything hereâ€™--he glanced at the
deck--â€™ is very satisfactory. i donâ€™t like to write to him--with those
messengers of ours you never know who may get hold of your letter--at
that central station.â€™ he stared at me for a moment with his mild,
bulging eyes. â€˜oh, he will go far, very far,â€™ he began again. â€˜he
will be a somebody in the administration before long. they, above--the
council in europe, you know--mean him to be.â€™

not know who was dead and who was alive, and how they got on--and so on,

a stick of sealing-wax, repeated several times that the situation was
â€˜very grave, very grave.â€™ there were rumours that a very important
station was in jeopardy, and its chief, mr. kurtz, was ill. hoped it was

exceptional man, of the greatest importance to the company; therefore

nigger was being beaten near by. they said he had caused the fire in
some way; be that as it may, he was screeching most horribly. i saw him,
later, for several days, sitting in a bit of shade looking very sick and
trying to recover himself; afterwards he arose and went out--and
the wilderness without a sound took him into its bosom again. as i
approached the glow from the dark i found myself at the back of two men,
talking. i heard the name of kurtz pronounced, then the words, â€˜take
advantage of this unfortunate accident.â€™ one of the men was the manager.
i wished him a good evening. â€˜did you ever see anything like it--eh? it
is incredible,â€™ he said, and walked off. the other man remained. he was
a first-class agent, young, gentlemanly, a bit reserved, with a forked
little beard and a hooked nose. he was stand-offish with the other
agents, and they on their side said he was the managerâ€™s spy upon them.

furious annoyance, he yawned. i rose. then i noticed a small sketch in
oils, on a panel, representing a woman, draped and blindfolded, carrying
a lighted torch. the background was sombre--almost black. the movement
of the woman was stately, and the effect of the torchlight on the face
was sinister.

â€œit arrested me, and he stood by civilly, holding an empty half-pint
champagne bottle (medical comforts) with the candle stuck in it. to my
question he said mr. kurtz had painted this--in this very station more
than a year ago--while waiting for means to go to his trading post.
â€˜tell me, pray,â€™ said i, â€˜who is this mr. kurtz?â€™

â€œâ€˜the chief of the inner station,â€™ he answered in a short tone, looking
away. â€˜much obliged,â€™ i said, laughing. â€˜and you are the brickmaker of
the central station. every one knows that.â€™ he was silent for a while.

risen. black figures strolled about listlessly, pouring water on

through the faint sounds of that lamentable courtyard, the silence of
the land went home to oneâ€™s very heart--its mystery, its greatness, the
amazing reality of its concealed life. the hurt nigger moaned feebly
somewhere near by, and then fetched a deep sigh that made me mend my
pace away from there. i felt a hand introducing itself under my arm.
â€˜my dear sir,â€™ said the fellow, â€˜i donâ€™t want to be misunderstood, and

that if i tried i could poke my forefinger through him, and would find
nothing inside but a little loose dirt, maybe. he, donâ€™t you see, had

it didnâ€™t bring any image with it--no more than if i had been told an

â€œone evening as i was lying flat on the deck of my steamboat, i heard
voices approaching--and there were the nephew and the uncle strolling
along the bank. i laid my head on my arm again, and had nearly lost

â€œi was broad awake by this time, but, lying perfectly at ease, remained
still, having no inducement to change my position. â€˜how did that ivory
come all this way?â€™ growled the elder man, who seemed very vexed. the
other explained that it had come with a fleet of canoes in charge of an
english half-caste clerk kurtz had with him; that kurtz had apparently
intended to return himself, the station being by that time bare of goods
and stores, but after coming three hundred miles, had suddenly

to go back, which he started to do alone in a small dugout with four
paddlers, leaving the half-caste to continue down the river with the
ivory. the two fellows there seemed astounded at anybody attempting such
a thing. they were at a loss for an adequate motive. as to me, i seemed
to see kurtz for the first time. it was a distinct glimpse: the dugout,
four paddling savages, and the lone white man turning his back suddenly
on the headquarters, on relief, on thoughts of home--perhaps; setting
his face towards the depths of the wilderness, towards his empty and
desolate station. i did not know the motive. perhaps he was just simply
a fine fellow who stuck to his work for its own sake. his name, you
understand, had not been pronounced once. he was â€˜that man.â€™ the
half-caste, who, as

few paces, and strolled back and forth at some little distance. i heard:

just as the manager was saying, â€˜no one, as far as i know, unless a
species of wandering trader--a pestilential fellow, snapping ivory
from the natives.â€™ who was it they were talking about now? i gathered in
snatches that this was some man supposed to be in kurtzâ€™s district, and
of whom the manager did not approve. â€˜we will not be free from unfair
competition till one of these fellows is hanged for an example,â€™
he said. â€˜certainly,â€™ grunted the other; â€˜get him hanged! why not?

â€œin a few days the eldorado expedition went into the patient wilderness,
that closed upon it as the sea closes over a diver. long afterwards the
news came that all the donkeys were dead. i know nothing as to the fate
of the less valuable animals. they, no doubt, like the rest of us, found
what they deserved. i did not inquire. i was then rather excited at
the prospect of meeting kurtz very soon. when i say very soon i mean
it comparatively. it was just two months from the day we left the creek
when we came to the bank below kurtzâ€™s station.

â€œgoing up that river was like traveling back to the earliest beginnings
of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were
kings. an empty stream, a great silence, an impenetrable forest. the air
was warm, thick, heavy, sluggish. there was no joy in the brilliance of
sunshine. the long stretches of the waterway

the little begrimed steamboat, like a sluggish beetle crawling on the

were small, the grimy beetle crawled on--which was just what you wanted
it to do. where the pilgrims imagined it crawled to i donâ€™t know.
to some place where they expected to get something. i bet! for me it
crawled towards kurtz--exclusively; but when the steam-pipes started
leaking we crawled very slow. the reaches opened before us and closed
behind, as if the forest had stepped leisurely across the water to bar
the way for our return. we penetrated deeper and deeper into the heart
of darkness. it was very quiet there. at night sometimes the roll of
drums behind the curtain of trees would run up the river and remain
sustained faintly, as if hovering in the air high over our heads, till
the first break of day. whether

the boiler would get angry through the greatness of his thirst, and take
a terrible vengeance. so he sweated and fired up and watched the glass
fearfully (with an impromptu charm, made of rags, tied to his arm, and
a piece of polished bone, as big as a watch, stuck flatways through his
lower lip), while the wooded banks slipped past us slowly, the short
noise was left behind, the interminable miles of silence--and we crept
on, towards kurtz. but the snags were thick, the water was treacherous
and shallow, the boiler seemed indeed to have a sulky devil in it, and
thus neither that fireman nor i had any time to peer into our creepy
thoughts.

â€œsome fifty miles below the inner station we came upon a hut of reeds,
an inclined and melancholy pole, with the unrecognizable tatters of
what had been a flag of some sort flying from it, and a neatly stacked
wood-pile. this was unexpected. we came to the bank, and on the stack of

â€œthe current was more rapid now, the steamer seemed at her last gasp,
the stern-wheel flopped languidly, and i caught myself listening on
tiptoe for the next beat of the boat, for in sober truth i expected the
wretched thing to give up every moment. it was like watching the last
flickers of a life. but still we crawled. sometimes i would pick out a
tree a little way ahead to measure our progress towards kurtz by, but
i lost it invariably before we got abreast. to keep the eyes so long
on one thing was too much for human patience. the manager displayed
a beautiful resignation. i fretted and fumed and took to arguing with
myself whether or no i would talk openly with kurtz; but before i could
come to any conclusion it occurred to me that my speech or my silence,
indeed any action of mine, would be a mere futility. what did it matter

gets sometimes such a flash of insight. the essentials of this affair
lay deep under the surface, beyond my reach, and beyond my power of
meddling.

â€œtowards the evening of the second day we judged ourselves about eight
miles from kurtzâ€™s station. i wanted to push on; but the manager looked
grave, and told me the navigation up there was so dangerous that it
would be advisable, the sun being very low already, to wait where we
were till next morning. moreover, he pointed out that if the warning
to approach cautiously were to be followed, we must approach in
daylight--not at dusk or in the dark. this was sensible enough. eight
miles meant nearly three hoursâ€™ steaming for us, and i could also see

ripple on an unfathomable enigma, a mystery greater--when i thought
of it--than the curious, inexplicable note of desperate grief in this
savage clamour that had swept by us on the river-bank, behind the blind
whiteness of the fog.

â€œtwo pilgrims were quarrelling in hurried whispers as to which bank.
â€˜left.â€™ â€˜no, no; how can you? right, right, of course.â€™ â€˜it is very
serious,â€™ said the managerâ€™s voice behind me; â€˜i would be desolated if
anything should happen to mr. kurtz before we came up.â€™ i looked at him,
and had not the slightest doubt he was sincere. he was just the kind of
man who would wish to preserve appearances. that was his restraint. but
when he muttered something about going on at once, i did not even take
the trouble to answer him. i knew, and he knew, that it was impossible.

authorize you to take all the risks,â€™ he said, after a short silence.
â€˜i refuse to take any,â€™ i said shortly; which was just the answer he
expected, though its tone might have surprised him. â€˜well, i must defer
to your judgment. you are captain,â€™ he said with marked civility. i
turned my shoulder to him in sign of my appreciation, and looked into
the fog. how long would it last? it was the most hopeless lookout. the
approach to this kurtz grubbing for ivory in the wretched bush was beset
by as many dangers as though he had been an enchanted princess sleeping
in a fabulous castle. â€˜will they attack, do you think?â€™ asked the
manager, in a confidential tone.

â€œi did not think they would attack, for several obvious reasons. the
thick fog was one. if they left the bank in their canoes they would get
lost in it, as we would be if we attempted to move. still, i had also
judged the jungle of both banks quite impenetrable--and yet

besides, all i said, though it sounded extravagant, was absolutely
true to fact. what we afterwards alluded to as an attack was really an
attempt at repulse. the action was very far from being aggressive--it
was not even defensive, in the usual sense: it was undertaken under the
stress of desperation, and in its essence was purely protective.

â€œit developed itself, i should say, two hours after the fog lifted, and
its commencement was at a spot, roughly speaking, about a mile and a
half below kurtzâ€™s station. we had just floundered and flopped round a
bend, when i saw an islet, a mere grassy hummock of bright green, in the
middle of the stream. it was the only thing of the kind; but as we opened
the reach more, i perceived it was the head of a long sand-bank, or
rather of a chain of shallow patches stretching down the middle of the
river. they were discoloured, just awash, and the whole lot was seen
just under the water, exactly as a manâ€™s backbone is seen running down

swiftly into vacant glassiness. â€˜can you steer?â€™ i asked the agent
eagerly. he looked very dubious; but i made a grab at his arm, and he
understood at once i meant him to steer whether or no. to tell you
the truth, i was morbidly anxious to change my shoes and socks. â€˜he is
dead,â€™ murmured the fellow, immensely impressed. â€˜no doubt about it,â€™
said i, tugging like mad at the shoe-laces. â€˜and by the way, i suppose
mr. kurtz is dead as well by this time.â€™

â€œfor the moment that was the dominant thought. there was a sense of
extreme disappointment, as though i had found out i had been striving
after something altogether without a substance. i couldnâ€™t have been
more disgusted if i had travelled all this way for the sole purpose of
talking with mr. kurtz. talking with... i flung one shoe overboard,

or below the ground in the whole country. â€˜mostly fossil,â€™ the manager
had remarked, disparagingly. it was no more fossil than i am; but they
call it fossil when it is dug up. it appears these niggers do bury the
tusks sometimes--but evidently they couldnâ€™t bury this parcel deep
enough to save the gifted mr. kurtz from his fate. we filled the
steamboat with it, and had to pile a lot on the deck. thus he could
see and enjoy as long as he could see, because the appreciation of this
favour had remained with him to the last. you should have heard him say,

it could speak english to me. the original kurtz had been educated

but too high-strung, i think. seventeen pages of close writing he had
found time for! but this must have been before his--let us say--nerves,
went wrong, and caused him to preside at certain midnight dances ending
with unspeakable rites, which--as far as i reluctantly gathered
from what i heard at various times--were offered up to him--do you
understand?--to mr. kurtz himself. but it was a beautiful piece
of writing. the opening paragraph, however, in the light of later
information, strikes me now as ominous. he began with the argument
that we whites, from the point of development we had arrived at, â€˜must
necessarily appear to them [savages] in the nature of supernatural
beings--we approach them with the might of a deity,â€™ and so on, and so
on. â€˜by the simple exercise of our will we can exert a power for good

was a kind of partnership. he steered for me--i had to look after him, i
worried about his deficiencies, and thus a subtle bond had been created,
of which i only became aware when it was suddenly broken. and the
intimate profundity of that look he gave me when he received his hurt
remains to this day in my memory--like a claim of distant kinship
affirmed in a supreme moment.

no restraint--just like kurtz--a tree swayed by the wind. as soon as
i had put on a dry pair of slippers, i dragged him out, after first
jerking the spear out of his side, which operation i confess i performed
with my eyes shut tight. his heels leaped together over the little
doorstep; his shoulders were pressed to my breast; i hugged him from
behind desperately. oh! he was heavy, heavy; heavier than any man on
earth, i should imagine. then without more ado i tipped him overboard.

some startling trouble. besides, i was anxious to take the wheel, the
man in pink pyjamas showing himself a hopeless duffer at the business.

â€œthis i did directly the simple funeral was over. we were going
half-speed, keeping right in the middle of the stream, and i listened
to the talk about me. they had given up kurtz, they had given up the
station; kurtz was dead, and the station had been burnt--and so on--and
so on. the red-haired pilgrim was beside himself with the thought that
at least this poor kurtz had been properly avenged. â€˜say! we must have
made a glorious slaughter of them in the bush. eh? what do you think?

way the tops of the bushes rustled and flew, that almost all the shots
had gone too high. you canâ€™t hit anything unless you take aim and fire
from the shoulder; but these chaps fired from the hip with their eyes
shut. the retreat, i maintained--and i was right--was caused by the
screeching of the steam whistle. upon this they forgot kurtz, and began
to howl at me with indignant protests.

â€œthe manager stood by the wheel murmuring confidentially about the
necessity of getting well away down the river before dark at all events,
when i saw in the distance a clearing on the riverside and the outlines
of some sort of building. â€˜whatâ€™s this?â€™ i asked. he clapped his hands
in wonder. â€˜the station!â€™ he cried. i edged in at once, still going
half-speed.

me to keep enough steam on the boiler to blow the whistle in case of any
trouble. â€˜one good screech will do more for you than all your rifles.

listen to him,â€™ he exclaimed with severe exaltation. â€˜but now--â€™ he
waved his arm, and in the twinkling of an eye was in the uttermost
depths of despondency. in a moment he came up again with a jump,
possessed himself of both my hands, shook them continuously, while he
gabbled: â€˜brother sailor... honour... pleasure... delight...

â€œthe pipe soothed him, and gradually i made out he had run away from
school, had gone to sea in a russian ship; ran away again; served some
time in english ships; was now reconciled with the arch-priest. he made
a point of that. â€˜but when one is young one must see things, gather
experience, ideas; enlarge the mind.â€™ â€˜here!â€™ i interrupted. â€˜you
can never tell! here i met mr. kurtz,â€™ he said, youthfully solemn and
reproachful. i held my tongue after that. it appears he had persuaded a
dutch trading-house on the coast to fit him out with stores and goods,
and had started for the interior with a light heart and no more idea of
what would happen to him than a baby. he had been wandering about that
river for nearly two years alone, cut off from everybody and everything.

if the absolutely pure, uncalculating, unpractical spirit of adventure

envied him the possession of this modest and clear flame. it seemed to
have consumed all thought of self so completely, that even while he
was talking to you, you forgot that it was he--the man before your

to kurtz, though. he had not meditated over it. it came to him, and
he accepted it with a sort of eager fatalism. i must say that to me it
appeared about the most dangerous thing in every way he had come upon so
far.

â€œthey had come together unavoidably, like two ships becalmed near
each other, and lay rubbing sides at last. i suppose kurtz wanted an

â€œon the contrary. it appears their intercourse had been very much broken
by various causes. he had, as he informed me proudly, managed to nurse
kurtz through two illnesses (he alluded to it as you would to some risky
feat), but as a rule kurtz wandered alone, far in the depths of the
forest. â€˜very often coming to this station, i had to wait days and
days before he would turn up,â€™ he said. â€˜ah, it was worth waiting
for!--sometimes.â€™ â€˜what was he doing? exploring or what?â€™ i asked. â€˜oh,

muttered something about the villages round that lake. â€˜kurtz got the
tribe to follow him, did he?â€™ i suggested. he fidgeted a little. â€˜they
adored him,â€™ he said. the tone of these words was so extraordinary that
i looked at him searchingly. it was curious to see his mingled eagerness
and reluctance to speak of kurtz. the man filled his life, occupied his
thoughts, swayed his emotions. â€˜what can you expect?â€™ he burst out; â€˜he

this man suffered too much. he hated all this, and somehow he couldnâ€™t
get away. when i had a chance i begged him to try and leave while there

he would remain; go off on another ivory hunt; disappear for weeks;

if i had heard him talk, only two days ago, i wouldnâ€™t dare hint at such
a thing.... i had taken up my binoculars while we talked, and was
looking at the shore, sweeping the limit of the forest at each side and
at the back of the house. the consciousness of there being people in
that bush, so silent, so quiet--as silent and quiet as the ruined house
on the hill--made me uneasy. there was no sign on the face of nature

desolate exclamations, completed by shrugs, in interrupted phrases, in
hints ending in deep sighs. the woods were unmoved, like a mask--heavy,
like the closed door of a prison--they looked with their air of hidden
knowledge, of patient expectation, of unapproachable silence. the
russian was explaining to me that it was only lately that mr. kurtz had
come down to the river, bringing along with him all the fighting men of
that lake tribe. he had been absent for several months--getting himself
adored, i suppose--and had come down unexpectedly, with the intention
to all appearance of making a raid either across the river or down
stream. evidently the appetite for more ivory had got the better of
the--what shall i say?--less material aspirations. however he had

returned deliberately to the first i had seen--and there it was, black,
dried, sunken, with closed eyelids--a head that seemed to sleep at the
top of that pole, and, with the shrunken dry lips showing a narrow
white line of the teeth, was smiling, too, smiling continuously at some
endless and jocose dream of that eternal slumber.

â€œi am not disclosing any trade secrets. in fact, the manager said
afterwards that mr. kurtzâ€™s methods had ruined the district. i have no
opinion on that point, but i want you clearly to understand that there
was nothing exactly profitable in these heads being there. they only
showed that mr. kurtz lacked restraint in the gratification of his
various lusts, that there was something wanting in him--some small
matter which, when the pressing need arose, could not be found under
his magnificent eloquence. whether he knew of this deficiency himself i

to him things about himself which he did not know, things of which he
had no conception till he took counsel with this great solitude--and the
whisper had proved irresistibly fascinating. it echoed loudly within him
because he was hollow at the core.... i put down the glass, and the
head that had appeared near enough to be spoken to seemed at once to
have leaped away from me into inaccessible distance.

â€œthe admirer of mr. kurtz was a bit crestfallen. in a hurried,
indistinct voice he began to assure me he had not dared to take

one bound to have been transported into some lightless region of subtle
horrors, where pure, uncomplicated savagery was a positive relief, being
something that had a right to exist--obviously--in the sunshine. the
young man looked at me with surprise. i suppose it did not occur to
him that mr. kurtz was no idol of mine. he forgot i hadnâ€™t heard any of
these splendid monologues on, what was it? on love, justice, conduct
of life--or what not. if it had come to crawling before mr. kurtz, he
crawled as much as the veriest savage of them all. i had no idea of the
conditions, he said: these heads were the heads of rebels. i shocked him
excessively by laughing. rebels! what would be the next definition i
was to hear? there had been enemies, criminals, workers--and these

suddenly he broke down. â€˜i donâ€™t understand,â€™ he groaned. â€˜iâ€™ve been

said. i resented bitterly the absurd danger of our situation, as if
to be at the mercy of that atrocious phantom had been a dishonouring
necessity. i could not hear a sound, but through my glasses i saw the
thin arm extended commandingly, the lower jaw moving, the eyes of
that apparition shining darkly far in its bony head that nodded with
grotesque jerks. kurtz--kurtz--that means short in german--donâ€™t it?
well, the name was as true as everything else in his life--and death.

body emerged from it pitiful and appalling as from a winding-sheet. i

â€œâ€˜if she had offered to come aboard i really think i would have tried to

life every day for the last fortnight to keep her out of the house. she
got in one day and kicked up a row about those miserable rags i picked

it must have been that, for she talked like a fury to kurtz for an hour,
pointing at me now and then. i donâ€™t understand the dialect of this
tribe. luckily for me, i fancy kurtz felt too ill that day to care, or
there would have been mischief. i donâ€™t understand.... no--itâ€™s too
much for me. ah, well, itâ€™s all over now.â€™

â€œat this moment i heard kurtzâ€™s deep voice behind the curtain: â€˜save

save you. you are interrupting my plans now. sick! sick! not so sick as

and lead me aside. â€˜he is very low, very low,â€™ he said. he considered it
necessary to sigh, but neglected to be consistently sorrowful. â€˜we have
done all we could for him--havenâ€™t we? but there is no disguising the
fact, mr. kurtz has done more harm than good to the company. he did
not see the time was not ripe for vigorous action. cautiously,
cautiously--thatâ€™s my principle. we must be cautious yet. the district
is closed to us for a time. deplorable! upon the whole, the trade will
suffer. i donâ€™t deny there is a remarkable quantity of ivory--mostly

position is--and why? because the method is unsound.â€™ â€˜do you,â€™ said i,

seemed to me i had never breathed an atmosphere so vile, and i turned
mentally to kurtz for relief--positively for relief. â€˜nevertheless i
think mr. kurtz is a remarkable man,â€™ i said with emphasis. he started,
dropped on me a heavy glance, said very quietly, â€˜he _was_,â€™ and turned
his back on me. my hour of favour was over; i found myself lumped along
with kurtz as a partisan of methods for which the time was not ripe:
i was unsound! ah! but it was something to have at least a choice of
nightmares.

as if i also were buried in a vast grave full of unspeakable secrets. i
felt an intolerable weight oppressing my breast, the smell of the damp
earth, the unseen presence of victorious corruption, the darkness of an
impenetrable night.... the russian tapped me on the shoulder. i heard
him mumbling and stammering something about â€˜brother seaman--couldnâ€™t

i suspect that for him mr. kurtz was one of the immortals. â€˜well!â€™ said
i at last, â€˜speak out. as it happens, i am mr. kurtzâ€™s friend--in a
way.â€™

n the starred darkness, real enough to
make me get up for the purpose of having a look round. on the hill a
big fire burned, illuminating fitfully a crooked corner of the
station-house. one of the agents with a picket of a few of our blacks,
armed for the purpose, was keeping guard over the ivory; but deep within
the forest, red gleams that wavered, that seemed to sink and rise from
the ground amongst confused columnar shapes of intense blackness, showed
the exact position of the camp where mr. kurtzâ€™s adorers were keeping
their uneasy vigil. the monotonous beating of a big drum filled the air
with muffled shocks and a lingering vibration. a steady droning sound of
many men chanting each to himself some weird incantation came out from
the black, flat wall of the woods as the humming of bees comes out of
a hive, and had a strange narcotic effect upon my half-awake senses.
i believe i dozed off leaning over the rail, till an abrupt burst of
yells, an overwhelming outbreak of a pent-up and m

ysterious frenzy, woke
me up in a bewildered wonder. it was cut short all at once, and the
low droning went on with an effect of audible and soothing silence. i
glanced casually into the little cabin. a light was burning within, but
mr. kurtz was not there.

â€œi think i would have raised an outcry if i had believed my eyes. but i
didnâ€™t believe them at first--the thing seemed so impossible. the fact
is i was completely unnerved by a sheer blank fright, pure abstract
terror, unconnected with any distinct shape of physical danger. what
made this emotion so overpowering was--how shall i define it?--the
moral shock i received, as if something altogether monstrous,
intolerable to thought and odious to the soul, had been thrust upon me

second, and
then the usual sense of commonplace, deadly danger, the possibility of
a sudden onslaught and massacre, or something of the kind, which i saw
impending, was positively welcome and composing. it pacified me, in
fact, so much that i did not raise an alarm.

â€œthere was an agent buttoned up inside an ulster and sleeping on a chair
on deck within three feet of me. the yells had not awakened him; he
snored very slightly; i left him to his slumbers and leaped ashore.
i did not betray mr. kurtz--it was ordered i should never betray him--it
was written i should be loyal to the nightmare of my choice. i was
anxious to deal with this shadow by myself alone--and to this day i
donâ€™t know why i was so jealous of sharing with any one the peculiar
blackness of that experience.

â€œas soon as i got on the bank i saw a trail--a broad trail through the
grass. i remember the exultation with which i said to myself, â€˜he canâ€™t
walk--he is crawling on all-fours--iâ€™ve got him.â€™ the grass was

â€œi kept to the track though--then stopped to listen. the night was very
clear; a dark blue space, sparkling with dew and starlight, in which
black things stood very still. i thought i could see a kind of motion
ahead of me. i was strangely cocksure of everything that night. i
actually left the track and ran in a wide semicircle (i verily believe
chuckling to myself) so as to get in front of that stir, of that motion
i had seen--if indeed i had seen anything. i was circumventing kurtz as
though it had been a boyish game.

â€œi came upon him, and, if he had not heard me coming, i would have
fallen over him, too, but he got up in time. he rose, unsteady, long,
pale, indistinct, like a vapour exhaled by the earth, and swayed
slightly, misty and silent before me; while at my back the fires loomed
between the trees, and the murmur of many voices issued from the forest.
i had cut him off cleverly; but when actually confronting him i seemed
to come to my senses, i saw the danger in

again, they faced the river, stamped their feet, nodded their horned
heads, swayed their scarlet bodies; they shook towards the fierce
river-demon a bunch of black feathers, a mangy skin with a pendent
tail--something that looked a dried gourd; they shouted periodically
together strings of amazing words that resembled no sounds of human
language; and the deep murmurs of the crowd, interrupted suddenly, were
like the responses of some satanic litany.

â€œwe had carried kurtz into the pilot-house: there was more air there.
lying on the couch, he stared through the open shutter. there was an
eddy in the mass of human bodies, and the woman with helmeted head and
tawny cheeks rushed out to the very brink of the stream. she put out her
hands, shouted something, and all that wild mob took up the shout in a
roaring chorus of articulated, rapid, breathless utterance.

and i could see nothing more for smoke.

â€œthe brown current ran swiftly out of the heart of darkness, bearing us
down towards the sea with twice the speed of our upward progress; and
kurtzâ€™s life was running swiftly, too, ebbing, ebbing out of his heart

no vital anxieties now, he took us both in with a comprehensive and
satisfied glance: the â€˜affairâ€™ had come off as well as could be wished.

and fame revolving obsequiously round his unextinguishable gift of noble
and lofty expression. my intended, my station, my career, my
ideas--these were the subjects for the occasional utterances of elevated
sentiments.

 the shade of the original kurtz frequented the bedside of
the hollow sham, whose fate it was to be buried presently in the mould
of primeval earth. but both the diabolic love and the unearthly hate of
the mysteries it had penetrated fought for the possession of that
soul satiated with primitive emotions, avid of lying fame, of sham
distinction, of all the appearances of success and power.

like one and the same reach, monotonous bends that were exactly alike,
slipped past the steamer with their multitude of secular trees looking
patiently after this grimy fragment of another world, the forerunner
of change, of conquest, of trade, of massacres, of blessings. i looked
ahead--piloting. â€˜close the shutter,â€™ said kurtz suddenly one day; â€˜i
canâ€™t bear to look at this.â€™ i did so. there was a silence. â€˜oh, but i
will wring your heart yet!â€™ he cried at the invisible wilderness.

â€œwe broke down--as i had expected--and had to lie up for repairs at the
head of an island. this delay was the first thing that shook kurtzâ€™s
confidence. one morning he gave me a packet of papers and a
photograph--the lot tied together with a shoe-string. â€˜keep this for
me,â€™ he said. â€˜this noxious foolâ€™ (meaning the m

the mess-room, and i took my place opposite the manager, who lifted his
eyes to give me a questioning glance, which i successfully ignored.
he leaned back, serene, with that peculiar smile of his sealing the
unexpressed depths of his meanness. a continuous shower of small flies
streamed upon the lamp, upon the cloth, upon our hands and faces.
suddenly the managerâ€™s boy put his insolent black head in the doorway,
and said in a tone of scathing contempt:

â€œâ€˜mistah kurtz--he dead.â€™

â€œall the pilgrims rushed out to see. i remained, and went on with my
dinner. i believe i was considered brutally callous. however, i did not
eat much. there was a lamp in there--light, donâ€™t you know--and outside
it was so beastly, beastly dark. i went no more near the remarkable man
who had pronounced a judgment upon the adventures of his soul on this
earth. the voice was gone. what else had been there? but i am of course
aware that next day the pilgrims buried something in a

not. i remained to dream the nightmare out to the end, and to show my
loyalty to kurtz once more. destiny. my destiny! droll thing life
is--that mysterious arrangement of merciless logic for a futile purpose.
the most you can hope from it is some knowledge of yourself--that comes
too late--a crop of unextinguishable regrets. i have wrestled with
death. it is the most unexciting contest you can imagine. it takes place
in an impalpable greyness, with nothing underfoot, with nothing around,
without spectators, without clamour, without glory, without the great
desire of victory, with

out the great fear of defeat, in a sickly
atmosphere of tepid scepticism, without much belief in your own right,
and still less in that of your adversary. if such is the form of
ultimate wisdom, then life is a greater riddle than some of us think it
to be. i was within a hairâ€™s breadth of the last opportunity for
pronouncement, and i found with humiliation that probably i would have
nothing to say. this is the reason why i affirm that kurtz was a
remarkable man. he had something to say. he said it. since i had peeped
over the edge myself, i understand better the meaning of his stare, that
could not see the flame of the candle, but was wide enough to embrace
the whole universe, piercing enough to penetrate all the hearts that
beat in the darkness. he had summed up--he had judged. â€˜the horror!â€™ he
was a remarkable man. after all, this was the expression of some sort of
belief; it had candour, it had conviction, it had a vibratin

his is the whole difference; perhaps all the
wisdom, and all truth, and all sincerity, are just compressed into that
inappreciable moment of time in which we step over the threshold of the
invisible. perhaps! i like to think my summing-up would not have been a
word of careless contempt. better his cry--much better. it was an
affirmation, a moral victory paid for by innumerable defeats, by
abominable terrors, by abominable satisfactions. but it was a victory!
that is why i have remained loyal to kurtz to the last, and even beyond,
when a long time after i heard once more, not his own voice, but the
echo of his magnificent eloquence thrown to me from a soul as
translucently pure as a cliff of crystal.

â€œno, they did not bury me, though there is a period of time which i
remember mistily, with a shuddering wonder, like a passage through some
inconceivable world that had no hope in it and no desire. i found myself
back in the sepulchral city resenting the sight of people hurrying

 stupid importance. i daresay i was
not very well at that time. i tottered about the streets--there were
various affairs to settle--grinning bitterly at perfectly respectable
persons. i admit my behaviour was inexcusable, but then my temperature
was seldom normal in these days. my dear auntâ€™s endeavours to â€˜nurse up
my strengthâ€™ seemed altogether beside the mark. it was not my strength
that wanted nursing, it was my imagination that wanted soothing. i kept
the bundle of papers given me by kurtz, not knowing exactly what to do
with it. his mother had died lately, watched over, as i was told, by
his intended. a clean-shaved man, with an official manner and wearing
gold-rimmed spectacles, called on me one day and made inquiries, at
first circuitous, afterwards suavely pressing, about what he was pleased
to denominate certain â€˜documents.â€™ i was not surprised, because i had
had two rows with the manager on the subject out there. i had refused
to give up the smallest scrap out of that p

ackage, and i took the same
attitude with the spectacled man. he became darkly menacing at last,
and with much heat argued that the company had the right to every bit of
information about its â€˜territories.â€™ and said he, â€˜mr. kurtzâ€™s
knowledge of unexplored regions must have been necessarily extensive
and peculiar--owing to his great abilities and to the deplorable
circumstances in which he had been placed: therefore--â€™ i assured him
mr. kurtzâ€™s knowledge, however extensive, did not bear upon the problems
of commerce or administration. he invoked then the name of science. â€˜it
would be an incalculable loss if,â€™ etc., etc. i offered him the report
on the â€˜suppression of savage customs,â€™ with the postscriptum torn
off. he took it up eagerly, but ended by sniffing at it with an air
of contempt. â€˜this is not what we had a right to expect,â€™ he remarked.
â€˜expect nothing else,â€™ i said. â€˜there are only private letters.â€™

withdrew upon some threat of legal proceedings, and i saw him no more;
but another fellow, calling himself kurtzâ€™s cousin, appeared two days
later, and was anxious to hear all the details about his dear relativeâ€™s
last moments. incidentally he gave me to understand that kurtz had
been essentially a great musician. â€˜there was the making of an immense
success,â€™ said the man, who was an organist, i believe, with lank grey
hair flowing over a greasy coat-collar. i had no reason to doubt
his statement; and to this day i am unable to say what was kurtzâ€™s
profession, whether he ever had any--which was the greatest of his
talents. i had taken him for a painter who wrote for the papers, or else
for a journalist who could paint--but even the cousin (who took snuff

g the interview) could not tell me what he had been--exactly. he
was a universal genius--on that point i agreed with the old chap, who
thereupon blew his nose noisily into a large cotton handkerchief and
withdrew in senile agitation, bearing off some family letters and
memoranda without importance. ultimately a journalist anxious to know
something of the fate of his â€˜dear colleagueâ€™ turned up. this visitor
informed me kurtzâ€™s proper sphere ought to have been politics â€˜on the
popular side.â€™ he had furry straight eyebrows, bristly hair cropped
short, an eyeglass on a broad ribbon, and, becoming expansive, confessed
his opinion that kurtz really couldnâ€™t write a bit--â€˜but heavens! how
that man could talk. he electrified large meetings. he had faith--donâ€™t
you see?--he had the faith. he could get himself to believe
anything--anything. he would have been a splendid leader of an extreme
party.â€™ â€˜what par

he struck me as beautiful--i mean she had a beautiful
expression. i know that the sunlight can be made to lie, too, yet one
felt that no manipulation of light and pose could have conveyed the
delicate shade of truthfulness upon those features. she seemed ready to
listen without mental reservation, without suspicion, without a thought
for herself. i concluded i would go and give her back her portrait
and those letters myself. curiosity? yes; and also some other feeling
perhaps. all that had been kurtzâ€™s had passed out of my hands: his soul,
his body, his station, his plans, his ivory, his career. there remained
only his memory and his intended--and i wanted to give that up, too,
to the past, in a way--to surrender personally all that remained of him
with me to that oblivion which is the last word of our common fate. i
donâ€™t defend myself. i had no clear perception of what it was i really
wanted. perhaps it was an impulse of unconscious loyalty, or the
fulfilment of one of those ironic ne

â€œi listened. the darkness deepened. i was not even sure whether he had
given me the right bundle. i rather suspect he wanted me to take care
of another batch of his papers which, after his death, i saw the manager
examining under the lamp. and the girl talked, easing her pain in the
certitude of my sympathy; she talked as thirsty men drink. i had heard
that her engagement with kurtz had been disapproved by her people. he
wasnâ€™t rich enough or something. and indeed i donâ€™t know whether he had
not been a pauper all his life. he had given me some reason to infer
that it was his impatience of comparative poverty that drove him out
there.

â€œâ€˜... who was not his friend who had heard him speak once?â€™ she was
saying. â€˜he drew men towards him by what was best in them.â€™ she looked
at me with intensity. â€˜it is the gift of the great,â€™ she went on, and

a light sigh and then my heart stood still, stopped dead short
by an exulting and terrible cry, by the cry of inconceivable triumph and
of unspeakable pain. â€˜i knew it--i was sure!â€™... she knew. she was
sure. i heard her weeping; she had hidden her face in her hands. it
seemed to me that the house would collapse before i could escape, that
the heavens would fall upon my head. but nothing happened. the heavens
do not fall for such a trifle. would they have fallen, i wonder, if i
had rendered kurtz that justice which was his due? hadnâ€™t he said he
wanted only justice? but i couldnâ€™t. i could not tell her. it would have
been too dark--too dark altogether....â€

marlow ceased, and sat apart, indistinct and silent, in the pose of a
meditating buddha. nobody moved for a time. â€œwe have lost the first of

barred by a black bank of clouds, and the tranquil waterway leading to
the uttermost ends of the earth flowed som
