the land was up for sell again, grandpa had bought two hundred acres of it, and in 19i8, after the first two
hundred acres had been paid off, he had bought another two hundred, it was good rich land, much of it still virgin forest, and
there was no debt on half of it. but there was a mortgage on the two hundred acres bought in 1918 and there were taxes on the
full four hundred, and for the past three years there had not been enough money from the cotton to pay both and live on too.

younger brother claude emerged a moment later, smiling weakly as if it pained him to do so. neither boy had on shoes, and
their sunday clothing, patched and worn, hung loosely upon their frail frames. the avery family
