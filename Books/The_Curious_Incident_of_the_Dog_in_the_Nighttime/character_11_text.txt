opher. let's sit you up and get your clothes off and get you into the bath, 
ok? i'm going to have to touch you, but it's going to be all right." 
 
then he lifted me up and made me sit on the side of the bed. he took my jumper and my shirt off and put 
them on the bed. then he made me stand up and walk through to the bathroom. and i didn't scream. and 
i didn't fight. and i didn't hit him.

when  i  was  little  and  i  first  went  to  school,  my  main  teacher  was  called  julie,  because  siobhan  hadn't 
started working at the school then. she only started working at the school when i was twelve. 
 
and one day julie sat down at a desk next to me  and put  a tube of smarties on the desk,  and she said, 
"christopher, what do you think is in here?" 
 
and i said, "smarties."

i decided that it was a kind of puzzle, and if something is a puzzle there is always a way of solving it. 
 
it's like computers. people think computers are different from people because they don't have minds, even 
though, in the turing test, computers can have conversations with people about the weather and wine and 
what italy is like, and they can even tell jokes.

and then they would stop noticing anything because they would be thinking something else like, "oh, it 
is very beautiful here," or "i'm worried that i might have left the gas cooker on," or "i wonder if julie has 
given birth yet."12 
 
but if i am standing in a field in the countryside i notice everything. for example, i remember standing in 
a  field  on  wednesday,  15  june  1994,  because  father  and  mother  and  i  were  driving  to  dover  to  get  a 
ferry to france and we did what father called taking the scenic route, which means going by little roads 
and stopping for lunch in a pub garden, and i had to stop to go for a wee, and i went into a field with cows 
in it and after i'd had a w
