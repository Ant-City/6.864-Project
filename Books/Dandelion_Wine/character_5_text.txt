ll back what the ravine was like, especially on those nights 
when walking home late across town, after seeing lon chaney's delicious fright the 
phantom of the opera, my brother skip would run ahead and hide under the ravine-creek 
bridge like the lonely one and leap out and grab me, shrieking, so i ran, fell, and ran 
again, gibbering all the way home. that was great stuff. 

along the way i came upon and collided, through word-association, with old and true 
friendships. i borrowed my friend john huff from my childhood in arizona and shipped 
him east to green town so that i could say good-bye to him properly. 

along the way, i sat me down to breakfasts, lunches, and dinners with the long dead 
and much loved. for i was a boy who did indeed love his parents and grandparents and 
his brother, even when that brother "ditched" him. 

along the way, i found myself in the basement working the wine-press for my father, 
or on the front porch independence night helping my uncle bion load and fire

morning avenues below, two old women would glide their electric green machine, waving 
at all the dogs. "mr. tridden, run to the carbarn!" soon, scattering hot blue sparks above 
it, the town trolley would sail the rivering brick streets. 

"ready john huff, charlie woodman?" whispered douglas to the street of children. 
"ready!" to baseballs sponged deep in wet lawns, to rope swings hung empty in trees. 

"mom, dad, tom, wake up." 

clock alarms tinkled faintly. the courthouse clock boomed. birds leaped from trees 
like a net thrown by his hand, singing. douglas, conducting an orchestra, pointed to the

 in lonely farm country, moved inward with the thrust of seasons. each night the 
wilderness, the meadows, the far country flowed down-creek through ravine and welled 
up in town with a smell of grass and water, and the town was disinhabited and dead and 
gone back to earth. and each morning a little more of the ravine edged up into town, 
threatening to swamp garages like leaking rowboats, devour ancient cars which had been 
left to the flaking mercies of rain and therefore rust. 

"hey! hey!" john huff and charlie woodman ran through the mystery of ravine and 
town and time. "hey!" 

douglas moved slowly down the path. the ravine was indeed the place where you 
came to look at the two things of life, the ways of man and the ways of the natural 
world. the town was, after all, only a large ship filled with constantly moving survivors, 
bailing out the grass, chipping away the rust. now and again a lifeboat, a shanty, kin to 
the mother ship, lost out to the quiet storm of seasons, sank down in

grandfather walked douglas and tom home. halfway there, charlie woodman and 
john huff and some other boys rushed by like a swarm of meteors, their gravity so huge 
they pulled douglas away from grandfather and tom and swept him off toward the 
ravine. 

"don't get lost, son!" 

"i won't ... i won't . . ." 

the boys plunged into darkness. 

tom and grandfather walked the rest of the way in silence, except when they turned 
in at home and tom said, "boy, a happiness machine— hot diggety!" 

"don't hold your breath," said grandpa. 

the courthouse clock struck eight.

the darkness pulled back, startled, shocked, angry. pulled back, losing its appetite at 
being so rudely interrupted as it prepared to feed. as the dark retreated like a wave on

"a time machine!" panted charlie woodman, pacing him. "mother's, scout's, injun's

"travels in the past and future?" john huff asked, easily circling them. 
"only in the past, but you can't have everything. here we are." 
charlie woodman pulled up at a hedge. 

douglas peered in at the old house. "heck, that's colonel freeleigh's place. can't be

"how-de-do, boys." 

the boys said hello. 

"but—" said douglas. "where is the—?" 

"my gosh, you're dumb!" charlie jabbed douglas in the arm. he turned to the colonel. 
"you were saying, sir?" 

"was i?" murmured the old man. 

"the civil war," suggested john huff quietly. "does he remember that?" 

"do i remember?" said the colonel. "oh, i do, i do!" his voice trembled as he shut up 
his eyes again. "everything! except . . .which side i fought on . . ." 

"the color of your uniform—" charlie began.

"no," said the old man, deep under. "i don't remember anyone winning anywhere any

loses last asks for terms. all i remember is a lot of losing and sadness and nothing good 
but the end of it. the end of it, charles, that was a winning all to itself, having nothing to 
do with guns. but i don't suppose that's the kind of victory you boys mean for me to talk 
on." 

"antietam," said john huff. "ask about antietam." 
"i was there." 

the boys' eyes grew bright. "bull run, ask him bull run . . ." 
"i was there." softly. 
"what about shiloh?" 

"there's never been a year in my life i haven't thought, what a lovely name and what

things stayed near, things were at hand and would remain. 

it was such a fine day and then suddenly a cloud crossed the sky, covered the sun, 
and did not move again. 

john huff had been speaking quietly for several minutes. now douglas stopped on the 
path and looked over at him.

"did you say you were— going away?"

looked at it.

douglas felt the earth move under his feet and saw their shadows move off the grass 
and color the air. 

he swallowed hard, then gave a screaming yell, pulled back his fist, shot the indoor 
ball whistling in the sky. "last one home's a rhino's behind!" 

they pounded down the tracks, laughing, flailing the air. there went john huff, not 
touching the ground at all. and here came douglas, touching it all the time. 



it was seven o'clock, supper over, and the boys gathering one by one from the sound 
of their house doors slammed and their parents crying to them not to slam the doors. 
douglas and tom and charlie and john stood among half a dozen others and it was time 
for hide-and-seek and statues. 

"just one game," said john. "then i got to go home. the train leaves at nine. who's 
going to be nt?" 

"me," said douglas

douglas looked at john for a long moment. "start running," he cried. 

the boys scattered, yelling. john backed away, then turned and began to lope. 
douglas counted slowly. he let them run far, spread out, separate each to his own small 
world. when they had got their momentum up and were almost out of sight he took a 
deep breath. 

"statues!" 

everyone froze. 

very quietly douglas moved across the lawn to where john huff stood like an iron deer 
in the twilight. 

far away, the other boys stood hands up, faces grimaced, eyes bright as stuffed 
squirrels. 

but here was john, alone and motionless and no one rushing or making a great outcry 
to spoil this moment.

"second harvest of the summer. june's on the shelf. here's july. now, just-august up

saw the other numbered bottles waiting there, one like another, in no way different, all
