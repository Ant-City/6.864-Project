an  once  jested,  "created  and  annihilated,  created  and  annihilated—
what a waste of time."2 since the borrowing and repaying on average cancel each other out, an empty
region  of  space  looks  calm  and  placid  when  examined  with  all  but  microscopic  precision.  the
uncertainty principle, however, reveals that macroscopic averaging obscures a wealth of microscopic
activity.3 as we will see shortly, this frenzy is the obstacle to merging general relativity and quantum
mechanics.

quantum field theory

over  the  course  of  the  1930s  and  1940s  theoretical  physicists,  led  by  the  likes  of  paul  dirac,
wolfgang pauli, julian schwinger, freeman dyson, sin-itiro tomonaga, and feynman, to name a few,
struggled  relentlessly  to  find  a  mathematical  formalism  capable  of  dealing  with  this  microscopic
obstreperousness.  they  found  that  schrödinger's  quantum  wave  equation  (mentioned  in  chapter  4)
was actually only an approximate description of microscopic physics—an a

gauge symmetry

you may have realized that the odd man out in our discussion of the quantum theory of the forces of
nature is gravity. given the successful approach physicists have used with the other three forces, you
might suggest that physicists seek a quantum field theory of the gravitational force—a theory in which

recall that the gravitational force allows us to declare that all observers—regardless of their
state of motion—are on absolutely equal footing. even those whom we would normally think of as
accelerating  may  claim  to  be  at  rest,  since  they  can  attribute  the  force  they  feel  to  their  being
immersed in a gravitational field. in this sense, gravity enforces the symmetry: it ensures the equal
validity of all possible observational

 applies to the weak and electromagnetic forces, showing that their existence, too, is bound
up with yet other gauge symmetries—the so-called weak and electromagnetic gauge symmetries. and

hence, all four forces are directly associated with principles of symmetry.

this common feature of the four forces would seem to bode well for the suggestion made at the
beginning  of  this  section.  namely,  in  our  effort  to  incorporate  quantum  mechanics  into  general
relativity we should seek a quantum field theory of the gravitational force, much as physicists have
discovered successful quantum field theories of the other three forces. over the years, such reasoning
has inspired a prodigious and distinguished group of physicists to follow this path vigorously, but the
terrain has proven to be fraught with danger, and no one has succeeded in traversing it completely.
let's see why.

ertheless, the major initial impact of the work of ramond, and also of neveu and schwarz,
was not actually in string theory. by 1973, the physicists julius wess and bruno zumino realized that
supersymmetry—the new symmetry emerging from the reformulation of string theory—was applicable
even to theories based on point particles. they rapidly made important strides toward incorporating
supersymmetry  into  the  framework  of  point-particle  quantum  field  theory. and  since,  at  the  time,
quantum field theory was the central rage of the mainstream particle-physics community—with string
theory increasingly becoming a subject on the fringe—the insights of wess and zumino launched a
tremendous amount of subsequent research on what has come to be called supersymmetric quantum
field theory. the supersymmetric standard model, discussed in the preceding section, is one of the
crowning theoretical achievements of these pursuits; we now see that, through historical twists and
turns, even this point-parti

ein and others continued, now and then, to dabble with the possibility of extra curled-up
dimensions, but it quickly came to be an enterprise on the outskirts of theoretical physics.

in a real sense, kaluza's idea was way ahead of its time. the 1920s marked the start of a bull
market for theoretical and experimental physics concerned with understanding the basic laws of the
microworld.  theorists  had  their  hands  full  as  they  sought  to  develop  the  structure  of  quantum
mechanics and quantum field theory. experimentalists had the detailed properties of the atom as well

that neutrinos do have a tiny but nonzero mass. second, there are certain hypothetical processes that
are forbidden by the standard model, but that may be allowed by string theory. among these are the
possible  disintegration  of  the  proton  (don't  worry,  such  disintegration,  if  true,  would  happen  very
slowly) and the possible transmutations and decays of various combinations of quarks, in violation of
certain long-established properties of point-particle quantum field theory.20 these kinds of processes
are  especially  interesting  because  their  absence  from  conventional  theory  makes  them  sensitive
signals  of  physics  that  cannot  be  accounted  for  without  invoking  new  theoretical  principles.  if
observed,  any  one  of  these  processes  would  provide  fertile  ground  for  string  theory  to  offer  an
explanation. third, for certain choices of the calabi-yau shape there are particular patterns of string

eories changed dramatically. as emphasized repeatedly, if we examine a string with
the precision available currently and for the foreseeable future, it looks like a point particle. we can
make  this  informal  remark  precise:  when  studying  low-energy  processes  in  string  theory—those
processes that do not have enough energy to probe the ultramicroscopic, extended nature of the string
—we can approximate a string by a structureless point particle, using the framework of point-particle
quantum field theory. we cannot use this approximation when dealing with short-distance or high-
energy processes because we know that the extended nature of the string is crucial to its ability to
resolve the conflicts between general relativity and quantum mechanics that a point-particle theory
cannot. but at low enough energies—large enough distances—these problems are not encountered,
and such an approximation is often made for the sake of calculational convenience.

fundamentally, two-dimensional membranes living in an eleven-dimensional universe.

topic  is  currently  under  intense  scrutiny.  we  know  from  figures  12.7  and  12.8  that  the  eleven-
dimensional theory contains two-dimensional extended objects—two-dimensional membranes. and
as we shall soon discuss, extended objects of other dimensions play an important role as well. but

ever  earlier  times.  since  the  universe  gets  ever  smaller,  hotter,  and  denser  as  we  push  back,  an
accurate quantum-mechanical description of matter and the forces becomes increasingly important. as
we have seen from other viewpoints in earlier chapters, point-particle quantum field theory works
until typical particle energies are around the planck energy. in a cosmological context, this occurred
when the whole of the known universe fit within a planck-sized nugget, yielding a density so great that
it strains one's ability to find a fitting metaphor or an enlightening analogy: the density of the universe
at  the  planck  time  was  simply colossal.  at  such  energies  and  densities  gravity  and  quantum

this  state  the  universe  was  far  more  symmetric  than  it  is  today.  like  the  homogeneity  that  follows
when a collection of disparate metals is heated to a smooth molten liquid, the significant differences
between  the  forces  as  we  now  observe  them  were  all  erased  by  the  extremes  of  energy  and
temperature encountered in the very early universe. but as time went by and the universe expanded
and cooled, the formalism of quantum field theory shows that this symmetry would have been sharply
reduced through a number of rather abrupt steps, ultimately leading to the comparatively asymmetric
form with which we are familiar.

it's not hard to understand the physics behind such reduction of symmetry, or symmetry breaking,

makes.  instead,  we  have  to  extract  such  predictions  using  approximation  methods  based  on  a
