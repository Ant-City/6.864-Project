[CHARACTER] 
probably the first nonwhite character to be given a realistic,
individualized, and humane portrayal in the english novel, [CHARACTER]
has a huge literary and cultural importance. if crusoe represents
the first colonial mind in fiction, then [CHARACTER] represents not just
a caribbean tribesman, but all the natives of america, asia, and
africa who would later be oppressed in the age of european imperialism.
at the moment when crusoe teaches [CHARACTER] to call him "master" [CHARACTER] becomes
an enduring political symbol of racial injustice in a modern world
critical of imperialist expansion. recent rewritings of the crusoe
story, like j. m. coetzee's foe and michel tournier's [CHARACTER], emphasize
the sad consequences of crusoe's failure to understand [CHARACTER] and
suggest how the tale might be told very differently from the native's
perspective.
	aside from his importance to our culture, [CHARACTER] is a
key figure within the context of the novel. in many ways he is the
most vibrant character in robinson crusoe, much
more charismatic and colorful than his master. indeed, defoe at
times underscores the contrast between crusoe's and [CHARACTER]'s personalities,
as when [CHARACTER], in his joyful reunion with his father, exhibits
far more emotion toward his family than crusoe. whereas crusoe never
mentions missing his family or dreams about the happiness of seeing
them again, [CHARACTER] jumps and sings for joy when he meets his father,
and this emotional display makes us see what is missing from crusoe's
stodgy heart. [CHARACTER]'s expression of loyalty in asking crusoe to
kill him rather than leave him is more heartfelt than anything crusoe
ever says or does. [CHARACTER]'s sincere questions to crusoe about the
devil, which crusoe answers only indirectly and hesitantly, leave
us wondering whether crusoe's knowledge of christianity is superficial
and sketchy in contrast to [CHARACTER]'s full understanding of his own
god benamuckee. in short, [CHARACTER]'s exuberance and emotional directness
often point out the wooden conventionality of crusoe's personality.
	despite [CHARACTER]'s subjugation, however, crusoe appreciates
[CHARACTER] much more than he would a mere servant. crusoe does not seem to
value intimacy with humans much, but he does say that he loves [CHARACTER],
which is a remarkable disclosure. it is the only time crusoe makes
such an admission in the novel, since he never expresses love for
his parents, brothers, sisters, or even his wife. the mere fact
that an englishman confesses more love for an illiterate caribbean
ex-cannibal than for his own family suggests the appeal of [CHARACTER]'s
personality. crusoe may bring [CHARACTER] christianity and clothing,
but [CHARACTER] brings crusoe emotional warmth and a vitality of spirit
that crusoe's own european heart lacks.
