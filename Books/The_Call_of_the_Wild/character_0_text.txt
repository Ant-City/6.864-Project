buck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that trouble
was brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tide-water dog, strong
of muscle and with warm, long hair, from puget sound to san diego.
because men, groping in the arctic darkness, had found a yellow metal,
and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the
find, thousands of men were rushing into the northland. these men wanted
dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong muscles by

buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed santa clara valley. judge
miller‚Äôs place, it was called. it stood back from the road, half hidden
among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide
cool veranda that ran around its four sides. the house was approached by
gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and
under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars. at the rear things were on
even a more spacious scale than at the front. there were great stables,

re a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-clad servants‚Äô
cottages, an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape arbors,
green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. then there was the pumping
plant for the artesian well, and the big cement tank where judge
miller‚Äôs boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot
afternoon.

and over this great demesne buck ruled. here he was born, and here he
had lived the four years of his life. it was true, there were other
dogs, there could not but be other dogs on so vast a place, but they did
not count. they came and went, resided in the populous kennels, or lived
obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of toots, the
japanese pug, or ysabel, the mexican hairless,--strange creatures that
rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground. on the other hand,
there were the fox terriers, a scor

e of them at least, who yelped
fearful promises at toots and ysabel looking out of the windows at them
and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops.

but buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. the whole realm was his.
he plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the judge‚Äôs sons;
he escorted mollie and alice, the judge‚Äôs daughters, on long twilight
or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the judge‚Äôs feet
before the roaring library fire; he carried the judge‚Äôs grandsons on his
back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their footsteps through
wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard, and even
beyon

d, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches. among the
terriers he stalked imperiously, and toots and ysabel he utterly
ignored, for he was king,--king over all creeping, crawling, flying
things of judge miller‚Äôs place, humans included.

his father, elmo, a huge st. bernard, had been the judge‚Äôs inseparable
companion, and buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father. he was
not so large,--he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds,--for his
mother, shep, had been a scotch shepherd dog. nevertheless, one hundred
and forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good
living and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right
royal fashion. during the four years since his puppyhood he had lived
the life of a sated aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was even
a trifle egotistical, as c

ountry gentlemen sometimes become because of
their insular situation. but he had saved himself by not becoming a mere
pampered house-dog. hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down
the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, as to the cold-tubbing
races, the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver.

and this was the manner of dog buck was in the fall of 1897, when the
klondike strike dragged men from all the world into the frozen north.
but buck did not read the newspapers, and he did not know that manuel,
one of the gardener‚Äôs helpers, was an undesirable acquaintance. manuel
had one besetting sin. he loved to play chinese lottery. also, in his
gambling, he had one besetting weakness--faith in a system; and this
made his damnation certain. for to play a system requires money, while
the wages of a gardener‚Äôs helper do not lap over the needs of a wife and
numerous progeny.

the judge was at a meeting of the raisin growers‚Äô associat

ion, and the
boys were busy organizing an athletic club, on the memorable night of
manuel‚Äôs treachery. no one saw him and buck go off through the orchard
on what buck imagined was merely a stroll. and with the exception of a
solitary man, no one saw them arrive at the little flag station known
as college park. this man talked with manuel, and money chinked between
them.

‚Äúyou might wrap up the goods before you deliver ‚Äòm,‚Äù the stranger said
gruffly, and manuel doubled a piece of stout rope around buck‚Äôs neck
under the collar.

‚Äútwist it, an‚Äô you‚Äôll choke ‚Äòm plentee,‚Äù said manuel, and the stranger
grunted a ready affirmative.

buck had accep

 credit for a wisdom that outreached his own. but when the ends
of the rope were placed in the stranger‚Äôs hands, he growled menacingly.
he had merely intimated his displeasure, in his pride believing that to
intimate was to command. but to his surprise the rope tightened around
his neck, shutting off his breath. in quick rage he sprang at the man,
who met him halfway, grappled him close by the throat, and with a deft
twist threw him over on his back. then the rope tightened mercilessly,
while buck struggled in a fury, his tongue lolling out of his mouth and
his great chest panting futilely. never in all his life had he been so
vilely treated, and never in all his life had he been so angry. but his
strength ebbed, his eyes glazed, and he knew nothing when the train was
flagged and the two men threw him into the baggage car.

the next he knew, he was dimly aware that his tongue was hurting and
that he was being jolted along in some kind of a conveyance. the hoarse
shriek of a locomotive wh

istling a crossing told him where he was. he
had travelled too often with the judge not to know the sensation of
riding in a baggage car. he opened his eyes, and into them came the
unbridled anger of a kidnapped king. the man sprang for his throat, but
buck was too quick for him. his jaws closed on the hand, nor did they
relax till his senses were choked out of him once more.

‚Äúyep, has fits,‚Äù the man said, hiding his mangled hand from the
baggageman, who had been attracted by the sounds of struggle. ‚Äúi‚Äôm
takin‚Äô ‚Äòm up for the boss to ‚Äòfrisco. a crack dog-doctor there thinks
that he can cure ‚Äòm.‚Äù

concerning that night‚Äôs ride, the man spoke most eloquently for himself,
in a little shed back of a saloon on the san francisco water

u less, so help me.‚Äù

‚Äúthat makes a hundred and fifty,‚Äù the saloon-keeper calculated; ‚Äúand
he‚Äôs worth it, or i‚Äôm a squarehead.‚Äù

the kidnapper undid the bloody wrappings and looked at his lacerated
hand. ‚Äúif i don‚Äôt get the hydrophoby--‚Äù

‚Äúit‚Äôll be because you was born to hang,‚Äù laughed the saloon-keeper.
‚Äúhere, lend me a hand before you pull your freight,‚Äù he added.

dazed, suffering intolerable pain from throat and tongue, with the life
half throttled out of him, buck attempted to face his tormentors. but he
was thrown down and choked repeatedly, till they succeeded in filing the
heavy brass collar from off his neck. then the rope was removed, and he
was flung into a cagelike crate.

there he lay for the remainder of the weary night, nursing his wrath and
wounded pride. he could not understand what it all meant. what did they
want with him, these strange men? why were they keeping him pent up in
this narrow crate? he did not know why, but he felt oppressed b

y the
vague sense of impending calamity. several times during the night he
sprang to his feet when the shed door rattled open, expecting to see the
judge, or the boys at least. but each time it was the bulging face of
the saloon-keeper that peered in at him by the sickly light of a tallow
candle. and each time the joyful bark that trembled in buck‚Äôs throat was
twisted into a savage growl.

but the saloon-keeper let him alone, and in the morning four men entered
and picked up the crate. more tormentors, buck decided, for they were
evil-looking creatures, ragged and unkempt; and he stormed and raged at
them through the bars. they only laughed and poked sticks at him, which
he promptly assailed with his teeth till he realized that that was what
they wanted. whereupon he lay down sullenly and allowed the crate to be
lifted into a wagon. th

en he, and the crate in which he was imprisoned,
began a passage through many hands. clerks in the express office took
charge of him; he was carted about in another wagon; a truck carried
him, with an assortment of boxes and parcels, upon a ferry steamer; he
was trucked off the steamer into a great railway depot, and finally he
was deposited in an express car.

for two days and nights this express car was dragged along at the tail
of shrieking locomotives; and for two days and nights buck neither ate
nor drank. in his anger he had met the first advances of the express
messengers with growls, and they had retaliated by teasing him. when he
flung himself against the bars, quivering and frothing, they laughed
at him and taunted him. they growled and barked like detestable dogs,
mewed, and flapped their arms and crowed. it was all very silly, he
knew; but therefore the more outrage to his dignity, and his anger waxed
and waxed. he did not mind the hunger so much, but the lack of wat

l for whoever first fell foul of him. his eyes turned
blood-shot, and he was metamorphosed into a raging fiend. so changed was
he that the judge himself would not have recognized him; and the express
messengers breathed with relief when they bundled him off the train at
seattle.

four men gingerly carried the crate from the wagon into a small,
high-walled back yard. a stout man, with a red sweater that sagged
generously at the neck, came out and signed the book for the driver.
that was the man, buck divined, the next tormentor, and he hurled
himself savagely against the bars. the man smiled grimly, and brought a
hatchet and a club.

‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt going to take him out now?‚Äù the driver asked.

‚Äúsure,‚Äù the man replied, driving the hatchet into the crate for a pry.

there was an instantaneous scattering of the four men who had carried
it in, and from safe perches on top the wall they prepared to watch the
performance.

buck rushed at the splintering wood, sinking his teeth into it, sur

ging
and wrestling with it. wherever the hatchet fell on the outside, he was
there on the inside, snarling and growling, as furiously anxious to get
out as the man in the red sweater was calmly intent on getting him out.

‚Äúnow, you red-eyed devil,‚Äù he said, when he had made an opening
sufficient for the passage of buck‚Äôs body. at the same time he dropped
the hatchet and shifted the club to his right hand.

and buck was truly a red-eyed devil, as he drew himself together for the
spring, hair bristling, mouth foaming, a mad glitter in his blood-shot
eyes. straight at the man he launched his one hundred and forty pounds
of fury, surcharged with the pent passion of two days and nights. in
mid air, just as his jaws were about to close on the man, he received
a shock that checked his body and brought his teeth together with an
agonizing clip. he whirled over, fetching the ground on his back and
side. he had nev

 the blood flowing from nose and mouth
and ears, his beautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver.
then the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on
the nose. all the pain he had endured was as nothing compared with the
exquisite agony of this. with a roar that was almost lionlike in its
ferocity, he again hurled himself at the man. but the man, shifting the
club from right to left, coolly caught him by the under jaw, at the same
time wrenching downward and backward. buck described a complete circle
in the air, and half of another, then crashed to the ground on his head
and chest.

for the last time he rushed. the man struck the shrewd blow he had
purposely withheld for so long, and buck crumpled up and went down,
knocked utterly senseless.

‚Äúhe‚Äôs no slouch at dog-breakin‚Äô, that‚Äôs wot i say,‚Äù one of the men on
the wall cried enthusiastically.

‚Äúdruther break cayuses any day, and twice on sundays,‚Äù was the reply of
the driver, as he climbed on the w

agon and started the horses.

buck‚Äôs senses came back to him, but not his strength. he lay where he
had fallen, and from there he watched the man in the red sweater.

‚Äú‚Äòanswers to the name of buck,‚Äô‚Äù the man soliloquized, quoting from the
saloon-keeper‚Äôs letter which had announced the consignment of the crate
and contents. ‚Äúwell, buck, my boy,‚Äù he went on in a genial voice, ‚Äúwe‚Äôve
had our little ruction, and the best thing we can do is to let it go at
that. you‚Äôve learned your place, and i know mine. be a good dog and all
‚Äòll go well and the goose hang high. be a bad dog, and i‚Äôll whale the
stuffin‚Äô outa you. understand?‚Äù

as he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded,
and though buck‚Äôs hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand,
he endured it without protest. when the man br

 law,
and he met the introduction halfway. the facts of life took on a fiercer
aspect; and while he faced that aspect uncowed, he faced it with all the
latent cunning of his nature aroused. as the days went by, other dogs
came, in crates and at the ends of ropes, some docilely, and some raging
and roaring as he had come; and, one and all, he watched them pass
under the dominion of the man in the red sweater. again and again, as he
looked at each brutal performance, the lesson was driven home to buck:
a man with a club was a lawgiver, a master to be obeyed, though not
necessarily conciliated. of this last buck was never guilty, though he
did see beaten dogs that fawned upon the man, and wagged their tails,
and licked his hand. also he saw one dog, that would neither conciliate
nor obey, finally killed in the struggle for mastery.

now and again men came, strangers, who talked excitedly, wheedlingly,
and in all kinds of fashions to the man in the red sweater. and at such
times that money pas

sed between them the strangers took one or more of
the dogs away with them. buck wondered where they went, for they never
came back; but the fear of the future was strong upon him, and he was
glad each time when he was not selected.

yet his time came, in the end, in the form of a little weazened man who
spat broken english and many strange and uncouth exclamations which buck
could not understand.

‚Äúsacredam!‚Äù he cried, when his eyes lit upon buck. ‚Äúdat one dam bully
dog! eh? how moch?‚Äù

‚Äúthree hundred, and a present at that,‚Äù was the prompt reply of the man
in the red sweater. ‚Äúand seem‚Äô it‚Äôs government money, you ain‚Äôt got no
kick coming, eh, perrault?‚Äù

perrault grinned. considering that the price of dogs had been boomed
skyward by the unwonted demand, it was not an unfair sum for so fine
an animal. the canadian government would be no loser, nor would its
despatches travel the slower. perrault knew dogs, and when he

looked at
buck he knew that he was one in a thousand--‚Äúone in ten t‚Äôousand,‚Äù he
commented mentally.

buck saw money pass between them, and was not surprised when curly, a
good-natured newfoundland, and he were led away by the little weazened
man. that was the last he saw of the man in the red sweater, and as
curly and he looked at receding seattle from the deck of the narwhal, it
was the last he saw of the warm southland. curly and he were taken below
by perrault and turned over to a black-faced giant called francois.
perrault was a french-canadian, and swarthy; but francois was a
french-canadian h

alf-breed, and twice as swarthy. they were a new kind
of men to buck (of which he was destined to see many more), and while
he developed no affection for them, he none the less grew honestly to
respect them. he speedily learned that perrault and francois were fair
men, calm and impartial in administering justice, and too wise in the
way of dogs to be fooled by dogs.

in the ‚Äòtween-decks of the narwhal, buck and curly joined two other
dogs. one of them was a big, snow-white fellow from spitzbergen who had
been brought away by a whaling captain, and who had later accompanied
a geological survey into the barrens. he was friendly, in a treacherous
sort of way, smiling into one‚Äôs face the while he meditated some
underhand trick, as, for instance, when he stole from buck‚Äôs food at the
first meal. as buck sprang to punish him, the lash of francois‚Äôs whip
sang through the air, reaching the culprit f

irst; and nothing remained
to buck but to recover the bone. that was fair of francois, he decided,
and the half-breed began his rise in buck‚Äôs estimation.

the other dog made no advances, nor received any; also, he did not
attempt to steal from the newcomers. he was a gloomy, morose fellow, and
he showed curly plainly that all he desired was to be left alone, and
further, that there would be trouble if he were not left alone. ‚Äúdave‚Äù
 he was called, and he ate and slept, or yawned between times, and took
interest in nothing, not even when the narwhal crossed queen charlotte

ossessed. when
buck and curly grew excited, half wild with fear, he raised his head as
though annoyed, favored them with an incurious glance, yawned, and went
to sleep again.

day and night the ship throbbed to the tireless pulse of the propeller,
and though one day was very like another, it was apparent to buck that
the weather was steadily growing colder. at last, one morning, the
propeller was quiet, and the narwhal was pervaded with an atmosphere of
excitement. he felt it, as did the other dogs, and knew that a change
was at hand. francois leashed them and brought them on deck. at the
first step upon the cold surface, buck‚Äôs feet sank into a white mushy
something very like mud. he sprang back with a snort. more of this white
stuff was falling through the air. he shook himself, but more of it fell

upon him. he sniffed it curiously, then licked some up on his tongue. it
bit like fire, and the next instant was gone. this puzzled him. he tried
it again, with the same result. the onlookers laughed uproariously, and
he felt ashamed, he knew not why, for it was his first snow.




chapter ii. the law of club and fang


buck‚Äôs first day on the dyea beach was like a nightmare. every hour was
filled with shock and surprise. he had been suddenly jerked from the
heart of civilization and flung into the heart of things primordial.
no lazy, sun-kissed life was this, with nothing to do but loaf and be
bored. here was neither peace, nor rest, nor a moment‚Äôs safety. all
was confusion and action, and every moment life and limb were in peril.
there was imperative need to be constantly alert; for these dogs and men
were no

near the log store, where she, in
her friendly way, made advances to a husky dog the size of a full-grown
wolf, though not half so large as she. there was no warning, only a leap
in like a flash, a metallic clip of teeth, a leap out equally swift, and
curly‚Äôs face was ripped open from eye to jaw.

it was the wolf manner of fighting, to strike and leap away; but there
was more to it than this. thirty or forty huskies ran to the spot and
surrounded the combatants in an intent and silent circle. buck did not
comprehend that silent intentness, nor the eager way with which they
were licking their chops. curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again
and leaped aside. he met her next rush with his chest, in a peculiar
fashion that tumbled her off her feet. she never regained them, this
was what the onlooking huskies had waited for. they closed in upon her,
snarling and yelping, and she was buried, screaming with agony, beneath
the bristling mass of bodies.

so sudden was it, and so unexpected, 
 
 ___________________________
 
that buck was taken aback. he saw
spitz run out his scarlet tongue in a way he had of laughing; and he saw
francois, swinging an axe, spring into the mess of dogs. three men
with clubs were helping him to scatter them. it did not take long. two
minutes from the time curly went down, the last of her assailants were
clubbed off. but she lay there limp and lifeless in the bloody, trampled
snow, almost literally torn to pieces, the swart half-breed standing
over her and cursing horribly. the scene often came

 back to buck to
trouble him in his sleep. so that was the way. no fair play. once down,
that was the end of you. well, he would see to it that he never went
down. spitz ran out his tongue and laughed again, and from that moment
buck hated him with a bitter and deathless hatred.

before he had recovered from the shock caused by the tragic passing
of curly, he received another shock. francois fastened upon him an
arrangement of straps and buckles. it was a harness, such as he had seen
the grooms put on the horses at home. and as he had seen horses work,
so he was set to work, hauling francois on a sled to the forest that
fringed the valley, and returning with a load of firewood. though his
dignity was sorely hurt by thus being made a draught animal, he was too
wise to rebel. he buckled down with a will and did his best, though
it was all new and strange. francois was stern, demanding instant
obedience, and by virtue of his whip recei

ving instant obedience;
while dave, who was an experienced wheeler, nipped buck‚Äôs hind quarters
whenever he was in error. spitz was the leader, likewise experienced,
and while he could not always get at buck, he growled sharp reproof now
and again, or cunningly threw his weight in the traces to jerk buck
into the way he should go. buck learned easily, and under the combined
tuition of his two mates and francois made remarkable progress. ere they
returned to camp he knew enough to stop at ‚Äúho,‚Äù to go ahead at ‚Äúmush,‚Äù
 to swing wide on the bends, and to keep clear of the wheeler when the
loaded sled shot downhill at their heels.

‚Äút‚Äôree vair‚Äô good dogs,‚Äù francois told perrault. ‚Äúdat buck, heem pool
lak hell. i tich heem queek as anyt‚Äôing.‚Äù

by afternoon, perrault, who was in a hurry to be on the trail with
 
 ___________________________
 
 his
despatches, returned with two more dogs. ‚Äúbillee‚Äù and ‚Äújoe‚Äù he called
them, two brothers, and true huskies both. sons of the one mother though
they were, they were as different as day and night. billee‚Äôs one fault
was his excessive good nature, while joe was the very opposite, sour and
introspective, with a perpetual snarl and a malignant eye. buck received
them in comradely fashion, dave ignored them, while spitz proceeded to
thrash first one and then the other. billee wagged his tail appeasingly,
turned to run when he saw that appeasement was of no avail, and cried
(still appeasingly) when spitz‚Äôs sharp teeth scored his flank. but no
matter how spitz circled, joe whirled around on his heels to face
him, mane bristling, ears laid back, lips writhing and snarling, jaws
clipping together as fast as he could snap, and eyes diabolically

ed upon the inoffensive and wailing
billee and drove him to the confines of the camp.

by evening perrault secured another dog, an old husky, long and lean
and gaunt, with a battle-scarred face and a single eye which flashed a
warning of prowess that commanded respect. he was called sol-leks, which
means the angry one. like dave, he asked nothing, gave nothing, expected
nothing; and when he marched slowly and deliberately into their midst,
even spitz left him alone. he had one peculiarity which buck was unlucky
enough to discover. he did not like to be approached on his blind side.
of this offence buck was unwittingly guilty, and the first knowledge he
had of his indiscretion was when sol-leks whirled upon him and slashed
his shoulder to the bone for three inches up and down. forever after
buck avoided his blind side, and to the last of their comradeship had
no more trouble. his only apparent ambition, like dave‚Äôs, was to be left
alone; though, as buck was afterward to learn, each of the

m possessed
one other and even more vital ambition.

that night buck faced the great problem of sleeping. the tent, illumined
by a candle, glowed warmly in the midst of the white plain; and when he,
as a matter of course, entered it, both perrault and francois bombarded
him with curses and cooking utensils, till he recovered from his
consternation and fled ignominiously into the outer cold. a chill wind
was blowing that nipped him sharply and bit with especial venom into his
wounded shoulder. he lay down on the snow and attempted to sleep,
but the frost soon dro

tent. suddenly the snow gave way beneath his fore legs
and he sank down. something wriggled under his feet. he sprang back,
bristling and snarling, fearful of the unseen and unknown. but a
friendly little yelp reassured him, and he went back to investigate. a
whiff of warm air ascended to his nostrils, and there, curled up under
the snow in a snug ball, lay billee. he whined placatingly, squirmed and
wriggled to show his good will and intentions, and even ventured, as a
bribe for peace, to lick buck‚Äôs face with his warm wet tongue.

another lesson. so that was the way they did it, eh? buck confidently
selected a spot, and with much fuss and waste effort proceeded to dig a
hole for himself. in a trice the heat from his body filled the confined
space and he was asleep. the day had been long and arduous, and he slept
soundly and comfortably, though he growled and barked and wrestled with
bad dreams.

nor did he open his eyes till roused by the noises of the waking camp.
at first he did not

he hair on his neck and shoulders
stood on end, and with a ferocious snarl he bounded straight up into
the blinding day, the snow flying about him in a flashing cloud. ere he
landed on his feet, he saw the white camp spread out before him and knew
where he was and remembered all that had passed from the time he went
for a stroll with manuel to the hole he had dug for himself the night
before.

a shout from francois hailed his appearance. ‚Äúwot i say?‚Äù the dog-driver
cried to perrault. ‚Äúdat buck for sure learn queek as anyt‚Äôing.‚Äù

perrault nodded gravely. as courier for the canadian government, bearing
important despatches, he was anxious to secure the best dogs, and he was
particularly gladdened by the possession of buck.

three more huskies were added to the team inside an hour, making a total
of nine, and before another quarter of an hour had passed they were in
harness and swinging up the trail toward the dyea canon. buck was
glad to be gone, and though the work was hard he fou

the change wrought in dave and sol-leks. they
were new dogs, utterly transformed by the harness. all passiveness and
unconcern had dropped from them. they were alert and active, anxious
that the work should go well, and fiercely irritable with whatever, by
delay or confusion, retarded that work. the toil of the traces seemed
the supreme expression of their being, and all that they lived for and
the only thing in which they took delight.

dave was wheeler or sled dog, pulling in front of him was buck, then
came sol-leks; the rest of the team was strung out ahead, single file,
to the leader, which position was filled by spitz.

buck had been purposely placed between dave and sol-leks so that he
might receive instruction. apt scholar that he was, they were equally
apt teachers, never allowing him to linger long in error, and enforcing
their teaching with their sharp teeth. dave was fair and very wise. he
never nipped buck without cause, and he never failed to nip him when he
stood in need of

it. as francois‚Äôs whip backed him up, buck found it
to be cheaper to mend his ways than to retaliate. once, during a brief
halt, when he got tangled in the traces and delayed the start, both
dave and solleks flew at him and administered a sound trouncing. the
resulting tangle was even worse, but buck took good care to keep the
traces clear thereafter; and ere the day was done, so well had he
mastered his work, his mates about ceased nagging him. francois‚Äôs whip
snapped less frequently, and perrault even honored buck by lifting up
his feet and carefully examining them.

it was a hard day‚Äôs run, up the canon, through sheep camp, past the
scales and the timber line, across glaciers and snowdrifts hundreds of
feet deep, and over the great chilcoot divide, which stands between
the salt water

north. they made good time down the chain of lakes which fills the
craters of extinct volcanoes, and late that night pulled into the huge
camp at the head of lake bennett, where thousands of goldseekers were
building boats against the break-up of the ice in the spring. buck made
his hole in the snow and slept the sleep of the exhausted just, but all
too early was routed out in the cold darkness and harnessed with his
mates to the sled.

that day they made forty miles, the trail being packed; but the next
day, and for many days to follow, they broke their own trail, worked
harder, and made poorer time. as a rule, perrault travelled ahead of
the team, packing the snow with webbed shoes to make it easier for them.

 exchanged places
with him, but not often. perrault was in a hurry, and he prided himself
on his knowledge of ice, which knowledge was indispensable, for the fall
ice was very thin, and where there was swift water, there was no ice at
all.

day after day, for days unending, buck toiled in the traces. always,
they broke camp in the dark, and the first gray of dawn found them
hitting the trail with fresh miles reeled off behind them. and always
they pitched camp after dark, eating their bit of fish, and crawling
to sleep into the snow. buck was ravenous. the pound and a half of
sun-dried salmon, which was his ration for each day, seemed to go
nowhere. he never had enough, and suffered from perpetual hunger pangs.
yet the other dogs, because they weighed less and were bor

him, he was not above taking what did not belong to him. he watched and
learned. when he saw pike, one of the new dogs, a clever malingerer and
thief, slyly steal a slice of bacon when perrault‚Äôs back was turned,
he duplicated the performance the following day, getting away with the
whole chunk. a great uproar was raised, but he was unsuspected; while
dub, an awkward blunderer who was always getting caught, was punished
for buck‚Äôs misdeed.

this first theft marked buck as fit to survive in the hostile northland
environment. it marked his adaptability, his capacity to adjust himself
to changing conditions, the lack of which would have meant swift and
terrible death. it marked, further, the decay or going to pieces of his
moral nature, a vain thing and a handicap in the ruthless struggle for
existence. it was all well enough in the southland, under the law of
love and fellowship, to respect private property and persona

l feelings;
but in the northland, under the law of club and fang, whoso took such
things into account was a fool, and in so far as he observed them he
would fail to prosper.

not that buck reasoned it out. he was fit, that was all, and
unconsciously he accommodated himself to the new mode of life. all his
days, no matter what the odds, he had never run from a fight. but
the club of the man in the red sweater had beaten into him a more
fundamental and primitive code. civilized, he could have died for a
moral consideration, say the defence of judge miller‚Äôs riding-whip; but
the completeness of his decivilization was now evidenced by his ability
to flee from the defence of a moral

cold, and dark.

thus, as token of what a puppet thing life is, the ancient song surged
through him and he came into his own again; and he came because men had
found a yellow metal in the north, and because manuel was a gardener‚Äôs
helper whose wages did not lap over the needs of his wife and divers
small copies of himself.




chapter iii. the dominant primordial beast


the dominant primordial beast was strong in buck, and under the fierce
conditions of trail life it grew and grew. yet it was a secret growth.
his newborn cunning gave him poise and control. he was too busy
adjusting himself to the new life to feel at ease, and not only did
he not pick fights, but he avoided them whenever possible. a certain
deliberateness characterized his attitude. he was not prone to rashness
and precipitate action; and in the bitter hatred between him and spitz
he betrayed no impatience, shunned all offensive acts.

on the

 other hand, possibly because he divined in buck a dangerous
rival, spitz never lost an opportunity of showing his teeth. he even
went out of his way to bully buck, striving constantly to start the
fight which could end only in the death of one or the other. early in
the trip this might have taken place had it not been for an unwonted
accident. at the end of this day they made a bleak and miserable camp
on the shore of lake le barge. driving snow, a wind that cut like a
white-hot knife, and darkness had forced them to grope for a camping
place. they could hardly have fared worse. at their backs rose a
perpendicular wall of rock, and perrault and francois

were compelled to
make their fire and spread their sleeping robes on the ice of the lake
itself. the tent they had discarded at dyea in order to travel light.
a few sticks of driftwood furnished them with a fire that thawed down
through the ice and left them to eat supper in the dark.

close in under the sheltering rock buck made his nest. so snug and warm
was it, that he was loath to leave it when francois distributed the
fish which he had first thawed over the fire. but when buck finished his
ration and returned, he found his nest occupied. a warning snarl told
him that the trespasser was spitz. till now buck had avoided trouble
with his enemy, but this was too much. the beast in him roared. he
sprang upon spitz with a fury which surprised them both, and spitz
particularly, for his whole experience with buck had gone to teach him
that his rival was an unusually timid dog, who managed to hold his own
only because of his great weight and size.

francois was surprised, too

, when they shot out in a tangle from the
disrupted nest and he divined the cause of the trouble. ‚Äúa-a-ah!‚Äù
 he cried to buck. ‚Äúgif it to heem, by gar! gif it to heem, the dirty
t‚Äôeef!‚Äù

spitz was equally willing. he was crying with sheer rage and eagerness
as he circled back and forth for a chance to spring in. buck was no less
eager, and no less cautious, as he likewise circled back and forth for
the advantage. but it was then that the unexpected happened, the thing
which projected their struggle for supremacy far into the future, past
many a weary mile of trail and toil.

an oath from perrault, the resounding impact of a club upon a bony
frame, and a shrill yelp of pain, heralded the breaking forth of
pandemonium. the camp was suddenly discovered to be alive with skulking
furry forms,--starving huskies,

four or five score of them, who had
scented the camp from some indian village. they had crept in while buck
and spitz were fighting, and when the two men sprang among them with
stout clubs they showed their teeth and fought back. they were crazed
by the smell of the food. perrault found one with head buried in the
grub-box. his club landed heavily on the gaunt ribs, and the grub-box
was capsized on the ground. on the instant a score of the famished
brutes were scrambling for the bread and bacon. the clubs fell upon them
unheeded. they yelped and howled under the rain of blows, but struggled

less madly till the last crumb had been devoured.

in the meantime the astonished team-dogs had burst out of their nests
only to be set upon by the fierce invaders. never had buck seen such
dogs. it seemed as though their bones would burst through their skins.
they were mere skeletons, draped loosely in draggled hides, with blazing
eyes and slavered fangs. but the hunger-madness made them terrifying,
irresistible. there was no opposing them. the team-dogs were swept back
against the cliff at the first onset. buck was beset by three huskies,
and in a trice his head and shoulders were ripped and slashed. the din
was frightful. billee was crying as usual. dave and sol-leks,

 dripping
blood from a score of wounds, were fighting bravely side by side. joe
was snapping like a demon. once, his teeth closed on the fore leg of
a husky, and he crunched down through the bone. pike, the malingerer,
leaped upon the crippled animal, breaking its neck with a quick flash of
teeth and a jerk, buck got a frothing adversary by the throat, and was
sprayed with blood when his teeth sank through the jugular. the warm
taste of it in his mouth goaded him to greater fierceness. he flung
himself upon another, and at the same time felt teeth sink into his own
throat. it was spitz, treacherously attacking from the side.

perrault and francois, having cleaned out their part of the camp,
hurried to save their sled-dogs. the wild wave of famished beasts rolled
back before them, and buck shook himself

free. but it was only for a
moment. the two men were compelled to run back to save the grub, upon
which the huskies returned to the attack on the team. billee, terrified
into bravery, sprang through the savage circle and fled away over the
ice. pike and dub followed on his heels, with the rest of the team
behind. as buck drew himself together to spring after them, out of the
tail of his eye he saw spitz rush upon him with the evident intention
of overthrowing him. once off his feet and under that mass of huskies,
there was no hope for him. but he braced himself to the shock of spitz‚Äôs
charge, then joined the flight out on the lake.

later, the nine team-dogs gathered together and sought shelter in the
forest. though unpursued, they were in a sorry plight. there was not
one who was not wounded in four or five

w zero, and each time he broke through he was
compelled for very life to build a fire and dry his garments.

nothing daunted him. it was because nothing daunted him that he had been
chosen for government courier. he took all manner of risks, resolutely
thrusting his little weazened face into the frost and struggling on from
dim dawn to dark. he skirted the frowning shores on rim ice that bent
and crackled under foot and upon which they dared not halt. once, the
sled broke through, with dave and buck, and they were half-frozen and
all but drowned by the time they were dragged out. the usual fire was
necessary to save them. they were coated solidly with ice, and the two
men kept them on the run around the fire, sweating and thawing, so close
that they were singed by the flames.

at another time spitz went through, dragging the whole team after him up
to buck, who strained backward with all his strength, his fore paws on
the slippery edge and the ice quivering and snapping all around. but

ed it by a miracle, while francois
prayed for just that miracle; and with every thong and sled lashing and
the last bit of harness rove into a long rope, the dogs were hoisted,
one by one, to the cliff crest. francois came up last, after the sled
and load. then came the search for a place to descend, which descent was
ultimately made by the aid of the rope, and night found them back on the
river with a quarter of a mile to the day‚Äôs credit.

by the time they made the hootalinqua and good ice, buck was played out.
the rest of the dogs were in like condition; but perrault, to make
up lost time, pushed them late and early. the first day they covered
thirty-five miles to the big salmon; the next day thirty-five more to
the little salmon; the third day forty miles, which brought them well up
toward the five fingers.

er or river man. all day long he
limped in agony, and camp once made, lay down like a dead dog. hungry as
he was, he would not move to receive his ration of fish, which francois
had to bring to him. also, the dog-driver rubbed buck‚Äôs feet for half
an hour each night after supper, and sacrificed the tops of his own
moccasins to make four moccasins for buck. this was a great relief, and
buck caused even the weazened face of perrault to twist itself into a
grin one morning, when francois forgot the moccasins and buck lay on his
back, his four feet waving appealingly in the air, and refused to budge
without them. later his feet grew hard to the trail, and the worn-out
foot-gear was thrown away.

at the pelly one morning, as they were harnessing up, dolly, who had
never been conspicuous for anything, went suddenly mad. she announced
her condition by a long, heartbreaking wolf howl tha

bristling with fear, then sprang straight for buck. he had never seen a
dog go mad, nor did he have any reason to fear madness; yet he knew
that here was horror, and fled away from it in a panic. straight away he
raced, with dolly, panting and frothing, one leap behind; nor could she
gain on him, so great was his terror, nor could he leave her, so great
was her madness. he plunged through the wooded breast of the island,
flew down to the lower end, crossed a back channel filled with rough ice
to another island, gained a third island, curved bac

k to the main river,
and in desperation started to cross it. and all the time, though he
did not look, he could hear her snarling just one leap behind. francois
called to him a quarter of a mile away and he doubled back, still one
leap ahead, gasping painfully for air and putting all his faith in that
francois would save him. the dog-driver held the axe poised in his hand,
and as buck shot past him the axe crashed down upon mad dolly‚Äôs head.

buck staggered over against the sled, exhausted, sobbing for breath,
helpless. this was spitz‚Äôs opportunity. he sprang upon buck, and twice
his teeth sank into his unresisting foe and ripped and tore the flesh to
the bone. then francois‚Äôs lash descended, and buck had the satisfaction
of watching spitz receive the worst whipping as yet administered to any
of the teams.

‚Äúone devil, dat spitz,‚Äù remarked perrault. ‚Äúsome dam day heem keel dat
buck.‚Äù

‚Äúdat buck two devils,‚Äù was francois‚Ä

buck i know for sure. lissen: some dam fine day heem get mad lak hell
an‚Äô den heem chew dat spitz all up an‚Äô spit heem out on de snow. sure. i
know.‚Äù

from then on it was war between them. spitz, as lead-dog and
acknowledged master of the team, felt his supremacy threatened by this
strange southland dog. and strange buck was to him, for of the many
southland dogs he had known, not one had shown up worthily in camp and
on trail. they were all too soft, dying under the toil, the frost, and
starvation. buck was the exception. he alone endured and prospered,
matching the husky in strength, savagery, and cunning. then he was a
masterful dog, and what made him dangerous was the fact that the club of
the man in the red sweater had knocked all blind pluck and rashness out
of his desire for mastery. he was preeminently

cunning, and could bide
his time with a patience that was nothing less than primitive.

it was inevitable that the clash for leadership should come. buck wanted
it. he wanted it because it was his nature, because he had been
gripped tight by that nameless, incomprehensible pride of the trail and
trace--that pride which holds dogs in the toil to the last gasp, which
lures them to die joyfully in the harness, and breaks their hearts
if they are cut out of the harness. this was the pride of dave as
wheel-dog, of sol-leks as he pulled with all his strength; the pride
that laid hold of them at break of camp, transforming them from sour and
sullen bru
 
 ___________________________
 
tes into straining, eager, ambitious creatures; the pride
that spurred them on all day and dropped them at pitch of camp at night,
letting them fall back into gloomy unrest and uncontent. this was the
pride that bore up spitz and made him thrash the sled-dogs who blundered
and shirked in the traces or hid away at harness-up time in the morning.
likewise it was this pride that made him fear buck as a possible
lead-dog. and this was buck‚Äôs pride, too.

he openly threatened the other‚Äôs leadership. he came between him and the
shirks he should have punished. and he did it deliberately. one night
there was a heavy snowfall, and in the morning pike, the malingerer,
did not appear. he was securely hidden in his nest under a foot of snow.
francois called him and sought him in vain. spitz was wild with wrath.
he raged through the camp, smelling and digging in every likely
place, snarling so frightfully that pike heard and shivered

in his
hiding-place.

but when he was at last unearthed, and spitz flew at him to punish him,
buck flew, with equal rage, in between. so unexpected was it, and so
shrewdly managed, that spitz was hurled backward and off his feet. pike,
who had been trembling abjectly, took heart at this open mutiny,
and sprang upon his overthrown leader. buck, to whom fair play was a
forgotten code, likewise sprang upon spitz. but francois, chuckling at
the incident while unswerving in the administration of justice, brought
his lash down upon buck with all his might. this failed to drive buck
from his prostrate rival, and the butt of the whip was brought into
play. half-stunned by the blow, buck was knocked backward and the lash
laid upon him again and again, while spitz soundly punished the many
times offending pike.

in the days that followed, as 
 
 ___________________________
 
dawson grew closer and closer, buck still
continued to interfere between spitz and the culprits; but he did it
craftily, when francois was not around, with the covert mutiny of buck,
a general insubordination sprang up and increased. dave and sol-leks
were unaffected, but the rest of the team went from bad to worse.
things no longer went right. there was continual bickering and jangling.
trouble was always afoot, and at the bottom of it was buck. he kept
francois busy, for the dog-driver was in constant apprehension of the
life-and-death struggle between the two which he knew must take place
sooner or later; and on more than one night the sounds of quarrelling
and strife among the other dogs turned him out of his sleeping robe,
fearful that buck and spitz were at it.

but the opportunity did not present itself, and they pulled into dawson
one dreary afternoon with the great fight still to come. here were many
men, and countless dogs, a

nd buck found them all at work. it seemed the
ordained order of things that dogs should work. all day they swung up
and down the main street in long teams, and in the night their jingling
bells still went by. they hauled cabin logs and firewood, freighted up
to the mines, and did all manner of work that horses did in the santa
clara valley. here and there buck met southland dogs, but in the main
they were the wild wolf husky breed. every night, regularly, at nine, at
twelve, at three, they lifted a nocturnal song, a weird and eerie chant,
in which it was buck‚Äôs delight to join.

with the aurora borealis flaming coldly overhead, or the stars leaping
in the frost dance, and the land numb and frozen under its pall of snow,
this song of the huskies might have been the defiance of life, only it
was pitched in minor key, with long-drawn wailings and half

-sobs, and
was more the pleading of life, the articulate travail of existence. it
was an old song, old as the breed itself--one of the first songs of the
younger world in a day when songs were sad. it was invested with the woe
of unnumbered generations, this plaint by which buck was so strangely
stirred. when he moaned and sobbed, it was with the pain of living that
was of old the pain of his wild fathers, and the fear and mystery of the
cold and dark that was to them fear and mystery. and that he should be
stirred by it marked the completeness with which he harked back through
the ages of fire and roof to the raw beginnings of life in the howling
ages.

seven days from the time they pulled into dawson, they dropped down the
steep bank by the barracks to the yukon trai

em in thorough trim. the trail they had broken into the country was
packed hard by later journeyers. and further, the police had arranged
in two or three places deposits of grub for dog and man, and he was
travelling light.

they made sixty mile, which is a fifty-mile run, on the first day; and
the second day saw them booming up the yukon well on their way to pelly.
but such splendid running was achieved not without great trouble and
vexation on the part of francois. the insidious revolt led by buck
had destroyed the solidarity of the team. it no longer was as one dog
leaping in the traces. the encouragement buck gave the rebels led them
into all kinds of petty misdemeanors. no more was spitz a leader greatly
to be feared. the old awe departed, and they grew equal to challenging
his authority. pike robbed him of half a fish one night, and gulped
it down under the protection of buck. another night dub and joe fought
spitz and made him forego the punishment they deserved. and even
billee, th

e good-natured, was less good-natured, and whined not half
so placatingly as in former days. buck never came near spitz without
snarling and bristling menacingly. in fact, his conduct approached that
of a bully, and he was given to swaggering up and down before spitz‚Äôs
very nose.

the breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs in their
relations with one another. they quarrelled and bickered more than ever
among themselves, till at times the camp was a howling bedlam. dave and
sol-leks alone were unaltered, though they were made irritable by the
unending squabbling. francois s
 
 ___________________________
 
wore strange barbarous oaths, and stamped
the snow in futile rage, and tore his hair. his lash was always singing
among the dogs, but it was of small avail. directly his back was turned
they were at it again. he backed up spitz with his whip, while buck
backed up the remainder of the team. francois knew he was behind all the
trouble, and buck knew he knew; but buck was too clever ever again to be
caught red-handed. he worked faithfully in the harness, for the toil
had become a delight to him; yet it was a greater delight slyly to
precipitate a fight amongst his mates and tangle the traces.

at the mouth of the tahkeena, one night after supper, dub turned up a
snowshoe rabbit, blundered it, and missed. in a second the whole team
was in full cry. a hundred yards away was a camp of the northwest
police, with fifty dogs, huskies all, who joined the chase. the
 
 ___________________________
 
 rabbit
sped down the river, turned off into a small creek, up the frozen bed of
which it held steadily. it ran lightly on the surface of the snow, while
the dogs ploughed through by main strength. buck led the pack, sixty
strong, around bend after bend, but he could not gain. he lay down low
to the race, whining eagerly, his splendid body flashing forward, leap
by leap, in the wan white moonlight. and leap by leap, like some pale
frost wraith, the snowshoe rabbit flashed on ahead.

there is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life, and beyond which life
cannot rise. and such is the paradox of living, this ecstasy comes when

 up and out of himself in a sheet of flame; it comes to the
soldier, war-mad on a stricken field and refusing quarter; and it came
to buck, leading the pack, sounding the old wolf-cry, straining after
the food that was alive and that fled swiftly before him through the
moonlight. he was sounding the deeps of his nature, and of the parts of
his nature that were deeper than he, going back into the womb of time.
he was mastered by the sheer surging of life, the tidal wave of being,
the perfect joy of each separate muscle, joint, and sinew in that it was
everything that was not death, that it was aglow and rampant, expressing

of dead matter that did not move.

but spitz, cold and calculating even in his supreme moods, left the pack
and cut across a narrow neck of land where the creek made a long bend
around. buck did not know of this, and as he rounded the bend, the frost
wraith of a rabbit still flitting before him, he saw another and larger
frost wraith leap from the overhanging bank into the immediate path of
the rabbit. it was spitz. the rabbit could not turn, and as the white
teeth broke its back in mid air it shrieked as loudly as a stricken man
may shriek. at sound of this, the cry of life plunging down from life‚Äôs
apex in the grip of death, the fall pack at buck‚Äôs heels raised a hell‚Äôs
cho

rus of delight.

buck did not cry out. he did not check himself, but drove in upon spitz,
shoulder to shoulder, so hard that he missed the throat. they rolled
over and over in the powdery snow. spitz gained his feet almost as
though he had not been overthrown, slashing buck down the shoulder and
leaping clear. twice his teeth clipped together, like the steel jaws of
a trap, as he backed away for better footing, with lean and lifting lips
that writhed and snarled.

in a flash buck knew it. the time had come. it was to the death. as
they circled about, snarling, ears laid back, keenly watchful for the
advantage, the scene came to buck with a sense of familiarity. he seemed
to remember it all,--the white woods, and earth, and moonlight, and the
thrill of battle. over the whiteness and silence brooded a ghostly calm.
there was not the faintest whisper of air--nothing moved, not a leaf
quivered, the visible breaths of the dogs rising slowly and lingering in
the frosty air. t

hey had made short work of the snowshoe rabbit, these
dogs that were ill-tamed wolves; and they were now drawn up in an
expectant circle. they, too, were silent, their eyes only gleaming and
their breaths drifting slowly upward. to buck it was nothing new or
strange, this scene of old time. it was as though it had always been,
the wonted way of things.

spitz was a practised fighter. from spitzbergen through the arctic, and
across canada and the barrens, he had held his own with all manner of
dogs and achieved to mastery over them. bitter rage was his, but never
blind rage. in passion to rend and destroy, he never forgot that his
enemy was in like passion to rend and destroy. he never rushed till
he was prepared to receive a r

defended that attack.

in vain buck strove to sink his teeth in the neck of the big white dog.
wherever his fangs struck for the softer flesh, they were countered by
the fangs of spitz. fang clashed fang, and lips were cut and bleeding,
but buck could not penetrate his enemy‚Äôs guard. then he warmed up and
enveloped spitz in a whirlwind of rushes. time and time again he tried
for the snow-white throat, where life bubbled near to the surface, and
each time and every time spitz slashed him and got away. then buck took
to rushing, as though for the throat, when, suddenly drawing back his
head and curving in from the side, he would drive his shoulder at the
shoulder of spitz, as a ram by which to overthrow him. but instead,
buck‚Äôs shoul

der was slashed down each time as spitz leaped lightly away.

spitz was untouched, while buck was streaming with blood and panting
hard. the fight was growing desperate. and all the while the silent and
wolfish circle waited to finish off whichever dog went down. as buck
grew winded, spitz took to rushing, and he kept him staggering for
footing. once buck went over, and the whole circle of sixty dogs started
up; but he recovered himself, almost in mid air, and the circle sank
down again and waited.

but buck possessed a quality that made for greatness--imagination. he
fought by instinct, but he could fight by head as well. he rushed, as
though attempting the old shoulder trick, but at the last instant swept
low to the snow and in. his teeth closed on spitz‚Äôs left fore leg. there
was a crunch of breaking bone, and the white dog faced him on thr

legs. thrice he tried to knock him over, then repeated the trick and
broke the right fore leg. despite the pain and helplessness, spitz
struggled madly to keep up. he saw the silent circle, with gleaming
eyes, lolling tongues, and silvery breaths drifting upward, closing in
upon him as he had seen similar circles close in upon beaten antagonists
in the past. only this time he was the one who was beaten.

there was no hope for him. buck was inexorable. mercy was a thing
reserved for gentler climes. he manoeuvred for the final rush. the
circle had tightened till he could feel the breaths of the huskies on
his flanks. he could see them, beyond spitz and to either side, half
crouching for the spring, their eyes fixed upon him. a pause seemed to
fall. every animal was motionless as though turned to stone. only spitz
quivered and bristled as he staggered back and forth, snarling with
horrible menace, as though to frighten off impen

ding death. then buck
sprang in and out; but while he was in, shoulder had at last squarely
met shoulder. the dark circle became a dot on the moon-flooded snow as
spitz disappeared from view. buck stood and looked on, the successful
champion, the dominant primordial beast who had made his kill and found
it good.

brought sol-leks to the coveted position. in his judgment, sol-leks was
the best lead-dog left. buck sprang upon sol-leks in a fury, driving him
back and standing in his place.

‚Äúeh? eh?‚Äù francois cried, slapping his thighs gleefully. ‚Äúlook at dat
buck. heem keel dat spitz, heem t‚Äôink to take de job.‚Äù

‚Äúgo ‚Äòway, chook!‚Äù he cried, but buck refused to budge.

he took buck by the scruff of the neck, and though the dog growled
threateningly, dragged him to one side and replaced sol-leks. the old
dog did not like it, and showed plainly that he was afraid of buck.
francois was obdurate, but when he turned his back buck again displaced
sol-leks, who was not at all unwilling to go.

francois was angry. ‚Äúnow, by gar, i feex you!‚Äù he cried, coming back
with a heavy club in his hand.

buck remembered the man in the red sweater, and retreated slowly; nor
did he attemp

t to charge in when sol-leks was once more brought
forward. but he circled just beyond the range of the club, snarling with
bitterness and rage; and while he circled he watched the club so as to
dodge it if thrown by francois, for he was become wise in the way of
clubs. the driver went about his work, and he called to buck when he was
ready to put him in his old place in front of dave. buck retreated two
or three steps. francois followed him up, whereupon he again retreated.
after some time of this, francois threw down the club, thinking that
buck feared a thrashing. but buck was in open revolt. he wanted, not to
escape a clubbing, but to have the leadership. it was his by right. he
had earned it, and he would not be content with less.

perrault took a hand. between them they ran him about for the better
part of an hour. they threw clubs at him. he dodged. they cursed him,

the camp, advertising plainly that when his desire was met, he would
come in and be good.

francois sat down and scratched his head. perrault looked at his watch
and swore. time was flying, and they should have been on the trail an
hour gone. francois scratched his head again. he shook it and grinned
sheepishly at the courier, who shrugged his shoulders in sign that they
were beaten. then francois went up to where sol-leks stood and called
to buck. buck laughed, as dogs laugh, yet kept his distance. francois
unfastened sol-leks‚Äôs traces and put him back in his old place. the team
stood harnessed to the sled in an unbroken line, ready for the trail.
there was no place for buck save at the front. once more francois
called, and once more buck laughed and kept away.

francois complied, whereupon buck trotted in, laughing triumphantly,
and swung around into position at the head of the team. h

fastened, the sled broken out, and with both men running they dashed out
on to the river trail.

highly as the dog-driver had forevalued buck, with his two devils, he
found, while the day was yet young, that he had undervalued. at a bound
buck took up the duties of leadership; and where judgment was required,
and quick thinking and quick acting, he showed himself the superior even
of spitz, of whom francois had never seen an equal.

but it was in giving the law and making his mates live up to it, that
buck excelled. dave and sol-leks did not mind the change in leadership.
it was none of their business. their business was to toil, and toil
mightily, in the traces. so long as that were not interfered with, they

ed. billee, the good-natured, could lead for all
they cared, so long as he kept order. the rest of the team, however, had
grown unruly during the last days of spitz, and their surprise was great
now that buck proceeded to lick them into shape.

pike, who pulled at buck‚Äôs heels, and who never put an ounce more of his
weight against the breast-band than he was compelled to do, was swiftly
and repeatedly shaken for loafing; and ere the first day was done he was
pulling more than ever before in his life. the first night in camp,
joe, the sour one, was punished roundly--a thing that spitz had never
succeeded in doing. buck simply smothered him by virtue of superior
weight, and cut him up till he ceased snapping and began to whine for
mercy.

the team picked up immediately. it recovered its
old-time solidarity, and once more the dogs leaped as one dog in the
traces. at the rink rapids two native huskies, teek and koona, were
added; and the celerity with which buck broke them in took away
francois‚Äôs breath.

‚Äúnevaire such a dog as dat buck!‚Äù he cried. ‚Äúno, nevaire! heem worth one
t‚Äôousan‚Äô dollair, by gar! eh? wot you say, perrault?‚Äù

and perrault nodded. he was ahead of the record then, and gaining day
by day. the trail was in excellent condition, well packed and hard, and
there was no new-fallen snow with which to contend. it was not too cold.
the temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there the whole
trip. the men rode and ran by turn, and the dogs were kept on the jump,
with but infrequent stoppages.

t was a record run. each day for fourteen days they had averaged forty
miles. for three days perrault and francois threw chests up and down the
main street of skaguay and were deluged with invitations to drink, while
the team was the constant centre of a worshipful crowd of dog-busters
and mushers. then three or four western bad men aspired to clean out
the town, were riddled like pepper-boxes for their pains, and public
interest turned to other idols. next came official orders. francois
called buck to him, threw his arms around him, wept over him. and that
was the last of francois and perrault. like other men, they passed out
of buck‚Äôs life for good.

a scotch half-breed took charge of him and his mates, and in company
with a dozen other dog-teams he started back over the weary trail to
dawson. it was no light running now, nor record time, but heavy toil
each day, with a heavy load behind; for this was the mail train,
carrying word from the world to the men who sought gold under the sha

buck did not like it, but he bore up well to the work, taking pride in
it after the manner of dave and sol-leks, and seeing that his mates,
whether they prided in it or not, did their fair share. it was a
monotonous life, operating with machine-like regularity. one day was
very like another. at a certain time each morning the cooks turned out,
fires were built, and breakfast was eaten. then, while some broke camp,
others harnessed the dogs, and they were under way an hour or so before

ell which gave warning of dawn. at night, camp was made.
some pitched the flies, others cut firewood and pine boughs for the
beds, and still others carried water or ice for the cooks. also, the
dogs were fed. to them, this was the one feature of the day, though it
was good to loaf around, after the fish was eaten, for an hour or so
with the other dogs, of which there were fivescore and odd. there were
fierce fighters among them, but three battles with the fiercest brought
buck to mastery, so that when he bristled and showed his teeth they got
out of his way.

best of all, perhaps, he loved to lie near the fire, hind legs crouched
under him, fore legs stretched out in front, head raised, and eyes
blinking dreamily at the flames. sometimes he thought of judge miller‚Äôs
big house in the sun-kissed santa clara valley, and of the cement
swimming-tank, and ysabel, the mexican hairless, and toots, the japanese
pug; but oftener he remembered the man in the red sweater, the

h trunk inclined forward from
the hips, on legs that bent at the knees. about his body there was
a peculiar springiness, or resiliency, almost catlike, and a quick
alertness as of one who lived in perpetual fear of things seen and
unseen.

at other times this hairy man squatted by the fire with head between
his legs and slept. on such occasions his elbows were on his knees, his
hands clasped above his head as though to shed rain by the hairy arms.
and beyond that fire, in the circling darkness, buck could see many
gleaming coals, two by two, always two by two, which he knew to be the
eyes of great beasts of prey. and he could hear the crashing of their
bodies through the undergrowth, and the noises they made in the night.
and dreaming there by the yukon bank, with lazy eyes blinking at the
fire, these sounds and sights of another world would make the hair to
rise along his back and stand on end across his shoulders and up his
neck, till he whimpered low and suppressedly, or growled softly,

 and the
half-breed cook shouted at him, ‚Äúhey, you buck, wake up!‚Äù whereupon the
other world would vanish and the real world come into his eyes, and he
would get up and yawn and stretch as though he had been asleep.

it was a hard trip, with the mail behind them, and the heavy work wore
them down. they were short of weight and in poor condition when they
made dawson, and should have had a ten days‚Äô or a week‚Äôs rest at
least. but in two days‚Äô time they dropped down the yukon bank from the
barracks, loaded with letters for the outside. the dog

best for the animals.

each night the dogs were attended to first. they ate before the drivers
ate, and no man sought his sleeping-robe till he had seen to the feet of
the dogs he drove. still, their strength went down. since the beginning
of the winter they had travelled eighteen hundred miles, dragging sleds
the whole weary distance; and eighteen hundred miles will tell upon life
of the toughest. buck stood it, keeping his mates up to their work and
maintaining discipline, though he, too, was very tired. billee cried and
whimpered regularly in his sleep each night. joe was sourer than ever,
and sol-leks was unapproachable, blind side or other side.

but it was dave who suffered most of all. something had gone wrong with
him. he became more morose and irritable, and when camp was pitched at
once made his nest, where his driver fed him. once out of the harness

inches. his strength left him, and the last his mates saw of him he lay
gasping in the snow and yearning toward them. but they could hear him
mournfully howling till they passed out of sight behind a belt of river
timber.

here the train was halted. the scotch half-breed slowly retraced his
steps to the camp they had left. the men ceased talking. a revolver-shot
rang out. the man came back hurriedly. the whips snapped, the bells
tinkled merrily, the sleds churned along the trail; but buck knew, and
every dog knew, what had taken place behind the belt of river trees.




chapter v. the toil of trace and trail


thirty days from the time it left dawson, the salt water mail, with buck
and his mates at the fore, arrived at skaguay. they were in a wretched
state, worn out and worn down. buck‚Äôs one hundred and forty pounds
had dwindled to one hundred and fifteen. the rest of his mates, though
lighter dogs, had relatively lost more weight than he. pike, the
malingerer, who, in his li

hey deserved an interval of loafing. but so
many were the men who had rushed into the klondike, and so many were the
sweethearts, wives, and kin that had not rushed in, that the congested
mail was taking on alpine proportions; also, there were official orders.
fresh batches of hudson bay dogs were to take the places of those
worthless for the trail. the worthless ones were to be got rid of, and,
since dogs count for little against dollars, they were to be sold.

three days passed, by which time buck and his mates found how really
tired and weak they were. then, on the morning of the fourth day, two
men from the states came along and bought them, harness and all, for a
song. the men addressed each other as ‚Äúhal‚Äù and ‚Äúcharles.‚Äù charles was
a middle-aged, lightish-colored man, with weak and watery eyes and a
mustache that twisted fiercely and vigorously up, giving the lie to the
limply drooping lip it concealed. hal was a youngster of nineteen or
twenty, with a big colt‚Äôs revolver a

nd a hunting-knife strapped about
him on a belt that fairly bristled with cartridges. this belt was the
most salient thing about him. it advertised his callowness--a callowness
sheer and unutterable. both men were manifestly out of place, and why
such as they should adventure the north is part of the mystery of things
that passes understanding.

buck heard the chaffering, saw the money pass between the man and the
government agent, and knew that the scotch half-breed and the mail-train
drivers were passing out of his life on the heels of perrault and
francois and the others who had gone before. when driven with his mates
to the new owners‚Äô camp, buck saw a slipshod and slovenly affair, tent
half stretched, dishes unwashed, everything in disorder; also, he saw a
woman. ‚Äúmercedes‚Äù the men called her. she was charles‚Äôs wife and hal‚Äôs

sister--a nice family party.

buck watched them apprehensively as they proceeded to take down the tent
and load the sled. there was a great deal of effort about their manner,
but no businesslike method. the tent was rolled into an awkward bundle
three times as large as it should have been. the tin dishes were packed
away unwashed. mercedes continually fluttered in the way of her men and
kept up an unbroken chattering of remonstrance and advice. when they put
a clothes-sack on the front of the sled, she suggested it should go on

brother. ‚Äúnever mind that man,‚Äù she said pointedly. ‚Äúyou‚Äôre driving
our dogs, and you do what you think best with them.‚Äù

again hal‚Äôs whip fell upon the dogs. they threw themselves against the
breast-bands, dug their feet into the packed snow, got down low to it,
and put forth all their strength. the sled held as though it were an
anchor. after two efforts, they stood still, panting. the whip was
whistling savagely, when once more mercedes interfered. she dropped on
her knees before buck, with tears in her eyes, and put her arms around
his neck.

‚Äúyou poor, poor dears,‚Äù she cried sympathetically, ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you pull
hard?--then you wouldn‚Äôt be whipped.‚Äù buck did not like her, but he
was feeling too miserable to resist her, taking it as part of the day‚Äôs
miserable work.

one of the onlookers, who had been clenching his teeth to suppress hot
speech, now spoke up:--

‚Äúit‚Äôs not that i care a whoop what becomes of you, but for the dogs‚Äô
sakes i just want to tell

against the gee-pole, right and left, and break it out.‚Äù

a third time the attempt was made, but this time, following the advice,
hal broke out the runners which had been frozen to the snow. the
overloaded and unwieldy sled forged ahead, buck and his mates struggling
frantically under the rain of blows. a hundred yards ahead the path
turned and sloped steeply into the main street. it would have required
an experienced man to keep the top-heavy sled upright, and hal was not
such a man. as they swung on the turn the sled went over, spilling
half its load through the loose lashings. the dogs never stopped. the
lightened sled bounded on its side behind them. they were angry because
of the ill treatment they had received and the unjust l

street, adding to the gayety of skaguay as they scattered the remainder
of the outfit along its chief thoroughfare.

le bulk. charles and hal went out in the evening and bought six
outside dogs. these, added to the six of the original team, and teek
and koona, the huskies obtained at the rink rapids on the record
trip, brought the team up to fourteen. but the outside dogs, though
practically broken in since their landing, did not amount to much. three
were short-haired pointers, one was a newfoundland, and the other
two were mongrels of indeterminate breed. they did not seem to know
anything, these newcomers. buck and his comrades looked upon them with
disgust, and though he speedily taught them their places and what not
to do, he could not teach them what to do. they did not take kindly
to trace and trail. with the exception of the two mongrels, they were
bewildered and spirit-broken by the strange savage environment in which
they found themselves and by the ill treatment they had received. the
two mongrels were without spirit at all; bones were the only things
breakable about them.

, or come in from
dawson, but never had they seen a sled with so many as fourteen dogs. in
the nature of arctic travel there was a reason why fourteen dogs should
not drag one sled, and that was that one sled could not carry the food
for fourteen dogs. but charles and hal did not know this. they had
worked the trip out with a pencil, so much to a dog, so many dogs,
so many days, q.e.d. mercedes looked over their shoulders and nodded
comprehensively, it was all so very simple.

late next morning buck led the long team up the street. there was
nothing lively about it, no snap or go in him and his fellows. they were
starting dead weary. four times he had covered the distance between salt
water and dawson, and the knowledge that, jaded and tired, he was facing
the same trail once more, made him bitter. his heart was not in
the work, nor was the heart of any dog. the outsides were timid and
frightened, the insides without confidence in their masters.

buck felt vaguely that there was no dependi

would commence. the outside dogs, whose digestions had not been trained
by chronic famine to make the most of little, had voracious appetites.
and when, in addition to this, the worn-out huskies pulled weakly, hal
decided that the orthodox ration was too small. he doubled it. and to
cap it all, when mercedes, with tears in her pretty eyes and a quaver
in her throat, could not cajole him into giving the dogs still more, she
stole from the fish-sacks and fed them slyly. but it was not food that
buck and the huskies needed, but rest. and though they were making poor
time, the heavy load they dragged sapped their strength severely.

then came the underfeeding. hal awoke one day to the fact that his
dog-food was half gone and the distance only quarter covered; further,
that for love or money no additional dog-food was to be obtained. so
he cut down even the orthodox ration and tried to increase the day‚Äôs
travel. his sister and brother-in-law seconded him; but they were
frustrated by their h

hours. not
only did they not know how to work dogs, but they did not know how to
work themselves.

the first to go was dub. poor blundering thief that he was, always
getting caught and punished, he had none the less been a faithful
worker. his wrenched shoulder-blade, untreated and unrested, went from
bad to worse, till finally hal shot him with the big colt‚Äôs revolver. it
is a saying of the country that an outside dog starves to death on the
ration of the husky, so the six outside dogs under buck could do no less
than die on half the ration of the husky. the newfoundland went first,
followed by the three short-haired pointers, the two mongrels hanging
more grittily on to life, but going in the end.

by this time all the amenities and gentlenesses of the southland had
fallen away from the three people. shorn of its glamour and romance,
arctic travel became to them a reality too harsh for their manhood and
womanhood. mercedes ceased weeping over the dogs, being too occupied
with weeping o

o trade them a few pounds of frozen horse-hide for the colt‚Äôs
revolver that kept the big hunting-knife company at hal‚Äôs hip. a poor
substitute for food was this hide, just as it had been stripped from the
starved horses of the cattlemen six months back. in its frozen state it
was more like strips of galvanized iron, and when a dog wrestled it into
his stomach it thawed into thin and innutritious leathery strings and
into a mass of short hair, irritating and indigestible.

and through it all buck staggered along at the head of the team as in
a nightmare. he pulled when he could; when he could no longer pull, he
fell down and remained down till blows from whip or club drove him
to his feet again. all the stiffness and gloss had gone out of his
beautiful furry coat. the hair hung down, limp and draggled, or matted
with dried blood where hal‚Äôs club had bruised him. his muscles had
wasted away to knotty strings, and the flesh pads had disappeared, so
that each rib and every bone in his fr

ame were outlined cleanly
through the loose hide that was wrinkled in folds of emptiness. it was
heartbreaking, only buck‚Äôs heart was unbreakable. the man in the red
sweater had proved that.

as it was with buck, so was it with his mates. they were perambulating
skeletons. there were seven all together, including him. in their very
great misery they had become insensible to the bite of the lash or the
bruise of the club. the pain of the beating was dull and distant,
just as the things their eyes saw and their ears heard seemed dull and
distant. they were not half living, or quarter living. they were simply
so many bags of bones in which sparks of life fluttered faintly. when a
halt was made, they dropp

ed down in the traces like dead dogs, and the
spark dimmed and paled and seemed to go out. and when the club or whip
fell upon them, the spark fluttered feebly up, and they tottered to
their feet and staggered on.

there came a day when billee, the good-natured, fell and could not rise.
hal had traded off his revolver, so he took the axe and knocked billee
on the head as he lay in the traces, then cut the carcass out of the
harness and dragged it to one side. buck saw, and his mates saw, and
they knew that this thing was very close to them. on the next day koona
went, and but five of them remained: joe, too far gone to be malignant;
pike, crippled and limping, only half conscious and not conscious enough
longer to malinger; sol-leks, the one-eyed, still faithful to the toil
of trace and trail, and mournful in that he had so little strength with
which to pull; teek, who had not travelled so far that winter and who
was now beaten more than the others becau

se he was fresher; and buck,
still at the head of the team, but no longer enforcing discipline or
striving to enforce it, blind with weakness half the time and keeping
the trail by the loom of it and by the dim feel of his feet.

it was beautiful spring weather, but neither dogs nor humans were aware
of it. each day the sun rose earlier and set later. it was dawn by three
in the morning, and twilight lingered till nine at night. the whole long
day was a blaze of sunshine. the ghostly winter silence had given way

‚Äúand they told you true,‚Äù john thornton answered. ‚Äúthe bottom‚Äôs likely

could have made it. i tell you straight, i wouldn‚Äôt risk my carcass on

‚Äúthat‚Äôs because you‚Äôre not a fool, i suppose,‚Äù said hal. ‚Äúall the same,
we‚Äôll go on to dawson.‚Äù he uncoiled his whip. ‚Äúget up there, buck! hi!
get up there! mush on!‚Äù

thornton went on whittling. it was idle, he knew, to get between a fool
and his folly; while two or three fools more or less would not alter the
scheme of things.

but the team did not get up at the command. it had long since passed
into the stage where blows were required to rouse it. the whip flashed
out, here and there, on its merciless errands. john thornton compressed
his lips. sol-leks was the first to crawl to his feet. teek followed.
joe came next, yelpin

g with pain. pike made painful efforts. twice he
fell over, when half up, and on the third attempt managed to rise. buck
made no effort. he lay quietly where he had fallen. the lash bit into
him again and again, but he neither whined nor struggled. several times
thornton started, as though to speak, but changed his mind. a moisture
came into his eyes, and, as the whipping continued, he arose and walked
irresolutely up and down.

this was the first time buck had failed, in itself a sufficient reason
to drive hal into a rage. he exchanged the whip for the customary club.
buck refused to move under the rain of heavier blows which now fell upon
him. like his mates, he was barely able to get up, but, unlike them, he
had made up his mind not to get up. he had a vague feeling of impending
doom. this had been strong upon him when he pulled in to the bank, and
it had not departed from him. what of the thin and rotten ice he had
felt under his feet all day,

ng, though very faintly he could hear the impact of
the club upon his body. but it was no longer his body, it seemed so far
away.

and then, suddenly, without warning, uttering a cry that was
inarticulate and more like the cry of an animal, john thornton sprang
upon the man who wielded the club. hal was hurled backward, as
though struck by a falling tree. mercedes screamed. charles looked on
wistfully, wiped his watery eyes, but did not get up because of his
stiffness.

john thornton stood over buck, struggling to control himself, too
convulsed with rage to speak.

‚Äúif you strike that dog again, i‚Äôll kill you,‚Äù he at last managed to say
in a choking voice.

‚Äúit‚Äôs my dog,‚Äù hal replied, wiping the blood from his mouth as he came
back. ‚Äúget out of my way, or i‚Äôll fix you. i‚Äôm going to dawson.‚Äù

thornton stood between him and buck, and evinced no intention of getting
out of the way. hal drew his long hunting-knife. mercedes screamed,
cried, laughed, and manifested the chaot

ic abandonment of hysteria.
thornton rapped hal‚Äôs knuckles with the axe-handle, knocking the knife
to the ground. he rapped his knuckles again as he tried to pick it up.
then he stooped, picked it up himself, and with two strokes cut buck‚Äôs
traces.

hal had no fight left in him. besides, his hands were full with his
sister, or his arms, rather; while buck was too near dead to be of
further use in hauling the sled. a few minutes later they pulled out
from the bank and down the river. buck heard them go and raised his head
to see, pike was leading, sol-leks was at the wheel, and between were
joe and teek. they were limping and staggering. mercedes was riding the
loaded sled. hal guided at the gee-pole, and charles stumbled along in
the rear.

as buck watched them, thornton knelt beside him and with rough, kindly
hands searched for broken bones. by the time his search had disclosed
nothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation, the
sled was a quarter of a mile

away. dog and man watched it crawling along
over the ice. suddenly, they saw its back end drop down, as into a rut,
and the gee-pole, with hal clinging to it, jerk into the air. mercedes‚Äôs
scream came to their ears. they saw charles turn and make one step to
run back, and then a whole section of ice give way and dogs and humans
disappear. a yawning hole was all that was to be seen. the bottom had
dropped out of the trail.

john thornton and buck looked at each other.

‚Äúyou poor devil,‚Äù said john thornton, and buck licked his hand.




chapter vi. for the love of a man


when john thornton froze his feet in the previous december his partners
had made him comfortable and left him to get well, going on themselves
up the river to get out a raft of saw-logs for dawson. he was still
limping slightly at the time he rescued buck, but with the continued
warm weather even the slight limp left him. and here, lying by the river
bank through th
 
 ___________________________
 
e long spring days, watching the running water, listening
lazily to the songs of birds and the hum of nature, buck slowly won back
his strength.

a rest comes very good after one has travelled three thousand miles,
and it must be confessed that buck waxed lazy as his wounds healed, his
muscles swelled out, and the flesh came back to cover his bones. for
that matter, they were all loafing,--buck, john thornton, and skeet
and nig,--waiting for the raft to come that was to carry them down to
dawson. skeet was a little irish setter who early made friends with
buck, who, in a dying condition, was unable to resent her first
advances. she had the doctor trait which some dogs possess; and as a
mother cat washes her kittens, so she washed and cleansed buck‚Äôs
wounds. regularly, each morning after he had finished his breakfast,
she performed her self-appointed task, till he came to look for he

r
ministrations as much as he did for thornton‚Äôs. nig, equally friendly,
though less demonstrative, was a huge black dog, half bloodhound and
half deerhound, with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature.

to buck‚Äôs surprise these dogs manifested no jealousy toward him. they
seemed to share the kindliness and largeness of john thornton. as buck
grew stronger they enticed him into all sorts of ridiculous games, in
which thornton himself could not forbear to join; and in this fashion
buck romped through his convalescence and into a new existence. love,
genuine passionate love, was his for the first time. this he had never
experienced at judge miller‚Äôs down in the sun-kissed santa clara valley.
with the judge‚Äôs sons, hunting and tramping, it had been a working
partnership; with the judge‚Äôs grandsons, a sort of pompous guardianship;
and with the judge himself, a stately and dignified friendship. but love
that was feverish and burning, that was adoration, that was madness, it

this man had saved his life, which was something; but, further, he was
the ideal master. other men saw to the welfare of their dogs from a
sense of duty and business expediency; he saw to the welfare of his as
if they were his own children, because he could not help it. and he saw
further. he never forgot a kindly greeting or a cheering word, and to
sit down for a long talk with them (‚Äúgas‚Äù he called it) was as much his
delight as theirs. he had a way of taking buck‚Äôs head roughly between
his hands, and resting his own head upon buck‚Äôs, of shaking him back
and forth, the while calling him ill names that to buck were love
names. buck knew no greater joy than that rough embrace and the sound of
murmured oaths, and at each jerk back and forth it seemed that his heart
would be shaken out of his body so great was its ecstasy. and when,
released, he sprang to his feet, his mouth laughing, his eyes eloquent,
his throat vibrant with unuttered sound, and in tha

t fashion remained
without movement, john thornton would reverently exclaim, ‚Äúgod! you can
all but speak!‚Äù

buck had a trick of love expression that was akin to hurt. he would
often seize thornton‚Äôs hand in his mouth and close so fiercely that the
flesh bore the impress of his teeth for some time afterward. and as
buck understood the oaths to be love words, so the man understood this
feigned bite for a caress.

for the most part, however, buck‚Äôs love was expressed in adoration.
while he went wild with happiness when thornton touched him or spoke to
him, he did not seek these tokens. unlike skeet, who was wont to shove
her nose under thornton‚Äôs hand and nudge and nudge till petted, or nig,
who would stalk up and rest his great head on thornton‚Äôs knee, buck was
content to adore at a distance. he would lie by the hour, eager, alert,
at thornton‚Äôs feet, looking up into his face, dwelling upon it, studying
it, following with keene

st interest each fleeting expression, every
movement or change of feature. or, as chance might have it, he would lie
farther away, to the side or rear, watching the outlines of the man and
the occasional movements of his body. and often, such was the communion
in which they lived, the strength of buck‚Äôs gaze would draw john
thornton‚Äôs head around, and he would return the gaze, without speech,
his heart shining out of his eyes as buck‚Äôs heart shone out.

for a long time after his rescue, buck did not like thornton to get out
of his sight. from the moment he left the tent to when he entered it
again, buck would follow at his heels. his transient masters since he
had come into the northland had bred in him a fear that no master could
be permanent. he was afraid that thornton would pass out of his life as
perrault and francois and the scotch half-breed had passed out. even in
the night, in his dreams, he was haunted by this fear. at such times
he would shake off sleep and creep through

ion. because of his very great love, he could not steal from
this man, but from any other man, in any other camp, he did not hesitate
an instant; while the cunning with which he stole enabled him to escape
detection.

his face and body were scored by the teeth of many dogs, and he
fought as fiercely as ever and more shrewdly. skeet and nig were too
good-natured for quarrelling,--besides, they belonged to john thornton;
but the strange dog, no matter what the breed or valor, swiftly
acknowledged buck‚Äôs supremacy or found himself struggling for life with
a terrible antagonist. and buck was merciless. he had learned well the
law of club and fang, and he never forewent an advantage or drew back
from a foe he had started on the way to death. he had lessoned from
spitz, and from the chief fighting dogs of the police and mail, and knew
there was no middle course. he must master or be mastered; while to show
mercy was a weakness. mercy did not exist in the primordial life. it was

 or why; nor did he wonder where or why, the
call sounding imperiously, deep in the forest. but as often as he gained
the soft unbroken earth and the green shade, the love for john thornton
drew him back to the fire again.

thornton alone held him. the rest of mankind was as nothing. chance
travellers might praise or pet him; but he was cold under it all,
and from a too demonstrative man he would get up and walk away. when
thornton‚Äôs partners, hans and pete, arrived on the long-expected raft,
buck refused to notice them till he learned they were close to thornton;
after that he tolerated them in a passive sort of way, accepting favors
from them as though he favored them by accepting. they were of the same
large type as thornton, living close to the earth, thinking simply and
seeing clearly; and ere they swung the raft into the big eddy by the
saw-mill at dawson, they understood buck and his ways, and did not
insist upon an intimacy such as obtained with skeet and nig.

ver, his love seemed to grow and grow. he, alone among
men, could put a pack upon buck‚Äôs back in the summer travelling. nothing
was too great for buck to do, when thornton commanded. one day (they had
grub-staked themselves from the proceeds of the raft and left dawson
for the head-waters of the tanana) the men and dogs were sitting on the
crest of a cliff which fell away, straight down, to naked bed-rock three
hundred feet below. john thornton was sitting near the edge, buck at his
shoulder. a thoughtless whim seized thornton, and he drew the attention
of hans and pete to the experiment he had in mind. ‚Äújump, buck!‚Äù he
commanded, sweeping his arm out and over the chasm. the next instant he
was grappling with buck on the extreme edge, while hans and pete were
dragging them back into safety.

‚Äúit‚Äôs uncanny,‚Äù pete said, after it was over and they had caught their
speech.

thornton shook his head. ‚Äúno, it is splendid, and it is terrible, too.

‚Äúi‚Äôm not hankering to be the man that lays hands on you while he‚Äôs

‚Äúpy jingo!‚Äù was hans‚Äôs contribution. ‚Äúnot mineself either.‚Äù

it was at circle city, ere the year was out, that pete‚Äôs apprehensions
were realized. ‚Äúblack‚Äù burton, a man evil-tempered and malicious, had
been picking a quarrel with a tenderfoot at the bar, when thornton
stepped good-naturedly between. buck, as was his custom, was lying in a
corner, head on paws, watching his master‚Äôs every action. burton struck
out, without warning, straight from the shoulder. thornton was sent
spinning, and saved himself from falling only by clutching the rail of
the bar.

those who were looking on heard what was neither bark nor yelp, but a
something which is best described as a roar, and they saw buck‚Äôs body
rise up in the air as he left the floor for burton‚Äôs throat. the man

ely throwing out his arm, but was hurled
backward to the floor with buck on top of him. buck loosed his teeth
from the flesh of the arm and drove in again for the throat. this time
the man succeeded only in partly blocking, and his throat was torn open.
then the crowd was upon buck, and he was driven off; but while a surgeon
checked the bleeding, he prowled up and down, growling furiously,
attempting to rush in, and being forced back by an array of hostile
clubs. a ‚Äúminers‚Äô meeting,‚Äù called on the spot, decided that the dog had
sufficient provocation, and buck was discharged. but his reputation was
made, and from that day his name spread through every camp in alaska.

later on, in the fall of the year, he saved john thornton‚Äôs life in
quite another fashion. the th

ree partners were lining a long and narrow
poling-boat down a bad stretch of rapids on the forty-mile creek. hans
and pete moved along the bank, snubbing with a thin manila rope from
tree to tree, while thornton remained in the boat, helping its descent
by means of a pole, and shouting directions to the shore. buck, on the
bank, worried and anxious, kept abreast of the boat, his eyes never off
his master.

at a particularly bad spot, where a ledge of barely submerged rocks
jutted out into the river, hans cast off the rope, and, while thornton
poled the boat out into the stream, ran down the bank with the end in
his hand to snub the boat when it had cleared the ledge. this it did,
and was flying down-stream in a current as swift as a mill-race, when
hans checked it with the rope and checked too suddenly. t

over and snubbed in to the bank bottom up, while thornton, flung sheer
out of it, was carried down-stream toward the worst part of the rapids,
a stretch of wild water in which no swimmer could live.

buck had sprung in on the instant; and at the end of three hundred
yards, amid a mad swirl of water, he overhauled thornton. when he felt
him grasp his tail, buck headed for the bank, swimming with all his
splendid strength. but the progress shoreward was slow; the progress
down-stream amazingly rapid. from below came the fatal roaring where the
wild current went wilder and was rent in shreds and spray by the rocks
which thrust through like the teeth of an enormous comb. the suck of the
water as it took the beginning of the last steep pitch was frightful,
and thornton knew that the shore was impossible. he scraped furiously
over a rock, bruised across a

force. he clutched its slippery top with both hands, releasing buck, and
above the roar of the churning water shouted: ‚Äúgo, buck! go!‚Äù

buck could not hold his own, and swept on down-stream, struggling
desperately, but unable to win back. when he heard thornton‚Äôs command
repeated, he partly reared out of the water, throwing his head high, as
though for a last look, then turned obediently toward the bank. he swam
powerfully and was dragged ashore by pete and hans at the very point
where swimming ceased to be possible and destruction began.

they could up the bank to a point far above where thornton was hanging
on. they attached the line with which they had been snubbing the boat to
buck‚Äôs neck and shoulders, being careful that it should neither strangle
him nor impede his swimming, and launched him into the stream. he struck
out boldly, but not straight enough into the stream. he discovered the
mistake too late, when thornton was abreast of him and a bare half-dozen
strokes away while he was being carried helplessly past.

hans promptly snubbed with the rope, as though buck were a boat. the

struck against the bank and he was hauled out. he was half drowned, and
hans and pete threw themselves upon him, pounding the breath into him
and the water out of him. he staggered to his feet and fell down. the
faint sound of thornton‚Äôs voice came to them, and though they could not
make out the words of it, they knew that he was in his extremity. his
master‚Äôs voice acted on buck like an electric shock, he sprang to his
feet and ran up the bank ahead of the men to the point of his previous
departure.

again the rope was attached and he was launched, and again he struck
out, but this time straight into the stream. he had miscalculated once,
but he would not be guilty of it a second time. hans paid out the rope,
permitting no slack, while pete kept it clear of coils. buck held on
till he was on a line straight above thornton; then he turned, and with
the speed of an expre

coming, and, as buck struck him like a battering ram, with the whole
force of the current behind him, he reached up and closed with both arms
around the shaggy neck. hans snubbed the rope around the tree, and
buck and thornton were jerked under the water. strangling, suffocating,
sometimes one uppermost and sometimes the other, dragging over the
jagged bottom, smashing against rocks and snags, they veered in to the
bank.

thornton came to, belly downward and being violently propelled back
and forth across a drift log by hans and pete. his first glance was for
buck, over whose limp and apparently lifeless body nig was setting up a
howl, while skeet was licking the wet face and closed eyes. thornton was

when he had been brought around, finding three broken ribs.

‚Äúthat settles it,‚Äù he announced. ‚Äúwe camp right here.‚Äù and camp they
did, till buck‚Äôs ribs knitted and he was able to travel.

that winter, at dawson, buck performed another exploit, not so heroic,
perhaps, but one that put his name many notches higher on the totem-pole
of alaskan fame. this exploit was particularly gratifying to the three
men; for they stood in need of the outfit which it furnished, and were
enabled to make a long-desired trip into the virgin east, where miners
had not yet appeared. it was brought about by a conversation in the
eldorado saloon, in which men waxed boastful of their favorite dogs.

was driven stoutly to defend him. at the end of half an hour one man
stated that his dog could start a sled with five hundred pounds and
walk off with it; a second bragged six hundred for his dog; and a third,
seven hundred.

‚Äúpooh! pooh!‚Äù said john thornton; ‚Äúbuck can start a thousand pounds.‚Äù

‚Äúand break it out? and walk off with it for a hundred yards?‚Äù demanded
matthewson, a bonanza king, he of the seven hundred vaunt.

‚Äúand break it out, and walk off with it for a hundred yards,‚Äù john
thornton said coolly.

‚Äúwell,‚Äù matthewson said, slowly and deliberately, so that all could

is.‚Äù so saying, he slammed a sack of gold dust of the size of a bologna

half a ton! the enormousness of it appalled him. he had great faith in
buck‚Äôs strength and had often thought him capable of starting such a
load; but never, as now, had he faced the possibility of it, the eyes
of a dozen men fixed upon him, silent and waiting. further, he had no
thousand dollars; nor had hans or pete.

mptied its occupants into the street to see the test. the
tables were deserted, and the dealers and gamekeepers came forth to see
the outcome of the wager and to lay odds. several hundred men, furred
and mittened, banked around the sled within easy distance. matthewson‚Äôs
sled, loaded with a thousand pounds of flour, had been standing for a
couple of hours, and in the intense cold (it was sixty below zero) the
runners had frozen fast to the hard-packed snow. men offered odds of two
to one that buck could not budge the sled. a quibble arose concerning
the phrase ‚Äúbreak out.‚Äù o‚Äôbrien contended it was thornton‚Äôs privilege
to knock the runners loose, leaving buck to ‚Äúbreak it out‚Äù from a dead
standstill. matthewson insisted that the phrase included breaking the
runners from the frozen grip of the snow. a majority of the men who had
witnessed the making of the bet decided in his favor, whereat the odds
went up to three to one against buck.

there were no takers. not a man believed

ubt was strong in his face, but his fighting spirit was
aroused--the fighting spirit that soars above odds, fails to recognize
the impossible, and is deaf to all save the clamor for battle. he called
hans and pete to him. their sacks were slim, and with his own the three
partners could rake together only two hundred dollars. in the ebb of
their fortunes, this sum was their total capital; yet they laid it
unhesitatingly against matthewson‚Äôs six hundred.

the team of ten dogs was unhitched, and buck, with his own harness, was
put into the sled. he had caught the contagion of the excitement, and
he felt that in some way he must do a great thing for john thornton.
murmurs of admiration at his splendid appearance went up. he was in
perfect condition, without an ounce of superfluous flesh, and the one
hundred and fifty pounds that he weighed were so many pounds of grit and
virility. his furry coat shone with the sheen of silk. down the neck and
across the shoulders, his mane, in repose as it w

ctive. the great breast and heavy fore legs
were no more than in proportion with the rest of the body, where the
muscles showed in tight rolls underneath the skin. men felt these
muscles and proclaimed them hard as iron, and the odds went down to two
to one.

‚Äúgad, sir! gad, sir!‚Äù stuttered a member of the latest dynasty, a king
of the skookum benches. ‚Äúi offer you eight hundred for him, sir, before
the test, sir; eight hundred just as he stands.‚Äù

thornton shook his head and stepped to buck‚Äôs side.

‚Äúyou must stand off from him,‚Äù matthewson protested. ‚Äúfree play and
plenty of room.‚Äù

the crowd fell silent; only could be heard the voices of the gamblers
vainly offering two to one. everybody acknowledged buck a magnificent
animal, but twenty fifty-pound sacks of flour bulked too large in their
eyes for them to loosen their pouch-strings.

thornton knelt down by buck‚Äôs side. he took his head in his two hands
and rested cheek on cheek. he did not playfully shake him, as wa

wont, or murmur soft love curses; but he whispered in his ear. ‚Äúas you
love me, buck. as you love me,‚Äù was what he whispered. buck whined with
suppressed eagerness.

the crowd was watching curiously. the affair was growing mysterious. it
seemed like a conjuration. as thornton got to his feet, buck seized his
mittened hand between his jaws, pressing in with his teeth and releasing
slowly, half-reluctantly. it was the answer, in terms, not of speech,
but of love. thornton stepped well back.

‚Äúnow, buck,‚Äù he said.

buck tightened the traces, then slacked them for a matter of several
inches. it was the way he had learned.

‚Äúgee!‚Äù thornton‚Äôs voice rang out, sharp in the tense silence.

buck swung to the right, ending the movement in a plunge that took up
the slack and with a sudden

jerk arrested his one hundred and fifty
pounds. the load quivered, and from under the runners arose a crisp
crackling.

‚Äúhaw!‚Äù thornton commanded.

buck duplicated the manoeuvre, this time to the left. the crackling
turned into a snapping, the sled pivoting and the runners slipping and
grating several inches to the side. the sled was broken out. men were
holding their breaths, intensely unconscious of the fact.

‚Äúnow, mush!‚Äù

thornton‚Äôs command cracked out like a pistol-shot. buck threw himself
forward, tightening the traces with a jarring lunge. his whole body
was gathered compactly together in the tremendous effort, the muscles
writhing and knotting like live things under the silky fur. his great
chest was low to the ground, his head forward and down, while his
feet were flying like mad, the claws scarring the hard-packed snow in
parallel grooves. the sled swayed and trembled, half-started forward.
one of his feet slipped, and one man groaned aloud. then the sled

ed ahead in what appeared a rapid succession of jerks, though it
never really came to a dead stop again...half an inch...an inch... two
inches... the jerks perceptibly diminished; as the sled gained momentum,
he caught them up, till it was moving steadily along.

men gasped and began to breathe again, unaware that for a moment they
had ceased to breathe. thornton was running behind, encouraging buck
with short, cheery words. the distance had been measured off, and as he
neared the pile of firewood which marked the end of the hundred yards,
a cheer began to grow and grow, which burst into a roar as he passed
the firewood and halted at command. every man was tearing himself loose,
even matthewson. hats and mittens were flying in the air. men were
shaking hands, it did not matter with whom, and bubbling over in a
general incoherent babel.

but thornton fell on his knees beside buck. head was

and he was shaking him back and forth. those who hurried up heard him
cursing buck, and he cursed him long and fervently, and softly and
lovingly.

a thousand for him, sir, a thousand, sir--twelve hundred, sir.‚Äù

thornton rose to his feet. his eyes were wet. the tears were streaming
frankly down his cheeks. ‚Äúsir,‚Äù he said to the skookum bench king, ‚Äúno,
sir. you can go to hell, sir. it‚Äôs the best i can do for you, sir.‚Äù

forth. as though animated by a common impulse, the onlookers drew back
to a respectful distance; nor were they again indiscreet enough to
interrupt.




chapter vii. the sounding of the call


when buck earned sixteen hundred dollars in five minutes for john
thornton, he made it possible for his master to pay off certain debts
and to journey with his partners into the east after a fabled lost mine,
the history of which was as old as the history of the country. many men
had sought it; few had found it; and more than a few there were who had
never returned from the quest. this lost mine was steeped in tragedy and
shrouded in mystery. no one knew of the first man. the oldest tradition
stopped bef

ore it got back to him. from the beginning there had been an
ancient and ramshackle cabin. dying men had sworn to it, and to the mine
the site of which it marked, clinching their testimony with nuggets that
were unlike any known grade of gold in the northland.

but no living man had looted this treasure house, and the dead were
dead; wherefore john thornton and pete and hans, with buck and half a
dozen other dogs, faced into the east on an unknown trail to achieve
where men and dogs as good as themselves had failed. they sledded
seventy miles up the yukon, swung to the left into the stewart river,
passed the mayo and the mcquestion, and held on until the stewart itself
became a streamlet, threading the upstanding peaks which marked the
backbone of the continent.

john thornton asked little of man or nature. he was unafraid of the
wild. with a handful of salt and a rifle he co

wilderness and fare wherever he pleased and as long as he pleased. being
in no haste, indian fashion, he hunted his dinner in the course of the
day‚Äôs travel; and if he failed to find it, like the indian, he kept on
travelling, secure in the knowledge that sooner or later he would come
to it. so, on this great journey into the east, straight meat was the
bill of fare, ammunition and tools principally made up the load on the
sled, and the time-card was drawn upon the limitless future.

to buck it was boundless delight, this hunting, fishing, and indefinite
wandering through strange places. for weeks at a time they would hold
on steadily, day after day; and for weeks upon end they would camp, here
and there, the dogs loafing and the men burning holes through frozen
muck and gravel and washing countless pans of dirt by the heat of the
fire. sometimes they went hungry, sometimes they feasted riotously, all
according to the abundance of game and the fortune of hunting. summer

they sought no farther. each day they worked earned them thousands of
dollars in clean dust and nuggets, and they worked every day. the gold
was sacked in moose-hide bags, fifty pounds to the bag, and piled
like so much firewood outside the spruce-bough lodge. like giants they
toiled, days flashing on the heels of days like dreams as they heaped
the treasure up.

there was nothing for the dogs to do, save the hauling in of meat now
and again that thornton killed, and buck spent long hours musing by
the fire. the vision of the short-legged hairy man came to him more
frequently, now that there was little work to be done; and often,
blinking by the fire, buck wandered with him in that other world which
he remembered.

the salient thing of this other world seemed fear. when he watched the
hairy man sleeping by the fire, head between his knees and hands
clasped above, buck saw that he slept restlessly, with many starts and
awakenings, at which times he would peer fea

rfully into the darkness
and fling more wood upon the fire. did they walk by the beach of a sea,
where the hairy man gathered shellfish and ate them as he gathered,
it was with eyes that roved everywhere for hidden danger and with legs
prepared to run like the wind at its first appearance. through the
forest they crept noiselessly, buck at the hairy man‚Äôs heels; and they
were alert and vigilant, the pair of them, ears twitching and moving and
nostrils quivering, for the man heard and smelled as keenly as buck. the
hairy man could spring up into the trees and travel ahead as fast as on
the ground, swinging by the arms from limb to limb, sometimes a dozen
feet apart, letting go and catching, never falling, never missing his
grip. in fact, he seemed as much at home among the trees as on the
ground; and buck had memories of nigh

unlike, any noise made by husky dog. and he knew it, in the old familiar
way, as a sound heard before. he sprang through the sleeping camp and in
swift silence dashed through the woods. as he drew closer to the cry
he went more slowly, with caution in every movement, till he came to an
open place among the trees, and looking out saw, erect on haunches, with
nose pointed to the sky, a long, lean, timber wolf.

he had made no noise, yet it ceased from its howling and tried to sense
his presence. buck stalked into the open, half crouching, body gathered
compactly together, tail straight and stiff, feet falling with unwonted
care. every movement advertised commingled threatening and overture of
friendliness. it was the menacing truce that marks the meeting of wild
beasts that prey. but the wolf fled at sight of him. he followed, with
wild leapings, in a frenzy to overtake. he ran him into a blind channel,
in the bed of the creek where a timber jam barred the way. the wolf
whirled about, pivot

ing on his hind legs after the fashion of joe and
of all cornered husky dogs, snarling and bristling, clipping his teeth
together in a continuous and rapid succession of snaps.

buck did not attack, but circled him about and hedged him in with
friendly advances. the wolf was suspicious and afraid; for buck made
three of him in weight, while his head barely reached buck‚Äôs shoulder.
watching his chance, he darted away, and the chase was resumed. time
and again he was cornered, and the thing repeated, though he was in poor
condition, or buck could not so easily have overtaken him. he would run
till buck‚Äôs head was even with his flank, when he would whirl around at
bay, only to dash away again at the first opportunity.

but in the end buck‚Äôs pertinacity was rewarded; for the wolf, finding
that no harm was intended, finally sniffed noses with him. then they

became friendly, and played about in the nervous, half-coy way with
which fierce beasts belie their fierceness. after some time of this the
wolf started off at an easy lope in a manner that plainly showed he was
going somewhere. he made it clear to buck that he was to come, and they
ran side by side through the sombre twilight, straight up the creek bed,
into the gorge from which it issued, and across the bleak divide where
it took its rise.

on the opposite slope of the watershed they came down into a level
country where were great stretches of forest and many streams, and
through these great stretches they ran steadily, hour after hour, the
sun rising higher and the day growing warmer. buck was wildly glad. he
knew he was at last answering t

he call, running by the side of his wood
brother toward the place from where the call surely came. old memories
were coming upon him fast, and he was stirring to them as of old he
stirred to the realities of which they were the shadows. he had done
this thing before, somewhere in that other and dimly remembered world,
and he was doing it again, now, running free in the open, the unpacked
earth underfoot, the wide sky overhead.

they stopped by a running stream to drink, and, stopping, buck
remembered john thornton. he sat down. the wolf started on toward the
place from where the call surely came, then returned to him, sniffing
noses and making actions as though to encourage him. but buck turned
about and started slowly on the back track. for the better part of an
hour the wild brother ran by his side, whining softly. then he sat down,
pointed his nose upward, and howled. it was a mournful howl, and as buck
held steadily on his way he heard it grow faint and fainter until it was

ost in the distance.

john thornton was eating dinner when buck dashed into camp and sprang
upon him in a frenzy of affection, overturning him, scrambling upon him,
licking his face, biting his hand--‚Äúplaying the general tom-fool,‚Äù as
john thornton characterized it, the while he shook buck back and forth
and cursed him lovingly.

for two days and nights buck never left camp, never let thornton out of
his sight. he followed him about at his work, watched him while he ate,
saw him into his blankets at night and out of them in the morning. but
after two days the call in the forest began to sound more imperiously
than ever. buck‚Äôs restlessness came back on him, and he was haunted by
recollections of the wild brother, and of the smiling land beyond the
divide and the run side by side through the wide forest stretches. once
again he took to wandering i

imber and streams. there he wandered for a week,
seeking vainly for fresh sign of the wild brother, killing his meat as
he travelled and travelling with the long, easy lope that seems never to
tire. he fished for salmon in a broad stream that emptied somewhere into
the sea, and by this stream he killed a large black bear, blinded by
the mosquitoes while likewise fishing, and raging through the forest
helpless and terrible. even so, it was a hard fight, and it aroused the
last latent remnants of buck‚Äôs ferocity. and two days later, when he
returned to his kill and found a dozen wolverenes quarrelling over the
spoil, he scattered them like chaff; and those that fled left two behind
who would quarrel no more.

the blood-longing became stronger than ever before. he was a killer, a
thing that preyed, living on the things that lived, unaided, alone,
by virtue of his own strength and prowess, surviving triumphantly in a
hostile environment where only the strong survived. because of all this

rceiving, determining, and
responding were sequential; but so infinitesimal were the intervals
of time between them that they appeared simultaneous. his muscles were
surcharged with vitality, and snapped into play sharply, like steel
springs. life streamed through him in splendid flood, glad and rampant,
until it seemed that it would burst him asunder in sheer ecstasy and
pour forth generously over the world.

‚Äúnever was there such a dog,‚Äù said john thornton one day, as the
partners watched buck marching out of camp.

‚Äúwhen he was made, the mould was broke,‚Äù said pete.

‚Äúpy jingo! i t‚Äôink so mineself,‚Äù hans affirmed.

they saw him marching out of camp, but they did not see the instant and
terrible transformation which took place as soon as he was within the
secrecy of the forest. he no longer marched. at once he became a thing
of the wild, stealing along softly, cat-footed, a passing shadow
that appeared and disappeared among the shadows. he knew how to take
advantage of ever

 were not too quick
for him; nor were beaver, mending their dams, too wary. he killed
to eat, not from wantonness; but he preferred to eat what he killed
himself. so a lurking humor ran through his deeds, and it was his
delight to steal upon the squirrels, and, when he all but had them, to
let them go, chattering in mortal fear to the treetops.

as the fall of the year came on, the moose appeared in greater
abundance, moving slowly down to meet the winter in the lower and less
rigorous valleys. buck had already dragged down a stray part-grown calf;
but he wished strongly for larger and more formidable quarry, and he
came upon it one day on the divide at the head of the creek. a band of
twenty moose had crossed over from the land of streams and timber,
and chief among them was a great bull. he was in a savage temper, and,
standing over six feet from the ground, was as formidable an antagonist
as even buck could desire. back and forth the bull tossed his great
palmated antlers, branching to

fourteen points and embracing seven feet
within the tips. his small eyes burned with a vicious and bitter light,
while he roared with fury at sight of buck.

from the bull‚Äôs side, just forward of the flank, protruded a feathered
arrow-end, which accounted for his savageness. guided by that instinct
which came from the old hunting days of the primordial world, buck
proceeded to cut the bull out from the herd. it was no slight task. he
would bark and dance about in front of the bull, just out of reach
of the great antlers and of the terrible splay hoofs which could have
stamped his life out with a single blow. unable to turn his back on
the fanged danger and go on, the bull would be driven into paroxysms of
rage. at such moments he charged buck, who retreated craftily, luring
him on by a simulated inability to escape. but when he was thus
separated from hi

s fellows, two or three of the younger bulls would
charge back upon buck and enable the wounded bull to rejoin the herd.

there is a patience of the wild--dogged, tireless, persistent as life
itself--that holds motionless for endless hours the spider in its web,
the snake in its coils, the panther in its ambuscade; this patience
belongs peculiarly to life when it hunts its living food; and it
belonged to buck as he clung to the flank of the herd, retarding
its march, irritating the young bulls, worrying the cows with their
half-grown calves, and driving the wounded bull mad with helpless rage.
for half a day this continued. buck multiplied himself, attacking from
all sides, enveloping the herd in a whirlwind of menace, cutting out his
victim as fast as it could rejoin its mates, wearing out the patience of
creatures preyed upon, which is a lesser patience than that of creatures
preying.

as the day

 cows he had known, the calves he had fathered, the bulls he
had mastered--as they shambled on at a rapid pace through the fading
light. he could not follow, for before his nose leaped the merciless
fanged terror that would not let him go. three hundredweight more than
half a ton he weighed; he had lived a long, strong life, full of fight
and struggle, and at the end he faced death at the teeth of a creature
whose head did not reach beyond his great knuckled knees.

from then on, night and day, buck never left his prey, never gave it a
moment‚Äôs rest, never permitted it to browse the leaves of trees or
the shoots of young birch and willow. nor did he give the wounded bull
opportunity to slake his burning thirst in the slender trickling streams
they crossed. often, in desperation, he burst into long stretches of
flight. at such times buck did not attempt to stay him, but loped easily
at his heels, satisfied with the way the game was played, lying down
when the moose stood still, attacking

him fiercely when he strove to eat
or drink.

the great head drooped more and more under its tree of horns, and
the shambling trot grew weak and weaker. he took to standing for long
periods, with nose to the ground and dejected ears dropped limply; and
buck found more time in which to get water for himself and in which to
rest. at such moments, panting with red lolling tongue and with eyes
fixed upon the big bull, it appeared to buck that a change was coming
over the face of things. he could feel a new stir in the land. as the
moose were coming into the land, other kinds of life were coming in.
forest and stream and air seemed palpitant with their presence. the news
of it was borne in upon him, not by sight, or sound, or smell, but by
some other and subtler sense. he heard nothing, saw nothing, yet knew
that the land was somehow different; that through it strange things were
afoot and ranging; and he resolved to investigate

ed of it. several times he
stopped and drew in the fresh morning air in great sniffs, reading a
message which made him leap on with greater speed. he was oppressed with
a sense of calamity happening, if it were not calamity already happened;
and as he crossed the last watershed and dropped down into the valley
toward camp, he proceeded with greater caution.

three miles away he came upon a fresh trail that sent his neck hair
rippling and bristling, it led straight toward camp and john thornton.
buck hurried on, swiftly and stealthily, every nerve straining and
tense, alert to the multitudinous details which told a story--all but
the end. his nose gave him a varying description of the passage of the
life on the heels of which he was travelling. he remarked the pregnant
silence of the forest. the bird life had flitted. the squirrels were in
hiding. one only he saw,--a sleek gray fellow, flattened against a gray
dead limb so that he seemed a part of it, a woody excrescence upon the
wood itsel

as buck slid along with the obscureness of a gliding shadow, his nose
was jerked suddenly to the side as though a positive force had gripped
and pulled it. he followed the new scent into a thicket and found nig.
he was lying on his side, dead where he had dragged himself, an arrow
protruding, head and feathers, from either side of his body.

a hundred yards farther on, buck came upon one of the sled-dogs thornton
had bought in dawson. this dog was thrashing about in a death-struggle,
directly on the trail, and buck passed around him without stopping. from
the camp came the faint sound of many voices, rising and falling in a
sing-song chant. bellying forward to the edge of the clearing, he found
hans, lying on his face, feathered with arrows like a porcupine. at the
same instant buck peered out where the spruce-bough lodge had been and
saw what made his hair leap s

a gust of overpowering rage swept over him. he did not know that he
growled, but he growled aloud with a terrible ferocity. for the last
time in his life he allowed passion to usurp cunning and reason, and it
was because of his great love for john thornton that he lost his head.

the yeehats were dancing about the wreckage of the spruce-bough lodge
when they heard a fearful roaring and saw rushing upon them an animal
the like of which they had never seen before. it was buck, a live
hurricane of fury, hurling himself upon them in a frenzy to destroy. he
sprang at the foremost man (it was the chief of the yeehats), ripping
the throat wide open till the rent jugular spouted a fountain of blood.
he did not pause to worry the victim, but ripped in passing, with
the next bound tearing wide the throat of a second man. there was
no withstanding him. he plunged about in their very midst, tearing,
rending, destroying, in constant and terrific motion which defied the
arrows

they discharged at him. in fact, so inconceivably rapid were his
movements, and so closely were the indians tangled together, that they
shot one another with the arrows; and one young hunter, hurling a spear
at buck in mid air, drove it through the chest of another hunter with
such force that the point broke through the skin of the back and stood
out beyond. then a panic seized the yeehats, and they fled in terror to
the woods, proclaiming as they fled the advent of the evil spirit.

and truly buck was the fiend incarnate, raging at their heels and
dragging them down like deer as they raced through the trees. it was
a fateful day for the yeehats. they scattered far and wide over the
country, and it was not till a week later that the last of the survivors
gathered together in a lower valley and counted their losses. as for
buck, wearying of the pursuit, he returned to the desolated camp. he
found pete where he had been killed in his blankets in the first moment
of surprise. thornton‚Äôs de

sperate struggle was fresh-written on the
earth, and buck scented every detail of it down to the edge of a deep
pool. by the edge, head and fore feet in the water, lay skeet, faithful
to the last. the pool itself, muddy and discolored from the sluice
boxes, effectually hid what it contained, and it contained john
thornton; for buck followed his trace into the water, from which no
trace led away.

all day buck brooded by the pool or roamed restlessly about the camp.
death, as a cessation of movement, as a passing out and away from the
lives of the living, he knew, and he knew john thornton was dead. it
left a great void in him, somewhat akin to hunger, but a void which
ached and ached, and which food could not fill, at times, when he paused
to contemplate the carcasses of the yeehats, he forgot the pain of it;
and at such times he was aware of a great pride in himself,--a pride
greater than any he ha

he sniffed the bodies curiously. they had died so easily. it was harder
to kill a husky dog than them. they were no match at all, were it
not for their arrows and spears and clubs. thenceforward he would be
unafraid of them except when they bore in their hands their arrows,
spears, and clubs.

night came on, and a full moon rose high over the trees into the sky,
lighting the land till it lay bathed in ghostly day. and with the coming
of the night, brooding and mourning by the pool, buck became alive to a
stirring of the new life in the forest other than that which the yeehats
had made, he stood up, listening and scenting. from far away drifted a
faint, sharp yelp, followed by a chorus of similar sharp yelps. as the
moments passed the yelps grew closer and louder. again buck knew them
as things heard in that other world which persisted in his memory. he
walked to the centre of the open space and listened. it was the call,
the many-noted call, sounding more luringly and compelli

ngly than ever
before. and as never before, he was ready to obey. john thornton was
dead. the last tie was broken. man and the claims of man no longer bound
him.

hunting their living meat, as the yeehats were hunting it, on the flanks
of the migrating moose, the wolf pack had at last crossed over from the
land of streams and timber and invaded buck‚Äôs valley. into the clearing
where the moonlight streamed, they poured in a silvery flood; and in the
centre of the clearing stood buck, motionless as a statue, waiting their
coming. they were awed, so still and large he stood, and a moment‚Äôs
pause fell, till the boldest one leaped straight for him. like a flash
buck struck, breaking the neck. then he stood, without movement, as
before, the stricken wolf rolling in agony behind him. three others
tried it in sharp succession; and one after the other they drew back,
streaming blood from slashed throats or shoulders.

this was sufficient to fling the whole pack forward, pell-mel

l, crowded
together, blocked and confused by its eagerness to pull down the
prey. buck‚Äôs marvellous quickness and agility stood him in good stead.
pivoting on his hind legs, and snapping and gashing, he was everywhere
at once, presenting a front which was apparently unbroken so swiftly did
he whirl and guard from side to side. but to prevent them from getting
behind him, he was forced back, down past the pool and into the creek
bed, till he brought up against a high gravel bank. he worked along to a
right angle in the bank which the men had made in the course of mining,
and in

 protected on three sides and with
nothing to do but face the front.

and so well did he face it, that at the end of half an hour the wolves
drew back discomfited. the tongues of all were out and lolling, the
white fangs showing cruelly white in the moonlight. some were lying down
with heads raised and ears pricked forward; others stood on their feet,
watching him; and still others were lapping water from the pool. one
wolf, long and lean and gray, advanced cautiously, in a friendly manner,
and buck recognized the wild brother with whom he had run for a night
and a day. he was whining softly, and, as buck whined, they touched
noses.

then an old wolf, gaunt and battle-scarred, came forward. buck writhed
his lips into the preliminary of a snarl, but sniffed noses with him,
whereupon the old wolf sat down, pointed nose at the moon, and broke
out the long wolf howl. the others sat down and howled. and now the call
came to buck in unmistakable accents. he, too, sat down and howled. this
over,

he came out of his angle and the pack crowded around him, sniffing
in half-friendly, half-savage manner. the leaders lifted the yelp of the
pack and sprang away into the woods. the wolves swung in behind, yelping
in chorus. and buck ran with them, side by side with the wild brother,
yelping as he ran.

   *  *  *  *  *

and here may well end the story of buck. the years were not many when
the yeehats noted a change in the breed of timber wolves; for some were
seen with splashes of brown on head and muzzle, and with a rift of white
centring down the chest. but more remarkable than this, the yeehats tell
of a ghost dog that runs at the head of the pack. they are afraid of
this ghost dog, for it has cunning greater than they, stealing from
their camps in fierce winters, robbing their traps, slaying their dogs,
and defying their bravest hunters.

nay, t
