room. each night, as he waited to hear from my mother, he chipped away at
that wall.

   on the night that we got the bad news - that she was not returning - he
pounded and pounded on that wall with a chisel and a hammer. at two
o'clock in the morning, he came up to my room. i was not asleep. he led me
downstairs and showed me what he had found. hidden behind the wall was a
brick fireplace.

   the reason that phoebe's story reminds me of that plaster wail and the
hidden fireplace is that beneath phoebe's story was another one. it was about
me and my own mother.


2. the chickabiddy starts a story


   it was after all the adventures of phoebe that my grand- parents came up
with a plan to drive from kentucky to ohio, where they would pick me up,
and then the three of us would drive two thousand miles west to lewiston,

idaho. this is how j came to be locked in a car with them for nearly a week.
it was not a trip that i was eager to go on, but it was one i had to take.

is trip will give me a chance to be
with my favorite chickabiddy again.' i am, by the way, their only
chickabiddy.

   my father said that gram couldn't read maps worth a hill of beans and that
he was grateful that i had agreed to go along and help them find their way. i
was only thirteen, and although i did have a way with maps, it was not really
because of that skill that i was going, nor was it to see the 'whole ding-dong
country' that gram and gramps were going. the real reasons were buried
beneath piles and piles of unsaid things.

   some of the real reasons were:

   1. gram and gramps wanted to see momma who was resting peacefully in
lewiston. idaho.

   2. gram and gramps knew that i wanted to see momma, but that i was
afraid to.

   3. dad wanted to be alone with the red-headed margaret cadaver. he had
already seen momma and he had not taken me. also - although this wasn't
as important - i think dad did not trust gram and gramps to behave
themselves along the way unless they had

to talk about her.

   gramps said, 'well, then, what about your friends? you got any tales to
tell about them?'

   instantly, phoebe winterbottom came to mind. there was certainly a hog's
bellyful of things to tell about her. 'i could tell you an extensively strange
story,' i warned.

   'oh, good!' gram said. 'delicious!' and that is how i happened to suspend
my tree prayers and tell them about phoebe winterbottom, her disappearing
mother, and the lunatic. it is also how i discovered that beneath phoebe's
story was another story.


3. bravery


   because i first saw phoebe on the day my father and i moved to euclid, i
began my story of phoebe with the visit to the red-headed margaret
cadaver's where i also met mrs.. partridge, her elderly mother. margaret
nearly fell over herself being nice to me. 'what lovely hair,' she said, and

'aren't you sweet!' i was not sweet that day. i was being particularly ornery.
i wouldn't sit down and i wouldn't look at margaret.

   as we were leav

   they all seemed to talk quite a lot, and everyone seemed to have braces on
their teeth. one girl, mary lou finney, said the most peculiar things, like out
of the blue she would say, 'omnipotent!' or 'beef brain!' i couldn't make any
sense of it. there were japanese twins (a brother and sister), who didn't
speak at all except to say 'yes, yes,' and 'yes, yes.' there were megan and
christy who jumped up and down like parched peas, moody beth ann, and
pink-cheeked alex. there was ben who drew cartoons all day long, and a
most peculiar teacher named mr. birkway.

   and then there was phoebe winterbottom. ben called her 'free-bee ice
bottom' and drew a picture of a bumble-bee with an ice cube on its bottom.
phoebe tore it up.

   phoebe was a quiet girl. she stayed mostly by herself and seemed quite
shy. she had the most pleasant face and huge, enormous sky-blue eyes.
around this pleasant round face, her hair curled in short ringlets as yellow as
a crow's foot.

and their eyes open widely and their mouths turn down at the corners.

   once i asked my mother why grandmother and grandfather pickford
never laughed. my mother said, 'they're just so busy being respectable. it
takes a lot of concentration to be that respectable.' and then m~ mother
laughed and laughed, in a friendly, gentle way, and her own spine was not
made of steel, you could tell, because she bent in half, laughing and
laughing.

   my mother said that grandmother pickford's one single act of defiance in
her life as a pickford was in naming my mother. grandmother pickford,
whose own name is gayfeather, named my mother chanhassen. it's an
indian name, meaning 'tree sweet juice', or - in other words - maple sugar.
only grandmother pickford ever called my mother by her indian name,
though. everyone else called my mother 'sugar'.

   most of the time, my mother seemed nothing like her paren

my father and i had already eaten breakfast, and he was out in the fields. on
the table, my father had left a single flower in each of two juice glasses - a
black- eyed susan in front of my place, and a white petunia in front of my
mother's my father must have gone out to the field and picked them as soon
as he had awakened.

   when my mother came into the kitchen that day, she saw the flowers
immediately. 'oh!' she said. 'glory!' she bent her face toward each flower.
she looked out the window and said, 'let's go find him.'


   we climbed the hill to the barn, crawled between the fence wires and
crossed the field. my father was standing at the far end of the field, his back
to us, hands on his hips, looking at a section of fence.

homesick for bybanks.

   'why, you gooseberry,' gramps said. 'that's where we've been the past
three hours, barrelling through indiana. you've been listening to the story of
peeby and plumb missed indiana. don't you remember elkhart? we ate

thought this was very funny.

   'you know how it got called the hoosier state?' he said.

   'no, i do not,' gram said. i think she was a little angry that she had missed
indiana.

   gramps said, 'whenever you go up to a house here in indiana, the people

imagination.


9. the message


   just before we reached mary lou's house, phoebe said, 'mary lou's family
is not nearly as civilized as ours.'

   'in what way?' i asked.

   'oh, you'll see,' phoebe said.

   mary lou finney and ben finney were both in our class at school. at first,
i thought mary lou and ben were sister and brother, but phoebe told me
they were cousins ben was living with mary lou's family temporarily.
apparently, there was always at least one stray relative living at the finneys
temporarily.

   it was complete pandemonium at the finneys mary lou had an older sister
and three brothers. in addition, there were her parents and ben. there were
footballs and basketballs lying all over the place, and boys sli

t phoebe and i met the potential lunatic and then went over
to mary lou's, a couple of other peculiar things happened. we were sitting
on the floor of mary lou's room, sorting through a huge pile of old shoes
and crumpled belts. phoebe was telling mary lou about the mysterious
potential lunatic. mary lou's brothers, dennis, doug and tommy, kept
dashing in and out of the room, jumping over the pile of shoes and belts and
leaping on the bed and squirting us with squirt guns.

   mary lou's cousin ben was lying on her bed, staring at me with his black,
black eyes. they looked like two sparkly black discs set into big, round

sockets. his dark eyelashes were long and feathery, casting little shadows on
his cheeks.

   'i like your hair,' he said to me. 'can you sit on it?'

   'yes, if i want.'

   ben picked up a piece of paper from mary lou's desk, lay back down on
the bed and started drawing.

   mary lou asked phoebe what she had written in her journal. 'nothing
much,' phoebe said. the j

ournals were a big topic of conversation at school.
at the end of the last school year, apparently, their english teacher asked
each of them to keep a journal for the summer. they had to turn these in to
mr. birkway, the new english teacher, on the first day of school. now
every- one seemed enormously curious as to what everyone else had written.
i was relieved that i had not had to submit one, since i was new at the school
and didn't know about the journal assignment.

   ben said, 'want to see?' and he held his drawing over the edge of the bed.
it was a picture of two figures. one was a lizard-like creature with long
black hair that, as it ran down the lizard's back and under its bottom, became
a chair with legs. underneath this, ben had written.' salamander sitting on
her hair'. the other figure was a huge bumble-bee with tiny little blue jeans
on its legs and a short crew cut on its head. underneath this, ben had
written, 'free bee'.

her.

   i turned around to hand the drawing back to ben, just as he leaned forward
and mashed his lips into my collarbone. his lips rested there a moment. my
nose was pressed into his hair, which smelled like grapefruit. it was his
shampoo, i suppose. then he rolled off the bed, grabbed the drawing and
dashed out of the room.

   did he actually kiss my collarbone? and if he did, why did he do that? if i
had not turned when i did, would the kiss have ended up somewhere else,
like on my mouth, for example? that was a rather chilling thought. the

   'oh, really?' phoebe said.

   'i used to imagine that there were two moons sitting in a pair of indian
shoes, but my father said it means that you shouldn't judge someone until
you've walked in their moccasins. until you've been in their shoes. in their
place.'

   'and your father says this often?' phoebe said.

   'i know what you're thinking,' i said, 'but my father isn't creeping around
leaving those messages. it isn't his handwriting.'

   when ben came into mary lou's room, she asked him what he thought it
meant. he took a sheet of paper from her desk and quickly drew a cartoon. it
was a little spooky, because what he drew was almost identical to what i
used to imagine a pair of indian moccasins with two moons in them.


   'maybe,' mary lou said to phoebe, 'your father is being too quick to judge
people at work. he needs to walk in their moccasins first.'

   'my father does not judge too quickly,' phoebe said.

   'you don't have to g

   'i am not getting defensive. i'm just telling you that my father does not
judge too quickly.'

   later, we went to the drug store. i thought it was going to be only me and
phoebe and mary lou going, but by the time we left the house, we had
accumulated tommy and dougie as well. at the last minute, ben said he
was coming too.

   'i don't know how you can stand it.' phoebe said to mary lou.

   'stand what:''

   phoebe pointed to tommy and dougie, who were running around like
wound-up toys, making aeroplane and train noises and zooming in between
us and then running up ahead and falling over each other and crying and
then leaping back up again and socking each other and chasing after bumble-
bees.

   'oh, i'm used to it,' mary lou said. 'my brothers are always doing beef-
brained things'

 
 
 ___________________________
 
  ben walked right behind me all the way, which made me a little nervous. i
kept turning around to see what he was doing back there, but he was just
strolling along smiling.

   tommy bashed into me, and when i started to fall backwards, ben caught
me. he put his arms right around my waist and held on to me, even after it
was obvious that i was not going to fall. i could smell that funny grapefruit
smell again and feel his face pressed up against my hair.

   'let go,' i said, but he didn't let go. i had an odd sensation, as if a little
creature was crawling up my spine. it wasn't a horrible sensation, more light

and tickly. i thought maybe he dropped something down my shirt. 'let go!' i
said, and finally he did.

   it was at th

e drug store that i got a little scared. i suppose i had been
listening to phoebe's tales of lunatics and axe murderers too much. phoebe
and i were looking at the magazines, when i felt as if someone was watching
us. i looked over to where ben was standing, but he and mary lou were
busy rummaging around in the chocolate bars. the feeling did not go away. i
turned the other way around, and there on the far side of the store was the
nervous young man who had come to phoebe's house. he was at the cash
register, paying for something, but he was staring at us while he was handing
his money to the clerk. i nudged phoebe.

   'oh, no,' she said, 'the lunatic.'

   she hustled over to ben and mary lou. 'look, quick,' phoebe said. 'it's the

at mary lou's for a little longer before we started back to phoebe's house.
we were only about a block away when we heard someone running up
behind us

   phoebe thought we were doomed. 'if we get our heads bashed in and he
leaves us here on the sidewalk--' she said.

   i felt a hand on my shoulder and i opened my mouth to scream, but
nothing came out. my brain was saying, 'scream! scream!' but my voice was
completely shut off.


   it was ben. he said, 'did i scare you?'

   'that wasn't very funny,' phoebe said.

   'i'll walk home with you,' he said. 'just in case there are any - any - lunatics
around.' he had difficulty saying the word 'lunatic'.

   on the way to phoebe's house ben said some odd things. first, he said.
'maybe you shouldn't call him a lunatic.

   'and why not?' phoebe said.

   'because a lunatic is - it means - it sounds like oh, never mind.' he would
not explain, and he seemed embarrassed to have mentioned thi

   'you do.' he touched my arm. i have to admit, my instinct was to flinch
but i caught myself i pretended not to notice that his hand was resting there
on my arm. that creature tickling my spine was back.

   'hmm,' he said, like a doctor examining a patient. 'hmm.' he removed his
hand. then he said, 'where's your mother?'

   i had not mentioned my mother to anyone, not even phoebe, except for the
one time phoebe had asked about her and i had only said she didn't live with
us.


   ben said, 'i saw your father once, but i've never seen your mother. where
is she?'

   'she's in idaho. lewiston, idaho.'

   'what's she doing there?' ben said.

   'i don't really feel like saying.' it didn't occur to me to ask him where his
mother was.

   he touched my arm again. when i flinched, he said. 'ha! gotcha!'

   it bothered me, what he had said. it occurred to me that my father didn't
hug me quite as much any more, and that maybe i was starting to flinch
whenever anyone did touch me.
 
 ___________________________
 
 i wasn't always like that. before - before
everything went all wrong - we were a hugging family. as i walked along
with ben and phoebe, t saw a picture in my mind of my mother with her
arms around me. i saw another picture of myself when i was three years old.
my mother was carrying me on her back up to the barn. my arms were
wrapped around her neck and my face was tickled by her hair. her hair
smelled like roses. she licked the skin on my arm and said, 'um, you're a
delicious salamanca tree, a most delicious salamanca tree.'

   i saw another vision of myself when i was nine or ten. my mother crawled
into bed with

me and snuggled close and said, 'let's build a raft and float
away down a river.' i used to think about that raft a lot, and i actually
believed that one day we might build a raft and float away down a river
together. but when she went to lewiston, idaho, she went alone.

   ben touched phoebe's arm. she flinched. 'ha,' he said. 'gotcha. you're
jumpy, too, free bee.'

   and that surprised me. i had already noticed how tense phoebe's whole
family seemed, how tidy, how respectable, and how thumpingly stiff. was i
becoming like that? why were they like that? a couple of times i had seen
phoebe's mother try to touch phoebe or prudence or mr. winterbottom, but
they all drew back from her. it was as if they had outgrown her.

   had i been drawing away from my own mother? d

   when we reached phoebe's driveway. ben said, 'i guess you're safe now. i
guess i'll go.

   'go ahead.' phoebe said.

   we stood there. he stood there. mrs. cadaver came screeching up to the
kerb in her yellow volkswagen, with her wild red witch hair flying all over
the place. she waved at us and then started pulling things out of the car and
plopping them on the sidewalk.

   'who's that?' ben asked.

   'mrs. cadaver.'

   'cadaver? like dead body?'

   'that's right.'

   'hi, sal!' mrs. cadaver called. she was dumping a huge pile of lumpy bags
on the sidewalk. ben walked over and asked if she wanted any help carrying
things inside.

   'my, you're very polite,' mrs. cadaver said, flashing her wild gray eyes.

   'she scares me half to death,' phoebe said.

   phoebe's mother came to her front door. 'phoebe? what are you doing?
are you coming in? who is that?' she was pointing to b

   phoebe whispered to ben, 'don't go inside.

   'why not?' he said, rather too loudly, because mrs. cadaver looked up and
said, 'why not what?'

   'oh, nothing,' phoebe said.

   mrs. cadaver said, 'sal, do you want to come in?'

   'i was just going to phoebe's,' i said, glad for an excuse.


   phoebe pulled on ben's sleeve. 'what's the matter', he asked.

   'is something the matter?' mrs. cadaver said in her crackly dead-leaf
voice.

   'phoebe!' her mother called. 'sweetie!'

   we left ben. just as we were going into phoebe's house, we turned around
and saw ben lift something off the sidewalk. it was a shiny, new axe.

   phoebe's mother said, 'is that mary lou's brother? was he walking you
home? where's mary lou?'

   'i hate it when you ask me three questions in a row, phoebe said. through

w, we could see ben lugging the axe up the front steps of mrs.
cadaver's house. phoebe opened the window and called out, 'don't go in!'
but when mrs. cadaver held the front door open, ben disappeared inside.

   'phoebe, what are you doing?' her mother asked.

   then phoebe pulled the envelope out of her pocket, the envelope
containing the latest message. 'i found this outside,' phoebe said.

   mrs. winterbottom opened the envelope carefully, as if it might contain a
miniature bomb. she read it.

   'oh, sweetie,' she said. 'who is it from? who is it for? what does it mean?'

   phoebe explained what an agenda was.

   'i know what an agenda is, phoebe,' she said. 'i don't lik

e this at all. i want
to know who is sending these.'

   i was waiting for phoebe to tell her about seeing the nervous young man at
the drug store, but phoebe didn't mention it.

   it was with great relief that we saw ben leave mrs. cadaver's house a little
later. he appeared to be all in one piece.


   that day, when i got home, my father was in the garage, tinkering with the
car. he was leaning over the engine, and i couldn't see his face at first.

   'dad -- what do you think it means if someone touches someone else and
the person being touched flinches? do you think it means that the person
being touched is getting too stiff? i mean, let's say a person didn't used to
flinch, but now-

   dad turned slowly

   i said, 'how do you mean?'

   'everybody is just walking along concerned with his own problems, his
own life, his own little worries. and, we're all expecting other people to tune
into our own agenda. "look at my worry. worry with me. step into my life.
care about my problems. care about me. gram sighed.

   gramps was scratching his head. 'you turning into a philosopher or
something?'

   'mind your own agenda,' she said.

   when i mentioned about ben asking where my mother was and my saying
that she was in lewiston, but that i didn't want to elaborate. gram and
gramps looked at each other.


   gramps said. 'one time when my father took off for six months and didn't
tell anybody where he was going, and my best friend asked me where my
father was, i hauled off and punched him in the jaw. my best friend. i
punched him right in the jaw.'

   'you never told me that,' gram said. 'i hope he socked you back.'

   gramps opened his mouth and poin

knocked my tooth right out.

   and when i told gram and gramps about flinching when ben touched me
and about how i went home and found dad in the garage, gram unbuckled
her seat belt, turned all the way around and leaned over the back of her seat.
she took my hand and kissed it.

   gramps said, 'give her one for me, too,' and so gram kissed my hand
again.

   several times, when i described phoebe's world of lunatics and axe
murderers, gram said, 'just like gloria, i swear to goodness. just exactly like
gloria.' once, after she said this, gramps got a dreamy look on his face and

these roads are taking the poop out of me.

   the detour to pipestone wound through a cool, dark forest and, if you
closed your eyes and smelled the air. you could smell bybanks. kentucky.
pipestone was a small town. everywhere we went, people were talking to
each other: standing there talking, or sitting on a bench talking, or walking
along the street talking. when we passed by, they looked up at us, right into
our faces and said 'hi' or 'howdy', and, although it sounds a little corny to
say it we felt right at home there. it was so like bybanks, where everyone
you see stops to say something because they know you and have known you
their whole lives.

   we went to the pipestone national monument and saw indians thunking
away at the stone in the quarry. i asked one if he was a native american, but

him. i thought he might have a few squirrels in the attic of his brain. he was
one of those energetic teachers who loved his subject half to death and
leaped about the room dramatically, waving his arms and clutching his chest
and patting people on the back.

   he said, 'brilliant!' and 'wonderful!' and 'terrific!' he was quite tall and
slim, and his bushy black hair made him look like a wild native at times, but
he had enormous deep brown cow like eyes that sparkled all over the place
(like ben's), and when he turned these eyes on you, you felt as if his whole
purpose in life was to stand there and listen to you, and you alone.

   midway through the first class, mr. birkway asked if we had our summer
journals. i hadn't a clue as to what he was talking about. some of the other
students started nodding like crazy, and mr. birkway spread out his arms
and said, 'wonderful! i'm blessed!' he flung himself up and down the aisles,
receiving the journals as if they were manna from heaven. 'th

brilliant!
thank you!'

   another girl, beth ann, looked as if she might cry. phoebe was sending
me little messages with her eye- brows that indicated that she was not too
pleased either. i think they were all hoping that mr. birkway was not
actually going to read these journals.

   mr. birkway went around the whole room snatching people's journals.
alex cheevey's journal was covered with basketball stickers. christy's and
megan's were slathered over with pictures of male models. the cover of
ben's was a cartoon of a boy with a normal boy's head, but the arms and legs
were pencils, and out of the tips of the hands and feet were little bits of
words

   when he got to phoebe's desk, mr. birkway lifted up her plain journal and
peeked inside. phoebe was trying to slide down in her chair. 'i didn't write
much,' phoebe said. 'in fact. i can hardly remember what i wrote about at all.
mr. birkway only said, 'beautiful! and moved on.

   by the time he got to my desk, my heart was clobbering ar

that is better than a new person!'

   'so, i didn't know about the journals--'


   'not to worry!' mr. birkway said. 'i'll think of something.'

   i wasn't sure what that meant. i thought maybe he would give me a whole
lot of extra homework or something. for the rest of the day you could see
little groups of people asking each other, 'did you write about me?' i was
very glad i hadn't written anything.

   after school, phoebe and i walked home with mary lou and ben, who
were excited about mr. birkway. 'isn't he terrific?' they said. at the corner of
my street, as i turned to leave, ben said to phoebe, 'hey, free bee! did you
write about me?'

   for a while, we did not hear any more about the journals. we had
absolutely no idea of all the trouble they were going to cause.

mother was running errands. mrs. winterbottom had read out a long list to
us of where s

   it was hotter than blazes in south dakota. i started getting worried in
sioux falls, when gramps took off his shirt. passing mitchell, gram
unbuttoned her dress down to her waist. just beyond chamberlain, gramps
got off the freeway and took a detour to the missouri river. he parked the
car beneath a tree overlooking a sandy bank.

   gram and gramps kicked off their shoes and stood in the water. it was
quiet and hot, hot, hot. all you could hear was a crow calling somewhere up
river and the distant sound of cars along the highway. the scorching air
pressed against my face, and my hair was like a hot, heavy blanket draped
on my neck and back. it was so hot you could smell the heat baking the
stones and dirt along the bank.

like mine, but a week before she left, she cut it. my father said to me, 'don't

   my mother said, 'i knew you wouldn't like it if i cut mine.'

   my father said, 'i didn't say anything about yours.

   'but, i know what you're thinking,' she said.

   'i loved your hair, sugar,' he said.

   i saved her hair. i swept it up from the kitchen floor and wrapped it in a
plastic bag and hid it beneath the floorboards of my room. it was still there,
along with the postcards she sent.

   as gram, gramps and i sat in the missouri river, i tried not to think of the
postcards. i tried to concentrate on the high sky and the cool water. it would
have been perfect except for that ornery crow calling away: car-car-car. 'will
we be here long?' i asked.

   the boy came out of nowhere. gramps saw him first and whispered, 'get
behind me, chickabiddy. you too, he said to gram. the boy was about

d was coming from
somewhere in the top of one of those trees, and i thought instantly of the
singing tree in bybanks.

   next to my favourite sugar maple tree beside the barn is a tall aspen. it is
out of place there. all the other aspens on the farm grow near the river in
groves. when i was younger, i heard the most beautiful birdsong coming
from the top of that tree. it was not a call; it was a true birdsong, with trills
and warbles up and down the scale it went in a delicate melody. i stood
beneath that tree for the longest time, hoping to catch sight of the bird who
was singing such a song. i saw no bird - only leaves waving in the breeze.
the longer i stared up at the leaves, the more it seemed that it was the tree
itself that was singing. every time i passed that tree, i listened. sometimes it
sang, sometimes it did not, but from then on i always called it the singing
tree.

   the morning after my father learned that my mother was not coming back,
he left for lewiston, idaho. gram

that she would be back before the tulips bloomed.

   but, of course, she was not back before the tulips bloomed.

   it nearly killed my father after she left, i know it, but he continued doing
everything just as before, whistling and humming and finding little gifts for
people. he kept bringing home gifts for my mother and stacking them in a
pile in their bedroom.

   on that night that he found out she wasn't coming back, he chipped away
at the plaster wall and discovered the brick fireplace beneath. the next day
he flew to lewiston, idaho, and when he came back, he did nothing for three
days but chip and chip until every last piece of plaster was removed from
that fireplace and every brick was scrubbed. some of the cement grouting

had to be replaced and i saw that he had written her name in tiny letters in
the new cement. he wrote chanhassen, not sugar.

   three weeks later he put the farm up for sale. by this time, he was
receiving letters from mrs. cadaver, and i knew that he was

knew one story about an old warrior who came back as a potato.

   the next thing i knew, mr. birkway was saying, 'right phoebe? phoebe?
are you awake? you have the second report.

   'report?' phoebe said.

   'lucky you! we're letting you go second!'

   'report?'

   mr. birkway clutched his heart and said to the class, 'apparently, miss
phoebe winterbottom did not hear me explain about the reports perhaps you
can enlighten her, mr. finney.

   ben turned slowly around in his chair and cast his sparkling black eyes in
phoebe's direction. he said, 'i'm doing an oral report on prometheus this
friday. you're doing one on pandora next monday.'

   'lucky me,' phoebe muttered. mr. birkway asked me to stay after class for
a minute. phoebe sent me warning messages with her eyebrows. as
everyone else was leaving the room, phoebe said, 'i'll stay with you if you
want.'

   'why?'

   'because, sal, because.'

   'because of what?' i said.

anything at all.'

   phoebe said, 'could she write about murderers?'

   mr. birkway said, 'goodness! is that something that interests you, sal? or
is it something that interests you, phoebe?'

   'oh, no, sir,' phoebe said.

   'i think.' mr. birkway said, 'you should keep it more simple. write about
something you like  - a place, a room. a person - don't worry about it too
much. just write whatever comes to mind.'

   phoebe and i walked home with mary lou and ben. my brain was a mess,
what with trying not to flinch whenever ben brushed against me. when we
left ben and mary lou and turned the corner into phoebe's street, i wasn't
paying much attention. i suppose i was aware that someone was coming
along the sidewalk in our direction, but it wasn't until the person was about
three feet away that i really took notice.

   it was phoebe's lunatic, coming toward us, staring right at us. he stopped
directly in front of us, blocking our way.

sed all different kinds of
trees, and each family of trees - oaks, maples, elms, birches - had a special
flavour all of its own. mixed in with each tree's own taste was the slight tang
of blackberries, and why this was so, i could not explain.

   the next day, i turned in this story to mr. birkway. he didn't read it or
even look at it, but he said, 'marvelous! brilliant!' as he slipped it into his
briefcase. 'i'll put it with the other journals'


   phoebe said, 'did you write about me?'

   ben said, 'did you write about me?'

   mr. birkway was bounding around the room as if the opportunity to teach
us was his notion of paradise. he threw open the windows and sucked in the
air. 'ah, september,' he said. he pulled out a book and read a poem by e. e,
cummings. the poem was titled 'the little horse is newly' and the reason why
the only capital letter in the title is the 'y' at the end of newly' is because
mr. cummings liked to do it that way.

   'he probably never took english,' phoebe

fter that, i couldn't make a lot of sense out of anything
except that this horse feels amazing and lives in a 'smooth beautifully folded'
world. i liked that. i was not sure what it was, but i liked it. everything
sounded soft and safe.

   thus far, it was not an unusual sort of day, purely normal as far as school
goes. i started walking home alone, because phoebe had left early for a
dentist appointment. i was supposed to meet her at her house at five o'clock.
i didn't even mind too much when ben came running up behind me, because
i was in a good mood and besides, i didn't really want to walk home by
myself.

   i was completely unprepared for what happened on the way home, and of
course for what happened later. ben and i were simply walking along and he
said, 'did anyone ever read your palm?'

   'no.

   'i know how to do it,' he said. 'want me to read yours?' we were passing a
bus stop and there was a wooden bench on the sidewalk. ben said, 'come
on, sit down. i can't do it while we'

the sun was beating down on us, and i thought it might be nice to sit there
for ever with him just running his finger along my palm like that. i thought
about the newly born horse who knows nothing and feels everything. i
thought about the smooth beautifully folded world. finally, ben said, 'do
you want the good news first or the bad news?'

   'the bad news. it isn't real bad, is it?'

   he coughed. 'the bad news is that i can't really read palms'

   i snatched my hand away, grabbed my books, and started walking away.

   'don't you want to know the good news?' he asked.

   i kept walking.

   'the good news is' he said, 'that you let me hold your hand for almost ten
minutes and you didn't flinch once.'

   i didn't know quite what to make of him. he walked me all the wa

   he didn't say anything. in fact, neither of us said anything. he was reading
his book and taking notes i tried to read mine, but it was difficult to think
with him sitting there. i was relieved when it was time to go to phoebe's.


   when we passed mrs. cadaver's house, someone called my name. i didn't
see anyone at first, but then i spotted mrs. partridge sitting in a lawn chair
beside the house.

   'hello,' i said.

   'who's that?' ben asked.

   'mrs. partridge. she's blind.'

   he gave me a queer look. 'then, how did she know who you were?' it was
a good question, but i did not know how to answer it. when i knocked at
phoebe's door, ben said,' i'll be going now.

   i took a quick look at him and turned back to the door, but in the instant
that i was turning my head, he leaned forward, and i do believe his lips
kissed my ear. i was not sure this was what he intended. in fact, i was not
sure it happened at all because, befo

   'i have to go,' i said.

   at the door, phoebe said, 'my mother has disappeared. sal, don't tell
anyone. don't tell a soul.'

   at home, my father was slumped over the photo album. he used to close
the album quickly when i came in the room, as if he were embarrassed to be
caught with it. lately, however, he didn't bother to close it. it was almost as
if he didn't have the strength to do that.

   on the opened page was a photo of my father and mother sitting in the
grass beneath the sugar maple. his arms were around her and she was sort of
folded into him. his face was pressed up next to hers and their hair blended
together. they looked like they were connected.

   'phoebe's mother went away,' i said.

   he looked up at me.

   'she left some notes. she says she's coming back. but i don't believe it.

   i went upstairs and tried to work on my mythology report. my father came
to the doorway and said. 'people usually come back.

seemed that no two people had drawn the same thing inside. there was a
cross, a dark scribble, an eye, a mouth, a window.

   inside phoebe's was a teardrop.


   then mary lou said, 'look at that - two are exactly the same.' people were
saying, 'geez' and, 'wow' and, 'whose are those?'

   the duplicate designs were: a circle with a large maple leaf in the centre,
the tips of the leaf touching the sides of the circle.

   one of the maple leaf circles was mine. the other was ben's.

   i spent the next night at phoebe's house, but i could hardly sleep. phoebe
kept saying, 'hear that noise?' and she would jump up to peer out the
window in case it was the lunatic returning for the rest of us once, she saw
mrs. cadaver in her garden with a torch.

   i must have fallen asleep after that, because i awoke to the sound of
phoebe crying in her sleep. when i woke her, she denied it. 'i was not
crying. i most certainly was not.' in the morning, phoebe refused to

   'it's covent garden, cabbage-head,' mary lou said. 'it isn't,' christy said.
'i'm sure it's convent garden.

   by the time we reached english class, even mr. birkway had heard the
news. 'i hear your mother's in london, phoebe,' he said. 'london, ah,
london - the globe theatre, shakespeare, dickens, ah...


   after school, we walked home with ben and mary lou. phoebe wouldn't
say a word. 'whatsa matter, free bee?' ben asked. 'talk.'

   out of the blue. i said. 'everyone has his own agenda.' ben tripped over
the kerb, and mary lou gave me a peculiar look. i kept hoping that phoebe's
mother would be home. even though the door was locked, i kept hoping.
'are you sure you want me to come in?' i said. 'maybe you want to be alone.'

   phoebe said, 'i don 't want to be alone. call your dad and see if you can

   when their father came home, he seemed surprised to see dinner on the
table. prudence showed him the freezer contents. 'hm,' he said. at dinner,
we all ate rather quietly.

   'i  don't suppose you've  heard  anything - from mom?' prudence asked her
father.

   'not yet,' he said.

   'i think we should call the police,' phoebe said. 'phoebe.

   'i'm serious. i found some suspicious spots.' phoebe pointed toward two
adhesive-taped areas beneath the dining-room table.

   'what's that tape doing down there?' he asked.

   phoebe explained about the potential blood spots

   'blood?' prudence said. she stopped eating.

   phoebe pulled out the envelope and emptied the hair strands on the table
.'strange hairs' phoebe explained.

   prudence said. 'uck.'

phoebe's arm, and said, 'follow me.' he went to the refrigerator, opened the

sharp needles were shooting all up and down my leg. i tried to drag myself

black. there was a walloping buzzing in my head.

   i must have passed out again, because the next time i opened my eyes, the
woods were darker and the air was cooler. i heard my mother calling. her
voice was distant and faint, coming, i thought, from near the barn. i

   mary lou slammed the book closed and asked phoebe if she had heard
from her mother yet.

   'mm,' phoebe said.

   'you did? where is she staying? the hilton?'

   'mm,' phoebe said.

   'really? the hilton? wow.

   megan asked phoebe what sights her mother had seen.

   phoebe said, 'oh, buckingham palace--'

   'of course,' megan nodded, knowingly.

   'and big ben.'

   'naturally.'

   'and' phoebe was struggling a bit - 'shakespeare's birthplace.'

   'but, that's in stratford,' megan said. 'stratford-on- avon. i thought you
said your mother was in london. stratford is miles away. did she go on a
day-trip or something?'

   'yes, that's what she did. she went on a day-trip.'

   phoebe couldn't help it. she looked as if a whole family of the birds of
sadness were nesting in her hair. i think that what she most wanted to say
was, 'no! she isn't in londo
 
 ___________________________
 
n!  she disappeared!  she's been kid- napped!
she might be dead!'

   it was like that all day. by english class, her mother had not only been on
a day-trip to stratford, but she had also managed to visit scotland, wales
and ireland, and had had a lovely tour on a hovercraft. 'my,' beth ann said,
'your mother sure has been busy.'


   christy was cowering in a corner .'it's a wasp, sal - get it. kill it!' as i
ushered the wasp to an open window, mr. birkway asked ben to begin his
prometheus report. ben had to sit at mr. birkway's desk, facing the entire
class he could not stare down at his notes, because mr. birkway kept
saying, 'eye contact!' which meant ben had to look everyone directly in their
eyeballs. it was part of being a good speaker, mr. birkway said.

   ben was nervous he explained that prometheus stole fire from the sun and
gave it to man. zeus, the chief's god, was angry at man and at prometheus
for taking some of his precious sun. as punishme

nt. zeus sent pandora (a
woman) to man. ben did not explain why this was a punishment. then zeus
chained prometheus to a rock and sent vultures down to eat prometheus's
liver. in ben's nervousness, he mispronounced prometheus, so what he
actually said was that zeus sent vultures down to eat porpoise's liver.

   i tried to talk to ben after class ended, but when i tapped his arm, he pulled
it away as if my fingers were electric prongs phoebe said, 'it's the vultures of
nervousness zooming around his head.'

   mary lou invited both me and phoebe to dinner that night. when phoebe
started to hedge around, mary lou said, 'your mother's in london, anyway.
your father won't mind if you come over.

she agreed. my father, when i phoned him, did not seem t

   mary lou and i set the table, although i think it was largely a wasted
effort. everyone descended on the table in one huge, chaotic flurry,
knocking over glasses and sending forks onto the floor and picking up plates
(which did not match, phoebe pointed out to me) and saying, 'that's my
plate. i want the daisy plate,' and, 'give me the blue one! it's my turn for the
blue plate.

   phoebe and i sat between mary lou and ben. in the centre of the table was
a huge platter of fried chicken. phoebe said, 'chicken? fried? i can't eat fried
foods i have a sensitive stomach.' she glanced over at ben's plate. he had
taken three pieces of chicken. 'you really shouldn't eat that, ben. fried foods
are not good for you.  first of all, there's the cholesterol ...

on the serving platter. mr. finney coughed. mrs. finney said, 'you're not

examined them carefully. 'did you put butter on these beans, mrs. finney?'

   'yes, i did. is there something wrong with butter?'

   'cholesterol,' phoebe said. 'cho-les-ter-ol. in the butter.

   'ah,' mrs. finney said. 'cholesterol.' she looked at her husband. 'be
careful, dear. there's cholesterol on the beans.'

   i stared at phoebe. i am sure i was not the only one in the room who
wanted to strangle her.


   ben pushed his beans to one side of his plate. maggie picked up a bean
and examined it. when the potatoes came around, phoebe explained that she
was on a diet and could not eat starch. the rest of us looked glumly down at
our plates. there was nothing at all on phoebe's plate. mrs. finney said. 'so
what do you eat, phoebe?'

   'my mother makes special vegetarian meals. low calorie and no
cholesterol. we eat a lot of salads and vegetables. my mother's an excellent
cook.

   it went on and on like that. i hated her that day. i didn't care how upset she
was about her mother, i really hated her, and i wanted her to leave. i
wondered if this was how my father felt when i threw all those temper
tantrums. maybe he hated me for a while.

   after dinner, we walked over to mary lou's mr. and mrs. finney were
rolling around on the front lawn in a pile of leaves with tommy and dougie,
and ben was sitting on the porch. i sat down beside him while phoebe went
looking for mary lou.

   ben said, 'phoebe's driving you crazy, isn't she?' i liked the way he looked
right in your eyes when he talked to you.

   'extensively.' i said.

   'her mother isn't really in london, is she?'

   'what makes you say that?'

   he looked a bit sad. 'i don't know. i expect phoebe is just feeling lonely.

he lay down on the roof and put his arm around her. he kissed her.

me feel peculiar. they reminded me of my parents, before the stillborn baby,
before the operation.

   ben came into the kitchen. as he reached into the cupboard for a glass, he
stopped and looked at me. again i had that odd sensation that i wanted to
touch his face, right there on his cheek, in that soft spot. i was afraid my
hand might just lift up and drift over to him if i was not careful. it was most
peculiar.

   'guess where mary lou is?' phoebe said when she came in. 'she's with

   phoebe was afraid of mr. birkway. she was completely convinced that he
was a murderer. her hands shook as she picked up her notes and walked to
the front of the room. she looked around. beth ann was filing her nails, and
mary lou was smiling at alex. ben was busy drawing his cartoons and

it was not the ideal audience.

   phoebe began in a quivering voice. 'for some reason, ben already talked
about my topic, pandora, when he did his report on prometheus.' she
seemed relieved that prometheus came out correctly, and not as porpoises.
'however, ben made a few little mistakes about pandora.

   everyone turned around to stare at ben. 'i did not,' he said.

   'yes you did.'

   mr. birkway said, 'phoebe, if you please ...?'

   'as i was saying,' phoebe continued, 'zeus decided to give man a lovely
present, since man seemed a little lonely down there on earth, with only the
animals to keep him company. so, zeus made a sweet and beautiful woman,
and then he invited all the gods to dinner. it was a very civilized dinner, with
matching plates.'

   mary lou and ben exchanged an eyebrow message.

   'at this civilized dinner, zeus ask

'they gave her all kinds of wonderful things: a fancy shawl, a silver dress,

   ben interrupted. 'i thought you said she was already beautiful.'

   'i know. they gave her more beauty. are you satisfied?' her lip was no
longer trembling. now she was blushing. 'the gods also gave her the ability
to sing, the power of persuasion, a gold crown, flowers and many truly
wonderful things such as that. because of all these gifts, zeus named her
pandora, which means "the gift of all".'


   her heart attack was apparently subsiding. she was getting into it. 'there
were two other gifts

 that i have not mentioned yet. one of them was
curiosity. that is why all women are curious, by the way, because it was a
gift given to the very first woman.

   ben said. 'i wish she had been given the gift of silence.

   'as i was saying,' phoebe continued, 'pandora was given curiosity. ?here
was one more gift, too, and that was a beautiful box, covered in gold and
jewels, but - and this is very important - she was forbidden to open the box.'

   ben said, 'then, why did they give it to her?'

   he was beginning to irritate phoebe, you could tell. she said, 'that's what
i'm telling you. it was a present.

   'but, why did they give her a present that she couldn't open?'

   phoebe looked puzzled. 'i don't know. it's just in the story. as i was
saying, pandora was not supposed to open the box, but because she had been
given ever so much curiosity, she really, really, really wanted to know what
was inside, so one day she opened the box.'

you said she was not supposed to open it.'

   misako raised her hand.

   phoebe sighed. 'do you have a question?'

   'what is in the box?'

   'as i was about to say, before ben interrupted me, inside the box were all
the evils in the world.'

   'what is evils?' shigeru asked.

   'as i was about to explain, inside the box were all the evils of the world
such as hatred, envy, plagues, sickness, cholesterol...

didn't.

really tried when she saw all the horrible things that were coming out of it,
but she could not get it closed in time, and that is why there are all these

   'what was it?' ben asked.

   'what is hope?' shigeru said.

   'hope?' phoebe said. 'hm. hope is... hope. it's hoping that... hmm. hope is
a little hard to explain.'

   phoebe said, 'he drowned.'

   i said, 'it isn't normal to die. it isn't normal. it's terrible.'

   megan said, 'what about heaven? what about god?'

   mary lou said, 'god? is he in this poem?'

   ben said, 'maybe dying could be normal and terrible.'

   when the bell rang, i raced out of the room. phoebe grabbed me. 'come
on,' she said. from her locker, she took the evidence, which she had brought,
from home. and

up the driveway. 1 visualized her opening the door.

   it did not happen.

   while i was thinking about all of this that night after phoebe and i crept
into mrs. cadaver's house, i also thought about ben. i had the sudden urge
to run over to the finneys and ask him where his own mother was, but it was
too late. the finneys would be asleep.

   instead, i lay there thinking of the poem about the traveller, and i could see
the tide rising and falling, and those horrid little white hands snatching the
traveller. how could it be normal, that traveller dying? and how could such
a thing be normal and terrible both at the same time?

   i stayed awake the whole night. i knew that if i closed my eyes,

   as soon as it was daylight, i phoned phoebe. 'phoebe, we've got to find
her.


   'that's what i've been telling you,' she said.


32. the photograph


   the next day was most 'peculible', as mrs. partridge would say.

   phoebe arrived at school with another message, which she had found on
her porch that morning: we never know the worth of water until the well is
dry. 'it's a clue,' phoebe said. 'maybe my mother is hidden in a well.'

   i walked straight into ben when i went to my locker. that grapefruit
aroma was in the air. he looked past me at phoebe, who was going into
class. 'is she going to wear that ratty old sweater every day?' he asked.

   'it's not ratty,' i said. 'it's her mother's speaking of mothers, what i wanted
to say - what i wanted to ask you--' i was trying to find a way to ask about
his own mother, but he interrupted me.

   'you've got something on your face,' he said. he reached up and with soft,
warm fingers he rubbed the side of

went off to class.

   i decided that kissing was thumpingly more complicated than i had ever
imagined. circumstances had to be exactly right in order for the kiss to
occur: both people had to be in the same place at the same time and both
people had to remain still so that the kiss ended up in the right place.
actually, i was relieved that my lips ended up on the cold metal locker. i
could not imagine what had come over me. i could not imagine what might
have happened if the kiss had landed on ben's mouth. it was a shivery thing
to consider.

   i made it through the rest of my classes without losing control of my lips.
the day seemed to be returning to normal - until english class, that is. mr.
birkway came sailing into class carrying our journals i had forgotten all
about them. he was leaping all over the place exclaiming, 'dynamite!

unbelievable! incredible!' he said he couldn't wait to share the journals with
the class.

   mary lou finney said, 'share with the class?'

over to me and said, 'well, i'm not worried. i
wrote a special note in the front of mine distinctly asking him not to read
mine. mine was private.'

   mr. birkway smiled all around the room at each nervous face. 'you needn't
worry,' he said. change any names that you've used, and in case some of you
are nervous about sharing your thoughts and observations, i will fold this
piece of yellow paper over the cover of whichever journal i am reading, so
that you cannot possibly know whose it is.'

   ben asked if he could go to the bathroom. christy said she felt a little sick
and asked if she could go to the nurse. phoebe asked me to touch her
forehead because she was pretty sure she had a fever. mr. birkway looked
all around the room. usually he would let people go to the bathroom or to
the nurse, but this time he said, 'let's not malinger!' he picked up a journal,
slipping the yellow paper over it before anyone had a chance to examine the
cover for clues as to its author's identity. everyone

.

   mr. birkway opened a cupboard, pulled out the journals, slipped the
yellow paper over the cover of one and read:

   this is what i like about jane. [there was no jane, of course. he was
substituting a name.] she is smart, but doesn't act like she knows everything.
she is cute. she smells good. she is cute. she makes laugh. she is cute. she
is friendly. and, did i mention that she is cute?


   while mr. birkway was reading, i got a prickly feeling up and down my
arms. i was wondering if ben had written this about me, but then i realized
that ben didn't even know me when he wrote his journal. a little buzz was
going around the room as people shifted in their seats. christy was smiling,
megan was smiling, beth am was smiling, mary lou was smiling. every in
the room was smiling. each girl thought that this had been written about her.

   i looked carefully at each of the boys. alex was gazing nonchalantly at
mr. birkway, shigeru was asleep in the back row, others were doodling, and
t

hen i saw ben. he was sitting with his hands over his ears, staring down at
his desk. the prickly feeling travelled all the way up to my neck and then
went skipping down my spine. he did write that, but he did not write it about
me.

   mr. birkway exclaimed, 'ah, love, ah, life!' sighing, he pulled out another
journal and read:

   jane doesn't know the first thing about boys. she once asked me what
kisses taste like, so you could tell she hadn't ever kissed anyone. i told her
that they taste like chicken, 
 
 ___________________________
 
and she believed me. she is so dumb sometimes.

   mary lou finney almost jumped straight out of her chair. 'you cabbage
head.' she said to beth ann. 'you beef brain.' beth ann was winding a strand
of hair around and around and around her finger. mary lou stood up. 'i did
not believe you, and i do too know what they taste like, and it isn't chicken.

   mr. birkway looked astonished at this outburst. ben drew a cartoon. it
showed two stick-figures kissing. in the air over their heads was a cartoon
bubble with a chicken inside. the chicken was saying, 'bawk, bawwwk,
bawwwk.'

   mr. birkway turned a few pages in the same journal and read:

   i hate doing this. i hate to write. i hate to read. i hate journals. i especially
hate english where teachers only talk about idiot symbols. i hate that idiot
poem about the snowy woods, and i hate it when people say the woods in
that poem symbolize death o
 
 ___________________________
 
d to admit, you couldn't get more honest than beth ann telling her
english teacher that she hated symbols and english and idiot journals.

   mr. birkway said, 'i used to feel exactly like this.'

   'you did?'

   mr. birkway said, 'i could not understand what all the fuss was about
symbols' he rummaged around in his desk. 'i want to show you something.'
he was pulling papers out and hinging them around. finally, he held up a
picture. 'ah, here it is. dynamite!' he held the picture in front of ben. 'what
is this?' he asked ben.

   ben said, 'it's a vase. obviously.'

   mr. birkway held the drawing in front of beth ann, who looked as if she
might cry. mr. birkway said, 'beth ann, what do you see?' a little tear
dropped down on her cheek. 'it's ok, beth am,' mr. birkway said. 'what do
you see?'

   'i don't see any idiot vase,' she said. 'i see two people. they're looking at
each other.

   'right,' mr. birkway said. 'brave!'


   'i'm right?' beth ann said. 'brave?'

   ben said, 'huh?

 ~o people?' i was thinking the same thing myself what
two people?

   mr. birkway said to ben, 'and you were right, too. brave!' he asked
everyone else, 'how many see a vase?' about half the class raised their
hands 'and how many see two faces?' the rest of the class raised their hands

   then mr. birkway pointed out how you could see both. if you looked only
at the white part in the centre you could clearly see the vase. if you looked
only at the dark parts on the side, you could see two profiles. the curvy
sides of the vase became the outline of the two heads facing each other.

   p

and maybe some people look at this picture
and see only that vase. that's fine, but if some people look at it and see
faces, what is wrong with that? it is faces to that person who is looking at it.
and, what is even more magnificent, you might see both.

   beth ann said, ''two for your money?'

   'isn't it interesting,' mr. birkway said, 'to find both? isn't it interesting to
discover that snowy woods could be death and beauty and even, i suppose,
sex? wow! literature!'

   'did he say sex?' ben said. he copied the drawing into his notebook.

   i thought mr. birkway was finished with the journals for that day, but he
said, 'let me find one or two more selections i'll take one off the bottom. i
haven't read this far yet. i'll choose randomly.' he made a great show of
closing his eyes, and pulling something from near the bottom of the stack.
with his eyes still closed, he slipped the yellow paper over it, but it was too
late. i knew it was mine, because 1 had not written in a blue bookl

 mine was on plain notebook paper. i wanted to die. mr.
birkway read:



she popped the blackberries into her mouth.

then she looked all around-


   i could hardly bear it. i wanted him to stop. he didn't. he read on:


she took two quick steps up to the maple tree

and threw her arms around it, and kissed it soundly.


   people were giggling. oh, how i wanted mr. birkway to stop, but he did
not. he went on:


... i thought i could detect a small dark stain,

as from a blackberry kiss.



   ben looked at me from across the room. after mr. birkway read about my
mother's blackberry kiss, he read about how i kissed the tree and how i have
kissed all different kinds of trees since then and how each tree has a special
taste, all its own, and mixed in with that taste is the taste of blackberries.

   by now, because both ben and phoebe were staring at me, everyone else
stared too. 'she kisses trees?' megan said. i might have died right then and

   mr. birkway stopped. phoebe was sitting quite still, but her eyes blinked
rapidly.

   'go on,' ben said. 'finish!'

   you could tell that mr. birkway was regretting that he had ever started this
business with the journals, but all around the room people were shouting,
'yes, finish!' and so he reluctantly continued.

   i believe she has buried him in her garden; the bell rang. people were
going berserk.

   'wow. a murder. who wrote that?'

   'is it real?'

36. the plan


   all day long we ate up the road through montana. it hadn't looked so far
on the map, but it was all mountains. we started in the foothills of the
rockies as we left yellowstone, and all day we climbed up and down.
sometimes the road snaked along the side of a cliff, and the only thing
between us and the sharp drop was a piddly railing. often, as we sailed
around a bend, we came face to face with a camping trailer swinging its
wide body around the curve.


   'these roads are a pisser,' gramps said, but he was like a little kid riding a
hobby horse. 'gid-yap, let's get a move on,' he said, encouraging the car up a
hill. 'hee- ya,' he said as we swept down the other side.

   i felt as if i was torn in two pieces. half of me was ogling the scenery. i
had to admit that it was as pretty as - maybe even prettier than - bybanks.

se of what she had said about his being a pink jerk, and
mary lou avoided beth ann because of what beth ann had written about

the chicken kisses. megan and christy taunted beth ann with, 'did you
really tell mary lou that kisses taste like chicken? did she really believe
you?' and they taunted me with, 'do you really kiss trees? didn't you know
you're supposed to kiss boys?'

   kisses were on my mind that day for other reasons. they were in the air.

   at lunch, my tray came in contact with ben's mouth. he might have been
aiming a kiss at my hand (a peculible thing for him to do), but he ended up
removing my bread crusts from his cheek and dashing out of the room.

   in english class, everyone badgered mr. birkway to finish reading the
journal entry that he had begun yesterday, the one about mrs. corpse and the
body in the garden, but mr. birkway did not read any more journals instead,
he apologized for hurting people's feelings by reading their private thoughts
aloud, and then he se

   there, ben trailed me for the next half-hour. if i looked at the fiction
section, he was right beside me. if i moved over to examine the magazines,
there he was flipping through one as well. once, his face made con- tact
with my shoulder. he was definitely trying to plant a kiss on me, i knew he
was, but there was nothing i could do about it. i could not help it that
whenever he aimed his mouth in my direction, my body was already moving
away. i needed a little warning.

   i did try remaining completely

still for several consecutive minutes, and
during those minutes, i detected ben leaning slightly toward me several
times. each time, however, he drew back, as if someone were con- trolling
him by an invisible thread.

   across the library, beth ann called. 'sal, there's a spider - oh, sal, kill it!'

   when the final bell rang, phoebe and i were out of school like a shot. at
phoebe's house, we examined the telephone directory. 'we've got to hurry,'
phoebe said, 'before prudence or my father come home.' there were six
pickles listed in the directory. we took turns calling

century. to top it off, sergeant bickle gave me mike's address i was sorely
tempted to end the conversation by informing sergeant bickle that his son
was a potential lunatic, but i refrained. i thanked him and immediately
phoned phoebe.

   'you're brilliant!' she said. 'tomorrow we'll nail mike the lunatic.'


37. the visit


   the next day, saturday, when phoebe and i reached the bus stop, ben was
standing there. 'oh, crud,' phoebe muttered. 'are you waiting for this bus?
are you going to chanting falls?'

   'yup,' he said.


   'to the university?'

   'no.' ben pushed his hair from his eyes and looked up and down the street.
'there's a hospital there. i'm going to see someone.'

   'so you're taking this bus,' phoebe said.

   'yes, free bee, i am taking this bus. do you mind?'

   the three of us sat on the long bench at the back of the bus. i was in
between phoebe and ben, and 
 
 ___________________________
 
his arm pressed up against mine. when ben
asked why we were going to chanting falls, phoebe said we were visiting
an old friend at the university. we rode along with ben's arm pressing up
against mine. each time we rounded a curve, he leaned against me or i
leaned against him. 'sorry,' he said. 'sorry,' i said.

   at chanting falls, we stood on the pavement as the bus roared off. 'the
university is over there...' ben pointed down the road. 'see ya,' and he
walked off in the other direction.

   'oh, lord,' phoebe said. 'oh, lord, why did ben have to be on the same bus?
it made me very nervous.'

   it made me nervous too, but for different reasons. every time i was with
him now, my skin tickled and my brain buzzed and my blood romped
around as if it was percolating.

   the address we had for mike bickle was a freshman dormitory. it was a
three-storey brick building, with hundreds of windows. 'oh, no,' phoe

coming in and out of the building and walking across the lawn. some were
sitting on the grass or benches, studying. in the lobby was a reception desk,
with a handsome young man standing behind it. 'you do it,' phoebe said. 'i
just can't.'

   i felt as if we stood out like sore thumbs. there were all these grown-up
college students and here we were, two puny thirteen-year-old girls. phoebe
said, 'i wish i had worn something else.' she picked lint off her sweater.

   'it's a co-ed dorm,' the young man said. 'girls live here, too. sure, you can
go up. through there...' he gestured.

   we walked through swinging doors phoebe said, 'really, i'm having a
heart attack, i know it. i can't do this let's get out of here.' at the end of the
hall, we slipped out the exit. 'i mean, what if we knocked on his door and he
opened it and pulled us inside and slit our throats?' phoebe said.

   students were milling around on the lawn. i looked for an empty bench on
which we might sit. on the far side of the lawn i saw the backs of two
people, a young man and an older woman. they were holding hands. she
turned to him and kissed his cheek.

   'phoebe-' on the bench was phoebe's mother, and she was kissing the
lunatic.


38. a kiss


   phoebe was stunned and angry, but she was braver than i was. she could
watch, but i could not. i started running. i assumed that phoebe would flee
too, but i didn't look back. i tore down the street, trying to remember

impulse. a hunch. i asked the receptionist if i
could see mrs. finney. she flipped through a roster. 'are you a family
member?' she said.

   'no.'


   'i'm afraid you can't go up then,' she said. 'mrs. finney is on the
psychiatric ward. it says "family only" on this list.'

   'i was looking for her son. he came here to visit her.

   'maybe they went outside. you could look out back.'

   behind the hospital was a wide, sloping lawn, bordered by flower gardens
scattered across the lawn were benches and chairs, most of them occupied
with patients and their visitors it was a scene much like the one i had just
left at the university, except here no one was studying, and some of the
people wore dressing gowns

   ben was sitting cross-legged on the ground in front of a woman in a pink
robe. she fidgeted with the sash. ben saw me and stood up as i crossed the
lawn. 'this is my mother,' he said. she did not look up. 'mom. this is
salamanca.' she plucked at her sash. i said hello, but she di

ben and i followed.

   she reminded me so much of my mother after she returned from the
hospital. my mother would stop right in the middle of doing something
inside the house and walk out the door. halfway up the hill, she would sit
down to catch her breath. she picked at the grass, got up again, and went a
little further. sometimes my mother went in the barn and filled the pail with
chicken feed, but before she reached the chicken coop, she set the pail down
and moved off in another direction. wh

en she could walk farther, my mother
rambled over the fields and meadows, in a weaving, snaking pattern, as if
she could not quite make up her mind which way to turn.

   we followed ben's mother back and forth across the lawn, but she never
seemed to notice our presence. at last, i said i had to go, and that's when it
happened.

   for one quick moment we both had the same agenda. i looked at him and
he looked at me. both of our heads moved forward. it must have been in
slow motion, because i had a split second there to be reminded of mr.
birkway's drawing of the two heads facing each other, with the vase in
between. i wondered briefly, just for an instant, if a vase could fit

 between
us


   if there had been a vase, we would have squashed it, because our heads
moved completely together and our lips landed in the right place, which was
on the other person's lips. it was a real kiss, and it did not taste like chicken.

   and then our heads moved slowly backward and we stared out across the
lawn, and i felt like the newly born horse who knows nothing but feels
everything.

   ben touched his lips 'did it taste a little like black- berries to you?' he said.

   at this point in my story, gram interrupted. 'oh, yes, yes, yes!' she said.
'i've been waiting for that kiss for days i do like a story with some good

   'she's such a gooseberry,' gramps said.

   we were churning through montana. i didn't dare check our progress on
the map. i didn't want to discover that we couldn't make it in time. i thought
that if i kept talking, and praying underneath,

 and if we kept moving along
those mountainous roads, we had a chance.

   gram said, 'but, what about peeby? what about her mother kissing the
lunatic? i didn't like that kiss very much. it was the other one i liked - the
one with ben.

   when i left the hospital, i debated retracing my steps and returning to the
university in search of phoebe. i decided to find the bus stop first and then
see if i was feeling brave enough to go on, but when i did reach the bus stop,
there was phoebe, sitting on the bench.

   'well?' i said. 'what happened?'

   'where were you?'

   i did not tell her about seeing ben or his mother. i wanted to, but i
couldn't. 'i was afraid, phoebe. i couldn't stay there.


   'and i thought you were th

matter. nothing matters. i'm sick of it.'

   'what happened?'

   'nothing. they sat there on the bench having a gay old time. if i could toss
rocks like you can toss rocks, i'd have plonked them both in the back of the
head. did you notice her hair? she's cut it. it's short. and do you know what
my mother did? in the middle of talking, she leaned over and spit on the
grass. spit! it was disgusting. and the lunatic, do you know what he did
when she spit? he laughed. then he leaned over and he spit.'

   'why would they do that?'

   'who knows? i'm sick of it. my mother can stay there for all i

doesn't need me. she doesn't need any of us.'

   phoebe was like that all the way home on the bus. she was in an
extensively black mood. i did not tell her about ben. we got back to
phoebe's house just as her father pulled in the driveway. prudence rushed
out of the house saying, 'she called, she called, she called!'

   'who called?' mr. winterbottom said.

   prudence was beside herself. 'mom, of course. just ten minutes ago. she's
coming home.'

   'terrific,' phoebe muttered.

   'what was that, phoebe?' her father said.

   'nothing.'

   'she's coming tomorrow,' prudence said. 'but--'

   'what's wrong?' her father said. 'what else did she say?'

ts. i doubt if i ever could explain why that
was, but for some reason it seemed the perfect thing to do, and when phoebe
turned around and went into the house, i knew that that was the right thing
for her to do, too.

   with the courage of that spit in me, i went to see margaret cadaver, arid
we had a long talk and that's when i found out how she met my father. it was
painful to talk with her, and i even cried in front of her, but afterwards i
understood why my father liked to be with her.

   ben was sitting on my front steps when i got home. i was extensively glad
to see him. he said, 'i brought you something. it's out back.' he led me
around the side of the house and there, strutting across that little patch of
grass, was a chicken. i was never in my life so happy to see a chicken.

   ben said, 'i named it, but you can change the name if you want.' when i
asked him what its name was, he leaned forward and i leaned forward and
another kiss happened, a spectacular kiss, an extensively

perfect kiss, and
ben said, 'its name is blackberry'


   'oh,' gram said, 'is that the end of the peeby story?'

   'yes' i said. that wasn't quite true, i suppose, as i could have told more. i
could have told about phoebe getting adjusted to having a brother, and
phoebe getting adjusted to her 'new' mother, and ail of that, but that part was
still going on, even as we travelled through the mountains. it was a whole
different story.

   'well, i liked that story about peeby, and i'm glad it wasn't too awfully sad,

 was one thing i had been
looking for.

   'a bus went off the road here - a year or more ago,' he said. 'skidded right
there, coming out of that last turn, and went sliding into this here overlook
and on through the railing and rolled over and over into those trees. a
helluva thing. when i came home that night, rescuers were still hacking their
way through the brush to get to it. only one person survived, ya know?'

   i knew.


43. the bus and the willow


   when the map drove off, i crawled beneath the railing and made my way
down the hill toward the bus in the east the sky was smokey gray, and i was
glad for the approaching dawn. in the year and a half since the trail was
hacked out, the brush had begun to grow back. wet with dew, straggly
branches slapped and scratched at my legs and hid uneven ground so that
several times i tripped, tumbling and sliding downwards

   the bus lay on its side like an old sick horse, its broken headlights staring
out mournfully into the surrounding tr
 
 ___________________________
 
like a sardine tin. through a smashed window behind the driver's seat, i

could see jumbled mess of twisted seats and chunks of foam rubber.
everything was dusted over with fuzzy, green mould.

   i had imagined that i would drop through a window and walk down the
aisle, but there was no space inside to move. i had wanted to scour every
inch of the bus, looking for something - anything - that might be familiar. i
climbed back down off the bus and walked all the way around it. sticking
out from beneath the side of the bus was a man's boot, an open gash in the
side of it revealing that, thankfully, there was no foot inside it.

   by now the sky was pale pink, and it was easier to find the uphill trail, but
harder going as it was a steep incline. by the time i reached the top, i was
muddy and scratched from head to toe. it wasn't until i had crawled beneath
the railing that i noticed the car parked behind gramps' red chevrolet.

   it was the sheriff. he was talking on his radio when he sa

e, and went inside. behind us was the deputy
in gramps' car. the caretaker came out and pointed off to the right, and the
sheriff got back in the car and drove off in that direction.

   it was a pleasant place. the snake river curved behind this section, and
tall, full-leaved trees grew here and there across the lawn. the sheriff
parked the car and led me up a path toward the river, and there, on a little
hill overlooking the river and the valley, was my mother's grave.


   on the tombstone, beneath her name and the dates of her birth and death,
was an engraving of a maple tree, and it was only then, when i saw the stone
and her name - chanhassen 'sugar' pickford hiddle - and the engraving of
the tree, that i knew, by myself and for myself, that she was not coming
back. i asked if i could sit there for a little while, because i wanted to
memorize the place. i wanted to memorize the grass and the trees, the smells
and the sounds

expected that i would see her walking through a field and i would call to her
and she would say 'oh, salamanca, my left arm,' and 'oh, salamanca, take
me home.'

   i slept for the last fifty miles into coeur d'alene and when i awoke, i was
sitting in the sheriff's car outside the hospital entrance. the sheriff was
coming out of the hospital he handed me an envelope and slid in beside me
on the seat.

   in the envelope was a note from gramps giving the name of the motel he
was staying at. beneath that he had written, 'i am sorry to say that our
gooseberry died at three o'clock this morning.'

   gramps was sitting on the side of the bed in the motel, talking on the
telephone. when he saw me and the sheriff at the door, he put the phone
down and hugged me to him. the sheriff told gramps how sorry he was and
that he didn't think it was the time or place to give anybody a lecture about
underage grand- daughters driving down a mountainside in the middle of the
night. he handed gramps hi

ps' new beagle puppy, which he
named huzza huzza. gramps pets the puppy and smokes his pipe as i drive,
and we both play the moccasin game. it is a game we made up on our way
back from idaho. we take turns pretending we are walking in someone else's
moccasins

   'if i was walking in peeby's moccasins, i would be jealous of a new brother
dropping out of the sky.'

   'if i was in gram's moccasins right this minute, i would want to cool my
feet in that river over there.'

   'if i was walking in ben's moccasins, 1 would miss salamanca hiddle.'

   on and on we go. we walk in everybody's moccasins, and we have
discovered some interesting things that way. one day i realized that our
whole trip out to lewiston had been a gift from gram and gramps to me.
they were giving me a chance to walk in my mother's moccasins - to see
what she had seen and feel what she might have felt on her last trip.

   and, another afternoon, after we had been talking about prometheus

s a relief to discover that although
there might be axe murderers and kidnappers in the world, most people seem
a lot like us: sometimes afraid and sometimes brave, sometimes cruel and
sometimes kind.

   i decided that bravery is looking pandora's box full in the eye as best you
can, and then turning to the other box, the one with the smooth beautiful
folds inside: momma kissing trees, my gram saying, 'huzza, huzza,' gramps
and his marriage bed.

   my mother's postcards and her hair are still beneath the floorboards in my
room. i re-read all the postcards when i came home. gram and gramps and i
had been to every place my mother had. there are the black hills, mount
rushmore, the badlands - the only card that is still hard for me to read is the
one from coeur d'alene, the one that i received two days after she died.

   when i drive gramps around in his truck, i also tell him all the stories my
mother told me. his favourite is a navaho one about estsanatlehi. she's a
woman who never dies

. she grows from baby to mother to old woman and
then turns into a baby again, and on and on she goes, living a thousand,
thousand lives. gramps likes this, and so do i.

   i still climb the sugar maple tree and i have heard the singing tree sing.
the sugar maple tree is my thinking place. yesterday in the sugar maple, i
realized that i was jealous of three things

   the first jealousy is a foolish one. i am jealous of whomever ben wrote
about in his journal, because it was not me.

   the second jealousy is this: i am jealous that my mother had wanted more
children. wasn't i enough? when i walk in her moccasins, though, i say, 'if i

were my mother, i might want more children - not because i don't love my
salamanca, but because i love her so much. i want more of these.' maybe
that is a fish in the air and maybe it isn't, but it is what i want to believe.

   the last jealousy is not foolish, nor is it one that will go a

way just yet. i
am still jealous that phoebe's mother came back and mine did not.

   i miss my mother.

   ben and phoebe write to me all the time. ben sent me a valentine in the
middle of october that said,


roses are red
dirt is brown,

please be my valentine,

or else i'll frown.


   there was a p. s. added: i've never written poetry before.

   i sent a valentine back that said:



dry is the desert,
wet is the rain,
your love for me

is not in vain.


   i added a p.s. that said, i've never written any poetry either.

   ben and phoebe and mrs. cadaver and mrs. partridge are all coming to
visit next month. there is a chance that mr. bir

kway might come as well,
but phoebe hopes not, as she does not think she could stand to be in a car for
that long with a teacher. my father and i have been scrubbing the house for
their visit. i can't wait to show phoebe and ben the swimming hole and the
fields, the hayloft and the trees, and the cows and the chickens blackberry,
the chicken that ben gave me, is queen of the coop, and i'll show ben her,
too. i am hoping, also, for some blackberry kisses between me and ben.

   but, for now, cramps has his beagle, and i have a chicken and a singing
tree, and that's the way it is. huzza, huzza.
