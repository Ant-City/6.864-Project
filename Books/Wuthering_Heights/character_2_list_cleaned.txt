[CHARACTER] - 
                 well-bred
but rather spoiled as a boy, [CHARACTER] grows into a tender, constant,
but cowardly man. he is almost the ideal gentleman: catherine accurately describes
him as "handsome," "pleasant to be with," "cheerful," and "rich."
however, this full assortment of gentlemanly characteristics, along
with his civilized virtues, proves useless in edgar's clashes with
his foil, heathcliff, who gains power over his wife, sister, 
and daughter.
