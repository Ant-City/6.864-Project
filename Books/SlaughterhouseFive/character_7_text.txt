 south africans, new zealanders, australians,
thousands of us about to stop being prisoners of war.
 and on the other side of the field were thousands of russians and poles and
yugoslavians and so on guarded by american soldiers. an exchange was made there in
the rain-one for one. o'hare and i climbed into the back of an american truck with a lot
of others. o'hare didn't have any souvenirs. almost everybody else did. i had a
ceremonial luftwaffe saber, still do. the rabid little american i call paul lazzaro in this
book had about a quart of diamonds and emeralds and rubies and so on' he had taken
these from dead people in the cellars of dresden.' so it goes.
 an idiotic englishman, who had lost all his teeth somewhere had his souvenir in a
canvas bag. the bag was resting on my insteps. he would peek into the bag every now
and then, and he would roll his eyes and swivel his scrawny neck,, trying to catch people
looking covetously at his bag. and he would bounce the bag on my insteps.

ad pulled political wires to get into the army at his age. the subject he had
taught in indianapolis was contemporary problems in western civilization. he also
coached the tennis team, and took very good care of his body.
 derby's son would survive the war. derby wouldn't. that good body of his would be
filled with holes by a firing squad in dresden in sixty-eight days. so it goes.
 the worst american body wasn't billy's. the worst body belonged to a car thief from
cicero, illinois. ms name was paul lazzaro. he was tiny, and not only were his bones
and teeth rotten, but his skin was disgusting. lazzaro was polka-dotted all over with
dime-sized scars. he had had many plagues of boils.
 lazzaro, too, had been on roland weary's boxcar, and had given his word of honor to
weary that he would find some way to make billy pilgrim pay for weary's death. he was
looking around now, wondering which naked human being was billy.
 the naked americans took their places under many showerheads along a white-tiled

 it in two with his bare hands. in case billy died, which he didn't, half the tag
would mark his body and half would mark his grave.
 after poor edgar derby, the high school teacher, was shot in dresden later on, a doctor
pronounced him dead and snapped his dogtag in two. so it goes.
 properly enrolled and tagged, the americans were led through gate after gate again. in
two days' time now their families would learn from the international red cross that they
were alive.
 next to billy was little paul lazzaro, who had promised to avenge roland weary.
lazzaro wasn't thinking about vengeance. he was thinking about his terrible bellyache.
his stomach had shrunk to the size of a walnut. that dry, shriveled pouch was as sore as
a boil.
 next to lazzaro was poor, doomed old edgar derby, with his american and german
dogs displayed like a necklace, on the outside of his clothes. he had expected to become
a captain, a company commander, because of his wisdom and age. now here he was on

legs splayed toward
the entrance of the busy dining car.
 the porter woke him up when the train reached ilium. billy staggered off with his
duffel bag, and then he stood on the station platform next to the porter, trying to wake up.
 'have a good nap, did you?' said the porter.
 'yes,' said billy.
 'man,' said the porter, 'you sure had a hard-on.'
 at three in the morning on bill's morphine night in prison, a new patient was carried
into the hospital by two lusty englishmen. he was tiny. he was paul lazzaro, the polkadotted
car thief from cicero, illinois. he had been caught stealing cigarettes from under
the pillow of an englishman. the englishman, half asleep, had broken lazzaro's right
arm and knocked him unconscious.
 the englishman who had done this was helping to carry lazzaro in now. he had fiery
red hair and no eyebrows. he had been cinderella's blue fairy godmother in the play.
now he supported his half of lazzaro with one hand while he closed the door behind
himself with the other. 'does

listen:
 billy pilgrim says he went to dresden germany, on the day after his morphine night in
the british compound in the center of the extermination camp for russian prisoners of
war. billy woke up at dawn on that day in january. there were no windows in the little
hospital, and the ghostly candles had gone out. so the only light came from pin-prick
holes in the walls, and from a sketchy rectangle that outlined the imperfectly fitted door.
little paul lazzaro, with a broken arm, snored on one bed. edgar derby, the high school
teacher who would eventually he shot, snored on another.
 billy sat up in bed. he had no idea what year it was or what planet he was on.
whatever the planet's name was, it was cold. but it wasn't the cold that had awakened
billy. it was animal magnetism which was making him shiver and itch. it gave him
profound aches in his musculature, as though he had been exercising hard.
 the animal magnetism was coming from behind him. if

g man,' said derby, who, of course, was a pretty big man himself.
 'size don't mean a thing.'
 'you're going to shoot him?'
 'i'm gonna have him shot,' said lazzaro. 'he'll get home after the war. he'll be a big
hero. the dames'll be climbing all over him. he'll settle down. a couple of years'll go by.
and then one day there'll be a knock on his door. he'll answer the door, and there'll be a
stranger out there. the stranger'll ask him if he's so-and-so. when he says he is, the
stranger'll say, "paul lazzaro sent me." and he'll pull out a gun and shoot his pecker off.
the stranger'll let him think a couple of seconds about who paul lazzaro is and what
life's gonna be like without a pecker. then he'll shoot him once in the guts and walk
away.' so it goes.
 lazzaro said that he could have anybody in the world killed for a thousand dollars plus
traveling expenses. he had a list in his head, he said.
 derby asked him who all was on the list, and lazzaro said, 'just make fucking sure you
don't get on it

g experience in dealing with people. there were no
further nominations, so the nominations were closed.
 'all in favor?'
 two or three people said, 'aye.'
 then poor old derby made a speech. he thanked the englishman for his good advice,
said he meant to follow it exactly. he said he was sure that all the other americans would
do the mm. he said that his primary responsibility now was to make damn well sure that
everybody got home safely.
 'go take a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut,' murmured paul lazzaro in his azure nest.
'go take a flying fuck at the moon.'
 the temperature climbed startlingly that day. the noontime was balmy. the germans
brought soup and bread in two-wheeled carts which were pulled by russians. the
englishmen sent over real coffee and sugar and marmalade and cigarettes and cigars, and
the doors of the theater were left open, so the warmth could get in.
 the americans began to feel much better. they were able to hold their food. and then
it was time to go to dresden. the amer

ng their wards. they
knew what sick and foolish soldiers they themselves appeared to be. one of them actually
had an artificial leg, and carried not only a loaded rifle but a cane. still they were
expected to earn obedience and respect from tall cocky, murderous american
infantrymen who had just come from all the killing of the front.
 and then they saw bearded billy pilgrim in his blue toga and silver shoes, with his
hands in a muff. he looked at least sixty years old. next to billy was little paul lazzaro
with a broken arm. he was fizzing with rabies. next to lazzaro was the poor old high
school teacher, edgar derby, mournfully pregnant with patriotism and middle age and
imaginary wisdom. and so on.
 the eight ridiculous dresdeners ascertained that these hundred ridiculous creatures
really were american fighting men fresh from the front. they smiled, and then they
laughed. their terror evaporated. there was nothing to be afraid of. here were more
crippled human beings, more fools like themselves
