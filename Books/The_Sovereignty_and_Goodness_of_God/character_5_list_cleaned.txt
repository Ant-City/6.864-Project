[CHARACTER] - 
the unstable, unreliable leader of the wampanoag indians. at times,
[CHARACTER] reassures rowlandson that she'll soon be free. but when her
redemption is near, he tries to bypass the structure of the council, refusing to
meet with the rest of the indians in their general court and promising
rowlandson her freedom in exchange for food and goods. philip may be unreliable,
but he is not unkind, and the ambivalence of rowlandson's attitude toward philip
suggests the larger uncertainty rowlandson has about her captors' savageness and
her own civilized nature.
