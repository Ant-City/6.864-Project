new. his face was as familiar to her as if she had known him au her life but she could not recall who he was. he moved away from the car and began to come down the embankment, placing his feet carefully so that he wouldn't slip. he had on tan and white shoes and no socks, and his ankles were red and thin. "good afternoon," he said. "i see you all had you a little spill."

"we turned over twice!" said the grandmother.

"once"," he corrected. "we seen it happen. try their car and see will it run, hiram," he said quietly to the boy with the gray hat.

"what you got that gun for?" john wesley asked. "whatcha gonna do with that gun?"

"lady," the man said to the children's mother, "would you mind calling them children to sit down by you? children make me nervous. i want all you all to sit down right together there where you're at."

"what are you telling us what to do for?" june star asked.

behind them the line of woods gaped like a dark open mouth. "come here," said their mother.

"hush!" bailey yelled. "hush! everybody shut up and let me handle this!" he was squatting in the position of a runner about to sprint forward but he didn't move.

"i prechate that, lady," the misfit said and drew a little circle in the ground with the butt of his gun.

"it'll take a half a hour to fix this here car," hiram called, looking over the raised hood of it.

"well, first you and bobby lee get him and that little boy to step over yonder with you," the misfit said, pointing to bailey and john wesley. "the boys want to ast you some- thing," he said to bailey. "would you mind stepping back in them woods there with them?"

"listen," bailey began, "we're in a terrible predicament! nobody realizes what this is," and his voice cracked. his eyes were as blue and intense as the parrots in his shirt and he remained

 perfectly still.

the grandmother reached up to adjust her hat brim as if she were going to the woods with him but it came off in her hand. she stood staring at it and after a second she let it fall on the ground. hiram pulled bailey up by the arm as if he were assisting an old man. john wesley caught hold of his father's hand and bobby lee followed. they went off toward the woods and just as they reached the dark edge, bailey turned and supporting himself against a gray naked pine trunk, he shouted, "i'll be back in a minute, mamma, wait on me!"

"come back this instant!" his mother shrilled but they all disappeared into the woods.

"bailey boy!" the grandmother called in a tragic voice but she found she was

"if you would pray," the old lady said, "jesus would help you."

"that's right," the misfit said.

"well then, why don't you pray?" she asked trembling with delight suddenly.

"i don't want no hep," he said. "i'm doing all right by myself."

bobby lee and hiram came ambling back from the woods. bobby lee was dragging a yellow shirt with bright blue parrots in it.

"thow me that shirt, bobby lee," the misfit said. the shirt came flying at him and landed on his shoulder and he put it on. the grandmother couldn't name what the shirt reminded her of. "no, lady," the misfit said while he was buttoning it up, "i found out the crime don't matter. you can do one thing or you can do another, kill a man or take a tire off his car, because sooner or later you're

the children's mother had begun to make heaving noises as if she couldn't get her breath. "lady," he asked, "would you and that little girl like to step off yonder with bobby lee and hiram and join your husband?"

"yes, thank you," the mother said faintly. her left arm dangled helplessly and she was holding the baby, who had gone to sleep, in the other. "hep that lady up, hiram," the misfit said as she struggled to climb out of the ditch, "and bobby lee, you hold onto that little girl's hand."

"i don't want to hold hands with him," june star said. "he reminds me of a pig."

the fat boy blushed and laughed and caught her by the arm and pulled her off into the woods after hiram and her mother.

alone with the misfit, the grandmother found that she had lost her voice. there was not a cloud in the sky nor any sun. there was nothing around her but woods. she wanted to tel

ouldn't be like i am now." his voice seemed about to crack and the grandmother's head cleared for an instant. she saw the man's face twisted close to her own as if he were going to cry and she murmured, "why you're one of my babies. you're one of my own children!" she reached out and touched him on the shoulder. the misfit sprang back as if a snake had bitten him and shot her three times through the chest. then he put his gun down on the ground and took off his glasses and began to clean them.

hiram and bobby lee returned from the woods and stood over the ditch, looking down at the grandmother who half sat and half lay in a puddle of blood with her legs crossed under her like a child's and her face smiling up at the cloudless sky.

without his glasses, the misfit's eyes were red-rimmed and pale and defenseless-looking. "take her off and thow her where you shown the others," he said, picking up the cat that was rubbing itself against his leg.

"she was a talk
