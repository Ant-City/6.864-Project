noble disdain for
mean tranquillity; and chaucer, on the whole a man of peaceful
avocations, was penetrated to the depth of his consciousness
with the lofty and lovely civil side of that brilliant and restless
military period. no record of his youthful years, however,
remains to us; if we believe that at the age of eighteen he was a
student of cambridge, it is only on the strength of a reference in
his "court of love", where the narrator is made to say that his
name is philogenet, "of cambridge clerk;" while he had  already
told us that when he was stirred to seek the court of cupid he
was "at eighteen year of age." according to leland, however,
he was educated at oxford, proceeding thence to france and
the netherlands, to finish his studies; but there remains no
certain evidence of his having belonged to either university. at
the same time, it is not doubted that his family was of good
condition; and, whether or not we accept the assertion that his
father held the rank of knighthood -- rej

nce the author has quoted.
when we consider the poet's high place in literature and at
court, which could not fail to make him free of the hospitalities
of the brilliant little lombard states; his familiarity with the
tongue and the works of italy's greatest bards, dead and living;
the reverential regard which he paid to the memory of great
poets, of which we have examples in "the house of fame," and
at the close of "troilus and cressida" <4>; along with his own
testimony in the prologue to the clerk's tale, we cannot fail to
construe that testimony as a declaration that the tale was
actually told to chaucer by the lips of petrarch, in 1373, the
very year in which petrarch translated it into latin, from
boccaccio's "decameron."<5>   mr bell notes the objection to
this interpretation, that the words are put into the mouth, not of
the poet, but of the clerk; and meets it by the counter-
objection, that the clerk, being a purely imaginary personage,
could not have learned the story at padua fr

two lines:

"i say not this by wives that be wise,
but if it be when they them misadvise."

and again, in the prologue to the "legend of good women,"
from a description of the daisy --

"she is the clearness and the very light,
that in this darke world me guides and leads,"

the poet, in the very next lines, slides into an address to his lady:

"the heart within my sorrowful heart you dreads
and loves so sore, that ye be, verily,
the mistress of my wit, and nothing i," &c.

when, therefore, the clerk of oxford is made to say that he will
tell a tale --

                          "the which that i
learn'd at padova of a worthy clerk,
as proved by his wordes and his werk.
he is now dead, and nailed in his chest,
i pray to god to give his soul good rest.

we may without violent effort believe

 that chaucer speaks in his
own person, though dramatically the words are on the clerk's
lips.  and the belief is not impaired by the sorrowful way in
which the clerk lingers on petrarch's death -- which would be
less intelligible if the fictitious narrator had only read the story
in the latin translation, than if we suppose the news of
petrarch's death at arqua in july 1374 to have closely followed
chaucer to england, and to have cruelly and irresistibly mingled
itself with our poet's personal recollections of his great italian
contemporary.  nor must we regard as without significance the
manner in which the clerk is made to distinguish between the
"body" o

or, on the 1st of may 1388, less than a year and a half
after being dismissed from the customs, he was constrained to
assign his pensions, by surrender in chancery, to one john
scalby.  in may 1389, richard ii., now of age, abruptly
resumed the reins of government, which, for more than two
years, had been ably but cruelly managed by gloucester. the
friends of lancaster were once more supreme in the royal
councils, and chaucer speedily profited by the change. on the
12th of july he was appointed clerk of the king's works at the
palace of westminster, the tower, the royal manors of
kennington, eltham, clarendon, sheen, byfleet, childern
langley, and feckenham, the castle of berkhamstead, the royal
lodge of hathenburgh in the new forest, the lodges in the
parks of clarendon, childern langley, and feckenham, and the
mews for the king's falcons at charing cross; he received a
salary of two shillings per day, and was allowed to perform the
duties by deputy. for some reason unknown, chaucer held t

rue "dream
of chaucer," in which he celebrates the marriage of his patron,
was published for the first time by speght in 1597. john of
gaunt, in the end of 1371, married his second wife, constance,
daughter to pedro the cruel of spain; so that "the book of the
duchess" must have been written between 1369 and 1371.

4. where he bids his "little book"
"subject be unto all poesy,
and kiss the steps, where as thou seest space,
of virgil, ovid, homer, lucan, stace."

5. see note 1 to the tale in the clerk's tale.

6. see note 1 to the man of law's tale.

7. "written," says mr wright, "in the sixteenth year of the reign
of richard ii. (1392-1393);" a powerful confirmation of the
opinion that this poem was really produced in chaucer's mature
age. see the introductory notes to it and to the legend of good
women.

8. the old biographers of chaucer, founding on what they took
to be autobiographic allusions in "the testament of love,"
assign to him between 1354 and 1389 a very different history

nings of john of gaunt. chaucer's department in the london
customs was in those days one of the most important and
lucrative in the kingdom; and if mercenary abuse of his post
could have been proved, we may be sure that his and his
patron's enemies would not have been content with simple
dismissal, but would have heavily amerced or imprisoned him.

10. the salary was l36, 10s. per annum; the salary of the chief
judges was l40, of the puisne judges about l27. probably the
judges -- certainly the clerk of the works -- had fees or
perquisites besides the stated payment.

11. chaucer's patron had died earlier in 1399, during the exile
of his son (then duke of hereford) in france. the duchess
constance had died in 1394; and the duke had made reparation
to katherine swynford -- who had already borne him four
children -- by marrying her in 1396, with the approval of
richard ii., who legitimated the children, and made the eldest
son of the poet's sister-in-law earl of somerset. from this long-

notes to the clerk's tale


1. petrarch, in his latin romance, "de obedientia et fide uxoria
mythologia," (of obedient and faithful wives in mythology)
translated the charming story of "the patient grizel" from the
italian of bocaccio's "decameron;" and chaucer has closely
followed petrarch's translation, made in 1373, the year before
that in which he died.  the fact that the embassy to genoa, on
which chaucer was sent, took place in 1372-73, has lent
countenance to the opinion that the english poet did actually

since ye so muche knowen of that art,
full heartily i pray you tell us part."
"gladly," quoth he; "but of mine owen sore,
for sorry heart, i telle may no more."


notes to the prologue to the merchant's tale


1.  though the manner in which the merchant takes up the
closing words of the envoy to the clerk's tale, and refers to
the patience of griselda, seems to prove beyond doubt that
the order of the tales in the text is the right one, yet in
some manuscripts of good authority the franklin's tale
follows the clerk's, and the envoy is concluded by this
stanza: --
"this worthy clerk when ended was his tale,
our hoste said, and swore by cocke's bones
'me lever were than a barrel of ale
my wife at home had heard this legend once;
this is a gentle tale for the nonce;
as, to my purpose, wiste ye my w

ill.
but thing that will not be, let it be still.'"

in other manuscripts of less authority the host proceeds, in
two similar stanzas, to impose a tale on the franklin; but
tyrwhitt is probably right in setting them aside as spurious,
and in admitting the genuineness of the first only, if it be
supposed that chaucer forgot to cancel it when he had
decided on another mode of connecting the merchant's with
the clerk's tale.

notes to the doctor's tale


1. livy, book iii. cap. 44, et seqq.

2. faconde: utterance, speech; from latin, "facundia,"
eloquence.

3. slothe: other readings are "thought" and "youth."

4. meschance: wickedness; french, "mechancete."

5. this line seems to be a kind of aside thrown in by chaucer
himself.

6. the various readings of this word are "churl," or "cherl," in
the best manuscripts; "client" in the common editions, and
"clerk" supported by two important manuscripts. "client"
would perhaps be the best reading, if it were not awkward for
the metre; but between "churl" and ''clerk" there can be little
doubt that mr wright chose wisely when he preferred the
second.

7. judges xi. 37, 38.  "and she said unto her father,
let .  . . me alone two months, that i may go up and down upon
the mountains, and bewail my virginity, i and my fellows.  and
he said, go."

is marked by an elegance, care, and finish very different from
the bold freedom which in so great measure distinguishes the
canterbury tales; and the fact is easily explained when we
remember that, in the earlier poem, chaucer followed a beaten
path, in which he had many predecessors and competitors, all
seeking to sound the praises of love with the grace, the
ingenuity, and studious devotion, appropriate to the theme. the
story of the poem is exceedingly simple. under the name of
philogenet, a clerk or scholar of cambridge, the poet relates
that, summoned by mercury to the court of love, he journeys
to the splendid castle where the king and queen of love,
admetus and alcestis, keep their state. discovering among the
courtiers a friend named philobone, a chamberwoman to the
queen, philogenet is led by her into a circular temple, where, in
a tabernacle, sits venus, with cupid by her side. while he is
surveying the motley crowd of suitors to the goddess,
philogenet is summoned back into the k

ilogenet presented to her his
petition for love, which she heard with some haughtiness; she
was not, she said, well acquainted with him, she did not know
where he dwelt, nor his name and condition. he informed her
that "in art of love he writes," and makes songs that may be
sung in honour of the king and queen of love. as for his name
--

"my name? alas, my heart, why mak'st thou strange?*         *why so cold
philogenet i call'd am far and near,                        or distant?*

from you, that with your heav'nly streames* clear        *beams, glances
ravish my heart; and ghost, and all in fere:*              *all together
since at the first i writ my bill* for grace,                  *petition
me thinks i see some mercy in your face;"

and again he humbly pressed his suit. but the lady disdained the
idea that, "for a word of sugar'd eloquence," she should have
compassion in so little space; "there come but few who speede
here so soon." if, a

he might sue and serve, and wax pale, and green, and dead,
without murmuring in any wise; but whereas he desired her
hastily to lean to love, he was unwise, and must cease that

might not obtain their mistresses' favour; therefore she

poems.

2. born: burnish, polish: the poet means, that his verses do not
display the eloquence or brilliancy of cicero in setting forth his
subject-matter.

3. galfrid: geoffrey de vinsauf to whose treatise on poetical
composition a less flattering allusion is made in the nun's
priest's tale. see note 33 to that tale.

4. stirp: race, stock; latin, "stirps."

5. calliope is the epic muse -- "sister" to the other eight.

6. melpomene was the tragic muse.

7. the same is said of griselda, in the clerk's tale; though she
was of tender years, "yet in the breast of her virginity there was
inclos'd a sad and ripe corage"

8. the confusion which chaucer makes between cithaeron and
cythera, has already been remarked.  see note 41 to the
knight's tale.

9. balais: bastard rubies; said to be so called from balassa, the
asian country where they were found. turkeis: turquoise
stones.

of the sad distress into which phoebus was plunged by

 that she may have a year's respite. nature grants the
prayer, pronounces judgment accordingly, and dismisses the
assembly; and after a chosen choir has sung a roundel in honour
of the goddess, all the birds fly away, and the poet awakes. it is
probable that chaucer derived the idea of the poem from a
french source; mr bell gives the outline of a fabliau, of which
three versions existed, and in which a contention between two
ladies regarding the merits of their respective lovers, a knight
and a clerk, is decided by cupid in a court composed of birds,
which assume their sides according to their different natures.
whatever the source of the idea, its management, and the whole
workmanship of the poem, especially in the more humorous
passages, are essentially chaucer's own.]

1. rood: the cross on which christ was crucified; anglo-saxon,
"rode."

2. well worth of this thing greate clerks: great scholars set
much worth upon this thing --  that is, devote much labour,
attach much importance, to the subject of dreams.

3. the poet briefly refers to the description of the house of
somnus, in ovid's "metamorphoses," 1. xi. 592, et seqq.; where
the cave of somnus is said to be "prope cimmerios," ("near the
cimmerians") and "saxo tamen exit ab imo rivus aquae
lethes." ("a stream of lethe's water issues from the base of the
rock")
