... at some point something must have come from nothing ...
sophie amundsen was on her way home from school. she had walked the first part of
the way with joanna. they had been discussing robots. joanna thought the human
brain was like an advanced computer. sophie was not certain she agreed. surely a
person was more than a piece of hardware?
when they got to the supermarket they went their separate ways. sophie lived on the
outskirts of a sprawling suburb and had almost twice as far to school as joanna. there
were no other houses beyond her garden, which made it seem as if her house lay at the
end of the world. this was where the woods began.

things. why couldn't they talk about what a human being
is--or about what the world is and how it came into being?
for the first time she began to feel that at school as well as everywhere else people
were only concerned with trivialities. there were major problems that needed to be
solved.
did anybody have answers to these questions? sophie felt that thinking about them
was more important than memorizing irregular verbs.
when the bell rang after the last class, she left the school so fast that joanna had to
run to catch up with her.
after a while joanna said, "do you want to play cards this evening?"
sophie shrugged her shoulders.
"i'm not that interested in card games any more."
joanna looked surprised.
"you're not? let's play badminton then." 
sophie stared down at the pavement--then up at her friend.
"i don't think i'm that interested in badminton either."
"you're kidding!"
sophie noticed the touch of bitterness in joanna's tone.
"do you mind telling me what's suddenly so important?"

hie just shook her head. "it's ... it's a secret."
"yuck! you're probably in love!"
the two girls walked on for a while without saying anything. when they got to the
soccer field joanna said, "i'm going across the field."
across the field! it was the quickest way for joanna, but she only went that way when
she had to hurry home in time for visitors or a dental appointment.
sophie regretted having been mean to her. but what else could she have said? that
she had suddenly become so engrossed in who she was and where the world came
from that she had no time to play badminton? would joanna have understood?
why was it so difficult to be absorbed in the most vital and, in a way, the most natural
of all questions?
she felt her heart beating faster as she opened the mailb

sophie was just about to laugh, but she understood why the question was being
brought up now.
"are you nuts?" she said. "that only makes you duller'."
no more was said that evening about either drugs or white rabbits.
the myths
... a precarious balance between the forces of good and evil ...
there was no letter for sophie the next morning. all through the interminable day at 
school she was bored stiff. she took care to be extra nice to joanna during the breaks.
on the way home they talked about going camping as soon as the woods were dry
enough.
after what seemed an eternity she was once again at the mailbox. first she opened a
letter postmarked in mexico. it was from her father. he wrote about how much he was
longing for home and how for the first time he had managed to beat the chief officer
at chess. apart from that he had almost finished the pile of books he had brought
aboard with him after his winter leave.
and then, there it

she didn't look at her watch until she had crawled into the den. it was ten-thirty. she
put the big envelope into the biscuit tin with the other papers and stuffed the note with
the new questions down her tights.
her mother was on the telephone when she came in. when she saw sophie she hung
up quickly.
"where on earth have you been?"
"i... went for a walk ... in the woods," she stammered.
"so i see."
sophie stood silently, watching the water dripping from her dress.
"i called joanna..."
"joanna?"
her mother brought her some dry clothes. sophie only just managed to hide the
philosopher's note. then they sat together in the kitchen, and her mother made some
hot chocolate.
"were you with him?" she asked after a while.
"him?" 
sophie could only think about her philosophy teacher.
"with him, yes. him.... your rabbit!"
sophie shook her head.
"what do you do when you're together, sophie? why are you so wet?"
sophie sat staring gravely at the table. but deep down inside she was la

or idle hands.
sophie stayed in her room until her mother called her down to a big midday meal. she
had prepared sirloin steak and baked potatoes. there were cloudberries and cream for
dessert. 
they talked about all kinds of things. sophie's mother asked her how she wanted to
celebrate her fifteenth birthday. it was only a few weeks away.
sophie shrugged.
"aren't you going to invite anyone? i mean, don't you want to have a party?"
"maybe."
"we could ask martha and anne marie ... and helen. and joanna, of course. and
jeremy, perhaps. but that's for you to decide. i remember my own fifteenth birthday
so clearly, you know. it doesn't seem all that long ago. i felt i was already quite grown
up. isn't it odd, sophie! i don't feel i have changed at all since then."
"you haven't. nothing changes. you have just developed, gotten older..."
"mm ... that was a very grownup thing to say. i just think it's all happened so very
quickly."

card of the beach was also postmarked june--even though it was
a whole month off. she simply hadn't looked properly.
she glanced at her watch and then ran back to the house. she would just have to be
late for school today!
sophie let herself in and leaped upstairs to her room. she found the first postcard to
hilde under the red silk scarf. yes! it was also postmarked june 15! sophie's birthday
and the day before the summer vacation.
her mind was racing as she ran over to the supermarket to meet joanna.
who was hilde? how could her father as good as take it for granted that sophie
would find her? in any case, it was senseless of him to send sophie the cards instead
of sending them directly to his daughter. it could not possibly be because he didn't
know his own daughter's address. was it a practical joke? was he trying to surprise his
daughter on her birthday by getting a perfect stranger to play detective and mailman?
was that why she was being given a month's headstart? and was using her as

into an unnatural world. maybe it was not so dumb
after all to believe in fate. still--she shouldn't be jumping to conclusions; it could all
have a perfectly natural explanation. but how had alberto knox found hilde's wallet
when hilde lived in lillesand? lillesand was hundreds of miles away. and why had
sophie found this postcard on her sidewalk? did it fall out of the mailman's bag just
as he got to sophie's mailbox? if so, why should he drop this particular card?
"are you completely insane?" joanna burst out when sophie finally made it to the 
supermarket.
"sorry!"
joanna frowned at her severely, like a schoolteacher.
"you'd better have a good explanation."
"it has to do with the un," said sophie. "i was detained by hostile troops in
lebanon."
"sure ... you're just in love!"
they ran to school as fast as their legs could carry them.
the religious knowledge test that sophie had not had time to prepare for was given
out in the third period. the sheet read:

several days went by without any word from the philosophy teacher. tomorrow was
thursday, may 17-- norway's national day. school would be closed on the 18th as
well. as they walked home after school joanna suddenly exclaimed, "let's go
camping!"
sophie's immediate reaction was that she couldn't be away from the house for long. 
but then she said, "sure, why not?"
a couple of hours later joanna arrived at sophie's door with a large backpack. sophie
had packed hers as well, and she also had the tent. they both had bedrolls and
sweaters, groundsheets and flashlights, large-size thermos bottles and plenty of their
favorite food.
when sophie's mother got home around five o'clock, she gave them a sermo

d their tent in a clearing by grouse top. they had
prepared themselves for the night and their bedrolls were unfolded. when they had
eaten their sandwiches, sophie asked, "have you ever heard of the major's cabin?"
"the major's cabin?"
"there's a hut in the woods somewhere near here ... by a little lake. a strange man
lived there once, a major, that's why it's called the major's cabin."
"does anyone live there now?"
"do you want to go and see?"
"where is it?"
sophie pointed in among the trees. 
joanna was not particularly eager, but in the end they set out. the sun was low in the
sky.
they walked in between the tall pine trees at first, but soon they were pushing their
way through bush and thicket. eventually they made their way down to a path. could
it be the path sophie had followed that sunday morning?
it must have been--almost at once she could point to something shining between the
trees to the right of the path.
"it's in there," she said.
they were soon standing at the edge of the smal

l lake. sophie gazed at the cabin
across the water. all the windows were now shuttered up. the red building was the
most deserted place she had seen for ages.
joanna turned toward her. "do we have to walk on the water?"
"of course not. we'll row."
sophie pointed down into the reeds. there lay the rowboat, just as before.
"have you been here before?"
sophie shook her head. trying to explain her previous visit would be far too
complicated. and then she would have to tell her friend about alberto knox and the
philosophy course as well.
they laughed and joked as they rowed across the water. when they reached the
opposite bank, sophie made sure they drew the boa

t well up on land.
they went to the front door. as there was obviously nobody in the cabin, joanna tried
the door handle.
"locked... you didn't expect it to be open, did you?"
"maybe we can find a key," said sophie. 
she began to search in the crevices of the stonework foundation.
"oh, let's go back to the tent instead," said joanna after a few minutes.
but just then sophie exclaimed, "here it is! i found it!"
she held up the key triumphantly. she put it in the lock and the door swung open.
the two friends sneaked inside as if they were up to something criminal. it was cold
and dark in the cabin.
"we can't see a thing!" said joanna.
but sophie had thought of that. she took a box of matches out of her pocket and
struck one. they only had time to see that the cabin was deserted before the match
went out. sophie struck anothe

r, and this time she noticed a stump of candle in a
wrought-iron candlestick on top of the stove. she lit it with the third match and the
little room became light enough for them to look around.
"isn't it odd that such a small candle can light up so much darkness?" said sophie.
her friend nodded.
"but somewhere the light disappears into the dark," sophie went on. "actually,
darkness has no existence of its own. it's only a lack of light."
joanna shivered. "that's creepy! come on, let's go..."
"not before we've looked in the mirror."
sophie pointed to the brass mirror hanging above the chest of drawers, just as before.
"that's really pretty!" said joanna.
"but it's a magic mirror."
 "mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?" 
"i'm not kidding, joanna. i am sure you can look in it and see something on the other
side."
"are you sure you've never been here before? and why is it so amusing to scare me
all the time?"

e could not answer that one.
"sorry."
now it was joanna who suddenly discovered something lying on the floor in the
corner. it was a small box. joanna picked it up.
"postcards," she said.
sophie gasped.
"don't touch them! do you hear--don't you dare touch them!"
joanna jumped. she threw the box down as if she had burnt herself. the postcards
were strewn all over the floor. the next second she began to laugh.
"they're only postcards!"
joanna sat down on the floor and started to pick them up. after a while sophie sat
down beside her.
"lebanon ... lebanon ... lebanon ... they are all postmarked in lebanon," joanna
discovered.
"i know," said sophie.
joanna sat bolt upright and looked sophie in the eye.
"so you have been here before!"
"yes, i guess i have." 
it suddenly struck her that it would have been a whole lot easier if she had just
admitted she had been here before. it couldn't do any harm if she let her friend in on

ous things she had experienced during the last few days.
"i didn't want to tell you before we were here."
joanna began to read the cards.
"they are all addressed to someone called hilde moller knag."
sophie had not touched the cards yet.
"what address?"
joanna read: "hilde moller knag, c/o alberto knox, lillesand, norway."
sophie breathed a sigh of relief. she was afraid they would say c/o sophie amundsen.
she began to inspect them more closely.
"april 28 ... may 4 ... may 6 ... may 9 ... they were stamped a few days ago."
"but there's something else. all the postmarks are norwegian! look at that... un
battalion ... the stamps are norwegian too!"
"i think that's the way they do it. they have to be sort of neutral, so they have their
own norwegian pos

t office down there."
"but how do they get the mail home?"
"the air force, probably."
sophie put the candlestick on the floor, and the two friends began to read the cards.
joanna arranged them in chronological order and read the first card:
dear hilde, i can't wait to come home to lillesand. i expect to land at kjevik airport
early evening on midsummer eve. i would much rather have arrived in time for your 
15th birthday but i'm under military command of course. to make up for it, i promise
to devote all my loving care to the huge present you are getting for your birthday.
with love from someone who is always thinking about his daughter's future.

ng home and blowing the whole thing. it is
something that simply grows and grows. and as you know, when a thing gets bigger
and bigger it's more difficult to keep it to yourself. love from dad.
p.s. some day you will meet a girl called sophie. to give you both a chance to get to
know more about each other before you meet, i have begun sending her copies of all
the cards i send to you. i expect she will soon begin to catch on, hilde. as yet she
knows no more than you. she has a girlfriend called joanna. maybe site can be of 
help?
after reading the last card, joanna and sophie sat quite still staring wildly at each
other. joanna was holding sophie's wrist in a tight grip.
"i'm scared," she said.
"so am i."
"when was the last card stamped?"
sophie looked again at the card.
 "may 16," she said. "that's today."
"it can't be!" cried joanna, almost angrily.
they examined the postmark carefully, but there was no mistaking it... 05-16-90.
"it's impossible," insisted joanna. "and i can't imagine who 
 
 ___________________________
 
could have written it. it
must be someone who knows us. but how could they know we would come here on
this particular day?"
joanna was by far the more scared of the two. the business with hilde and her father
was nothing new to sophie.
"i think it has something to do with the brass mirror."
joanna jumped again.
"you don't actually think the cards come fluttering out of the mirror the minute they
are stamped in lebanon?"
"do you have a better explanation?"
"no."
sophie got to her feet and held the candle up in front of the two portraits on the wall. 
joanna came over and peered at the pictures.
"berkeley and bjerkely. what does that mean?"
"i have no idea."
the candle was almost burnt down.
"let's go," said joanna. "come on!"
"we must just take the mirror with us."
sophie reached up and u

nhooked the large brass mirror from the wall above the chest
of drawers. joanna tried to stop her but sophie would not be deterred.
when they got outside it was as dark as a may night can get. there was enough light
in the sky for the clear outlines of bushes and trees to be visible. the small lake lay
like a reflection of the sky above it. the two girls rowed pensively across to the other
side.
neither of them spoke much on the way back to the tent, but each knew that the other
was thinking intensely about what they had seen. now and then a frightened bird
would start up,

 and a couple of times they heard the hooting of an owl.
as soon as they reached the tent, they crawled into their bedrolls. joanna refused to
have the mirror inside the tent. before they fell asleep, they agreed that it was scary
enough, knowing it was just outside the tent flap. sophie had also taken the postcards
and put them in one of the pockets of her backpack.
they woke early next morning. sophie was up first. she put her boots on and went
outside the tent. there lay the large mirror in the grass, covered with dew.
sophie wiped the dew off with her sweater and gazed down at her own reflection. it
was as if she was lo

.
above the broad clearing behind the tent a ragged morning mist was drifting slowly
into little wads of cotton. small birds were chirping energetically but sophie could 
neither see nor hear any grouse.
the girls put on extra sweaters and ate their breakfast outside the tent. their
conversation soon turned to the major's cabin and the mysterious cards.
after breakfast they folded up the tent and set off for home. sophie carried the large
mirror under her arm. from time to time she had to rest--joanna refused to touch it.
as they approached the outskirts of the town they heard a few sporadic shots. sophie
recalled what hilde's father had written about war-torn lebanon, and she realized how
lucky she was to have been born in a peaceful country. the "shots" they heard came
from innocent fireworks celebrating the national holiday.
sophie invited joanna in for a cup of hot chocolate. her mother was very curious to
know where they had found the mirror. sophie told her they had found it outside th

e
major's cabin, and her mother repeated the story about nobody having lived there for
many years.
when joanna had gone, sophie put on a red dress. the rest of the norwegian national
day passed quite normally. in the evening, the tv news had a feature on how the
norwegian un battalion had celebrated the day in lebanon. sophie's eyes were glued
to the screen. one of the men she was seeing could be hilde's father.
the last thing sophie did on may 17 was to hang the large mirror on the wall in her
room. the following morning there was a new brown envelope in the den. she tore it
open at once and began to r

a week passed without sophie hearing from alberto knox. there were no more
postcards from lebanon either, although she and joanna still talked about the cards
they found in the major's cabin. joanna had had the fright of her life, but as nothing
further seemed to hap-pen, the immediate terror faded and was submerged in
homework and badminton.
sophie read alberto's letters over and over, looking for some clue that would throw
light on the hilde mystery. doing so also gave her plenty of opportunity to digest the
classical philosophy. she no longer had difficulty in distinguishing democritus and
socrates, or plato and aristo

ay hello to sophie, it had to mean that hilde knew more
about sophie than sophie did about hilde. it was all so complicated that sophie went
back to fixing dinner.
a postcard that smacked against the kitchen window all by itself! you could call that
airmail!
as soon as she had set the casserole on the stove again, the telephone rang.
suppose it was dad! she wished desperately that he would come home so she could
tell him everything that had happened in these last weeks. but it was probably only
joanna or mom. sophie snatched up the phone.
"sophie amundsen," she said.
 "it's me," said a voice.
sophie was sure of three things: it was not her father. but it was a man's voice, and a
voice she knew she had heard before. 
"who is this?"
"it's alberto."
"ohhh!"
sophie was at a loss for words. it was the voice from the acropolis video that she had
recognized.
"are you all right?"
"sure."
"from now on there will be no more letters."
"but i didn't send you a frog!"
"we must meet in person. it's beginn

the telephone clicked.
"hello?"
he had hung up! sophie rushed back to the stove just before the fish soup boiled over.
st. mary's church? that was an old stone church from the middle ages. it was only
used for concerts and very special ceremonies. and in the summer it was sometimes
open to tourists. but surely it wasn't open in the middle of the night?
when her mother got home, sophie had put the card from lebanon with everything
else from alberto and hilde. after dinner she went over to joanna's place.
"we have to make a very special arrangement," she said as soon as her friend opened
the door.
she said no more until joanna had closed her bedroom door.
"it's rather problematic," sophie went on.
"spit it out!"
"i'm going to have to tell mom that i'm staying the night here."
"great!"
"but it's only something i'm saying, you see. i've got to go somewhere else." 
"that's bad. is it a guy?"
"no, it's to do with hilde."
joanna whistled softly, and sophie looked her severely in the eye.

impression that her mother enjoyed having the house to herself.
"you'll be home for breakfast, i suppose?" was her mother's only remark as sophie
left the house.
"if i'm not, you know where i am."
what on earth made her say that? it was the one weak spot.
sophie's visit began like any other sleepover, with talk until late into the night. the
only difference was that when they finally settled down to sleep at about two o'clock,
sophie set the alarm clock to a quarter to seven.
five hours later, joanna woke briefly as sophie switched off the buzzer.
"take care," she mumbled.
then sophie was on her way. st. mary's church lay on the outskirts of the old part of
town. it was several miles walk away, but even though she had only slept for a few
hours she felt wide awake.
it was almost eight o'clock when she stood at the entrance to the old stone church.
sophie tried the massive door. it was unlocked! 
inside the church it was as deserted and silent as the church was old. a bluish light

rt the great..."
with that he bowed his head and disappeared through the door of st. mary's church.
sophie was not satisfied with his answer. she followed him into the church. but now
it was completely empty. did he go through the floor?
just as she was leaving the church she noticed a picture of the madonna. she went up
to it and studied it closely. suddenly she discovered a little drop of water under one of
the madonna's eyes. was it a tear?
sophie rushed out of the church and hurried back to joanna's.

...o divine lineage in mortal guise...
it was just twelve when sophie reached joanna's front gate, out of breath with running.
joanna was standing in the front yard outside her family's yellow house.
"you've been gone for five hours!" joanna said sharply.
sophie shook her head.
"no, i've been gone for more than a thousand years."
"where on earth have you been? you're crazy. your mom called half an hour ago."
"what did you tell her?"
"i said you were at the drugstore. she said

you should have seen my mom and dad when they came in with hot chocolate and

"what did you say to them?"
"it was really embarrassing. i told them you went home because we got mad at each
other."
"so we'd better hurry up and be friends again. and we have to make sure your parents
don't talk to my mom for a few days. do you think we can do that?"
joanna shrugged. just then her father came around the corner with a wheelbarrow. he
had a pair of coveralls on and was busy clearing up last year's leaves and twigs.
"aha--so you're friends again, i see. well, there's not so much as a single leaf left on
the basement steps now."
"fine," said sophie. "so perhaps we can have our hot chocolate there instead of in
bed."
joanna's dad gave a forced laugh, but joanna gasped. verbal exchanges had always
been more robust in sophie's family than at the more wel

"i'm sorry, joanna, but i felt i ought to take part in this cover-up operation as well."
"are you going to tell me about it?"
"sure, if you walk home with me. because it's not for the ears of financial advisers or
overgrown barbie dolls."
"that's a rotten thing to say! i suppose you think a rocky marriage that drives one of
the partners away to sea is better?"
"probably not. but i hardly slept last night. and another thing, i've begun to wonder
whether hilde can see everything we do."

"you mean she might have second sight?"
"maybe. maybe not."
joanna was clearly not enthusiastic about all this secrecy.
"but that doesn't explain why her father sent a lot of crazy postcards to an empty
cabin in the woods."
"i admit that is a weak spot."
"do you want to tell me where you have been?"
so she did. sophie told her everything, about the mysterious philosophy course as
well. she made joanna swear to keep everything secret.
they walked for a long time without speaking. as they approached clover close,
joanna said, "i don't like it."
she stopped at sophie's gate and turned to go home again.
"nobody asked you to like it. but philosophy is not a harmless party game. it's about
who we are and where we come from. do you think we learn enough about that at
school?"
 "nobody can answer questions like that anyway."
"yes, but we don't even learn to ask them!"
lunch was on the table when sop

hie walked into the kitchen. nothing was said about
her not having called from joanna's.
after lunch sophie announced that she was going to take a nap. she admitted she had
hardly slept at joanna's house, which was not at all unusual at a sleepover.
before getting into bed she stood in front of the big brass mirror which now hung on
her wall. at first she only saw her own white and exhausted face. but then-- behind 
her own face, the faintest suggestion of another face seemed to appear. sophie took
one or two deep breaths. it was no good starting to imagine things.
she studied the sharp contours of her own pale face framed by that impossible hair
which defied any style but nature's own.

sophie shivered. she felt a chill run down her spine.

...such stuff as dreams are made on...
sophie heard nothing more from alberto for several days, but she glanced frequently
into the garden hoping to catch sight of hermes. she told her mother that the dog had
found its own way home and that she had been invited in by its owner, a former
physics teacher. he had told sophie about the solar system and the new science that
developed in the sixteenth century.
she told joanna more. she told her all about her visit to alberto, the postcard in the
mailbox, and the ten-crown piece she had found on the way home. she kept the dream
about hilde and the gold crucifix to herself.
on tuesday, may 29, sophie was standing in the kitchen doing the dishes. her mother
had gone into the living room to watch the tv news. when the opening theme faded
out she heard from the kitchen that a major in the norwegian un battalion had been

sophie had just managed to finish reading the card when the last bell rang. once again
her thoughts were in turmoil.
joanna was waiting in the playground. on the way home sophie opened her
schoolbag and showed joanna the latest card.
"when is it postmarked?" asked joanna.
"probably june 15 ..."
"no, look ... 5/30/90, it says." 
 "that was yesterday ... the day after the death of the major in lebanon."
"i doubt if a postcard from lebanon can get to norway in one day," said joanna.
"especially not considering the rather unusual address: hilde moller knag, c/o sophie
amundsen, fu-rulia junior high school..."
"do you th

"everyone to his own taste, in other words."
"exactly. everyone can agree on the primary qualities like size and weight because
they lie within the objects themselves. but the secondary qualities like color and taste
can vary from person to person and from animal to animal, depending on the nature of
the individual's sensations."
"when joanna eats an orange, she gets a look on her face like when other people eat a

usually think the same orange is nice and sweet."
"and neither one of you is right or wrong. you are just describing how the orange
affects your senses. it's the same with the sense of color. maybe you don't like a
certain shade of red. but if joanna buys a dress in that color it might be wise to keep

"if the black ball hits the white one, the white one will start to move."
"i see, and why will it do that?"
"because it was hit by the black one."
"so we usually say that the impact of the black ball is the cause of the white ball's

"i have actually experienced it lots of times. joanna has a pool table in her basement."
"hume would say the only thing you have experienced is that the white ball begins to

farther down the page there were two typewritten lines of poetry:

hilde turned to the next page, to the beginning of the first chapter. it was entitled "the
garden of eden." she got into bed, sat up comfortably, resting the ring binder against
her knees, and began to read.
sophie amundsen was on her way home from school. she had walked the first part of
the way with joanna. they had been discussing robots. joanna thought the human
brain was like an advanced computer. sophie was not certain she agreed. surely a
person was more than a piece of hardware?
hilde read on, oblivious of all else, even forgetting that it was her birthday. from time
to time a brief thought crept in between the lines as she read: had dad written a book?
had he finally begun on the significant novel and completed it in lebanon? he had
often complained that time hung heavily on one's hands in

not bad! that made her 150 crowns richer. he probably thought a homemade present
alone wasn't enough.
so it appeared that june 15 was sophie's birthday, too. but sophie's calendar had only
gotten as far as the middle of may. that must have been when her father had written
this chapter, and he had postdated the "birthday card" to hilde. but poor sophie,
running down to the supermarket to meet joanna.
who was hilde? how could her father as good as take it for granted that sophie
would find her? in any case, it was senseless of him to send sophie the cards instead
of sending them directly to his daughter.
hilde, like sophie, was elevated to the celestial spheres as she read about plotinus.
i believe there is something of the divine mystery in everything that exists. we can
see it sparkle in a sunflower or a poppy. we sense more of the unfathomable mystery
in a butterfly that flutters from a

ome one with the greatest
mystery of life. in truth, at very rare moments we can experience that we ourselves
are that divine mystery.
this was the most giddying passage hilde had read up to now. but it was nevertheless
the simplest. everything is one, and this "one" is a divine mystery that everyone 
shares.
this was not really something you needed to believe. it is so, thought hilde. so
everyone can read what they like into the word "divine."
she turned quickly to the next chapter. sophie and joanna go camping the night
before the national holiday on may 17. they make their way to the major's cabin...
hilde had not read many pages before she flung the bedclothes angrily aside, got up,
and began to walk up and down, clutching the ring binder in her hands.
this was just about the most impudent trick she had ever heard of. in that little hut in
the woods, her father lets these two girls find copies of all the cards he had sent hilde
in the first two weeks of may. and the copies were real enou

ost transfiguring conviction that sophie and alberto 
really existed. still waters run deep, she thought to herself.
why did that idea come to her?
it was certainly not a thought that rippled the surface.
at school, sophie received lots of attention because it was her birthday. her
classmates were already keyed up by thoughts of summer vacation, and grades, and
the sodas on the last day of school. the minute the teacher dismissed the class with
her best wishes for the vacation, sophie ran home. joanna tried to slow her down but
sophie called over her shoulder that there was something she just had to do.
in the mailbox she found two cards from lebanon. they were both birthday cards:
happy birthday--15 years. one of them was to "hilde m0ller knag, c/o
sophie amundsen . . ." but the other one was to sophie herself. both cards were
stamped "un battalion--june 15."
sophie read her own card first:
dear sophie amundsen, today you are getting a card as well. happy birthday, sophie,
and many thanks f

between the storm and the fallen
branches and her meeting with little red ridinghood and winnie-the-pooh.
she went into the house. her mother had just gotten home and was putting some
bottles of soda in the refrigerator. on the table was a delicious-looking chocolate
cake. 
"are you expecting visitors?" asked sophie; she had almost forgotten it was her
birthday.
"we're having the real party next saturday, but i thought we ought to have a little
celebration today as well."
"how?"
"i have invited joanna and her parents."
"fine with me."
the visitors arrived shortly before half-past seven. the atmosphere was somewhat
formal--sophie's mother very seldom saw joanna's parents socially.
it was not long before sophie and joanna went upstairs to sophie's room to write the
garden party invitations. since alberto knox was also to be invited, sophie had the
idea of inviting people to a "philosophical garden party." joanna didn't object. it was
sophie's party after all, and theme parties were "in" at the

the evening we shall hopefully solve the
mystery of life. please bring warm sweaters and bright ideas suitable for solving the
riddles of philosophy. because of the danger of woodland fires we unfortunately
cannot have a bonfire, but everybody is free to let the flames of their imagination
flicker unimpeded. there will be at least one genuine philosopher among the invited
guests. for this reason the party is a strictly private arrangement. members of the
press will not be admitted. with regards,joanna ingebrigtsen (organizing committee)
and sophie amundsen (hostess)
the two girls went downstairs to their parents, who were now talking somewhat more
freely. sophie handed the draft invitation, written with a calligraphic pen, to her 
mother.
"could you make eighteen copies, please." it was not the first time she had asked her
mother to make photocopies for her at work.
her mother read the invitation and then handed it to joanna's father.
"you see what i mean? she is going a little crazy."
"but

it looks really exciting," said joanna's father, handing the sheet on to his wife. "i
wouldn't mind coming to that party myself."
barbie read the invitation, then she said: "well, i must say! can we come too,
sophie?"
"let's say twenty copies, then," said sophie, taking them at their word.
"you must be nuts!" said joanna.
before sophie went to bed that night she stood for a long time gazing out of the
window. she remembered how she had once seen the outline of alberto's figure in the
darkness. it was more than a month ago. now it was again late at night, but this was a
white summer night.
sophie heard nothing from alberto until tuesday morning. he called just after her
mother had left for work.
"sophie amundsen."
"and alberto knox."
"i thought so."
"i'm sorry i didn't call before, but i've been working hard on

 philosophical tradition in general, and of hegel in
particular. but they also embodied a trenchant 'social criticism.' the individual in
modern urban society had become 'the public,' he said, and the predominant
characteristic of the crowd, or the masses, was all their noncommittal 'talk.' today we
would probably use the word 'conformity'; that is when everybody 'thinks' and
'believes in' the same things without having any deeper feeling about it."
"i wonder what kierkegaard would have said to joanna's parents."
"he was not always kind in his judgments. he had a sharp pen and a bitter sense of
irony. for example, he could say things like 'the crowd is the untruth,' or 'the truth is
always in the minority/ and that most people had a superficial approach to life."
"it's one thing to collect barbie dolls. but it's worse to be one."
"that brings us to kierkegaard's theory of what he called the three stages on life's
way."
"pardon me?"
"kierkegaard believed that there were three different forms

eaving any message."
"i'm sorry, mom. it was such a lovely day, i went for a long walk."
her mother rose from the pile of weeds and gave her a severe look.
"you haven't been with that philosopher again?"
"as a matter of fact, i have. i told you he likes going for long walks."
"but he is coming to the garden party, isn't he?"
"oh yes, he's looking forward to it."
"me too. i'm counting the days."
was there a touch of sharpness in her voice? to be on the safe side, sophie said:
"i'm glad i invited joanna's parents too. otherwise it might be a bit embarrassing."
"i don't know ... but whatever happens, i am going to have a talk with this alberto as
one adult to another."
"you can borrow my room if you like. i'm sure you'll like him." 
"and another thing. there's a letter for you."
"there is?"
"it's stamped un battalion."
"it must be from alberto's brother."
"it's got to stop, sophie!"
sophie's brain worked overtime. but in a flash she hit on a plausible answer it was as
though she was getting ins

more amicable tone.
"where's the letter?"
"on top of the fridge."
sophie rushed inside. the envelope was stamped june 15, 1990. she opened it and
took out a little note:
what matters our creative endless toil, when at a snatch, oblivion ends the coil?
indeed, sophie had no answer to that question. before she ate, she put the note in the
closet together with all the other stuff she had collected in the past weeks. she would
learn soon enough why the question had been asked.
the following morning joanna came by. after a game of badminton, they got down to
planning the philosophical garden party. they needed to have some surprises on hand
in case the party flopped at any point.
when sophie's mother got home from work they were still talking about it. her
mother kept saying: "don't worry about what it costs." and she was not being 
sarcastic!
perhaps she was thinking that a "philosophical garden party" was just what was
needed to bring sophie down to earth again after her many weeks of intensive

"would you mind very much waiting till we get home, at least. it is my book, mom."
"of course it's your book. i just want to take a peek at the first page, okay? ... 'sophie

"does it really say that?"
"yes, it does, sophie. it's written by someone called albert knag. he must be a
newcomer. what's your al-berto's name, by the way?"
"knox."
"it'll probably turn out that this extraordinary person has written a whole book about
you, sophie. it's called using a pseudonym."
"it's not him, mom. why don't you just give up. you don't understand anything
anyway."
"no, i don't suppose i do. the garden party is tomorrow, then everything

rosebeds."
"i'll tell you what, sophie. i don't think i believe in real philosophers any longer.

they spent the afternoon and evening preparing. they continued the next morning,
setting and decorating the table. joanna came over to give them a hand.
"good grief!" she said, "mom and dad are coming too. it's your fault, sophie!" 
everything was ready half an hour before the guests were due. the trees were
festooned with streamers and japanese lanterns. the garden gate, the trees lining the
path, and the front of the house were hung with balloons. sophie and joanna had
spent most of the afternoon blowing them up.
the table was set with chicken, salad, and different kinds of homemade bread. in the

itself.
"we haven't spared any expense," she repeated several times in the half hour before
the party was due to start.
the guests began to arrive. first came three of the girls from sophie's class, dressed in
summer shirts and light cardigans, long skirts, and the barest suggestion of eye
makeup. a bit later, jeremy and david came strolling in through the gate, with a blend
of shyness and boyish arrogance.
"happy birthday!"
"you're an adult now, too!"
sophie noticed that joanna and jeremy had already begun eyeing each other discreetly.
there was something in the air. it was midsummer eve.
everybody had brought birthday presents, and as it was a philosophical garden party,
several of the guests had tried to find out what philosophy was. although not all of
them had managed to find philosophical presents, most of them had written something
philosophical on their cards. sophie received a philosophical dictionary as well as a
diary with a lock; on the cover was written my

thoughts. as the guests arrived they were served apple juice in long-stemmed
wine glasses. sophie's mother did the serving. 
"welcome ... and what is this young man's name? i don't believe we've met before ...
so glad you could come, cecilie . . ."
when all the younger guests had arrived and were strolling under the trees with their
wine glasses, joanna's parents drew up at the garden gate in a white mercedes. the
financial adviser was impeccably dressed in an expensively cut gray suit. his wife
was wearing a red pants suit with dark red sequins. sophie was sure she had bought a
barbie doll in a toy store dressed in that suit, and had a tailor make it up in her size.
there was another possibility; the financial adviser could have bought the doll and
given it to a magician to make into a live woman. but this possibility was unlikely, so
sophie

rejected it.
they stepped out of the mercedes and walked into the garden where younger guests
looked at them with surprise. the financial adviser presented a long, narrow package
from the ingebrigtsen family. sophie tried hard to maintain her composure when it
turned out to be--yes, it was!--a barbie doll. but joanna made no such effort:
"are you crazy? sophie doesn't play with dolls!"
mrs. ingebrigtsen came hurrying over, with all her sequins clanking. "but it's only for
decoration, you know."
"well, thank you very much indeed." sophie tried to smooth things over. "now i can
start ft collection."
people began to drift toward the table.
"we're only waiting for alberto," said sophie's mother to her in a somewhat brisk
tone that was intended to hide her growing apprehension. rumors of the special guest

sophie?"
"many thanks," said alberto. he sat down.
"cheers!" said sophie, and the guests raised their glasses and drank his health.
they sat for a long time over their chicken and salad. suddenly joanna got up, walked 
determinedly over to jeremy, and gave him a resounding kiss on the lips. he
responded by trying to topple her backward over the table so as to get a better grip as
he returned her kiss.
"well, i've never ..." exclaimed mrs. ingebrigtsen.
"not on the table, children," was mrs. amundsen's only comment.
"why not?" asked alberto, turning toward her.
"that was an odd question."
"it's never wrong for a real philosopher to ask questions."

sed started to throw chicken bones up
on the roof. this, too, elicited only a mild comment from sophie's mother:
"would you mind not doing that. it's such a nuisance when there are chicken bones in
the gutter."
"sorry," said one of the boys, whereupon they started throwing chicken bones over the
garden hedge instead.
"i think it's time to clear the plates away and serve the cake," said mrs. amundsen
finally. "sophie and joanna, will you give me a hand?"
on their way to the kitchen there was only time for a brief discussion.
"what made you kiss him?" sophie said to joanna.
"i sat looking at his mouth and couldn't resist it. he is so cute!"
"how did it taste?"
"not exactly like i'd imagined, but. . ."
"it was the first time, then?" 
"but not the last!"
coffee and cake were soon on the table. alberto had started giving the boys some of
his firecrackers when sophie's mother tapped on her coffee cup.
"i am not going to ma

what is more, with a father who is at sea so much, she makes calls to all parts of the
world. we congratulate you on your fifteenth birthday, sophie!"
"delightful!" exclaimed mrs. ingebrigtsen.
sophie was not sure whether she was referring to her mother, the speech, the birthday
cake, or sophie herself.
the guests applauded, and one of the boys threw a firecracker up into the pear tree.
joanna left the table and pulled jeremy up off his chair. they lay down on the grass
and started kissing each other again. after a while they rolled in under the red-currant
bushes.
"nowadays it's the girl who takes the initiative," said mr. ingebrigtsen.
having said that, he got up and went over to the red-currant bushes where he stood
observing the phenomenon at close quarters. the rest of the guests followed suit.
only sophie and alberto remained sitting at the table. the other guests now stood in

semicircle around joanna and jeremy.
"they can't be stopped," said mrs. ingebrigtsen, not without a certain pride.
"no, generation follows generation," said her husband.
he looked around, expecting applause for his well-chosen words. when the only 
response was a few silent nods, he added: "it can't be helped."
sophie saw from a distance that jeremy was trying to unbutton joanna's white shirt,
which was already covered with green stains from the grass. she was fumbling with
his belt.
"don't catch cold!" said mrs. ingebrigtsen.
sophie looked despairingly at alberto.
"it's happening more quickly than i thought," he said. "we have to get away from here
as soon as possible. i just have to make a short speech."
sophie clapped her hands loudly.
"could everyone please come back and sit down again? alberto is going to make a
speech."

talking of something worse than a natural catastrophe, sir. but as you are probably
aware, insurance doesn't cover those either."
"this is not a natural catastrophe."
"no, it is an existential catastrophe. for example, just take a look under the currant
bushes and you will see what i mean. you cannot insure yourself against the collapse
of your whole life. neither can you insure yourself against the sun going out."
"do we have to put up with this?" asked joanna's father, looking at his wife.
she shook her head, and so did sophie's mother.
"what a shame," she said, "and after we had spared no expense."
the younger guests continued to look at alberto. "we want to hear more," said a
curly-haired boy with glasses.
"thank you, but there is not much more to say. when you have realized that you are a
dream image in another person's sleepy consciousness, then, in my opinion, it is
wisest to be silent. but i can finish by recommending that you take a short cou

"neither you nor anyone else here will miss us for the simple reason that you do not

"that is the worst insult i've ever heard," mrs. ingebrigtsen burst out. 
her husband nodded.
"if nothing else, we can always get him nailed for defamation of character. i'm sure
he's a communist. he wants to strip us of everything we hold dear. the man's a
scoundrel."
with that, both alberto and the financial adviser sat down. the letter's face was
crimson with rage. now joanna and jeremy also came and sat at the table. their
clothes were grubby and crumpled. joanna's golden hair was caked with mud and
earth.
"mom, i'm going to have a baby," she announced.
"all right, but you'll have to wait till you get home."
she had immediate support from her husband. "she'll simply have to contain herself,"
he said. "and if there is to be a christening tonight, she'll have to arrange it herself."
alberto looked down at sophie with a somber expression.
"it's time."

party than a young woman's philosophical celebration. several soda bottles had been
knocked over on the table, there was chocolate cake smeared all over the tablecloth
and the dish of raisin buns lay upside down on the lawn. just as sophie arrived, one of
the boys put a firecracker to the layer cake, which exploded all over the table and the 
guests. the worst casualty was mrs. ingebrigtsen's red pants suit. the curious thing
was that both she and everybody else took it with the utmost calm. joanna picked up a
huge piece of chocolate cake, smeared it all over jeremy's face, and proceeded to lick
it off again.
her mother and alberto were sitting in the glider a little way away from the others.
they waved to sophie.
"so you finally had your confidential talk," said sophie.
"and you were perfectly right," said her mother, quite elated now. "alberto is a very
altruistic person. i entrust you to his strong arms."
sophie sat down between them.
two of the boys had managed to climb onto the roof.

nd everything. can i go down to her?" 
"naturally. i'll stay here."
sophie ran down to the dock. she almost stumbled and fell over hilde. but she sat
down politely beside her.
hilde sat idly playing with the line that the rowboat was made fast with. in her left
hand she held a slip of paper. she was clearly waiting. she glanced at her watch
several times.
sophie thought she was very pretty. she had fair, curly hair and bright green eyes. she
was wearing a yellow summer dress. she was not unlike joanna.
sophie tried to talk to her even though she knew it was useless.
"hilde--it's sophie!"
hilde gave no sign that she had heard.
sophie got onto her knees and tried to shout in her ear:
"can you hear me, hilde? or are you both deaf and blind?"
did she, or didn't she, open her eyes a little wider? wasn't there a very slight sign that
she had heard something--however faintly?
she looked around. then she turned her head sharply and stared right into sophie's
eyes. she did not focus on her properly;
