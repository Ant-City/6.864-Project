did your man talk about?

mrs. marchmont.  about myself.

lady basildon.  [_languidly_.]  and were you interested?

mrs. marchmont.  [_shaking her head_.]  not in the smallest degree.

lady basildon.  what martyrs we are, dear margaret!

mrs. marchmont.  [_rising_.]  and how well it becomes us, olivia!

[_they rise and go towards the music-room_.  _the_ vicomte de nanjac, _a
young attachÃ© known for his neckties and his anglomania_, _approaches
with a low bow_, _and enters into conversation_.]

mason.  [_announcing guests from the top of the staircase_.]  mr. and
lady jane barford.  lord caversham.

[_enter_ lord caversham, _an old gentleman of seventy_, _wearing the
riband and star of the garter_.  _a fine whig type_.  _rather like a
portrait by lawrence_.]

lord caversham.  good evening, lady chiltern!  has my good-for-nothing
young son been here?

lady chiltern.  [_smiling_.]  i donâ€™t think lord goring has arrived yet.

mabel chiltern.  [_coming up to_ lord caversham.]  why do you call

ty!  i think it has immensely
improved.  it is entirely composed now of beautiful idiots and brilliant
lunatics.  just what society should be.

lord caversham.  hum!  which is goring?  beautiful idiot, or the other
thing?

mabel chiltern.  [_gravely_.]  i have been obliged for the present to put
lord goring into a class quite by himself.  but he is developing
charmingly!

lord caversham.  into what?

mabel chiltern.  [_with a little curtsey_.]  i hope to let you know very
soon, lord caversham!

mason.  [_announcing guests_.]  lady markby.  mrs. cheveley.

[_enter_ lady markby _and_ mrs. cheveley.  lady markby _is a pleasant_,
_kindly_, _popular woman_, _with gray hair Ã  la marquise and good lace_.
mrs. cheveley, _who accompanies her_, _is tall and rather slight_.  _lips
very thin and highly-coloured_, _a line of scarlet on a pallid face_.
_venetian red hair_, _aquiline nose_, _and long throat_.  _rouge
accentuates the natural paleness of her complexion_.  _gray-green eyes
that move restles

s. cheveley.  [_smiling_.]  intimately.  did you?

sir robert chiltern.  at one time.

mrs. cheveley.  wonderful man, wasnâ€™t he?

sir robert chiltern.  [_after a pause_.]  he was very remarkable, in many
ways.

mrs. cheveley.  i often think it such a pity he never wrote his memoirs.
they would have been most interesting.

sir robert chiltern.  yes: he knew men and cities well, like the old
greek.

mrs. cheveley.  without the dreadful disadvantage of having a penelope
waiting at home for him.

mason.  lord goring.

[_enter_ lord goring.  _thirty-four_, _but always says he is younger_.
_a well-bred_, _expressionless face_.  _he is clever_, _but would not
like to be thought so_.  _a flawless dandy_, _he would be annoyed if he
were considered romantic_.  _he plays with life_, _and is on perfectly
good terms with the world_.  _he is fond of being misunderstood_.  _it
gives him a post of vantage_.]

sir robert chiltern.  good evening, my dear arthur!  mrs. cheveley, allow
me to introduce to you

once that she has
been mistaken in youâ€”and that you are not a man to do anything base or
underhand or dishonourable.  write here, robert.  write that you decline
to support this scheme of hers, as you hold it to be a dishonest scheme.
yesâ€”write the word dishonest.  she knows what that word means.  [sir
robert chiltern _sits down and writes a letter_.  _his wife takes it up
and reads it_.]  yes; that will do.  [_rings bell_.]  and now the
envelope.  [_he writes the envelope slowly_.  _enter_ mason.]  have this
letter sent at once to claridgeâ€™s hotel.  there is no answer.  [_exit_
mason.  lady chiltern _kneels down beside her husband_, _and puts her
arms around him_.]  robert, love gives one an instinct to things.  i feel
to-night that i have saved you from something that might have been a
danger to you, from something that might have made men honour you less
than they do.  i donâ€™t think you realise sufficiently, robert, that you
have brought into the political life of our time a nobl

love you, robert.

sir robert chiltern.  oh, love me always, gertrude, love me always!

lady chiltern.  i will love you always, because you will always be worthy
of love.  we needs must love the highest when we see it!  [_kisses him
and rises and goes out_.]

[sir robert chiltern _walks up and down for a moment_; _then sits down
and buries his face in his hands_.  _the servant enters and begins
pulling out the lights_.  sir robert chiltern _looks up_.]

sir robert chiltern.  put out the lights, mason, put out the lights!

[_the servant puts out the lights_.  _the room becomes almost dark_.
_the only light there is comes from the great chandelier that hangs over
the staircase and illumines the tapestry of the triumph of love_.]

them.

sir robert chiltern.  [_writing_.]  why do you say that?

lord goring.  [_turning round_.]  well, she wore far too much rouge last
night, and not quite enough clothes.  that is always a sign of despair in
a woman.

sir robert chiltern.  [_striking a bell_.]  but it is worth while my
wiring to vienna, is it not?

lord goring.  it is always worth while asking a question, though it is
not always worth while answering one.

[_enter_ mason.]

sir robert chiltern.  is mr. trafford in his room?

mason.  yes, sir robert.

sir robert chiltern.  [_puts what he has written into an envelope_,
_which he then carefully closes_.]  tell him to have this sent off in
cipher at once.  there must not be a momentâ€™s delay.

mason.  yes, sir robert.

sir robert chiltern.  oh! just give that back to me again.

 gertrude, do
you know who is coming to see you?  that dreadful mrs. cheveley, in a
most lovely gown.  did you ask her?

lady chiltern.  [_rising_.]  mrs. cheveley!  coming to see me?
impossible!

mabel chiltern.  i assure you she is coming upstairs, as large as life
and not nearly so natural.

lady chiltern.  you need not wait, mabel.  remember, lady basildon is
expecting you.

mabel chiltern.  oh! i must shake hands with lady markby.  she is
delightful.  i love being scolded by her.

[_enter_ mason.]

mason.  lady markby.  mrs. cheveley.

[_enter_ lady markby _and_ mrs. cheveley.]

lady chiltern.  [_advancing to meet them_.]  dear lady markby, how nice
of you to come and see me!  [_shakes hands with her_, _and bows somewhat
distantly to_ mrs. cheveley.]  wonâ€™t you sit down, mrs. cheveley?

mrs. cheveley.  thanks.  isnâ€™t that miss chiltern?  i should like so much
to know her.

lady chiltern.  mabel, mrs. cheveley wishes to know you.

 should arrange a proper scheme of
assisted emigration.  it would do a great deal of good.

mrs. cheveley.  i quite agree with you, lady markby.  it is nearly six
years since i have been in london for the season, and i must say society
has become dreadfully mixed.  one sees the oddest people everywhere.

lady markby.  that is quite true, dear.  but one neednâ€™t know them.  iâ€™m
sure i donâ€™t know half the people who come to my house.  indeed, from all
i hear, i shouldnâ€™t like to.

[_enter_ mason.]

lady chiltern.  what sort of a brooch was it that you lost, mrs.
cheveley?

mrs. cheveley.  a diamond snake-brooch with a ruby, a rather large ruby.

lady markby.  i thought you said there was a sapphire on the head, dear?

mrs. cheveley [_smiling_.]  no, lady markbyâ€”a ruby.

lady markby.  [_nodding her head_.]  and very becoming, i am quite sure.

lady chiltern.  has a ruby and diamond brooch been found in any of the
rooms this morning, mason?

mason.  no, my lady.

mrs. cheveley.  it rea

lady chiltern.  [_coldly_.]  oh, it has been no inconvenience.  that will
do, mason.  you can bring tea.

[_exit_ mason.]

lady markby.  well, i must say it is most annoying to lose anything.  i
remember once at bath, years ago, losing in the pump room an exceedingly
handsome cameo bracelet that sir john had given me.  i donâ€™t think he has
ever given me anything since, i am sorry to say.  he has sadly
degenerated.  really, this horrid house of commons quite ruins our
husbands for us.  i think the lower house by far the greatest blow to a
happy married life that there has been since that terrible thing called

him!  can he deny it?  does he dare to?

sir robert chiltern.  go!  go at once.  you have done your worst now.

mrs. cheveley.  my worst?  i have not yet finished with you, with either
of you.  i give you both till to-morrow at noon.  if by then you donâ€™t do
what i bid you to do, the whole world shall know the origin of robert
chiltern.

sir robert chiltern.  show mrs. cheveley out.

to_ lady chiltern, _who makes no sign of response_.  _as she passes by_
sir robert chiltern, _who is standing close to the door_, _she pauses for
a moment and looks him straight in the face_.  _she then goes out_,
_followed by the servant_, _who closes the door after him_.  _the husband
and wife are left alone_.  lady chiltern _stands like some one in a
dreadful dream_.  _t

himself_, _and with an entirely new buttonhole that some one has made for
him_.]

sir robert chiltern.  [_going towards him_.]  arthur, i have to thank you
for what you have done for me.  i donâ€™t know how i can repay you.
[_shakes hands with him_.]

lord goring.  my dear fellow, iâ€™ll tell you at once.  at the present
moment, under the usual palm tree . . . i mean in the conservatory . . .

mason.  lord caversham.

lord goring.  that admirable father of mine really makes a habit of
turning up at the wrong moment.  it is very heartless of him, very
heartless indeed.

[_enter_ lord caversham.  mason _goes out_.]

lord caversham.  good morning, lady chiltern!  warmest congratulations to
you, chiltern, on your brilliant speech last night.  i have just left the
prime minister, and you are to have the vacant seat in the cabinet.

lord caversham.  [_considerably taken aback_.]  what does this mean, sir?
you donâ€™t mean to say that this charming, clever young lady has been so
foolish as to accept you?

lord goring.  certainly, father!  and chilternâ€™s been wise enough to
accept the seat in the cabinet.

lord caversham.  i am very glad to hear that, chiltern . . . i
congratulate you, sir.  if the country doesnâ€™t go to the dogs or the
radicals, we shall have you prime minister, some day.

[_enter_ mason.]

mason.  luncheon is on the table, my lady!

[mason _goes out_.]

mabel chiltern.  youâ€™ll stop to luncheon, lord caversham, wonâ€™t you?

lord caversham.  with pleasure, and iâ€™ll drive you down to downing street
afterwards, chiltern.  you have a great future before you, a great
future.  wish i could say the same for you, sir.  [_to_ lord goring.]
but your career will have to be entirely domestic.

lord goring.  yes, father, i prefer it domestic.
