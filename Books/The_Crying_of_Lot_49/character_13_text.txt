d trystero, unless it be a pseudo-italianate variant on triste (= wretched, depraved). but the 'white-chapel' edition, besides 
being a fragment, abounds in such corrupt and probably spurious lines, as we have mentioned elsewhere, and is hardly to be 
trusted. 

then where, oedipa wondered, does the paperback i bought at zapf's get off with its "trystero" line? was there yet 

another edition, besides the quarto, folio, and "whitechapel" fragment? the editor's preface, signed this time, by one 
emory bortz, professor of english at cal, mentioned none. she spent nearly an hour more, searching through all the foot-
notes, finding nothing. 

"dammit," she yelled, started the car and headed for the berkeley campus, to find professor bortz. 
she should have remembered the date on the book —1957. another world. the girl in the english office informed oedipa 

that professor bortz was no longer with the faculty. he was teaching at san narciso college, san narciso, california.

have felt more classically scorned, but had other 

things on her mind. first thing after unpacking she was on the horn to randolph driblette, the director. after about ten rings 
an elderly lady answered. "i'm sorry, we've nothing to say." 
"well who's this," oedipa said. 

sigh. "this is his mother. there'll be a statement at noon tomorrow. our lawyer will read it." she hung up. now what the 
hell, oedipa wondered: what had happened to driblette? she decided to call later. she found professor emory bortz's number 
in the book and had better luck. a wife named grace answered, backed by a group of children. "he's pouring a patio," she told 
oedipa. "it's a highly organized joke that's been going on since about april. he sits in the sun, drinks beer with students, lobs beer 
bottles at seagulls. you'd better talk to him before it gets that far. maxine, why don't you throw that at your brother, he's more 
mobile than i am. did you know emory's done a new edition of wharfinger? it'll be out——" b

good. if she was mine i'd drown her." 

"never thought of doing it that way," said grace bortz, materializing from the dim living room. "come on in." with a wet 

washcloth she started to clean off her child's face. "how did you manage to get away from yours today?" 

"i don't have any," said oedipa, following her into the kitchen. 
grace looked surprised. "there's a certain harassed style," she said, "you get to recognize. i thought only kids caused it. i guess 

not." 

emory bortz lay half in a hammock, surrounded by three graduate students, two male, one female, all sodden with drink, and 

an astounding accumulation of empty beer bottles. oedipa located a full one and seated herself on the grass. "i would like to find 
out," she presently plunged, "something about the historical wharfinger. not so much the verbal one." 

"the historical shakespeare," growled one of the grad students through a full beard, uncapping another bottle. "the historical

 that truly belonged to 
them in their exile: the night. soon he had added to his iconography the muted post horn and a dead badger with its four 
feet in the air (some said that the name taxis came from the italian tasso, badger, referring to hats of badger fur the early 
bergamascan couriers wore). he began a sub rosa campaign of obstruction, terror and depredation along the thurn and taxis 
mail routes. 

oedipa spent the next several days in and out of libraries and earnest discussions with emory bortz and genghis cohen. 

she feared a little for their security in view of what was happening to everyone else she knew. the day after reading blobb's 
peregrinations she, with bortz, grace, and the graduate students, attended randolph driblette's burial, listened to a younger 
brother's helpless, stricken eulogy, watched the mother, spectral in afternoon smog, cry, and came back at night to sit on the 
grave and drink napa valley muscatel, which driblette in his time had put away barrels of. there

but as with maxwell's demon, so now. either she could not communicate, or he did not exist. 
beyond its origins, the libraries told her nothing more about tristero. for all they knew, it had never survived the 

struggle for dutch independence. to find the rest, she had to approach from the thum and taxis side. this had its perils. for 
emory bortz it seemed to turn into a species of cute game. he held, for instance, to a mirror-image theory, by which any period of 
instability for thum and taxis must have its reflection in tristero's shadow-state. he applied this to the mystery of why the 
dread name should have appeared in print only around the middle of the 17th century. how had the author of the pun on "this 
trystero dies irae" overcome his reluctance? how had half the vatican couplet, with its suppression of the "trystero" line,

 she drove back to san narciso to have another look at the 

list of inverarity's assets. sure enough, the whole shopping center that housed zapf's used books and tremaine's surplus 
place had been owned by pierce. not only that, but the tank theatre, 
also. 

ok, oedipa told herself, stalking around the room, her viscera hollow, waiting on something truly terrible, 

 

ok. it's unavoidable, isn't it? every access route to the tristero could be traced also back to the inverarity estate. even 
emory bortz, with his copy of blobb's peregrinations (bought, she had no doubt he'd tell her in the event she asked, also at 
zapf's), taught now at san narciso college, heavily endowed by the dead man. 

meaning what? that bortz, along with metzger, cohen, driblette, koteks, the tattooed sailor in san francisco, the 
w.a.s.t.e. carriers she'd seen—that all of them were pierce inverarity's men? bought? or loyal, for free, for fun, to some 
grandiose practical joke he'd cooked up, all for her embarrassmen

less excited than she might have been even a week ago, oedipa showed the piece to emory bortz. "all the tristero 

refugees from the 1849 reaction arrive in america," it seemed to him, "full of high hopes. only what do they find?" not really 
asking; it was part of his game. "trouble." around 1845 the u. s. government had carried out a great postal reform, cutting 
their rates, putting most independent mail routes out of business. by the 'yo's and '8o's, any independent carrier that tried to 
compete with the government was immediately squashed. 1849-50 was no time for any immigrating t
