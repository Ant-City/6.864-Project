Henry - 
      King of England at the beginning of the play, Henry is not a strong king; his nobles and his wife, Margaret, take advantage of him. Unable to live up to the legacy of his legendary father, Henry V, Henry loses all the English territories in France and cannot seem to control his warring nobles. In this play, he is twice thrust from the throne and twice imprisoned and once returned to place at the head of state. He flees battles and flees to Scotland but is always captured and brought back. Finally, he wishes to become a private citizen, desiring to be king in name only while other men rule. But in the end he is killed in prison by Richard.
