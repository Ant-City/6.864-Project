ught  they  would  go  to  church, 
but no, they held a special service in the pink house, and 
people  came  to  them.  it  was  a  group  called  the  
daughters of mary, which august had organized.

the daughters of mary started showing up in the 
parlor before 10:00 a.m. first was an old woman named 
queenie  and  her  grown  daughter,  violet.  they  were 
dressed  alike in  bright yellow  skirts  and white  blouses, 
though  they  wore  different  hats,  at  least.  next  came 
lunelle,  mabelee,  and  cressie,  who  wore  the  fanciest 
hats i'd ever laid eyes on. 

it turned out lunelle was a hatmaker without the 
least bit of shyness. i'm talking about purple felt the size 
of  a  sombrero  with  fake  fruit  on  the  back.  that  was 
lunelle's. 

mabelee  wore  a  creation  of  tiger  fur  wrapped 
with gold fringe, but it was cressie who carried the day 
in a  crimson smokestack with black netting and ostrich 
feathers. 

if this was not enough, they wore clip-on earbob

chanted. 

"they called her our lady of chains because she 
broke  them."  june  wedged  the  cello  between  her  legs 
and played "amazing grace," and the daughters of mary 
got  to  their  feet  and  swayed  together  like  colorful 
seaweed  on  the  ocean  floor.  i  thought  this  was  the 
grand  finale,  but  no,  june  switched  over  to  the  piano 
and banged out a jazzed-up version of "go tell it on the 
mountain." that's when august started a conga-line. she 
danced  over  to  lunelle,  who  latched  on  to  august's 
waist.  cressie  hooked  on  to  lunelle,  followed  by 
mabelee, and  off  they  went around the  room,  causing 
cressie to grab hold of her crimson hat. 

when  they  swung  back  by,  queenie  and  violet 
joined them, then sugar-girl.  i wanted  to be  part of it, 
too,  but  i only watched,  and  so  did rosaleen and otis. 
june seemed to play faster and faster. i fanned my face, 
trying to get a little air, feeling light-headed. when the 
dance  ended,

took  my  breath  away.  one  at  a  time  they  went  and  
touched the statue's fading red heart. 

queenie  and  her  daughter  went  together  and 
rubbed  their  palms  against  the  wood.  lunelle  pressed 
her  fingers  to  mary's  heart,  then  kissed  each  one  of 
them in a slow, deliberate way, a way that brought tears 
to my eyes. 

otis pressed his forehead to the heart, standing 
there the longest time of them all, head to heart, like he 
was filling up his empty tank. 

june kept playing while each of them came, until 
there  was  only  rosaleen  and  me  left.  may  nodded  to 
june  to  keep  on  with  the  music  and  took  rosaleen's 
hand,  pulling  her  to  our  lady  of

d.  the  last  time  i'd  seen 
them,  queenie  and  her  daughter,  violet,  had  on  the 
smallest hats in the group, and this time they'd left them 
off completely. i think it was because queenie hated to 
cover the whiteness of her hair, which she was proud to 
have, and violet, who had to be forty at least, couldn't 
bring herself to wear a hat if her mother wasn't wearing 
one.  if  queenie  went  into  the  kitchen  and  stuck  her 
head in the oven, violet would go stick hers in, too. 

lunelle,  mabelee,  cressie,  and  sugar-girl  each 
wore  a  black  hat,  not  as  spectacular  as  the  previous 
ones, except for lunelle's, which had both a red veil and 
a red feather. they took off the hats and lined them up 
on  the  piano  as  soon  as  they  came  in,  so  that  you  
wanted to say, what's the use? 

they got under way slicing ham, laying out fried 
chicken,  shaking  paprika  on  the  deviled  eggs.  we  had

checks cashed," said queenie. "people can drive through 
and  pay  their  respects  without having  to get  out.  they

even send the guest book out in the drawer for you to 
sign." 

"you ain't serious," said rosaleen. 
"oh, yeah," queenie said. "we're serious." 
they might've been speaking the truth, but they 
didn't  look  serious.  they  were  falling  on  each  other 
laughing, and there was may, dead. 

lunelle  said,  "i  drove  in  there  one  time  to  see  
mrs. lamar after she passed, since i used to work for her 
way  back  when.  the  woman  who  sat  in  the  window 
beside her casket used to be the bank teller there, and 
when i drove off, she said, 'you have a nice day now.'" 

i  turned  to  august,  who  was  wiping  her  eyes 
from  tears  of  hilarity.  i  said,  "you  won't  let  them  put  
may in the bank window, will you?" 

"honey,  don't  worry  about  it,"  said  sugar-girl.

the  daughters  fussed  over  me—how  good  i 
smelled,  how  exceptional  my  hair  was  when  it  was 
combed. 

lunelle said, "would you like me to make you a 

hat, lily?" 

"really? you'd make me a hat?" where i would 
wear a lunelle-created hat was a mystery, but i wanted 
one all the same. at the least, i could get buried in it one 
day. 

"of course i'll make you a hat. i'll make you a hat 

you won't believe. what color would you like?" 

august,  who  was  listening  in,  said,  "blue,"  and 

winked at me.

this  was  a  use  for  honey  i  hadn't  considered.  i  
could just see funeral homes selling big jars of honey for 
dead people, instead of coffins. i tried to picture that in 
the drive-through window at the funeral home. 

i began to work my hands into the wood, almost 

embarrassed at the intimacy of what we were doing. 

once mabelee leaned her head over too far and 
got honey all in her hair, but it was lunelle who took the

kept  trying  to  lick  it  off,  but  of  course  her  tongue  
couldn't reach that far. 

the ants started a single-file parade up the side 
of  our  lady,  drawn  by  the  honey,  and  not  to  be 
outdone, a handful of scout bees showed up and landed 
on our lady's head. let somebody bring out the honey 
and the insect kingdom will be there in no time.

 think. she breezed in holding a gold-and-
white-striped hatbox. she stood a moment looking down 
at me, seeming unusually tall. the fan on the little wall 
shelf rotated around and blew her collar, making it flap 
around her neck. 

she has brought me a hat, i thought. maybe she 
had  gone  down  to  the  amen  dollar  and  bought  me  a 
straw hat to cheer me up. but that didn't make a bit of 
sense, really. why would a straw hat cheer me up? then 
i thought for one second it might be the hat lunelle had 
promised  to  make  for  me,  but  that  didn't  fit  either.  
lunelle  wouldn't  have  had  time  to  sew  up  a  hat  this 
soon. 

august sat on rosaleen's old cot and placed the 

box on her lap. 

"i've  brought  you  some  of  your  mother's 

belongings."

walking  down  an  aisle  of  rose  petals,  wearing  a  white 
rayon  suit  with  frog  closings  that  mabelee  was  sewing 
for  her.  i  could  not  picture  frog  closings.  june  drew  a 
picture of one on a tablet, and afterward i still could not 
picture them. lunelle had been commissioned to make 
her a wedding hat, which i thought was very courageous 
of  june.  there  was  no  telling  what  she  would  end  up 
with on her head. 

rosaleen  offered  to  bake  the  wedding  cake 
layers, and violet and queenie were going to decorate it 
with a "rainbow theme." 

again, all i can say is how brave june was.

"i don't care where the hell you are or where you 

end up," he said to her. "but lily's coming with me." 

even as he said it, i could tell he didn't want me, 
didn't  want  me  back  on  the  farm,  didn't  want  to  be 
reminded of her. another part of him—the good part, if 
there was such a thing—might even be thinking that i'd 
be better off here. 

it  was  pride  now,  all  pride.  how  could  he  back

the  front  door  opened,  and  queenie,  violet, 
lunelle,  and  mabelee  stumbled  into  the  house,  all 
wound  up  and  looking  like  they  had  their  clothes  on 
backward. queenie stared at my cheek. 

"everybody all right?" she said, out of breath. 
"we're all right," said august. "this is mr. owens,

i wondered how we must look to him. a bunch of 
women—mabelee four foot ten, lunelle's hair standing 
straight  up  on  her  head  begging  to  be  braided,  violet 
muttering,  "blessed  mary,"  and  queenie—tough  old 
queenie—with her hands on her hips and her lip shoved 
out, every inch of her saying, i double-dog dare you to 
take this girl. 

t. ray sniffed hard and looked at the ceiling. his 
resolve  was  crumbling  all  around  him.  you  could 
practically see bits of it flaking off.

and  roebuck  catalog.  violet  and  queenie  donated  a 
flowered rug that had been laying around in their extra 
room  going  to  waste,  and  mabelee  sewed  blue-and-
white  polka  dot  curtains  for  the  windows  with  fringe 
balls along the hem. cressie crocheted four eight-legged 
octopuses out of various colors of yarn to sit on the bed. 
one  octopus  would  have  been  enough  for  me,  but  it's 
the only handicraft cressie knows how to do, so she just 
keeps doing it. 

lunelle created me a hat that outdid every other 
hat  she'd  ever  made,  including  june's  wedding  hat.  it 
reminds me a little of the pope's hat. it is tall, just goes 
up  into  the  air  and  keeps  going.  it  does  have  more  
roundness  than  the  pope's  hat,  however.  i  expected 
blue, but no, she sewed it in golds  and browns.  i think 
it's supposed to be an old-fashioned beehive. i only wear 
it  to  the  daughters  of  mary  meetings,  since  anywhere 
else it would stop traffic for
