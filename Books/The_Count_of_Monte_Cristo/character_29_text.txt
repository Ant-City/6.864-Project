mber it, do you not? then there is his
son, andrea, a charming young man, about your own age, viscount, bearing
the same title as yourself, and who is making his entry into the
parisian world, aided by his fatherâ€™s millions. the major will bring his
son with him this evening, the _contino_, as we say in italy; he
confides him to my care. if he proves himself worthy of it, i will do
what i can to advance his interests. you will assist me in the work,
will you not?â€

â€œmost undoubtedly. this major cavalcanti is an old friend of yours,
then?â€

â€œby no means. he is a perfect nobleman, very polite, modest, and
agreeable, such as may be found constantly in italy, descendants of very
ancient families. i have met him several times at florence, bologna and
lucca, and he has now communicated to me the fact of his arrival in
paris. the acquaintances one makes in travelling have a sort of claim on
one; they everywhere expect to receive the same attention which you once
paid them by chance, as though the c

likely to awaken any lasting interest in favor of the man in whose
society you may happen to be thrown in the course of your journey. this
good major cavalcanti is come to take a second view of paris, which he
only saw in passing through in the time of the empire, when he was on
his way to moscow. i shall give him a good dinner, he will confide his
son to my care, i will promise to watch over him, i shall let him follow
in whatever path his folly may lead him, and then i shall have done my
part.â€

â€œcertainly; i see you are a model mentor,â€ said albert â€œgood-bye, we
shall return on sunday. by the way, i have received news of franz.â€

e dinner.â€

â€œreally, my dear m. bertuccio,â€ said the count, â€œsince you have been in
paris, you have become quite nervous, and apparently out of your
element; you no longer seem to understand me.â€

â€œbut surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are
expecting to receive?â€

â€œi do not yet know myself, neither is it necessary that you should do
so. â€˜lucullus dines with lucullus,â€™ that is quite sufficient.â€ bertuccio
bowed, and left the room.



chapter 55. major cavalcanti

both the count and baptistin had told the truth when they announced to
morcerf the proposed visit of the major, which had served monte cristo
as a pretext for declining albertâ€™s invitation. seven oâ€™clock had just
struck, and m. bertuccio, according to the command which had been given
him, had two hours before left for auteuil, when a cab stopped at the
door, and after depositing its occupant at the gate, immediately hurried
away, as if ashamed of its employment. the visitor was about fifty

œno, certainly not.â€

â€œyou were sent by some other person?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œby the excellent abbÃ© busoni?â€

â€œexactly so,â€ said the delighted major.

â€œand you have a letter?â€

â€œyes, there it is.â€

â€œgive it to me, then;â€ and monte cristo took the letter, which he opened
and read. the major looked at the count with his large staring eyes, and
then took a survey of the apartment, but his gaze almost immediately
reverted to the proprietor of the room.

â€œyes, yes, i see. â€˜major cavalcanti, a worthy patrician of lucca, a
descendant of the cavalcanti of florence,â€™â€ continued monte cristo,
reading aloud, â€œâ€˜possessing an income of half a million.â€™â€

monte cristo raised his eyes from the paper, and bowed. â€œhalf a
million,â€ said he, â€œmagnificent!â€

â€œhalf a million, is it?â€ said the major.

â€œyes, in so many words; and it must be so, for the abbÃ© knows correctly
the amount of all the largest fortunes in europe.â€

â€œbe it half a million, then; but on my word

his self-possession.

â€œso, then,â€ said he, â€œthe letter was true to the end?â€

â€œdid you doubt it, my dear monsieur bartolomeo?â€

â€œno, indeed; certainly not; a good man, a man holding religious office,
as does the abbÃ© busoni, could not condescend to deceive or play off a
joke; but your excellency has not read all.â€

â€œah, true,â€ said monte cristo â€œthere is a postscript.â€

â€œyes, yes,â€ repeated the major, â€œyes--there--is--a--postscript.â€

â€œâ€˜in order to save major cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on his
banker, i send him a draft for 2,000 francs to defray his travelling
expenses, and credit on you for the further sum of 48,000 francs, which
you still owe me.â€™â€

the major awaited the conclusion of the postscript, apparently with
great anxiety.

â€œvery good,â€ said the count.

â€œhe said â€˜very good,â€™â€ muttered the major, â€œthen--sir----â€ replied he.

â€œthen what?â€ asked monte cristo.

â€œthen the postscript----â€

â€œwell; what of the postscript?

you, m. debray, in pacifying a kingdom; you, m. de chÃ¢teau-renaud, in
pleasing a woman; and you, morrel, in breaking a horse that no one can
ride. for example, you see these two fish; one brought from fifty
leagues beyond st. petersburg, the other five leagues from naples. is it
not amusing to see them both on the same table?â€

â€œwhat are the two fish?â€ asked danglars.

â€œm. chÃ¢teau-renaud, who has lived in russia, will tell you the name of
one, and major cavalcanti, who is an italian, will tell you the name of
the other.â€

â€œthis one is, i think, a sterlet,â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud.

â€œand that one, if i mistake not, a lamprey.â€

â€œjust so. now, m. danglars, ask these gentlemen where they are caught.â€

â€œsterlets,â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud, â€œare only found in the volga.â€

â€œand,â€ said cavalcanti, â€œi know that lake fusaro alone supplies lampreys
of that size.â€

â€œexactly; one comes from the volga, and the other from lake fusaro.â€

it was remorseful: it was remorseful because it concealed a crime.â€

â€œwho said it was a crime?â€ asked villefort, with a last effort.

â€œhow? is it not a crime to bury a living child in a garden?â€ cried monte
cristo. â€œand pray what do you call such an action?â€

â€œbut who said it was buried alive?â€

â€œwhy bury it there if it were dead? this garden has never been a
cemetery.â€

â€œwhat is done to infanticides in this country?â€ asked major cavalcanti
innocently.

â€œoh, their heads are soon cut off,â€ said danglars.

â€œah, indeed?â€ said cavalcanti.

â€œi think so; am i not right, m. de villefort?â€ asked monte cristo.

â€œyes, count,â€ replied villefort, in a voice now scarcely human.

monte cristo, seeing that the two persons for whom he had prepared this
scene could scarcely endure it, and not wishing to carry it too far,
said, â€œcome, gentlemen,--some coffee, we seem to have forgotten it,â€ and
he conducted the guests back to the

monte cristo had begged the smelling-bottle of madame de villefort, he
had noticed the approach of villefort to madame danglars, and he soon
guessed all that had passed between them, though the words had been
uttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by madame danglars.
without opposing their arrangements, he allowed morrel, chÃ¢teau-renaud,
and debray to leave on horseback, and the ladies in m. de villefortâ€™s
carriage. danglars, more and more delighted with major cavalcanti, had
offered him a seat in his carriage. andrea cavalcanti found his tilbury
waiting at the door; the groom, in every respect a caricature of the
english fashion, was standing on tiptoe to hold a large iron-gray horse.

andrea had spoken very little during dinner; he was an intelligent lad,
and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people,
amongst whom, with dilating eyes, he saw the kingâ€™s attorney. then he
had been seized upon by danglars, who, with a rapid glance at the st

â€œcome, come; i always said you were a fine fellow, and it is a blessing
when good fortune happens to such as you. but tell me all about it?â€

â€œwhy do you wish to know?â€ asked cavalcanti.

â€œwhat? do you again defy me?â€

â€œno; the fact is, i have found my father.â€

â€œwhat? a real father?â€

â€œyes, so long as he pays me----â€

â€œyouâ€™ll honor and believe him--thatâ€™s right. what is his name?â€

â€œmajor cavalcanti.â€

â€œis he pleased with you?â€

â€œso far i have appeared to answer his purpose.â€

â€œand who found this father for you?â€

â€œthe count of monte cristo.â€

â€œthe man whose house you have just left?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œah, true. well; i shall rent a room in some respectable house, wear a
decent coat, shave every day, and go and read the papers in a cafÃ©.
then, in the evening, i shall go to the theatre; i shall look like some
retired baker. that is what i want.â€

â€œcome, if you will only put this scheme into execution, and be steady,
nothing could be better.â€

â€œdo you think so, m. bossuet? and you--what will you become? a peer of
france?â€

â€œah,â€ said andrea, â€œwho knows?â€

â€œmajor cavalcanti is already one, perhaps; but then, hereditary rank is
abolished.â€

â€œno politics, caderousse. and now that you have all you want, and that
we understand each other, jump down from the tilbury and disappear.â€

â€œnot at all, my good friend.â€

â€œhow? not at all?â€

â€œwhy, just think for a moment; with this red handkerchief on my head,
with scarcely any shoes, no papers, and ten gold napoleons in my pocket,

justify myself, i should say that you gave me the money; this would
cause inquiries, it would be found that i left toulon without giving due
notice, and i should then be escorted back to the shores of the
mediterranean. then i should become simply no. 106, and good-bye to my
dream of resembling the retired baker! no, no, my boy; i prefer
remaining honorably in the capital.â€ andrea scowled. certainly, as he
had himself owned, the reputed son of major cavalcanti was a wilful
fellow. he drew up for a minute, threw a rapid glance around him, and
then his hand fell instantly into his pocket, where it began playing
with a pistol. but, meanwhile, caderousse, who had never taken his eyes
off his companion, passed his hand behind his back, and opened a long
spanish knife, which he always carried with him, to be ready in case of
need. the two friends, as we see, were worthy of and understood one
another. andreaâ€™s hand left his pocket inoffensively, and was c
