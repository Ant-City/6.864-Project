being looked upon with disfavour in the army, assigna-
tions and communications had probably been made
across the river before tonight.
"is it sergeant troy?" said the blurred spot in the
snow, tremulously.
this person was so much like a mere shade upon
the earth, and the other speaker so much a part of
the building, that one would have said the wall was
holding a conversation with the snow.
"yes." came suspiciously from the shadow." what
girl are you?"
"o, frank -- don't you know me?" said the spot.
"your wife, fanny robin."
"fanny!" said the wall, in utter astonishment.
"yes." said the girl, with a half-suppressed gasp of
emotion.
there was something in the woman's tone which is
not that of the wife, and there was a mannerin the man
which is rarely a husband's. the dialogue went on:
"how did you come here?"
"i asked which was your window. forgive me!"
"i did not expect you to-night. indeed, i did not
think you would come at all. it was a wo

"you said i was to come."
"well -- i said that you might."
"yes, i mean that i might. you are glad to see me,
frank?"
"o yes -- of course."
"can you -- come to me!"
my dear fan, no! the bugle has sounded, the
barrack gates are closed, and i have no leave. we are
all of us as good as in the county gaol till to-morrow
morning."
"then i shan't see you till then!" the words- were
in a faltering tone of disappointment.
"how did you get here from weatherbury?"
"i walked -- some part of the way -- the rest by the
carriers."
"i am surprised."
"yes -- so am i. and frank, when will it be?"
"what?"
"that

"i don't quite recollect."
"o you do! don't speak like that. it weighs me
to the earth. it makes me say what ought to be said
first by you."
"never mind -- say it."
"o, must i? -- it is, when shall we be married,
frank?"
"oh, i " see. well --  you have to get proper
clothes."
"i have money. will it be by banns or license?"
"banns, i should think."
"and we live in two parishes."
"do we? what then?"
"my lodgings are in st. mary's, and this is not. so
they will have to be published in both."
"is that the law?"
"yes. o frank -- you think me forward, i am
afraid! don't, dear frank -- will you -- for i love you so.
and you said lots of times you would marry me, and

"yes -- yes -- it is. it was wrong of me to worry you.

to the barracks. there are bad women about, and they
think me one."
"quite,so. i'll come to you, my dean good-night."
"good-night, frank -- good-night!"
and the noise was again heard of a window closing
the little spot moved away. when she passed the
corner a subdued exclamation was heard inside the
wall.
"ho -- ho -- sergeant -- ho -- ho!" an expostulation
followed, but it was indistinct; and it became lost amid
a low peal of laughter, which was hardly distinguishable
from the gurgle of the tiny whirlpools outside.

innocently enough; but the sound had a strange weird
effect in that place.
opposite to the church was a paved square, around
which several overhanging wood buildings of old time
cast a picturesque shade. the young man on leaving
the door went to cross the square, when, in the middle,
he met a little woman. the expression of her face,
which had been one of intense anxiety, sank at the
sight of his nearly to terror.
"well?" he said, in a suppressed passion, fixedly
looking at her.
"o, frank -- i made a mistake! -- i thought that
church with the spire was all saints', and i was at the
door at half-past eleven to a minute as you said.
waited till a quarter to twelve, and found then that i
was in all souls'. but i wasn't much frightened, for
i thought it could be to-morrow as well."
"you fool, for so fooling me! but say no more."
"shall it be to-morrow, frank?" she asked blankly.
"to-morrow!" and he gave vent to a hoarse laugh.

"but after all." she expostulated in a trembling voice,
"the mistake was not such a terrible thing! now, dear
frank, when shall it be?"
"ah, when? god knows!" he said, with a light
irony, and turning from her walked rapidly away.

"twill be a gallant life, but may bring some trouble
between the mirth -- so say i."
"well, i wish i had half such a husband."
bathsheba had too much sense to mind seriously
what her servitors said about her; but too much womanly
redundance of speech to leave alone what was said till
it died the natural death of unminded things. she
burst in upon them.
"who are you speaking of?" she asked.
there was a pause before anybody replied. at last
liddy said frankly," what was passing was a bit of a
word about yourself, miss."
"i thought so! maryann and liddy and temper-
ance -- now i forbid you to suppose such things. you
know i don't care the least for mr. troy -- not i. every-
body knows how much i hate him. -- yes." repeated the
froward young person, "hate him!"
"we know you do, miss." said liddy; "and so do we
all."
"i hate him too." said maryann.
"maryann -- o you perjured woman! how can you

"will you confine your words to that one point? --
shall i hear every word you say?"
"every word. now sit still there, and hold my"
carpet bag for me, and mark what you hear."
the light footstep came closer, halting occasionally,
as if the walker listened for a sound. troy whistled a
double note in a soft, fluty tone.
"come to that, is it!" murmured boldwood, uneasily.
"you promised silence." said troy.
"i promise again."
troy stepped forward.
"frank, dearest, is that you?" the tones were
bathsheba's.
"o god!" said boldwood.
"yes." said troy to her.
"how late you are." she continued, tenderly. "did
you come by the carrier? i listened and heard his
wheels entering the village, but it was some time ago,
and i had almost given you up, frank."
"i was sure to come." said frank. "you knew i
should, did you not?"
"well, i thought you would." she said, playfully;
"and, frank, it is so lucky! there's not a soul in my
house but me to-nigh

bathsheba put her hand upon his arm, and, with
upturned pale face, said imploringly," no -- don't give
it to them -- pray don't, frank! it will only do them
harm:  they have had enough of everything."
"true -- we don't wish for no more, thank ye." said
one or two.

her voice was painfully lowered from the fulness and
vivacity of the previous summer -- "that you have lost
more than a hundred pounds in a month by this
dreadful horse-racing? o, frank, it is cruel; it is
foolish of you to take away my money so. we shall
have to leave the farm; that will be the end of it!"

then came on towards his wife, stepped into the gig,
took the reins from her hand, and without making any
observation whipped the horse into a trot. he was
rather agitated.
"do you know who that woman was?" said bath-
sheba, looking searchingly into his face.
"i do." he said, looking boldly back into hers.
"i thought you did." said she, with angry hauteur,
and still regarding him. "who is she?"
he suddenly seemed to think that frankness would
benefit neither of the women.
"nothing to either of us." he said. "i know her
by sight."
"what is her name?"
"how should i know her name?"
"i think you do."
"think if you will, and be --  -- " the sentence was
completed by a smart cut of the whip round poppet's
flank, which caused the animal to start forward at a

"bathsheba, could you let me have twenty pounds?"
her countenance instantly sank." twenty pounds?
she said.
"the fact is, i want it badly." the anxiety upon
troy's face was unusual and very marked. lt was a
culmination of the mood he had been in all the day.
"ah! for those races to-morrow."
troy for the moment made no reply. her mistake
had its advantages to a man who shrank from having
his mind inspected as he did now. "well, suppose i
do want it for races?" he said, at last.
"o, frank!" bathsheba replied, and there was such
a volume of entreaty in the words. "only such a few
weeks ago you said that i was far sweeter than all your
other pleasures put together, and that you would give
them all up for me; and now, won't you give up this
one, which is more a worry than a pleasure? do,
frank. come, let me fascinate you by all i can do

can think of -- to stay at home. say yes to your wife --

entreaty of the beautiful
face, thrown a little back and sideways in the well
known attitude that expresses more than the words it
accompanies, and which seems to have been designed
for these special occasions. had the woman not been
his wife, troy would have succumbed instantly; as it
was, he thought he would not deceive her longer.
"the money is not wanted for racing debts at all,"
he said.
"what is it for?" she asked. "you worry me a great
deal by these mysterious responsibilities, frank."
troy hesitated. he did not now love her enough
to allow himself to be carried too far by her ways. yet
it was necessary to be civil. "you wrong me by such
a suspicious manner, he said. "such strait-waistcoating
as you treat me to is not becoming in you at so early a
date."
"i think that i have a right to grumble a little if i
pay." she said, with features between a smile and a
pout.

"not you -- only your faults. i do hate them."
"'twould be much more becoming if you set your-
self to cure them. come, let's strike a balance with
the twenty pounds, and be friends."
she gave a sigh of resignation. "i have about that
sum here for household expenses. if you must have it,
take it."
"very good. thank you. i expect i shall have
gone away before you are in to breakfast to-morrow."
"and must you go? ah! there was a time, frank,
when it would have taken a good many promises to
other people to drag you away from me. you used to
call me darling, then. but it doesn't matter to you how
my days are passed now."
"i must go, in spite of sentiment." troy, as he
spoke, looked at his watch, and, apparently actuated by
non lucendo principles, opened the case at the back,
revealing, snugly stowed within it, a small coil of hair.
bathsheba's eyes had been accidentally lifted at that
moment, and she saw the action and saw

flushed in pain and surprise, and some words escaped
her before she had thought whether or not it was wise
to utter them. "a woman's curl of hair!" she said.
"o, frank, whose is that?"
troy had instantly closed his watch. he carelessly
replied, as one who cloaked some feelings that the sight
had stirred." why, yours, of course. whose should it
be? i had quite forgotten that i had it."
"what a dreadful fib, frank!"
"i tell you i had forgotten it!" he said, loudly.
"i don't mean that -- it was yellow hair."
"nonsense."
"that's insulting me. i know it was yellow. now
whose was it? i want to know."
"very well i'll tell you, so make no more ado. it
is the hair of a young woman i was going to marry
before i knew you."
"you ought to tell me her name, then."
"i cannot do that."
"is she married yet?"
"no."
"is she alive?"
"yes."
"is she pretty?"
"yes."

i would have died for you -- how truly i can say that i
would have died for you! and now you sneer at my
foolishness in marrying you. o! is it kind to me to
throw my mistake in my face? whatever opinion you
may have of my wisdom, you should not tell me of it so
mercilessly, now that i am in your power."
"i can't help how things fall out." said troy; "upon
my heart, women will be the death of me!"
"well you shouldn't keep people's hair. you'll
burn it, won't you, frank?"
frank went on as if he had not heard her. "there
are considerations even before my consideration for you;
reparations to be made -- ties you know nothing of if
you repent of marrying, so do i."
trembling now, she put her hand upon his arm,
saying, in mingled tones of wretchedness and coaxing,
"i only repent it if you don't love me better than any
woman in the world! i don't otherwise, frank. you
don't repent because you already love somebody better
than you love me, do you?"

that i am ready to swear."
"but just now you said "ties;" and then -- that
woman we met?"
"'twas the meeting with her that reminded me of
the hair."
"is it hers, then?"
"yes. there, now that you have wormed it out of
me, i hope you are content."
"and what are the ties?"
"oh! that meant nothing -- a mere jest."
"a mere jest!" she said, in mournful astonishment.
"can you jest when i am so wretchedly in earnest?
tell me the truth, frank. i am not a fool, you know,
although i am a woman, and have my woman's moments.
come! treat me fairly." she said, looking honestly and
fearlessly into his face. "i don't want much; bare
justice -- that's all! ah! once i felt i could be content
with nothing less than the highest homage from the
husband i should choose. now, anything short of
cruelty will content me. yes! the independent and

her indignant mood a little earlier, when she had
meditated upon compromised honour, forestalment,
eclipse in maternity by another, was violent and entire.
all that was forgotten in the simple and still strong
attachment of wife to husband. she had sighed for
her self-completeness then, and now she cried aloud
against the severance of the union she had deplored.
she flung her arms round troy's neck, exclaiming wildly
from the deepest deep of her heart --
"don't -- don't kiss them! o, frank, i can"t bear
it-i can't! i love you better than she did: kiss me
too, frank -- kiss me! you will, frank, kiss me too!"
there was something so abnormal and startling in
the childlike pain and simplicity of this appeal from a
woman of bathsheba's calibre and independence, that
troy, loosening her tightly clasped arms from his neck,
looked at her in bewilderment. it was such and unex-

and she told him how she had again got into the toils;
what boldwood had asked her, and how he was ex-
pecting her assent. "the most mournful reason of all
for my agreeing to it." she said sadly, "and the true
reason why i think to do so for good or for evil, is this
 -- it is a thing i have not breathed to a living soul as
yet-i believe that if i don't give my word, he'll go out
of his mind."
"really, do ye?" said gabriel, gravely.
"i believe this." she continued, with reckless frank-
ness; "and heaven knows i say it in a spirit the very
reverse of vain, for i am grieved and troubled to my
soul about it-i believe i hold that man's future in my
hand. his career depends entirely upon my treatment
of him. o gabriel, i tremble at my responsibility, for
it is terrible!"
"well, i think this much, ma'am, as i told you years
ago." said oak, "that his life is a total blank whenever

"i'm afraid there's a hitch in that argument." said
oak, with a grave smile.
she did not reply at once, and then saying, "good

she had spoken frankly, and neither asked nor ex-

that she had obtained. yet in the centremost parts of
her complicated heart there existed at this minute a
little pang of disappointment, for a reason she would
not allow herself to recognize. oak had not once
wished her free that he might marry her himself -- had
not once said, "i could wait for you as well as he."
that was the insect sting. not that she would have
listened to any such hypothesis. o no -
