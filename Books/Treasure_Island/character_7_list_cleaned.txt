[CHARACTER]	  - 
                a
former pirate marooned on treasure island. flint's pirate crew left
[CHARACTER] on the island for three years. ben's solitude has left
him somewhat deranged, and he has the appearance of a wild man.
he represents a degradation of the human spirit, yet his experience
has left him morally superior to the pirates. he is the only character
to be reformed, as he shifts sides from the pirates to the good
men, willingly helping jim and livesey. ben's uncanny imitations
of the dead pirate flint's voice suggest that he is a kind of a
ghost of a pirate.
