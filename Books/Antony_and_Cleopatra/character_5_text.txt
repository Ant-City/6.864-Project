 let our officers
have notice what we purpose. i shall break
the cause of our expedience to the queen,
and get her leave to part. for not alone
the death of fulvia, with more urgent touches,
do strongly speak to us; but the letters too
of many our contriving friends in rome
petition us at home: sextus pompeius
hath given the dare to caesar, and commands
the empire of the sea; our slippery people,--
whose love is never link'd to the deserver
till his deserts are past,--begin to throw
pompey the great, and all his dignities,
upon his son; who, high in name and power,
higher than both in blood and life, stands up
for the main soldier: whose quality, going on,
the sides o' the world may danger: much is breeding
which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life
and not a serpent's poison. say, our pleasure
to such whose place is under us, requires
our quick remove from hence.

hear me, queen:
the strong necessity of time commands
our services awhile; but my full heart
remains in use with you. our italy
shines o'er with civil swords:  sextus pompeius
makes his approaches to the port of rome;
equality of two domestic powers
breed scrupulous faction: the hated, grown to strength,
are newly grown to love: the condemn'd pompey,
rich in his father's honour, creeps apace
into the hearts of such as have not thriv'd
upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;
and quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge
by any desperate change. my more particular,
and that which most with you should safe my going,
is fulvia's death.

thy biddings have been done; and every hour,

how 'tis abroad. pompey is strong at sea;

that only have fear'd caesar: to the ports
the discontents repair, and men's reports
give him much wrong'd.

it hath been taught us from the primal state

menecrates and menas, famous pirates,
make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound
with keels of every kind: many hot inroads
they make in italy; the borders maritime
lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt:
no vessel can peep forth but 'tis as soon
taken as seen; for pompey's name strikes more
than could his war resisted.

caesar.

leave thy lascivious wassails. when thou once
was beaten from modena, where thou slew'st
hirtius and pansa, consuls, at thy heel
did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,
though daintily brought up, with patience more
than savages could suffer: thou didst drink
the stale of horses, and the gilded puddle
which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign
the roughest berry on the rudest hedge;

lepidus.

let me request you off: our graver business
frowns at this levity.--gentle lords, let's part;
you see we have burnt our cheeks: strong enobarb
is weaker than the wine; and mine own tongue

new wars 'gainst pompey; made his will, and read it

spoke scandy of me: when perforce he could not

there's strange news come, sir.

enobarbus.
what, man?

eros.
caesar and lepidus have made wars upon pompey.

enobarbus.
this is old: what is the success?

eros.
caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst pompey,
presently denied him rivality; would not let him partake in the
glory of the action: and not resting here, accuses him of letters
he had formerly wrote to pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him:
so the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.

enobarbus.

canidius.
ay, and to wage this battle at pharsalia,
where caesar fought with pompey. but these offers,
which serve not for his vantage, he shakes off;
and so should you.

enobarbus.
your ships are not well mann'd:
your mariners are muleteers, reapers, people
ingross'd by swift impress; in caesar's fleet

cleopatra.
good my lord,--

antony.
you have been a boggler ever:--
but when we in our viciousness grow hard,--
o misery on't!--the wise gods seal our eyes;
in our own filth drop our clear judgments: make us
adore our errors; laugh at's while we strut
to our confusion.

cleopatra.
o, is't come to this?

antony.
i found you as a morsel cold upon
dead caesar's trencher; nay, you were a fragment
of cneius pompey's; besides what hotter hours,
unregist'red in vulgar fame, you have
luxuriously pick'd out:--for i am sure,
though you can guess what temperance should be,
you know not what it is.

cleopatra.
wherefore is this?

antony.

and say 'god quit you!' be familiar with
