the [CHARACTER] - 
the unnamed protagonist of surfacing. the [CHARACTER]
is reverential toward nature, intensely private, anti-american, and
introspective. she works as a freelance artist. she searches for her missing
father on a remote island in quebec along with her boyfriend, joe, and her
friends, david and anna. socially alienated and distrustful of love, the
[CHARACTER] suffers a debilitating emotional numbness that eventually fixes itself
through a grand psychological transformation. she eventually goes mad on the
island. for a time she lives like an animal, but she eventually emerges as a
more enlightened being. surfacing is composed entirely of the
[CHARACTER]'s unfiltered thoughts and observations.
