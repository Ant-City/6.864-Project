ï¿½old metal,ï¿½ said tom.

ï¿½i judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away
more time hunting up six bitsï¿½ worth of old iron to sell to the foundry
than they would to make twice the money at regular work. but thatï¿½s
human nature--hurry along, hurry along!ï¿½

the boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.

ï¿½never mind; youï¿½ll see, when we get to the widow douglasï¿½.ï¿½

huck said with some apprehension--for he was long used to being falsely
accused:

ï¿½mr. jones, we havenï¿½t been doing nothing.ï¿½

the welshman laughed.

ï¿½well, i donï¿½t know, huck, my boy. i donï¿½t know about that. ainï¿½t you
and the widow good friends?ï¿½

ï¿½yes. well, sheï¿½s ben good friends to me, anyway.ï¿½

ï¿½all right, then. what do you want to be afraid for?ï¿½

this question was not entirely answered in huckï¿½s slow mind before he
found himself pushed, along with tom, into mrs. douglasï¿½ drawing-room.
mr. jones left the wagon near the door and followed.

in the village was there. the thatchers were there, the harpers, the
rogerses, aunt polly, sid, mary, the minister, the editor, and a great
many more, and all dressed in their best. the widow received the boys
as heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings. they
were covered with clay and candle-grease. aunt polly blushed crimson
with humiliation, and frowned and shook her head at tom. nobody suffered
half as much as the two boys did, however. mr. jones said:

ï¿½tom wasnï¿½t at home, yet, so i gave him up; but i stumbled on him and
huck right at my door, and so i just brought them along in a hurry.ï¿½

ï¿½and you did just right,ï¿½ said the widow. ï¿½come with me, boys.ï¿½

she took them to a bedchamber and said:

ï¿½now wash and dress yourselves. here are two new suits of
clothes--shirts, socks, everything complete. theyï¿½re huckï¿½s--no, no
thanks, huck--mr. jones bought one and i the other. but theyï¿½ll fit both
of you. get into them. we

say--ainï¿½t this grease and clay, on your clothes?ï¿½

ï¿½now, mr. siddy, you jist ï¿½tend to your own business. whatï¿½s all this
blowout about, anyway?ï¿½

ï¿½itï¿½s one of the widowï¿½s parties that sheï¿½s always having. this time
itï¿½s for the welshman and his sons, on account of that scrape they
helped her out of the other night. and say--i can tell you something, if
you want to know.ï¿½

ï¿½well, what?ï¿½

ï¿½why, old mr. jones is going to try to spring something on the people
here tonight, but i overheard him tell auntie today about it, as a
secret, but i reckon itï¿½s not much of a secret now. everybody knows--the
widow, too, for all she tries to let on she donï¿½t. mr. jones was bound
huck should be here--couldnï¿½t get along with his grand secret without
huck, you know!ï¿½

ï¿½secret about what, sid?ï¿½

ï¿½about huck tracking the robbers to the widowï¿½s. i reckon mr. jones was
going to make a grand time over his

did not finish her sentence. tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the
table and said:

ï¿½there--what did i tell you? half of itï¿½s huckï¿½s and half of itï¿½s mine!ï¿½

the spectacle took the general breath away. all gazed, nobody spoke for
a moment. then there was a unanimous call for an explanation. tom said
he could furnish it, and he did. the tale was long, but brimful of
interest. there was scarcely an interruption from any one to break the
charm of its flow. when he had finished, mr. jones said:

ï¿½i thought i had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion, but it
donï¿½t amount to anything now. this one makes it sing mighty small, iï¿½m
willing to allow.ï¿½

the money was counted. the sum amounted to a little over twelve thousand
dollars. it was more than any one present had ever seen at one time
before, though several persons were there who were worth considerably
more than that in property.
