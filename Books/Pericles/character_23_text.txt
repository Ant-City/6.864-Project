on ember-eves and holy-ales;
and lords and ladies in their lives

lord, but think
your grace, that fed my country with your corn,
for which the people's prayers still fall upon you,
must in your child be thought on.  if neglection
should therein make me vile, the common body,
by you relieved, would force me to my duty:
but if to that my nature need a spur,
the gods revenge it upon me and mine,
to the end of generation!

pericles.
i believe you;
your honour and your goodness teach me to 't,
without your vows. till she be married, madam,
by bright diana, whom we honour, all
unscissar'd shall this hair of mine remain,
though i show ill in 't.  so i take my leave
good madam, make me blessed in your care
in bringing up my child.

madam, this letter, and some certain jewels,

thaisa.
it is my lord's.
that i was shipp'd at sea, i well remember,
even on my eaning time; but whether there

i cannot rightly say.  but since king pericles,
my wedded lord, i ne'er shall see again,
a vestal livery will i take me to,
and never more have joy.

cerimon.
madam, if this you purpose as ye speak,
diana's temple is not distant far,
where you may abide till your date expire.
moreover, if you please, a niece of mine
shall there attend you.

my recompense is thanks, that's all;
yet my good will is great, though the gift small.
