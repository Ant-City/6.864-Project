did she divulge her clerical romance. when she
had first returned to her country there had been a pagan, swinburnian
young man in asheville, for whose passionate kisses and unsentimental
conversations she had taken a decided penchant--they had discussed
the matter pro and con with an intellectual romancing quite devoid of
sappiness. eventually she had decided to marry for background, and the
young pagan from asheville had gone through a spiritual crisis, joined
the catholic church, and was now--monsignor darcy.

“indeed, mrs. blaine, he is still delightful company--quite the
cardinal’s right-hand man.”

“amory will go to him one day, i know,” breathed the beautiful lady,
“and monsignor darcy will understand him as he understood me.”

amory became thirteen, rather tall and slender, and more than ever on to
his celtic mother. he had tutored occasionally--the idea being that he
was to “keep up,” at each place “taking up the work where he left off,”
 yet as no tutor ever found the p

“my regret is that you haven’t been abroad, but still, as you are a man,
it’s better that you should grow up here under the snarling eagle--is
that the right term?”

amory agreed that it was. she would not have appreciated the japanese
invasion.

“when do i go to school?”

“next month. you’ll have to start east a little early to take your
examinations. after that you’ll have a free week, so i want you to go up
the hudson and pay a visit.”

“to who?”

“to monsignor darcy, amory. he wants to see you. he went to harrow and
then to yale--became a catholic. i want him to talk to you--i feel he
can be such a help--” she stroked his auburn hair gently. “dear amory,

six suits winter underwear, one sweater or t shirt, one jersey, one
overcoat, winter, etc.,” set out for new england, the land of schools.

the metropolis, barely glimpsed, made little impression on him, except
for the sense of cleanliness he drew from the tall white buildings seen
from a hudson river steamboat in the early morning. indeed, his mind was
so crowded with dreams of athletic prowess at school that he considered
this visit only as a rather tiresome prelude to the great adventure.
this, however, it did not prove to be.

monsignor darcy’s house was an ancient, rambling structure set on a hill
overlooking the river, and there lived its owner, between his trips to
all parts of the roman-catholic world, rather like an exiled stuart king
waiting to be called to the rule of his land. monsignor was forty-four
then, and bustling--a trifle too stout for symmetry, with hair the color
of spun gold, and a brilliant, enveloping personality. when he came into
a room clad in his full purple regalia from thatch to toe, he resembled

mother’s dignified, reticent attitude diverted him, and he looked at the
funeral with an amused tolerance. he decided that burial was after all
preferable to cremation, and he smiled at his old boyhood choice,
slow oxidation in the top of a tree. the day after the ceremony he
was amusing himself in the great library by sinking back on a couch in
graceful mortuary attitudes, trying to determine whether he would, when
his day came, be found with his arms crossed piously over his chest
(monsignor darcy had once advocated this posture as being the most
distinguished), or with his hands clasped behind his head, a more pagan
and byronic attitude.

what interested him much more than the final departure of his father
from things mundane was a tri-cornered conversation between beatrice,
mr. barton, of barton and krogman, their lawyers, and himself, that took
place several days after the funeral. for the first time he came into
actual cognizance of the family finances, and realized what a tidy

first appearance of the term “personage”

monsignor darcy invited amory up to the stuart palace on the hudson for
a week at christmas, and they had enormous conversations around the open
fire. monsignor was growing a trifle stouter and his personality had
expanded even with that, and amory felt both rest and security in
sinking into a squat, cushioned chair and joining him in the middle-aged
sanity of a cigar.

“i’ve felt like leaving college, monsignor.”

“why?”

“all my career’s gone up in smoke; you think it’s petty and all that,

t. he felt like
a factory-owner who after accusing a clerk of dishonesty finds that his
own son, in the office, is changing the books once a week. his poor,
mistreated will that he had been holding up to the scorn of himself and
his friends, stood before him innocent, and his judgment walked off to
prison with the unconfinable imp, imagination, dancing in mocking glee
beside him. clara’s was the only advice he ever asked without dictating
the answer himself--except, perhaps, in his talks with monsignor darcy.

how he loved to do any sort of thing with clara! shopping with her was a
rare, epicurean dream. in every store where she had ever traded she was
whispered about as the beautiful mrs. page.

“i’ll bet she won’t stay single long.”

“well, don’t scream it out. she ain’t lookin’ for no advice.”

“_ain’t_ she beautiful!”

   (enter a floor-walker--silence till he moves forward, smirking.)

“society person, ain’t she?”

“yeah, but poor now, i guess; so they say.”

interlude

may, 1917-february, 1919


a letter dated january, 1918, written by monsignor darcy to amory, who
is a second lieutenant in the 171st infantry, port of embarkation, camp
mills, long island.


my dear boy:

all you need tell me of yourself is that you still are; for the rest i
merely search back in a restive memory, a thermometer that records only
fevers, and match you with what i was at your age. but men will chatter
and you and i will still shout our futilities to each other across
the stage until the last silly curtain falls _plump!_ upon our bobbing
heads. but you are start

lse about it.
there is no more dangerous gift to posterity than a few cleverly turned
platitudes.

tom, why don’t you become a catholic? of course to be a good one you’d
have to give up those violent intrigues you used to tell me about,
but you’d write better poetry if you were linked up to tall golden
candlesticks and long, even chants, and even if the american priests are
rather burgeois, as beatrice used to say, still you need only go to the
sporty churches, and i’ll introduce you to monsignor darcy who really is
a wonder.

kerry’s death was a blow, so was jesse’s to a certain extent. and i have
a great curiosity to know what queer corner of the world has swallowed
burne. do you suppose he’s in prison under some false name? i confess
that the war instead of making me orthodox, which is the correct
reaction, has made me a passionate agnostic. the catholic church has had
its wings clipped so often lately that its part was timidly negligible,
and they haven’t any good writers any more

industry. there was the eternal kissable mouth, small, slightly sensual,
and utterly disturbing. there were gray eyes and an unimpeachable skin
with two spots of vanishing color. she was slender and athletic, without
underdevelopment, and it was a delight to watch her move about a room,
walk along a street, swing a golf club, or turn a “cartwheel.”

a last qualification--her vivid, instant personality escaped that
conscious, theatrical quality that amory had found in isabelle.
monsignor darcy would have been quite up a tree whether to call her
a personality or a personage. she was perhaps the delicious,
inexpressible, once-in-a-century blend.

on the night of her debut she is, for all her strange, stray wisdom,
quite like a happy little girl. her mother’s maid has just done her
hair, but she has decided impatiently that she can do a better job
herself. she is too nervous just now to stay in one place. to that
we owe her presence in this littered room. she is going to speak.

 mackenzie, chesterton, galsworthy, bennett, had sunk in his
appreciation from sagacious, life-saturated geniuses to merely diverting
contemporaries. shaw’s aloof clarity and brilliant consistency and the
gloriously intoxicated efforts of h. g. wells to fit the key of romantic
symmetry into the elusive lock of truth, alone won his rapt attention.

he wanted to see monsignor darcy, to whom he had written when he landed,
but he had not heard from him; besides he knew that a visit to monsignor
would entail the story of rosalind, and the thought of repeating it
turned him cold with horror.

in his search for cool people he remembered mrs. lawrence, a very
intelligent, very dignified lady, a convert to the church, and a great
devotee of monsignor’s.

two glasses of sauterne at luncheon loosened his tongue, and he talked,
with what he felt was something of his old charm, of religion and
literature and the menacing phenomena of the social order. mrs. lawrence
was ostensibly pleased with him, and her interest was especially in his
mind; he wanted people to like his mind again--after a while it might be
such a nice place in which to live.

“monsignor darcy still thinks that you’re his reincarnation, that your
faith will eventually clarify.”

“perhaps,” he assented. “i’m rather pagan at present. it’s just that
religion doesn’t seem to have the slightest bearing on life at my age.”

when he left her house he walked down riverside drive with a feeling
of satisfaction. it was amusing to discuss again such subjects as this
young poet, stephen vincent benet, or the irish republic. between

another ending

in mid-august came a letter from monsignor darcy, who had evidently just
stumbled on his address:


my dear boy:--

your last letter was quite enough to make me worry about you. it was
not a bit like yourself. reading between the lines i should imagine that
your engagement to this girl is making you rather unhappy, and i see you
have lost all the feeling of romance that you had before the war. you
make a great mistake if you think you can be romantic without religion.

ination brought to the door of his forties--amory had wanted her
youth, the fresh radiance of her mind and body, the stuff that she was
selling now once and for all. so far as he was concerned, young rosalind
was dead.

a day later came a crisp, terse letter from mr. barton in chicago, which
informed him that as three more street-car companies had gone into
the hands of receivers he could expect for the present no further
remittances. last of all, on a dazed sunday night, a telegram told him
of monsignor darcy’s sudden death in philadelphia five days before.

he knew then what it was that he had perceived among the curtains of the
room in atlantic city.
