taking where he should not.'

and wang lung seized eagerly on what she said be-
cause it seemed to him he could not endure his life .any
more with all the trouble there was in his house, and so
he said:

£ it is a good thought.'

and he bade cuckoo go and ask the cousin what slave
he would have since he had seen them all.

so cuckoo did, then, and she came back and she said:

'he says he will have the little pale one who sleeps on
the bed of the mistress.'

now this pale slave was called pear blossom and the
one wang lung had bought in a famine year when she
was small and piteous and half-starved, and because she

267



was delicate always they had petted her and allowed her
only to help cuckoo and to do the lesser things about i
lotus, filling her pipe and pouring her tea, and it was thus i
the cousin had seen her.

now when pear blossom heard this she cried out as
she poured the tea for lotus, for cuckoo said it all out
before them in the inner court where they sat, and she
dropped the p

not satisfied.

and she was jealous of the maid and she sent her from
the room when wang lung came in and she accused wang
lung that he looked at the maid. now wang lung had
not thought of the girl except as a poor small child who
was frightened and he cared as he might care for his poor
fool and no more. but when lotus accused him he took
thought to look and he saw it was true that the girl was
very pretty and pale as a pear blossom, and seeing this,
something stirred in his old blood that had been quiet
these ten years and more.

so while he laughed at lotus saying: 'what — are_y.au
thinking i am still a-lust, when i do not come into your
room thrice a year?' yet he looked sidelong at the girl
and he was stirred.

now lotus, for all she was ignorant in all ways except
the one, was learned in the way of men with women and
she knew that men when they are old will wake once again
to a brief youth, and so she was angry with

then as though he remembered something he had forgotten,
he suddenly broke from his dignity and his arms dropped
and he said in his usual voice, 'besides, there never were
an uglier set of slaves than we have. if i cared— but i do
not — well, there is not a beauty in the courts except per-
haps the little pale maid who wait§ on the one in the inner
courts.'

then wang knew he spoke of pear blossom and he
was smitten with a strange jealousy. he suddenly felt
himself older than he was — -a man old and too thick of
girth and with whitening hair, and he saw his son a man
slim and young, and it was, in for this moment, father and
son, but two men, one old and one young, and wang
lung said angrily:

'now keep off the slaves — i will not have the rotten
ways of young lords in my house. we are good stout
country folk and people with decent ways, and none of
this in my house!'

then the boy o

hen he turned away and
went out.

then wang lung sat there alone in his room by his table
and he felt dreary and alone, and he muttered to himself :

'well, and i have no peace anywhere in my house.'

he was confused with many angers, but, although he
could not understand why, this anger stood forth most
clearly; his son had looked on a little pale young maid in
the house and had found her fair.

wang lung could not cease from his thought
of what his youngest son had said of pear blossom, and he
watched the maid incessantly as she came and went and
without his knowing it the thought of her filled his mind
and he doted on her. but he said nothing to any one.

one night in the early summer of that year, at the time
when the night air is thick and soft with the mists of
warmth and fragrance, he sat in his own court alone under
a flowering cassia tree and the sweet heavy scent of the
cassia flowers filled his nostrils and he sat there and his
blood ran full and hot like the blood o

ab and yet he could
not but feel the pain.

and so the day passed very long and lonely for him.

when night came he was still alone and he sat in his
court alone and there was not one in all his house to
whom he could go as friend. and the night air was
thick and soft and hot with the smell of the flowers of the
cassia tree.

and as he sat there in the darkness under the tree one
passed beside where he was sitting near the gate of his
court where the tree stood, and he looked quickly and
it was pear blossom.

tear blossom!' he called, and his voice came in a
whisper.

she stopped suddenly, her head bent in listening.
then he called again and his voice would scarcely come
from his throat:

'come here to me!'

then hearing him she crept fearfully through the gate
and stood before him and he could scarcely see her standing
there in the blackness, but he could feel her there and he
put out his hand and laid hold of her little coat and he said,
half choking:

'child !'

there he stopped with the word. 
 
 ___________________________
 
 but aloud he could not say it, because he

might put the thought into her mind, and he could not
bear it.

but she said:

'young men are not kind — they are only fierce.'

and hearing her small childish voice quavering up from
about his feet his heart welled up in a great wave of love
for this maid, and he took her and raised her gently, and
then he led her into his own courts.

when it was done, this love of his age astonished him
more than of any his lusts before, for with all his love for
pear blossom he did not seize upon her as he had seized
upon the others whom he had known.

no, he held her gently and he was satisfied to feel her
light youth against his heavy old flesh, and he was satisfied
merely with the sight of her in the day and with the touch
of her fluttering coat against his hand and with the quiet
resting of her body near him in the night. and he wondered
at the love of old age, which is so fond and so easily
satisfied.

as for her, she was a passionless maid and she clung
to hi

 for it.'

so cuckoo, still laughing and shaking her head, promised,
and wang lung went back to his court and he would
not come forth for a while until cuckoo came back and
said:

'well, and the thing is told, and she was angry enough
until i reminded her she wanted and has wanted this long
time the foreign clock you promised her, and she will have
a ruby ring for her hand and a pair so that there will be
one on each hand, and she will have other things as she
thinks of them and a slave to take pear blossom's place,
and pear blossom is not to come to her any more, and
you are not to come soon either, because the sight of you
sickens her.'

and wang lung promised eagerly and he said:

'get her what she wills and i do not begrudge anything.'

and he was pleased that he need not see lotus soon
and until anger was cooled with the fulfilment of her wishes.

there were left yet his three sons, and he was strangely
ashamed before them of what he had done. and he said
to himself again and again :

'am i n

the grain markets and he had much money let out at high
interest that his second son collected for him, and he looked
no more to see how the skies were over his land.7

but the second son talked on thus, and as he talked
. he looked here and there about the rooms with his eyes
veiled and secret and wang lung knew that he looked for
the maid to see if what he had heard was true, and so he
called pear blossom from wheje she hid in the bedroom,
and he called out:
t> 'bring me tea, my child, and tea for my son!'

and she came out, and her delicate pale face was rosy
as a peach and she hung her head and crept about on her
little silent feet, and the second son stared at her as if he
had heard but could not believe until now.

but he said nothing at all except that the land was thus
and so, and this tenant and that must be changed at the
end of the year, and the other one, because he smoked
opium and wo

sked his son how his children
did, and he answered they had the hundred day's cough,
but it was a slight thing now that the weather was warm.

this they talked back and forth, drinking tea, and the
second son took his fill of what he saw and he went away,
and wang lung was eased of his second son.

then the eldest son came in before the same day was
half over and he came in tall and handsome and proud
with the years of his maturity, and wang lung was afraid
of his pride, and he did not call out pear blossom at firsts
but he waited and smoked his pipe. the eldest son sat there
then stiff with his pride and his dignity and he asked after
the proper manner for his father's health and for his welfare.
then wang lung answered quickly and quietly that he
was well, and as he looked at his son his fear went out i
of him.

for he saw his eldest for what he was: a man big in
body but afraid of his own town wife and more afraid
of not appearing nobly born than of anything. and the
robustness of the land that

 was strong in wang lung even
when he did not know it swelled up in him, and he was i
careless again of this eldest son as he had been before, s

and careless of his proper looks, and he called easily of a
sudden to pear blossom:

'come, my child, and pour out tea again for another
son of mine!'

this time she came out very cold and still and her small
oval face was white as the flower of her name. her eyes
dropped as she came in and she moved stilly and did only
what she was told to do and she went quickly out again.

now the two men had sat silent while she poured the
tea, but when she was gone and they lifted their bowls,
wang lung looked fully into his son's eyes, and he caught
there a naked look of admiration, and
 
 ___________________________
 
he had hold the leash and some day the
man would come forth again.

then the eldest son said no more but he went his way
as a man does wkc> has had a new thought put into his
head. and wang lung sat and smoked his pipe and he was
proud of himself that when he was an old man he had-
done what he wished.

but it was night before the youngest son came in and
he also came alone. now wang lung sat in his middle
room on the court and the red candles were lit on the
table and he sat there smoking, and pear blossom sat silently
on the other side of the table from him, and her hands
were folded and quiet in her lap. sometimes she. looked
at wang lung, fully and without coquetry as a child does,
and he watched her and was proud of what he had done.

283



then suddenly there was his youngest son standing
before him, sprung out of the darkness of the court, and
no one had seen him enter. but he stood there in some
strange crouching way, and without taking thought of it,
wang lung was reminded in a flash of

:

'i am too old for you, my heart, and well i know it.
i am an old, old man.'

but the girl dropped her hands from her face and she
cried more passionately than he had ever heard her cry:

'young men are so cruel — i like old men best!'

when the morning came of the next day wang lung's
youngest son was gone and where he was gone no one knew.

then, as autumn flares with the false heat of ]
summer before it dies into the winter, so was it with the
quick love wang lung had for pear blossom. the brief
heat of it passed and passion died out of him; he was
fond of her, but passionless.

with the passing of the flame out of him he was suddenly
cold with age and he was an old man. nevertheless, he i
was fond of her, and it was a comfort to him that she was
in his court and she served him faithfully and with a pa-
tience beyond her year's, and he was always kind to her
with a perfect kindness, and more and more his love for i
her was the love of father for daughter.

and for his sake s

long been in his mind. now wang lung had
thought many times of what would come of his poor
fool when he was dead and there was not another one ex-
cept himself who cared whether she lived or starved, and
so he had bought a little bundle of white poisonous stuff
at the medicine shop, and he had said to himself that he
would give it to his fool to eat when he saw his own death
was near. but still he dreaded this more than the hour
of his own death, and it was a comfort to him now when
he saw that pear blossom was faithful.

so he called her to him one day and he said :

'there is none other but you to whom i can leave this
poor fool of mine when i am gone, and she will live on
and on after me, seeing that her mind has no troubles of
its own, and she has nothing to kill her and no trouble
to worry her. and well i know that when i am gone no
one will trouble to feed her or to bring her out of the rain
and the cold of winter nor to set her in the summer sun,
and she will be sent out to wander on the st

— this poor thing who has had care all her life from her
mother and from me. now here is a gate of safety for
her in this packet, and when i die, after i am dead, you

are to mix it in her rice and let her eat it, that she may
follow me where i am. and so shall i be at ease.'

but pear blossom shrank from the thing he held in his
hand and she said in her soft way:

'i can scarcely kill an insect and how could i take this
life? no, my lord, but i will take this poor fool for mine
because you have been kind to me — kinder than any in
all my life, and the only kind one.'

and wang lung could have wept for what she said,
because not one had ever requited him like this, and his
heart clung to her and he said:

'nevertheless, take it, my child, for there is none i
trust as i do you, but

even you must die one day — although
i cannot say the words — and after you there is none — no,
not one — and well i know my sons' wives -are too busy
with their children and their quarrels and my sons are men
and cannot think of such things.'

so when she saw his meaning, pear blossom took the
packet from him and said no more and wang lung trusted
her and was comforted for the fate of his poor fool.

then wang lung withdrew more and more into his
age and he lived much alone except for these two in his
courts, his poor fool and pear blossom. sometimes he
roused himself a little and he looked at pear blossom and
he was troubled and said:

'it is too quiet a life for you, my child.'

but she always answered gently and in great gratitude:

'it is quiet and safe.'

and sometimes

and again wang lung said, ' ah!'

and he would have thought of it, but the evening was
falling and his bones ached in the air left raw and chill
when the sun withdrew. for his mind now went where it
would and he could not hold it long to any one thing.
and the needs of his old body for food and for hot tea
were more keen than for anything. but at night when he
was cold, pear blossom lay warm and young against him
and he was comforted in his age with her warmth in his bed.

thus spring wore on again and again, and vaguely and
more vaguely as these years passed he felt it coming. but
still one thing remained to him and it was his love for his
land. he had gone away from it, and he had set up his
house in a town, and he was rich. but his roots were in
his land and although he forgot if for many months to-
gether, when spring came each year he must go out on to
the land; and n

thus he wandered one day in a late spring, near summer,
and he went over his fields a little way and he came to the
enclosed place upon a low hill where he had buried his

289



dead. he stood trembling on his staff and he looked at the
graves and he remembered them every one. they were
more clear to him now than the sons who lived in his own
house, more clear to him than any one except his poor fool
and except pear blossom. and his mind went back many
years and he saw it all clearly, even his little second daughter
of whom he had heard nothing for longer than he could
remember, and he saw her a pretty maid as she had been in
his house, her lips as thin and red as a shred of silk — and
she was to him like these who lay here in the land. then
he mused and he thought suddenly:
'well, and i shall be the next.'

then he went into the enclosure and he looked carefully
and he saw the place where he would lie — below

red :

c i must see to the coffin.'

this thought he held fast and painfully in his mind, and
he went back to the town and he sent for his eldest son,
and he said:

'there is something i have to say.'

'then say on,' answered the son, 'i am here.'

but when wang lung would have spoken he suddenly
could not remember what it was that he wished to say, and
the tears stood in his eyes because he had held the matter
so painfully in his mind and'now it had slipped wilfully
away from him. so he called pear blossom and he said to
her:

'child, what was it i wanted to say?'
and pear blossom answered gently:
'where were you this day?'

'i was upon the land,' wang lung replied, waiting, his
eyes fixed on her face.

and she asked gently again:
'on what piece of land?'

then suddenly the thing flew into his mind again and
he cried, laughing out of his wet eyes :

'well, and i do remember. my son, i have chosen my

290

place in the earth, and it is below my father and his brother
and above your mother and

for nothing else, because that wood is as lasting as iron,
and more lasting than human bones, and wang lung was
comforted.

and he had the coffin brought into his room and. he

looked at it every day.

then all of sudden he thought of something and he said :
'well, and i would have it moved out to the earthen

house and there i will live out my few days and there i

will die.'

and when they saw how he had set his heart they did
what he wished, and he went back to the house on his
land, he and pear blossom and the fool, and what servants
they needed; and wang lung took up his abode again on
his land, and he left the house in the town to the family
he had founded.

spring passed and summer passed into harvest and in
the hot autumn sun before winter comes wang lung sat
where his father had sat against the wall. and he thought
no more about anything now except his food and his drink
and his land. but of his land he thought no more what-
harvest it would bring or what seed would be planted or of
anyt

he was content, holding it thus, and i
he thought of it fitfully and of his good coffin that was there :
and the kind earth waited without haste until he came to it.

his sons were proper enough to him and they came
to him every day or at most once in two days, and they
sent him delicate food fit for his age, but he liked best to



291



have one stir up meal in hot water and sup it as his father
had done.

sometimes he complained a little of his sons if they
came not every day and he said to pear blossom, who was
always near him:

'well, and what are they so busy about?'

but if pear blossom said : 'they are in the prime of life
and now they have many affairs; your eldest son has been
made an officer in the town among the rich men, and he
has a new wife, and your second son is setting up a great
grain market for himself,' wang lung listened to her, but
he could not comprehend all this and he forgot it as soon
as he looked out over his land.

but one day he saw clearly for a little while. it was
