ge the pond ran up into fringing
groves of fir and maple and lay all darkly translucent in their wavering
shadows. here and there a wild plum leaned out from the bank like a
white-clad girl tip-toeing to her own reflection. from the marsh at the
head of the pond came the clear, mournfully-sweet chorus of the frogs.
there was a little gray house peering around a white apple orchard on
a slope beyond and, although it was not yet quite dark, a light was
shining from one of its windows.

â€œthatâ€™s barryâ€™s pond,â€ said matthew.

â€œoh, i donâ€™t like that name, either. i shall call it--let me see--the
lake of shining waters. yes, that is the right name for it. i know
because of the thrill. when i hit on a name that suits exactly it gives
me a thrill. do things ever give you a thrill?â€

matthew ruminated.

â€œwell now, yes. it always kind of gives me a thrill to see them ugly
white grubs that spade up in the cucumber beds. i hate the look of
them.â€

â€œoh, i donâ€™t think that can be exac

tly the same kind of a thrill. do you
think it can? there doesnâ€™t seem to be much connection between grubs
and lakes of shining waters, does there? but why do other people call it
barryâ€™s pond?â€

â€œi reckon because mr. barry lives up there in that house. orchard
slopeâ€™s the name of his place. if it wasnâ€™t for that big bush behind it
you could see green gables from here. but we have to go over the bridge
and round by the road, so itâ€™s near half a mile further.â€

â€œhas mr. barry any little girls? well, not so very little either--about
my size.â€

â€œheâ€™s got one about eleven. her name is diana.â€

â€œoh!â€ with a long indrawing of breath. â€œwhat a perfectly lovely name!â€

â€œwell now, i dunno. thereâ€™s something dreadful heathenish about it,
seems to me. iâ€™d ruther jane or mary or some sensible name like that.
but when diana was born there was a schoolmaster boarding there and they
gave him the naming of her and he called her diana.â€

over to comfort myself whenever iâ€™m disappointed in anything.â€

â€œi donâ€™t see where the comforting comes in myself,â€ said marilla.

â€œwhy, because it sounds so nice and romantic, just as if i were a
heroine in a book, you know. i am so fond of romantic things, and a
graveyard full of buried hopes is about as romantic a thing as one can
imagine isnâ€™t it? iâ€™m rather glad i have one. are we going across the
lake of shining waters today?â€

â€œweâ€™re not going over barryâ€™s pond, if thatâ€™s what you mean by your lake
of shining waters. weâ€™re going by the shore road.â€

â€œshore road sounds nice,â€ said anne dreamily. â€œis it as nice as it
sounds? just when you said â€˜shore roadâ€™ i saw it in a picture in my
mind, as quick as that! and white sands is a pretty name, too; but i
donâ€™t like it as well as avonlea. avonlea is a lovely name. it just
sounds like music. how far is it to white sands?â€

â€œitâ€™s five miles; and as youâ€™re evidently bent on t

igently for some moments
longer.

â€œmarilla,â€ she demanded presently, â€œdo you think that i shall ever have
a bosom friend in avonlea?â€

â€œa--a what kind of friend?â€

â€œa bosom friend--an intimate friend, you know--a really kindred spirit
to whom i can confide my inmost soul. iâ€™ve dreamed of meeting her all
my life. i never really supposed i would, but so many of my loveliest
dreams have come true all at once that perhaps this one will, too. do
you think itâ€™s possible?â€

â€œdiana barry lives over at orchard slope and sheâ€™s about your age. sheâ€™s
a very nice little girl, and perhaps she will be a playmate for you when
she comes home. sheâ€™s visiting her aunt over at carmody just now. youâ€™ll
have to be careful how you behave yourself, though. mrs. barry is a
very particular woman. she wonâ€™t let diana play with any little girl who
isnâ€™t nice and good.â€

anne looked at marilla through the apple blossoms, her eyes aglow with
interest.

â€œwhat is diana like? her hair i

and oh, her good-bye came back to me in such sad, sad tones. i had
become so attached to her that i hadnâ€™t the heart to imagine a bosom
friend at the asylum, even if there had been any scope for imagination
there.â€

â€œi think itâ€™s just as well there wasnâ€™t,â€ said marilla drily. â€œi
donâ€™t approve of such goings-on. you seem to half believe your own
imaginations. it will be well for you to have a real live friend to
put such nonsense out of your head. but donâ€™t let mrs. barry hear you
talking about your katie maurices and your violettas or sheâ€™ll think you
tell stories.â€

â€œoh, i wonâ€™t. i couldnâ€™t talk of them to everybody--their memories are
too sacred for that. but i thought iâ€™d like to have you know about them.
oh, look, hereâ€™s a big bee just tumbled out of an apple blossom. just

be terrible; i donâ€™t think i could endure it; most likely i would go
into consumption; iâ€™m so thin as it is, you see. but that would be
better than being a trial to you.â€

â€œnonsense,â€ said marilla, vexed at herself for having made the child
cry. â€œi donâ€™t want to send you back to the asylum, iâ€™m sure. all i want
is that you should behave like other little girls and not make yourself
ridiculous. donâ€™t cry any more. iâ€™ve got some news for you. diana barry
came home this afternoon. iâ€™m going up to see if i can borrow a skirt
pattern from mrs. barry, and if you like you can come with me and get
acquainted with diana.â€

anne rose to her feet, with clasped hands, the tears still glistening on
her cheeks; the dish towel she had been hemming slipped unheeded to the
floor.

â€œoh, marilla, iâ€™m frightened--now that it has come iâ€™m actually
frightened. what if she shouldnâ€™t like me! it would be the most tragical
disappointment of my life.â€

â

 you must be polite and
well behaved, and donâ€™t make any of your startling speeches. for pityâ€™s
sake, if the child isnâ€™t actually trembling!â€

anne _was_ trembling. her face was pale and tense.

â€œoh, marilla, youâ€™d be excited, too, if you were going to meet a little
girl you hoped to be your bosom friend and whose mother mightnâ€™t like
you,â€ she said as she hastened to get her hat.

they went over to orchard slope by the short cut across the brook and up
the firry hill grove. mrs. barry came to the kitchen door in answer to
marillaâ€™s knock. she was a tall black-eyed, black-haired woman, with a
very resolute mouth. she had the reputation of being very strict with
her children.

â€œhow do you do, marilla?â€ she said cordially. â€œcome in. and this is the
little girl you have adopted, i suppose?â€

â€œyes, this is anne shirley,â€ said marilla.

â€œspelled with an e,â€ gasped anne, who, tremulous and excited as she was,
was determined there should be no misunderstanding on t

mrs. barry, not hearing or not comprehending, merely shook hands and
said kindly:

â€œhow are you?â€

â€œi am well in body although considerable rumpled up in spirit, thank you
maâ€™am,â€ said anne gravely. then aside to marilla in an audible whisper,
â€œthere wasnâ€™t anything startling in that, was there, marilla?â€

diana was sitting on the sofa, reading a book which she dropped when the
callers entered. she was a very pretty little girl, with her motherâ€™s
black eyes and hair, and rosy cheeks, and

 the merry expression which was
her inheritance from her father.

â€œthis is my little girl diana,â€ said mrs. barry. â€œdiana, you might take
anne out into the garden and show her your flowers. it will be better
for you than straining your eyes over that book. she reads entirely
too much--â€ this to marilla as the little girls went out--â€œand i canâ€™t
prevent her, for her father aids and abets her. sheâ€™s always poring over
a book. iâ€™m glad she has the prospect of a playmate--perhaps it will
take her more out-of-doors.â€

outside in the garden, which was full of mellow sunset light streaming
through t

he dark old firs to the west of it, stood anne and diana,
gazing bashfully at each other over a clump of gorgeous tiger lilies.

the barry garden was a bowery wilderness of flowers which would have
delighted anneâ€™s heart at any time less fraught with destiny. it was
encircled by huge old willows and tall firs, beneath which flourished
flowers that loved the shade. prim, right-angled paths neatly bordered
with clamshells, intersected it like moist red ribbons and in the beds
between old-fashioned flowers ran riot. there were rosy bleeding-hearts
and great splendid crimson peonies; white, fragrant narcissi and thorny,
sweet scotch

kinds, you know.â€

â€œi never heard of but one kind,â€ said diana doubtfully.

â€œthere really is another. oh, it isnâ€™t wicked at all. it just means
vowing and promising solemnly.â€

â€œwell, i donâ€™t mind doing that,â€ agreed diana, relieved. â€œhow do you do
it?â€

â€œwe must join hands--so,â€ said anne gravely. â€œit ought to be over
running water. weâ€™ll just imagine this path is running water. iâ€™ll
repeat the oath first. i solemnly swear to be faithful to my bosom
friend, diana barry, as long as the sun and moon shall endure. now you
say it and put my name in.â€

diana repeated the â€œoathâ€ with a laugh fore and aft. then she said:

â€œyouâ€™re a queer girl, anne. i heard before that you were queer. but i
believe iâ€™m going to like you real well.â€

when marilla and anne went home diana went with them as far as the log
bridge. the two little girls walked with their arms about each other.
at the brook they parted with many promises to spend the next afternoon
together.

iâ€™d rather be anne of green gables sewing patchwork than anne of any
other place with nothing to do but play. i wish time went as quick
sewing patches as it does when iâ€™m playing with diana, though. oh, we
do have such elegant times, marilla. i have to furnish most of the
imagination, but iâ€™m well able to do that. diana is simply perfect in
every other way. you know that little piece of land across the brook
that runs up between our farm and mr. barryâ€™s. it belongs to mr. william
bell, and right in the corner there is a little ring of white birch
trees--the most romantic spot, marilla. diana and i have our playhouse
there. we call it idlewild. isnâ€™t that a poetical name? i assure you it
took me some time to think it out. i stayed awake nearly a whole night
before i invented it. then, just as i was dropping off to sleep, it came
like an inspiration. diana was _enraptured_ when she heard it. we have got
our house fixed up elegantly. you mu

we have the fairy glass there, too. the fairy glass
is as lovely as a dream. diana found it out in the woods behind their
chicken house. itâ€™s all full of rainbows--just little young rainbows
that havenâ€™t grown big yet--and dianaâ€™s mother told her it was broken
off a hanging lamp they once had. but itâ€™s nice to imagine the fairies
lost it one night when they had a ball, so we call it the fairy glass.
matthew is going to make us a table. oh, we have named that little round
pool over in mr. barryâ€™s field willowmere. i got that name out of the
book diana lent me. that was a thrilling book, marilla. the heroine
had five lovers. iâ€™d be satisfied with one, wouldnâ€™t you? she was very
handsome and she went through great tribulations. she could faint as
easy as anything. iâ€™d love to be able to faint, wouldnâ€™t you, marilla?
itâ€™s so romantic. but iâ€™m really very healthy for all iâ€™m so thin. i

people calling you crazy.â€

anne, starting out alone in the morning, went down loverâ€™s lane as far
as the brook. here diana met her, and the two little girls went on
up the lane under the leafy arch of maples--â€œmaples are such sociable
trees,â€ said anne; â€œtheyâ€™re always rustling and whispering to
youâ€--until they came to a rustic bridge. then they left the lane
and walked through mr. barryâ€™s back field and past willowmere. beyond
willowmere came violet vale--a little green dimple in the shadow of mr.
andrew bellâ€™s big woods. â€œof course there are no violets there now,â€
 anne told marilla, â€œbut diana says there are millions of them in spring.
oh, marilla, canâ€™t you just imagine you see them? it actually takes away
my breath. i named it violet vale. diana says she never saw the beat
of me for hitting on fancy names for places. itâ€™s nice to be clever at
something, isnâ€

mes she was wont to run into the kitchen without
knocking; but now she knocked primly at the front door. and when anne,
dressed in her second best, as primly opened it, both little girls
shook hands as gravely as if they had never met before. this unnatural
solemnity lasted until after diana had been taken to the east gable to
lay off her hat and then had sat for ten minutes in the sitting room,
toes in position.

â€œhow is your mother?â€ inquired anne politely, just as if she had not
seen mrs. barry picking apples that morning in excellent health and
spirits.

â€œshe is very well, thank you. i suppose mr. cuthbert is hauling potatoes
to the _lily sands_ this afternoon, is he?â€ said diana, who had ridden
down to mr. harmon andrewsâ€™s that morning in matthewâ€™s cart.

â€œyes. our potato crop is very good this year. i hope your fatherâ€™s crop
is good too.â€

â€œit is fairly good, thank you. have you picked many of your apples yet?â€

â€œoh, ever so many,â€ said anne forgetting to be d

anne pleaded.

â€œi never heard of company going home without tea,â€ she mourned. â€œoh,
diana, do you suppose that itâ€™s possible youâ€™re really taking the
smallpox? if you are iâ€™ll go and nurse you, you can depend on that. iâ€™ll
never forsake you. but i do wish youâ€™d stay till after tea. where do you
feel bad?â€

â€œiâ€™m awful dizzy,â€ said diana.

and indeed, she walked very dizzily. anne, with tears of disappointment
in her eyes, got dianaâ€™s hat and went with her as far as the barry
yard fence. then she wept all the way back to green gables, where she
sorrowfully put the remainder of the raspberry cordial back into the
pantry and got tea ready for matthew and jerry, with all the zest gone
out of the performance.

the next day was sunday and as the rain poured down in torrents from
dawn till dusk anne did not stir abroad from green gables. monday
afternoon marilla sent her down to mrs. lyndeâ€™s on an errand. in a very
short space of time anne came flying back up the lane w

. into the kitchen she dashed and flung herself face
downward on the sofa in an agony.

â€œwhatever has gone wrong now, anne?â€ queried marilla in doubt and
dismay. â€œi do hope you havenâ€™t gone and been saucy to mrs. lynde again.â€

no answer from anne save more tears and stormier sobs!

â€œanne shirley, when i ask you a question i want to be answered. sit
right up this very minute and tell me what you are crying about.â€

anne sat up, tragedy personified.

â€œmrs. lynde was up to see mrs. barry today and mrs. barry was in an
awful state,â€ she wailed. â€œshe says that i set diana _drunk_ saturday
and sent her home in a disgraceful condition. and she says i must be a
thoroughly bad, wicked little girl and sheâ€™s never, never going to let
diana play with me again. oh, marilla, iâ€™m just overcome with woe.â€

marilla stared in blank amazement.

â€œset diana drunk!â€ she said when she found her voice. â€œanne are you or
mrs. barry crazy? what on earth did you give her?â€

â€œnot a t

hought
raspberry cordial would set people drunk, marilla--not even if they
drank three big tumblerfuls as diana did. oh, it sounds so--so--like
mrs. thomasâ€™s husband! but i didnâ€™t mean to set her drunk.â€

â€œdrunk fiddlesticks!â€ said marilla, marching to the sitting room pantry.
there on the shelf was a bottle which she at once recognized as one
containing some of her three-year-old homemade currant wine for which
she was celebrated in avonlea, although certain of the stricter sort,
mrs. barry among them, disapproved strongly of it. and at the same time
marilla recollected that she had put the bottle of raspberry cordial
down in the cellar instead of in the pantry as she had told anne.

she went back to the kitchen with the wine bottle in her hand. her face
was twitching in spite of herself.

â€œanne, you certainly have a genius for getting into trouble. you went
and gave diana currant wine instead of raspberry cordial. didnâ€™t you
know the difference yourself?â€

â€œi never tasted

 it,â€ said anne. â€œi thought it was the cordial. i meant
to be so--so--hospitable. diana got awfully sick and had to go home.
mrs. barry told mrs. lynde she was simply dead drunk. she just laughed
silly-like when her mother asked her what was the matter and went to
sleep and slept for hours. her mother smelled her breath and knew she
was drunk. she had a fearful headache all day yesterday. mrs. barry is
so indignant. she will never believe but what i did it on purpose.â€

â€œi should think she would better punish diana for being so greedy as to
drink three glassfuls of anything,â€ said marilla shortly. â€œwhy, three
of those big glasses would have made her sick even if it had only been
cordial. well, this story will be a nice handle for those folks who are
so down on me for making currant wine, although i havenâ€™t made any for
three years ever since i found out that the minister didnâ€™t

 approve. i
just kept that bottle for sickness. there, there, child, donâ€™t cry. i
canâ€™t see as you were to blame although iâ€™m sorry it happened so.â€

â€œi must cry,â€ said anne. â€œmy heart is broken. the stars in their courses
fight against me, marilla. diana and i are parted forever. oh, marilla,
i little dreamed of this when first we swore our vows of friendship.â€

â€œdonâ€™t be foolish, anne. mrs. barry will think better of it when she
finds youâ€™re not to blame. i suppose she thinks youâ€™ve done it for a
silly joke or something of that sort. youâ€™d best go up this evening and
tell her how it was.â€

â€œmy courage fails me at the thought of facing dianaâ€™s injured mother,â€
 sighed anne. â€œi wish youâ€™d go, marilla. youâ€™re so much more dignified
than i am. likely sheâ€™d listen to you quicker than to me.â€

â€œwell, i will,â€ said marilla, reflecting that it would probably be the
w

iser course. â€œdonâ€™t cry any more, anne. it will be all right.â€

marilla had changed her mind about it being all right by the time she
got back from orchard slope. anne was watching for her coming and flew
to the porch door to meet her.

â€œoh, marilla, i know by your face that itâ€™s been no use,â€ she said
sorrowfully. â€œmrs. barry wonâ€™t forgive me?â€

â€œmrs. barry indeed!â€ snapped marilla. â€œof all the unreasonable women
i ever saw sheâ€™s the worst. i told her it was all a mistake and you
werenâ€™t to blame, but she just simply didnâ€™t believe me. and she rubbed
it well in about my currant wine and how iâ€™d always said it couldnâ€™t
have the least effect on anybody. i just told her plainly that currant
wine wasnâ€™t meant to be drunk three tumblerfuls at a time and that if a
child i had to do with was so greedy iâ€™d sober her up with a right good

spanking.â€

marilla whisked into the kitchen, grievously disturbed, leaving a very
much distracted little soul in the porch behind her. presently anne
stepped out bareheaded into the chill autumn dusk; very determinedly and
steadily she took her way down through the sere clover field over the
log bridge and up through the spruce grove, lighted by a pale little
moon hanging low over the western woods. mrs. barry, coming to the door
in answer to a timid knock, found a white-lipped eager-eyed suppliant on
the doorstep.

her face hardened. mrs. barry was a woman of strong prejudices and
dislikes, and her anger was of the cold, sullen sort which is always
hardest to overcome. to do her justice, she really believed anne had
made diana drunk out of sheer malice prepense, and she was honestly
anxious to preserve her little daughter from the contamination of
further intimacy with such a child.

â€œwhat do you 
 
 ___________________________
 
want?â€ she said stiffly.

anne clasped her hands.

â€œoh, mrs. barry, please forgive me. i did not mean to--to--intoxicate
diana. how could i? just imagine if you were a poor little orphan girl
that kind people had adopted and you had just one bosom friend in all
the world. do you think you would intoxicate her on purpose? i thought
it was only raspberry cordial. i was firmly convinced it was raspberry
cordial. oh, please donâ€™t say that you wonâ€™t let diana play with me any
more. if you do you will cover my life with a dark cloud of woe.â€

this speech which
 
 ___________________________
 
 would have softened good mrs. lyndeâ€™s heart in a
twinkling, had no effect on mrs. barry except to irritate her still
more. she was suspicious of anneâ€™s big words and dramatic gestures and
imagined that the child was making fun of her. so she said, coldly and
cruelly:

â€œi donâ€™t think you are a fit little girl for diana to associate with.
youâ€™d better go home and behave yourself.â€

anneâ€™s lips quivered.

â€œwonâ€™t you let me see diana just once to say farewell?â€ she implored.

â€œdiana has gone over to carmody with her father,â€ said mrs. barry, going
in and shutting
 
 ___________________________
 
 the door.

anne went back to green gables calm with despair.

â€œmy last hope is gone,â€ she told marilla. â€œi went up and saw mrs. barry
myself and she treated me very insultingly. marilla, i do _not_ think she
is a well-bred woman. there is nothing more to do except to pray and i
havenâ€™t much hope that thatâ€™ll do much good because, marilla, i do not
believe that god himself can do very much with such an obstinate person
as mrs. barry.â€

â€œanne, you shouldnâ€™t say such thingsâ€ rebuked marilla, striving to
overcome that unholy tendency to laughter which she was dismayed to find
growing upon her. and indeed, when she told the whole story to matthew
that night, she did laugh heartily over anneâ€™s tribulations.

but when she slipped into the east gable before going to bed and found
that anne had cried herself to sleep an unaccustomed softness crept into
her face.

â€œpoor little soul,â€ she murmured, lifting a loose curl
 
 ___________________________
 
 an affecting farewell down by the spring. it will
be sacred in my memory forever. i used the most pathetic language i
could think of and said â€˜thouâ€™ and â€˜thee.â€™ â€˜thouâ€™ and â€˜theeâ€™ seem so
much more romantic than â€˜you.â€™ diana gave me a lock of her hair and iâ€™m
going to sew it up in a little bag and wear it around my neck all my
life. please see that it is buried with me, for i donâ€™t believe iâ€™ll
live very long. perhaps when she sees me lying cold and dead before her
mrs. barry may feel remorse for what she has done and will let diana
come to my funeral.â€

â€œi donâ€™t think there is much fear of your dying of grief as long as you
can talk, anne,â€ said marilla unsympathetically.

the following monday anne surprised marilla by coming down from her room
with her basket of books on her arm and hip and her lips primmed up into
a line of determination.

â€œiâ€™m going back to school,â€ she announced. â€œthat is all there is left
in life for me, now that my friend has

r dinner hour, met
with a more favorable reception. anne was graciously pleased to accept
it and rewarded the donor with a smile which exalted that infatuated
youth straightway into the seventh heaven of delight and caused him to
make such fearful errors in his dictation that mr. phillips kept him in
after school to rewrite it.

but as,

  the caesarâ€™s pageant shorn of brutusâ€™ bust
  did but of romeâ€™s best son remind her more,

so the marked absence of any tribute or recognition from diana barry who
was sitting with gertie pye embittered anneâ€™s little triumph.

â€œdiana might just have smiled at me once, i think,â€ she mourned to
marilla that night. but the next morning a note most fearfully and
wonderfully twisted and folded, and a small parcel were passed across to
anne.

dear anne (ran the former)


mother says iâ€™m not to play with you or talk to you even in school. it
isnâ€™t my fault and donâ€™t be cross at me, because i love you as much

diana barry.


anne read the note, kissed the bookmark, and dispatched a prompt reply
back to the other side of the school.


my own darling diana:--

of course i am not cross at you because you have to obey your mother.
our spirits can commune. i shall keep your lovely present forever.

imagination--but after having been dianaâ€™s busum friend i cannot be

 here and there the
dark pointed firs stood up with snow powdering their branches and the
wind whistling through them. anne thought it was truly delightful to go
skimming through all this mystery and loveliness with your bosom friend
who had been so long estranged.

minnie may, aged three, was really very sick. she lay on the kitchen
sofa feverish and restless, while her hoarse breathing could be heard
all over the house. young mary joe, a buxom, broad-faced french girl
from the creek, whom mrs. barry had engaged to stay with the children
during her absence, was helpless and bewildered, quite incapable of
thinking what to do, or doing it if she thought of it.

anne went to work with skill and promptness.

â€œminnie may has croup all right; sheâ€™s pretty bad, but iâ€™ve seen them
worse. first we must have lots of hot water. i declare, diana, there
isnâ€™t more than a cupful in the kettle! there, iâ€™ve filled it up, and,
mary joe, you may put some wood in the stove. i donâ€™t want to hurt yo

s--â€˜this is the last
lingering hope and i fear, tis a vain one.â€™ but in about three minutes
she coughed up the phlegm and began to get better right away. you must
just imagine my relief, doctor, because i canâ€™t express it in words. you
know there are some things that cannot be expressed in words.â€

â€œyes, i know,â€ nodded the doctor. he looked at anne as if he were
thinking some things about her that couldnâ€™t be expressed in words.
later on, however, he expressed them to mr. and mrs. barry.

â€œthat little redheaded girl they have over at cuthbertâ€™s is as smart as
they make â€˜em. i tell you she saved that babyâ€™s life, for it would have
been too late by the time i got there. she seems to have a skill and
presence of mind perfectly wonderful in a child of her age. i never saw
anything like the eyes of her when she was explaining the case to me.â€

marilla had something to tell anne, but she did not tell it just then
for she knew if she did anneâ€™s consequent excitement would lift her
clear out of the region of such material matters as appetite or dinner.
not until anne had finished her saucer of blue plums did marilla say:

â€œmrs. barry was here this afternoon, anne. she wanted to see you, but i
wouldnâ€™t wake you up. she says you saved minnie mayâ€™s life, and she is
very sorry she acted as she did in that affair of the currant wine. she
says she knows now you didnâ€™t mean to set diana drunk, and she hopes
youâ€™ll forgive her and be good friends with diana again. youâ€™re to go
over this evening if you like for diana canâ€™t stir outside the door

rose over gleaming white spaces and dark glens of spruce. the tinkles
of sleigh bells among the snowy hills came like elfin chimes through
the frosty air, but their music was not sweeter than the song in anneâ€™s
heart and on her lips.

â€œyou see before you a perfectly happy person, marilla,â€ she announced.
â€œiâ€™m perfectly happy--yes, in spite of my red hair. just at present i
have a soul above red hair. mrs. barry kissed me and cried and said she
was so sorry and she could never repay me. i felt fearfully embarrassed,
marilla, but i just said as politely as i could, â€˜i have no hard
feelings for you, mrs. barry. i assure you once for all that i did not
mean to intoxicate diana and henceforth i shall cover the past with the
mantle of oblivion.â€™ that was a pretty dignified way of speaking wasnâ€™t
it, marilla?â€

us, and we pledged a solemn vow never to reveal it to anyone else. diana
gave me a beautiful card with a wreath of roses on it and a verse of
poetry:â€

      â€œif you love me as i love you
      nothing but death can part us two.â€

â€œand that is true, marilla. weâ€™re going to ask mr. phillips to let us
sit together in school again, and gertie pye can go with minnie andrews.
we had an elegant tea. mrs. barry had the very best china set out,
marilla, just as if i was real company. i canâ€™t tell you what a thrill
it gave me. nobody ever used their very best china on my account before.
and we had fruit cake and pound cake and doughnuts and two kinds of
preserves, marilla. and mrs. barry asked me if i took tea and said â€˜pa,
why donâ€™t you pass the biscuits to anne?â€™ it must be lovely to be grown
up, marilla, when just being treated as if you were is so nice.â€

oneâ€™s feelings. after tea diana and i made taffy. the taffy wasnâ€™t very
good, i suppose because neither diana nor i had ever made any before.
diana left me to stir it while she buttered the plates and i forgot and
let it burn; and then when we set it out on the platform to cool the cat
walked over one plate and that had to be thrown away. but the making of
it was splendid fun. then when i came home mrs. barry asked me to come
over as often as i could and diana stood at the window and threw kisses
to me all the way down to loverâ€™s lane. i assure you, marilla, that i
feel like praying tonight and iâ€™m going to think out a special brand-new
prayer in honor of the occasion.â€

running breathlessly down from the east gable one february evening.

so excited.â€

â€œyou can calm down then, because youâ€™re not going. youâ€™re better at home
in your own bed, and as for that club concert, itâ€™s all nonsense, and
little girls should not be allowed to go out to such places at all.â€

â€œiâ€™m sure the debating club is a most respectable affair,â€ pleaded anne.

â€œiâ€™m not saying it isnâ€™t. but youâ€™re not going to begin gadding about
to concerts and staying out all hours of the night. pretty doings for
children. iâ€™m surprised at mrs. barryâ€™s letting diana go.â€

â€œbut itâ€™s such a very special occasion,â€ mourned anne, on the verge of
tears. â€œdiana has only one birthday in a year. it isnâ€™t as if birthdays
were common things, marilla. prissy andrews is going to recite â€˜curfew
must not ring tonight.â€™ that is such a good moral piece, marilla, iâ€™m
sure it would do me lots of good to hear it. and the choir are going to
sing four lovely pathetic songs that are pretty near as good as hymns.
and oh, marilla, the minister

heâ€™s going to give an address. that will be just about the same thing as
a sermon. please, maynâ€™t i go, marilla?â€

â€œyou heard what i said, anne, didnâ€™t you? take off your boots now and go
to bed. itâ€™s past eight.â€

â€œthereâ€™s just one more thing, marilla,â€ said anne, with the air of
producing the last shot in her locker. â€œmrs. barry told diana that we
might sleep in the spare-room bed. think of the honor of your little
anne being put in the spare-room bed.â€

â€œitâ€™s an honor youâ€™ll have to get along without. go to bed, anne, and
donâ€™t let me hear another word out of you.â€

when anne, with tears rolling over her cheeks, had gone sorrowfully
upstairs, matthew, who had been apparently sound asleep on the lounge
during the whole dialogue, opened his eyes and said decidedly:

â€œwell now, marilla, i think you ought to

ul--itâ€™s really dreadful--but did you ever
know anything so funny, anne?â€

â€œwho is your aunt josephine?â€

â€œsheâ€™s fatherâ€™s aunt and she lives in charlottetown. sheâ€™s awfully
old--seventy anyhow--and i donâ€™t believe she was _ever_ a little girl. we
were expecting her out for a visit, but not so soon. sheâ€™s awfully prim
and proper and sheâ€™ll scold dreadfully about this, i know. well, weâ€™ll
have to sleep with minnie may--and you canâ€™t think how she kicks.â€

miss josephine barry did not appear at the early breakfast the next
morning. mrs. barry smiled kindly at the two little girls.

â€œdid you have a good time last night? i tried to stay awake until you
came home, for i wanted to tell you aunt josephine had come and that you
would have to go upstairs after all, but i was so tired i fell asleep. i
hope you didnâ€™t disturb your aunt, diana.â€

presently resulted in the barry household until the late afternoon, when
she went down to mrs. lyndeâ€™s on an errand for marilla.

â€œso you and diana nearly frightened poor old miss barry to death last
night?â€ said mrs. lynde severely, but with a twinkle in her eye. â€œmrs.
barry was here a few minutes ago on her way to carmody. sheâ€™s feeling
real worried over it. old miss barry was in a terrible temper when she
got up this morning--and josephine barryâ€™s temper is no joke, i can tell
you that. she wouldnâ€™t speak to diana at all.â€

â€œit wasnâ€™t dianaâ€™s fault,â€ said anne contritely. â€œit was mine. i
suggested racing to see who would get into bed first.â€

â€œi knew it!â€ said mrs. lynde, with the exultation of a correct guesser.

trouble, thatâ€™s what. old miss barry came out to sta

for diana, but now she is determined to do nothing at all for such a
tomboy. oh, i guess they had a lively time of it there this morning. the
barrys must feel cut up. old miss barry is rich and theyâ€™d like to keep
on the good side of her. of course, mrs. barry didnâ€™t say just that to
me, but iâ€™m a pretty good judge of human nature, thatâ€™s what.â€

â€œiâ€™m such an unlucky girl,â€ mourned anne. â€œiâ€™m always getting into
scrapes myself and getting my best friends--people iâ€™d shed my heartâ€™s
blood for--into them too. can you tell me why it is so, mrs. lynde?â€

was my fault and iâ€™ve got to confess. iâ€™ve had practice in confessing,
fortunately.â€

â€œwell, sheâ€™s in the room,â€ said diana. â€œyou can go in if you want to. i
wouldnâ€™t dare. and i donâ€™t believe youâ€™ll do a bit of good.â€

with this encouragement anne bearded the lion in its den--that is to
say, walked resolutely up to the sitting-room door and knocked faintly.
a sharp â€œcome inâ€ followed.

miss josephine barry, thin, prim, and rigid, was knitting fiercely by
the fire, her wrath quite unappeased and her eyes snapping through her
gold-rimmed glasses. she wheeled around in her chair, expecting to see
diana, and beheld a white-faced girl whose great eyes were brimmed up
with a mixture of desperate courage and shrinking terror.

â€œwho are you?â€ demanded miss josephine barry, without ceremony.

â€œconfess what?â€

â€œthat it was all my fault about jumping into bed on you last night. i

diana is a very ladylike girl, miss barry. so you must see how unjust it
is to blame her.â€

â€œoh, i must, hey? i rather think diana did her share of the jumping at
least. such carryings on in a respectable house!â€

â€œbut we were only in fun,â€ persisted anne. â€œi think you ought to forgive
us, miss barry, now that weâ€™ve apologized. and anyhow, please forgive
diana and let her have her music lessons. dianaâ€™s heart is set on her
music lessons, miss barry, and i know too well what it is to set your
heart on a thing and not get

. but she still said
severely:

â€œi donâ€™t think it is any excuse for you that you were only in fun.
little girls never indulged in that kind of fun when i was young. you
donâ€™t know what it is to be awakened out of a sound sleep, after a long
and arduous journey, by two great girls coming bounce down on you.â€

â€œi donâ€™t _know_, but i can _imagine_,â€ said anne eagerly. â€œiâ€™m sure it must
have been very disturbing. but then, there is our side of it too. have
you any imagination, miss barry? if you have, just put yourself in
our place. we didnâ€™t know there was anybody in that bed and you nearly
scared us to death. it was simply awful the way we felt. and then we
couldnâ€™t sleep in the spare room after being promised. i suppose you are
used to sleeping in spare rooms. but just imagine what you would feel
like if you were a little orphan girl who had never had such an honor.â€

all the snap had gone by this time. miss barry actually laughed--a
sound which caused diana, waiting i

go home to miss marilla cuthbert. miss marilla cuthbert is a very kind
lady who has taken me to bring up properly. she is doing her best, but
it is very discouraging work. you must not blame her because i jumped on
the bed. but before i go i do wish you would tell me if you will forgive
diana and stay just as long as you meant to in avonlea.â€

â€œi think perhaps i will if you will come over and talk to me
occasionally,â€ said miss barry.

that evening miss barry gave diana a silver bangle bracelet and told the
senior members of the household that she had unpacked her valise.

â€œiâ€™ve made up my mind to stay simply for the sake of getting better
acquainted with that anne-girl,â€ she said frankly. â€œshe amuses me, and
at my time of life an amusing person is a rarity.â€

marillaâ€™s only comment when she heard the story was, â€œi told you so.â€
 this was for matthewâ€™s benefit.

when miss barry went away she said:

iâ€™ll put you in my very sparest spare-room bed to sleep.â€

â€œmiss barry was a kindred spirit, after all,â€ anne confided to marilla.
â€œyou wouldnâ€™t think so to look at her, but she is. you donâ€™t find it
right out at first, as in matthewâ€™s case, but after a while you come
to see it. kindred spirits are not so scarce as i used to think. itâ€™s
splendid to find out there are so many of them in the world.â€

are you sorry you kept me, marilla?â€

â€œno, i canâ€™t say iâ€™m sorry,â€ said marilla, who sometimes wondered how
she could have lived before anne came to green gables, â€œno, not exactly
sorry. if youâ€™ve finished your lessons, anne, i want you to run over and
ask mrs. barry if sheâ€™ll lend me dianaâ€™s apron pattern.â€

â€œoh--itâ€™s--itâ€™s too dark,â€ cried anne.

â€œtoo dark? why, itâ€™s only twilight. and goodness knows youâ€™ve gone over
often enough after dark.â€

â€œiâ€™ll go over early in the morning,â€ said anne eagerly. â€œiâ€™ll get up at
sunrise and go over, marilla.â€

â€œwhat has got into your head now, anne shirley? i want that pattern to

true. and ruby gillis says--â€

â€œanne shirley,â€ interrupted marilla firmly, â€œi never want to hear you
talking in this fashion again. iâ€™ve had my doubts about that imagination
of yours right along, and if this is going to be the outcome of it, i
wonâ€™t countenance any such doings. youâ€™ll go right over to barryâ€™s, and
youâ€™ll go through that spruce grove, just for a lesson and a warning to
you. and never let me hear a word out of your head about haunted woods
again.â€

anne might plead and cry as she liked--and did, for her terror was very
real. her imagination had run away with her and she held the spruce
grove in mortal dread after nightfall. but marilla was inexorable. she
marched the shrinking ghost-seer down to the spring and ordered her

the brown floor of the grove made her heart stand still. the long-drawn
wail of two old boughs rubbing against each other brought out the
perspiration in beads on her forehead. the swoop of bats in the darkness
over her was as the wings of unearthly creatures. when she reached mr.
william bellâ€™s field she fled across it as if pursued by an army of
white things, and arrived at the barry kitchen door so out of breath
that she could hardly gasp out her request for the apron pattern.
diana was away so that she had no excuse to linger. the dreadful
return journey had to be faced. anne went back over it with shut eyes,
preferring to take the risk of dashing her brains out among the boughs
to that of seeing a white thing. when she finally stumbled over the log
bridge she drew one long shivering breath of relief.

with layers of ruby jelly and, in imagination, saw mrs. allan eating it
and possibly asking for another piece!

â€œyouâ€™ll be using the best tea set, of course, marilla,â€ she said. â€œcan i
fix the table with ferns and wild roses?â€

â€œi think thatâ€™s all nonsense,â€ sniffed marilla. â€œin my opinion itâ€™s the
eatables that matter and not flummery decorations.â€

â€œmrs. barry had _her_ table decorated,â€ said anne, who was not entirely
guiltless of the wisdom of the serpent, â€œand the minister paid her an
elegant compliment. he said it was a feast for the eye as well as the
palate.â€

â€œwell, do as you like,â€ said marilla, who was quite determined not to
be surpassed by mrs. barry or anybody else. â€œonly mind you leave enough
room for the dishes and the food.â€

anne laid herself out to decorate in a manner and after a fashion that
should leave mrs. barryâ€™

live through more than two weeks, as it happened. almost a
month having elapsed since the liniment cake episode, it was high time
for her to get into fresh trouble of some sort, little mistakes, such as
absentmindedly emptying a pan of skim milk into a basket of yarn balls
in the pantry instead of into the pigsâ€™ bucket, and walking clean over
the edge of the log bridge into the brook while wrapped in imaginative
reverie, not really being worth counting.

a week after the tea at the manse diana barry gave a party.

â€œsmall and select,â€ anne assured marilla. â€œjust the girls in our class.â€

they had a very good time and nothing untoward happened until after tea,
when they found themselves in the barry garden, a little tired of all
their games and ripe for any enticing form of mischief which might
present itself. this presently took the form of â€œdaring.â€

daring was the fashionable amusement among the avonlea small fry just
then. it had begun among the boys, but soon spread to the g

ss herself defeated.

josieâ€™s triumph being rather more pronounced than good taste permitted,
anne shirley dared her to walk along the top of the board fence which
bounded the garden to the east. now, to â€œwalkâ€ board fences requires
more skill and steadiness of head and heel than one might suppose who
has never tried it. but josie pye, if deficient in some qualities
that make for popularity, had at least a natural and inborn gift, duly
cultivated, for walking board fences. josie walked the barry fence with
an airy unconcern which seemed to imply that a little thing like that
wasnâ€™t worth a â€œdare.â€ reluctant admiration greeted her exploit, for
most of the other girls could appreciate it, having suffered many things
themselves in their efforts to walk fences. josie descended from her
perch, flushed with victory, and darted a defiant glance at anne.

anne tossed her red braids.

â€œi donâ€™t think itâ€™s such a very wonderful thing to walk a little, low,
board fence,â€ she said. â€

â€œi donâ€™t believe it,â€ said josie flatly. â€œi donâ€™t believe anybody could
walk a ridgepole. _you_ couldnâ€™t, anyhow.â€

â€œcouldnâ€™t i?â€ cried anne rashly.

â€œthen i dare you to do it,â€ said josie defiantly. â€œi dare you to climb
up there and walk the ridgepole of mr. barryâ€™s kitchen roof.â€

anne turned pale, but there was clearly only one thing to be done. she
walked toward the house, where a ladder was leaning against the kitchen
roof. all the fifth-class girls said, â€œoh!â€ partly in excitement, partly
in dismay.

â€œdonâ€™t you do it, anne,â€ entreated diana. â€œyouâ€™ll fall off and be
killed. never mind josie pye. it isnâ€™t fair to dare anybody to do
anything so dangerous.â€

â€œi must do it. my honor is at stake,â€ said anne solemnly. â€œi shall w

to the immense relief of all the girls, and especially of josie pye,
who, in spite of lack of imagination, had been seized with horrible
visions of a future branded as the girl who was the cause of anne
shirleyâ€™s early and tragic death, anne sat dizzily up and answered
uncertainly:

â€œno, diana, i am not killed, but i think i am rendered unconscious.â€

â€œwhere?â€ sobbed carrie sloane. â€œoh, where, anne?â€ before anne could
answer mrs. barry appeared on the scene. at sight of her anne tried to
scramble to her feet, but sank back again with a sharp little cry of
pain.

â€œwhatâ€™s the matter? where have you hurt yourself?â€ demanded mrs. barry.

â€œmy ankle,â€ gasped anne. â€œoh, diana, please find your father and ask him
to take me home. i know i can never walk there. and iâ€™m sure i couldnâ€™t
hop so far on one foot when jane couldnâ€™t even hop around the garden.â€

she saw mr. barry coming over the log bridge and up the slope, with mrs.

him. in his arms he carried anne, whose head lay limply against his
shoulder.

at that moment marilla had a revelation. in the sudden stab of fear that
pierced her very heart she realized what anne had come to mean to her.
she would have admitted that she liked anne--nay, that she was very fond
of anne. but now she knew as she hurried wildly down the slope that anne
was

dearer to her than anything else on earth.

â€œmr. barry, what has happened to her?â€ she gasped, more white and shaken
than the self-contained, sensible marilla had been for many years.

anne herself answered, lifting her head.

â€œdonâ€™t be very frightened, marilla. i was walking the ridgepole and i
fell off. i expect i have sprained my ankle. but, marilla, i might have
broken my neck. let us look on the bright side of things.â€

â€œi might have known youâ€™d go and do something of the sort when i let you

it was quite true. overcome by the pain of her injury, anne had one more
of her wishes granted to her. she had fainted dead away.

matthew, hastily summoned from the harvest field, was straightway
dispatched for the doctor, who in due time came, to discover that the
injury was more serious than they had supposed. anneâ€™s ankle was broken.

other girls wore. he recalled the cluster of little girls he had seen
around her that evening--all gay in waists of red and blue and pink
and white--and he wondered why marilla always kept her so plainly and
soberly gowned.

of course, it must be all right. marilla knew best and marilla was
bringing her up. probably some wise, inscrutable motive was to be served
thereby. but surely it would do no harm to let the child have one pretty
dress--something like diana barry always wore. matthew decided that
he would give her one; that surely could not be objected to as an
unwarranted putting in of his oar. christmas was only a fortnight off.
a nice new dress would be the very thing for a present. matthew, with a
sigh of satisfaction, put away his pipe and went to bed, while marilla
opened all the doors and aired the house.

dress, determined to get the worst over and have done with it. it would

we copied out four of our very best and sent them. miss josephine barry
wrote back that she had never read anything so amusing in her life. that
kind of puzzled us because the stories were all very pathetic and almost
everybody died. but iâ€™m glad miss barry liked them. it shows our club
is doing some good in the world. mrs. allan says that ought to be our
object in everything. i do really try to make it my object but i forget

anne had sat among the stumps and wept, not without an eye to the
romance of it; but she was speedily consoled, for, after all, as she and
diana said, big girls of thirteen, going on fourteen, were too old for
such childish amusements as playhouses, and there were more fascinating
sports to be found about the pond. it was splendid to fish for trout
over the bridge and the two girls learned to row themselves about in the
little flat-bottomed dory mr. barry kept for duck shooting.

it was anneâ€™s idea that they dramatize elaine. they had studied
tennysonâ€™s poem in school the preceding winter, the superintendent of
education having prescribed it in the english course for the prince
edward island schools. they had analyzed and parsed it and torn it to
pieces in general until it was a wonder there was any meaning at all
left in it for them, but at least the fair lily maid and lancelot and

but still--! altogether, anne rather thought it would be a relief to
sit down and have a good cry. she was really quite unstrung, for the
reaction from her fright and cramped clinging was making itself felt.

halfway up the path she met jane and diana rushing back to the pond in
a state narrowly removed from positive frenzy. they had found nobody at
orchard slope, both mr. and mrs. barry being away. here ruby gillis had
succumbed to hysterics, and was left to recover from them as best she
might, while jane and diana flew through the haunted wood and across the
brook to green gables. there they had found nobody either, for marilla
had gone to carmody and matthew was making hay in the back field.

â€œoh, anne,â€ gasped diana, fairly falling on the formerâ€™s neck
and weeping with relief and delight, â€œoh, anne--we thought--you
were--drowned--and we felt like murderers--because

fault. i feel sure i was born under an unlucky star. everything i do
gets me or my dearest friends into a scrape. weâ€™ve gone and lost your
fatherâ€™s flat, diana, and i have a presentiment that weâ€™ll not be
allowed to row on the pond any more.â€

anneâ€™s presentiment proved more trustworthy than presentiments are apt
to do. great was the consternation in the barry and cuthbert households
when the events of the afternoon became known.

â€œwill you ever have any sense, anne?â€ groaned marilla.

â€œoh, yes, i think i will, marilla,â€ returned anne optimistically. a good
cry, indulged in the grateful solitude of the east gable, had soothed
her nerves and restored her to her wonted cheerfulness. â€œi think my
prospects of becoming sensible are brighter now than ever.â€

â€œi donâ€™t see how,â€ said marilla.

â€œwell,â€ explained anne, â€œiâ€™ve learned a

of their english course the preceding winter and which miss stacy had
made them learn off by heart--and exulting in its rushing lines and the
clash of spears in its imagery. when she came to the lines

       the stubborn spearsmen still made good
       their dark impenetrable wood,

she stopped in ecstasy to shut her eyes that she might the better fancy
herself one of that heroic ring. when she opened them again it was to
behold diana coming through the gate that led into the barry field and
looking so important that anne instantly divined there was news to be
told. but betray too eager curiosity she would not.

â€œisnâ€™t this evening just like a purple dream, diana? it makes me so glad
to be alive. in the mornings i always think the mornings are best; but
when evening comes i think itâ€™s lovelier still.â€

â€œitâ€™s a very fine evening,â€ said diana, â€œbut oh, i have such news, anne.

 were over at carmody. it is
one of those little blue velvet ones that are all the rage, with gold
cord and tassels. your new hat is elegant, diana, and so becoming. when
i saw you come into church last sunday my heart swelled with pride to
think you were my dearest friend. do you suppose itâ€™s wrong for us to
think so much about our clothes? marilla says it is very sinful. but it
is such an interesting subject, isnâ€™t it?â€

marilla agreed to let anne go to town, and it was arranged that
mr. barry should take the girls in on the following tuesday. as
charlottetown was thirty miles away and mr. barry wished to go and
return the same day, it was necessary to make a very early start. but
anne counted it all joy, and was up before sunrise on tuesday morning.
a glance from her window assured her that the day would be fine, for
the eastern sky behind the firs of the haunted wood was all silvery
and cloudless. through the gap in the trees a light was shining in the
western gable of orchard slop

e, a token that diana was also up.

anne was dressed by the time matthew had the fire on and had the
breakfast ready when marilla came down, but for her own part was much
too excited to eat. after breakfast the jaunty new cap and jacket were
donned, and anne hastened over the brook and up through the firs to
orchard slope. mr. barry and diana were waiting for her, and they were
soon on the road.

it was a long drive, but anne and diana enjoyed every minute of it. it
was delightful to rattle along over the moist roads in the early red
sunlight that was creeping across the shorn harvest fields. the air was
fresh and crisp, and little smoke-blue mists curled through the valleys
and floated off from the hills. sometimes the road went through woods
where maples were beginning to hang out scarlet banners; sometimes it
crossed ri

half-delightful fear; sometimes it wound along a harbor shore and passed
by a little cluster of weather-gray fishing huts; again it mounted to
hills whence a far sweep of curving upland or misty-blue sky could be
seen; but wherever it went there was much of interest to discuss. it was
almost noon when they reached town and found their way to â€œbeechwood.â€
 it was quite a fine old mansion, set back from the street in a seclusion
of green elms and branching beeches. miss barry met them at the door
with a twinkle in her sharp black eyes.

â€œso youâ€™ve come to see me at last, you anne-girl,â€ she said. â€œmercy,
child, how you have grown! youâ€™re taller than i am, i declare. and
youâ€™re ever so much better looking than you used to be, too. but i dare
say you know that without being told.â€

â€œindeed i didnâ€™t,â€ said anne radiantly. â€œi know iâ€™m not so freckled as
i used to be, so iâ€™ve much to be thankful for, but i really hadnâ€™t dared
to hope there was

 any other improvement. iâ€™m so glad you think there is,
miss barry.â€ miss barryâ€™s house was furnished with â€œgreat magnificence,â€
 as anne told marilla afterward. the two little country girls were rather
abashed by the splendor of the parlor where miss barry left them when
she went to see about dinner.

â€œisnâ€™t it just like a palace?â€ whispered diana. â€œi never was in aunt
josephineâ€™s house before, and iâ€™d no idea it was so grand. i just wish
julia bell could see this--she puts on such airs about her motherâ€™s
parlor.â€

â€œvelvet carpet,â€ sighed anne luxuriously, â€œand silk curtains! iâ€™ve
dreamed of such things, diana. but do you know i donâ€™t believe i feel
very comfortable with them after all. there are so many things in this

one consolation when you are poor--there are so many more things you can
imagine about.â€

their sojourn in town was something that anne and diana dated from for
years. from first to last it was crowded with delights.

on wednesday miss barry took them to the exhibition grounds and kept
them there all day.

â€œit was splendid,â€ anne related to marilla later on. â€œi never imagined
anything so interesting. i donâ€™t really know which department was the
most interesting. i think i liked the horses and the flowers and the
fancywork best. josie pye took first prize for knitted lace. i was
real glad she did. and i was glad that i felt glad, for it shows iâ€™m
improving, donâ€™t you think, marilla, when i can rejoice in josieâ€™s

this when he was praying so solemnly. clara louise macpherson took a
prize for painting, and mrs. lynde got first prize for homemade butter
and cheese. so avonlea was pretty well represented, wasnâ€™t it? mrs.
lynde was there that day, and i never knew how much i really liked her
until i saw her familiar face among all those strangers. there
were thousands of people there, marilla. it made me feel dreadfully
insignificant. and miss barry took us up to the grandstand to see
the horse races. mrs. lynde wouldnâ€™t go; she said horse racing was an
abomination and, she being a church member, thought it her bounden duty
to set a good example by staying away. but there were so many there i
donâ€™t believe mrs. lyndeâ€™s absence would ever be noticed. i donâ€™t think,
though, that i ought to go very often to horse races, because they _are_
awfully fascinating. diana got so excited that she offered to bet me
ten cents that the red horse

an extra conscience to have a ministerâ€™s wife for your friend. and i was
very glad i didnâ€™t bet, because the red horse _did_ win, and i would have
lost ten cents. so you see that virtue was its own reward. we saw a man
go up in a balloon. iâ€™d love to go up in a balloon, marilla; it would
be simply thrilling; and we saw a man selling fortunes. you paid him ten
cents and a little bird picked out your fortune for you. miss barry gave
diana and me ten cents each to have our fortunes told. mine was that i
would marry a dark-complected man who was very wealthy, and i would go
across water to live. i looked carefully at all the dark men i saw after
that, but i didnâ€™t care much for any of them, and anyhow i suppose
itâ€™s too early to be looking out for him yet. oh, it was a
never-to-be-forgotten day, marilla. i was so tired i couldnâ€™t sleep at
night. miss barry put us in the spare room, according to promise. it

even talk, so you may know what it was like. i just sat in enraptured
silence. madame selitsky was perfectly beautiful, and wore white satin
and diamonds. but when she began to sing i never thought about anything
else. oh, i canâ€™t tell you how i felt. but it seemed to me that it could
never be hard to be good any more. i felt like i do when i look up to
the stars. tears came into my eyes, but, oh, they were such happy tears.
i was so sorry when it was all over, and i told miss barry i didnâ€™t see
how i was ever to return to common life again. she said she thought if
we went over to the restaurant across the street and had an ice cream
it might help me. that sounded so prosaic; but to my surprise i found
it true. the ice cream was delicious, marilla, and it was so lovely and
dissipated to be sitting there eating it at eleven oâ€™clock at night.
diana said she believed she was born for city life. miss barry asked
me what my opinion was, but i said i would have to think it o

er after i went to bed. that is the best time to think things out. and
i came to the conclusion, marilla, that i wasnâ€™t born for city life and
that i was glad of it. itâ€™s nice to be eating ice cream at brilliant
restaurants at eleven oâ€™clock at night once in a while; but as a regular
thing iâ€™d rather be in the east gable at eleven, sound asleep, but kind
of knowing even in my sleep that the stars were shining outside and that
the wind was blowing in the firs across the brook. i told miss barry
so at breakfast the next morning and she laughed. miss barry generally
laughed at anything i said, even when i said the most solemn things. i
donâ€™t think i liked it, marilla, because i wasnâ€™t trying to be funny.
but she is a most hospitable lady and treated us royally.â€

friday brought going-home time, and mr. barry drove in for the girls.

â€œwell, i hope youâ€™ve enjoyed yourselves,â€ said miss barry, as she bade
them good-bye.

â€œindeed we have,â€ said diana.

â€œand you, anne-girl?

â€œiâ€™ve enjoyed every minute of the time,â€ said anne, throwing her arms
impulsively about the old womanâ€™s neck and kissing her wrinkled cheek.
diana would never have dared to do such a thing and felt rather aghast
at anneâ€™s freedom. but miss barry was pleased, and she stood on her
veranda and watched the buggy out of sight. then she went back into her
big house with a sigh. it seemed very lonely, lacking those fresh young
lives. miss barry was a rather selfish old lady, if the truth must
be told, and had never cared much for anybody but herself. she valued
people only as they were of service to her or amused her. anne had
amused her, and consequently stood high in the old ladyâ€™s good graces.
but miss barry found herself thinking less about anneâ€™s quaint speeches
than of her fresh enthusiasms, her transparent emotions, her little
winning ways, and the sweetness of her eyes and lips.

â€œi thought marilla cuthbert was an old fo

should have a purpose in life and pursue it faithfully. only he says
we must first make sure that it is a worthy purpose. i would call it a
worthy purpose to want to be a teacher like miss stacy, wouldnâ€™t you,
marilla? i think itâ€™s a very noble profession.â€

the queenâ€™s class was organized in due time. gilbert blythe, anne
shirley, ruby gillis, jane andrews, josie pye, charlie sloane, and moody
spurgeon macpherson joined it. diana barry did not, as her parents
did not intend to send her to queenâ€™s. this seemed nothing short of a
calamity to anne. never, since the night on which minnie may had had the
croup, had she and diana been separated in anything. on the evening when
the queenâ€™s class first remained in school for the extra lessons and
anne saw diana go slowly out with the others, to walk home alone through
the birch path and violet vale, it was all the former could do to keep
her seat and refrain from rushing impulsiv

then, iâ€™m afraid; so iâ€™m going to believe in them with all my whole

school picnic and the missionary concert next month. and mr. barry says
that some evening heâ€™ll take diana and me over to the white sands hotel
and have dinner there. they have dinner there in the evening, you know.
jane andrews was over once last summer and she says it was a dazzling
sight to see the electric lights and the flowers and all the lady guests

mrs. lynde came up the next afternoon to find out why marilla had not
been at

walk with my arm about their waists, and call them nicknames. but just
now i donâ€™t know them and they donâ€™t know me, and probably donâ€™t want to
know me particularly. oh, itâ€™s lonesome!â€

it was lonesomer still when anne found herself alone in her hall bedroom
that night at twilight. she was not to board with the other girls, who
all had relatives in town to take pity on them. miss josephine barry
would have liked to board her, but beechwood was so far from the
academy that it was out of the question; so miss barry hunted up a
boarding-house, assuring matthew and marilla that it was the very place
for anne.

â€œthe lady who keeps it is a reduced gentlewoman,â€ explained miss barry.
â€œher husband was a british officer, and she is very careful what sort
of boarders she takes. anne will not meet with any objectionable persons
under her roof. the table is good, and the house is near the ac

ass at large, but somehow the bitterness had gone out of it. anne no
longer wished to win for the sake of defeating gilbert; rather, for the
proud consciousness of a well-won victory over a worthy foeman. it
would be worth while to win, but she no longer thought life would be
insupportable if she did not.

in spite of lessons the students found opportunities for pleasant times.
anne spent many of her spare hours at beechwood and generally ate her
sunday dinners there and went to church with miss barry. the latter was,
as she admitted, growing old, but her black eyes were not dim nor the
vigor of her tongue in the least abated. but she never sharpened the
latter on anne, who continued to be a prime favorite with the critical
old lady.

â€œthat anne-girl improves all the time,â€ she said. â€œi get tired of other
girls--there is such a provoking and eternal sameness about them. anne
has as many shades as a rainbow and every shade is the prettiest while
it lasts. i donâ€™t know that she is as a

 eyes and ears for only one student
on the platform--a tall girl in pale green, with faintly flushed
cheeks and starry eyes, who read the best essay and was pointed out and
whispered about as the avery winner.

â€œreckon youâ€™re glad we kept her, marilla?â€ whispered matthew, speaking
for the first time since he had entered the hall, when anne had finished
her essay.

â€œitâ€™s not the first time iâ€™ve been glad,â€ retorted marilla. â€œyou do like
to rub things in, matthew cuthbert.â€

miss barry, who was sitting behind them, leaned forward and poked
marilla in the back with her parasol.

â€œarenâ€™t you proud of that anne-girl? i am,â€ she said.

anne went home to avonlea with matthew and marilla that evening. she had
not been home since april and she felt that she could not wait another
day. the apple blossoms were out and the world was fresh and young.
diana was at green gables to meet her. in her own white room, where
marilla had set a flowering house rose on the window sill, anne

in his hand, and his face strangely drawn and gray. anne dropped her
flowers and sprang across the kitchen to him at the same moment as
marilla. they were both too late; before they could reach him matthew
had fallen across the threshold.

â€œheâ€™s fainted,â€ gasped marilla. â€œanne, run for martin--quick, quick!
heâ€™s at the barn.â€

martin, the hired man, who had just driven home from the post office,
started at once for the doctor, calling at orchard slope on his way to
send mr. and mrs. barry over. mrs. lynde, who was there on an errand,
came too. they found anne and marilla distractedly trying to restore
matthew to consciousness.

mrs. lynde pushed them gently aside, tried his pulse, and then laid her
ear over his heart. she looked at their anxious faces sorrowfully and
the tears came into her eyes.

â€œoh, marilla,â€ she said gravely. â€œi donâ€™t think--we can do anything for
him.â€

â€œmrs. lynde, you donâ€™t think--you canâ€™t think matthew is--is--â€ anne

w cuthbert in his coffin,
his long gray hair framing his placid face on which there was a little
kindly smile as if he but slept, dreaming pleasant dreams. there were
flowers about him--sweet old-fashioned flowers which his mother had
planted in the homestead garden in her bridal days and for which matthew
had always had a secret, wordless love. anne had gathered them and
brought them to him, her anguished, tearless eyes burning in her white
face. it was the last thing she could do for him.

the barrys and mrs. lynde stayed with them that night. diana, going to
the east gable, where anne was standing at her window, said gently:

â€œanne dear, would you like to have me sleep with you tonight?â€

â€œthank you, diana.â€ anne looked earnestly into her friendâ€™s face. â€œi
think you wonâ€™t misunderstand me when i say i want to be alone. iâ€™m not
afraid. i havenâ€™t been alone one minute since it happened--and i want to
be. i want to be quite silent and quiet and try to realize it. i canâ€™t

â€œnot going to redmond!â€ marilla lifted her worn face from her hands and
looked at anne. â€œwhy, what do you mean?â€

â€œjust what i say. iâ€™m not going to take the scholarship. i decided so
the night after you came home from town. you surely donâ€™t think i could
leave you alone in your trouble, marilla, after all youâ€™ve done for me.
iâ€™ve been thinking and planning. let me tell you my plans. mr. barry
wants to rent the farm for next year. so you wonâ€™t have any bother over
that. and iâ€™m going to teach. iâ€™ve applied for the school here--but i
donâ€™t expect to get it for i understand the trustees have promised it to
gilbert blythe. but i can have the carmody school--mr. blair told me
so last night at the store. of course that wonâ€™t be quite as nice or
convenient as if i had the avonlea school. but i can board home and
drive myself over to carmody and back, in the warm weather at least.

now that there are no pyes going. josie was the last of them, and a
good thing she was, thatâ€™s what. thereâ€™s been some pye or other going to
avonlea school for the last twenty years, and i guess their mission in
life was to keep school teachers reminded that earth isnâ€™t their home.

gable mean?â€

â€œdiana is signaling for me to go over,â€ laughed anne. â€œyou know we keep
up the old custom. excuse me while i run over and see what she wants.â€

anne ran down the clover slope like a deer, and disappeared in the firry
shadows of the haunted wood. mrs. lynde looked after her indulgently.

â€œthereâ€™s a good deal of the child about her yet in some ways.â€

â€œthereâ€™s a good deal more of the woman about her in others,â€ retorted
marilla, with a momentary return of her o

studies, arenâ€™t you? so am i. come, iâ€™m going to walk home with you.â€

marilla looked curiously at anne when the latter entered the kitchen.

â€œwho was that came up the lane with you, anne?â€

â€œgilbert blythe,â€ answered anne, vexed to find herself blushing. â€œi met
him on barryâ€™s hill.â€

â€œi didnâ€™t think you and gilbert blythe were such good friends that youâ€™d
stand for half an hour at the gate talking to him,â€ said marilla with a
dry smile.

â€œwe havenâ€™t been--weâ€™ve been good enemies. but we have decided that it
will be much more sensible to be good friends in the future. were we
really there half an hour? it seemed just a few minutes. but, you see,
we have five yearsâ€™ lost conversations to catch up with, marilla.â€
