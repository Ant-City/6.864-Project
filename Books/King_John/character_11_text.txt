  king philip. before angiers well met, brave austria.
    arthur, that great forerunner of thy blood,
    richard, that robb'd the lion of his heart
    and fought the holy wars in palestine,
    by this brave duke came early to his grave;
    and for amends to his posterity,

  arthur. god shall forgive you coeur-de-lion's death
    the rather that you give his offspring life,
    shadowing their right under your wings of war.
    i give you welcome with a powerless hand,
    but with a heart full of unstained love;
    welcome before the gates of angiers, duke.
  king philip. a noble boy! who would not do thee right?
  austria. upon thy cheek lay i this zealous kiss
    as seal to this indenture of my love:
    that to my home i will no more return
    till angiers and the right thou hast in france,

    whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides

    till your strong hand shall help to give him strength
    to make a more requital to your love!
  austria. the peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords
    in such a just and charitable war.
  king philip. well then, to work! our cannon shall be bent
    against the brows of this resisting town;
    call for our chiefest men of discipline,
    to cull the plots of best advantages.
    we'll lay before this town our royal bones,
