ook. he breathed heavily, and it was said that,
when he slept, his wives and children in their houses could hear
him breathe. when he walked, his heels hardly touched the ground
and he seemed to walk on springs, as if he was going to pounce on
somebody. and he did pounce on people quite often. he had a
slight stammer and whenever he was angry and could not get his
words out quickly enough, he would use his fists. he had no
patience with unsuccessful men. he had had no patience with his
father.

unoka, for that was his father's name, had died ten years ago. in
his day he was lazy and improvident and was quite incapable of
thinking about tomorrow. if any money came his way, and it
seldom did, he immediately bought gourds of palm-wine, called
round his neighbors and made merry. he always said that
whenever he saw a dead man's mouth he saw the folly of not eating
what one had in one's lifetime. unoka was, of course, a debtor, and
he owed every neighbor some money, from a few cowries to quite

bstantial amounts.

he was tall but very thin and had a slight stoop. he wore a haggard
and mournful look except when he was drinking or playing on his
flute. he was very good on his flute, and his happiest moments
were the two or three moons after the harvest when the village
musicians brought down their instruments, hung above the
fireplace. unoka would play with them, his face beaming with
blessedness and peace. sometimes another village would ask
unoka's band and their dancing egwugwu to come and stay with
them and teach them their tunes. they would go to such hosts for
as long as three or four markets, making music and feasting.
unoka loved the good hire and the good fellowship, and he loved
this season of the year, when the rains had stopped and the sun rose





every morning with dazzling beauty. and it was not too hot either,
because the cold and dry harmattan wind was blowing down irom
the north. some years the harmattan was very sever

e and a dense
haze hung on the atmosphere. old men and children would then sit
round log fires, warming their bodies. unoka loved it all, and he
loved the first kites that returned with the dry season, and the
children who sang songs of welcome to them. he would remember
his own childhood, how he had often wandered around looking for
a kite sailing leisurely against the blue sky. as soon as he found
one he would sing with his whole being, welcoming it back from
its long, long journey, and asking it if it had brought home any
lengths of cloth.

that was years ago, when he was young. unoka, the grown-up,
was a failure

. he was poor and his wife and children had barely
enough to eat. people laughed at him because he was a loafer, and
they swore never to lend him any more money because he never
paid back. but unoka was such a man that he always succeeded in
borrowing more, and piling up his debts.

one day a neighbor called okoye came in to see him. he was
reclining on a mud bed in his hut playing on the flute. he
immediately rose and shook hands with okoye, who then unrolled
the goatskin which he carried under his arm, and sat down. unoka
went into an inner room and soon returned with a small wooden
disc containing a kola nut, some alligator pepper and a lump of
white chalk.

"i have kola," he announced

when he sat down, and passed the disc
over to his guest.

"thank you. he who brings kola brings life. but i think you ought
to break it," replied okoye, passing back the disc.

"no, it is for you, i think," and they argued like this for a few
moments before unoka accepted the honor of breaking the kola.




okoye, meanwhile, took the lump of chalk, drew some lines on the
floor, and then painted his big toe.

as he broke the kola, unoka prayed to their ancestors for life and
health, and for protection against their enemies. when they had
eaten they talked about many things: about the heavy rains which
were drowning the yams, about the next ancestral feast and about
the impending war with the village of mbaino. unoka was never
happy when it came to wars. he was in fact a coward and could
not bear the sight of blood. and so he changed the subject and
talked about music, and his face beamed. he could hear in his
mind's ear the bl

ood-stirring and intricate rhythms of the ekwe and
the udu and the ogene, and he could hear his own flute weaving in
and out of them, decorating them with a colorful and plaintive tune.
the total effect was gay and brisk, but if one picked out the flute as
it went up and down and then broke up into short snatches, one
saw that there was sorrow and grief there.

okoye was also a musician. he played on the ogene. but he was
not a failure like unoka. he had a large barn full of yams and he
had three wives. and now he was going to take the idemili title,
the third highest in the land. it was a very expensive ceremony and
he was gathering all his resources together. that was in fact the
reason why he had come to see unoka. he cleared his throat and
began:

"thank you for the kola. you may have heard of the title i intend
to take shortly."

having spoken plainly so far, okoye said the next half a dozen
sentences in proverbs. among the ibo the

 art of conversation is
regarded very highly, and proverbs are the palm-oil with which
words are eaten. okoye was a great talker and he spoke for a long
time, skirting round the subject and then hitting it finally. in short,
he was asking unoka to return the two hundred cowries he had




borrowed from him more than two years before. as soon as unoka
understood what his friend was driving at, he burst out laughing.
he laughed loud and long and his voice rang out clear as the ogene,
and tears stood in his eyes. his visitor was amazed, and sat
speechless. at the end, unoka was able to give an answer between
fresh outbursts of mirth.

"look at that wall," he said, pointing at the far wall of his hut,
which was rubbed with red earth so that it shone. "look at those
lines of chalk," and okoye saw groups of short perpendicular lines
drawn in chal

k. there were five groups, and the smallest group had
ten lines. unoka had a sense of the dramatic and so he allowed a
pause, in which he took a pinch of snuff and sneezed noisily, and
then he continued: "each group there represents a debt to someone,
and each stroke is one hundred cowries. you see, i owe that man a
thousand cowries. but he has not come to wake me up in the
morning for it. i shall pay you, but not today. our elders say that
the sun will shine on those who stand before it shines on those who
kneel under them. i shall pay my big debts first." and he

 took
another pinch of snuff, as if that was paying the big debts first.
okoye rolled his goatskin and departed.

  when unoka died he had taken no title at all and he was heavily
in debt. any wonder then that his son okonkwo was ashamed of
him? fortunately, among these people a man was judged according
to his worth and not according to the worth of his father. okonkwo
was clearly cut out for great things. he was still young but he had
won fame as the greatest wrestler in the nine villages. he was a
wealthy farmer and had two barns full of yams, and had just
married his third wife. to crown it all he had taken two titl

lay deep within himself. it was the fear of himself, lest he
should be found to resemble his father. even as a little boy he had
resented his father's failure and weakness, and even now he still
remembered how he had suffered when a playmate had told him
that his father was agbala. that was how okonkwo first came to
know that agbala was not only another name for a woman, it could
also mean a man who had taken no title. and so okonkwo was
ruled by one passion - to hate everything that his father unoka had
loved. one of those things was gentleness and another was idleness.

during the planting season okonkwo worked daily on his farms
from cock-crow until the chickens went to roost. he was a very
strong man and rarely felt fatigue. but his wives and young
children were not as strong, and so they suffered. but they dared
not complain openly. okonkwo's first son, nwoye, was then



twelve years old but was already causing his father great anxiety
for his incipient laziness. at any rate, that wa

en taken out and handed over to a stranger. his mother had
wept bitterly, but he had been too surprised to weep. and so the
stranger had brought him, and a girl, a long, long way from home,
through lonely forest paths. he did not know who the girl was, and
he never saw her again.





chapter three

   okonkwo did not have the start in life which many young men
usually had. he did not inherit a barn from his father. there was no
barn to inherit. the story was told in umuofia, of how his father,
unoka, had gone to consult the oracle of the hills and the caves to
find out why he always had a miserable harvest.

the oracle was called agbala, and people came from far and near
to consult it. they came when misfortune dogged their steps or
when they had a dispute with their neighbors. they came to
discover what the future held for them or to consult the spirits of
their departed fathers.

the way into the shrine was a round hole at the side of a hill, just a
little bigger than the round opening i

will of the god. the fire did not burn with
a flame. the glowing logs only served to light up vaguely the dark
figure of the priestess.



sometimes a man came to consult the spirit of his dead father or
relative. it was said that when such a spirit appeared, the man saw
it vaguely in the darkness, but never heard its voice. some people
even said that they had heard the spirits flying and flapping their
wings against the roof of the cave.

many years ago when okonkwo was still a boy his father, unoka,
had gone to consult agbala. the priestess in those days was a
woman called chika. she was full of the power of her god, and she
was greatly feared. unoka stood before her and began his story.

"every year," he said sadly, "before 1 put any crop in the earth, i
sacrifice a cock to ani, the owner of all land. it is the law of our
fathers. i also kill a cock at the shrine of ifejioku, the god of yams.
i clear the bush and set fire to it when it is dry. i sow the yams
when the first rain has falle

n, and stake them when the young
tendrils appear. i weed – i”;  “hold your peace!" screamed the
priestess, her voice terrible as it echoed through the dark void.
"you have offended neither the gods nor your fathers. and when a
man is at peace with his gods and his ancestors, his harvest will be
good or bad according to the strength of his arm. you, unoka, are
known in all the clan for the weakness of your machete and your
hoe. when your neighbors go out with their ax to cut down virgin
forests, you sow your yams on exhausted farms that take no labor
to clear. they cross seven rivers to make their farms,- you stay at
home and offer sacrifices to a reluctant soil. go home and work
like a man."

unoka was an ill-fated man. he had a bad chi or personal god, and
evil fortune followed him to the grave, or rather to his death, for he




had no grave

hen a man was afflicted with swelling in the
stomach and the limbs he was not allowed to die in the house. he
was carried to the evil forest and left there to die. there was the
story of a very stubborn man who staggered back to his house and
had to be carried again to the forest and tied to a tree. the sickness
was an abomination to the earth, and so the victim could not be
buried in her bowels. he died and rotted away above the earth, and
was not given the first or the second burial. such was unoka's fate.
when they carried him away, he took with him his flute.

with a father like unoka, okonkwo did not have the start in life
which many young men had. he neither inherited a barn nor a title,
nor even a young wife. but in spite of these disadvantages, he had
begun even in his father's lifetime to lay the foundations of a
prosperous future. it was slow and painful. but he threw himself
into it like one possessed. and indeed he was possessed by the fear
of his father's contemptible life and

serable and rotting yams. one man tied
his cloth to a tree branch and hanged himself.

okonkwo remembered that tragic year with a cold shiver
throughout the rest of his life. it always surprised him when he
thought of it later that he did not sink under the load of despair. he
knew that he was a fierce fighter, but that year-had been enough to
break the heart of a lion.

"since i survived that year," he always said, "i shall survive
anything." he put it down to his inflexible will.

his father, unoka, who was then an ailing man, had said to him
during that terrible harvest month: "do not despair. 1 know you
will not despair. you have a manly and a proud heart. a proud
heart can survive a general failure because such failure does not
prick its pride. it is more difficult and more bitter when a man fails
alone."



unoka was like that in his last days. his love of talk had grown
with age and sickness. it tried okonkwo's patience beyond words.

children the while praying to the white man's god. if such a thing
were ever to happen, he, okonkwo, would wipe them off the face
of the earth.





okonkwo was popularly called the "roaring flame." as he looked
into the log fire he recalled the name. he was a flaming fire. how
then could he have begotten a son like nwoye, degenerate and
effeminate? perhaps he was not his son. no! he could not be. his
wife had played him false. he would teach her! but nwoye
resembled his grandfather, unoka, who was okonkwo's father. he
pushed the thought out of his mind. he, okonkwo, was called a
flaming fire. how could he have begotten a woman for a son? at
nwoye's age okonkwo had already become famous throughout
umuofia for his wrestling and his fearlessness.

he sighed heavily, and as if in sympathy the smoldering log also
sighed. and immediately okonkwo's eyes were opened and he saw
the whole matter clearly. living fire begets cold, impotent ash. he
sighed again, deeply.
