Mrs. Reed  - 
                Mrs.
Reed is Jane's cruel aunt, who raises her at Gateshead Hall until
Jane is sent away to school at age ten. Later in her life, Jane
attempts reconciliation with her aunt, but the old woman continues
to resent her because her husband had always loved Jane more than his
own children.
