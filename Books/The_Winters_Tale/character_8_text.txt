nine changes of the watery star hath been
the shepherd's note since we have left our throne
without a burden: time as long again
would be fill'd up, my brother, with our thanks;
and yet we should, for perpetuity,
go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,
yet standing in rich place, i multiply
with one we-thank-you many thousands more
that go before it.

                   stay your thanks a while,
and pay them when you part.

but my heart bleeds: and most accurs'd am i
to be by oath enjoin'd to this.--farewell!
the day frowns more and more:--thou'rt like to have
a lullaby too rough:--i never saw
the heavens so dim by day. a savage clamour!--

i would there were no age between ten and three-and-twenty, or
that youth would sleep out the rest; for there is nothing in the
between but getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,
stealing, fighting.--hark you now! would any but these boiled
brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty hunt this weather? they
have scared away two of my best sheep, which i fear the wolf will
sooner find than the master: if anywhere i have them, 'tis by
the sea-side, browsing of ivy.--

his name was antigonus, a nobleman.--but to make an end of the

sir, it is three days since i saw the prince. what his happier
affairs may be, are to me unknown; but i have missingly noted
he is of late much retired from court, and is less frequent to
his princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared.

polixenes.
i have considered so much, camillo, and with some care; so
far that i have eyes under my service which look upon his
removedness; from whom i have this intelligence,--that he is
seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd,--a man, they
say, that from very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his
neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.

camillo.
i have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a daughter of most
rare note: the report of her is extended more than can be
thought to begin from such a cottage.

                        sir, the year growing ancient,--
not yet on summer's death nor on the birth
of trembling winter,--the fairest flowers o' the season
are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,
which some call nature's bastards: of that kind
our rustic garden's barren; and i care not
to get slips of them.

whether it like me or no, i am a courtier. seest thou not the
air of the court in these enfoldings? hath not my gait in it the
measure of the court? receives not thy nose court-odour from me?
reflect i not on thy baseness court-contempt? think'st thou, for
that i insinuate, or toaze from thee thy business, i am therefore

none, sir; i have no pheasant, cock nor hen.

shepherd.
sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box which none
must know but the king; and which he shall know within this
hour, if i may come to the speech of him.

why, sir?

autolycus.
the king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a new ship to
purge melancholy and air himself: for, if thou beest capable of
things serious, thou must know the king is full of grief.

shepherd.
so 'tis said, sir,--about his son, that should have married a
shepherd's daughter.

autolycus.
if that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly: the curses he
shall have, the tortures he shall feel, will break the back of
man, the heart of monster.

clown.
think you so, sir?

autolycus.
not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and vengeance
bitter; but those that are germane to him, though removed fifty
times, shall all come under the hangman: which, though it be
great pity, yet it is necessary. an old sheep-whistling rogue, a
ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into grac

i was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old shepherd
deliver the manner how he found it: whereupon, after a little
amazedness, we were all commanded out of the chamber; only this,
methought i heard the shepherd say he found the child.

i would most gladly know the issue of it.

first gentleman.
i make a broken delivery of the business; but the changes i
perceived in the king and camillo were very notes of admiration.
they seem'd almost, with staring on one another, to tear the
cases of their eyes; there was speech in their

rrow wept to take leave of them; for
their joy waded in tears. there was casting up of eyes, holding
up of hands, with countenance of such distraction that they were
to be known by garment, not by favour. our king, being ready to
leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that joy
were now become a loss, cries 'o, thy mother, thy mother!' then
asks bohemia forgiveness; then embraces his son-in-law; then
again worries he his daughter with clipping her; now he thanks
the old shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten conduit
of many kings' reigns. i never heard of such another encounter,
which lames report to follow it, and undoes description to do it.

wrecked the same instant of their master's death, and in the

to expose the child were even then lost when it was found. but,
o, the noble combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in
paulina! she had one eye declined for the loss of her husband,
another elevated that the oracle was fulfilled: she lifted the
princess from the earth, and so locks her in embracing, as if she
would pin her to her heart, that she might no more be in danger
of losing.

now, had i not the dash of my former life in me, would preferment
drop on my head. i brought the old man and his son aboard the
prince; told him i heard them talk of a fardel and i know not
what; but he at that time over-fond of the shepherd's daughter,--
so he then took her to be,--who began to be much sea-sick, and
himself little better, extremity of weather continuing, this
mystery remained undiscover'd. but 'tis all one to me; for had i
been the finder-out of this secret, it would not have relish'd
among my other discredits. here come those i have done good to
against my will, and already appearing in the blossoms of their
fortune.

you are well met, sir: you denied to fight with me this other
day, because i was no gentleman born. see you these clothes? say
you see them not and think me still no gentleman born: you were
best say these robes are not gentlemen born. give me the lie, do;
and try whether i am not now a gentleman born.

i know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.

clown.
ay, and have been so any time these four hours.

shepherd.
and so have i, boy!

clown.
so you have:--but i was a gentleman born before my father; for
the king's son took me by the hand and called me brother; and
then the two kings called my father brother; and then the prince,
my brother, and the princess, my sister, called my father father;
and so we wept; and there was the first gentleman-like tears that
ever we shed.

we may live, son, to shed many more.
