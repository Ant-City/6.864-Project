mr.[CHARACTER] - 
                 emma's
father and the patriarch of hartfield, the[CHARACTER] estate. though
mr.[CHARACTER] is nervous, frail, and prone to hypochondria, he is
also known for his friendliness and his attachment to his daughter.
he is very resistant to change, to the point that he is unhappy
to see his daughters or emma's governess marry. in this sense, he
impedes emma's growth and acceptance of her adult destiny. he is
often foolish and clearly not emma's intellectual equal, but she
comforts and entertains him with insight and affection.
