this fact stood betweenâ€¦

they approached each other, carefully.

watching the boys vanish away, charles halloway suppressed a sudden urge to run with
them, make the pack. he knew what the wind was doing to them where it was taking them, to
all the secret places that were never so secret again in life.somewhere in him, a shadow
turned mournfully over.you had to run with a night like this, so the sadness could not hurt.
look! he thought. will runs because running is its own excuse. jim runs because something's
up ahead of him.
yet, strangely, they do run together.

it's good to know, thought will, it'll be running until dawn, winding up from nothing, winding
away to nothing, while we sleep.

'good-night.'
and they left him behind in a wind that very faintly smelled of licorice and cotton candy.

charles halloway put his hand to the saloon's double swing doors, hesitant, as if the grey
hairs on the back of his hand, like antennae, had felt something beyond slide by in the october
night.perhaps great fires burned somewhere and their furnace blasts warned him not to step
forth. or another ice age had loomed across the land, its freezing bulk might already have laid
waste a billion people in the hour.perhaps time itself fixed was draining off down an immense

or maybe it was only that man in a dark suit, seen through the saloon window, across the
street. great paper rolls under one arm, a brush and bucket in his free hand, the man was
whistling a tune, very far away.
it was a tune from another season, one that never ceased making charles halloway sad
when he heard it. the song was incongruous for october, but immensely moving,
overwhelming, no matter what day or what month it was sung:
i heard the bells on christmas day
their old, familiar carols play,
and wild and sweet
their words repeat great
of peace on earth, good will to men!
charles halloway shivered.suddenly there was the old sense of terrified elation, of wanting
to laugh and cry together when he saw the innocents of the earth wandering the snowy
streets the day before christma

s among all the tired men and women whose faces were dirty
with guilt, unwashed of sin, and smashed like small windows by life that hit without warning,
ran, hid, came back and hit again.
then pealed the bells more loud and deep:
'god is not dead, nor doth he sleep!
the wrong shall fail,
the right prevail,
with peace on earth, good will to men!'
the whistling died.
charles halloway stepped out. far up ahead, the man who had whistled the tune was
motioning his arms by a telegraph pole, silently working. now he vanished into the open door of
a shop.
charles halloway, not knowing why, crossed the street to watch the man pasting up one of
the posters inside the un-rented and empty store.
now the man stepped out the door with his brush, his paste bucket, his rolled papers. his
eyes, a fierce and lustful shine, fixed on charles halloway.smiling, he gestured an open hand.

the palm of that hand was covered with fine black silken hair. it looked like -
the hand clenched, tight. it waved. the man swept around the corner. charles halloway,
stunned, flushed with sudden summer heat, swayed, then turned to gaze into the empty shop.
two sawhorses stood parallel to each other under a single spotlight.
placed over these two sawhorses like a funeral of snow and crystal was a block of ice six
feet long. it shone dimly with its own effulgence, and its colour was light green-blue. it was a
great cool gem resting there in the dark.
on a little white placard at one side near the window the following calligraphic message
could be read by lam

the ice.and the lovely hollows, the horizontal flow of emptiness within the ice. the lovely
nothingness. the exquisite flow of an invisible mermaid daring the ice to capture it.
the ice was cold.
the emptiness within the ice was warm.
he wanted to go away from here.

and the two sawhorses and the cold waiting arctic coffin set there like a vast star of india in

his eyes were fastened to those black flags, the great side-show signs swarming with
unguessed wings, horns, and demon smiles.

jim jumped. jim gasped.
cloud shadows panicked them over the hills to the edge of town.
from there, the two boys ran alone.

the air was cold blowing in through the wide-open library window.
charles halloway had stood there for a long time.
now, he quickened.
along the street below fled two shadows, two boys above them matching shadow stride for
stride. they softly printed the night air with treads.
'jim!' cried the old man. 'will!'
but not aloud.
the boys went away towards home.
charles halloway looked out into the country.
wandering alone in the library, letting his broom tell him things no one else could hear, he
had heard the whistle and the disjointed-calliope hymns.
'three,' he now said, half

if a man stood here would he see himself unfolded away a billion times to eternity? would a
billion images look back, each face and the face after and the face after that old, older, oldest?
would he find himself lost in a fine dust away off deep down there, not fifty but sixty, not sixty
but seventy, not seventy but eighty, ninety, ninety-nine years old?
the maze did not ask.
the maze did not tell.
it simply stood and waited like a great arctic floe.
'three o'clockâ€¦'
charles halloway was cold. his skin was suddenly a lizard's skin. his stomach filled with blood
turned to rust. his mouth tasted of night damps.
yet he could not turn from the library window.
far off, something glittered in the meadow.
it was moonlight, flashing on a great glass.
perhaps the light said something, perhaps it spoke in code.
iâ€™ll go there, thought charles halloway, i won't go there.
i like it, he thought, i don't like it.
a moment later the library door slammed.

inside stood two abandoned sawhorses.
between lay a pool of water. in the water floated a few shards of ice. in the ice were a few
long strands of hair.
charles halloway saw but chose not to see. he turned and was gone. the street was soon
as empty as the hardware-store window.
far away, in the meadow, shadows flickered in the mirror maze, as if parts of someone's life,
yet unborn, were trapped there, waiting to be lived.
so the maze waited, its cold gaze ready, for so much as a bird to come look, see, and fly
away shrieking.
but no bird came.

no, he mustnâ€™t! will hunched himself. why not? he trembled. what did he fear?

yes. will buried himself, deep.yesâ€¦

three in the morning, thought charles halloway, seated on the edge of his bed. why did the
train come at that hour?
for, he thought, it's a special hour. women never wake then, do they? they sleep the sleep
of babes and children.but men in middle age? they know that hour well. oh god, midnight's
not bad, you wake and go back to sleep, one or two's not bad, you toss but sleep again. five or

the parade fell apart.
the freaks hurried half to one sidewalk, half to the other, mingling with the crowd, passing

the small boy's shadow cooled will's cheek.
the parade's over, he thought, now the search begins.

in ned's night spot, half a block from the cigar store, charles halloway, exhausted from no
sleep, too much thinking, far too much walking, finished his second coffee and was about to
pay when the sharp silence from the street outside made him uneasy. he sensed rather than
saw the mild intermingled disturbance as the parade melted among the sidewalk crowds. not
knowing why, charles halloway put his money away.
'warm it up again, ned?'
ned was pouring coffee when the door swung wide, someone entered, and splayed his right
hand lightly on the counter.

the two boys, boxed in light-slotted pit, hisstled their breath softly out through gritted teeth.
jim squeezed will's hand, tight, tight.
both waited for more eyes to stride along and rake the steel grille.
the blue-red-green tattooed eyes, all five of them, fell away from the counter top.
charles halloway, sipping his third coffee, turned slightly on the revolving stool.
the illustrated man was watching him.
charles halloway nodded.
the illustrated man did not nod or blink, but stared until the janitor wanted to turn away, but
did not, and simply gazed as calmly as possible at the impertinent intruder.

outside, will's father moved toward the library, stopped, moved toward the courthouse,
stopped, waited for some better sense to direct him, felt his pocket, missed his smokes, and
turned toward the united cigar store.
jim looked up, saw familiar feet, pale faces salt and pepper hair. 'will! your dad! call to him.
he'll help us!' will could not speak.
'i'll call to him!'

nervously, his mouth working, as if he didn't dare ask his needs from mr tetleyâ€¦
'oneâ€¦that isâ€¦one twenty-five cent cigar.'
'my god,' said mr tetley, above. 'the man's rich!'
charles halloway took his time removing the cellophane, waiting for some hint, some move
on the part of the universe to show him where he was going, why he had come back this way
for a cigar he did not really want. he thought he heard himself called, twice, glanced swiftly at
the crowds, saw clowns passing with handbills, then lit the cigar he did not want from the
eternal blue-gas flame that burned in a small silver jet pipe on the counter, and puffing smoke,
dropped the cigar band with his free hand, saw the

at which moment, one hundred feet away, the illustrated man came out of ned's night spot.

from the cafÃ© counter, five electric blue-inked eyes fixed mr halloway's memory.

compare to other bones in other half-similar people, 'the cooger-dark combined shows have
picked two local boys, two! to be our special guests during our celebratory visit!'

dad's tall. dad's very tall indeed.
still charles halloway did not look down at the grille but only at the small comets of splashed
red colour left on the sidewalk, trailed around the corner, dropped from the clenched hands of
the vanished mr dark. he was also gazing with surprise at himself, accepting the surprise, the
new purpose, which was half despair, half serenity, now that the incredible deed was done. let
no one ask why he had given his true name; even he could not assay and give its real weight.
now he could only read the numerals on the court

the town clock struck seven.
the echoes of the great chime wandered in the unlit halls of the library.
an autumn leaf, very crisp, fell somewhere in the dark.but it was only the page of a book,
turning.
off in one of the catacombs, bent to a table under a grass-green-shaded lamp, lips pursed,
eyes narrowed, sat charles halloway, his hands trembling the pages, lifting,rearranging the
books. now and then he hurried off to peer into the autumn night, watchful of the streets.
then again he came back to paper-clip pages, to inset papers, to scribble out quotations,
whispering to himself. his voice brought forth quick echoes from the library vaults:
'look here!'
'â€¦hereâ€¦!' said the night passages.
'this pictureâ€¦!'
'â€¦pictureâ€¦!' said the halls.
'and this!'
'â€¦thisâ€¦' the dust settled.

were jim and will, then, featured all angelic, pure, half-innocent, peering up through the
sidewalk at marching terror? did the boys represent the ideal for your woman, man, or child of
excellent bearing, colour,balance, and summer disposition?
converselyâ€¦charles halloway turned a pageâ€¦did the scurrying freaks, the illustrated
marvel, bear the foreheads of the irascible, the cruel, the covetous, the mouths of the lewd
and untruthful? the teeth of the crafty, the unstable, the audacious, the vainglorious, and
your murderous beast?
no. the book slipped shut. if faces were judged, the freaks were no worse than many he'd

but it was only his laughter walking back through the deep stacks on panther feet.
so when they talked again, it was still in whispers. deep forests, dark caves, dim churches,
half-lit libraries were all the same, they tuned you down, they dampened your ardour, they
brought you to murmurs and soft cries for fear of raising up phantom twins of your voice which
might haunt corridors long after your passage.
they reached the small room and circled the table on which charles halloway had laid out
the books, where he had read many hours, and for the first time looked in each other's faces
and saw a dreadful paleness, so did not comment.
'from the beginning.' will's father pulled out chairs.
'please.'
so, each taking his part, in their own good time, the boys told of the wandering-by lightningrod
salesman, the predictions of storms to come, the long-after-midnight train, the suddenly
inhabited meadow, the moonblown tents, the untouched but full-wept calliope, then the light

after a pause, both boys exhaled at once.
â€˜the autumn people,' said jim. 'that's them.sure!'
'then - ' will swallowed - 'does that make usâ€¦summer people?'
'not quite.' charles halloway shook his head. 'oh, you're nearer summer than me. if i was
ever a rare fine summer person, that's long ago. most of us are half-and-half. the august noon
in us works to stave off the november chills. we survive by what little fourth of july wits we've
stashed away.but there are times when we're all autumn people.'
'not you,' dad.
'not you, mr halloway!'
he turned quickly to see both appraising him, paleness next to paleness, hands on knees as
if to bolt.
'it's a way of speaking.easy, boys, i'm

he paused and looked at the two boys and their fine young faces.
'yes,' he said. 'very late in the game. to help you.'

every night-blind library window clattered with cold.
the man, the two boys, waited for the wind to pass away.
then will said: 'dad.you've always helped.'
'thanks, but it's not true.' charles halloway examined one very empty hand. 'i'm a fool.

us with such a burden again we have no choice, to laugh or cry. no other animal does either.
we do both, depending on the season and the need.somehow, i feel the carnival watches, to
see which we're doing and how and why, and moves in on us when it feels we're ripe.
charles halloway stopped, for the boys were watching him so intently he suddenly had to
turn, flushing, away.
'boy, mr halloway,' cried jim, softly. 'that's great. go on.'
'dad,' said will, amazed. 'i never knew you could talk.'
'you should hear me here late nights, nothing but talk! charles halloway shook his head.
'yes, you should've heard. i should've said more to you any day you name in the past. hell.
where was i? leading up to love, i think.yesâ€¦love.'
will looked bored, jim looked wary of the word.
and

these looks gave charles halloway pause.
what could he say that might make sense to them? could he say love was above all,
common cause, shared experience?
that was the vital cement, wasn't it? could he say how he felt about their all being here
tonight on this wild world running around a big sun which fell through a bigger space falling
through yet vaster immensities of space, maybe toward and maybe away from something?
could he say: we share this billon-mile-an-hour ride. we have common cause against the night.
you start with
 
 ___________________________
 
e,
common cause of mouth, eye, ear, tongue, hand, nose, flesh, heart, and soul.
butâ€¦how to say it?
'look,' he tried, 'put two men in a rail car, one a soldier, the other a farmer. one talks war, the
other wheat; and bore each other to sleep.but let one spell long-distance running, and if the
other once ran the mile, why, those men will run all night like boys, sparking a friendship up from
memory.so, all men have one business in common: women, and can talk that till sunrise and
beyond. hell.'
charles halloway stopped, flushed, self-conscious again, knowing vaguely there was a
target up ahead but not quite how to get there. he chewed his lips.
dad, don't stop, thought will. when you talk, it's swell in here.you'll save us. go on.
the man read his son's eyes, saw the same look in jim, and walked slowly around the table,
touching a night beast here, a clutch of ragged crones there, a star, a crescent moon, an
antique sun, an hourglass that told time with bone dust instead of sand.
'have i said anything

'is it bad?' he asked.
'bad?' cried will, angrily. 'bad.you ask that!?'
'calmly,' said will's father. 'a good question.part of that show looks just great.but the old
saying really applies: you can't get something for nothing. fact is, from them, you get nothing
for something. they make you empty promises, you stick our your neck and - wham!'
'where'd they come from?' asked jim. 'who are they?'
will went to the window with his father and they both looked out and charles halloway said,
to those far tents:
'maybe once it was just one man walking across europe, jingling his ankle bells, a lute on his
shoulder making a hunchbacked shadow, before columbus. maybe a man walked around in a
monkey skin a million years ago, stuffing himself with other people's unhappiness, chewed their
pain all day like spearmint gum, for the sweet savour., and trotted faster,revivified by personal
disaster. maybe this son after him refined his father's deadfalls, mantraps, bone-crunchers,

itchier for pain, sorrow, and sickness than the average man. we salt our lives with other
people's sins. our flesh to us tastes sweet.but the carnival doesn't care if it stinks by
moonlight instead of sun, so long as it gorges on fear and pain. that's the fuel, the vapour that
spins the carousel, the raw stuffs of terror, the excruciating agony of guilt, the screams from
real or imagined wounds. the carnival sucks that gas, ignites it, and chugs along its way.'
charles halloway took a breath, shut his eyes, and said:
'how do i know this? i don't! i feel it. i taste it. it was like old leaves burning on the wind two
nights ago. it was a smell like mortuary flowers. i hear that music. i hear what you tell me, and
half what you don't tell me. maybe i've always dreamt about such carnivals, and was just
waiting for it to come sols to see it once, and nod. now, that tent show plays my bones like a

charles halloway snorted.
â€˜good grief, how much have i said out loud, how much to myself, the last ten minutes?â€™
â€˜you,â€™ said jim, â€˜talk a lot.â€™
â€˜in what language, dammit!â€™ cried charles halloway, for suddenly it seemed he had done no
more than other nights walking exquisitely alone, deliciously propounding his ideas to halls
which echoed them once, then made them vanish forever. he had written books a lifetime, on
the, airs of vast rooms in vast buildings, and had it all fly out the vents. now i

wound up pen having to guess other people's wild sunrises and sad sunsets.you tell me,
you've seen her near. the pinhead? the sheep boy? the fire eater? the siamese twins,
good god, what were they? twins all bound up in tandem narcissism? we'll never know. they'll

now - some plan. where do we go from here?â€™
charles halloway placed forth a map of the town and drew in the location of the carnival
with a blunt pencil.
â€˜do we keep hiding out? no. with miss foley, and so many others involved, we just can't.
well, then, how do we attack so we won't be picked off first thing? what kind of weapons - â€˜
â€˜silver bullets.â€™ cried will suddenly.
â€˜heck, no!â€™ snorted jim. â€˜they're not vampires!â€™

a faint tide of wind flowed up along through the library corridors and into this room.
â€˜the front door,â€™ jim whispered. â€˜someone just opened it.â€™
far away, a gentle click. the draft that had for a moment stirred the boys' trouser cuffs and
blown the man's hair, ceased.
â€˜someone just closed it.â€™
silence.
just the great dark library with its labyrinths and hedgerow mazes of sleeping books.
â€˜someoneâ€™s inside.â€™
the boys half rose, bleating in the backs of their mouths.
charles halloway waited, then said one word, softly:
â€˜hide.â€™
â€˜we can't leave you - â€˜
â€˜hide.â€™
the boys ran and vanished in the dark maze. charles halloway then rigidly, slowly, breathing
in, breathing out, forced himself to sit back down, his eyes on the yellowed newspapers, to
wait, to wait, then againâ€¦ to wait some more.

a shadow moved among shadows.
charles halloway felt his soul submerge.
it took a long time for the, shadow and the man it escorted to come stand in the doorway of
the room. th

not one, not a hundred, but a thousand people with it to look in.
â€˜my name is dark,â€™ said the voice.
charles halloway let out two fistfuls of air.
â€˜better known as the illustrated man,â€™ said the voice. â€˜where are the boys?â€™
â€˜boys?â€™ will's father turned at last to appraise the tall man who stood in the door.
the illustrated man sniffed the yellow pollen that whiffed up from the ancient books as quite
suddenly will's father saw them laid out in full sight, leaped up, stopped, then began to close
them, one by one, as casually as possible.
the illustrated man pretended not to notice.

â€˜i wish i knew where they were.â€™ charles halloway started carrying the books to the shelves.
â€˜hell, if they knew you were here with free tickets, they'd shout for joy.â€™
â€˜would they?â€™ mr. dark let his smile melt like a white and pink paraffin candy toy he no longer
had appetite for.softly, he said, â€˜i could kill you.â€™
charles halloway nodded, walking slowly.
â€˜did you hear what i said?â€™ barked the illustrated man.
â€˜yes.â€™ charles halloway weighed the books, as if they were his judgment. â€˜but you won't kill
now.you're too smart.you've kept the show on the road a long time, being smart.â€™
â€˜so you've read a few papers and think you know all about us?â€™
â€˜no, not all. just enough to scare me.â€™
â€˜be more scared then,â€™ said the crowd of night-crawling illustrations locked under black
suiting, speaking through the

the blood banged at charles halloway's heart, knocked at his temples, tapped twice at his
wrists.
the witch, he thought.
his lips must have formed the words.
â€˜the witch.â€™ mr. dark nodded.
the other shelved the books, withholding one.
â€˜well, what have you there?â€™ mr. dark squinted. â€˜a bible? how very charming, how childish
and refreshingly old-fashioned.â€™
â€˜have you ever read it, mr. dark?â€™
â€˜read it! i've had every page, paragraph, and word read at me, sir!â€™ mr. dark took time to light
a cigarette and blow smoke

toward the no smoking sign, then at will's father. â€˜do you really
imagine that books can harm me? is naivetÃ© really your armor? here!â€™
and before charles halloway could move, mr. dark ran lightly forward and took the bible. he,
held it in his two hands.
â€˜aren't you surprised? see, i touch, hold, even read from it.â€™
mr. dark blew smoke on the pages as he riffled them.
â€˜do you expect me to fall away into so many dead sea scrolls of flesh before you? myths,
unfortunately, are just that. life, and by life i could mean so many fascinating things, goes on,
makes shift for itself, survives wildly, and i not the least wild among many.your king james and

down to look us over, lick their lips, and wonder about investing in our special securities.you
came, you prowled, and it wasn't just for curiosity. how old are you?â€™
charles halloway pressed his lips shut.
â€˜fifty?â€™ purred mr. dark. â€˜fifty-one?â€™ he murmured.
â€˜fifty-two? like to be younger?â€™
â€˜no!â€™
â€˜no need to yell.politely, please.â€™ mr. dark hummed, strolling the room,running his hand over
the books as if they were years to be counted. â€˜oh, it's nice to be young really. wouldn't forty
be nice, again? forty's ten years nicer than fifty, and thirty's twenty years nicer by an incredible
long shot.â€™
â€˜i won't listen!â€™ charles halloway shut his eyes.

charles halloway hunched away, half crouched, propped hard against the shelves, grinding
his teeth to drown the sound of counting.
â€˜you're losing out, old man, my dear old fellow,â€™ said mr. dark. â€˜five. losing.six. losing very
much.seven. really losing.eight. frittering away. nine. ten. my god, you fool! eleven.

mr. dark stood in the door now, on his way out.
â€˜stay there,â€™ he directed. â€˜listen to your heart. i'll send someone to fix it.but, first, the boysâ€¦â€™
the crowd of unsleeping creatures, saddled upon tall flesh, strode quietly forth into
darkness, borne with and all over upon mr. dark. their cries and whines and utterances of
vague but excruciating excitements sounded in his husky summoning:
â€˜boys? are you there? wherever you areâ€¦ answer.â€™
charles halloway sprang forward, then felt the room spin and whirl him, as that soft, that
easy, that most pleasant voice of mr. dark went calling through the dark. charles halloway fell
against a chair, thought: listen, my heart! sank down to his knees, he said, listen to my heart!
it explodes! oh god, it's tearing free! - and could not follow.
the illustrated man trod cat-soft in the labyrinths of shelved and darkly waiting books.

in the far room, charles halloway, seated, his heart pounding, heard and thought, he won't
find them, i won't move unless he does, he can't find them, they won't listen! they won't
believe! he'll go away!
â€˜your mother, will,â€™ called mr. dark, softly. â€˜around and around, can you guess which direction,

mr. dark circled his thin ghost hand in the dark air between the stacks.
â€˜around, around, and when we let your mother off, boy, and showed her herself in the mirror

twisting, he fell-jumped to the floor.
the boys, kicking, yelling, fell with him. they landed on their feet, toppled, collapsed, to be
held,reared, set right, fistfuls of their shirts in mr. dark's fists.
â€˜jim!â€™ he said. â€˜will! what were you doing up there, boys? surely not reading?â€™
â€˜dad!â€™
â€˜mr. halloway!â€™
will's father stepped from the dark.
the illustrated man rearranged the boys tenderly under one arm like kindling, then gazed
with genteel curiosity at charles halloway and reached for him. will's father struck one blow
before his left hand was seized, held, squeezed.as the boys watched, shouting, they saw
charles halloway gasp and fall to one knee.
mr. dark squeezed that left hand harder and, doing this, slowly, certainly, pressured the boys
with his other arm, crushing their ribs so air gushed from their mouths.
night spiraled in fiery whorls like great thumbprints inside will's eyes.
will's father, groaning, sank to both knees, flailing his right arm.

â€˜not words, old man,â€™ said mr. dark. â€˜not words in books or words you say, but real thoughts,
real actions, quick thought, quick action, win the day.so!â€™
he gave one last mighty clench of his fist.
the boys heard charles halloway's finger bones crack. he gave a last cry and fell senseless.
in one motion like a solemn pavane, the illustrated man rounded the stacks, the boys, kicking
books from shelves, under his arms.
will, feeling walls, books, floors fly by, foolishly thought, pressed closeâ€¦ why, why, mr. dark
smells likeâ€¦ calliope steam!
both boys were dropped suddenly.before they could move or regain their breath, each was
gripped by the hair on their head and roused marionettes-wise to face a window, a street.

the dwarf toddled madly about in the boys' shadows, nibbling daintily at their fingernails,
softly calling their names.
the illustrated man nodded toward the library. â€˜the janitor's clock.stop it.â€™
the witch, mouth wide, savoring doom, wandered off into the marble quarry.
mr. dark said: â€˜left,right. one, two.â€™
the boys walked down the steps, the dwarf at jim's side, the skeleton at will's.
serene as death, the illustrated man followed.
44
somewhere near, charles halloway's hand lay in a white-hot furnace, melted to sheer nerve
and pain. he opened his eyes.at the same moment he heard a great breath as the front door
swung shut and a woman's voice came singing in the hall:
â€˜old man, old man, old man, old manâ€¦?â€™
where his left hand should be was this swelled blood pudding which pulsed with such
ecstasies of pain it fed forth his life, his will, his whole attention. he tried to sit up, but the pain
hammerblowed him down again â€˜old manâ€¦?â€™
not old! fifty-

four's not old, he thought wildly.
and here she came on the worn stone floors, her moth-fingers tapping, scanning braille book
titles, as her nostrils siphoned the shadows.
charles halloway hunched and crawled, hunched and crawled, toward the nearest stack,
cramming pain back with his tongue. he must climb out of reach, climb where books might be

â€˜old man, hear you breathing..

â€˜much more slow, slowâ€¦â€™ she suggested.
tired, yes, you hear that, heart? he wondered.
his heart heard. like a tight fist it began to relax, a finger at a time.
â€˜stop all for good, forget all for good,â€™ she whispered.
well why not?
â€˜slowerâ€¦ slowest.â€™
his heart stumbled.
and then for no reason, save perhaps for a last look around, because he did want to get rid
of the pain, and sleep was the way to do thatâ€¦ charles halloway opened his eyes.
he saw the witch.
he saw her fingers working at the air, his face, his body, the heart within his body, and the
soul within the heart. her swamp breath flooded him while, with immense curiosity, he watched
the poisonous drizzle from her lips, counted the folds in her stitch-wrinkled eyes, the gila
monster neck, the mummy-linen ears, the dry-rivulet riversand brow. never in his life had he
focused so nearly to a person, as if she were a puzzle, which once touched together might

diddle-tickle went her fingers.
charles halloway snorted. faintly, he giggled.
he caught this. why? why am iâ€¦ gigglingâ€¦ at such a time!?
the witch pulled back the merest quarter inch as if some strange but hidden electric light
socket, touched with wet whorl, gave shock.
charles halloway saw but did not see her flinch, sensed but seemed in no way to consider
her withdrawal, for almost immediately, seizing the initiative, she flung herself forward, not
touching, but mutely gesticulating at his chest as one might try to spell an antique clo

more grotesque than this thing named witch gypsy reader-of-dust, tickling, that's what! just
tickling the air! fool! didn't she know what she was doing! he opened his mouth.
of itself, like a child born of an unsuspecting parent, one single raw laugh broke free.
the witch swooned back.
charles halloway did not see. he was far too busy letting the joke rush through his fingers,
letting hilarity spring forth of its own volition along his throat, eyes squeezed shut; there it flew,
whipping shrapnel in all directions.
â€˜you!â€™ he cried, to no one, everyone, himself, her, them, it, all. â€˜funny! you!â€™
â€˜no,â€™ the witch protested.
â€˜stop tickling!â€™ he gasped.

â€˜no tickling is all it is, for sure,â€™ he roared. â€

mr. dark nodded swiftly.
â€˜since there are no volunteers -â€˜ he scraped his illustrated wrist. the witch shuddered. â€˜we
will cancel our last act and - â€˜
â€˜here! a volunteer!â€™
the crowd turned.
mr. dark recoiled., then asked: â€˜where?â€™
â€˜here.â€™
far out at the edge of the crowd, a hand lifted, a path opened.
mr. dark could see very clearly the man standing there, alone.
charles halloway, citizen, father, introspective husband, night-wanderer, and janitor of the
town library.
47
the crowd's appreciative clamor faded.
charles halloway did not move.
he let the path grow leading down to the platform.
he could not see the expression on the faces of the freaks standing up there. his eyes
swept the crowd and found the mirror maze, the empty oblivion which beckoned with ten times
a thousand million light years of reflections, counterreflections,,reversed and double-reversed,
plunging

deep to nothing, face-falling to nothing, stomach-dropping away to yet more
sickening plummets of nothing.
and yet, wasn't there an echo of two boys in the powdered silver at the back of each glass?
did or did he not perceive, with the tremulous tip of eyelash if not the eye, their passage
through, their wait beyond, warm wax amongst cold, waiting to be key-wound by terrors,run
free in panics?
no. thought charles halloway, don't think. get on with this!
â€˜coming!â€™ he shouted.
â€˜go get 'em,pop!â€™ a man said.
â€˜yes,â€™ said charles halloway. â€˜i will.â€™
and he walked down through the crowd.
the witch spun slowly, magnetized at the night-wandering volunteer's approach. her
eyelids jerked at their sewn black-wax threads behind dark glasses.
mr. dark, the illustration-drenched, superinfested civilization of souls, leaned from the
platform, gladly whetting his lips. thoughts spun fiery catherine wheels in his

eyes, quick, quick,
what, what, what!
and the aging janitor, fixing a smile to his face like a white celluloid set of teeth from a
cracker jack box, strode on, and the crowd opened as the sea before moses and closed
behind, and him wondering what to do? why was he here? but on the move, steadily,
nevertheless.
charles halloway's foot touched the first step of the platform.
the witch trembled secretly.
mr. dark felt this secret, glanced sharply.swiftly he put his hand out to grab for the good
right hand of this fifty-four-year-old man.
but the fifty-four-year-old man shook his head, would not give his hand to be held, touched,
or helped up.
â€˜thanks, no.â€™
on the platform, charles halloway waved to the crowd.
the people set off a few firecrackers of applause.
â€˜but -â€™ mr. dark was amazed - â€˜your left hand, sir,

charles halloway paled.
â€˜i'll do it,â€™ he said. â€˜with one hand.â€™
â€˜hoorah!â€™ cried a boy, below.
â€˜go it, charlie!â€™ a man called, out beyond.
mr. dark flushed as the crowd laughed and applauded even louder now. he lifted his hands
to ward off the wave of refreshing sound, like rain that washed in from the people.
â€˜all right, all right! let's see if he can do it!â€™
brutally, the illustrated man snapped a rifle from its locks, hurled it through the air.
the crowd gasped.
charles halloway ducked. he

rashed, and went back down the shore, he looked
again to the maze, where the sensed but unseen shadow-shapes of will and jim were filed
among titanic razor blades of revelation and illusion, then back to the medusa gaze of mr. dark,
swiftly reckoned with, and on to the stitched and jittering sightless nun of midnight, sidling back
still more. now she was as far as she could sidle, at the far end of the platform, almost pressed
to the whorled red-black rifle bull's-eye target.
â€˜boy!â€™ shouted charles halloway.
mr. dark stiffened.
â€˜i need a boy volunteer to help me hold the rifle!â€™ shouted charles halloway.
â€˜someone! anyone!â€™ he shouted.
a few boys in the crowd shifted around on their toes.
â€˜boy!â€™ shouted charles halloway. â€˜hold on. my son's out there. he'll volunteer, won't you, will?â€™
the witch flung one band up to feel the shape of this audacity which came off the fifty-fouryear-old
man like a fever. mr. dark was spun round as if hit by a fast-traveling gunshot.
â€˜will!â€™ called

mr. dark smiled.

mr. dark smiled more.
â€˜willy! don't you hear your old man?â€™
mr. dark stopped smiling.
for this last was the voice of a gentleman in the, crowd, speaking up.
the crowd laughed.
â€˜will!â€™ called a woman.
â€˜willy!â€™ called another.
â€˜yoohoo!â€™ a gentleman in a beard.
â€˜come on, william!â€™ a boy.
the crowd laughed more, jostled elbows.
charles halloway called. they called. charles halloway cried to the hills. they cried to the
hills.
â€˜will! willy! william!â€™
a shadow shuttled and wove in the mirrors.
the witch broke out chandeliers of sweat.
â€˜there!â€™
the crowd stopped calling.
as did charles halloway, choked on the name of his son now, and silent.
for will stood in the entrance of the maze, like the wax figure that he almost was.

the sound of this chimed the sweat off the witch.

and handing the rifle down like a cane for the boy to grasp, his father drew him up onto the
stand.
â€˜here's my good left hand!â€™ announced the father.
will neither saw nor heard the crowd sound forth a solid and offensive applause.
mr. dark had not moved, though charles halloway could see him, during all this, lighting and
setting off cannon crackers in his head; but each, one by one, fizzled and died. mr. dark could
not guess what they were up to. for that matter, charles halloway did not know or guess. it
was as if he had written this play for himself, over the years, in the library, nights, torn up the
play after memorizing it, and now forgotten what he had set forth to remember. he was relying
on secret discoveries of self, moment by moment, playing by ear, no! heart and soul!
andâ€¦now?!
the brightness of his teeth seemed to strike the witch blinder! impossible! she flung one
hand to her glasses, her sewn eyelids!

the witch melted in her rags.
the illustrated man looked left, found no pleasure in the skeleton, who simply looked thinner;
found no pleasure looking right to a dwarf who blandly dwelt in squashed idiot madness.
â€˜the bullet, please!â€™ will's father said, amiably.
the thousand illustrations on his jerking horseflesh frame did not hear, so why should mr.
dark?
â€˜if you please,â€™ said charles halloway. â€˜the bullet? so i may knock that flea off the old
gypsy's wart!â€™
will stood motionless.
mr. dark hesitated.
out in the choppy sea, smiles flashed, here, there, a hundred, two hundred, three hundred
whitenesses, as if a vast titillation of water had been provoked by a lunar gravity. the tide
ebbed.
the illustrated man, in slow motion, proffered the bullet. his arm, a long molasses undulation,
lazed to offer the bullet to the boy, to see if he would notice; he did not notice.
his father took

 the missile.
â€˜mark it with your initials,â€™ said mr. dark, by rote.
â€˜no, with more!â€™ charles halloway raised his son's hand and made him hold the bullet, so he
could take a penknife with his one good hand and carve a strange symbol on the lead.
what's happening? will thought. i know what's happening. i don't know what's happening?
what!?
mr. dark saw a crescent moon on the bullet, saw nothing wrong with such a moon,rammed it
in the rifle, slapped the rifle back at will's father, who once more caught it deftly.
â€˜ready, will?â€™
the boy's peach face drowsed in the slightest nod.

 was a substitute bullet,
shaped of a very hard steel-colored crayon wax.shot through the rifle it would dissolve out the
barrel as smoke and vapor.at this very moment, having somehow switched bullets, the
illustrated man was slipping the real marked bullet into the witch's jerking fingers.she would
hide it in her cheek.at the shot, she would pretend to jolt under the imagined impact, then
reveal the bullet caught by her yellow rat teeth. fanfare! applause!
the illustrated man, glancing up, saw charles halloway with the opened rifle, the wax bullet.
but instead of revealing what he knew, mr. halloway simply said, â€˜let's cut our mark more
clearly, eh, boy?â€™ and with his penknife, the boy holding the bullet in his senseless hand, he
marked this fresh new wax unmarked bullet with the same mysterious crescent moon, then
snapped it back into the rifle.
â€˜ready?!â€™
mr. dark looked to the witch.
who hesitated, then nodded, once, faintly.

carnival to have its way with boys and janitor trapped if possible, and alone.
â€˜will,â€™ said charles halloway conversationally, as he lifted the now suddenly heavy rifle. â€˜your
shoulder here is my brace. take the middle of the rifle, gently, with one hand. take it, will.â€™ the
boy raised a hand. â€˜that's it, son. when i say 'hold,' hold your breath. hear me?â€™
the boy's head tremored with the slightest affirmation.

quickly the fifty-four-year-old janitor, denying each year, laid the rifle back on the boy's
jerking shoulder.

mr. dark tightened his fist.

and the boy grew very calm indeed, with the rifle on his shoulder, and mr. dark squeezed
tight on the peach-fuzz face nestled in the flesh of his hand, but the boy was serene in the
laughter which still flowed and his father kept the hoop rolling thus:
â€˜show the lady your teeth, will!â€™
will showed the woman against the target his teeth. the blood fell away from the witch's f
ace.
now charles halloway showed her his teeth, too, such as they were.
and winter lived in the witch.

chamber, and what could a wax bullet do? a bullet tha

he felt his mouth shape words with no sound.
but, the witch heard what he said.
above the dying laughter, before the warm sound was completely goes, he made these
words, silently with his lips:
the crescent moon i have marked on the bullet is not a crescent moon.
it is my own smile.
i have put my smile on the bullet in the rifle.
he said it once.
he waited for her to understand.
he said it, silently, again.
and in the moment before the illustrated man himself translated the mouthings, quickly,
charles halloway cried, faintly, â€˜hold!â€™ will held his breath. far back among wax statues, jim, hid
away, dripped saliva from his chin.strapped in electric chair a dead-alive mummy hummed
power in its teeth. mr. dark's illustrations writhed with sick sweat as he clenched his fist a final
time, but - too late! serene, will held breath, held weapon.serene, his father said, â€˜now.â€™
and fired the rifle.

as did mr. dark.
as did all the freaks.
as did the crowd.
the witch screamed.
jim among the wax dummies, blew all the air from his lungs.
will shrieked himself awake, on the platform.
the illustrated man let the air from his mouth in a great angry bray, whipping up his hands to
stop all events.but the witch fell.she fell off the platform.she fell in the dust.
the smoking rifle in his one good hand, charles halloway let his breath go slow, feeling every
bit of it move from him. he still stared along the rifle sights at the target where the woman had
been.
at the platform rim, mr. dark looked down at the screaming crowd and what they were
screaming about.
â€˜she's fainted -â€™
â€˜no.she slipped!â€™
â€˜sheâ€™sâ€¦ shot!â€™
at last charles halloway came to stand by the illustrated man, looking down. there were
many things in his face: surprise, dismay, and some small strange relief and satisfaction.
the woman 
 
 ___________________________
 
she was dead. in a moment, the crowd would know. he watched the illustrated
man's hand move down to touch, trace, feel for life. then mr. dark lifted both her hands, like a
doll, in some marionette strategy, to give her motion.but the body refused.
so he gave one of the witch's arms to the dwarf, the other to the skeleton, and they shook
and moved them in a ghastly semblance of reawakening as the crowd backed.
â€˜â€¦ deadâ€™
â€˜butâ€¦ there's no wound.â€™
â€˜shock, you think? â€˜
shock, thought charles halloway, my god, did that kill her? or the other bullet? when i fired
the shot, did she suck the other bullet down her throat? did sheâ€¦ choke on my smile! oh,
christ!
â€˜it's all right! show's over! just fainted!â€™ said mr. dark. â€˜all an act! all part of the, show,â€™ he
said, not looking at the woman, not looking at the crowd, but looking at will, who stood blinking
around, out of one nightmare and fresh into the next as his father stood with him and mr. dark
cried: â€˜everyone home! show's over!

whistling, simpering, and the crowd, like a shake of leaves from one huge tree, blew off the
midway, and will's father stood facing the glass tides, the waves, the gauntlet of horror he
knew waited for him to swim through, stride through to fight the desiccation, the annihilation of
one's self that waited there. he had seen enough to know.eyes shut, you'd be lost.eyes open,
you'd know such utter despair, such gravities of anguish would weight you, you might never
drag past the twelfth turn.but charles halloway took will's hands away. â€˜jim's there. jim, wait!
i'm coming in!â€™
and charles halloway took the next step into the maze.
ahead flowed sluices of silver light, deep slabs of shadow, polished, wiped,rinsed with
images of themselves and others whose souls, passing, scoured the glass with their agony,
curried the cold ice with their narcissism, or sweated the angles and flats with their fear.

the stampede was close!
they had come running. now, fixed by light, they widened their eyes, as did dad, amazed
their mouths at their own ancient quakes and masquerades. halt! the match had cried.and
platoons left, squads right, had stilt-muscled themselves to fitful rest, to baleful glare, itching
for the match to whiff out. then, given lease to run next time, they'd hit this old, very old, much
older, terribly old man, suffocate him with fates in one instant.
â€˜no!â€™ said charles halloway.
no.a million dead lips moved.
will thrust the match forward. in the mirrors, a wizened multiplication of boy-apes did
likewise, posing a single rosebud of blue-yellow flame.
â€˜no!â€™
every glass threw javelins of light which invisibly pierced, sank deep, found heart, soul, lungs,
to frost the veins, cut nerves, send will to ruin, paralyze and then kick-football heart.
hamstrung, the old old man foundered to his knees, as did his suppliant images, his
congregation of terrified selves one week,

 one month, two years, twenty, fifty, seventy, ninety
years from now! every second, minute, and long-after-midnight hour of his possible survival into
insanity, there all sank grayer, more yellow as the mirrors ricocheted him through, bled him
lifeless, mouthed him dry, then threatened to whiff him to skeletal dusts and litter his moth
ashes to the floor.
â€˜no!â€™
charles halloway struck the match from his son's hand. â€˜dad, don't.â€™
for in the new dark, the restive herd of old men shambled forward, hearts hammering.
â€˜dad, we gotta see!â€™
he struck his second and final match.
and in the flare saw dad sunk down, eyes clenched, fists tight, and all those other men who
would have to shunt, crawl, scramble on knees once this last light was gone. will grabbed his
father's shoulder and shook him.
â€˜oh, dad, dad, i don't care how old you are, ever! i don't care what, i do
 
 ___________________________
 
n't care anything! oh,
dad,â€™ he cried, weeping. â€˜i love you!â€™
at which charles halloway opened his eyes and saw himself and the others like himself and
his son behind holding him, the flame trembling, the tears trembling on his face, and suddenly,
as before, the image of the witch, the memory of the library, defeat for one, victory for another,
swam before him, mixed with sound of rifle, shot, flight of marked bullet, surge of fleeing crowd.
for only a moment longer he looked at all of himselves, at will.a small sound escaped his
mouth.a little larger sound escaped his mouth.

he opened his mouth very wide, and let the loudest sound of all free.
the witch, if she were alive, would have known that sound, and died again.

the illustrated man, somewhere among the black tents,running, stopped.

the skeleton turned.

not the sound that charles halloway made, no.
but the terrific sounds that followed.
one mirror alone, and then a second mirror, followed by a pause, and then a third mirror, and
a fourth and another after that and another after that and still another and another after that,
in domino fashion, they formed swift spiderwebs over their fierce stares and then with faint
tinkles and sharp cracks, fell.
one minute there was this incredible jacob's ladder of glass, folding,refolding and folding
away yet again images pressed in a book of

the illustrated man, halted, listening, felt his own eyes, crystal, almost spiderweb and splinter
with the sounds.
it was as if charles halloway, once more a choirboy in a strange sub-sub-demon church had
sung the most beautiful high note of amiable humor ever in his life which first shook moth-silver
from the mirror backs, then shook images from glass faces, then shook glass itself to ruin.a
dozen, a hundred, a thousand mirrors, and with them the ancient images of charles halloway,
sank earthward in delicious moonfalls of snow and sleety water.

l because he accepted everything at last, accepted the carnival, the hills beyond, the
people in the hills, jim, will, and above all himself and all of life, and, accepting, threw back his
head for the second time tonight and showed his acceptance with sound.
and lo! like jericho and the trump, with musical thunders the glass gave up its ghosts,
charles halloway cried out,released. he took his hands from his face. fresh starlight and dying
carnival glow rushed in to set him free. the reflected dead men were gone, buried under the
cymbaled slide, the splash and surfing of glass at his feet.
â€˜lightsâ€¦ lights!â€™
a far voice cried away more warmth.
the illustrated man, unfrozen, vanished among the tents.
the crowd was now gone.

and thenâ€¦
there arose a human barking, yapping, baying, whining, as if all had fallen. in a long-drawn
moan, a gasp, a shuddering sigh, an entire crowd of people with crippled throats made chorus
together.
â€˜jim! they've got jim!â€™
â€˜noâ€¦â€™ murmured charles halloway, strangely. â€˜maybe jimâ€¦ or usâ€¦ got them.â€™
they stepped around the last tent.

leaves, a prickling blue that teemed and sifted to earth.swarming its own shadows, the dust
filtered over the tents.
charles halloway sneezed. figures jumped and scurried away from an upended, half-tilted
object abandoned half-way between one tent and the carousel.

â€˜what must have been him?â€™

spice, the autumn incense that had floured them when they turned this comer.
kill or cure, charles halloway thought. he imagined them rushed in the last few seconds,
toting the ancient dustsack boneheap over starched grasses in his disconnected chair,
perhaps only one in a running series of attempts to foster, encourage, preserve life in what was
really nothing but a mortuary junkpile,rust-flakes and dying coals that no wind could blow
alight again.yet they must try. how many times in the last twenty-four hours had they run out
on such excursions, only, in panic, to cease activity because the merest

seconds ago, the last glue crumbled, the last bolt of life fell free, and the mummy-doll, the
erector-set grotesque disencumbered itself in smoke puffs and november leaflets, a broadcast
of mortality along the wind. mr. cooger, threshed in a final harvest, was now a billion parchment
flecks, tumbled sea-scrolls capered in meadows.a mere dust explosion in a silo of ancient
grain: gone.
â€˜oh, no. no, no,, no,, no,â€™ someone murmured.
charles halloway touched will's arm.
will stopped saying â€˜oh, no, no, no.â€™ he, too, in the last few moments, had thought the same
as his father, of the toted corpse, the strewn bone-meal, the mineral-enriched hills of grassâ€¦
now there was only the empty chair and the last particles of mica, the radiant motes of
peculiar dirt crusting the straps.and the freaks, who had been toting the baroque dump, now
fled to shadows.

boy -
â€˜jim! jim!â€™
jim awoke! circled half round, his face showed now july, now december. he seized the pole,
bleating out his despair. he wanted, he did not want. he wished, he rejected, he ardently
wished again, in flight, in heat-spell river of wind and blaze of metal, in jog of july and august
horses whose hoofs thudded the air like thrown fruit, his eyes blazed. tongue clamped in
teeth, he hissed his frustration.
â€˜jim! jump! dad, stop the machine!â€™
charles halloway turned to see where the control box stood, fifty feet off.
â€˜jim!â€™ will's side was stabbed with pain. â€˜i need you! come back!â€™
and, far over away on the far side of the carousel, traveling, fast-traveling, jim fought with
his own hands, the pole, the empty wind-whipped journey, the growing night, the wheeling
stars. he let go the pole. he grabbed it.and still his right hand trailed down and out, begging
will's last full ounce of strength.
â€˜jim!â€™
jim came around. there, below, in the

and dared to leap from so much promise, so many fine tall-growing years, flail out, off, down,
pull jim with.but jim could not let go the pole, could not give up the ride.
â€˜will!â€™
jim, half between machine and friend, one hand on each, screamed.
it was like a great tearing of cloth or flesh.
jim's eyes went blind as a statue's.
the carousel whirled.
jim screamed, fell, spun crazily, on the air.
will tried to break his fall, but jim struck earth rolling. he lay, silent.
charles halloway hit the carousel control switch.empty, the machine slowed. its horses
paced themselves down from their trot toward some far midsummer night.
together, charles halloway and his son knelt by jim to touch his wrist, to put ear to his
chest. jim's eyes, skinned white, were fixed on the stars.
â€˜oh. god,â€™ cried will. â€˜is he dead?â€™

â€˜deadâ€¦?â€™

â€˜help! he's after me!â€™ the boy cried. â€˜the terrible man! the terrible man! i want to go home!â€™
the boy flung himself forward, and grabbed at will's father.
â€˜oh, help, i'm lost, i don't like it. take me home. that man with the tattoos!â€™
â€˜mr. dark!â€™ gasped will.
â€˜yes!â€™ gibbered the boy. â€˜he's down that way! oh, stop him!â€™
â€˜will -â€™ his father rose - â€˜take care of jim.artificial respiration.all right, boy.â€™
the boy trotted off. â€˜this way!â€™
following, charles halloway watched the distraught boy who led him; observed his head, his
frame, the way his pelvis hung from his spine.
â€˜boy,â€™ he said, by the shadowed merry-go-round, twenty feet around from where will bent to
jim. â€˜what's your name?â€™
â€˜no time!â€™ cried the boy. â€˜jed. quick, quick!â€™
charles halloway stopped.
â€˜jed,â€™ he said. the boy no longer moved, but turned, chafing his elbows. â€˜how old are you,
jed?â€™
â€˜nine!â€™ said the boy. â€˜my gosh, this is no time! we -â€™

afraid of one man, jed. me.â€™
â€˜you?â€™ the boy still backed off. â€˜cut it out! why, why?â€™
â€˜because, sometimes good has weapons and evil none.sometimes tricks fail.sometimes

ge you got fixed and ready? to some side show, like the
mirrors? to someone like the witch? what, what, jed, what? let's just roll up your right shirt
sleeve, shall we, jed?â€™
the great moonstone eyes flashed at charles halloway.
the boy leaped back, but not before the man had leaped with him, seized his arm, grabbed
the back of his shirt and instead of simply rolling up the sleeve as first suggested, tore the
entire shirt off the boy's body.
â€˜why, yes, jed,â€™ said charles halloway, almost quietly. â€˜just as i thought.â€™
â€˜you, you, you, you!â€™
â€˜yes, jed, me.but especially you, look at you.â€™
and look he did.
for there, on the back of the small boy's hand, on the fingers, and up along the wrist
scrambled blue serpents, blue-venomed snake eyes, blue scorpions scuttling about blue shark
maws which gaped eternally hungry to feed upon all the freaks crammed and stung-sewn
cheek by jowl, skin to skin, flesh to flesh all up and down the chest, the tiny torso, and tucked

the secret gathering places on this small small very small body, this cold and now shocked and
trembling body.
â€˜why, jed, that's fine artwork, that is.â€™
â€˜you!â€™ the boy struck.
â€˜yes, still me.â€™ charles halloway took the blow in the face and clamped a vise, on the boy.
â€˜no!â€™
â€˜oh, yes,â€™ said charles halloway, using just his good right hand, his ruined left hand hanging
limp. â€˜yes, jed, jump, squirm, go ahead. it was a fine idea. get me off alone, fix me, then go back
and get will.and when the police come, why, you're just a boy nine or ten and the carnival, oh,
no, it's not yours, doesn't belong to you.stay here, jed. why you trying to get out from under

â€˜i'm not going to murder you, jed, mr. dark, whoever, whatever you are.you're going to
murder yourself because you can't stand being near people like me, not this close, close, not
this long.â€™
â€˜evil!â€™ groaned the boy, writhing. â€˜you're evil!â€™
â€˜evil?â€™ will's father laughed, which made the boy, wasp-stung and brambled by the sound,

he gathered the boy somewhat closer and thought,evil has only the power that we give it. i

the two matchstick lights in the boy's affrighted eyes blew out.
the boy, and his stricken and bruised conclave of monsters, his felt but half-seen crowd, fell
to earth.
there should have been a roar like a mountain slid to ruin.
but there was only a rustle, like a japanese paper lantern dropped in the dust.
53
charles halloway stood for a long while, breathing deep, lungs aching, looking down at the
body. the shadows swooned and fluttered in all the canvas alleys where odd assorted sizes of
freaks and people, fleshed in their own terrors and sins, held to poles, moaning in disbelief.
somewhere, the skeleton moved out in the light.somewhere else, the dwarf almost knew who
he was, and scuttled forth like a crab from a cave to blink and blink again at will bent working
over jim, at will's father bent to exhaustion over

ing as the small flesh cooled. there the
obscene wink of the navel eye gasped in on itself, there the nipple-iris of a trumpeting
mastodon went blind and raved at its blindness; each and every picture remembered from the
tall mr. dark now rendered down to miniature canvas pronged and forked over a boy's tennisracket
bones.
more freaks, with faces the color of beds where so many had lost the battle of souls,
emerged from the shadows to glide in a great and ever more curious carousel motion about
charles halloway and his dropped burden.
will paused in his desperate push and relaxation, push and relaxation, trying to shape jim
back to life, unafraid of the watchers in the dark, no time for that! even if there were time,
these freaks, he sensed, were breathing the night as if they had not been fed on such rare fine
air in years!
and as charles halloway watched, and the fox-fire, lobster-moist, phlegm-trapped eyes
watched from distances, the boy-who-had-been-mr.-dark grew yet colder, as death cut the

trying to outflee themselves.
so will turned back astride jim and pushed the chest and let go, pushed and let go, then,
trembling, touched his dear friend's cheek.
â€˜jimâ€¦?â€™
but jim was cold as spaded earth.
54
beneath the cold was a fugitive warmness, in the white skin lay some small color, but when
will felt jim's wrist there was nothing and when he put his ear to the chest there was nothing.
â€˜he's dead!â€™
charles halloway came to his son and his son's friend and knelt down to touch the quiet
throat, the unstirred rib cage.
â€˜no.â€™ puzzled. â€˜not quiteâ€¦â€™
â€˜dead!â€™
the tears burst from wills eyes.but then, as swiftly, be felt himself knocked, struck, shaken.
â€˜stop that!â€™ cried his father. â€˜you want to save him?!â€™
â€˜it's too late, oh, dad!â€™
â€˜shut up! listen!â€™
but will wept.
and again his father hauled off and hit him. once on the left cheek. once on the right cheek,
hard.

he seized will's hair, shook him.
â€˜nothingâ€¦ funnyâ€¦â€™
â€˜sure there is! me! you! jim! all of us! the whole shooting works! look!â€™
and charles halloway pulled faces, popped his eyes, mashed his nose, winked, cavorted like
chimpanzee-ape, waltzed with the wind, tap-danced the dust, threw back his head to bay at
the moon, dragging will with him.

the thought hit them all in the same quiet moment.
â€¦ finally you wind up owner of the carousel, keeper of the freaksâ€¦ proprietor for some small
part of eternity of the traveling dark carnival showsâ€¦

maybe, said their eyes, they're already here.
charles halloway stepped back into the machinery of the merry-go-round, found a wrench,
and knocked the flywheels and cogs to pieces. then he took the boys out and he hit the
control box one or two times until it broke and scattered fitful lightnings.
â€˜maybe this isn't necessary,â€™ said charles halloway. â€˜maybe it wouldn't run anyway, without
the freaks to give it power.but -â€™ he hit the box a last time and threw down the wrench.
â€˜it's late. must be midnight straight up.â€™
obediently, the city hall clock, the baptist church clock, the methodist, the episcopalian, the

them loping, and the last of this night's weeping done, and will laughing and singing and jim
giving answer line by line, as they breasted the waves of dry stubble toward a town where they
might live another few years across from each other.
and behind them jogged a middle-aged man with his own now solemn, now amiable,
thoughts.
perhaps the boys slowed. they never knew.perhaps charles halloway quickened his pace.
he could not say.
but,running even with the boys, the middle-aged man reached out.
will slapped, jim slapped, dad slapped the semaphore signal base at the same instant.
exultant, they banged a trio of shouts down the wind.
then, as the moon watched, the three of them together left the wilderness behind and
walked into the town.
