the miller was a stout carle for the nones,

that proved well, for *ov'r all where* he came,            *wheresoever*

with him there rode a gentle pardonere <55>
of ronceval, his friend and his compere,
that straight was comen from the court of rome.
full loud he sang, "come hither, love, to me"
this sompnour *bare to him a stiff burdoun*,             *sang the bass*

this pardoner had hair as yellow as wax,

notes to the pardoner's tale


1. the outline of this tale is to be found in the "cento novelle

of bath's tale, there is a long prologue, but in this case it has
been treated as part of the tale.

3. radix malorum est cupiditas: "the love of money is the root
of all evil" (1 tim.vi. 10)

note to the canon's yeoman's tale


1.  the tale of the canon's yeoman, like those of the wife of
bath and the pardoner, is made up of two parts; a long
general introduction, and the story proper. in the case of the
wife of bath, the interruptions of other pilgrims, and the
autobiographical nature of the discourse, recommend the
separation of the prologue from the tale proper; but in the
other cases the introductory or merely connecting matter
ceases wholly where the opening of "the tale" has been
marked in the text.

2. jupartie: jeopardy, hazard.  in froissart's french, "a jeu

him, to a vast whirling house of twigs, ever open to the arrival
of tidings, ever full of murmurings, whisperings, and clatterings,
coming from the vast crowds that fill it -- for every rumour,
every piece of news, every false report, appears there in the
shape of the person who utters it, or passes it on, down in earth.
out at the windows innumerable, the tidings pass to fame, who
gives to each report its name and duration; and in the house
travellers, pilgrims, pardoners, couriers, lovers, &c., make a
huge clamour. but here the poet meets with a man "of great
authority," and, half afraid, awakes; skilfully  -- whether by
intention, fatigue, or accident -- leaving the reader disappointed
by the nonfulfilment of what seemed to be promises of further
disclosures. the poem, not least in the passages the omission of
which has been dictated by the exigencies of the present
volume, is full of testimony to the vast acquaintance of chaucer
