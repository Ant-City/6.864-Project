Mercedes
Resigned to the blows that fate deals her, Mercedes acts
as a foil to her onetime fiance, Dantes. Though she is a good and
kind woman, her timidness and passivity lead her to betray her beloved
and marry another man, Mondego. Mercedes remains miserable for the
rest of her life, despising herself for her weakness and longing
for Dantes, whom she has never stopped loving. Yet, for all her
avowed weakness and fear, Mercedes proves herself capable of great
courage on three occasions: first, when she approaches Dantes to
beg for her the life of her son, Albert; second, when she reveals
her husband's wickedness in order to save Dantes's life; and third,
when she abandons her wealth, unwilling to live off a fortune that
has been tainted by misdeeds. At the end of the novel, Mercedes
is left with nothing to live for, aside from the hope that Albert
might somehow improve his own life. She is the character whose suffering
is the most complete, despite the fact that there are others who
bear far more guilt.
