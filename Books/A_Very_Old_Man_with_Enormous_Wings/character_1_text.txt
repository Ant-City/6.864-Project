on the third day of rain they had killed so many crabs inside the house that pelayo had to cross his drenched courtyard and throw them into the sea, because the newborn child had a temperature all night and they thought it was due to the stench. the world had been sad since tuesday. sea and sky were a single ash-gray thing and the sands of the beach, which on march nights glimmered like powdered light, had become a stew of mud and rotten shellfish. the light was so weak at noon that when pelayo was coming back to the house after throwing away the crabs, it was hard for him to see what it was that was moving and groaning in the rear of the courtyard. he had to go very close to see that it was an old man, a very old man, lying face down in the mud, who, in spite of his tremendous efforts, couldn’t get up, impeded by his enormous wings.

frightened by that nightmare, pelayo ran to get elisenda, his wife, who was putting compresses on the sick child, and he took her to the rear of the c

ourtyard. they both looked at the fallen body with a mute stupor. he was dressed like a ragpicker. there were only a few faded hairs left on his bald skull and very few teeth in his mouth, and his pitiful condition of a drenched great-grandfather took away any sense of grandeur he might have had. his huge buzzard wings, dirty and half-plucked, were forever entangled in the mud. they looked at him so long and so closely that pelayo and elisenda very soon overcame their surprise and in the end found him familiar. then they dared speak to him, and he answered in an incomprehensible dialect with a strong sailor’s voice. that was how they skipped over the inconvenience of the wings and quite intelligently concluded that he was a lonely castaway from some foreign ship wrecked by the storm. and yet, they called in a neighbor woman who knew everything about life and death to see him, and all she needed was one look to show the

m their mistake.

“he’s an angel,” she told them. “he must have been coming for the child, but the poor fellow is so old that the rain knocked him down.”

on the following day everyone knew that a flesh-and-blood angel was held captive in pelayo’s house. against the judgment of the wise neighbor woman, for whom angels in those times were the fugitive survivors of a celestial conspiracy, they did not have the heart to club him to death. pelayo watched over him all afternoon from the kitchen, armed with his bailiff’s club, and before going to bed he dragged him out of the mud and locked him up with the hens in the wire chicken coop. in the middle of the night, when the rain stopped, pelayo and elisenda were still killing crabs. a short time afterward the child woke up without a fever and with a desire to eat. then they felt magnanimous and decided to put the angel on a raft with fresh water and provisions for three days and leave hi

 were not those of an angel but, rather, those of a sidereal bat. the most unfortunate invalids on earth came in search of health: a poor woman who since childhood has been counting her heartbeats and had run out of numbers; a portuguese man who couldn’t sleep because the noise of the stars disturbed him; a sleepwalker who got up at night to undo the things he had done while awake; and many others with less serious ailments. in the midst of that shipwreck disorder that made the earth tremble, pelayo and elisenda were happy with fatigue, for in less than a week they had crammed their rooms with money and the line of pilgrims waiting their turn to enter still reached beyond the horizon.

the angel was the only one who took no part in his own act. he spent his time trying to get comfortable in his borrowed nest, befuddled by the hellish heat of the oil lamps and sacramental candles that had been placed along the wire. at first they tried to make him eat some mothballs, which, according to the

buted to the angel showed a certain mental disorder, like the blind man who didn’t recover his sight but grew three new teeth, or the paralytic who didn’t get to walk but almost won the lottery, and the leper whose sores sprouted sunflowers. those consolation miracles, which were more like mocking fun, had already ruined the angel’s reputation when the woman who had been changed into a spider finally crushed him completely. that was how father gonzaga was cured forever of his insomnia and pelayo’s courtyard went back to being as empty as during the time it had rained for three days and crabs walked through the bedrooms.

the owners of the house had no reason to lament. with the money they saved they built a two-story mansion with balconies and gardens and high netting so that crabs wouldn’t get in during the winter, and with iron bars on the windows so that angels wouldn’t get in. pelayo also set up a rabbit warren close to town and gave up his job as a bailiff for good, and elis

and yet he not only survived his worst winter, but seemed improved with the first sunny days. he re
