the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that
looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
there was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as
herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and
behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what
was on the top of it.

she stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the
mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar,
that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long
hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.




chapter v. advice from a caterpillar

the caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time in silence:
at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed
her in a languid, sleepy voice.

‘who are you?’ said the caterpillar.

this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. alice replied,
rather shyly, ‘i--i

 hardly know, sir, just at present--at least i know
who i was when i got up this morning, but i think i must have been
changed several times since then.’

‘what do you mean by that?’ said the caterpillar sternly. ‘explain
yourself!’

‘i can’t explain myself, i’m afraid, sir’ said alice, ‘because i’m not
myself, you see.’

‘i don’t see,’ said the caterpillar.

‘i’m afraid i can’t put it more clearly,’ alice replied very politely,
‘for i can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many
different sizes in a day is very confusing.’

‘it isn’t,’ said the caterpillar.

‘well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,’ said alice; ‘but when you
have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then
after that into a butterfly, i should think you’ll feel it a little
queer, won’t you?’

‘not a bit,’

 said the caterpillar.

‘well, perhaps your feelings may be different,’ said alice; ‘all i know
is, it would feel very queer to me.’

‘you!’ said the caterpillar contemptuously. ‘who are you?’

which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.
alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillar’s making such very
short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, ‘i think,
you ought to tell me who you are, first.’

‘why?’ said the caterpillar.

here was another puzzling question; and as alice could not think of any
good reason, and as the caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant
state of mind, she turned away.

‘come back!’ the caterpillar called after her. ‘i’ve something important
to say!’

this sounded promising, certainly: alice turned and came back again.

‘keep your temper,’ said the caterpillar.

‘is that all?’ said alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she
could.

‘no,’ said the caterpillar.

e thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and
perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. for some
minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its
arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, ‘so you think
you’re changed, do you?’

‘i’m afraid i am, sir,’ said alice; ‘i can’t remember things as i
used--and i don’t keep the same size for ten minutes together!’

‘can’t remember what things?’ said the caterpillar.

‘well, i’ve tried to say “how doth the little busy bee,” but it all came
different!’ alice replied in a very melancholy voice.

‘repeat, “you are old, father william,”’ said the caterpillar.

alice folded her hands, and began:--

   ‘you are old, father william,’ the young man said,
    ‘and your hair has become very white;
   and yet you incessantly stand on your head--
    do you think, at your age, it is right?’

   ‘in my youth,’ father william replied to his

jaw,
    has lasted the rest of my life.’

   ‘you are old,’ said the youth, ‘one would hardly suppose
    that your eye was as steady as ever;
   yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--
    what made you so awfully clever?’

   ‘i have answered three questions, and that is enough,’
    said his father; ‘don’t give yourself airs!
   do you think i can listen all day to such stuff?
    be off, or i’ll kick you down stairs!’


‘that is not said right,’ said the caterpillar.

‘not quite right, i’m afraid,’ said alice, timidly; ‘some of the words
have got altered.’

‘it is wrong from beginning to end,’ said the caterpillar decidedly, and
there was silence for some minutes.

the caterpillar was the first to speak.

‘what size do you want to be?’ it asked.

‘oh, i’m not particular as to size,’ alice hastily replied; ‘only one
doesn’t like changing so often, you know.’

‘i don’t know,’ said the caterpillar.

alice said nothing: she

had never been so much contradicted in her life
before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.

‘are you content now?’ said the caterpillar.

‘well, i should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn’t mind,’
said alice: ‘three inches is such a wretched height to be.’

‘it is a very good height indeed!’ said the caterpillar angrily, rearing
itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).

‘but i’m not used to it!’ pleaded poor alice in a piteous tone. and
she thought of herself, ‘i wish the creatures wouldn’t be so easily
offended!’

‘you’ll get used to it in time,’ said the caterpillar; and it put the
hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.

this time alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. in
a minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth

d yawned once or twice, and shook itself. then it got down off the
mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,
‘one side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you
grow shorter.’

‘one side of what? the other side of what?’ thought alice to herself.

‘of the mushroom,’ said the caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.

alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying
to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly
round, she found this a very difficult question. however, at last she
stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit
of the edge with each hand.

‘and now which is which?’ she said to herself, and nibbled a little of
the right-hand bit to try the e

t,’ said the gryphon in an impatient tone:
‘explanations take such a dreadful time.’

so alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first
saw the white rabbit. she was a little nervous about it just at first,
the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened
their eyes and mouths so very wide, but she gained courage as she went
on. her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about
her repeating ‘you are old, father william,’ to the caterpillar, and the
words all coming different, and then the mock turtle drew a long breath,
and said ‘that’s very curious.’

‘it’s all about as curious as it can be,’ said the gryphon.

‘it all came different!’ the mock turtle repeated thoughtfully. ‘i
should like to hear her try and repeat something now. tell her to
begin.’ he looked at the gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of
authority over alice.

‘stand up and repeat “‘tis the voice of the sluggard,”’ said the
