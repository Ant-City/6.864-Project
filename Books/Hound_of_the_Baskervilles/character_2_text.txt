    well that this is so, for it is obviously of the utmost
        importance that sir charlesâ€™s heir should settle at the
        hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly
        interrupted.  had the prosaic finding of the coroner not
        finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been
        whispered in connection with the affair, it might have been
        difficult to find a tenant for baskerville hall.  it is
        understood that the next of kin is mr. henry baskerville,
        if he be still alive, the son of sir charles baskervilleâ€™s
        younger brother.  the young man when last heard of was
        in america, and inquiries are being instituted with a
        view to informing him of his good fortune.â€

dr. mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket. â€œthose
are the public facts, mr. holmes, in connection with the death of sir
charles baskerville.â€

â€œi must thank you,â€ said sherlock holmes, â€œfor calling my attention to a

enough to tug a manâ€™s throat out, and
yet he was diabolical as well.â€

â€œi see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists. but now,
dr. mortimer, tell me this. if you hold these views, why have you come
to consult me at all? you tell me in the same breath that it is useless
to investigate sir charlesâ€™s death, and that you desire me to do it.â€

â€œi did not say that i desired you to do it.â€

â€œthen, how can i assist you?â€

â€œby advising me as to what i should do with sir henry baskerville, who
arrives at waterloo stationâ€--dr. mortimer looked at his watch--â€œin
exactly one hour and a quarter.â€

â€œhe being the heir?â€

â€œyes. on the death of sir charles we inquired for this young gentleman
and found that he had been farming in canada. from the accounts which
have reached us he is an excellent fellow in every way. i speak now not
as a medical man but as a trustee and executor of sir charlesâ€™s will.â€

â€œthere is no other claimant, i presume?â€

â€œi think it unlikely that he waited at the moor-gate every evening. on
the contrary, the evidence is that he avoided the moor. that night he
waited there. it was the night before he made his departure for london.
the thing takes shape, watson. it becomes coherent. might i ask you to
hand me my violin, and we will postpone all further thought upon this
business until we have had the advantage of meeting dr. mortimer and sir
henry baskerville in the morning.â€




chapter 4. sir henry baskerville



our breakfast table was cleared early, and holmes waited in his
dressing-gown for the promised interview. our clients were punctual to
their appointment, for the clock had just struck ten when dr. mortimer
was shown up, followed by the young baronet. the latter was a small,
alert, dark-eyed man about thirty years of age, very sturdily built,
with thick black eyebrows and a strong, pugnacious face. he wore a
ruddy-tinted tweed suit and had the weather-beaten appearance of one who
has spent mo

st of his time in the open air, and yet there was something
in his steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated
the gentleman.

â€œthis is sir henry baskerville,â€ said dr. mortimer.

â€œwhy, yes,â€ said he, â€œand the strange thing is, mr. sherlock holmes,
that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to you this morning
i should have come on my own account. i understand that you think out
little puzzles, and iâ€™ve had one this morning which wants more thinking
out than i am able to give it.â€

â€œpray take a seat, sir henry. do i understand you to say that you have
yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in london?â€

â€

œnothing of much importance, mr. holmes. only a joke, as like as not.
it was this letter, if you can call it a letter, which reached me this
morning.â€

he laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it. it was of
common quality, grayish in colour. the address, â€œsir henry baskerville,
northumberland hotel,â€ was printed in rough characters; the post-mark
â€œcharing cross,â€ and the date of posting the preceding evening.

â€œwho knew that you were going to the northumberland hotel?â€ asked
holmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor.

â€œno one could have known. we only decided after i met dr. mortimer.â€

â€œbut dr. mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?â€

â€œno, i had been staying with a friend,â€ said the doctor.

â€œthere was no possible indication that w

e intended to go to this hotel.â€

â€œhum! someone seems to be very deeply interested in your movements.â€ out
of the envelope he took a half-sheet of foolscap paper folded into four.
this he opened and spread flat upon the table. across the middle of it
a single sentence had been formed by the expedient of pasting printed
words upon it. it ran:

        as you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.

the word â€œmoorâ€ only was printed in ink.

â€œnow,â€ said sir henry baskerville, â€œperhaps you will tell me, mr.
holmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is that takes
so much interest in my affairs?â€

â€œwhat do you make of it, dr. mortimer? you must allow that there is
nothing supernatural about this, at any rate?â€

â€œno, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was convinced
that the business is supernatural.â€

â€œwhat business?â€ asked sir henry sharply. â€œit seems to me that all you
gentlemen know a great deal more than i do about

 encouraged by a
     protective tariff, but it stands to reason that such
     legislation must in the long run keep away wealth from the
     country, diminish the value of our imports, and lower the
     general conditions of life in this island.â€™

â€œwhat do you think of that, watson?â€ cried holmes in high glee, rubbing
his hands together with satisfaction. â€œdonâ€™t you think that is an
admirable sentiment?â€

dr. mortimer looked at holmes with an air of professional interest, and
sir henry baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark eyes upon me.

â€œi donâ€™t know much about the tariff and things of that kind,â€ said he,
â€œbut it seems to me weâ€™ve got a bit off the trail so far as that note is
concerned.â€

â€œon the contrary, i think we are particularly hot upon the trail, sir
henry. watson here knows more about my methods than you do, but i fear
that even he has not quite grasped the significance of this sentence.â€

â€œno, i confess that i see no connection.â€

â€œand yet, my dear w

 with decision, â€œit seems to me
that i have spoken quite enough about the little that i know. it is time
that you kept your promise and gave me a full account of what we are all
driving at.â€

â€œyour request is a very reasonable one,â€ holmes answered. â€œdr. mortimer,
i think you could not do better than to tell your story as you told it
to us.â€

thus encouraged, our scientific friend drew his papers from his pocket
and presented the whole case as he had done upon the morning before.
sir henry baskerville listened with the deepest attention and with an
occasional exclamation of surprise.

â€œwell, i seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance,â€ said
he when the long narrative was finished. â€œof course, iâ€™ve heard of the
hound ever since i was in the nursery. itâ€™s the pet story of the family,
though i never thought of taking it seriously before. but as to my
uncleâ€™s death--well, it all seems boiling up in my head, and i canâ€™t
get it clear yet. you donâ€™t seem quite to have

chapter 5. three broken threads



sherlock holmes had, in a very remarkable degree, the power of detaching
his mind at will. for two hours the strange business in which we had
been involved appeared to be forgotten, and he was entirely absorbed in
the pictures of the modern belgian masters. he would talk of nothing
but art, of which he had the crudest ideas, from our leaving the gallery
until we found ourselves at the northumberland hotel.

â€œsir henry baskerville is upstairs expecting you,â€ said the clerk. â€œhe
asked me to show you up at once when you came.â€

â€œhave you any objection to my looking at your register?â€ said holmes.

â€œnot in the least.â€

the book showed that two names had been added after that of baskerville.
one was theophilus johnson and family, of newcastle; the other mrs.
oldmore and maid, of high lodge, alton.

â€œsurely that must be the same johnson whom i used to know,â€ said holmes
to the porter. â€œa lawyer, is he not,

â€œhe is in charge of the hall.â€

â€œwe had best ascertain if he is really there, or if by any possibility
he might be in london.â€

â€œhow can you do that?â€

â€œgive me a telegraph form. â€˜is all ready for sir henry?â€™ that will
do. address to mr. barrymore, baskerville hall. what is the nearest
telegraph-office? grimpen. very good, we will send a second wire to the
postmaster, grimpen: â€˜telegram to mr. barrymore to be delivered into
his own hand. if absent, please return wire to sir henry baskerville,
northumberland hotel.â€™ that should let us know before evening whether
barrymore is at his post in devonshire or not.â€

â€œthatâ€™s so,â€ said baskerville. â€œby the way, dr. mortimer, who is this
barrymore, anyhow?â€

â€œhe is the son of the old caretaker, who is dead. they have looked after
the hall for four generations now. so far as i know, he and his wife are
as respectable a couple as any in the county.â€

â€œat the same time,â€ said baskerville, â€œitâ€™s clear enough that so lon

canâ€™t say that.â€

â€œnothing more that you can remember?â€

â€œno, sir; nothing.â€

â€œwell, then, here is your half-sovereign. thereâ€™s another one waiting
for you if you can bring any more information. good-night!â€

â€œgood-night, sir, and thank you!â€

john clayton departed chuckling, and holmes turned to me with a shrug of
his shoulders and a rueful smile.

â€œsnap goes our third thread, and we end where we began,â€ said he. â€œthe
cunning rascal! he knew our number, knew that sir henry baskerville had
consulted me, spotted who i was in regent street, conjectured that i had
got the number of the cab and would lay my hands on the driver, and so
sent back this audacious message. i tell you, watson, this time we have
got a foeman who is worthy of our steel. iâ€™ve been checkmated in london.
i can only wish you better luck in devonshire. but iâ€™m not easy in my
mind about it.â€

â€œabout what?â€

â€œabout sending you. itâ€™s an ugly business, watson, an ugly dangerous
business, and the mor

chapter 6. baskerville hall



sir henry baskerville and dr. mortimer were ready upon the appointed
day, and we started as arranged for devonshire. mr. sherlock holmes
drove with me to the station and gave me his last parting injunctions
and advice.

â€œi will not bias your mind by suggesting theories or suspicions,
watson,â€ said he; â€œi wish you simply to report facts in the fullest
possible manner to me, and you can leave me to do the theorizing.â€

â€œwhat sort of facts?â€ i asked.

â€œanything which may seem to have a bearing however ind

ighbours or any fresh particulars concerning the death of sir charles.
i have made some inquiries myself in the last few days, but the results
have, i fear, been negative. one thing only appears to be certain, and
that is that mr. james desmond, who is the next heir, is an elderly
gentleman of a very amiable disposition, so that this persecution does
not arise from him. i really think that we may eliminate him entirely
from our calculations. there remain the people who will actually
surround sir henry baskerville upon the moor.â€

â€œwould it not be well in the first place to get rid of this barrymore
couple?â€

â€œby no means. you could not make a greater mistake. if they are innocent
it would be a cruel injustice, and if they are guilty we should be
giving up all chance of bringing it home to them. no, no, we will
preserve them upon our list of suspects. then there is a groom at the
hall, if i remember right. there are two moorland farmers. there is our
friend dr. mortimer, whom i believe to be enti

de station and we all descended.
outside, beyond the low, white fence, a wagonette with a pair of cobs
was waiting. our coming was evidently a great event, for station-master
and porters clustered round us to carry out our luggage. it was a sweet,
simple country spot, but i was surprised to observe that by the gate
there stood two soldierly men in dark uniforms who leaned upon their
short rifles and glanced keenly at us as we passed. the coachman, a
hard-faced, gnarled little fellow, saluted sir henry baskerville, and in
a few minutes we were flying swiftly down the broad, white road. rolling
pasture lands curved upward on either side of us, and old gabled houses
peeped out from amid the thick green foliage, but behind the peaceful
and sunlit countryside there rose ever, dark against the evening sky,
the long, gloomy curve of the moor, broken by the jagged and sinister
hills.

the wagonette swung round into a side road, and we curved upward through
deep lanes worn by centuries of wheels, high banks on e

dial one.

â€œwell, jack, you are very hot.â€

â€œyes, i was chasing a cyclopides. he is very rare and seldom found in
the late autumn. what a pity that i should have missed him!â€ he spoke
unconcernedly, but his small light eyes glanced incessantly from the
girl to me.

â€œyou have introduced yourselves, i can see.â€

â€œyes. i was telling sir henry that it was rather late for him to see the
true beauties of the moor.â€

â€œwhy, who do you think this is?â€

â€œi imagine that it must be sir henry baskerville.â€

â€œno, no,â€ said i. â€œonly a humble commoner, but his friend. my name is
dr. watson.â€

a flush of vexation passed over her expressive face. â€œwe have been
talking at cross purposes,â€ said she.

â€œwhy, you had not very much time for talk,â€ her brother remarked with
the same questioning eyes.

â€œi talked as if dr. watson were a resident instead of being merely a
visitor,â€ said she. â€œit cannot much matter to him whether it is early
or late for the orchids. but you will come on

ways have been most unfruitful soil. i am no antiquarian, but i could
imagine that they were some unwarlike and harried race who were forced
to accept that which none other would occupy.

all this, however, is foreign to the mission on which you sent me and
will probably be very uninteresting to your severely practical mind.
i can still remember your complete indifference as to whether the sun
moved round the earth or the earth round the sun. let me, therefore,
return to the facts concerning sir henry baskerville.

if you have not had any report within the last few days it is because
up to today there was nothing of importance to relate. then a very
surprising circumstance occurred, which i shall tell you in due course.
but, first of all, i must keep you in touch with some of the other
factors in the situation.

one of these, concerning which i have said little, is the escaped
convict upon the moor. there is strong reason now to believe that he
has got right away, which is a considerable relief to the l

could not for the instant realize
that that moan had been the passing of his soul. not a whisper, not a
rustle, rose now from the dark figure over which we stooped. holmes laid
his hand upon him and held it up again with an exclamation of horror.
the gleam of the match which he struck shone upon his clotted fingers
and upon the ghastly pool which widened slowly from the crushed skull
of the victim. and it shone upon something else which turned our hearts
sick and faint within us--the body of sir henry baskerville!

there was no chance of either of us forgetting that peculiar ruddy tweed
suit--the very one which he had worn on the first morning that we had
seen him in baker street. we caught the one clear glimpse of it, and
then the match flickered and went out, even as the hope had gone out
of our souls. holmes groaned, and his face glimmered white through the
darkness.

â€œthe brute! the brute!â€ i cried with clenched hands. â€œoh holmes, i shall
never forgive myself for having left him to his fate.â€

, nor could i understand how we could both be absent at a
moment which he himself declared to be critical. there was nothing for
it, however, but implicit obedience; so we bade good-bye to our rueful
friend, and a couple of hours afterwards we were at the station of
coombe tracey and had dispatched the trap upon its return journey. a
small boy was waiting upon the platform.

â€œany orders, sir?â€

â€œyou will take this train to town, cartwright. the moment you arrive you
will send a wire to sir henry baskerville, in my name, to say that if he
finds the pocketbook which i have dropped he is to send it by registered
post to baker street.â€

â€œyes, sir.â€

â€œand ask at the station office if there is a message for me.â€

the boy returned with a telegram, which holmes handed to me. it ran:

wire received. coming down with unsigned warrant. arrive five-forty.
lestrade.

â€œthat is in answer to mine of this morning. he is the best of the
professionals, i think, and we may need his assistance. now, watson
