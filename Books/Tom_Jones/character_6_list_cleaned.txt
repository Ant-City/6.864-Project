[CHARACTER] 
 - 
                [CHARACTER] is the teacher whom allworthy accuses of being tom's father. he is a 
kind of comedic harlequin character (fielding even compares him to harlequin). 
although pathetic, bumbling, and cowardly, [CHARACTER] remains a loyal servant to 
jones and deserves his reward at the end of the novel. [CHARACTER] has a passion 
for speaking in latin non sequiturs. although [CHARACTER] creates problems for tom 
and sophia by boosting tom's reputation and defiling sophia's to all and sundry, 
tom cannot help forgiving [CHARACTER], who always has the best of intentions.
