you may see, lepidus, and henceforth know,
it is not caesar's natural vice to hate
our great competitor. from alexandria
this is the news:--he fishes, drinks, and wastes
the lamps of night in revel: is not more manlike
than cleopatra;, nor the queen of ptolemy
more womanly than he: hardly gave audience, or
vouchsaf'd to think he had partners: you shall find there
a man who is the abstract of all faults
that all men follow.

lepidus.
i must not think there are
evils enow to darken all his goodness:
his faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,
more fiery by night's blackness; hereditary
rather than purchas'd; what he cannot change
than what he chooses.

caesarion, whom they call my father's son,
and all the unlawful issue that their lust

my good knave eros, now thy captain is
even such a body: here i am antony;
yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.
i made these wars for egypt; and the queen,--
whose heart i thought i had, for she had mine;
which, whilst it was mine, had annex'd unto't
a million moe, now lost,--she, eros, has
pack'd cards with caesar, and false-play'd my glory
unto an enemy's triumph.--
nay, weep not, gentle eros; there is left us
ourselves to end ourselves.--

o, thy vile lady!
she has robb'd me of my sword.

no, antony;
my mistress lov'd thee, and her fortunes mingled
with thine entirely.

no more a soldier.--bruised pieces, go;
you have been nobly borne.--from me awhile.--

[exit eros.]

i will o'ertake thee, cleopatra, and
weep for my pardon. so it must be, for now
all length is torture.--since the torch is out,
lie down, and stray no further:--now all labour
mars what it does; yea, very force entangles
itself with strength: seal then, and all is done.--
eros!--i come, my queen.--eros!--stay for me:
where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,
and with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze:
dido and her aeneas shall want troops,
and all the haunt be ours.--come, eros, eros!

my desolation does begin to make
a better life. 'tis paltry to be caesar;
not being fortune, he's but fortune's knave,
a minister of her will: and it is great
to do that thing that ends all other deeds;
which shackles accidents and bolts up change;
which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,
the beggar's nurse and caesar's.
