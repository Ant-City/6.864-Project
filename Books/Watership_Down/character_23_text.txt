come and steal them if he can. you are to double the guards; and all the gardeners
and weeders are to be examined every day. not one leaf is to go out of the garden
until either i or my chief taster gives the order.'
     "the captain of the guard did as he was told. that night el-ahrairah came out
of the marshes of kelfazin and went secretly up to the great ditch. with him was
his trusty captain of owsla, rabscuttle. they squatted in the bushes and watched
the doubled guards patrolling up and down. when the morning came they saw all
the gardeners and weeders coming up to the wall and every one was looked at by
three guards. one was new and had come instead of his uncle who was ill, but the
guards would not let him in because they did not know him by sight and they
nearly threw him into the ditch before they would even let him go home. el-
ahrairah and rabscuttle came away in perplexity and that day, when p

rainbow came walking through the fields, he said, 'well, well, prince with the
thousand enemies, where are the lettuces?'
     "'i am having them delivered,' answered el-ahrairah. 'there will be rather too
many to carry.' then he and rabscuttle went secretly down one of their few holes
where there was no water, put a sentry outside and thought and talked for a day
and a night.
     "on the top of the hill near king darzin's palace there was a garden and here
his many children and his chief followers' children used to be taken to play by
their mothers and nursemaids. there was no wall round the garden. it was
guarded only when the children were there; at night it was empty, because there
was nothing to steal and no one to be hunted. th

e next night rabscuttle, who had
been told by el-ahrairah what he had to do, went to the garden and dug a scrape.
he hid in the scrape all night; and the next morning, when the children were
brought to play, he slipped out and joined them. there were so many children
that each one of the mothers and nursemaids thought that he must belong to
somebody else, but as he was about the same size as the children and not much
different to look at, he was able to make friends with some of them. rabscuttle
was full of tricks and games and quite soon he was running and playing just as if
he had been one of the children himself. when the time came for the children to

go home, rabscuttle went, too. they came up to the gate of the city and the
guards saw rabscuttle with king darzin's son. they stopped him and asked which
was his mother, but the king's son said, 'you let him alone. he's my friend,' and
rabscuttle went in with all the others.

ace, he scurried off and
went into one of the dark burrows; and here he hid all day. but in the evening he
came out and made his way to the royal storerooms, where the food was being got
ready for the king and his chief followers and wives. there were grasses and
fruits and roots and even nuts and berries, for king darzin's people went
everywhere in those days, through the woods and fields. there were no soldiers in
the storerooms and rabscuttle hid there in the dark. and he did all he could to
make the food bad, except what he ate himself.
     "that evening king darzin sent for the chief taster and asked him whether the
lettuces were ready. the chief taster said that several of them were excellent and
that he had already had some brought into the stores.
     "'good,' said the king. 'we will have two or three tonight.'
     "but the next morning the king and several of his people were taken ill with
bad stomachs. whatever they ate, t

hey kept on getting ill, because rabscuttle was
hiding in the storerooms and spoiling the food as fast as it was brought in. the
king ate several more lettuces, but he got no better. in fact, he got worse.
     "after five days rabscuttle slipped out again with the children and came back
to el-ahrairah. when he heard that the king was ill and that rabscuttle had done
all he wanted, el-ahrairah set to work to disguise himself. he clipped his white
tail and made rabscuttle nibble his fur short and stain it with mud and
blackberries. then he covered himself all over with trailing strands of goose grass
and big burdocks and he even found ways to alter his smell. at last even his own
wives could not recognize him, and el-ahrairah told rabscuttle to follow some
way behind and off he went to king darzin's palace. but rabscuttle waited
outside, on the top of the hill.
     "when he got to the palace, el-ahrairah demanded to see the captain of the
guard. 'you are to tak

is to put the matter for you in simple terms, insofar as i can. medically speaking,
there are certain complexities with which i will not weary you.'
     "'i cannot believe it,' said the king.
     "'the simplest course,' said el-ahrairah, 'will be to prove it to you. but we need
not make one of your subjects ill. tell the soldiers to go out and take a prisoner.'
     "the soldiers went out and the first creature they found was rabscuttle,
grazing on the hilltop. they dragged him through the gates and into the king's
presence.
     "'ah, a rabbit,' said el-ahrairah. 'nasty creature! so much the better.

     "rabscuttle did so and soon afterward he began to moan and thrash about. he
kicked in convulsions and rolled his eyes. he gnawed at the floor and frothed at
the mouth.

     "'there are a thousand lettuces in a pile at the top of the marsh. who put them
there?'
     "'i told you they were being delivered,' said el-ahrairah. 'you could hardly
expect my people, weak and hungry as they are, to carry them all the way from
king darzin's garden. however, they will soon recover now, under the treatment
that i shall prescribe. i am a physician, i may say, and if you have not heard as
much, prince rainbow, you may take it that you soon will, from another quarter.
rabscuttle, go out and collect the lettuces.'
     "then prince rainbow saw that el-ahrairah had been as good as his word, and
that he himself must keep his promise, too. he let the rabbits out of the marshes
of kelfazin and they multiplied everywhere. and from that day to this, no power
on earth can keep a rabbit out of a vegetable garden, for el-ahrairah prompts
them with a thousand tricks, the best in the world."

the story of the king's lettuce. that's what put me in mind of this tale, even
before hazel explained his idea. i used to hear it from my grandfather and he
always said that it happened after el-ahrairah had got his people out of the
marshes of kelfazin. they went to the meadows of fenlo and there they dug their
holes. but prince rainbow had his eye on el-ahrairah; and he was determined to
see that he didn't get up to any more of his tricks.
     "now one evening, when el-ahrairah and rabscuttle were sitting on a sunny
bank, prince rainbow came through the meadows and with him was a rabbit that
el-ahrairah had never seen before.
     "'good evening, el-ahrairah,' said prince rainbow. 'this is a great
improvement on the marshes of kelfazin. i see all your does are busy digging
holes along the bank. have they dug a hole for you?'
     "'yes,' said el-ahrairah. 'this hole here belongs to rabscuttle and myself. we
liked the look of this bank as soon as we saw it.'
     "'a very nice bank,'

 said prince rainbow. 'but i am afraid i have to tell you, el-
ahrairah, that i have strict orders from lord frith himself not to allow you to
share a hole with rabscuttle.'
     "'not share a hole with rabscuttle?' said el-ahrairah. 'why ever not?'
     "'el-ahrairah,' said prince rainbow, 'we know you and your tricks: and
rabscuttle is nearly as slippery as you are. both of you in one hole would be

altogether too much of a good thing. you would be stealing the clouds out of the
sky before the moon had changed twice. no -- rabscuttle must go and look after
the holes at the other end of the warren. let me introduce you. this is hufsa. i
want you to be his friend and look after him.'
     "'where does he come from?' asked el-ahrairah. 'i certainly haven't seen him
before.'
     "'he comes from another country,' said prince

rainbow, 'but he is no different
from any other rabbit. i hope you will help him to settle down here. and while he
is getting to know the place, i'm sure you will be glad to let him share your hole.'
     "el-ahrairah and rabscuttle felt desperately annoyed that they were not to be
allowed to live together in their hole. but it was one of el-ahrairah's rules never to
let anyone see when he was angry and, besides, he felt sorry for hufsa because he
supposed that he was feeling lonely and awkward, being far away from his own
people. so he welcomed him and promised to help him settle down. hufsa was
perfectly friendly and seemed anxious to please everyone; and rabscuttle moved
down to the other end of the warren.
     "after

and scratched a hole under the fence, he arrived the next morning to find it
blocked with wire, and he began to suspect that his plans were leaking out to
people who were not intended to learn them.
     "one day he determined to set a trap for hufsa, to find out whether it was he
who was at the bottom of the trouble. he showed him a path across the fields and
told him that it led to a lonely barn full of swedes and turnips: and he went on to
say that he and rabscuttle meant to go there the next morning. in fact el-
ahrairah had no such plans and took care not to say anything about the path or
the barn to anyone else. but next day, when he went cautiously along the path, he
found a wire set in the grass.
     "this made el-ahrairah really angry, for any of his people might have been
snared and killed. of course he did not suppose that hufsa was setting wires
himself, or even that he had known that a wire was going to be set. but evidently
hufsa was in touch w

     "'well, el-ahrairah,' said prince rainbow, interrupting him, 'i am sure i can
trust you. and to prove it, i have decided that i will grow a nice crop of carrots in
the field behind the hill. it is an excellent bit of ground and i am sure they will do
well. especially as no one would dream of stealing them. in fact, you can come
and watch me plant them, if you like.'
     "'i will,' said el-ahrairah. 'that will be delightful.'
     "el-ahrairah, rabscuttle, hufsa and several other rabbits accompanied prince
rainbow to the field behind the hill; and they helped him to sow it with long rows
of carrot seed. it was a light, dry sort of soil -- just the thing for carrots -- and the
whole business infuriated el-ahrairah, because he was certain that prince
rainbow was doing it to tease him and to show that he felt sure that he had
clipped his claws at last.
     "'that will do splendidly,' said prince rainbow when they had finished. 'of
course, i know t

t lord frith would take away his kingdom
and give it to someone else.'
     "el-ahrairah knew that prince rainbow meant that if he caught him stealing
the carrots he would either kill him or else banish him and put some other rabbit
over his people: and the thought that the other rabbit would probably be hufsa
made him grind his teeth. but he said, 'of course, of course. very right and
proper.' and prince rainbow went away.
     "one night, in the second moon after the planting, el-ahrairah and rabscuttle
went to look at the carrots. no one had thinned them out and the tops were thick
and green. el-ahrairah judged that most of the roots would be a little thinner than
a forepaw. and it was while he was looking at them in the moonlight that his plan
came to him. he had become so cautious about hufsa -- and indeed no one ever
knew where hufsa would be next -- that on the way back he and rabscuttle made
for a hole in a lonely bank and went down it to talk together. and there el-
ahrairah promised ra

bscuttle not only that he would steal prince rainbow's
carrots, but also that between them they would see the back of hufsa into the
bargain. they came out of the hole and rabscuttle went to the farm to steal some
seed corn. el-ahrairah spent the rest of the night gathering slugs; and a nasty
business it was.
     "the next evening el-ahrairah went out early and after a little while found
yona the hedgehog pottering along the hedge.
     "'yona,' he said, "would you like a whole lot of nice, fat slugs?'
     "'yes, i would, el-ahrairah,' said yona, 'but they're not so easily found. you'd

better and better. now you listen to me.'
     "meanwhile, in the wood, rabscuttle was talking to hawock the pheasant.
     "'hawock,' he said, 'can you swim?'
     "'i never go near water if i can avoid it, rabscuttle,' said hawock. 'i dislike it
very much. but i suppose if i had to, i could make shift to keep afloat for a little
while.'
     "'splendid,' said rabscuttle. 'now attend. i have a whole lot of corn -- and you
know how scarce it is at this time of year -- and you can have it all, if only you will
do a little swimming in the pond on the edge of the wood. just let

rther on they came to an old well by a big oak tree. the farmer had
filled it up long ago, but the mouth looked very deep and black in the moonlight.
     "'let's have a rest,' said el-ahrairah, 'just for a short time.'
     "as he spoke, a most curious-looking creature came out of the grass. it looked
something like a rabbit, but even in the moonlight they could see that it had a red
tail and long green ears. in its mouth it was carrying the end of one of the white
sticks that men burn. it was rabscuttle, but not even hufsa could recognize him.
he had found some sheep-dip powder at the farm and sat in it to make his tail
red. his ears were festooned with trails of bryony and the white stick was making
him feel ill.
     "'frith preserve us!' said el-ahrairah. 'what can it be? let's only hope it isn't
one of the thousand!' he leaped up, ready to run. 'who are you?' he asked,
trembling.
     "rabscuttle spat out the white stick.
     "'so!' he said commandingly. 'so you have seen me, el-ahrairah!

 you.'
     "'prince rainbow,' said el-ahrairah, 'for the third time, may i know for what i
am under arrest?'
     "'very well,' said prince rainbow, 'if this is the way you want to die, el-
ahrairah, you shall have the full process of law. you are under arrest for stealing
my carrots. are you seriously asking for a trial? i warn you that i have direct
evidence and it will go ill with you.'
     "by this time all el-ahrairah's people were crowding round, as near as they
dared for the dogs. only rabscuttle was nowhere to be seen. he had spent the
whole day moving the carrots to another secret hole and he was now hiding
because he could not get his tail white again.
     "'yes, i would like a trial,' said el-ahrairah, 'and i would like to be judged by a
jury of animals. for it is not right, prince rainbow, that you should both accuse
me and be the judge as well.'
     "'a jury of animals you shall have,' said prince rainbow. 'a jury of elil, el-
ahrairah. for a jury of rabbits would refuse to conv

have to be released.' they all agreed.
     "'you had better go quickly,' said prince rainbow to el-ahrairah. 'go down
your hole, el-ahrairah, before i hurt you myself.'
     "'i will, my lord,' said el-ahrairah. 'but may i beg you to remove that rabbit you
sent among us, for he troubles us with his foolishness?'
     "so hufsa went away with prince rainbow and el-ahrairah's people were left
in peace, apart from indigestion brought on by eating too many carrots. but it was
a long time before rabscuttle could get his tail white again, so my grandfather
always said."

ttuces. others say that yona the hedgehog went
gossiping in the copses. but, however it was, king darzin got to know that he had
been made a fool when he delivered his lettuces to the marshes of kelfazin. he
did not call his soldiers out to fight -- not yet. but he made up his mind that he
would find an opportunity to get his own back on el-ahrairah. el-ahrairah knew
this and he warned all his people to be careful, especially when they went about
alone.
     "now late one afternoon in february, rabscuttle led some of the rabbits out to
a rubbish heap on the edge of a garden, some way away from the warren. the
evening came on cold and misty, and well before twilight a fog came down thick.
they set off for home, but they got lost; and then they had trouble with an owl
and became confused over their direction. anyway, rabscuttle got separated from
the others, and after wandering about for some time, he strayed into the guards'
quarters outside king darzin's city; and they caught him and took him up

king.
     "king darzin saw his chance to spite el-ahrairah. he put rabscuttle into a
special prison hole and every day he was brought out and made to work,
sometimes in the frost, digging and tunneling. but el-ahrairah swore he would
get him out somehow. and so he did, for he and two of his does spent four days
digging a tunnel from the wood into the back of the bank where rabscuttle had
been set to work. and in the end this tunnel came near to the hole in the bank
down which rabscuttle had been sent. he was supposed to be digging to turn the
hole into a storeroom and the guards were watching outside while he worked. but
el-ahrairah reached him, for he could hear him scratching in the dark; and they
all slipped away down the tunnel and escaped through the wood.
     "when the news reached king darzin, he became very angry indeed, and he
determined that this time he would start a war and finish el-ahrairah once and
for all. his soldiers set out in the night and went to the mead

 to go near the black rabbit at all. the black rabbit might not accept
his life: yet still, perhaps, he might get a chance to try something else. only, there
could be no cheating the black rabbit. if his people's safety were to be had, by
whatever means, the price would be his life. so unless he failed, he would not
return. he would therefore need a companion to bring back whatever it was that
was going to overthrow king darzin and save the warren.
     "in the morning, el-ahrairah went to find rabscuttle and they talked far into
the day. then he called his owsla together and told them what he meant to do.

     "later that evening, in the last of the twilight, the rabbits came out and
attacked king darzin's soldiers. they fought very bravely and some of them were
killed. the enemy thought they were trying to break out of the warren and did
everything they could to surround them and force them back into their holes. but
the truth was that all the fighting was simply to distract king darzin's at

and keep his soldiers busy. as darkness set in, el-ahrairah and rabscuttle slipped
out from the other end of the warren and made off down the ditch, while the
owsla fell back and king darzin's soldiers jeered at them down the holes. as for
king darzin, he sent a message to say that he was ready to talk to el-ahrairah
about terms of surrender.
     "el-ahrairah and rabscuttle set out on their dark journey. what way they went
i don't know and no rabbit knows. but i always remember what old feverfew --
d'you remember him? -- used to say when he told this story. 'they didn't take
long,' he said. 'they took no time at all. no. they limped and stumbled through a
bad dream to that terrible place they were bound for. where they were traveling,
the sun and moon mean nothing and winter and summer less. but you will never

moss was slippery, and whenever they pushed out a pebble, it rattled down and
down behind them in the gullies. but el-ahrairah knew the way and on he went,
until the mist grew so thick that they could see nothing. then they kept close to
the cliff and little by little, as they went, it overhung them until it made a dark
roof above their backs. where the cliff ended was the mouth of a tunnel, like a
huge rabbit hole. in the freezing cold and silence, el-ahrairah stamped and
flashed his tail to rabscuttle. and then, as they were about to go into the tunnel,
they realized that what they had thought, in the gloom, to be a part of the rock
was not rock. it was the black rabbit of inlé, close beside them, still as lichen and
cold as the stone."
     "hazel," said pipkin, staring into the dusk and trembling, "i don't like this
story. i know i'm not brave--"

without sound or change, until at last el-ahrairah's spirit failed him and he knew
that he could not win.
     "'you can pay your stakes to the owsla, el-ahrairah,' said the black rabbit,
'and they will show you a burrow to sleep in. i shall return tomorrow and if you
are still here i will see you. but you are free to leave whenever you wish.'
     "then the owsla took el-ahrairah away and cut off his tail and pulled out his
whiskers; and when he came to himself, he was alone with rabscuttle in a hollow
stone burrow, with an opening to the mountain outside.
     "'oh, master,' said rabscuttle, 'what will you do now? for frith's sake let us go
away. i can feel for both of us in the dark.'
     "'certainly not,' said el-ahrairah. he still hoped to get what he wanted from
the black rabbit somehow and he felt sure that they had been put into this
burrow so that they would be tempted to steal away. 'certainly not. i can make do
very well with some willow herb and clematis. go out and ge

but make sure you come back before tomorrow evening. you had better try to
bring some food, too, if you can.'
     "rabscuttle went out as he was told and el-ahrairah was left alone. he slept
very little, partly for the pain and partly for the fear that never left him; but
chiefly because he was still searching for some trick that would serve his turn. the
next day rabscuttle returned with some pieces of turnip, and after el-ahrairah
had eaten them, rabscuttle helped him to patch himself up with a gray tail and
whiskers made from the winter drift of clematis and ragwort. in the evening he
went to meet the black rabbit as though nothing had happened.
     "'well, el-ahrairah,' said the black rabbit -- and he did not wrinkle his nose up
and down when he sniffed, but thrust it forward, as a dog does -- 'my burrow
cannot be what you are used to: but perhaps you have done your best to make
yourself comfortable?'
     "'i have, my lord,' said el-ahrairah.

s you would care to hear a story; and to tell one yourself,
if you like.'
     "'certainly, my lord,' said el-ahrairah. 'and if i can tell a story as good as
yours, perhaps you will accept my life and grant the safety of my people.'
     "'i will,' said the black rabbit. 'but if not, el-ahrairah, you will have to forfeit
your ears.' he waited to see whether el-ahrairah would refuse the wager but he
did not.
     "then the black rabbit told such a tale of fear and darkness as froze the hearts
of rabscuttle and el-ahrairah where they crouched on the rock, for they knew
that every word was true. their wits turned. they seemed to be plunged in icy
clouds that numbed their senses; and the black rabbit's story crept into their
hearts like a worm into a nut, leaving them shriveled and empty. when at last
that terrible story was ended, el-ahrairah tried to speak. but he could not collect
his thoughts and he stammered and ran about the floor, like a mouse when the

ed silently, with no sign of impatience. at
last it was clear that there would be no story from el-ahrairah, and the owsla
took him and put him into a deep sleep: and when he woke, his ears were gone
and only rabscuttle was beside him in the stone burrow, crying like a kitten.
     "'oh, master,' said rabscuttle, 'what good can this suffering bring? for the
sake of lord frith and the green grass, let me take you home.'
     "'nonsense,' said el-ahrairah. 'go out and get me two good, big dock leaves.
they will do very well for ears.'
     "'they will wither, master,' said rabscuttle, 'and i am withered now.'
     "'they will last long enough,' said el-ahrairah grimly, for what i have to do. but
i cannot find the way.'
     "when rabscuttle was gone, el-ahrairah forced himself to think clearly. the

and go away. but why not simply send him away? and why wait, before hurting
him, till he himself proposed a wager and lost it? the answer came to him
suddenly. these shadows had no power either to send him away or to hurt him,
except with his own consent. they would not help him, no. they would seek
possession of his will and break it if they could. but supposing that he could find
among them something that would save his people, could they stop him from
taking it away?
     "when rabscuttle came back, he helped el-ahrairah to diguise his horrible,
maimed head with two dock leaves in place of ears, and after a while they slept.
but el-ahrairah kept dreaming of his starving rabbits waiting in the runs to push
back king darzin's soldiers and placing all their hopes on him: and at last he
woke, cold and cramped, and wandered out into the runs of the stone warren. as
he limped along, trailing the dock leaves on either side of his head -- for he could

ft alone, wondering whether he would be able to reach king darzin's army
in time without the use of whiskers or ears.
     "at last, when he was sure that he must have stayed in the hole long enough to
be infected, el-ahrairah came out and began to make his way back along the run.
he did not know how soon the disease would appear or how long he would take
to die, but plainly he ought to return as quickly as he could -- if possible, before
there was any sign of illness on him. without going near rabscuttle, he must tell
him to hurry ahead, reach the rabbits in the warren and warn them to block all
the holes and stay inside until king darzin's army was destroyed.
     "he blundered into a stone in the dark, for he was shivering and feverish and
in any case he could feel little or nothing without his whiskers. at that moment a
quiet voice said, 'el-ahrairah, where are you going?' he had heard nothing, but he

holes of the warren, confusion and terror came upon them in the falling darkness.
the fields seemed full of huge rabbits with red eyes, stalking among the thistles.
they turned and fled. they vanished in the night; and that is why no rabbit who
tells the tales of el-ahrairah can say what kind of creatures they were or what they
looked like. not one of them has ever been seen, from that day to this.
     "when at last el-ahrairah was able to rise to his feet, the black rabbit was
gone and rabscuttle was coming down the run, looking for him. together they
went out to the mountainside and made their way down the stone-rattling gully
in the mist. they did not know where they were going, except that they were
going away from the black rabbit's warren. but after a time it became plain that
el-ahrairah was ill from shock and exhaustion. rabscuttle dug a scrape and there

they stayed for several days.

eir way back. they were confused in their wits and had to beg help and
shelter of other animals whom they met. their journey home lasted three
months, and many adventures they had. some these, as you know, are stories in
themselves. once they lived with a lendri and found pheasants' eggs for him in
the wood. and once they barely escaped from the middle of a hayfield when the
hay was cutting. all the time, rabscuttle looked after el-ahrairah, brought him
fresh dock leaves and kept the flies from his wounds until they healed.
     "at last, one day, they came back to the warren. it was evening, and as the sun
stretched out all the hills, they could see any number of rabbits at silflay, nibbling
in the grass and playing over the ant heaps. they stopped at the top of the field,
sniffing the gorse and herb robert on the wind.
     "'well, they look all right,' said el-ahrairah. 'a healthy lot, really. let's jus

in quietly and see whether we can find one or two of the owsla captains
underground. we don't want a lot of fuss.'
     "they made their way along the hedgerow, but could not altogether get their
bearings, because apparently the warren had grown bigger and there were more
holes than before, both in the bank and in the field. they stopped to speak to a
group of smart young bucks and does sitting under the elder bloom.
     "'we want to find loosestrife,' said rabscuttle. 'can you tell us where his
burrow is?'
     "'i never heard of him,' answered one of the bucks. 'are you sure he's in this
warren?'
     "'unless he's dead,' said rabscuttle. 'but surely you must have heard of captain
loosestrife? he was an officer of the owsla in the fighting.'
     "'what fighting?' asked another buck.
     "'the fighting against king darzin,' replied rabscuttle.
     "'here, do me a favor, old fellow, will you?' said the buck. 'that fighting -- i

     "'but surely you know the owsla captains who were?' said rabscuttle.
     "'i wouldn't be seen dead with them,' said the buck. 'what, that white-
whiskered old bunch? what do we want to know about them?'
     "'what they did,' said rabscuttle.
     "'that war lark, old fellow?' said the first buck. 'that's all finished now. that's
got nothing to do with us.'
     "'if this loosestrife fought king what's-his-name, that's his business,' said
one of the does. 'it's not our business, is it?'
     "'it was all a very wicked thing,' said another doe. 'shameful, really. if nobody
fought in wars, there wouldn't be any, would there? but you can't get old rabbits
to see that.'

     "'wisdom is found on the desolate hillside, el-ahrairah, where none comes to
feed, and the stony bank where the rabbit scratches a hole in vain. but, speaking
of gifts, i have brought a few trifles for you. a pair of ears, tail and some whiskers.
you may find the ears slightly strange at first. i put a little starlight in them, but it
is really quite faint: not enough, i am sure, to give away a clever thief like you. ah,
there is rabscuttle coming back. good, i have something for him, too. shall we--'"
     "hazel! hazel-rah!" it was pipkin's voice from behind a clump of burdock on
the edge of the little circle of listeners. "there's a fox coming up the combe!"

     *bob-stones is a traditional game of rabbits. it is played with small stones,
fragments of sticks or the like. fundamentally it is a very simple kind of
gambling, on the lines of "odds or evens." a "cast" of stones on the ground is

     "oh, what a pity!" said bluebell. "do you know, i'd quite decided to become a
water rabbit."
     "a what?" asked bigwig.
     "a water rabbit," repeated bluebell. "well, there are water rats and water
beetles and pipkin says that last night he saw a water hawk. so why not a water
rabbit? i shall float merrily along--"
     "great golden frith on a hill!" cried blackberry suddenly. "great jumping
rabscuttle! that's it! that's it! bluebell, you shall be a water rabbit!" he began
leaping and skipping about on the bank and cuffing fiver with his front paws.

woundwort doesn't know!"
     fiver paused. "yes, i do see," he replied at length. "you mean on the boat. i

     "off you go," said fiver, "and lay it on thick."

     "there was a big rabbit," said dandelion. "there was a small rabbit. there was
el-ahrairah; and he had the frost in his fine new whiskers. the earth up and down
the runs of the warren was so hard that you could cut your paws on it, and the
robins answered each other across the bare, still copses, 'this is my bit here. you
go and starve in your own.'
     "one evening, when frith was sinking huge and red in a green sky, el-ahrairah
and rabscuttle limped trembling through the frozen grass, picking a bite here and
there to carry them on for another long night underground. the grass was as
brittle and tasteless as hay, and although they were hungry, they had been
making the best of the miserable stuff so long that it was as much as they could
do to get it down. at last rabscuttle suggested that they might take a risk for once
in a way and slip across the fields to the edge of the village, where there was a big

vegetable garden.

owsby woof was reckoned to be a tremendous ratter and his master had
boasted about this skill of his so often and showed him off so much that he had
become revoltingly conceited. he believed himself to be the finest ratter in the
world. he ate a lot of raw meat (but not in the evening, because he was left
hungry at night to keep him active) and this made it rather easier to smell him
coming. but even so, he made the garden a dangerous place.
     "'well, let's chance rowsby woof for once,' said rabscuttle. 'i reckon you and i
ought to be able to give him the slip if we have to.'
     "el-ahrairah and rabscuttle made their way across the fields to the outskirts of
the garden. when they got there, the first thing they saw was the man himself,
with a white stick burning away in his mouth, cutting row after row of frosted
cabbages. rowsby woof was with him, wagging his tail and jumping about in a
ridiculous manner. after a time the man piled as many of the cabbages as he
could into a wheel thing and

 pushed them away to the house. he came back
several times and when he had taken all the cabbages to the door of the house he
began carrying them inside.
     "'what's he doing that for?' asked rabscuttle.
     "'i suppose he wants to get the frost out of them tonight,' replied el-ahrairah,
'before he takes them away in the hrududu tomorrow.'
     "'they'd be much better to eat with the frost out of them, wouldn't they?' said
rabscuttle. 'i wish we could get at them while they're in there. still, never mind.
now's our chance. let's see what we can do up this end of the garden while he's
busy down there.'
     "but hardly had they crossed the top of the garden and got among the cabbages
than rowsby woof had winded them and down he came, barking and yelping,
and they were lucky to get out in time.

     "'dirty little beasts,' shouted rowsby woof. 'how--how! how--how dare you
come snou--snou--snouting round here? get out -- out

! out -- out!'
     "'contemptible brute!' said el-ahrairah, as they scurried back to the warren
with nothing to show for all their trouble. 'he's really annoyed me. i don't know
yet how it's going to be done, but, by frith and inlé, before this frost thaws, we'll
eat his cabbages inside the house and make him look a fool into the bargain!'
     "'that's saying too much, master,' said rabscuttle. 'a pity to throw your life
away for a cabbage, after all we've done together.'
     "'well, i shall be watching my chance,' said el-ahrairah. 'i shall just be
watching my chance, that's all.'
     "the following afternoon rabscuttle was out, nosing along the top of the bank
beside the lane, when a hrududu came by. it had doors at the back and these
doors had somehow come open and were swinging about as the hrududu went
along. there were things inside wrapped up in bags like the ones men someti

leave about the fields; and as the hrududu passed rabscuttle, one of these bags
fell out into the lane. when the hrududu had gone rabscuttle, who hoped that the
bag might have something to eat inside, slipped down into the lane to have a sniff
at it. but he was disappointed to find that all it contained was some kind of meat.
later he told el-ahrairah about his disappointment.
     "'meat?' said el-ahrairah. 'is it still there?'
     "'how should i know?' said rabscuttle. 'beastly stuff.'
     "'come with me,' said el-ahrairah. 'quickly, too.'
     "when they got to the lane the meat was still there. el-ahrairah dragged the
bag into the ditch and they buried it.
     "'but what good will this be to us, master?' said rabscuttle.
     "'i don't know yet,' said el-ahrairah. 'but some good it will surely be, if the rats
don't get it. come home now, though. it's getting dark.'
     "as they were going home, they came on an old black wheel-covering thrown
away from a

 hrududu, lying in the ditch. if you've ever seen these things, you'll
know that they're something like a huge fungus -- smooth and very strong, but
pad-like and yielding too. they smell unpleasant, and are no good to eat.
     "'come on,' said el-ahrairah immediately. 'we have to gnaw off a good chunk
of this. i need it.'
     "rabscuttle wondered whether his master was going mad, but he did as he was
told. the stuff had grown fairly rotten and before long they were able to gnaw off
a lump about as big as a rabbits head. it tasted dreadful, but el-ahrairah carried it
carefully back to the warren. he spent a lot of time that night nibbling at it and
after morning silflay the next day he continued. about ni-frith he woke
rabscuttle, made him come outside and put the lump in front of him.
     "'what does that look like?' he said. 
 
 ___________________________
 
'never mind the smell. what does it look
like?'
     "rabscuttle looked at it. 'it looks rather like a dog's black nose, master,' he
answered, 'except that it's dry.'
     "'splendid,' said el-ahrairah, and went to sleep.
     "it was still frosty -- very clear and cold -- that night, with half a moon, but fu

rabscuttle to come with him. el-ahrairah carried the black nose himself and on

     "well, never mind," said hazel. "go on with the story."
     "in the end," continued dandelion, "rabscuttle kept well away from him, but
el-ahrairah held his breath and still carried the nose somehow, until they got to
the place where they had buried the meat.
     "'dig it up,' said el-ahrairah. 'come on.'
     "they dug it up and the paper ca

me off. the meat was all bits joined together
in a kind of trail like a spray of bryony, and poor rabscuttle was told to drag it
along to the bottom of the vegetable garden. it was hard work and he was glad
when he was able to drop it.
     "'now,' said el-ahrairah, 'we'll go round to the front.'
     "when they got to the front, they could tell that the man had gone out. for one
thing, the house was all dark but, besides, they could smell that he had been
through the gate a little while before. the front of the house had a flower garden
and this was separated from the back and the vegetable garden by

 a high, close-
boarded fence that ran right across and ended in a big clump of laurels. just the
other side of the fence was the back door that led into the kitchen.
     "el-ahrairah and rabscuttle went quietly through the front garden and peeped
through a crack in the fence. rowsby woof was sitting on the gravel path, wide
awake and shivering in the cold. he was so near that they could see his eyes blink
in the moonlight. the kitchen door was shut, but nearby, along the wall, there
was a hole above the drain where a brick had been left out. the kitchen floor was
made of bricks and the man used to wash it with a rough broom and sweep the
water out through the hole. the hole was plugged up

     "'ah, well,' said el-ahrairah, 'never mind. i will depart. in the next village there
lives a dog--'
     "'no, no,' cried rowsby woof. 'no, fairy wogdog, do not leave me! i trust you!
i will go at once! only guard the house and do not fail me!'
     "'have no fear, noble hound,' said el-ahrairah. 'only trust the word of the great
queen.'
     "rowsby woof went bounding away in the moonlight and el-ahrairah watched
him out of sight.
     "'are we to go into the house now, master?' asked rabscuttle. 'we shall have to
be quick.'
     "'certainly not,' said el-ahrairah. 'how could you suggest such double-dealing?
for shame, rabscuttle! we will guard the house.'
     "they waited silently and after a while rowsby woof returned, licking his lips
and grinning. he came sniffing up to the fence.
     "'i perceive, honest friend,' said el-ahrairah, 'that you found the meat as swiftly
as though it had been a rat. the house is safe and all is well. now hark. i shall
return to the queen and tell her

rairah. 'now, o fortunate dog, go to the crossroads and
await the queen. she is coming on the wings of night. it is far that she must come,
but wait patiently. only wait. do not fail her and great blessing will be yours,'
     "'fail her? no, no!' cried rowsby woof. 'i will wait like a worm upon the road.
her beggar am i, fairy wogdog! her mendicant, her idiot, her--'
     "'quite right, most excellent,' said el-ahrairah. 'only make haste.'
     "as soon as rowsby woof had gone, el-ahrairah and rabscuttle went quickly
through the laurels, round the end of the fence and along to the back door. el-
ahrairah pulled the cloth out of the hole above the drain with his teeth and led the
way into the kitchen.
     "the kitchen was as warm as this bank and at one end was a great pile of
vegetables ready for the hrududu in the morning -- cabbages, brussels sprouts
and parsnips. they were thawed out and the delicious smell was quite
overpowering. el-ahrairah and rabscuttle began at once to make amends for

the
past days of frozen grass and tree bark.
     "'good, faithful fellow,' said el-ahrairah with his mouth full. 'how grateful he
will be to the queen for keeping him waiting. he will be able to show her the full
extent of his loyalty, won't he? have another parsnip, rabscuttle.'
     "meanwhile, down at the crossroads, rowsby woof waited eagerly in the frost,
listening for the coming of queen dripslobber. after a long time he heard
footsteps. they were not the steps of a dog but of a man. as they came near, he
realized that they were the steps of his own master. he was too stupid to run away
or hide, but merely remained where he was until his master -- who was returning
home -- came up to the crossroads.
     "'why, rowsby woof,' said his master, 'what are you doing

ed foolish and nosed about. his master was puzzled. then
a thought came to him.
     "'why, good old chap,' he said, 'you came to meet me, did you? good fellow,
then! come on, we'll go home together.'
     "rowsby woof tried to slip away, but his master grabbed him by the collar, tied
him by a bit of string he had in his pocket and led him home.
     "their arrival took el-ahrairah by surprise. it fact, he was so busy stuffing

cabbage that he heard nothing until the doorhandle rattled. he and rabscuttle
had only just time to slip behind a pile of baskets before the man came in, leading
rowsby woof. rowsby woof was quiet and dejected and did not even notice the
smell of rabbit, which anyway was all mixed up with the smell of the fire and the
larder. he lay on the mat while the man made some sort of drink for himself.
     "el-ahrairah was watching his chance to dash out of the hole in the wall. but
the man, as he sat drinking and puffing away at a white stick, suddenly looked
round and got up. 
 
 ___________________________
 
 and went away to sleep,
leaving rowsby woof shut in the kitchen. evidently he thought it too cold to turn
him out for the night.
     "at first rowsby woof whined and scratched at the door, but after a time he
came back to the mat by the fire and lay down. el-ahrairah moved very quietly
along the wall until he was behind a big metal box in the corner under the sink.
there were sacks and old papers here, too, and he felt fairly sure that rowsby
woof could not manage to see behind it. as soon as rabscuttle had joined him, he
spoke.
     "'o rowsby woof!' whispered el-ahrairah.
     "rowsby woof was up in a flash.
     "'fairy wogdog!' he cried. 'is that you i hear?'
     "'it is indeed,' said el-ahrairah. 'i am sorry for your disappointment, rowsby
woof. you did not meet the queen.'
     "'alas, no,' said rowsby woof: and he told what had happened at the
crossroads.
     "'never mind,' said el-ahrairah. do not be downhearted, rowsby woof. there
was good reason why the queen did not come. she rece

e flung open the window and listened for thieves, but he could
hear nothing, partly because there was nothing to hear and partly because of the
ceaseless barking. at last he picked up his gun, flung open the door and went
cautiously out to see what was the matter. out shot rowsby woof, bellowing like
a bull, and tore around the house. the man followed him at a run, leaving the
door wide.
     "'quick!' said el-ahrairah. 'quicker than wogdog from the tartar's bow! come
on!'
     "el-ahrairah and rabscuttle dashed into the garden and disappeared through
the laurels. in the field beyond they paused for a moment. from behind came the
sounds of yelping and woofing, mixed with shouts and angry cries of 'come 'ere,
damn you!'
     "'noble fellow,' said el-ahrairah. 'he has saved his master, rabscuttle. he has
saved us all. let us go home and sleep sound in our burrow.'
     "for the rest of his life rowsby woof never forgot the night when he had

spell. they wore shining collars round their necks and sang like the birds and

some of them could fly. but for all they looked so fine, their hearts were dark and
tharn. so then el-ahrairah's people said, 'ah, see, these are the wonderful rabbits
of prince rainbow. they are like princes themselves. we will live with them and
become princes, too.'"
     vilthuril looked up and saw the newcomers. she paused for a moment and
then went on.
     "but frith came to rabscuttle in a dream and warned him that that warren was
enchanted. and he dug into the ground to find where the spell was buried. deep
he dug, and hard was the search, but at last he found that wicked spell and
dragged it out. so they all fled from it, but it turned into a great rat and flew at el-
ahrairah. then el-ahrairah fought the rat, up and down, and at last he held it,
pinned under his claws, and it turned into a great white bird which spoke to him
and blessed him."
