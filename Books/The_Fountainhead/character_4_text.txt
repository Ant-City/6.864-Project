i offer my profound gratitude to the great profession of architecture and its heroes who have 
given us some of the highest expressions of man's genius, yet have remained unknown, 
undiscovered by the majority of men. and to the architects who gave me their generous 
assistance in the technical matters of this book.

howard roark laughed.

he stood naked at the edge of a cliff. the lake lay far below him. a frozen explosion of granite 
burst in flight to the sky over motionless water. the water seemed immovable, the stone--
flowing. the stone had the stillness of one brief moment in battle when thrust meets thrust 
and the currents are held in a pause more dynamic than motion. the stone glowed, wet with 
sunrays.

the lake below was only a thin steel ring that cut the rocks in half. the rocks went on i

e pineapples particularly, thought guy francon, had stood the test of years very well. it is, 
thought guy francon, touching; it was i who built this annex and this very hall, twenty years 
ago; and here i am.

the hall was packed with bodies and faces, so tightly that one could not distinguish at a 
glance which faces belonged to which bodies. it was like a soft, shivering aspic made of 
mixed arms, shoulders, chests and stomachs. one of the heads, pale, dark haired and 
beautiful, belonged to peter keating.

he sat, well in front, trying to keep his eyes on the platform, because he knew that many 
people were looking at him and would look at him later. he did not glance back, but the 
consciousness of those centered glances never left him. his eyes were dark, alert, intelligent. 
his mouth, a small upturned crescent faultlessly traced, was gentle and generous, and warm 
with the faint promise of a smile. his head had a certain classical perfection in the shape of 
the skull, in the natural wave o

f black ringlets about finely hollowed temples. he held his head 
in the manner of one who takes his beauty for granted, but knows that others do not. he was 
peter keating, star student of stanton, president of the student body, captain of the track 
team, member of the most important fraternity, voted the most popular man on the campus.

the crowd was there, thought peter keating, to see him graduate, and he tried to estimate the 
capacity of the hall. they knew of his scholastic record and no one would beat his record 
today. oh, well, there was shlinker. shlinker had given him stiff competition, but he had 
beaten shlinker this last year. he had worked like a dog, because he had wanted to beat 
shlinker. he had no rivals today....then he felt suddenly as if something had fallen down, 
inside his throat, to his stomach, something cold and empty, a blank hole rolling do

w face and gold-rimmed glasses. he stared at shlinker warmly, in relief, in 
reassurance, in gratitude. it was obvious that shlinker could never hope to equal his own 
appearance or ability; he had nothing to doubt; he would always beat shlinker and all the 
shlinkers of the world; he would let no one achieve what he could not achieve. let them all 
watch him. he would give them good reason to stare. he felt the hot breaths about him and 
the expectation, like a tonic. it was wonderful, thought peter keating, to be alive.

his head was beginning to reel a little. it was a pleasant feeling. the feeling carried him, 
unresisting and unremembering, to the platform in front of all those faces. he stood--slender, 
trim, athletic--and let the deluge break upon his head. he gathered from its roar that he had 
graduated with honors, that the architects' guild of america had presented him with a gold 
medal and that he had been awarded the prix de paris by the society for architectural

was two years younger and one class below him. if he had ever 
entertained any doubts on their respective gifts, hadn't this day settled it all? and, he 
remembered, roark had been very nice to him, helping him whenever he was stuck on a 
problem...not stuck, really, just did not have the time to think it out, a plan or something. 
christ! how roark could untangle a plan, like pulling a string and it was open...well, what if he 
could? what did it get him? he was done for now. and knowing this, peter keating 
experienced at last a satisfying pang of sympathy for howard roark.

when keating was called upon to speak, he rose confidently. he could not show that he was 
terrified. he had nothing to say about architecture. but he spoke, his head high, as an equal 
among equals, just subtly diffident, so that no great name present could take offense. he 
remembered saying: "architecture is a great art...with our eyes to the future and the reverence 
of the past in our hearts...of all the crafts, the most

those old 
fogies." and now keating was on his way home through the soft darkness, wondering how to 
get away from his mother for the night.

his mother, he thought, had done a great deal for him. as she pointed out frequently, she was 
a lady and had graduated from high school; yet she had worked hard, had taken boarders into 
their home, a concession unprecedented in her family.

his father had owned a stationery store in stanton. changing times had ended the business 
and a hernia had ended peter keating, sr., twelve years ago. louisa keating had been left 
with the home that stood at the end of a respectable street, an annuity from an insurance kept 
up accurately--she had seen to that--and her son. the annuity was a modest one, but with the 
help of the boarders and of a tenacious purpose mrs. keating had managed. in the summers 
her son helped, clerking in hotels or posing for hat advertisements. her son, mrs. keating had 
decided, would assume his rightful place in the world, and she had cl

t keating raced toward boston, wedged in between two boys, the wind and the road 
whistling past him. and he thought that the world was opening to him now, like the darkness 
fleeing before the bobbing headlights. he was free. he was ready. in a few years--so very 
soon, for time did not exist in the speed of that car--his name would ring like a horn, ripping 
people out of sleep. he was ready to do great things, magnificent things, things unsurpassed 
in...in...oh, hell...in architecture.

peter keating looked at the streets of new york. the people, he observed, were 
extremely well dressed.

he had stopped for a moment before the building on fifth avenue, where the office of 
francon & heyer and his first day of work awaited him. he looked at the men who hurried 
past. smart, he thought, smart as hell. he glanced regretfully at his own clothes. he had a 
great deal to learn in new york.

when he could delay it no longer, he turned to the door. it was a miniature doric portico, every 
inch of

ss the sheet. he followed the 
lines, not knowing where they led or why. he knew only that the plan was someone's 
tremendous achievement which he could neither question nor equal. he wondered why he 
had ever thought of himself as a potential architect.

much later, he noticed the wrinkles of a gray smock sticking to a pair of shoulder blades over 
the next table. he glanced about him, cautiously at first, then with curiosity, then with pleasure, 
then with contempt. when he reached this last, peter keating became himself again and felt 
love for mankind. he noticed sallow cheeks, a funny nose, a wart on a receding chin, a 
stomach squashed against the edge of a table. he loved these sights. what these could do, 
he could do better. he smiled. peter keating needed his fellow men.

when he glanced at his plans again, he noticed the flaws glaring at him from the masterpiece. 
it was the floor of a private residence, and he noted the twisted hallways that sliced great 
hunks of space for no apparent

g eyes and a manner of frightened sweetness 
toward everyone. he was the relic of an ancient family, and it was suspected mat francon had 
taken him into partnership for the sake of his social connections. people felt sorry for poor 
dear lucius, admired him for the effort of undertaking a professional career, and thought it 
would be nice to let him build their homes. francon built them and required no further service 
from lucius. this satisfied everybody.

the men in the drafting rooms loved peter keating. he made them feel as if he had been 
there for a long time; he had always known how to become part of any place he entered; he 
came soft and bright as a sponge to be filled, unresisting, with the air and the mood of the 
place. his warm smile, his gay voice, the easy shrug of his shoulders seemed to say that 
nothing weighed too much within his soul and so he was not one to blame, to demand, to 
accuse anything.

as he sat now, watching francon read the article, francon raised his head to gl

r "it's tim davis again, mr. francon, do forgive him, he 
can't help it, he hasn't got his mind on his work at all!"

when francon glanced at the list of his employees' salaries, he noticed that his most 
expensive draftsman was the man least needed in the office.

when tim davis lost his job, no one in the drafting room was surprised but tim davis. he 
could not understand it. he set his lips defiantly in bitterness against a world he would hate 
forever. he felt he had no friend on earth save peter keating.

keating consoled him, cursed francon, cursed the injustice of humanity, spent six dollars in a 
speak-easy, entertaining the secretary of an obscure architect of his acquaintance and 
arranged a new job for tim davis.

whenever he thought of davis afterward, keating felt a warm pleasure; he had influenced the 
course of a human being, had thrown him off one path and pushed him into another; a human 
being--it was not tim davis to him any longer, it was a living frame and a mind, a conscious

mind--why had he always feared that mysterious entity of consciousness within others?--and 
he had twisted that frame and that mind to his own will. by a unanimous decision of francon, 
heyer and the chief draftsman, tim's table, position and salary were given to peter keating. 
but this was only part of his satisfaction; there was another sense of it, warmer and less real--
and more dangerous. he said brightly and often: 'tim davis? oh yes, i got him his present 
job."

he wrote to his mother about it. she said to her friends: "petey is such an unselfish boy."

he wrote to her dutifully each week; his letters were short and respectful; hers, long, detailed 
and full of advice which he seldom finished reading.

he saw catherine halsey occasionally. he had not gone to

 a time, and 
roark had not found him at home, and had known what was happening, but could only wait, 
hoping for cameron's safe return. then, cameron had lost even the shame of his agony, and 
had come to his office reeling, recognizing no one, openly drunk and flaunting it before the 
walls of the only place on earth he had respected.

roark learned to face his own landlord with the quiet statement that he could not pay him for 
another week; the landlord was afraid of him and did not insist. peter keating heard of it 
somehow, as he always heard everything he wanted to know. he came to roark's unheated 
room, one evening, and sat down, keeping his overcoat on. he produced a wallet, pulled out 
five ten-dollar bills, and handed them to roark. "you need it, howard. i know you need it. 
don't start protesting now. you can pay me back any time." roark looked at him, astonished, 
took the money, saying: "yes, i need it. thank you, peter." then keating said: "what in hell 
are you doing, wasting yours

reer, but a crusade and a consecration to a joy that justifies the existence of the 
earth." he dropped the clipping into the fire and reached for another folder.

he gathered every stub of pencil from cameron's desk and threw them in also.

he stood over the heater. he did not move, he did not look down; he felt the movement of the 

glow, a faint shudder at the edge of his vision. he looked at the drawing of the skyscraper that 
had never been built, hanging on the wall before him.

it was peter keating's third year with the firm of francon & heyer. he carried his head high, 
his body erect with studied uprightness; he looked like the picture of a successful young man 
in advertisements for high-priced razors or medium-priced cars.

he dressed well and watched people noticing it. he had an apartment off park avenue, 
modest but fashionable, and he bought three valuable etchings as well as a first edition of a 
classic he had never read nor opened since. occasionally, he escorted clients to the

 hand, palm up, and looked at it: she wore a black woolen glove and her 
fingers were spread out clumsily like a child's; he saw beads of melted snow in the fuzz of the 
glove; they sparkled radiantly once in the light of a car flashing past.

the bulletin of the architects' guild of america carried, in its miscellaneous department, a 
short item announcing henry cameron's retirement. six lines summarized his achievements 
in architecture and misspelled the names of his two best buildings.

peter keating walked into francon's office and interrupted francon's well-bred bargaining with 
an antique dealer over a snuffbox that had belonged to madame pompadour. francon was 
precipitated into paying nine dollars and twenty-five cents more than he had intended to pay. 
he turned to keating testily, after the dealer had left, and asked:

"well, what is it, peter, what is it?"

keating threw the bulletin down on francon's desk, his thumbnail underscoring the paragraph 
about cameron.

"i've got to have

ach other silently, and that was the final seal on their friendship.

weeks later, mike stopped roark, one day, at the building, his ugly face puzzled, and asked:

"say, red, i heard the super tell a guy from the contractor's that you're stuck-up and stubborn 
and the lousiest bastard he's ever been up against. what did you do to him?"

"nothing."

"what the hell did he mean?"

"i don't know," said roark. "do you?"

mike looked at him, shrugged and grinned.

"no," said mike.

early in may, peter keating departed for washington, to supervise the construction of a 
museum donated to the city by a great philanthropist easing his conscience. the museum 
building, keating pointed out proudly, was to be decidedly different: it was not a reproduction 
of the parthenon, but of the maison carrée at nîmes.

keating had been away for some time when an office boy approached roark's table and 
informed him that mr. francon wished to see him in his office. when roark entered the 
sanctuary, francon smiled

s of bronze lace. the strike had 
shattered the future possibilities; francon could not be blamed for it, but one could never tell 
whom gail wynand would blame and for what reason. the unpredictable, unaccountable 
shifts of wynand's favor were famous, and it was well known that few architects he employed 
once were ever employed by him again.

francon's sullen mood led him to the unprecedented breach of snapping over nothing in 
particular at the one person who had always been immune from it--peter keating. keating 
shrugged, and turned his back to him in silent insolence. then keating wandered aimlessly 
through the halls, snarling at young draftsmen without provocation. he bumped into lucius n. 
heyer in a doorway and snapped: "look where you're going!" heyer stared after him, 
bewildered, blinking.

there was little to do in the office, nothing to say and everyone to avoid. keating left early and 
walked home through a cold december twilight.

at home, he cursed aloud the thick smell of paint

and keating found himself spending days and nights at work, with new commissions 
pouring into the office. francon smiled happily at everybody and gave a small party for his 
staff, to erase the memory of anything he might have said. the palatial residence of mr. and 
mrs. dale ainsworth on riverside drive, a pet project of keating's, done in late renaissance 
and gray granite, was complete at last. mr. and mrs. dale ainsworth gave a formal reception 
as a housewarming, to which guy francon and peter keating were invited, but lucius n. 
heyer was ignored, quite accidentally, as always happened to him of late. francon enjoyed 
the reception, because every square foot of granite in the house reminded him of the 
stupendous payment received by a certain granite quarry in connecticut. keating enjoyed the 
reception, because the stately mrs. ainsworth said to him with a disarming smile: "but i was 
certain that you were mr. francon's partner! it's francon and heyer, of course! how perfectly 
careless of

ce it; he enjoyed having francon in a trap.

"and the plan! the plan! do you see that on the second floor...oh," said francon, noticing.

he looked at keating, then at the library, then at keating again.

"well," said francon at last, "don't blame me afterward. you've asked for it. come on."

they entered the library together. keating stopped, correctly, but allowing his eyes an 
improper intensity, while francon beamed with unconvincing cheeriness:

"dominique, my dear! may i present?--this is peter keating, my own right hand. peter--my 
daughter."

"how do you do," said keating, his voice soft.

dominique bowed gravely.

"i have waited to meet you for such a long time, miss francon."

"this will be interesting," said dominique. "you will want to be nice to me, of course, and yet 
that won't be diplomatic."

"what do you mean, miss francon?"

"father would prefer you to be horrible with me. father and i don't get along at all."

"why, miss francon, i..."

"i think it's only fair to tell you this a

" said dominique.

"what?"

"seventh time that you've said it when meeting me, gordon. i'm counting them."

"you simply won't be serious, dominique. you'll never be serious."

"oh, yes, gordon. i was just having a very serious conversation here with my friend peter 
keating."

a lady waved to prescott and he accepted the opportunity, escaping, looking very foolish. and 
keating delighted in the thought that she had dismissed another man for a conversation she 
wished to continue with her friend peter keating.

but when he turned to her, she asked sweetly: "what was it we were talking about, mr. 
keating?" and then she was staring with too great an interest across the room, at the wizened 
figure of a little man coughing over a whisky glass. "why," said keating, "we were..."

"oh, there's eugene pettingill. my great favorite. i must say hello to eugene."

and she was up, moving across the room, her body leaning back as she walked, moving 
toward the most unattractive septuagenarian present.

i don't expect it, mr. snyte."

"don't expect anyone else in the profession to take you in, after they hear what you've done to 
me."

"i don't expect that either."

for a few days snyte thought of suing roark and heller. but he decided against it, because 

there was no precedent to follow under the circumstances: because heller had paid him for 
his efforts, and the house had been actually designed by roark; and because no one ever 
sued austen heller. the first visitor to roark's office was peter keating. he walked in, without 
warning, one noon, walked straight across the room and sat down on roark's desk, smiling 
gaily, spreading his arms wide in a sweeping gesture: "well, howard!" he said. "well, fancy 
that!" he had not seen roark for a year. "hello, peter," said roark.

"your own office, your own name and everything! already! just imagine!"

"who told you, peter?"

"oh, one hears things. you wouldn't expect me not to keep track of your career, now would 
you? you know what i've always tho

ason. the owner will get good and sick of it and he'll come running home to a good 
old early colonial."

the heller house acquired fame throughout the countryside surrounding it. people drove out 
of their way to park on the road before it, to stare, point and giggle. gas-station attendants 
snickered when heller's car drove past. heller's cook had to endure the derisive glances of 
shopkeepers when she went on her errands. the heller house was known in the 
neighborhood as "the booby hatch."

peter keating told his friends in the profession, with an indulgent smile: "now, now, you 
shouldn't say that about him. i've known howard roark for a long time, and he's got quite a 
talent, quite. he's even worked for me once. he's just gone haywire on that house. he'll learn. 
he has a future....oh, you don't think he has? you really don't think he has?"

ellsworth m. toohey, who let no stone spring from the ground of america without his 
comment, did not know that the heller house had been erected, as fa

reserved it for him when so much else of greater import had been lost. he did not 
know why he had to see that moment again whenever he felt bitterness for his daughter, nor 
why, seeing it, he felt that unbearable twinge of tenderness. he told himself merely that his 
paternal affection was asserting itself quite against his will. but in an awkward, unthinking way 
he wanted to help her, not knowing, not wanting to know what she had to be helped against.

so he began to look more frequently at peter keating. he began to accept the solution which 
he never quite admitted to himself. he found comfort in the person of peter keating, and he 
felt that keating's simple, stable wholesomeness was just the support needed by the 
unhealthy inconstancy of his daughter.

keating would not admit that he had tried to see dominique again, persistently and without 
results. he had obtained her telephone number from francon long ago, and he had called her 
often. she had answered, and laughed gaily, and told him

ennett, while you'll be 
pounding the pavements looking for a job! but you'll have a wife! oh, yes, you'll have a wife!"

"mother, please..." he whispered, so desperately that she could allow herself to go on without 
restraint.

"this is the kind of a wife you'll have. a clumsy little girl who won't know where to put her 
hands or feet. a sheepish little thing who'll run and hide from any important person that you'll 
want to bring to the house. so you think you're so good? don't kid yourself, peter keating! no 
great man ever got there alone. don't you shrug it off, how much the right woman's helped the 
best of them. your francon didn't marry a chambermaid, you bet your life he didn't! just try to 
see things through other people's eyes for a bit. what will they think of your wife? what will 
they think of you? you don't make your living building chicken coops for soda jerkers, don't

 half closed, like 
claws; the fingers shook; he could not use his left hand at all. he would not retire. he liked to 
see his name on the firm's stationery.

he wondered dimly why he was no longer introduced to prominent clients, why he never saw 
the sketches of their new buildings, until they were half erected. if he mentioned this, francon 
protested: "but, lucius, i couldn't think of bothering you in your condition. any other man 
would have retired, long ago."

francon puzzled him mildly. peter keating baffled him. keating barely bothered to greet him 
when they met, and then as an afterthought; keating walked off in the middle of a sentence 
addressed to him; when heyer issued some minor order to one of the draftsmen, it was not 
carried out and the draftsman informed him that the order had been countermanded by mr. 
keating. heyer could not understand it; he always remembered keating as the diffident boy 
who had talked to him so nicely about old porcelain. he excused keating at first; then

as honest as you can make of a dishonest thing. now go home and try to work out something 
on this order."

keating went home. he copied roark's plans. he worked out roark's hasty sketch of the 
elevation into a neat, finished perspective. then the drawings were mailed, properly 
addressed to:
#

"the most beautiful building in the world" competition

cosmo-slotnick pictures, inc.

new york city.
#

the envelope, accompanying the entry, contained the names: "francon & heyer, architects, 
peter keating, associated designer."
#

through the months of that winter roark found no other chances, no offers, no prospects of 
commissions. he sat at his desk and forgot, at times, to turn on the lights in the early dusk. it 
was as if the heavy immobility of all the hours that had flowed through the office, of its door, of 
its air were beginning to seep into his muscles. he would rise and fling a book at the wall, to 
feel his arm move, to hear the burst of sound. he smiled, amused, picked up the boo

oh, yes, we're going to the horse show wednesday. i adore horse 
shows. good night, peter."

he left and walked home through the warm spring night. he walked savagely. if, at that 
moment, someone had offered him sole ownership of the firm of francon & heyer at the price 
of marrying dominique, he would have refused it. he knew also, hating himself, that he would 
not refuse, if it were offered to him on the following morning.

15.

this was fear. this was what one feels in nightmares, thought peter keating, only then one 
awakens when it becomes unbearable, but he could neither awaken nor bear it any longer. it 
had been growing, for days, for weeks, and now it had caught him: this lewd, unspeakable 
dread of defeat. he would lose the competition, he was certain that he would lose it, and the 
certainty grew as each day of waiting passed. he could not work; he jerked when people 
spoke to him; he had not slept for nights.

he walked toward the house of lucius heyer. he tried not to notice the fac

 keating leaned forward and snatched the letter from under his hand.

heyer looked at him, his head bent to one side, his mouth open. he looked as if he expected 
keating to strike him; with a sickening, pleading glance that said he would allow keating to 
strike him.

"please," whispered heyer, "you won't do that, will you? i don't feel very well. i've never hurt 
you. i seem to remember, i did something very nice for you once."

"what?" snapped keating. "what did you do for me?"

"your name's peter keating...peter keating...i remember...i did something nice for 
you....you're the boy guy has so much faith in. don't trust guy. i don't trust him. but i like you. 
we'll make you a designer one of these days." his mouth remained hanging open on the 
word. a thin strand of saliva trickled down from the corner of his mouth. "please...don't..."

keating's eyes were bright with disgust; aversion goaded him on; he had to make it worse 
because he couldn't stand it.

"you'll be exposed publicly," said keat

was selfish; everybody was selfish; it was not a pretty thing, to be selfish, but he was not alone 
in it; he had merely been luckier than most; he had been, because he was better than most; 
he felt fine; he hoped the useless questions would never come back to him again; every man 
for himself, he muttered, falling asleep on the table.

the useless questions never came back to him again. he had no time for them in the days 
that followed. he had won the cosmo-slotnick competition.
#

peter keating had known it would be a triumph, but he had not expected the thing that 
happened. he had dreamed of a sound of trumpets; he had not foreseen a symphonic 
explosion.

it began with the thin ringing of a telephone, announcing the names of the winners. then 
every phone in the office joined in, screaming, bursting from under the fingers of the operator 
who could barely control the switchboard; calls from every paper in town, from famous 
architects, questions, demands for interviews, congratulat

ting knew, the people he had never seen before, the reception clerk losing all sense, not 
knowing whom to admit or refuse, and keating shaking hands, an endless stream of hands 
like a wheel with soft moist cogs flapping against his fingers. he did not know what he said at 
that first interview, with francon's office full of people and cameras; francon had thrown the 
doors of his liquor cabinet wide-open. francon gulped to all these people that the cosmo-
slotnick building had been created by peter keating alone; francon did not care; he was 
magnanimous in a spurt of enthusiasm; besides, it made a good story.

it made a better story than francon had expected. from the pages of newspapers the face of 
peter keating looked upon the country, the handsome, wholesome, smiling face with the 
brilliant eyes and the dark curls; it headed columns of print about poverty, struggle, aspiration 
and unremitting toil that had won their reward; about the faith of a mother who had sacrificed 
everything to her

tly poor. they had discovered a boy genius; 
cosmo-slotnick adored boy geniuses; mr. slotnick was one himself, being only forty-three.

dispose of it quite simply. he chuckled with relief, he telephoned roark's office, and made an 
appointment to see him.

he went to that appointment confidently. for the first time in his life he felt free of the strange 
uneasiness which he had never been able to explain or escape in roark's presence. he felt 
safe now. he was through with howard roark.
#

roark sat at the desk in his office, waiting. the telephone had rung once, that morning, but it 
had been only peter keating asking for an appointment. he had forgotten now that keating 
was coming. he was waiting for the telephone. he had become dependent on that telephone 
in the last few weeks. he was to hear at any moment about his drawings for the manhattan 
bank company.

his rent on the office was long since overdue. so was the rent on the room where he lived. he 
did not care about the room; he could tell the landlord to wait; the landlord waited; it would not 
have mattered greatly if he had stopped waiting.

he closed his eyes. he thought he would allow himself to rest, just to rest blankly like this for a 
few minutes, before he would begin to think of what the date on the telephone notice had been
and in what way he could manage to last until monday.

"hello, howard," said peter keating.

he opened his eyes. keating had entered and stood before him, smiling. he wore a light tan 
spring coat, thrown open, the loops of its belt like handles at his sides, a blue cornflower in his 
buttonhole. he stood, his legs apart, his fists on his hips, his hat on the back of his head, his 
black curls so bright and crisp over his pale forehead that one expected to see drops of spring 
dew glistening on them as on the cornflower.

"hello, peter," said roark.

little pinheads of light flared up about the peak of one famous tower, in the windows of the 
star roof restaurant. then the train swerved around a bend and the city vanished.

that evening, in the banquet hall of the star roof restaurant, a dinner was held to celebrate 

the admittance of peter keating to partnership in the firm to be known henceforward as 
francon & keating.

at the long table that seemed covered, not with a tablecloth, but with a sheet of light, sat guy 
francon. somehow, tonight, he did not mind the streaks of silver that appeared on his 
temples; they sparkled crisply against the black of his hair and they gave him an air of 
cleanliness and elegance, like the rigid white of his shirt against his black evening clothes. in 
the place of honor sat peter keating. he leaned b

the future was simple. she had nothing to do except never to ask for his name. she had a

when peter keating entered the office, the opening of the door sounded like a single high 
blast on a trumpet. the door flew forward as if it had opened of itself to the approach of a man 
before whom all doors were to open in such manner.

his day in the office began with the newspapers. there was a neat pile of them waiting, 
stacked on his desk by his secretary. he liked to see what new mentions appeared in print 
about the progress of the cosmo-slotnick building or the firm of francon & keating.

there were n

where he held the post of lecturer on "art as a social symptom." he had given the simple 
explanation that he "did not believe in the institution of private inheritance." he had refused all 
further comment. "no, my friends," he had said, "not about this." and had added, with his 
charming knack for destroying the earnestness of his own moment: "i like to indulge in the 
luxury of commenting solely upon interesting subjects. i do not consider myself one of these."

peter keating read the story. and because he knew that it was an action which he would 
never have committed, he admired it tremendously.

then he thought, with a familiar twinge of annoyance, that he had not been able to meet 
ellsworth toohey. toohey had left on a lecture tour shortly after the award in the cosmo-
slotnick competition, and the brilliant gatherings keating had attended ever since were made 
empty by the absence of the one man he'd been most eager to meet. no mention of keating's 
name had a

brilliantly close--to what we designate loosely by the term of greatness. such a promise is 
looming on our architectural horizon in the person of a mere boy named peter keating.

man, but he experienced it in the moment when he saw the door opening under her hand. he 
wondered what toohey really looked like. he remembered the magnificent voice he had heard 
in the lobby of the strike meeting, and he imagined a giant of a man, with a rich mane of hair, 
perhaps just turning gray, with bold, broad features of an ineffable benevolence, something 
vaguely like the countenance of god the father.

"mr. peter keating--mr. toohey," said the secretary and closed the door behind him.

at a first glance upon ellsworth monkton toohey one wished to offer him a heavy, well-
padded overcoat--so frail and unprotected did his thin little body appear, like that of a chicken 
just emerging from the egg, in all the sorry fragility of unhardened bones. at a second glance 
one wished to be sure that the overcoat should be an exceedingly good one--so exquisite 
were the garments covering that body. the lines of the dark su

made the skull look tight and trim, but left too much emphasis to the ears that flared out in 
solitary nakedness, like the handles of a bouillon cup. the nose was long and thin, prolonged 
by the small dab of a black mustache. the eyes were dark and startling. they held such a 
wealth of intellect and of twinkling gaiety that his glasses seemed to be worn not to protect his 
eyes but to protect other men from their excessive brilliance.

"hello, peter keating," said ellsworth monkton toohey in his compelling, magical voice. "what 
do you think of the temple of nike apteros?"

"how...do you do, mr. toohey," said keating, stopped, stupefied. "what do i think...of what?"

"yes, of course," muttered keating, "that's always been my favorite--the temple of nike 
apteros."

"really?" said ellsworth toohey, with a smile which keating could not quite classify. "i was 
certain of it. i was certain you'd say it. you have a very handsome face, peter keating, when 
you don't stare like this--which is really quite unnecessary."

and toohey was laughing suddenly, laughing quite obviously, quite insultingly, at keating and 
at himself; it was as if he were underscoring the falseness of the whole procedure. keating sat 
aghast for an instant; and then he found himself laughing easily in answer, as if at home with 
a very old friend.

peter keating squinted his eyes, his glance unfocused as for a great distance, but put the 
book down. the book was thin and black, with scarlet letters forming: clouds and shrouds by 
lois cook. the jacket said that it was a record of miss cook's travels around the world.

peter keating had never felt the need to formulate abstract convictions. but he had a working 
substitute. "a thing is not high if one can reach it; it is not great if one can reason about it; it is 
not deep if one can see its bottom"--this had always been his credo, unstated and 
unquestioned. this spared him any attempt to reach, reason or see; and it cast a nice 
reflection of scorn on those who made the attempt. so he was able to enjoy the work of lois

whether she was anemic.

lois cook sat on the floor in the middle of her living room, her legs crossed turkish fashion, 
showing large bare knees, gray stockings rolled over tight garters, and a piece of faded pink 
drawers. peter keating sat on the edge of a violet satin chaise lounge. never before had he 
felt uncomfortable at a first interview with a client.

lois cook was thirty-seven. she had stated insistently, in her publicity and in private 
conversation, that she was sixty-four. it was repeated as a whimsical joke and it created about 

her name a vague impression of eternal youth. she was tall, dry, narrow-shouldered and 
broad-hipped. she had a long, sallow face, and eyes set close together. her hair hung about

quite clear to him just exactly what the revolt was against. somehow, he preferred not to 
know.

he designed the house as she wished it. it was a three-floor edifice, part marble, part stucco, 
adorned with gargoyles and carriage lanterns. it looked like a structure from an amusement 
park.

his sketch of it was reproduced in more publications than any other drawing he had ever 
made, with the exception of the cosmo-slotnick building. one commentator expressed the 
opinion that "peter keating is showing a promise of being more than just a bright young man 
with a knack for pleasing stuffy moguls of big business. he is venturing into the field of 
intellectual experimentation with a client such as lois cook." toohey referred to the house as 
"a cosmic joke."

but a peculiar sensation remained in keating's mind: the feeling of an aftertaste. he would 
experience a dim flash of it while working on some important structure he liked; he would 
experience it in the moments when he felt pr

two whirlpools; at the center of one stood ellsworth toohey, of the other--peter keating. 
evening clothes were not becoming to ellsworth toohey; the rectangle of white shirt front

added: "and that was the famous toohey technique. never place your punch at the beginning

"let's see," he said, studying the ceiling with casual attention, "those commissions you got for 
peter keating. the cryon office building was mere nuisance value--howard roark never had 
a chance at that. the lindsay home was better--roark was definitely considered, i think he 
would have got it but for you. the stonebrook clubhouse also--he had a chance at that, which 
you ruined." he looked at her and chuckled softly. "no comments on techniques and punches, 
dominique?" the smile was like cold grease floating over the fluid sounds of his voice. "you

he moved through formal receptions, theater parties, dinners, dances--gracious and 
smiling, a smile that made her face brighter and colder, like the sun on a winter day. she 
listened emptily to empty words uttered as if the speaker would be insulted by any sign of 
enthusiastic interest from his listener, as if only boredom were the only bond possible between 
people, the only preservative of their precarious dignity. she nodded to everything and 
accepted everything.

"yes, mr. holt, i think peter keating is the man of the century--our century."

"no, mr. inskip, not howard roark, you don't want howard roark....a phony? of course, he's 
a phony--it takes your sensitive honesty to evaluate the integrity of a man....nothing much? 
no, mr. inskip, of course, howard roark is nothing much. it's all a matter of size and 
distance--and distance....no, i don't think very much, mr. inskip--i'm glad you like my eyes--
yes, they always look like that when i'm enjoying myself--and it made me so happy to hea

she liked to wander about the room, to throw her gloves down among a litter of pencils, 
rubber erasers and rags, to put her small silver bag on a stained, discarded shirt, to snap 
open the catch of a diamond bracelet and drop it on a plate with the remnant of a sandwich, 
by an unfinished drawing.

"roark," she said, standing behind his chair, her arms over his shoulders, her hand under his 
shirt, fingers spread and pressed flat against his chest, "i made mr. symons promise his job to 
peter keating today. thirty-five floors, and anything he'll wish to make it cost, money no 
objective, just art, free art." she heard the sound of his soft chuckle, but he did not turn to look 
at her, only his fingers closed over her wrist and he pushed her hand farther down under his 
shirt, pressing it hard against his skin. then she pulled his head back, and she bent down to 
cover his mouth with hers.

she came in and found a copy of the banner spread out on his table, open at the page 
bearing "your ho

d of them," and walked into the bedroom while she obeyed. 
they had a silent agreement, understood without mention, never to be seen together. her 
bedroom was an exquisite place of glass and pale ice-green. he liked to come in wearing 
clothes stained by a day spent on the construction site. he liked to throw back the covers of 
her bed, then to sit talking quietly for an hour or two, not looking at the bed, not mentioning her 
writing or buildings or the latest commission she had obtained for peter keating, the simplicity 
of being at ease, here, like this, making the hours more sensual than the moments they 
delayed.

there were evenings when they sat together in her living room, at the huge window high over 
the city. she liked to see him at that window. he would stand, half turned to her, smoking, 
looking at the city below. she would move away from him and sit down on the floor in the 
middle of the room and watch him.

once, when he got out of bed, she switched the light on and saw him stand

herself saying it, she did not see him smiling, she did not recognize the full understanding in 
his face, she saw only his face close over hers, and she had nothing to hide from him, nothing 
to keep unstated, everything was granted, answered, found.

peter keating was bewildered. dominique's sudden devotion to his career seemed dazzling, 
flattering, enormously profitable; everybody told him so; but there were moments when he did 
not feel dazzled or flattered; he felt uneasy.

he tried to avoid guy francon. "how did you do it, peter? how did you do it?" francon would 
ask. "she must be crazy about you! who'd every think that dominique of all people would...? 
and who'd think she could? she'd have made me a millionaire if she'd done her stuff five

petent. there were no 
alternatives, no mitigating considerations. but if a man worked well, he needed nothing else to 
win his employer's benevolence: it was granted, not as a gift, but as a debt. it was granted, not 
as affection, but as recognition. it bred an immense feeling of self-respect within every man in 
that office.

"oh, but that's not human," said somebody when one of roark's draftsmen tried to explain this 
at home, "such a cold, intellectual approach!" one boy, a younger sort of peter keating, tried 
to introduce the human in preference to the intellectual in roark's office; he did not last two 
weeks. roark made mistakes in choosing his employees occasionally, not often; those whom 
he kept for a month became his friends for life. they did not call themselves friends; they did 
not praise him to outsiders; they did not talk about him. they knew only, in a dim way, that it 
was not loyalty to him, but to the best within themselves.

"you've always been, my dear. do forgive me. i should have known better than to be

it doesn't make me happy at all. there, you see? now your visit to my office has been a 
complete success. so we shall just write the aquitania off as a major defeat, forget all about it 
and continue as we were."

"certainly, ellsworth. just as we were. i'm cinching a beautiful new hospital for peter keating 
at a dinner party tonight."

ellsworth toohey went home and spent the evening thinking about hopton stoddard.

hopton stoddard was a little man worth twenty million dollars. three inheritances had 
contributed to that sum, and seventy-two years of a busy life devoted to the purpose of making
money. hopton stoddard had a genius for investment; he invested in everything--houses of ill 
fame, broadway spectacles on the grand scale, preferably of a religious nature, factories, 
farm mortgages and

shall have done mine. do not worry about the meaning i wish conveyed. let it be your spirit in 
the shape of a building--and it will have that meaning, whether you know it or not."

and so roark agreed to build the stoddard temple of the human spirit.

11.

in december the cosmo-slotnick building was opened with great ceremony. there were 
celebrities, flower horseshoes, newsreel cameras, revolving searchlights and three hours of 
speeches, all alike.

i should be happy, peter keating told himself--and wasn't. he watched from a window the 
solid spread of faces filling broadway from curb to curb. he tried to talk himself into joy. he felt 
nothing. he had to admit that he was bored. but he smiled and shook hands and let himself 
be photographed. the cosmo-slotnick building rose ponderously over the street, like a big 
white bromide.

after the ceremonies ellsworth toohey took keating away to the retreat of a pale-orchid booth 
in a quiet, expensive restaurant. many brilliant

that winter the annual costume arts ball was an event of greater brilliance and originality than 
usual. athelstan beasely, the leading spirit of its organization, had had what he called a stroke 
of genius: all the architects were invited to come dressed as their best buildings. it was a huge 
success.

peter keating was the star of the evening. he looked wonderful as the cosmo-slotnick 
building. an exact papier-mâché replica of his famous structure covered him from head to 
knees; one could not see his face, but his bright eyes peered from behind the windows of the 
top floor, and the crowning pyramid of the roof rose over his head; the colonnade hit him 
somewhere about the diaphragm, and he wagged a finger through the portals of the great 
entrance door. his legs were free to move with his usual elega

 heard of it.

"listen, dominique," he said angrily, "there is a limit. there really is a limit--even for you. why 
are you doing it? why--for a building of roark's of all things? after everything you've said and 
done against him--do you wonder people are talking? nobody'd care or notice if it were 
anyone else. but you--and roark! i can't go anywhere without having somebody ask me about 
it. what am i to do?"

"order yourself a reproduction of the statue, father. it's going to be beautiful."

peter keating refused to discuss it. but he met dominique at a party and he asked, having 
intended not to ask it:

"is it true that you're posing for a statue for roark's temple?"

"yes."

"dominique, i don't like it."

"no?"

"oh, i'm sorry. i know i have no right...it's only...it's only that of all people, i don't want to see 
you being friendly with roark. not roark. anybody but roark."

she looked interested: "why?"

"i don't know."

her glance of curious study worried him.

"maybe," he muttered, "mayb

leared. order was restored, but not to the faces of the crowd: 
the faces remained lecherously self-righteous. it was pleasant to be singled out and brought 
into the case as an injured party. three-fourths of them had never seen the stoddard temple.

"thank you, mr. toohey," said the attorney, faintly suggesting a bow. then he turned to roark 
and said with delicate courtesy: "your witness."

"no questions," said roark.

ellsworth toohey raised one eyebrow and left the stand regretfully.

"mr. peter keating!" called the attorney. peter keating's face looked attractive and fresh, as if 
he had had a good night's sleep. he mounted the witness stand with a collegiate sort of gusto, 
swinging his shoulders and arms unnecessarily. he took the oath and answered the first 
questions gaily. his pose in the witness chair was strange: his torso slumped to one side with 
swaggering ease, an elbow on the chair's arm; but his feet were planted awkwardly straight, 
and his knees were pressed tight together. he

a crime? why should anyone sneer at you for that, sneer all the time, all the time, day and 
night, not giving you a moment's peace, like the chinese water torture, you know where they 
drop water on your skull drop by drop?"

people in the audience began to realize that peter keating was drunk. the attorney frowned; 
the testimony had been rehearsed; but it was getting off the rails.

"well, now, mr. keating, perhaps you'd better tell us about mr. roark's views on architecture."

"i'll tell you, if you want to know. he thinks you should take your shoes off and kneel, when you 
speak of architecture. that's what he thinks. now why should you? why? it's a business like 
any other, isn't it? what's so damn sacred about it? why do we have to be all keyed up?

ompted by the same feeling. they did not talk 
about the trial, but there was no strain and no conscious avoidance of the subject. roark sat 
on his drafting table and talked to them about the future of the plastics industry. mallory 
laughed aloud suddenly, without apparent reason. "what's the matter, steve?" roark asked. "i 
just thought...howard, we all came here to help you, to cheer you up. but it's you who're 
helping us, instead. you're supporting your supporters, howard."

that evening, peter keating lay half-stretched across a table in a speakeasy, one arm 
extending along the table top, his face on his arm.

in the next two days a succession of witnesses testified for the plaintiff. every examination 
began with questions that brought out the professional achievements of the witness. the 
attorney gave them leads like an expert press agent. austen heller remarked that architects 
must have fought for the privilege of being called to the witness stand, since it was the

when the doorbell rang on the following evening toohey went to open the door himself.

he smiled when he admitted peter keating. after the trial he had expected keating to come to 
him; he knew that keating would need to come. but he had expected him sooner.

keating walked in uncertainly. his hands seemed too heavy for his wrists. his eyes were 
puffed, and the skin of his face looked slack.

"hello, peter," said toohey brightly. "want to see me? come right in. just your luck. i have 
the whole evening free."

"no," said keating. "i want to see katie."

he was not looking at toohey and he did not see the expression beh

tly, without shifting the positions of their 
bodies, when the car stopped for a light. they seemed caught in a single streak of motion, an 
imperative direction like the flight of a bullet that could not be stopped on its course. there 
was a first hint of twilight in the streets of the city. the pavements looked yellow. the shops 
were still open. a movie theater had lighted its sign, and the red bulbs whirled jerkily, sucking 
the last daylight out of the air, making the street look darker.

peter keating felt no need of speech. he did not seem to be peter keating any longer. he did 
not ask for warmth and he did not ask for pity. he asked nothing. she thought of that once, 
and she glanced at him, a glance of appreciation that was almost gentle. he met her eyes 
steadily; she saw understanding, but no comment. it was as if his glance said: "of course," 
nothing else.

they were out of the city, with a cold brown road flying to meet them, when he said:

ordered her to drive into the first side lane and he would have taken her there.

touching her. she did not move, resist or turn to look at him. he pulled his arm away, and he 
sat staring straight ahead.

"mrs. keating," he said flatly, not addressing her, just as a statement of fact.

"mrs. peter keating," she said.

when they stopped in front of his apartment house, he got out and held the door for her, but 
she remained sitting behind the wheel.

"good night, peter," she said. "i'll see you tomorrow."

she added, before the expression of his face had turned into an obscene swearword: "i'll send 
my things over tomorrow and we'll discuss everything then. everything will begin tomorrow, 
peter."

"where are you going?"

"i have things to settle."

"but what will i tell people tonight?"

other end of the room, his back turned to her for a moment, when she said, 
"roark," her voice quiet and low.

he turned to her, as if he had expected it and, perhaps, guessed the rest.

she stood in the middle of the floor, as she had stood on her first night in this room, solemnly 
composed to the performance of a rite.

"i love you, roark."

she had said it for the first time.

she saw the reflection of her next words on his face before she had pronounced them.

"i was married yesterday. to peter keating."

it would have been easy, if she had seen a man distorting his mouth to bite off sound, closing 
his fists and twisting them in defense against himself. but it was not easy, because she did not 
see him doing this, yet knew that this was being done, without the relief of a physical gesture.

"roark..." she whispered, gently, frightened.

he said: "i'm all right." then he said: "please wait a moment...all right. go on."

"roark, before i met you, i had always been afraid of seeing someone like

exists--and you. it would mean to struggle against things and men who don't deserve to be 
your opponents. your fight, using their methods--and that's too horrible a desecration. it would 
mean doing for you what i did for peter keating: lie, flatter, evade, compromise, pander to 
every ineptitude--in order to beg of them a chance for you, beg them to let you live, to let you 
function, to beg them, roark, not to laugh at them, but to tremble because they hold the power 
to hurt you. am i too weak because i can't do this? i don't know which is the greater strength: 
to accept all this for you--or to love you so much that the rest is beyond acceptance. i don't 
know. i love you too much."

he looked at her, waiting. she knew th

at he had understood this long ago, but that it had to be

"you're not aware of them. i am. i can't help it, i love you. the contrast is too great. roark, you 
won't win, they'll destroy you, but i won't be there to see it happen. i will have destroyed myself 
first. that's the only gesture of protest open to me. what else could i offer you? the things 
people sacrifice are so little. i'll give you my marriage to peter keating. i'll refuse to permit 
myself happiness in their world. i'll take suffering. that will be my answer to them, and my gift 
to you. i shall probably never see you again. i shall try not to. but i will live for you, through 
every minute and every shameful act i take, i will live for you in my own way, in the only way i

pain and the ugliness, being first to choose the worst it can do to me. not as the wife of some 
half-decent human being, but as the wife of peter keating. and only within my own mind, only 
where nothing can touch it, kept sacred by the protecting wall of my own degradation, there 
will be the thought of you and the knowledge of you, and i shall say 'howard roark to myself 
once in a while, and i shall feel that i have deserved to say it." she stood before him, her face 
raised; her lips were not drawn, but closed softly, yet the shape of her mouth was too definite 
on her face, a shape of pain and tenderness, and resignation.

then he kissed her and let her go.

15.

at nine o'clock that morning peter keating was pacing the floor of his room, his door 
locked. he forgot that it was nine o'clock and that catherine was waiting for him. he had made 
himself forget her and everything she implied.

the door of his room was locked to protect him from his mother. last night, seeing his furious 
restlessness, she had forced him to tell her the truth. he had snapped that he was married to 
dominique francon, and he had added some sort of explanation about dominique going out 
of town to announce the marriage

next morning, entering the dining room for breakfast, dominique found a florist's box, long 
and white, resting across her plate.

"what's that?" she asked the maid.

"it was brought this morning, madam, with instructions to be put on the breakfast table."

the box was addressed to mrs. peter keating. dominique opened it. it contained a few 
branches of white lilac, more extravagantly luxurious than orchids at this time of the year. 
there was a small card with a name written upon it in large letters that still held the quality of a 
hand's dashing movement, as if the letters were laughing on the pasteboard: "ellsworth m.

"how nice!" said keating. "i wondered why we hadn't heard from him at all yesterday."

"please put them in water, mary," said dominique, handing the box to the

hopton stoddard added a generous sum to the award he had won from roark, and the 
stoddard temple was rebuilt for its new purpose by a group of architects chosen by ellsworth 
toohey: peter keating, gordon l. prescott, john erik snyte and somebody named gus 
webb, a boy of twenty-four who liked to utter obscenities when passing well-bred women on 
the street, and who had never handled an architectural commission of his own. three of these 
men had social and professional standing; gus webb had none; toohey included him for that 
reason. of the four gus webb had the loudest voice and the greatest self-assurance. gus 
webb said he was afraid of nothing; he meant it. they were all members of

containing dormitories, schoolrooms, infirmary, kitchen, laundry. the entrance hall was paved 
with colored marble, the stairways had railings of hand-wrought aluminum, the shower stalls 
were glass-enclosed, the recreation rooms had gold-leafed corinthian pilasters. the huge 
windows were left untouched, merely crossed by floorlines.

the four architects had decided to achieve an effect of harmony and therefore not to use any 
historical style in its pure form. peter keating designed the white marble semi-doric portico 
that rose over the main entrance, and the venetian balconies for which new doors were cut. 
john erik snyte designed the small semi-gothic spire surmounted by a cross, and the 
bandcourses of stylized acanthus leaves which were cut into the limestone of the walls. 
gordon l. prescott designed the semi-renaissance cornice, and the glass-enclosed terrace 
projecting from the third floor. gus webb designed a cubistic ornament to frame the original

if toohey's eyes had not been fixed insolently on wynand's, he would have been ordered out 
of the office at once. but the glance told wynand that toohey knew to what extent he had 
been plagued by people recommending architects and how hard he had tried to avoid them; 
and that toohey had outwitted him by obtaining this interview for a purpose wynand had not 
expected. the impertinence of it amused wynand, as toohey had known it would.

"all right, mr. toohey. whom are you selling?"

"peter keating."

"well?"

"i beg your pardon?"

"well, sell him to me."

toohey was stopped, then shrugged brightly and plunged in:

"you understand, of course, that i'm not connected with mr. keating in any way. i'm acting only
as his friend--and yours." the voice sounded pleasantly informal, but it had lost some of its 
certainty. "honestly, i know it does sound trite, but what else can i say? it just happens to be 
the truth." wynand would not help him out. "i presumed to come here because i felt it was m

imagination. that, mr. wynand, is my sincere opinion."

"i quite believe you."

"you do?"

"of course. but, mr. toohey, why should i consider your opinion?"

"well, after all, i am your architectural expert!" he could not keep the edge of anger out of his 
voice.

"my dear, mr. toohey, don't confuse me with my readers." after a moment, toohey leaned 
back and spread his hands out in laughing helplessness.

"frankly, mr. wynand, i didn't think my word would ca

"no? what did you intend?"

"only to ask that you give half an hour of your time to someone who can convince you of peter

"who is that?"

"mrs. peter keating."

"why should i wish to discuss this matter with mrs. peter keating?"

"because she is an exceedingly beautiful woman and an extremely difficult one."

wynand threw his head back and laughed aloud.

"good god, toohey, am i as obvious as that?"

toohey, blinked, unprepared.

"really, mr. toohey, i owe you an apology, if, by allowing my tastes to become so well known, 
i caused you to be so crude. but i had no idea that among your many other humanitarian 
activities you were also a pimp."

toohey rose to his feet.

"sorry to disappoint you, mr. toohey. i have no

another chance to discuss this with you. i took the liberty of sending you a present. when you 
get home tonight, you will find my gift there. then, if you feel that i was justified in expecting 
you to do so, you can telephone me and i shall come over at once so that you will be able to

your job for."

"i shall rest upon your opinion of my present tonight."

"all right, mr. toohey, i'll look at your present."

toohey bowed and turned to go. he was at the door when wynand added:

"you know, toohey, one of these days you'll bore me."

"why, no, mr. wynand. i've made you a present of it. i intended you only to understand that 
this is mrs. peter keating."

wynand looked at the statue, then back at toohey.

"oh you damn fool!" said wynand softly.

toohey stared at him, bewildered.

"so you really did use this as a red lamp in a window?" wynand seemed relieved; he did not 
find it necessary to hold toohey's glance now. "that's better, toohey. you're not as smart as i 
thought for a moment."

"but, mr. wynand, what...?"

"did

 get out of here."

"yes, mr. wynand. i wish you a good night."

wynand accompanied him to the hall. at the door wynand said:

"you're a poor businessman, toohey. i don't know why you're so anxious to have me meet 
mrs. keating. i don't know what your racket is in trying to get a commission for that keating of 
yours. but whatever it is, it can't be so valuable that you should have been willing to part with a 
thing like this in exchange."

"why didn't you wear your emerald bracelet?" asked peter keating. "gordon prescott's so-
called fiancee had everybody gaping at her star sapphire."

"i'm sorry, peter. i shall wear it next time," said dominique.

"it was a nice party. did you have a good time?"

"i always have a good time."

"so did i...only...oh god, do you want to know the truth?"

"no."

"dominique, i was bored to death. vincent knowlton is a pain in the neck. he's such a damn 
snob. i can't stand him." he added cautiously: "i didn't show it, did i?"

"no. you behaved very well. you laugh

"don't you think it would be an interesting experience for all concerned?"

"you're not satisfied with the way my marriage has turned out, are you, ellsworth?"

"not entirely. just about fifty percent. well, nothing's perfect in this world. one gathers what 
one can and then one tries further."

"you were very anxious to have peter marry me. you knew what the result would be, better 
than peter or i."

"peter didn't know it at all."

"well, it worked--fifty percent. you got peter keating where you wanted him--the leading 
architect of the country who's now mud clinging to your galoshes."

"i've never liked your style of expression, but it's always been accurate. i should have said: 
who's now a soul wagging its tail. your style is gentler."

"but the other fifty percent, ellsworth? a failure?"

"approximately total. my fault. i should have known better than to expect anyone like peter 
keating, even in the role of husband, to destroy you."

"well, you're frank."

"i told you on

that annoyed me yesterday morning. he's too observant. so i decided the time was right."

"and there was stoneridge."

"and there was stoneridge. i knew that part of it would appeal to you. you'd never sell yourself 
to save your country, your soul or the life of a man you loved. but you'll sell yourself to get a 
commission he doesn't deserve for peter keating. see what will be left of you afterward. or of 
gail wynand. i'll be interested to see it, too."

"quite correct, ellsworth."

"all of it? even the part about a man you loved--if you did?"

"yes."

"you wouldn't sell yourself for roark? though, of course, you don't like to hear that name 
pronounced."

"howard roark," she said evenly.

"you have a great deal of courage, dominique."

keating returned, carrying a tray of cocktails. his eyes were feverish and he made too many 
gestures.

"it doesn't matter."

toohey had expected wynand to call for him after the interview with dominique. wynand had 
not called. but a few days later, meeting toohey by chance in the city room, wynand asked 
aloud:

"mr. toohey, have so many people tried to kill you that you can't remember their names?"

toohey smiled and said: "i'm sure quite so many would like to."

"you flatter your fellow men," said wynand, walking away.

peter keating stared at the brilliant room of the restaurant. it was the most exclusive place in 
town, and the most expensive. keating gloated, chewing the thought that he was here as the 
guest of gail wynand.

he tried not to stare at the gracious elegance of wynand's figure across the table. he blessed 
wynand for having chosen to give this dinner in a public place. people were gaping at 
wynand--discreetly and with practiced camouflage, but gaping nevertheless--and their 
attention included the two gues

he let her go. she knew he had noticed. he smiled and said:

"you're tired, dominique. shall i say good night? i want to remain here for a while."

she turned obediently and walked alone down to her cabin.

"what's the matter? don't i get stoneridge?" snapped peter keating.

dominique walked into the living room. he followed, waiting in the open door. the elevator boy
brought in her luggage, and left. she said, removing her gloves:

"you'll get stoneridge, peter. mr. wynand will tell you the rest himself. he wants to see you 
tonight. at eight-thirty. at his home."

"why in hell?"

"he'll tell you."

"you've heard of him. his name is gail wynand."

she saw his eyes. she thought she should want to laugh; she had brought him at last to a 
shock she had never expected to achieve. but she did not laugh. he thought of henry 
cameron; of cameron saying: i have no answer to give them, howard. i'm leaving you to face 
them. you'll answer them. all of them, the wynand papers and what makes the wynand 
papers possible and what lies behind that.

"roark."

he didn't answer.

"that's worse than peter keating, isn't it?" she asked.

"much worse."

"do you want to stop me?"

"no."

he had not touched her since he had released her elbow, and that had been only a touch 
proper in an ambulance. she moved her hand and let it rest against his. he did not withdraw 
his fingers and he did not pretend indifference. she bent over, holding his hand, not raising it 
from his knee, and she pressed her lips to his hand. her hat fell off, he saw the blond head at 
his knees, he felt her mouth kissing his hand agai

"where's it covered, gus?" asked lois cook.

"'who had been nothing shall be all,' sister."

"gus is crude, but deep," said ike. "i like him."

"go to hell," said gus.

lois cook's butler entered the room. he was a stately, elderly man and he wore full-dress 
evening clothes. he announced peter keating.

"pete?" said lois cook gaily. "why, sure, shove him in, shove him right in."

keating entered and stopped, startled, when he saw the gathering.

"oh...hello, everybody," he said bleakly. "i didn't know you had company, lois."

"that's not company. come in, pete, sit down, grab yourself a drink, you know everybody."

"hello, ellsworth," said keating, his eyes resting on toohey for support.

modest proportions it embodies all the grim simplicity of the new discipline and presents an 
invigorating example of the grandeur of the little. it was designed by augustus webb, a 
young architect of great promise."

meeting toohey a few days later, peter keating asked, disturbed:

"say, ellsworth, did you mean it?"

"what?"

"about modern architecture."

"of course i meant it. how did you like my little piece?"

"oh, i thought it was very beautiful. very convincing. but say, ellsworth, why...why did you pick 
gus webb? after all, i've done some modernistic things in the last few years. the palmer 
building was quite bare, and the mowry building was nothing but roof and windows, and the

at a luncheon where he had to speak on architecture, peter keating stated:

"in reviewing my career to date, i came to the conclusion that i have worked on a true 
principle: the principle that constant change is a necessity of life. since buildings are an 
indispensable part of life, it follows that architecture must change constantly. i have never 
developed any architectural prejudices for myself, but insisted on keeping my mind open to all 
the voices of the times. the fanatics who went around preaching that all structures must be 
modern were just as narr

designed in the classical tradition. they were an answer to the need of their era. neither do i 
apologize for the buildings which i designed in the modern style. they represent the coming 
better world. it is my opinion that in the humble realization of this principle lies the reward and 
the joy of being an architect."

there was gratifying publicity, and many flattering comments of envy in professional circles, 
when the news of peter keating's selection to build stoneridge was made public. he tried to 
recapture his old pleasure in such manifestations. he failed. he still felt something that 

resembled gladness, but it was faded and thin.

the effort of designing stoneridge seemed a load too vast to lift. he did not mind the 
circumstances through which he had obtained it; that, too, had become pale and weightless in 
his mind, accepted and almost forgotten. he simply could not face the task of designing the 
great number of hous

he had said: "i expected it. it's all right, peter. it's probably not your fault nor hers." he had not 
mentioned it since. now he gave no explanation of his retirement, only: "i told you it was 
coming, long ago. i'm tired. good luck, peter."

the responsibility of the firm on his lonely shoulders and the prospect of his solitary name on 
the office door left keating uneasy. he needed a partner. he chose neil dumont. neil had 
grace and distinction. he was another lucius heyer. the firm became peter keating & 
cornelius dumont. some sort of drunken celebration of the event was held by a few friends, 
but keating did not attend it. he had promised to attend, but he forgot about it, went for a 
solitary weekend in the snowbound country, and did not remember the celebration until the 
morning after it was held, when he was walking alone down a frozen country road.

stoneridge was the last contract signed by the firm of francon & keating.

"the incident illustrates to perfection," wrote ellsworth toohey, "the antisocial nature of mr. 
howard roark's egotism, the arrogance of the unbridled individualism which he has always 
personified."

among the eight chosen to design "the march of the centuries" were peter keating, gordon

it was only when the last painter had departed that peter keating felt a sense of desolation 
and a numb weakness in the crook of his elbows. he stood in the hall, looking up at the 
ceiling. under the harsh gloss of paint he could still see the outline of the square where the 
stairway had been removed and the opening closed over. guy francon's old office was gone. 
the firm keating & dumont had a single floor left now.

he thought of the stairway and how he had walked up its red-plushed steps for the first time,

movement of men returning to work, and knew that office hours had begun, here and 
everywhere else in the city--he rose, walked to his desk and reached for the telephone book. 
he dialed the number.

"this is peter keating speaking. i should like to make an appointment to see mr. roark."

photograph captioned: "architects' drawing of cortlandt homes, the $15,000,000 federal 
housing project to be built in astoria, l. i., keating & dumont, architects."

roark glanced at the photograph and asked: "what do you mean?"

"you know damn well what i mean. do you think i picked the things in my art gallery by their 
signatures? if peter keating designed this, i'll eat every copy of today's banner."

"peter keating designed this, gail."

you say."

it had stopped raining, but peter keating wished it would start again. the pavements 
glistened, there were dark blotches on the walls of buildings, and since it did not come from 
the sky, it looked as if the city were bathed in cold sweat. the air was heavy with untimely 
darkness, disquieting like premature old age, and there were yellow puddles of light in 
windows. keating had missed the rain, but he felt wet, from his bones out.

smile, the glance went back to the book title, to finish and make an efficient note of it. then 
her eyes returned to keating. her smile was pleasant; not as an effort over bitterness, and not 
as welcome; just pleasant.

"why, peter keating," she said. "hello, peter."

in the afternoon, alone at his desk, he opened a newspaper. he had not seen a newspaper for 
three months. he noticed an item about the construction of cortlandt homes. he saw the line: 
"peter keating, architect. gordon l. prescott and augustus webb, associate designers." he 
sat very still.

that evening he went to see cortlandt. the first building was almost completed. it stood alone 
on the large, empty tract. the workers had left for the day; a small light showed in the shack of
the night watchman. the building had the skeleton of what roark had designed, with the 
remnants of ten different breeds piled on the lovely symmetry of the bones. he saw the 
economy of plan preserved, but the e

gordon l. prescott and gus webb were entertained at dinners and cocktail parties; they were 
treated with tender, curious solicitude, like survivors of disaster. they said that they could not 
understand what possible motive roark could have had, and they demanded justice.

peter keating went nowhere. he refused to see the press. he refused to see anyone. but he 
issued a written statement that he believed roark was not guilty. his statement contained one 

curious sentence, the last. it said: "leave him alone, please can't you leave him alone?"

pickets from the council of american builders paced in front of the cord building. it served no 
purpose, because there was no work in roark's office. the commissions he was to start had 
been canceled.

promise was broken. the love of a man for the integrity of his work and his right to preserve it 
are now considered a vague intangible and an unessential. you have heard the prosecutor
