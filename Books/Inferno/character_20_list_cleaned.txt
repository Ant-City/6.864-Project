[CHARACTER] - 
sinners condemned to the third ring of the ninth
circle of hell. [CHARACTER] are unlike the other
sinners dante encounters: their crimes were deemed to be so great that
devils snatched their souls from their living bodies; thus, their
souls reside in hell while their bodies live on, now guided and
possessed by demons.
