and bear him home for his recovery.

_sec. mer._ i am sorry now that i did draw on him.

_abb._ how long hath this possession held the man?

_adr._ this week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,                     45
and much different from the man he was;

_adr._ i will not hence, and leave my husband here:
and ill it doth beseem your holiness                               110
to separate the husband and the wife.

_adr._ come, go: i will fall prostrate at his feet,
and never rise until my tears and prayers                          115
have won his grace to come in person hither,
and take perforce my husband from the abbess.

_sec. mer._ by this, i think, the dial points at five:
anon, i’m sure, the duke himself in person
comes this way to the melancholy vale,                             120
the place of death and sorry execution,
behind the ditches of the abbey here.

_ang._ upon what cause?

_sec. mer._ to see a reverend syracusian merchant,
who put unluckily into this bay                                    125
against the laws and statutes of this town,
beheaded publicly for his offence.

if any friend will pay the sum for him,
he shall not die; so much we tender him.

_adr._ justice, most sacred duke, against the abbess!

_duke._ she is a virtuous and a reverend lady:
it cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.                        135

_adr._ may it please your grace, antipholus my husband,--
whom i made lord of me and all i had,
at your important letters,--this ill day
a most outrageous fit of madness took him;
that desperately he hurried through the street,--                  140
with him his bondman, all as mad as he,--
doing displeasure to the citizens
by rushing in their houses, bearing the

ake order for the wrongs i went,
that here and there his fury had committed.
anon, i wot not by what strong escape,
he broke from those that had the guard of him;
and with his mad attendant and himself,                            150
each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,
met us again, and, madly bent on us,
chased us away; till, raising of more aid,
we came again to bind them. then they fled
into this abbey, whither we pursued them;                          155
and here the abbess shuts the gates on us,
and will not suffer us to fetch him out,
nor send him forth, that we may bear him hence.
therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command
let him be brought forth, and borne hence for help.                160

_duke._ long since thy husband served me in my wars;
and i to thee engaged a prince’s word,
when thou didst make him master of thy bed,
to do him all the grace and good i could.

my master and his man are both broke loose,
beaten the maids a-row, and bound the doctor,                      170
whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire;
and ever, as it blazed, they threw on him
great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair:
my master preaches patience to him, and the while
his man with scissors nicks him like a fool;

if he were mad, he would not plead so coldly:
you say he dined at home; the goldsmith here
denies that saying. sirrah, what say you?

_dro. e._ sir, he dined with her there, at the porpentine.         275

_cour._ he did; and from my finger snatch’d that ring.

_ant. e._ ’tis true, my liege; this ring i had of her.

_duke._ saw’st thou him enter at the abbey here?

_cour._ as sure, my liege, as i do see your grace.

_duke._ why, this is strange. go call the abbess hither.           280
i think you are all mated, or stark mad.

haply i see a friend will save my life,
and pay the sum that may deliver me.

_æge._ is not your name, sir, call’d antipholus?
and is not that your bondman, dromio?

but he, i thank him, gnaw’d in two my cor

ut seven years since, in syracusa, boy,
thou know’st we parted: but perhaps, my son,                       320
thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery.

_ant. e._ the duke and all that know me in the city
can witness with me that it is not so:
i ne’er saw syracusa in my life.

_duke._ i tell thee, syracusian, twenty years                      325

during which time he ne’er saw syracusa:
