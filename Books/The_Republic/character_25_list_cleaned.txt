[CHARACTER] - 
                 the
principle of [CHARACTER] states that every man must fulfill the
societal role to which nature best suits him, and should refrain
from engaging in any other business. those naturally suited to farm
should farm, those naturally suited to heal should be doctors, those naturally
suited to fight should be warriors, those naturally suited to be
philosophers should rule, and so on. plato believes that this simple
rule is the guiding principle of society, and the source of political
justice.
