r own
house, as she kept one maid-servant, she always took care to chuse her
out of that order of females whose faces are taken as a kind of
security for their virtue; of which number jenny jones, as the reader
hath been before informed, was one.

as the face of this young woman might be called pretty good security
of the before-mentioned kind, and as her behaviour had been always
extremely modest, which is the certain consequence of understanding in
women; she had passed above four years at mr partridge’s (for that was
the schoolmaster’s name) without creating the least suspicion in her
mistress. nay, she had been treated with uncommon kindness, and her
mistress had permitted mr partridge to give her those instructions
which have been before commemorated.

but it is with jealousy as with the gout: when such distempers are in
the blood, there is never any security against their breaking out; and
that often on the slightest occasions, and when least suspected.

thus it happened to mrs partri

reinforcement of additional strength before he openly declares himself
and proceeds upon hostile operations: and such additional strength
soon arrived to corroborate her suspicion; for not long after, the
husband and wife being at dinner, the master said to his maid, _da
mihi aliquid potum:_ upon which the poor girl smiled, perhaps at the
badness of the latin, and, when her mistress cast her eyes on her,
blushed, possibly with a consciousness of having laughed at her
master. mrs partridge, upon this, immediately fell into a fury, and
discharged the trencher on which she was eating, at the head of poor
jenny, crying out, “you impudent whore, do you play tricks with my
husband before my face?” and at the same instant rose from her chair
with a knife in her hand, with which, most probably, she would have
executed very tragical vengeance, had not the girl taken the advantage
of being nearer the door than her mistress, and avoided her fury by
running away: for, as to the poor hus

obliged to retreat, after the example of the maid.

she therefore ordered jenny immediately to pack up her alls and
begone, for that she was determined she should not sleep that night
within her walls.

mr partridge had profited too much by experience to interpose in a
matter of this nature. he therefore had recourse to his usual receipt
of patience, for, though he was not a great adept in latin, he
remembered, and well understood, the advice contained in these words

     --_leve fit quod bene fertur onus_

in english:

     a burden becomes lightest when it is well borne--

which he had always in his mouth; and of which, to say the truth, he
had often occasion to experience the truth.

was too strong for her to be heard. she then betook herself to the
business of packing, for which a small quantity of brown paper
sufficed, and, having received her small pittance of wages, she
returned home.

the schoolmaster and his consort passed their time unpleasantly enough
that evening, but something or other happened before the next morning,
which a little abated the fury of mrs partridge; and she at length
admitted her husband to make his excuses: to which she gave the
readier belief, as he had, instead of desiring her to recall jenny,
professed a satisfaction in her being dismissed, saying, she was grown
of little use as a servant, spending all her time in reading, and was
become, moreover, very pert and obstinate; for, indeed, she and her
master had lately had frequent disputes in literature; in which, as
hath been said, she was become greatly his superior. this, however, he

chapter iv.

containing one of the most bloody battles, or rather duels, that were
ever recorded in domestic history.


for the reasons mentioned in the preceding chapter, and from some
other matrimonial concessions, well known to most husbands, and which,
like the secrets of freemasonry, should be divulged to none who are
not members of that honourable fraternity, mrs partridge was pretty
well satisfied that she had condemned her husband without cause, and
endeavoured by acts of kindness to make him amends for her false
suspicion. her passions were indeed equally violent, whichever way
they inclined; for as she could be extremely angry, so could she be
altogether as fond.

but though these passions ordinarily succeed each other, and scarce
twenty-four hours ever passed in which the pedagogue was not, in some
degree, the object of both; yet, on extraordinary occasions,
 
 ___________________________
 
 when the
passion of anger had raged very high, the remission was usually
longer: and so was the case at present; for she continued longer in a
state of affability, after this fit of jealousy was ended, than her
husband had ever known before: and, had it not been for some little
exercises, which all the followers of xantippe are obliged to perform
daily, mr partridge would have enjoyed a perfect serenity of several
months.

perfect calms at sea are always suspected by the experienced mariner
to be the forerunners of a storm, and i know some persons, who,
without being generally the devotees of superstition, are apt to
apprehend that great and unusual peace or tranquillity will be
attended with its opposite. for which reason the antients used, on
such occasions, to sacrifice to the goddess nemesis, a deity who was
thought by them to look with an invidious ey

curiosity, seeing they are in this no way inferior to the other half
of the species.

in enjoying, therefore, such place of rendezvous, the british fair
ought to esteem themselves more happy than any of their foreign
sisters; as i do not remember either to have read in history, or to
have seen in my travels, anything of the like kind.

this place then is no other than the chandler’s shop, the known seat
of all the news; or, as it is vulgarly called, gossiping, in every
parish in england.

mrs partridge being one day at this assembly of females, was asked by
one of her neighbours, if she had heard no news lately of jenny jones?
to which she answered in the negative. upon this the other replied,
with a smile, that the parish was very much obliged to her for having
turned jenny away as she did.

mrs partridge, whose jealousy, as the reader well knows, was long
since cured, and who had no other quarrel to her maid, answered
boldly, she did not know any obligation the parish had to her on that
acc

ount; for she believed jenny had scarce left her equal behind her.

“no, truly,” said the gossip, “i hope not, though i fancy we have
sluts enow too. then you have not heard, it seems, that she hath been
brought to bed of two bastards? but as they are not born here, my
husband and the other overseer says we shall not be obliged to keep
them.”

“two bastards!” answered mrs partridge hastily: “you surprize me! i
don’t know whether we must keep them; but i am sure they must have
been begotten here, for the wench hath not been nine months gone
away.”

nothing can be so quick and sudden as the operations of the mind,
especially when hope, or fear, or jealousy, to which the two others
are but journeymen, set it to work. it occurred instantly to her, that
jenny had scarce ever been out of her own house while she lived with
her. the leaning over the chair, the sudden starti

enerates not in ferocity from the elder branches of her house, and
though inferior in strength, is equal in fierceness to the noble tiger
himself, when a little mouse, whom it hath long tormented in sport,
escapes from her clutches for a while, frets, scolds, growls, swears;
but if the trunk, or box, behind which the mouse lay hid be again
removed, she flies like lightning on her prey, and, with envenomed
wrath, bites, scratches, mumbles, and tears the little animal.

not with less fury did mrs partridge fly on the poor pedagogue. her
tongue, teeth, and hands, fell all upon him at once. his wig was in an
instant torn from his head, his shirt from his back, and from his face
descended five streams of blood, denoting the number of claws with
which nature had unhappily armed the enemy.

mr partridge acted for some time on the defensive only; indeed he
attempted only to guard his face with his hands; but as he found that
his antagonist abated nothing of her rage, he thought he might, at
least, ende

 reach her shoulders, erected itself on her head; her stays
likewise, which were laced through one single hole at the bottom,
burst open; and her breasts, which were much more redundant than her
hair, hung down below her middle; her face was likewise marked with
the blood of her husband: her teeth gnashed with rage; and fire, such
as sparkles from a smith’s forge, darted from her eyes. so that,
altogether, this amazonian heroine might have been an object of terror
to a much bolder man than mr partridge.

he had, at length, the good fortune, by getting possession of her
arms, to render those weapons which she wore at the ends of her
fingers useless; which she no sooner perceived, than the softness of
her sex prevailed over her rage, and she presently dissolved in tears,
which soon after concluded in a fit.

that small share of sense which mr partridge had hitherto preserved
through this scene of fury, of the cause of which he was hitherto
ignorant, now utterly abandoned him. he ran instantly i

nto the street,
hallowing out that his wife was in the agonies of death, and
beseeching the neighbours to fly with the utmost haste to her
assistance. several good women obeyed his summons, who entering his
house, and applying the usual remedies on such occasions, mrs
partridge was at length, to the great joy of her husband, brought to
herself.

as soon as she had a little recollected her spirits, and somewhat
composed herself with a cordial, she began to inform the company of
the manifold injuries she had received from her husband; who, she
said, was not contented to injure her in her bed; but, upon her
upbraiding him with it, had treated her in the cruelest manner
imaginable; had tore her cap and hair from her head, and her stays
from her body, giving her, at the sa

ry to the grave.

the poor man, who bore on his face many more visible marks of the
indignation of his wife, stood in silent astonishment at this
accusation; which the reader will, i believe, bear witness for him,
had greatly exceeded the truth; for indeed he had not struck her once;
and this silence being interpreted to be a confession of the charge by
the whole court, they all began at once, _una voce_, to rebuke and
revile him, repeating often, that none but a coward ever struck a
woman.

mr partridge bore all this patiently; but when his wife appealed to
the blood on her face, as an evidence of his barbarity, he could not
help laying claim to his own blood, for so it really was; as he
thought it very unnatural, that this should rise up (as we are taught
that of a murdered person often doth) in vengeance against him.

to this the women made no other answer, than that it was a pity it had
not come from his heart, instead of his face; all declaring, that, if
their husbands should lift their ha

nds against them, they would have
their hearts’ bloods out of their bodies.

after much admonition for what was past, and much good advice to mr
partridge for his future behaviour, the company at length departed,
and left the husband and wife to a personal conference together, in
which mr partridge soon learned the cause of all his sufferings.



chapter v.

containing much matter to exercise the judgment and reflection of the
reader.


i believe it is a true observation, that few secrets are divulged to
one person only; but certainly, it would be next to a miracle that a
fact of this kind should be known to a whole parish, and not transpire
any farther.

and, indeed, a very few days had past, before the country, to use a
common phrase, rung of the schoolmaster of little baddington; who w

as
said to have beaten his wife in the most cruel manner. nay, in some
places it was reported he had murdered her; in others, that he had
broke her arms; in others, her legs: in short, there was scarce an
injury which can be done to a human creature, but what mrs partridge
was somewhere or other affirmed to have received from her husband.

the cause of this quarrel was likewise variously reported; for as some
people said that mrs partridge had caught her husband in bed with his
maid, so many other reasons, of a very different kind, went abroad.
nay, some transferred the guilt to the wife, and the jealousy to the
husband.

mrs wilkins had long ago heard of this quarrel; but, as a different
cause from the true one had reached her ears, she thought proper to
conceal it; and the rather, perhaps, as the blame was universally laid
on mr partridge; and his wife, when she was servant to mr allworthy,
had in something offended mrs wilkins

n who could not practise
it, much less should we think it understood so by those who can
practise it, and do not.

“but though,” continued he, “there is, i am afraid, little merit in
these benefactions, there would, i must confess, be much pleasure in
them to a good mind, if it was not abated by one consideration. i
mean, that we are liable to be imposed upon, and to confer our
choicest favours often on the undeserving, as you must own was your
case in your bounty to that worthless fellow partridge: for two or
three such examples must greatly lessen the inward satisfaction which
a good man would otherwise find in generosity; nay, may even make him
timorous in bestowing, lest he should be guilty of supporting vice,
and encouraging the wicked; a crime of a very black dye, and for which
it will by no means be a sufficient excuse, that we have not actually
intended such an encouragement; unless we have used the utmost caution
in chusing the objects of our beneficence. a consideration which, i
 
 ___________________________
 
believe it
can ever have such effect on a truly benevolent mind. nothing less
than a persuasion of universal depravity can lock up the charity of a
good man; and this persuasion must lead him, i think, either into
atheism, or enthusiasm; but surely it is unfair to argue such
universal depravity from a few vicious individuals; nor was this, i
believe, ever done by a man, who, upon searching his own mind, found
one certain exception to the general rule.” he then concluded by
asking, “who that partridge was, whom he had called a worthless
fellow?”

“i mean,” said the captain, “partridge the barber, the schoolmaster,
what do you call him? partridge, the father of the little child which
you found in your bed.”

mr allworthy exprest great surprize at this account, and the captain
as great at his ignorance of it; for he said he had known it above a
month: and at length recollected with much difficulty that he was told
it by mrs wilkins.

upon this, wilkins was immediately summoned; who h

aving confirmed what
the captain had said, was by mr allworthy, by and with the captain’s
advice, dispatched to little baddington, to inform herself of the
truth of the fact: for the captain exprest great dislike at all hasty
proceedings in criminal matters, and said he would by no means have mr
allworthy take any resolution either to the prejudice of the child or
its father, before he was satisfied that the latter was guilty; for
though he had privately satisfied himself of this from one of
partridge’s neighbours, yet he was too generous to give any such
evidence to mr allworthy.



chapter vi.

the trial of partridge, the schoolmaster, for incontinency; the
evidence of his wife; a short reflection on the wisdom of our law;
with other grave matters, which those will like best who understand
them most.


it may be wondered that a story so well known, and which had furnished
so much matter of conversation, should never have been mentioned to mr
allworthy himself, who was perhaps the only pe

n: for though a few odd fellows will utter their own
sentiments in all places, yet much the greater part of mankind have
enough of the courtier to accommodate their conversation to the taste
and inclination of their superiors.

but to return to mrs wilkins, who, having executed her commission with
great dispatch, though at fifteen miles distance, brought back such a
confirmation of the schoolmaster’s guilt, that mr allworthy determined
to send for the criminal, and examine him _viva voce_. mr partridge,
therefore, was summoned to attend, in order to his defence (if he
could make any) against this accusation.

at the time appointed, before mr allworthy himself, at paradise-hall,
came as well the said partridge, with anne, his wife, as mrs wilkins
his accuser.

and now mr allworthy being seated in the chair of justice, mr
partridge was brought before him. having heard his accusation from the
mouth of mrs wilkins, he pleaded not guilty, making many vehement
protestations of his innocence.

mrs p
 
 ___________________________
 
husband’s confession of his guilt.

whether she had forgiven him or no, i will not venture to determine;
but it is certain she was an unwilling witness in this cause; and it
is probable from certain other reasons, would never have been brought
to depose as she did, had not mrs wilkins, with great art, fished all
out of her at her own house, and had she not indeed made promises, in
mr allworthy’s name, that the punishment of her husband should not be
such as might anywise affect his family.

partridge still persisted in asserting his innocence, though he
admitted he had made the above-mentioned confession; which he however
endeavoured to account for, by protesting that he was forced into it
by the continued importunity she used: who vowed, that, as she was
sure of his guilt, she would never leave tormenting him till he had
owned it; and faithfully promised, that, in such case, she would never
mention it to him more. hence, he said, he had been induced falsely to
confess himself guilty, thoug
 
 ___________________________
 
h he was innocent; and that he believed
he should have confest a murder from the same motive.

mrs partridge could not bear this imputation with patience; and having
no other remedy in the present place but tears, she called forth a
plentiful assistance from them, and then addressing herself to mr
allworthy, she said (or rather cried), “may it please your worship,
there never was any poor woman so injured as i am by that base man;
for this is not the only instance of his falsehood to me. no, may it
please your worship, he hath injured my bed many’s the good time and
often. i could have put up with

sure--and since he provokes me, i am ready, an’t please your worship,
to take my bodily oath that i found them a-bed together. what, you
have forgot, i suppose, when you beat me into a fit, and made the
blood run down my forehead, because i only civilly taxed you with
adultery! but i can prove it by all my neighbours. you have almost
broke my heart, you have, you have.”

here mr allworthy interrupted, and begged her to be pacified,
promising her that she should have justice; then turning to partridge,
who stood aghast, one half of his wits being hurried away by surprize
and the other half by fear, he said he was sorry to see there was so
wicked a man in the world. he assured him that his prevaricating and
lying backward and forward was a great aggravation of his guilt; for
which the only atonement he could make was by confession and
repentance. he exhorted him, therefore, to begin by immediately
confessing the fact, and not to persist in denying what was so plainly
proved against him even b
 
 ___________________________
 
y his own wife.

here, reader, i beg your patience a moment, while i make a just
compliment to the great wisdom and sagacity of our law, which refuses
to admit the evidence of a wife for or against her husband. this, says
a certain learned author, who, i believe, was never quoted before in
any but a law-book, would be the means of creating an eternal
dissension between them. it would, indeed, be the means of much
perjury, and of much whipping, fining, imprisoning, transporting, and
hanging.

partridge stood a while silent, till, being bid to speak, he said he
had already spoken the truth, and appealed to heaven for his
innocence, and lastly to the girl herself, whom he desired his worship
immediately to send for; for he was ignorant, or at least pretended to
be so, that she had left that part of the country.

mr allworthy, whose natural love of justice, joined to his coolness of
temper, made him always a most patient magistrate in hearing all the
witnesses which an accused person could produ
 
 ___________________________
 
ce in his defence, agreed
to defer his final determination of this matter till the arrival of
jenny, for whom he immediately dispatched a messenger; and then having
recommended peace between partridge and his wife (though he addressed
himself chiefly to the wrong person), he appointed them to attend
again the third day; for he had sent jenny a whole day’s journey from
his own house.

at the appointed time the parties all assembled, when the messenger
returning brought word, that jenny was not to be found; for that she
had left her habitation a few days before, in company with a
recruiting officer.

mr allworthy then declared that the evidence of such a slut as she
appeared to be would have
 
 ___________________________
 
 deserved no credit; but he said he could not
help thinking that, had she been present, and would have declared the
truth, she must have confirmed what so many circumstances, together
with his own confession, and the declaration of his wife that she had
caught her husband in the fact, did sufficiently prove. he therefore
once more exhorted partridge to confess; but he still avowing his
innocence, mr allworthy declared himself satisfied of his guilt, and
that he was too bad a man to receive any encouragement from him. he
therefore deprived him of his annuity, and recommended repentance to
him on account of another world, and industry to maintain himself and
his wife in this.

there were not, perhaps, many more unhappy persons than poor
partridge. he had lost the best part of his income by the evidence of
his wife, and yet was daily upbraide
 
 ___________________________
 
d by her for having, among other
things, been the occasion of depriving her of that benefit; but such
was his fortune, and he was obliged to submit to it.

though i called him poor partridge in the last paragraph, i would have
the reader rather impute that epithet to the compassion in my temper
than conceive it to be any declaration of his innocence. whether he
was innocent or not will perhaps appear hereafter; but if the historic
muse hath entrusted me with any secrets, i will by no means be guilty
of discovering them till she shall give me leave.

here therefore the reader must suspend his curiosity. certain it is
that, whatever was the truth of the case, there was evidence more 
 
 ___________________________
 
than
sufficient to convict him before allworthy; indeed, much less would
have satisfied a bench of justices on an order of bastardy; and yet,
notwithstanding the positiveness of mrs partridge, who would have
taken the sacrament upon the matter, there is a possibility that the
schoolmaster was entirely innocent: for though it appeared clear on
comparing the time when jenny departed from little baddington with
that of her delivery that she had there conceived this infant, yet it
by no means followed of necessity that partridge must have been its
father; for, to omit other particulars, there was in the same house a
lad near eighteen, between whom and jenny there had subsisted
sufficien
 
 ___________________________
 
t intimacy to found a reasonable suspicion; and yet, so blind
is jealousy, this circumstance never once entered into the head of the
enraged wife.

whether partridge repented or not, according to mr allworthy’s advice,
is not so apparent. certain it is that his wife repented heartily of
the evidence she had given against him: especially when she found mrs
deborah had deceived her, and refused to make any application to mr
allworthy on her behalf. she had, however, somewhat better success
with mrs blifil, who was, as the reader must have perceived, a much
better-tempered woman, and very kindly undertook to solicit her
brother to restore the annuity; in whi
 
 ___________________________
 
rs, that mercy consists
only in punishing offenders; yet he was as far from thinking that it
is proper to this excellent quality to pardon great criminals
wantonly, without any reason whatever. any doubtfulness of the fact,
or any circumstance of mitigation, was never disregarded: but the
petitions of an offender, or the intercessions of others, did not in
the least affect him. in a word, he never pardoned because the
offender himself, or his friends, were unwilling that he should be
punished.

partridge and his wife were therefore both obliged to submit to their
fate; which was indeed severe enough: for so far was he from doubling
his industry on the account of his lessened income, that he did in a
manner abandon himself to despair; and as he was by nature indolent,
that vice now increased upon him, by which means he lost the little
school he had; so that neither his wife nor himself would have had any
bread to eat, had not the charity of some good christian interposed,
and provided them with 
 
 ___________________________
 
veyed to them by an unknown hand, they
imagined, and so, i doubt not, will the reader, that mr allworthy
himself was their secret benefactor; who, though he would not openly
encourage vice, could yet privately relieve the distresses of the
vicious themselves, when these became too exquisite and
disproportionate to their demerit. in which light their wretchedness
appeared now to fortune herself; for she at length took pity on this
miserable couple, and considerably lessened the wretched state of
partridge, by putting a final end to that of his wife, who soon after
caught the small-pox, and died.

the justice which mr allworthy had executed on partridge at first met
with universal approbation; but no sooner had he felt its
consequences, than his neighbours began to relent, and to
compassionate his case; and presently after, to blame that as rigour
and severity which they before called justice. they now exclaimed
against punishing in cold blood, and sang forth the praises of mercy
and forgiveness.
 
 ___________________________
 


these cries were considerably increased by the death of mrs partridge,
which, though owing to the distemper above mentioned, which is no
consequence of poverty or distress, many were not ashamed to impute to
mr allworthy’s severity, or, as they now termed it, cruelty.

partridge having now lost his wife, his school, and his annuity, and
the unknown person having now discontinued the last-mentioned charity,
resolved to change the scene, and left the country, where he was in
danger of starving, with the universal compassion of all his
neighbours.

on the contrary, that gentleman grew every day fonder of little tommy,
as if he intended to counterbalance his severity to the father with
extraordinary fondness and affection towards the son.

this a good deal soured the captain’s temper, as did all the other
daily instances of mr allworthy’s generosity; for he looked on all
such largesses to be diminutions of his own wealth.

after the
fact: for the whole duck, and great part of the apples, were converted
to the use of the gamekeeper and his family; though, as jones alone
was discovered, the poor lad bore not only the whole smart, but the
whole blame; both which fell again to his lot on the following
occasion.

contiguous to mr allworthy’s estate was the manor of one of those
gentlemen who are called preservers of the game. this species of men,
from the great severity with which they revenge the death of a hare or
partridge, might be thought to cultivate the same superstition with
the bannians in india; many of whom, we are told, dedicate their whole
lives to the preservation and protection of certain animals; was it
not that our english bannians, while they preserve them from other
enemies, will most unmercifully slaughter whole horse-loads
themselves; so that they stand clearly acquitted of any such
heathenish superstition.

i have, indeed, a much better opinion of this kind of men than is
entertained by some, a

          _feras consumere nati,_

“born to consume the beasts of the field;” or, as it is commonly
called, the game; and none, i believe, will deny but that those
squires fulfil this end of their creation.

little jones went one day a shooting with the gamekeeper; when
happening to spring a covey of partridges near the border of that
manor over which fortune, to fulfil the wise purposes of nature, had
planted one of the game consumers, the birds flew into it, and were
marked (as it is called) by the two sportsmen, in some furze bushes,
about two or three hundred paces beyond mr allworthy’s dominions.

mr allworthy had given the fellow strict orders, on pain of forfeiting
his place, never to trespass on any of his neighbours; no more on
those who were less rigid in this matter than on the lord of t

his
manor. with regard to others, indeed, these orders had not been always
very scrupulously kept; but as the disposition of the gentleman with
whom the partridges had taken sanctuary was well known, the gamekeeper
had never yet attempted to invade his territories. nor had he done it
now, had not the younger sportsman, who was excessively eager to
pursue the flying game, over-persuaded him; but jones being very
importunate, the other, who was himself keen enough after the sport,
yielded to his persuasions, entered the manor, and shot one of the
partridges.

the gentleman himself was at that time on horse-back, at a little
distance from them; and hearing 
 
 ___________________________
 
the gun go off, he immediately made
towards the place, and discovered poor tom; for the gamekeeper had
leapt into the thickest part of the furze-brake, where he had happily
concealed himself.

the gentleman having searched the lad, and found the partridge upon
him, denounced great vengeance, swearing he would acquaint mr
allworthy. he was as good as his word: for he rode immediately to his
house, and complained of the trespass on his manor in as high terms
and as bitter language as if his house had been broken open, and the
most valuable furniture stole out of it. he added, that some other
person was in his company, though he could not discover him; for that
two guns had been discharged almost in the same instant. and, says he,
“we have found

only this partridge, but the lord knows what mischief
they have done.”

at his return home, tom was presently convened before mr allworthy. he
owned the fact, and alledged no other excuse but what was really true,
viz., that the covey was originally sprung in mr allworthy’s own

tom was then interrogated who was with him, which mr allworthy
declared he was resolved to know, acquainting the culprit with the
circumstance of the two guns, which had been deposed by the squire and
both his servants; but tom

; adding, “heaven forbid such naughty words
should ever come out of his mouth!”

tom, though against all form of law, rejoined in affirmance of the
words. upon which master blifil said, “it is no wonder. those who will
tell one fib, will hardly stick at another. if i had told my master
such a wicked fib as you have done, i should be ashamed to show my
face.”

“what fib, child?” cries thwackum pretty eagerly.

“why, he told you that nobody was with him a shooting when he killed
the partridge; but he knows” (here he burst into a flood of tears),
“yes, he knows, for he confessed it to me, that black george the
gamekeeper was there. nay, he said--yes you did--deny it if you can,
that you would not have confest the truth, though master had cut you
to pieces.”

at this the fire flashed from thwackum’s eyes, and he cried out in
triumph--“oh! ho! this is your mistaken notion of honour! this is the
boy who was not to be whipped again!” but mr allworthy, with a more
gentle aspec

stopt his words, had he needed
them; and thwackum, who, for reasons before-mentioned, durst not
venture at disobliging the lady, was almost choaked with indignation.
as to mr allworthy, he said, since the boy had been already punished
he would not deliver his sentiments on the occasion; and whether he
was or was not angry with the lad, i must leave to the reader’s own
conjecture.

soon after this, an action was brought against the gamekeeper by
squire western (the gentleman in whose manor the partridge was
killed), for depredations of the like kind. this was a most
unfortunate circumstance for the fellow, as it not only of itself
threatened his ruin, but actually prevented mr allworthy from
restoring him to his favour: for as that gentleman was walking out one
evening with master blifil and young jones, the latter slily drew him
to the habitation of black george; where the family of that poor
wretch, namely, his wife and children, were found in all the misery
with which cold, hunger, and nake

dea of virtue could inspire a human mind with the
generous thought of giving liberty? and i repeat to you again, if it
was a fit thing to be proud, i might claim the honour of having
infused that idea.”--

“and if pride was not forbidden,” said thwackum, “i might boast of
having taught him that duty which he himself assigned as his motive.”

“so between you both,” says the squire, “the young gentleman hath been
taught to rob my daughter of her bird. i find i must take care of my
partridge-mew. i shall have some virtuous religious man or other set
all my partridges at liberty.” then slapping a gentleman of the law,
who was present, on the back, he cried out, “what say you to this, mr
counsellor? is not this against law?”

the lawyer with great gravity delivered himself as follows:--

“if the case be put of a partridge, there can be no doubt but an
action would lie; for though this be _ferae naturae_, yet being
reclaimed, property vests: but being the case of a singing bir

er which really does great
honour to human nature, and is productive of the highest good to
society. but it was otherwise with sophia. she honoured tom jones, and
scorned master blifil, almost as soon as she knew the meaning of those
two words.

sophia had been absent upwards of three years with her aunt; during
all which time she had seldom seen either of these young gentlemen.
she dined, however, once, together with her aunt, at mr allworthy’s.
this was a few days after the adventure of the partridge, before
commemorated. sophia heard the whole story at table, where she said
nothing: nor indeed could her aunt get many words from her as she
returned home; but her maid, when undressing her, happening to say,
“well, miss, i suppose you have seen young master blifil to-day?” she
answered with much passion, “i hate the name of master blifil, as i do
whatever is base and treacherous: and i wonder mr allworthy would
suffer that old barbarous schoolmaster to punish a poor boy so cruelly

 gownd; some of my family would not have picked up
such rags in the street; but poor people are always trampled
upon.--the parish need not have been in such a fluster with molly. you
might have told them, child, your grandmother wore better things new
out of the shop.”

“well, but consider,” cried george, “what answer shall i make to
madam?”

“i don’t know what answer,” says she; “you are always bringing your
family into one quandary or other. do you remember when you shot the
partridge, the occasion of all our misfortunes? did not i advise you
never to go into squire western’s manor? did not i tell you many a
good year ago what would come of it? but you would have your own
headstrong ways; yes, you would, you villain.”

black george was, in the main, a peaceable kind of fellow, and nothing
choleric nor rash; yet did he bear about him something of what the
antients called the irascible, and which his wife, if she had been
endowed with much wisdom, would have feared. he had

what he had said to him on the occasion, and
he hoped he would not transgress again.” so that, as the days of
whipping were at an end, the tutor had no other vent but his own mouth
for his gall, the usual poor resource of impotent revenge.

but square, who was a less violent, was a much more artful man; and as
he hated jones more perhaps than thwackum himself did, so he contrived
to do him more mischief in the mind of mr allworthy.

the reader must remember the several little incidents of the
partridge, the horse, and the bible, which were recounted in the
second book. by all which jones had rather improved than injured the
affection which mr allworthy was inclined to entertain for him. the
same, i believe, must have happened to him with every other person who
hath any idea of friendship, generosity, and greatness of spirit, that
is to say, who hath any traces of goodness in his mind.

square himself was not unacquainted with the true impression which
those several instances of goodness had m

must begin by telling you, sir, that you yourself have
been the greatest enemy i ever had.” jones was a little startled at
this sudden declaration. “i your enemy, sir!” says he, with much
amazement, and some sternness in his look. “nay, be not angry,” said
benjamin, “for i promise you i am not. you are perfectly innocent of
having intended me any wrong; for you was then an infant: but i shall,
i believe, unriddle all this the moment i mention my name. did you
never hear, sir, of one partridge, who had the honour of being reputed
your father, and the misfortune of being ruined by that honour?” “i
have, indeed, heard of that partridge,” says jones, “and have always
believed myself to be his son.” “well, sir,” answered benjamin, “i am
that partridge; but i here absolve you from all filial duty, for i do
assure you, you are no son of mine.” “how!” replied jones, “and is it
possible that a false suspicion should have drawn all the ill
consequences upon you, with w

 extraordinary meeting, that you are born to make me amends
for all i have suffered on that account. besides, i dreamt, the night
before i saw you, that i stumbled over a stool without hurting myself;
which plainly showed me something good was towards me: and last night
i dreamt again, that i rode behind you on a milk-white mare, which is
a very excellent dream, and betokens much good fortune, which i am
resolved to pursue unless you have the cruelty to deny me.”

“i should be very glad, mr partridge,” answered jones, “to have it in
my power to make you amends for your sufferings on my account, though
at present i see no likelihood of it; however, i assure you i will
deny you nothing which is in my power to grant.”

“it is in your power sure enough,” replied benjamin; “for i desire
nothing more than leave to attend you in this expedition. nay, i have
so entirely set my heart upon it, that if you should refuse me, you
will kill both a barber and a surgeon in one breath.”

jones

 answered, smiling, that he should be very sorry to be the
occasion of so much mischief to the public. he then advanced many
prudential reasons, in order to dissuade benjamin (whom we shall
hereafter call partridge) from his purpose; but all were in vain.
partridge relied strongly on his dream of the milk-white mare.
“besides, sir,” says he, “i promise you i have as good an inclination
to the cause as any man can possibly have; and go i will, whether you
admit me to go in your company or not.”

jones, who was as much pleased with partridge as partridge could be
with him, and who had not consulted his own inclination but the good
of the other in desiring him to stay behind, when he found his friend
so resolute, at last gave his consent; but then re

collecting himself,
he said, “perhaps, mr partridge, you think i shall be able to support
you, but i really am not;” and then taking out his purse, he told out
nine guineas, which he declared were his whole fortune.

partridge answered, “that his dependence was only on his future
favour; for he was thoroughly convinced he would shortly have enough
in his power. at present, sir,” said he, “i believe i am rather the
richer man of the two; but all i have is at your service, and at your
disposal. i insist upon your taking the whole, and i beg only to
attend you in the quality of your servant; _nil desperandum est teucro
duce et auspice teucro_”: but to this generous proposal concerning the
money, jones would by n

it was resolved to set out the next morning, when a difficulty arose
concerning the baggage; for the portmanteau of mr jones was too large
to be carried without a horse.

“if i may presume to give my advice,” says partridge, “this
portmanteau, with everything in it, except a few shirts, should be
left behind. those i shall be easily able to carry for you, and the
rest of your cloaths will remain very safe locked up in my house.”

this method was no sooner proposed than agreed to; and then the barber
departed, in order to prepare everything for his intended expedition.

though partridge was one of the most superstitious of men, he would
hardly perhaps have desired to accompany jones on his expedition
merely from the omens of the joint-stool and white mare, if his
prospect had been no better than to have shared the plunder gained in
the field of battle. in fact, when partridge came to ruminate on the
relation he had heard from jones, he could not reconcile to himself
that mr allworthy should turn his son (for so he most firmly believed
him to be) out of doors, for any reason which he had heard assigned.
he concluded, therefore, that the whole was a fiction, and that jones,
of whom he had often from his correspondents heard the wildest
character, had in reality run away from his father. it came into his
head, therefore, that if he could prevail with the young gentlema

n to
return back to his father, he should by that means render a service to
allworthy, which would obliterate all his former anger; nay, indeed,
he conceived that very anger was counterfeited, and that allworthy had
sacrificed him to his own reputation. and this suspicion indeed he
well accounted for, from the tender behaviour of that excellent man to
the foundling child; from his great severity to partridge, who,
knowing himself to be innocent, could not conceive that any other
should think him guilty; lastly, from the allowance which he had
privately received long after the annuity had been publickly taken
from him, and which he looked upon as a kind of smart-money, or rather
by way of atonement for injustice; for it is very uncommon, i believe,
for men to ascribe the benefactions they receive to pure charity, when
they can possibly impute them to any other motive. if he could by any
means theref

ore persuade the young gentleman to return home, he
doubted not but that he should again be received into the favour of
allworthy, and well rewarded for his pains; nay, and should be again
restored to his native country; a restoration which ulysses himself
never wished more heartily than poor partridge.

as for jones, he was well satisfied with the truth of what the other
had asserted, and believed that partridge had no other inducements but
love to him, and zeal for the cause; a blameable want of caution and
diffidence in the veracity of others, in which he was highly worthy of
censure. to say the truth, there are but two ways by which men become
possessed of this excellent quality. the one is from long experience,
and the other is from nature; which last, i presume, is often meant by
genius, or great natural parts; and it is infinitely the better of the
two, not only as we are masters of it much earli

hearing; for having lighted his pipe, he staggered off as fast as he
could. we shall therefore transcribe no more of her speech, as it
approached still nearer and nearer to a subject too indelicate to find
any place in this history.

early in the morning partridge appeared at the bedside of jones, ready
equipped for the journey, with his knapsack at his back. this was his
own workmanship; for besides his other trades, he was no indifferent
taylor. he had already put up his whole stock of linen in it,
consisting of four shirts, to which he now added eight for mr jones;
and then packing up the portmanteau, he was departing with it towards
his own house, but was stopt in his way by the landlady, who refused
to suffer any removals till after the payment of t

 the grand mysteries of their trade. the first is, if they
have anything good in their house (which indeed very seldom happens)
to produce it only to persons who travel with great equipages. 2dly,
to charge the same for the very worst provisions, as if they were the
best. and lastly, if any of their guests call but for little, to make
them pay a double price for everything they have; so that the amount
by the head may be much the same.

the bill being made and discharged, jones set forward with partridge,
carrying his knapsack; nor did the landlady condescend to wish him a
good journey; for this was, it seems, an inn frequented by people of
fashion; and i know not whence it is, but all those who get their
livelihood by people of fashion, contract as much insolence to the
rest of mankind, as if they really belonged to that rank themselves.

and partridge, or little benjamin (which epithet of little
was perhaps given him ironically, he being in reality near six feet

being arrived here, they chose for their house of entertainment the
sign of the bell, an excellent house indeed, and which i do most
seriously recommend to every reader who shall visit this antient city.

as mrs whitefield had no reason to suspect that the petty-fogger had
any motive or temptation to abuse jones, the reader cannot blame her
for believing what he so confidently affirmed with many oaths. she
accordingly gave up her skill in physiognomy, and hence-forwards
conceived so ill an opinion of her guest, that she heartily wished him
out of her house.

this dislike was now farther increased by a report which mr whitefield
made from the kitchen, where partridge had informed the company, “that
though he carried the knapsack, and contented himself with staying
among servants, while tom jones (as he called him) was regaling in the
parlour, he was not his servant, but only a friend and companion, and
as good a gentleman as mr jones himself.”

dowling sat all this while silent, biting his fingers, making faces,
grinning, and looking wonderfully arch; at last he opened his lips,
and protested that the gentleman looked like another sort of man. he

those who neglect and slight him; but ought rather to despise such as
affect his conversation, unless where a perfect intimacy must have
convinced them that their friend’s character hath been falsely and
injuriously aspersed.

this was not, however, the case of jones; for as he was a perfect
stranger to the truth, so he was with good reason offended at the
treatment he received. he therefore paid his reckoning and departed,
highly against the will of mr partridge, who having remonstrated much
against it to no purpose, at last condescended to take up his knapsack
and to attend his friend.

mid-winter) the dirty fingers of night would have drawn her sable
curtain over the universe, had not the moon forbid her, who now, with
a face as broad and as red as those of some jolly mortals, who, like
her, turn night into day, began to rise from her bed, where she had
slumbered away the day, in order to sit up all night. jones had not
travelled far before he paid his compliments to that beautiful planet,
and, turning to his companion, asked him if he had ever beheld so
delicious an evening? partridge making no ready answer to his
question, he proceeded to comment on the beauty of the moon, and
repeated some passages from milton, who hath certainly excelled all
other poets in his description of the heavenly luminaries. he then
told partridge the story from the spectator, of two lovers who had
agreed to entertain themselves when they were at a great distance from
each other, by repairing, at a certain fixed hour, to look at the
moon; thus pleasing themselves with the thought that they were bo

employed in contemplating the same object at the same time. “those
lovers,” added he, “must have had souls truly capable of feeling all
the tenderness of the sublimest of all human passions.”--“very
probably,” cries partridge: “but i envy them more, if they had bodies
incapable of feeling cold; for i am almost frozen to death, and am
very much afraid i shall lose a piece of my nose before we get to
another house of entertainment. nay, truly, we may well expect some
judgment should happen to us for our folly in running away so by night
from one of the most excellent inns i ever set my foot into. i am sure
i never saw more good things in my life, and the greatest lord in the
land cannot live better in his own house

than he may there. and to
forsake such a house, and go a rambling about the country, the lord
knows whither, _per devia rura viarum_, i say nothing for my part; but
some people might not have charity enough to conclude we were in our
sober senses.”--“fie upon it, mr partridge!” says jones, “have a
better heart; consider you are going to face an enemy; and are you
afraid of facing a little cold? i wish, indeed, we had a guide to
advise which of these roads we should take.”--“may i be so bold,” says
partridge, “to offer my advice? _interdum stultus opportuna
loquitur_”--“why, which of them,” cries jones, “would you
recommend?”--“truly neither of them,” answered partridge. “the only
road we can be certain of finding, is the road we came. a g

 least fifty miles before me, and no house in all the
way.”--“you see, indeed, a very fair prospect,” says jones, “which
receives great additional beauty from the extreme lustre of the moon.
however, i will keep the left-hand track, as that seems to lead
directly to those hills, which we were informed lie not far from
worcester. and here, if you are inclined to quit me, you may, and
return back again; but for my part, i am resolved to go forward.”

“it is unkind in you, sir,” says partridge, “to suspect me of any such
intention. what i have advised hath been as much on your account as on
my own: but since you are determined to go on, i am as much determined
to follow. _i prae sequar te_.”

they now travelled some miles without speaking to each other, during
which suspense of discourse jones often sighed, and benjamin groaned
as bitterly, though from a very different reason. at length jones made
a full stop, and turning about, cries, “who knows, partridge, but the

very moon which i behold at this instant?” “very likely, sir,”
 answered partridge; “and if my eyes were fixed on a good surloin of
roast beef, the devil might take the moon and her horns into the
bargain.” “did ever tramontane make such an answer?” cries jones.
“prithee, partridge, wast thou ever susceptible of love in thy life,
or hath time worn away all the traces of it from thy memory?”
 “alack-a-day!” cries partridge, “well would it have been for me if i
had never known what love was. _infandum regina jubes renovare
dolorem_. i am sure i have tasted all the tenderness, and sublimities,
and bitternesses of the passion.” “was your mistress unkind, then?”
 says jones. “very unkind, indeed, sir,” answered partridge; “for she
married me, and made one of the most confounded wives in the world.
however, heaven be praised, she’s gone; and if i believed she was in
the moon, according to a book i once

 read, which teaches that to be
the receptacle of departed spirits, i would never look at it for fear
of seeing her; but i wish, sir, that the moon was a looking-glass for
your sake, and that miss sophia western was now placed before it.” “my
dear partridge,” cries jones, “what a thought was there! a thought
which i am certain could never have entered into any mind but that of
a lover. o partridge! could i hope once again to see that face; but,
alas! all those golden dreams are vanished for ever, and my only
refuge from future misery is to forget the object of all my former
happiness.” “and do you really despair of ever seeing miss western
again?” answered partridge; “if you will follow my advice i will
engage you shall not only see her but have her in your arms.” “ha! do
not awaken a thought of that nature,” cries jones: “i have struggled
sufficiently to conquer all such

 wishes already.” “nay,” answered
partridge, “if you do not wish to have your mistress in your arms you
are a most extraordinary lover indeed.” “well, well,” says jones, “let
us avoid this subject; but pray what is your advice?” “to give it you
in the military phrase, then,” says partridge, “as we are soldiers,
`to the right about.’ let us return the way we came; we may yet reach
gloucester to-night, though late; whereas, if we proceed, we are
likely, for aught i see, to ramble about for ever without coming
either to house or home.” “i have already told you my resolution is to
go on,” answered jones; “but i would have you go back. i am obliged to
you for your company hither; and i beg you to accept a guinea as a
small instance of my gratitude. nay, it would be cruel i

you to go any farther; for, to deal plainly with you, my chief end and
desire is a glorious death in the service of my king and country.” “as

will receive none of you at this time; for at present i am, i believe,
the richer man of the two. and as your resolution is to go on, so mine
is to follow you if you do. nay, now my presence appears absolutely
necessary to take care of you, since your intentions are so desperate;

to fall in battle if you can, so i am resolved as firmly to come to no

sured me the catholicks did not expect to be any gainers by the
change; for that prince charles was as good a protestant as any in
england; and that nothing but regard to right made him and the rest of
the popish party to be jacobites.”--“i believe him to be as much a
protestant as i believe he hath any right,” says jones; “and i make no
doubt of our success, but not without a battle. so that i am not so
sanguine as your friend the popish priest.” “nay, to be sure, sir,”
 answered partridge, “all the prophecies i have ever read speak of a
great deal of blood to be spilt in the quarrel, and the miller with
three thumbs, who is now alive, is to hold the horses of three kings,
up to his knees in blood. lord, have mercy upon us all, and send
better times!” “with what stuff and nonsense hast thou filled thy
head!” answered jones: “this too, i suppose, comes from the popish
priest. monsters and prodigies are the proper arguments to support
monstrous and absurd doctrines. the c

ause of king george is the cause
of liberty and true religion. in other words, it is the cause of
common sense, my boy, and i warrant you will succeed, though briarius
himself was to rise again with his hundred thumbs, and to turn
miller.” partridge made no reply to this. he was, indeed, cast into
the utmost confusion by this declaration of jones. for, to inform the
reader of a secret, which he had no proper opportunity of revealing
before, partridge was in truth a jacobite, and had concluded that
jones was of the same party, and was now proceeding to join the
rebels. an opinion which was not without foundation. for the tall,
long-sided dame, mentioned by hudibras--that many-eyed, many-tongued,
many-mouthed, many-eared monster of virgil, had related the story of
the quarrel between jones and the officer, with the usual regard to
truth. she had, indeed, changed the name of sophia into that of the
pretender, and had reported, that drinking hi

for which jones was knocked down. this partridge had heard, and most
firmly believed. ‘tis no wonder, therefore, that he had thence
entertained the above-mentioned opinion of jones; and which he had
almost discovered to him before he found out his own mistake. and at
this the reader will be the less inclined to wonder, if he pleases to
recollect the doubtful phrase in which jones first communicated his
resolution to mr partridge; and, indeed, had the words been less
ambiguous, partridge might very well have construed them as he did;
being persuaded as he was that the whole nation were of the same
inclination in their hearts; nor did it stagger him that jones had
travelled in the company of soldiers; for he had the same opinion of
the army which he had of the rest of the people.

but however well affected he might be to james or charles, he was
still much more attached to little benjamin than to either; for which
reason

ooner discovered the principles of his fellow-traveller
than he thought proper to conceal and outwardly give up his own to the
man on whom he depended for the making his fortune, since he by no
means believed the affairs of jones to be so desperate as they really
were with mr allworthy; for as he had kept a constant correspondence
with some of his neighbours since he left that country, he had heard
much, indeed more than was true, of the great affection mr allworthy
bore this young man, who, as partridge had been instructed, was to be
that gentleman’s heir, and whom, as we have said, he did not in the
least doubt to be his son.

he imagined therefore that whatever quarrel was between them, it would
be certainly made up at the return of mr jones; an event from which he
promised great advantages, if he could take this opportunity of
ingratiating himself with that young gentleman; and if he could by any
means be instrumental in procuring his return, he doubted not, as we
have before said, but it

chapter x.

in which our travellers meet with a very extraordinary adventure.


just as jones and his friend came to the end of their dialogue in the
preceding chapter, they arrived at the bottom of a very steep hill.
here jones stopt short, and directing his eyes upwards, stood for a
while silent. at length he called to his companion, and said,
“partridge, i wish i was at the top of this hill; it must certainly
afford a most charming prospect, especially by this light; for the
solemn gloom which the moon casts on all objects, is beyond expression
beautiful, especially to an imagination which is desirous of
cultivating melancholy ideas.”--“very probably,” answered partridge;
“but if the top of the hill be properest to produce melancholy
thoughts, i suppose the bottom is the likeliest to produce merry ones,
and these i take to be much the 
 
 ___________________________
 
better of the two. i protest you have
made my blood run cold with the very mentioning the top of that
mountain; which seems to me to be one of the highest in the world. no,
no, if we look for anything, let it be for a place under ground, to
screen ourselves from the frost.”--“do so,” said jones; “let it be but
within hearing of this place, and i will hallow to you at my return
back.”--“surely, sir, you are not mad,” said partridge.--“indeed, i
am,” answered jones, “if ascending this hill be madness; but as you
complain so much of the cold already, i would have you stay below. i
will certainly return to you within an hour.”--“pardon me, sir,” cries
partridge; “i have determined to follow you wherever you go.” indeed
he was now afraid to stay behind; for though he was coward enough in
all respects, yet his chief fear was that of ghosts, with which the
present time of night, and the wildness of the place, ex

tremely well
suited.

at this instant partridge espied a glimmering light through some
trees, which seemed very near to them. he immediately cried out in a
rapture, “oh, sir! heaven hath at last heard my prayers, and hath
brought us to a house; perhaps it may be an inn. let me beseech you,
sir, if you have any compassion either for me or yourself, do not

to persons in our miserable condition.” jones at length yielded to the
earnest supplications of partridge, and both together made directly
towards the place whence the light issued.

they soon arrived at the door of this house, or cottage, for it might
be called either, without much impropriety. here jones knocked several
times without receiving any answer from within; at which partridge,
whose head was full of nothing but of ghosts, devils, witches, and
such like, began to tremble, crying, “lord, have mercy upon us! surely
the people must be all dead. i can see no light neither now, and yet i
am certain i saw a candle burning but a moment before.--well! i have
heard of such things.”--“what hast thou heard of?” said jones. “the
people are either fast asleep, or probably, as this is a lonely place,
are afraid to open their door.” he then began to vociferate pretty
lo

udly, and at last an old woman, opening an upper casement, asked,
who they were, and what they wanted? jones answered, they were
travellers who had lost their way, and having seen a light in the
window, had been led thither in hopes of finding some fire to warm
themselves. “whoever you are,” cries the woman, “you have no business
here; nor shall i open the door to any one at this time of night.”
 partridge, whom the sound of a human voice had recovered from his
fright, fell to the most earnest supplications to be admitted for a
few minutes to the fire, saying, he was almost dead with the cold; to
which fear had indeed contributed equally with the frost. he assured
her that the gentleman who spoke to her was one of the greatest
squires in the country; and made use of every argument, save one,
which jones afterwards effectually added; and this was, the promise of
half-a-crown;--a bribe too great to

 be resisted by such a person,
especially as the genteel appearance of jones, which the light of the
moon plainly discovered to her, together with his affable behaviour,
had entirely subdued those apprehensions of thieves which she had at
first conceived. she agreed, therefore, at last, to let them in; where
partridge, to his infinite joy, found a good fire ready for his
reception.

the poor fellow, however, had no sooner warmed himself, than those
thoughts which were always uppermost in his mind, began a little to
disturb his brain. there was no article of his creed in which he had a
stronger faith than he had in witchcraft, nor can the reader conceive
a figure more adapted to inspire this idea, than the old woman who now
stood before him. she answered exactly to that picture drawn by otway
in his orphan. i

ndeed, if this woman had lived in the reign of james
the first, her appearance alone would have hanged her, almost without
any evidence.

many circumstances likewise conspired to confirm partridge in his
opinion. her living, as he then imagined, by herself in so lonely a
place; and in a house, the outside of which seemed much too good for
her, but its inside was furnished in the most neat and elegant manner.
to say the truth, jones himself was not a little surprized at what he
saw; for, besides the extraordinary neatness of the room, it was
adorned with a great number of nicknacks and curiosities, which might
have engaged the attention of a virtuoso.

while jones was admiring these thing

s, and partridge sat trembling
with the firm belief that he was in the house of a witch, the old
woman said, “i hope, gentlemen, you will make what haste you can; for
i expect my master presently, and i would not for double the money he
should find you here.”--“then you have a master?” cried jones.
“indeed, you will excuse me, good woman, but i was surprized to see
all those fine things in your house.”--“ah, sir,” said she, “if the
twentieth part of these things were mine, i should think mysel

he is a strange man, not at all like other people. he keeps no
company with anybody, and seldom walks out but by night, for he doth
not care to be seen; and all the country people are as much afraid of
meeting him; for his dress is enough to frighten those who are not
used to it. they call him, the man of the hill (for there he walks by
night), and the country people are not, i believe, more afraid of the
devil himself. he would be terribly angry if he found you
here.”--“pray, sir,” says partridge, “don’t let us offend the
gentleman; i am ready to walk, and was never warmer in my life. do
pray, sir, let us go. here are pistols over the chimney: who knows
whether they be charged or no, or what he may do with them?”--“fear
nothing, partridge,” cries jones; “i will secure thee from
danger.”--“nay, for matter o’ that, he never doth any mischief,” said
the woman; “but to be sure it is necessary he should keep some arms
for his own safety; for his house hath been beset mo

”--“i should imagine,
by this collection of rarities,” cries jones, “that your master had
been a traveller.”--“yes, sir,” answered she, “he hath been a very
great one: there be few gentlemen that know more of all matters than
he. i fancy he hath been crost in love, or whatever it is i know not;
but i have lived with him above these thirty years, and in all that
time he hath hardly spoke to six living people.” she then again
solicited their departure, in which she was backed by partridge; but
jones purposely protracted the time, for his curiosity was greatly
raised to see this extraordinary person. though the old woman,
therefore, concluded every one of her answers with desiring him to be
gone, and partridge proceeded so far as to pull him by the sleeve, he
still continued to invent new questions, till the old woman, with an
affrighted countenance, declared she heard her master’s signal; and at
the same instant more than one voice was heard without the door,
crying, “d--n y

 jones, “to that providence to which you owe
your deliverance: as to my part, i have only discharged the common
duties of humanity, and what i would have done for any fellow-creature
in your situation.”--“let me look at you a little longer,” cries the
old gentleman. “you are a human creature then? well, perhaps you are.
come pray walk into my little hutt. you have been my deliverer
indeed.”

the old woman was distracted between the fears which she had of her
master, and for him; and partridge was, if possible, in a greater
fright. the former of these, however, when she heard her master speak
kindly to jones, and perceived what had happened, came again to
herself; but partridge no sooner saw the gentleman, than the
strangeness of his dress infused greater terrors into that poor fellow
than he had before felt, either from the strange description which he
had heard, or from the uproar which had happened at the door.

to say the truth, it was an appearance which might have affected a

tallest size, with a long beard as white as snow. his body was
cloathed with the skin of an ass, made something into the form of a
coat. he wore likewise boots on his legs, and a cap on his head, both
composed of the skin of some other animals.

as soon as the old gentleman came into his house, the old woman began
her congratulations on his happy escape from the ruffians. “yes,”
 cried he, “i have escaped, indeed, thanks to my preserver.”--“o the

avoids society itself. however, without a compliment to you, you do
not appear to me one of those whom i should shun or detest; nay, i
must say, in what little hath dropt from you, there appears some
parity in our fortunes: i hope, however, yours will conclude more
successfully.”

here some compliments passed between our heroe and his host, and then
the latter was going to begin his history, when partridge interrupted
him. his apprehensions had now pretty well left him, but some effects
of his terrors remained; he therefore reminded the gentleman of that
excellent brandy which he had mentioned. this was presently brought,
and partridge swallowed a large bumper.

the gentleman then, without any farther preface, began as you may read
in the next chapter.



chapter xi.

in which the man of the hill begins to relate his history.


“i was born in a village of somersetshire, called mark, in the year

ndustrious,
and so good a husbandman, that he might have led a very easy and
comfortable life, had not an arrant vixen of a wife soured his
domestic quiet. but though this circumstance perhaps made him
miserable, it did not make him poor; for he confined her almost
entirely at home, and rather chose to bear eternal upbraidings in his
own house, than to injure his fortune by indulging her in the
extravagancies she desired abroad.

“by this xanthippe” (so was the wife of socrates called, said
partridge)--“by this xanthippe he had two sons, of which i was the
younger. he designed to give us both good education; but my elder
brother, who, unhappily for him, was the favourite of my mother,
utterly neglected his learning; insomuch that, after having been five
or six years at school with little or no improvement, my father, being
told by his master that it would be to no purpose to keep him longer
there, at last complied with my mother in taking him home from the
hands of that tyrant, as she cal

led his master; though indeed he gave
the lad much less correction than his idleness deserved, but much
more, it seems, than the young gentleman liked, who constantly
complained to his mother of his severe treatment, and she as
constantly gave him a hearing.”

“yes, yes,” cries partridge, “i have seen such mothers; i have been
abused myself by them, and very unjustly; such parents deserve
correction as much as their children.”

jones chid the pedagogue for his interruption, and then the stranger
proceeded.

“my brother now, at the age of fifteen, bade adieu to all learning,
and to everything else but to his dog and gun; with which latter he
became so expert, that, though perhaps you may think it incredible, he
could not only hit a standing mark with great certainty, but h

wickedness which i did not meditate, in order for my
relief. self-murder itself became the subject of my serious
deliberation; and i had certainly resolved on it, had not a more
shameful, though perhaps less sinful, thought expelled it from my
head.”--here he hesitated a moment, and then cried out, “i protest, so
many years have not washed away the shame of this act, and i shall
blush while i relate it.” jones desired him to pass over anything that
might give him pain in the relation; but partridge eagerly cried out,
“oh, pray, sir, let us hear this; i had rather hear this than all the
rest; as i hope to be saved, i will never mention a word of it.” jones
was going to rebuke him, but the stranger prevented it by proceeding
thus: “i had a chum, a very prudent, frugal young lad, who, though he
had no very large allowance, had by his parsimony heaped up upwards of
forty guineas, which i knew he kept in his escritore. i took therefore
an opportunity of purloining his key from his breech

obtained a warrant against one who had now so bad a character through
the whole university.

“luckily for me, i lay out of the college the next evening; for that
day i attended a young lady in a chaise to witney, where we staid all
night, and in our return, the next morning, to oxford, i met one of my
cronies, who acquainted me with sufficient news concerning myself to
make me turn my horse another way.”

“pray, sir, did he mention anything of the warrant?” said partridge.
but jones begged the gentleman to proceed without regarding any
impertinent questions; which he did as follows:--

“having now abandoned all thoughts of returning to oxford, the next
thing which offered itself was a journey to london. i imparted this
intention to my female companion, who at first remonstrated against
it; but upon producing my wealth, she immediately consented. we then
struck across the country, into the great cirencester road, and made
such haste, that we spent the next even

red itself to my choice unattended by shame.

“the time of the assizes soon came, and i was removed by habeas corpus
to oxford, where i expected certain conviction and condemnation; but,
to my great surprize, none appeared against me, and i was, at the end
of the sessions, discharged for want of prosecution. in short, my chum
had left oxford, and whether from indolence, or from what other motive
i am ignorant, had declined concerning himself any farther in the
affair.”

“perhaps,” cries partridge, “he did not care to have your blood upon
his hands; and he was in the right on’t. if any person was to be
hanged upon my evidence, i should never be able to lie alone
afterwards, for fear of seeing his ghost.”

“i shall shortly doubt, partridge,” says jones, “whether thou art more
brave or wise.”--“you may laugh at me, sir, if you please,” answered
partridge; “but if you will hear a very short story which i can tell,
and which is most certainly true, perhaps you may change

your opinion.
in the parish where i was born--” here jones would have silenced him;
but the stranger interceded that he might be permitted to tell his
story, and in the meantime promised to recollect the remainder of his
own.

partridge then proceeded thus: “in the parish where i was born, there
lived a farmer whose name was bridle, and he had a son named francis,
a good hopeful young fellow: i was at the grammar-school with him,
where i remember he was got into ovid’s epistles, and he could
construe you three lines together sometimes without looking into a
dictionary. besides all this, he was a very good lad, never missed
church o’ sundays, and was reckoned one of the best psalm-singers in
the whole parish. he would ind

eed now and then take a cup too much,
and that was the only fault he had.”--“well, but come to the ghost,”
 cries jones. “never fear, sir; i shall come to him soon enough,”
 answered partridge. “you must know, then, that farmer bridle lost a
mare, a sorrel one, to the best of my remembrance; and so it fell out
that this young francis shortly afterward being at a fair at hindon,
and as i think it was on--, i can’t remember the day; and being as he
was, what should he happen to meet but a man upon his father’s mare.
frank called out presently, stop thief; and it being in the middle of
the fair, it was impossible, you know, for the man to make his escape.
so they apprehended him a

for above half-an-hour. i thought it hard, i own, that there should be
so many of them; my lord, and the court, and the jury, and the
counsellors, and the witnesses, all upon one poor man, and he too in
chains. well, the fellow was hanged, as to be sure it could be no
otherwise, and poor frank could never be easy about it. he never was
in the dark alone, but he fancied he saw the fellow’s spirit.”--“well,
and is this thy story?” cries jones. “no, no,” answered partridge. “o
lord have mercy upon me! i am just now coming to the matter; for one
night, coming from the alehouse, in a long, narrow, dark lane, there
he ran directly up against him; and the spirit was all in white, and
fell upon frank; and frank, who was a sturdy lad, fell upon the spirit
again, and there they had a tussel together, and poor frank was
dreadfully beat: indeed he made a shift at last to crawl home; but
what with the beating, and what with the fright, he lay ill above a
fortnight; and a

will bear witness to it.”

the stranger smiled at this story, and jones burst into a loud fit of
laughter; upon which partridge cried, “ay, you may laugh, sir; and so
did some others, particularly a squire, who is thought to be no better
than an atheist; who, forsooth, because there was a calf with a white
face found dead in the same lane the next morning, would fain have it
that the battle was between frank and that, as if a calf would set
upon a man. besides, frank told me he knew it to be a spirit, and
could swear to him in any court in christendom; and he had not drank
above a quart or two or such a matter of liqu

or, at the time. lud have
mercy upon us, and keep us all from dipping our hands in blood, i
say!”

“well, sir,” said jones to the stranger, “mr partridge hath finished
his story, and i hope will give you no future interruption, if you
will be so kind to proceed.” he then resumed his narration; but as he
hath taken breath for a while, we think proper to give it to our
reader, and shall therefore put an end to this chapter.

in which the man of the hill continues his history.


“i had now regained my liberty,” said the stranger; “but i had lost my

“it was at present my fortune to be destitute of that great evil, as
it is apprehended to be by several writers, who i suppose were
overburthened with it, namely, money.”--“with submission, sir,” said
partridge, “i do not remember any writers who have called it
_malorum_; but _irritamenta malorum_. _effodiuntur opes, irritamenta
malorum_”--“well, sir,” continued the stranger, “whether it be an
evil, or only the cause of evil, i was entirely void of it, and at the
same time of friends, and, as i thought, of acquaintance; when one
evening, as i was passing through the inner temple, very hungry, and
very miserable, i heard a voice on a sudden hailing me with great

. here, when we arrived at the tavern, mr watson
applied himself to the drawer only, without taking the least notice of
the cook; for he had no suspicion but that i had dined long since.
however, as the case was really otherwise, i forged another falsehood,
and told my companion i had been at the further end of the city on
business of consequence, and had snapt up a mutton-chop in haste; so
that i was again hungry, and wished he would add a beef-steak to his
bottle.”--“some people,” cries partridge, “ought to have good
memories; or did you find just money enough in your breeches to pay
for the mutton-chop?”--“your observation is right,” answered the
stranger, “and i believe such blunders are inseparable from all
dealing in untruth.--but to proceed--i began now to feel myself
extremely happy. the meat and wine soon revived my spirits to a high
pitch, and i enjoyed much pleasure in the conversation of my old
acquaintance, the rather as i thought him entirely ignorant of what

some dice out of his pocket, `here’s the stuff. here are the
implements; here are the little doctors which cure the distempers of

the pocket of a queer cull without any danger of the nubbing cheat.’”

“nubbing cheat!” cries partridge: “pray, sir, what is that?”

“why that, sir,” says the stranger, “is a cant phrase for the gallows;
for as gamesters differ little from highwaymen in their morals, so do
they very much resemble them in their language.

“we had now each drank our bottle, when mr watson said, the board was
sitting, and that he must attend, earnestly pressing me at the same
time to go with him and try my fortune. i answered he knew that was at
present out of my power, as i had informed him of the empti

pocket. to say the truth, i doubted not from his many strong
expressions of friendship, but that he would offer to lend me a small
sum for that purpose, but he answered, `never mind that, man; e’en
boldly run a levant’ [partridge was going to inquire the meaning of
that word, but jones stopped his mouth]: `but be circumspect as to the
man. i will tip you the proper person, which may be necessary, as you
do not know the town, nor can distinguish a rum cull from a queer
one.”

“the bill was now brought, when watson paid his share, and was
departing. i reminded him, not without blushing, of my having no
money. he answered, `that signifies nothing; score it behind the door,
or make a bold brush and take no notice.--or--

vern play; for the
money by degrees totally disappeared; so that though at the beginning
the table was half covered with gold, yet before the play ended, which
it did not till the next day, being sunday, at noon, there was scarce
a single guinea to be seen on the table; and this was the stranger as
every person present, except myself, declared he had lost; and what
was become of the money, unless the devil himself carried it away, is
difficult to determine.”

“most certainly he did,” says partridge, “for evil spirits can carry
away anything without being seen, though there were never so many folk
in the room; and i should not have been surprized if he had carried
away all the company of a set of wicked wretches, who were at play in
sermon time. and i could tell you a true story, if i would, where the
devil took a man out of bed from another man’s wife, and carried him
away through the keyhole of the door. i’ve seen the very house where
it was done, and nobody hath lived in it these

thirty years.”

though jones was a little offended by the impertinence of partridge,
he could not however avoid smiling at his simplicity. the stranger did
the same, and then proceeded with his story, as will be seen in the
next chapter.



chapter xiii.

in which the foregoing story is farther continued.


“my fellow-collegiate had now entered me in a new scene of life. i

that philosophy makes us wiser, but christianity makes us better men.
philosophy elevates and steels the mind, christianity softens and
sweetens it. the former makes us the objects of human admiration, the
latter of divine love. that insures us a temporal, but this an eternal
happiness.--but i am afraid i tire you with my rhapsody.”

“not at all,” cries partridge; “lud forbid we should be tired with
good things!”

“i had spent,” continued the stranger, “about four years in the most
delightful manner to myself, totally given up to contemplation, and
entirely unembarrassed with the affairs of the world, when i lost the
best of fathers, and one whom i so entirely loved, that my grief at
his loss exceeds all description. i now abandoned my books, and gave
myself up for a whole month to the effects of melancholy and despair.

 continued the stranger, “betook myself again to my former studies,
which i may say perfected my cure; for philosophy and religion may be
called the exercises of the mind, and when this is disordered, they
are as wholesome as exercise can be to a distempered body. they do
indeed produce similar effects with exercise; for they strengthen and
confirm the mind, till man becomes, in the noble strain of horace--

could, the cause of his having attempted so desperate an act, and to
prevent, as far as i was able, his pursuing such wicked intentions for
the future. i was no sooner admitted into his chamber, than we both
instantly knew each other; for who should this person be but my good
friend mr watson! here i will not trouble you with what past at our
first interview; for i would avoid prolixity as much as
possible.”--“pray let us hear all,” cries partridge; “i want mightily
to know what brought him to bath.”

“you shall hear everything material,” answered the stranger; and then
proceeded to relate what we shall proceed to write, after we have
given a short breathing time to both ourselves and the reader.



chapter xiv.

in which the man of the hill concludes his history.


“mr watson,” continued the stranger, “very freely acquainted me, that
the unhappy situation of his circumstances, occasioned by a tide of
ill luck, had in a mann

 acquainted with as myself. i escaped, together with mr watson,
from the battle at sedgemore, in which action i received a slight
wound. we rode near forty miles together on the exeter road, and then
abandoning our horses, scrambled as well as we could through the
fields and bye-roads, till we arrived at a little wild hut on a
common, where a poor old woman took all the care of us she could, and
dressed my wound with salve, which quickly healed it.”

“pray, sir, where was the wound?” says partridge. the stranger
satisfied him it was in his arm, and then continued his narrative.
“here, sir,” said he, “mr watson left me the next morning, in order,
as he pretended, to get us some provision from the town of collumpton;
but--can i relate it, or can you believe it?--this mr watson, this
friend, this base, barbarous, treacherous villain, betrayed me to a
party of horse belonging to king james, and at his return delivered me
into their hands.

you have already spent: but you will give me leave to wish for some
further opportunity of hearing the excellent observations which a man
of your sense and knowledge of the world must have made in so long a
course of travels.”--“indeed, young gentleman,” answered the stranger,
“i will endeavour to satisfy your curiosity on this head likewise, as
far as i am able.” jones attempted fresh apologies, but was prevented;
and while he and partridge sat with greedy and impatient ears, the
stranger proceeded as in the next chapter.


  [*] _the rest of this paragraph and the two following paragraphs
  in the first edition were as follows_:

  “for my own part, i had been for some time very seriously affected

however,” said he, “it is now a most lovely morning, and if you can
bear any longer to be without your own rest or food, i will gladly
entertain you with the sight of some very fine prospects which i
believe you have not yet seen.”

jones very readily embraced this offer, and they immediately set
forward together from the cottage. as for partridge, he had fallen
into a profound repose just as the stranger had finished his story;
for his curiosity was satisfied, and the subsequent discourse was not
forcible enough in its operation to conjure down the charms of sleep.
jones therefore left him to enjoy his nap; and as the reader may
perhaps be at this season glad of the same favour, we will here put an
end to the eighth book of our history.

 attended the issue.

jones then stepping without the wood, perceived the old man sitting as
we have just described him; he presently exerted his utmost agility,
and with surprizing expedition ascended the hill.

the old man advised him to carry the woman to upton, which, he said,
was the nearest town, and there he would be sure of furnishing her
with all manner of conveniencies. jones having received his direction
to the place, took his leave of the man of the hill, and, desiring him
to direct partridge the same way, returned hastily to the wood.

our heroe, at his departure to make this enquiry of his friend, had
considered, that as the ruffian’s hands were tied behind him, he was
incapable of executing any wicked purposes on the poor woman. besides,
he knew he should not be beyond the reach of her voice, and could
return soon enough to prevent any mischief. he had moreover declared
to the villain, that if he attempted the least insult, he would be
himself immediately the executioner of ven

he shoulders.

it is a question whether the landlord or the landlady was the most
expeditious in returning this blow. my landlord, whose hands were
empty, fell to with his fist, and the good wife, uplifting her broom
and aiming at the head of jones, had probably put an immediate end to
the fray, and to jones likewise, had not the descent of this broom
been prevented--not by the miraculous intervention of any heathen
deity, but by a very natural though fortunate accident, viz., by the
arrival of partridge; who entered the house at that instant (for fear
had caused him to run every step from the hill), and who, seeing the
danger which threatened his master or companion (which you chuse to
call him), prevented so sad a catastrophe, by catching hold of the
landlady’s arm, as it was brandished aloft in the air.

the landlady soon perceived the impediment which prevented her blow;
and being unable to rescue her arm from the hands of partridge, she
let fall the broom; and then leaving jones to the d

iscipline of her
husband, she fell with the utmost fury on that poor fellow, who had
already given some intimation of himself, by crying, “zounds! do you
intend to kill my friend?”

partridge, though not much addicted to battle, would not however stand
still when his friend was attacked; nor was he much displeased with
that part of the combat which fell to his share; he therefore returned
my landlady’s blows as soon as he received them: and now the fight was
obstinately maintained on all parts, and it seemed doubtful to which
side fortune would incline, when the naked lady, who had listened at
the top of the stairs to the dialogue which preceded the engagement,
descended suddenly

inequality of two to one, fell upon the poor woman who was boxing with
partridge; nor did that great champion desist, but rather redoubled
his fury, when he found fresh succours were arrived to his assistance.

victory must now have fallen to the side of the travellers (for the
bravest troops must yield to numbers) had not susan the chambermaid
come luckily to support her mistress. this susan was as two-handed a
wench (according to the phrase) as any in the country, and would, i
believe, have beat the famed thalestris herself, or any of her subject
amazons; for her form was

ived in them, and moreover they were so hard, that a
fist could hardly make any impression on them. lastly, her cheek-bones
stood out, as if nature had intended them for two bastions to defend
her eyes in those encounters for which she seemed so well calculated,
and to which she was most wonderfully well inclined.

this fair creature entering the field of battle, immediately filed to
that wing where her mistress maintained so unequal a fight with one of
either sex. here she presently challenged partridge to single combat.
he accepted the challenge, and a most desperate fight began between
them.

now the dogs of war being let loose, began to lick their bloody lips;
now victory, with golden wings, hung hovering in the air; now fortune,
taking her scales from her shelf, began to weigh the fates of tom
jones, his female companion, and partridge, against the landlord, his
wife, and maid; all which hung in exact balance before her; when a
good-natured accident put suddenly an end to the bloody fray,

with
which half of the combatants had already sufficiently feasted. this
accident was the arrival of a coach and four; upon which my landlord
and landlady immediately desisted from fighting, and at their entreaty
obtained the same favour of their antagonists: but susan was not so
kind to partridge; for that amazonian fair having overthrown and
bestrid her enemy, was now cuffing him lustily with both her hands,
without any regard to his request of a cessation of arms, or to those
loud exclamations of murder which he roared forth.

no sooner, however, had jones quitted the landlord, than he flew to
the rescue of his defeated companion, from whom he with much
difficulty drew off the enraged chambermaid: but partridge was not
immediately sensible of his deliverance, for he still lay flat on

jones had at first deposited his fair prize, as it was the best
apartment in the house. hither they were obliged to pass through the
field of battle, which they did with the utmost haste, covering their
faces with their handkerchiefs, as desirous to avoid the notice of any
one. indeed their caution was quite unnecessary; for the poor
unfortunate helen, the fatal cause of all the bloodshed, was entirely
taken up in endeavouring to conceal her own face, and jones was no
less occupied in rescuing partridge from the fury of susan; which
being happily effected, the poor fellow immediately departed to the
pump to wash his face, and to stop that bloody torrent which susan had
plentifully set a-flowing from his nostrils.

in which the arrival of a man of war puts a final end to hostilities,

woman, in order to apparel herself in a decent manner.

my landlord was likewise beginning his oration to jones, but was
presently interrupted by that generous youth, who shook him heartily
by the hand, and assured him of entire forgiveness, saying, “if you
are satisfied, my worthy friend, i promise you i am;” and indeed, in
one sense, the landlord had the better reason to be satisfied; for he
had received a bellyfull of drubbing, whereas jones had scarce felt a
single blow.

partridge, who had been all this time washing his bloody nose at the
pump, returned into the kitchen at the instant when his master and the
landlord were shaking hands with each other. as he was of a peaceable
disposition, he was pleased with those symptoms of reconciliation; and
though his face bore some marks of susan’s fist, and many more of her
nails, he rather chose to be contented with his fortune in the last
battle than to endeavour at bettering it in another.

the heroic susan was likewise well

 contented with her victory, though
it had cost her a black eye, which partridge had given her at the
first onset. between these two, therefore, a league was struck, and
those hands which had been the instruments of war became now the
mediators of peace.

matters were thus restored to a perfect calm; at which the serjeant,
though it may seem so contrary to the principles of his profession,
testified his approbation. “why now, that’s friendly,” said he; “d--n
me, i hate to see two people bear ill-will to one another after they

ent company poured the liquor only down their
throats; and, secondly, the serjeant, who officiated as priest, drank
the last; but he preserved, i believe, the antient form, in swallowing
much the largest draught of the whole company, and in being the only
person present who contributed nothing towards the libation besides
his good offices in assisting at the performance.

the good people now ranged themselves round the kitchen fire, where
good humour seemed to maintain an absolute dominion; and partridge not
only forgot his shameful defeat, but converted hunger into thirst, and
soon became extremely facetious. we must however quit this agreeable
assembly for a while, and attend mr jones to mrs waters’s apartment,
where the dinner which he had bespoke was now on the table. indeed, it
took no long time in preparing, having been all drest three days
before, and required nothing more from the cook than to warm it over
again.



chapter v.

an apology for all heroes who have good stomachs, with a 
 
 ___________________________
 
h not very friendly, conclusion.


while our lovers were entertaining themselves in the manner which is
partly described in the foregoing chapter, they were likewise
furnishing out an entertainment for their good friends in the kitchen.
and this in a double sense, by affording them matter for their
conversation, and, at the same time, drink to enliven their spirits.

there were now assembled round the kitchen fire, besides my landlord
and landlady, who occasionally went backward and forward, mr
partridge, the serjeant, and the coachman who drove the young lady and
her maid.

partridge having acquainted the company with what he had learnt from
the man of the hill concerning the situation in which mrs waters had
been found by jones, the serjeant proceeded to that part of her
history which was known to him. he said she was the wife of mr waters,
who was a captain in their regiment, and had often been with him at
quarters. “some folks,” says he, “used indeed to doubt whether they
were lawfull

at our last
quarters; that is the very right and truth of the matter. but the
captain he knows nothing about it; and as long as there is enough for
him too, what does it signify? he loves her not a bit the worse, and i
am certain would run any man through the body that was to abuse her;
therefore i won’t abuse her, for my part. i only repeat what other
folks say; and, to be certain, what everybody says, there must be some
truth in.”--“ay, ay, a great deal of truth, i warrant you,” cries
partridge; “_veritas odium parit_”--“all a parcel of scandalous
stuff,” answered the mistress of the house. “i am sure, now she is
drest, she looks like a very good sort of lady, and she behaves
herself like one; for she gave me a guinea for the use of my
cloaths.”--“a very good lady indeed!” cries the landlord; “and if you
had not been a little too hasty, you would not have quarrelled with
her as you did at first.”--“you need mention that with my truly!”
 answered she: “if it h

hereafter?
this is not the first time i have suffered for your numscull’s pate. i
wish you would always hold your tongue in the house, and meddle only
in matters without doors, which concern you. don’t you remember what
happened about seven years ago?”--“nay, my dear,” returned he, “don’t
rip up old stories. come, come, all’s well, and i am sorry for what i
have done.” the landlady was going to reply, but was prevented by the
peace-making serjeant, sorely to the displeasure of partridge, who was
a great lover of what is called fun, and a great promoter of those
harmless quarrels which tend rather to the production of comical than
tragical incidents.

the serjeant asked partridge whither he and his master were travelling?
“none of your magisters,” answered partridge; “i am no man’s servant, i
assure you; for, though i have had misfortunes in the world, i write
gentleman after my name; and, as poor and simple as i may appear now, i
have taught grammar-school in my time; 
 
 ___________________________
 
_sed hei mihi! non sum quod
fui_.”--“no offence, i hope, sir,” said the serjeant; “where, then, if
i may venture to be so bold, may you and your friend be
travelling?”--“you have now denominated us right,” says partridge.
“_amici sumus._ and i promise you my friend is one of the greatest
gentlemen in the kingdom” (at which words both landlord and landlady
pricked up their ears). “he is the heir of squire allworthy.”--“what,
the squire who doth so much good all over the country?” cries my
landlady. “even he,” answered partridge.--“then i warrant,” says she,
“he’ll have a swinging great estate hereafter.”--“most certainly,”
 answered partridge.--“well,” replied the landlady, “i

 thought the first
moment i saw him he looked like a good sort of gentleman; but my
husband here, to be sure, is wiser than anybody.”--“i own, my dear,”
 cries he, “it was a mistake.”--“a mistake, indeed!” answered she; “but
when did you ever know me to make such mistakes?”--“but how comes it,
sir,” cries the landlord, “that such a great gentleman walks about the
country afoot?”--“i don’t know,” returned partridge; “great gentlemen
have humours sometimes. he hath now a dozen horses and servants at
gloucester; and nothing would serve him, but last night, it being very
hot weather, he must cool himself with a walk to yon high hill, whither
i likewise walked with him to bear him company; but if ever you catch
me there again: for i was never so frightened in all my life. we met
with the strangest man there.”--“i’ll be hanged,” cries the landlord,
“if it was not the man of the hill, as they call h

im; if indeed he be a
man; but i know several people who believe it is the devil that lives
there.”--“nay, nay, like enough,” says partridge; “and now you put me
in the head of it, i verily and sincerely believe it was the devil,
though i could not perceive his cloven foot: but perhaps he might have
the power given him to hide that, since evil spirits can appear in what
shapes they please.”--“and pray, sir,” says the serjeant, “no offence,
i hope; but pray what sort of a gentleman is the devil? for i have
heard some of our officers say there is no such person; and that it is
only a trick of the parsons, to prevent their be

ing broke; for, if it
was publickly known that there was no devil, the parsons would be of no
more use than we are in time of peace.”--“those officers,” says
partridge, “are very great scholars, i suppose.”--“not much of
schollards neither,” answered the serjeant; “they have not half your
learning, sir, i believe; and, to be sure, i thought there must be a
devil, notwithstanding what they said, though one of them was a
captain; for methought, thinks i to myself, if there be no devil, how
can wicked people be sent to him? and i have read all that upon a
book.”--“some of your officers,” quoth the landlord, “will find there

 “i have suffered enough
by them.”--“bear witness, gentlemen,” says the serjeant, “he curses the
king, and that’s high treason.”--“i curse the king! you villain,” said
the landlord. “yes, you did,” cries the serjeant; “you cursed the
cloth, and that’s cursing the king. it’s all one and the same; for
every man who curses the cloth would curse the king if he durst; so for
matter o’ that, it’s all one and the same thing.”--“excuse me there, mr
serjeant,” quoth partridge, “that’s a _non sequitur_.”--“none of your
outlandish linguo,” answered the serjeant, leaping from his seat; “i
will not sit still and hear the cloth abused.”--“you mistake me,
friend,” cries partridge. “i did not mean to abuse the cloth; i only
said your conclusion was a _non sequitur_.[*]”--“you
are another,” cries the serjeant,” an you come to that. no more a
_sequitur_ than yourself. you are a pack of rascals, and i’ll prove it;
for i will fight the best man of

 you all for twenty pound.” this
challenge effectually silenced partridge, whose stomach for drubbing
did not so soon return after the hearty meal which he had lately been
treated with; but the coachman, whose bones were less sore, and whose
appetite for fighting was somewhat sharper, did not so easily brook the
affront, of which he conceived some part at least fell to his share. he
started therefore from his seat, and, advancing to the serjeant, swore
he looked on himself to be as good a man as any in the army, and
offered to box for a guinea. the military man accep

the young lady was now desirous to depart, and had given orders for
her coach to be prepared; but all in vain, for the coachman was
disabled from performing his office for that evening. an antient
heathen would perhaps have imputed this disability to the god of
drink, no less than to the god of war; for, in reality, both the
combatants had sacrificed as well to the former deity as to the
latter. to speak plainly, they were both dead drunk, nor was partridge
in a much better situation. as for my landlord, drinking was his
trade; and the liquor had no more effect on him than it had on any
other vessel in his house.

the mistress of the inn, being summoned to attend mr jones and his
companion at their tea, gave a full relation of the latter part of the
foregoing scene; and at the same time expressed great concern for the
young lady, “who,” she said, “was under the utmost uneasiness at being
prevented from pursuing her journey. she is a sweet pr

ielded to the dissuasions of his friend from searching any farther
after her that night, and accepted the kind offer of part of his bed.

the footman and post-boy were in a different disposition. they were
more ready to order than the landlady was to provide; however, after
being pretty well satisfied by them of the real truth of the case, and
that mr fitzpatrick was no thief, she was at length prevailed on to
set some cold meat before them, which they were devouring with great
greediness, when partridge came into the kitchen. he had been first
awaked by the hurry which we have before seen; and while he was
endeavouring to compose himself again on his pillow, a screech-owl had
given him such a serenade at his window, that he leapt in a most
horrible affright from his bed, and, huddling on his cloaths with
great expedition, ran down to the protection of the company, whom he
heard talking below in the kitchen.

his arrival detained my landlady from returning to her rest; for she
was just about to
 
 ___________________________
 
 leave the other two guests to the care of susan; but
the friend of young squire allworthy was not to be so neglected,
especially as he called for a pint of wine to be mulled. she
immediately obeyed, by putting the same quantity of perry to the fire;
for this readily answered to the name of every kind of wine.

the irish footman was retired to bed, and the post-boy was going to
follow; but partridge invited him to stay and partake of his wine,
which the lad very thankfully accepted. the schoolmaster was indeed
afraid to return to bed by himself; and as he did not know how soon he
might lose the company of my landlady, he was resolved to secure that
of the boy, in whose presence he apprehended no danger from the devil
or any of his adherents.

and now arrived another post-boy at the gate; upon which susan, being
ordered out, returned, introducing two young women in riding habits,
one of whi

ch was so very richly laced, that partridge and the post-boy
instantly started from their chairs, and my landlady fell to her
courtsies, and her ladyships, with great eagerness.

the lady in the rich habit said, with a smile of great condescension,
“if you will give me leave, madam, i will warm myself a few minutes at
your kitchen fire, for it is really very cold; but i must insist on
disturbing no one from his seat.” this was spoken on account of
partridge, who had retreated to the other end of the room, struck with
the utmost awe and astonishment at the splendor of the lady’s dress.
indeed, she had a much better title to respect than this; for she was
one of the most beautiful creatures in the world.

the lady earnestly desired partridge to return to his seat; but could
not prevail. she then pulled off her gloves, and displayed to the fire
two hands, which had every property of snow in them, except that of
melting. her companion, who was indee

other, “i have several very good rooms for that matter, but none good
enough for your honour’s ladyship. however, as you are so
condescending to take up with the best i have, do, susan, get a fire
in the rose this minute. will your ladyship be pleased to go up now,
or stay till the fire is lighted?” “i think i have sufficiently warmed
myself,” answered the lady; “so, if you please, i will go now; i am
afraid i have kept people, and particularly that gentleman (meaning
partridge), too long in the cold already. indeed, i cannot bear to
think of keeping any person from the fire this dreadful weather.”--she
then departed with her maid, the landlady marching with two lighted
candles before her.

when that good woman returned, the conversation in the kitchen was all
upon the charms of the young lady. there is indeed in perfect beauty a
power which none almost can withstand; for my landlady, though she was
not pleased at the negative given to the supper, declared she had
n

ever seen so lovely a creature. partridge ran out into the most
extravagant encomiums on her face, though he could not refrain from
paying some compliments to the gold lace on her habit; the post-boy
sung forth the praises of her goodness, which were likewise echoed by
the other post-boy, who was now come in. “she’s a true good lady, i
warrant her,” says he; “for she hath mercy upon dumb creatures; for
she asked me every now and tan upon the journey, if i did not think
she should hurt the horses by riding too fast? and when she

not ordered a fire in the parlour; but, she said, that was now too
late. “however,” said she, “i have novelty to recommend a kitchen; for
i do not believe i ever eat in one before.” then, turning to the
post-boys, she asked them, “why they were not in the stable with their
horses? if i must eat my hard fare here, madam,” cries she to the
landlady, “i beg the kitchen may be kept clear, that i may not be
surrounded with all the blackguards in town: as for you, sir,” says
she to partridge, “you look somewhat like a gentleman, and may sit
still if you please; i don’t desire to disturb anybody but mob.”

“yes, yes, madam,” cries partridge, “i am a gentleman, i do assure
you, and i am not so easily to be disturbed. _non semper vox casualis
est verbo nominativus_.” this latin she took to be some affront, and
answered, “you may be a gentleman, sir; but you don’t show yourself as
one to talk latin to a woman.” partridge made a gentle reply, and
concluded with more

te a person; and, while a second course of the same was by
her order preparing, she said, “and so, madam, you tell me your house
is frequented by people of great quality?”

the landlady answered in the affirmative, saying, “there were a great
many very good quality and gentlefolks in it now. there’s young squire
allworthy, as that gentleman there knows.”

“and pray who is this young gentleman of quality, this young squire
allworthy?” said abigail.

“who should he be,” answered partridge, “but the son and heir of the
great squire allworthy, of somersetshire!”

“upon my word,” said she, “you tell me strange news; for i know mr
allworthy of somersetshire very well, and i know he hath no son
alive.”

the landlady pricked up her ears at this, and partridge looked a
little confounded. however, after a short hesitation, he answered,
“indeed, madam, it is true, everybody doth not know him to be squire
allworthy’s son; for he was never married to his mother; but his son
 
 ___________________________
 

he certainly is, and will be his heir too, as certainly as his name is
jones.” at that word, abigail let drop the bacon which she was
conveying to her mouth, and cried out, “you surprize me, sir! is it
possible mr jones should be now in the house?” “_quare non?_” answered
partridge, “it is possible, and it is certain.”

abigail now made haste to finish the remainder of her meal, and then
repaired back to her mistress, when the conversation passed which may
be read in the next chapter.

cannot be so fortunate.” her maid averred the fact, and was presently
detached by her mistress to order him to be called; for she said she
was resolved to see him immediately.

mrs honour had no sooner left the kitchen in the manner we have before
seen than the landlady fell severely upon her. the poor woman had
indeed been loading her heart with foul language for some time, and
now it scoured out of her mouth, as filth doth from a mud-cart, when
the board which confines it is removed. partridge likewise shovelled
in his share of calumny, and (what may surprize the reader) not only
bespattered the maid, but attempted to sully the lily-white character
of sophia herself. “never a barrel the better herring,” cries he,
“_noscitur a socio_, is a true saying. it must be confessed, indeed,
that the lady in the fine garments is the civiller of the two; but i
warrant neither of them are a bit better than they should be. a couple
of bath trulls, i’ll answer for them; your quality don’t

this time o’ night without servants.” “sbodlikins, and that’s true,”
 cries the landlady, “you have certainly hit upon the very matter; for
quality don’t come into a house without bespeaking a supper, whether
they eat or no.”

while they were thus discoursing, mrs honour returned and discharged
her commission, by bidding the landlady immediately wake mr jones, and
tell him a lady wanted to speak with him. the landlady referred her to
partridge, saying, “he was the squire’s friend: but, for her part, she
never called men-folks, especially gentlemen,” and then walked
sullenly out of the kitchen. honour applied herself to partridge; but
he refused, “for my friend,” cries he, “went to bed very late, and he
would be very angry to be disturbed so soon.” mrs honour insisted
still to have him called, saying, “she was sure, instead of being
angry, that he would be to the highest degree delighted when he knew
the occasion.”

another time, perhaps, he might,” cries partridge;
“but _non omnia possumus omnes_. one woman is enough at once for a
reasonable man.” “what do you mean by one woman, fellow?” cries
honour. “none of your fellow,” answered partridge. he then proceeded
to inform her plainly that jones was in bed with a wench, and made use
of an expression too indelicate to be here inserted; which so enraged
mrs honour, that she called him jackanapes, and returned in a violent
hurry to her mistress, whom she acquainted with the success of her
errand, and with the account she had received; which, if possible, she
exaggerated, being as angry with jones as if he had pronounced all the
words that came from the mouth of partridge. she discharged 
 
 ___________________________
 
dissipated by concern to enable
her to stop the torrent of her maid. at last, however, she interrupted
her, saying, “i never can believe this; some villain hath belied him.
you say you had it from his friend; but surely it is not the office of
a friend to betray such secrets.” “i suppose,” cries honour, “the
fellow is his pimp; for i never saw so ill-looked a villain. besides,
such profligate rakes as mr jones are never ashamed of these matters.”

to say the truth, this behaviour of partridge was a little
inexcusable; but he had not slept off the effect of the dose which he
swallowed the evening before; which had, in the morning, received the
addition of above a pint of wine, or indeed rather of malt spirits;
for the perry was by no means pure. now, that part of his head which
nature designed for the reservoir of drink being very shallow, a small
quantity of liquor overflowed it, and opened the sluices of his heart;
so that all the secrets there deposited run out. these sluices were

inned to it, she bribed the maid to convey
it into the empty bed of mr jones, in which, if he did not find it,
she charged her to take some method of conveying it before his eyes in
the morning.

then, having paid for what mrs honour had eaten, in which bill was
included an account for what she herself might have eaten, she mounted
her horse, and, once more assuring her companion that she was
perfectly easy, continued her journey.



chapter vi.

containing, among other things, the ingenuity of partridge, the
madness of jones, and the folly of fitzpatrick.


it was now past five in the morning, and other company began to rise
and come to the kitchen, among whom were the serjeant and the
coachman, who, being thoroughly reconciled, made a libation, or, in
the english phrase, drank a hearty cup together.

in this drinking nothing more remarkable happened than the behaviour
of partridge, who, when the serjeant drank a health to king george,
repeated only the word king; nor could he be brought to ut

ter more;
for though he was going to fight against his own cause, yet he could
not be prevailed upon to drink against it.

mr jones, being now returned to his own bed (but from whence he
returned we must beg to be excused from relating), summoned partridge
from this agreeable company, who, after a ceremonious preface, having
obtained leave to offer his advice, delivered himself as follows:--

“it is, sir, an old saying, and a true one, that a wise man may
sometimes learn counsel from a fool; i wish, therefore, i might be so
bold as to offer you my advice, which is to return home again, and
leave these _horrida bella_, these bloody wars, to fellows who are
contented to swallow gunpowder, because they have nothing else to eat.
now, everybody know
 
 ___________________________
 
s your honour wants for nothing at home; when
that’s the case, why should any man travel abroad?”

“partridge,” cries jones, “thou art certainly a coward; i wish,
therefore, thou wouldst return home thyself, and trouble me no more.”

“i ask your honour’s pardon,” cries partridge; “i spoke on your
account more than my own; for as to me, heaven knows my circumstances
are bad enough, and i am so far from being afraid, that i value a
pistol, or a blunderbuss, or any such thing, no more than a pop-gun.
every man must die once, and what signifies the manner how? besides,
perhaps i may come off with the loss only of an arm or a leg. i assure
you, sir, i was never less afraid in my life; and so, if your honour
is resolved to go on, i am resolved to follow you. but, in that c
 
 ___________________________
 
ase,
i wish i might give my opinion. to be sure, it is a scandalous way of
travelling, for a great gentleman like you to walk afoot. now here are
two or three good horses in the stable, which the landlord will
certainly make no scruple of trusting you with; but, if he should, i
can easily contrive to take them; and, let the worst come to the
worst, the king would certainly pardon you, as you are going to fight
in his cause.”

now, as the honesty of partridge was equal to his understanding, and
both dealt only in small matters, he would never have attempted a
roguery of this kind, had he not imagined it altogether safe; for he
was one of those who have more consideration of the gallows than of
the fitness of things; but, in reality, he thought he might have
committed this felony without any danger; for, besides that he doubted
not but the name of mr allworthy would sufficiently quiet the
landlord, he conceived they should be altogether safe, whateve

r turn
affairs might take; as jones, he imagined, would have friends enough
on one side, and as his friends would as well secure him on the other.

when mr jones found that partridge was in earnest in this proposal, he
very severely rebuked him, and that in such bitter terms, that the
other attempted to laugh it off, and presently turned the discourse to
other matters; saying, he believed they were then in a bawdy house,
and that he had with much ado prevented two wenches from disturbing
his honour in the middle of the night. “heyday!” says he, “i believe
they got into your chamber whether i would or no; for here lies the
muff of one of them on the ground.” indeed,

as jones returned to his
bed in the dark, he had never perceived the muff on the quilt, and, in
leaping into his bed, he had tumbled it on the floor. this partridge
now took up, and was going to put into his pocket, when jones desired
to see it. the muff was so very remarkable, that our heroe might
possibly have recollected it without the information annexed. but his
memory was not put to that hard office; for at the same instant he saw
and read the words sophia western upon the paper which was pinned to
it. his looks now grew frantic in a moment, and he eagerly cried out,
“oh heavens! how came this muff here?” “i know no more than your
honour,” cr

women who would have disturbed you, if i would have suffered them.”
 “where are they?” cries jones, jumping out of bed, and laying hold of
his cloaths. “many miles off, i believe, by this time,” said
partridge. and now jones, upon further enquiry, was sufficiently
assured that the bearer of this muff was no other than the lovely
sophia herself.

the behaviour of jones on this occasion, his thoughts, his looks, his
words, his actions, were such as beggar all description. after many
bitter execrations on partridge, and not fewer on himself, he ordered
the poor fellow, who was frightened out of his wits, to run down and
hire him horses at any rate; and a very few minutes afterwards, having
shuffled on h

is clothes, he hastened down-stairs to execute the orders
himself, which he had just before given.

but before we proceed to what passed on his arrival in the kitchen, it
will be necessary to recur to what had there happened since partridge
had first left it on his master’s summons.

the serjeant was just marched off with his party, when the two irish
gentlemen arose, and came downstairs; both complaining that they had
been so often waked by the noises in the inn, that they had never once
been able to close their eyes all night.

the coach which had brought the young lady and her maid, and which,
perhaps, the reader may have hitherto concluded was her own, was,
indeed, a returned coach belonging to mr king, of bath, one of the

ragement of so learned a coadjutor, and
upon the violent intercession of the squire, was at length prevailed
upon to seat himself in the chair of justice, where being placed, upon
viewing the muff which jones still held in his hand, and upon the
parson’s swearing it to be the property of mr western, he desired mr
fitzpatrick to draw up a commitment, which he said he would sign.

jones now desired to be heard, which was at last, with difficulty,
granted him. he then produced the evidence of mr partridge, as to the
finding it; but, what was still more, susan deposed that sophia
herself had delivered the muff to her, and had ordered her to convey
it into the chamber where mr jones had found it.

whether a natural love of justice, or the extraordinary comeliness of
jones, had wrought on susan to make the discovery, i will not
determine; but such were the effects of her evidence, that the
magistrate, throwing himself back in his chair, declared that the
matter was now altogether as clear on the si

 hearty curse, and, immediately
ordering his horses, departed in pursuit of his daughter, without
taking the least notice of his nephew fitzpatrick, or returning any
answer to his claim of kindred, notwithstanding all the obligations he
had just received from that gentleman. in the violence, moreover, of
his hurry, and of his passion, he luckily forgot to demand the muff of
jones: i say luckily; for he would have died on the spot rather than
have parted with it.

jones likewise, with his friend partridge, set forward the moment he
had paid his reckoning, in quest of his lovely sophia, whom he now
resolved never more to abandon the pursuit of. nor could he bring
himself even to take leave of mrs waters; of whom he detested the very
thoughts, as she had been, though not designedly, the occasion of his
missing the happiest interview with sophia, to whom he now vowed
eternal constancy.

as for mrs waters, she took the opportunity of the coach which was
going to bath; for which place she set out in

into the worcester road, within less than four hours arrived at that
very inn where we last saw her.

having thus traced our heroine very particularly back from her
departure, till her arrival at upton, we shall in a very few words
bring her father to the same place; who, having received the first
scent from the post-boy, who conducted his daughter to hambrook, very
easily traced her afterwards to gloucester; whence he pursued her to
upton, as he had learned mr jones had taken that route (for partridge,
to use the squire’s expression, left everywhere a strong scent behind
him), and he doubted not in the least but sophia travelled, or, as he
phrased it, ran, the same way. he used indeed a very coarse
expression, which need not be here inserted; as fox-hunters, who alone
will understand it, will easily suggest it to themselves.

 instead of towards her. he then
took leave of his brother sportsman, and expressing great joy that the
frost was broken (which might perhaps be no small motive to his
hastening home), set forwards, or rather backwards, for somersetshire;
but not before he had first despatched part of his retinue in quest of
his daughter, after whom he likewise sent a volley of the most bitter
execrations which he could invent.



chapter iii.

the departure of jones from upton, with what passed between him and
partridge on the road.


at length we are once more come to our heroe; and, to say truth, we
have been obliged to part with him so long, that, considering the
condition in which we left him, i apprehend many of our readers have
concluded we intended to abandon him for ever; he being at present in
that situation in which prudent people usually desist from enquiring
any farther after their friends, lest they should be shocked by
hearing such friends had hanged themselves.

but, in reality, if we have not a

ll the virtues, i will boldly say,
neither have we all the vices of a prudent character; and though it is
not easy to conceive circumstances much more miserable than those of
poor jones at present, we shall return to him, and attend upon him
with the same diligence as if he was wantoning in the brightest beams
of fortune.

mr jones, then, and his companion partridge, left the inn a few
minutes after the departure of squire western, and pursued the same
road on foot, for the hostler told them that no horses were by any
means to be at that time procured at upton. on they marched with heavy
hearts; for though their disquiet proceeded from very different
reasons, yet displeased they were both; and if jones sighed bitterly,
partridge grunted altogether as sadly at every step.

when they came to the cross-roads where the squire had stopt to take
counsel, jones s

topt likewise, and turning to partridge, asked his
opinion which track they should pursue. “ah, sir,” answered partridge,
“i wish your honour would follow my advice.” “why should i not?”
 replied jones; “for it is now indifferent to me whither i go, or what
becomes of me.” “my advice, then,” said partridge, “is, that you
immediately face about and return home; for who that hath such a home
to return to as your honour, would travel thus about the country like
a vagabond? i ask pardon, _sed vox ea sola reperta est_.”

“alas!” cries jones, “i have no home to return to;--but if my friend,
my father, would receive me, could i bear the country from which
sophia is flown? cruel sophia! cruel! no; let me blame myself!--no;
let me blame thee. d--nation seize thee--fool--blockhead! thou hast
undo
 
 ___________________________
 
ne me, and i will tear thy soul from thy body.”--at which words he
laid violent hands on the collar of poor partridge, and shook him more
heartily than an ague-fit, or his own fears had ever done before.

partridge fell trembling on his knees, and begged for mercy, vowing he
had meant no harm--when jones, after staring wildly on him for a
moment, quitted his hold, and discharged a rage on himself, that, had
it fallen on the other, would certainly have put an end to his being,
which indeed the very apprehension of it had almost effected.

we would bestow some pains here in minutely describing all the mad
pranks which jones played on this occasion, could we be well assured
that the reader would take the sam
 
 ___________________________
 
and have left many excellent descriptions
out of our work, which would otherwise have been in it. and this
suspicion, to be honest, arises, as is generally the case, from our
own wicked heart; for we have, ourselves, been very often most
horridly given to jumping, as we have run through the pages of
voluminous historians.

suffice it then simply to say, that jones, after having played the
part of a madman for many minutes, came, by degrees, to himself; which
no sooner happened, than, turning to partridge, he very earnestly
begged his pardon for the attack he had made on him in the violence of
his passion; but concluded, by desiring him never to mention his
return again; for he was resolved never to see that country any more.

partridge easily forgave, and faithfully promised to obey the
injunction now laid upon him. and then jones very briskly cried out,
“since it is absolutely impossible for me to pursue any farther the
steps of my angel--i will pursue those of glory. come on, my brave
lad, 
 
 ___________________________
 
now for the army:--it is a glorious cause, and i would willingly
sacrifice my life in it, even though it was worth my preserving.” and
so saying, he immediately struck into the different road from that
which the squire had taken, and, by mere chance, pursued the very same
through which sophia had before passed.

our travellers now marched a full mile, without speaking a syllable to
each other, though jones, indeed, muttered many things to himself. as
to partridge, he was profoundly silent; for he was not, perhaps,
perfectly recovered from his former fright; besides, he had
apprehensions of provoking his friend to a second fit of wrath,
especially as he now began to entertain a conceit, which may not,
perhaps, create any great wonder in the reader. in short, he began now
to suspect that jones was absolutely out of his senses.

at length, jones, being weary of soliloquy, addressed himself to his
companion, and blamed him for his taciturnity; for which the
 
 ___________________________
 
 poor man
very honestly accounted, from his fear of giving offence. and now this
fear being pretty well removed, by the most absolute promises of
indemnity, partridge again took the bridle from his tongue; which,
perhaps, rejoiced no less at regaining its liberty, than a young colt,
when the bridle is slipt from his neck, and he is turned loose into
the pastures.

as partridge was inhibited from that topic which would have first
suggested itself, he fell upon that which was next uppermost in his
mind, namely, the man of the hill. “certainly, sir,” says he, “that
could never be a man, who dresses himself and lives after such a
strange manner, and so unlike other folks. besides, his diet, as the
old woman told me, is chiefly upon herbs, which is a fitter food for a
horse than a christian: nay, landlord at upton says that the
neighbours thereabouts have very fearf

been some spirit, who, perhaps,
might be sent to forewarn us: and who knows but all that matter which
he told us, of his going to fight, and of his being taken prisoner,
and of the great danger he was in of being hanged, might be intended
as a warning to us, considering what we are going about? besides, i
dreamt of nothing all last night but of fighting; and methought the
blood ran out of my nose, as liquor out of a tap. indeed, sir,
_infandum, regina, jubes renovare dolorem_.”

“thy story, partridge,” answered jones, “is almost as ill applied as
thy latin. nothing can be more likely to happen than death to men who
go into battle. perhaps we shall both fall in it--and what then?”
 “what then?” replied partridge; “why then there is an end of us, is
there not? when i am gone, all is over with me. what matters the cause
to me, or who gets the victory, if i am killed? i shall never enjoy
any advantage from it. what are all the ringing of bells, and
bonfires, to one that is six foot 
 
 ___________________________
 
under ground? there will be an end
of poor partridge.” “and an end of poor partridge,” cries jones,
“there must be, one time or other. if you love latin, i will repeat
you some fine lines out of horace, which would inspire courage into a
coward.

     `_dulce et decorum est pro patria mori
     mors et fugacem persequitur virum
     nec parcit imbellis juventae
     poplitibus, timidoque tergo._’”

“i wish you would construe them,” cries partridge; “for horace is a
hard author, and i cannot understand as you repeat them.”

“i will repeat you a bad imitation, or rather paraphrase, of my own,”
 said jones; “for i am but an indifferent poet:

`who would not die in his dear country’s cause? since, if base fear
his dastard step withdraws, from death he cannot fly:--one common
grave receives, at last, the coward and the brave.’”

“that’s very certain,” cries partridge. “ay, sure, _mors omnibus
communis:_ but there is a

people do?
and, for my part, i understand nothing of it. i never fired off a gun
above ten times in my life; and then it was not charged with bullets.
and for the sword, i never learned to fence, and know nothing of the
matter. and then there are those cannons, which certainly it must be
thought the highest presumption to go in the way of; and nobody but a
madman--i ask pardon; upon my soul i meant no harm; i beg i may not
throw your honour into another passion.”

“be under no apprehension, partridge,” cries jones; “i am now so well
convinced of thy cowardice, that thou couldst not provoke me on any
account.” “your honour,” answered he, “may call me coward, or anything
else you please. if loving to sleep in a whole skin makes a man a
coward, _non immunes ab illis malis sumus_. i never read in my grammar
that a man can’t be a good man without fighting. _vir bonus est quis?
qui consulta patrum, qui leges juraque servat_. not a word of
fighting; and i am sure the scripture is so

much against it, that a
man shall never persuade me he is a good christian while he sheds
christian blood.”



chapter iv.

the adventure of a beggar-man.


just as partridge had uttered that good and pious doctrine, with which
the last chapter concluded, they arrived at another cross-way, when a
lame fellow in rags asked them for alms; upon which partridge gave him
a severe rebuke, saying, “every parish ought to keep their own poor.”
 jones then fell a-laughing, and asked partridge, “if he was not
ashamed, with so much charity in his mouth, to have no charity in his
heart. your religion,” says he, “serves you only for an excuse for
your faults, but is no incentive to your virtue. can any man who is
really a christian abstain from relieving one of his brethren in such
a miserable condition?” and at the same time, putting his hand in his
pocket, he gave the poor object a shilling.

“master,” cries the fellow, after thanking him, “i have a curious
thing here in

r own fair hand.
he no sooner read the name than he prest it close to his lips; nor
could he avoid falling into some very frantic raptures,
notwithstanding his company; but, perhaps, these very raptures made
him forget he was not alone.

while jones was kissing and mumbling the book, as if he had an
excellent brown buttered crust in his mouth or as if he had really
been a book-worm, or an author who had nothing to eat but his own
works, a piece of paper fell from its leaves to the ground, which
partridge took up, and delivered to jones, who presently perceived it
to be a bank-bill. it was, indeed, the very bill which western had
given his daughter the night before her departure; and a jew would
have jumped to purchase it at five shillings less than £100.

the eyes of partridge sparkled at this news, which jones now
proclaimed aloud; and so did (though with somewhat a different aspect)
those of the poor fellow who had found the book; and who (i hope from
a principle of honesty) had never opened
 
 ___________________________
 
ast as mr jones desired; for
his guide unfortunately happened to be lame, and could not possibly
travel faster than a mile an hour. as this place, therefore, was at
above three miles’ distance, though the fellow had said otherwise, the
reader need not be acquainted how long they were in walking it.

jones opened the book a hundred times during their walk, kissed it as
often, talked much to himself, and very little to his companions. at
all which the guide exprest some signs of astonishment to partridge;
who more than once shook his head, and cryed, poor gentleman! _orandum
est ut sit mens sana in corpore sano._

at length they arrived at the very spot where sophia unhappily dropt
the pocket-book, and where the fellow had as happily found it. here
jones offered to take leave of his guide, and to improve his pace; but
the fellow, in whom that violent surprize and joy which the first
receipt of the guinea had occasioned was now considerably abated, and
who had now had sufficient time to recollec

again all that she lost; and as for any farther gratuity, i really
cannot give it you at present; but let me know your name, and where
you live, and it is more than possible you may hereafter have further
reason to rejoice at this morning’s adventure.”

“i don’t know what you mean by venture,” cries the fellow; “it seems i
must venture whether you will return the lady her money or no; but i
hope your worship will consider--” “come, come,” said partridge, “tell
his honour your name, and where you may be found; i warrant you will
never repent having put the money into his hands.” the fellow, seeing
no hopes of recovering the possession of the pocket-book, at last
complied in giving in his name and place of abode, which jones writ
upon a piece of paper with the pencil of sophia; and then, placing the
paper in the same page where she had writ her name, he cried out,
“there, friend, you are the happiest man alive; i have joined your
name to t

hat of an angel.” “i don’t know anything about angels,”
 answered the fellow; “but i wish you would give me a little more
money, or else return me the pocket-book.” partridge now waxed wrath:
he called the poor cripple by several vile and opprobrious names, and
was absolutely proceeding to beat him, but jones would not suffer any
such thing: and now, telling the fellow he would certainly find some
opportunity of serving him, mr jones departed as fast as his heels
would carry him; and partridge, into whom the thoughts of the hundred
pound had infused new spirits, followed his leader; while the man, who
was obliged to stay behind, fell to cursing them both, as well as

 his
parents; “for had they,” says he, “sent me to charity-school to learn
to write and read and cast accounts, i should have known the value of
these matters as well as other people.”



chapter v.

containing more adventures which mr jones and his companion met on the
road.


our travellers now walked so fast, that they had very little time or
breath for conversation; jones meditating all the way on sophia, and
partridge on the bank-bill, which, though it gave him some pleasure,
caused him at the same time to repine at fortune, which, in all his
walks, had never given him such an opportunity of showing his honesty.
they had proceeded above three miles, when partridge, being unable any
longer to keep up with jones, called to him, and begged him a little
to slacken his pace: with this he was the more ready to comply, as he
had for some time lost the footsteps of the horses, which the thaw had
enabled him to trace

 for several miles, and he was now upon a wide
common, where were several roads.

he here therefore stopt to consider which of these roads he should
pursue; when on a sudden they heard the noise of a drum, that seemed
at no great distance. this sound presently alarmed the fears of
partridge, and he cried out, “lord have mercy upon us all; they are
certainly a coming!” “who is coming?” cries jones; for fear had long
since given place to softer ideas in his mind; and since his adventure
with the lame man, he had been totally intent on pursuing sophia,
without entertaining one thought of an enemy. “who?” cries partridge,
“why, the rebels: but why should i call them rebels? they may be very
honest gentlemen, for anything i know to the contrary. the devil take
him that af

ld it not be the wiser way to
creep into some of yonder bushes, till they are gone by? what can two
unarmed men do perhaps against fifty thousand? certainly nobody but a
madman; i hope your honour is not offended; but certainly no man who
hath _mens sana in corpore sano_----” here jones interrupted this
torrent of eloquence, which fear had inspired, saying, “that by the
drum he perceived they were near some town.” he then made directly
towards the place whence the noise proceeded, bidding partridge “take
courage, for that he would lead him into no danger;” and adding, “it
was impossible the rebels should be so near.”

partridge was a little comforted with this last assurance; and though
he would more gladly have gone the contrary way, he followed his
leader, his heart beating time, but not after the manner of heroes, to
the music of the drum, which ceased not till they had traversed the
common, and were come into a narrow lane.

and now partridge, who kept even pace with jones, di
 
 ___________________________
 
scovered something
painted flying in the air, a very few yards before him, which fancying
to be the colours of the enemy, he fell a bellowing, “oh lord, sir,
here they are; there is the crown and coffin. oh lord! i never saw
anything so terrible; and we are within gun-shot of them already.”

jones no sooner looked up, than he plainly perceived what it was which
partridge had thus mistaken. “partridge,” says he, “i fancy you will
be able to engage this whole army yourself; for by the colours i guess
what the drum was which we heard before, and which beats up for
recruits to a puppet-show.”

“a puppet-show!” answered partridge, with most eager transport. “and
is it really no more than that? i love a puppet-show of all the
pastimes upon earth. do, good sir, let us tarry and see it. besides, i
am quite famished to death; for it is now almost dark, and i have not
eat a morsel since t

hree o’clock in the morning.”

they now arrived at an inn, or indeed an ale-house, where jones was
prevailed upon to stop, the rather as he had no longer any assurance
of being in the road he desired. they walked both directly into the
kitchen, where jones began to enquire if no ladies had passed that way
in the morning, and partridge as eagerly examined into the state of
their provisions; and indeed his enquiry met with the better success;
for jones could not hear news of sophia; but partridge, to his great
satisfaction, found good reason to expect very shortly the agreeable
sight of an excellent smoaking dish of eggs and bacon.

in strong and healthy constitutions love hath a very different effect
from what it causes in the puny part of the species. in the latter it
generally destroys all that appetite which tends towards the
conservation of the individual; but in the former, though it often
induces forgetfulness, and a neglect of food, as well as of everything
else; yet place a goo
 
 ___________________________
 
d piece of well-powdered buttock before a hungry
lover, and he seldom fails very handsomely to play his part. thus it
happened in the present case; for though jones perhaps wanted a
prompter, and might have travelled much farther, had he been alone,
with an empty stomach; yet no sooner did he sit down to the bacon and
eggs, than he fell to as heartily and voraciously as partridge
himself.

before our travellers had finished their dinner, night came on, and as
the moon was now past the full, it was extremely dark. partridge
therefore prevailed on jones to stay and see the puppet-show, which
was just going to begin, and to which they were very eagerly invited
by the master of the said show, who declared that his figures were the
finest which the world had ever produced, and that they had given
great satisfaction to all the quality in every town in england.

the puppet-sho

 of the provoked husband; and it
was indeed a very grave and solemn entertainment, without any low wit
or humour, or jests; or, to do it no more than justice, without
anything which could provoke a laugh. the audience were all highly
pleased. a grave matron told the master she would bring her two
daughters the next night, as he did not show any stuff; and an
attorney’s clerk and an exciseman both declared, that the characters
of lord and lady townley were well preserved, and highly in nature.
partridge likewise concurred with this opinion.

the master was so highly elated with these encomiums, that he could
not refrain from adding some more of his own. he said, “the present
age was not improved in anything so much as in their puppet-shows;
which, by throwing out punch and his wife joan, and such idle
trumpery, were at last brought to be a rational entertainment. i
remember,” said he, “when i first took to the business, there was a
great deal of low stuff that did very well to make folks

ck must be, if, in the midst of a declamation on the great virtues
of his pills and powders, the corpse of one of his martyrs should be
brought forth, and deposited before the stage, as a testimony of his
skill.

instead, therefore, of answering my landlady, the puppet-show man ran
out to punish his merry andrew; and now the moon beginning to put
forth her silver light, as the poets call it (though she looked at
that time more like a piece of copper), jones called for his
reckoning, and ordered partridge, whom my landlady had just awaked
from a profound nap, to prepare for his journey; but partridge, having
lately carried two points, as my reader hath seen before, was
emboldened to attempt a third, which was to prevail with jones to take
up a lodging that evening in the house where he then was. he
introduced this with an affected surprize at the intention which mr
jones declared of removing; and, after urging many excellent arguments
against it, he at last insisted strongly that it could be to

-but, not to detain the reader with
what is common to every host and hostess, it is sufficient to tell him
jones was at last prevailed on to stay and refresh himself with a few
hours’ rest, which indeed he very much wanted; for he had hardly shut
his eyes since he had left the inn where the accident of the broken
head had happened.

as soon as jones had taken a resolution to proceed no farther that
night, he presently retired to rest, with his two bedfellows, the
pocket-book and the muff; but partridge, who at several times had
refreshed himself with several naps, was more inclined to eating than
to sleeping, and more to drinking than to either.

and now the storm which grace had raised being at an end, and my
landlady being again reconciled to the puppet-man, who on his side
forgave the indecent reflections which the good woman in her passion
had cast on his performances, a face of perfect peace and tranquillity
reigned in the kitchen; where sat assembled round the fire the
landlord and land

lady of the house, the master of the puppet-show, the
attorney’s clerk, the exciseman, and the ingenious mr partridge; in
which company past the agreeable conversation which will be found in
the next chapter.



chapter vii.

containing a remark or two of our own and many more of the good
company assembled in the kitchen.


though the pride of partridge did not submit to acknowledge himself a
servant, yet he condescended in most particulars to imitate the
manners of that rank. one instance of this was, his greatly magnifying
the fortune of his companion, as he called jones: such is a general
custom with all servants among strangers, as none of them would
willingly be thought the attendant on a beggar: for, the higher the
situation of the master is, the higher consequently is that of the man
in his own opinion; the truth of which observation ap

 of their masters, and little or none at all for their character
in other points, and that, though they would be ashamed to be the
footman of a beggar, they are not so to attend upon a rogue or a
blockhead; and do consequently make no scruple to spread the fame of
the iniquities and follies of their said masters as far as possible,
and this often with great humour and merriment. in reality, a footman
is often a wit as well as a beau, at the expence of the gentleman
whose livery he wears.

after partridge, therefore, had enlarged greatly on the vast fortune
to which mr jones was heir, he very freely communicated an
apprehension, which he had begun to conceive the day before, and for
which, as we hinted at that very time, the behaviour of jones seemed
to have furnished a sufficient foundation. in short, he was now pretty
well confirmed in an opinion that his master was out of his wits, with
which opinion he very bluntly acquainted the good company round the
fire.

with this sentiment the puppet-s

about his eyes, which i took notice of before, though i did not
mention it.”

the landlord agreed with this last assertion, and likewise claimed the
sagacity of having observed it. “and certainly,” added he, “it must be
so; for no one but a madman would have thought of leaving so good a
house to ramble about the country at that time of night.”

the exciseman, pulling his pipe from his mouth, said, “he thought the
gentleman looked and talked a little wildly;” and then turning to
partridge, “if he be a madman,” says he, “he should not be suffered to
travel thus about the country; for possibly he may do some mischief.
it is a pity he was not secured and sent home to his relations.”

now some conceits of this kind were likewise lurking in the mind of
partridge; for, as he was now persuaded that jones had run away from
mr allworthy, he promised himself the highest rewards if he could by
any means convey him back. but fear of jones, of whose fierceness and
strength he had see
 
 ___________________________
 
n, and indeed felt, some instances, had however
represented any such scheme as impossible to be executed, and had
discouraged him from applying himself to form any regular plan for the
purpose. but no sooner did he hear the sentiments of the exciseman
than he embraced that opportunity of declaring his own, and expressed
a hearty wish that such a matter could be brought about.

“could be brought about!” says the exciseman: “why, there is nothing
easier.”

“ah! sir,” answered partridge, “you don’t know what a devil of a
fellow he is. he can take me up with one hand, and throw me out at
window; and he would, too, if he did but imagine--”

“pogh!” says the exciseman, “i believe i am as good a man as he.
besides, here are five of us.”

“i don’t know what five,” cries the landlady, “my husband shall have
nothing to do in it. nor shall any violent hands be laid upon anybody
in my house. the young gentleman is as pretty a young gentleman as
ever i saw in my li

f his right.”

“very likely!” cries the landlady. “i myself knew a poor gentleman who
was kept in a mad-house all his life by his family, and they enjoyed
his estate, but it did them no good; for though the law gave it them,
it was the right of another.”

“pogh!” cries the clerk, with great contempt, “who hath any right but
what the law gives them? if the law gave me the best estate in the
country, i should never trouble myself much who had the right.”

“if it be so,” says partridge, “_felix quem faciunt aliena pericula
cautum.”_

my landlord, who had been called out by the arrival of a horseman at
the gate, now returned into the kitchen, and with an affrighted
countenance cried out, “what do you think, gentlemen? the rebels have
given the duke the slip, and are got almost to london. it is certainly
true, for a man on horseback just now told me so.”

“i am glad of it with all my heart,” cries partridge; “then there will
be no fighting in these parts.”

“i

er reason; for i would always
have right take place.”

“ay, but,” answered the landlord, “i have heard some people say this
man hath no right.”

“i will prove the contrary in a moment,” cries the clerk: “if my
father dies seized of a right; do you mind me, seized of a right, i
say; doth not that right descend to his son; and doth not one right
descend as well as another?”

“but how can he have any right to make us papishes?” says the
landlord.

“never fear that,” cries partridge. “as to the matter of right, the
gentleman there hath proved it as clear as the sun; and as to the
matter of religion, it is quite out of the case. the papists
themselves don’t expect any such thing. a popish priest, whom i know
very well, and who is a very honest man, told me upon his word and
honour they had no such design.”

“and another priest, of my acquaintance,” said the landlady, “hath
told me the same thing; but my husband is always so afraid of
papishes. i know a great man

ut of my religion in hopes only
of keeping my place under another government; for i should certainly
be no better, and very probably might be worse.”

“why, that is what i say,” cries the landlord, “whenever folks say who
knows what may happen! odsooks! should not i be a blockhead to lend my
money to i know not who, because mayhap he may return it again? i am
sure it is safe in my own bureau, and there i will keep it.”

the attorney’s clerk had taken a great fancy to the sagacity of
partridge. whether this proceeded from the great discernment which the
former had into men, as well as things, or whether it arose from the
sympathy between their minds; for they were both truly jacobites in
principle; they now shook hands heartily, and drank bumpers of strong
beer to healths which we think proper to bury in oblivion.

these healths were afterwards pledged by all present, and even by my
landlord himself, though reluctantly; but he could not withstand the
menaces of the clerk, who swore h

use she likes me better than you.”

jones no sooner heard this than he quitted the master, laying on him
at the same time the most violent injunctions of forbearance from any
further insult on the merry-andrew; and then taking the poor wretch
with him into his own apartment, he soon learned tidings of his
sophia, whom the fellow, as he was attending his master with his drum
the day before, had seen pass by. he easily prevailed with the lad to
show him the exact place, and then having summoned partridge, he
departed with the utmost expedition.

it was almost eight of the clock before all matters could be got ready
for his departure: for partridge was not in any haste, nor could the
reckoning be presently adjusted; and when both these were settled and
over, jones would not quit the place before he had perfectly
reconciled all differences between the master and the man.

when this was happily accomplished, he set forwards, and was by the
trusty merry-andrew conducted to the spot by which sophia 
 
 ___________________________
 
had past;
and then having handsomely rewarded his conductor, he again pushed on
with the utmost eagerness, being highly delighted with the
extraordinary manner in which he received his intelligence. of this
partridge was no sooner acquainted, than he, with great earnestness,
began to prophesy, and assured jones that he would certainly have good
success in the end: for, he said, “two such accidents could never have
happened to direct him after his mistress, if providence had not
designed to bring them together at last.” and this was the first time
that jones lent any attention to the superstitious doctrines of his
companion.

they had not gone above two miles when a violent storm of rain
overtook them; a
 
 ___________________________
 
nd, as they happened to be at the same time in sight
of an ale-house, partridge, with much earnest entreaty, prevailed with
jones to enter, and weather the storm. hunger is an enemy (if indeed
it may be called one) which partakes more of the english than of the
french disposition; for, though you subdue this never so often, it
will always rally again in time; and so it did with partridge, who was
no sooner arrived within the kitchen, than he began to ask the same
questions which he had asked the night before. the consequence of this
was an excellent cold chine being produced upon the table, upon which
not only partridge, but jones himself, made a very hearty breakfast,
though the latter began to grow again uneasy, as the people of the
house could give him no fresh information concerning sophia.

their meal being over, jones was again preparing to sally,
notwithstanding the viol

ence of the storm still continued; but
partridge begged heartily for another mug; and at last casting his
eyes on a lad at the fire, who had entered into the kitchen, and who
at that instant was looking as earnestly at him, he turned suddenly to
jones, and cried, “master, give me your hand, a single mug shan’t
serve the turn this bout. why, here’s more news of madam sophia come
to town. the boy there standing by the fire is the very lad that rode
before her. i can swear to my own plaister on his face.”--“heavens
bless you, sir,” c

happily sophia had
erred in her opinion of jones, she had sufficient reason for her
opinion; since, i believe, every other young lady would, in her
situation, have erred in the same manner. nay, had she followed her
lover at this very time, and had entered this very alehouse the moment
he was departed from it, she would have found the landlord as well
acquainted with her name and person as the wench at upton had appeared
to be. for while jones was examining his boy in whispers in an inner
room, partridge, who had no such delicacy in his disposition, was in
the kitchen very openly catechising the other guide who had attended
mrs fitzpatrick; by which means the landlord, whose ears were open on
all such occasions, became perfectly well acquainted with the tumble
of sophia from her horse, &c., with the mistake concerning jenny
cameron, with the many consequences of the punch, and, in short, with
almost everything which had happened at the inn whence we despatched
our ladies in a coach-and-six when

chapter ix.

containing little more than a few odd observations.


jones had been absent a full half-hour, when he returned into the
kitchen in a hurry, desiring the landlord to let him know that instant
what was to pay. and now the concern which partridge felt at being
obliged to quit the warm chimney-corner, and a cup of excellent
liquor, was somewhat compensated by hearing that he was to proceed no
farther on foot, for jones, by golden arguments, had prevailed with
the boy to attend him back to the inn whither he had before conducted
sophia; but to this however the lad consented, upon condition that the
other guide would wait for him at the alehouse; because, as the
landlord at upton was an intimate acquaintance of the landlord at
gloucester, 
 
 ___________________________
 
it might some time or other come to the ears of the latter
that his horses had been let to more than one person; and so the boy
might be brought to account for money which he wisely intended to put
in his own pocket.

we were obliged to mention this circumstance, trifling as it may seem,
since it retarded mr jones a considerable time in his setting out; for
the honesty of this latter boy was somewhat high--that is, somewhat
high-priced, and would indeed have cost jones very dear, had not
partridge, who, as we have said, was a very cunning fellow, artfully
thrown in half-a-crown to be spent at that very alehouse, while the
boy was waiting for his companion. this half-crown the landlord no
sooner got scent of, than he opened after it with such vehement and
persuasive outcry, that the boy was soon overcome, and consented to
take half-a-crown more for his stay. here we cannot help observing,
that as there is so much of policy in the lowest life, great men often
overvalue themselves on those

refinements in imposture, in which they
are frequently excelled by some of the lowest of the human species.

the horses being now produced, jones directly leapt into the
side-saddle, on which his dear sophia had rid. the lad, indeed, very
civilly offered him the use of his; but he chose the side-saddle,
probably because it was softer. partridge, however, though full as
effeminate as jones, could not bear the thoughts of degrading his
manhood; he therefore accepted the boy’s offer: and now, jones being
mounted on the side-saddle of his sophia, the boy on that of mrs
honour, and partridge bestriding the third horse, they set forwards on
their journey, and within four hours arrived at the inn where the
reader hath already spent so much time. partridge was in very high
spirits during the whole way, and often mentioned to jones the many

 
 ___________________________
 
good omens of his future success which had lately befriended him; and
which the reader, without being the least superstitious, must allow to
have been particularly fortunate. partridge was moreover better
pleased with the present pursuit of his companion than he had been
with his pursuit of glory; and from these very omens, which assured
the pedagogue of success, he likewise first acquired a clear idea of
the amour between jones and sophia; to which he had before given very
little attention, as he had originally taken a wrong scent concerning
the reasons of jones’s departure; and as to what happened at upton, he
was too much frightened just before and after his leaving that

e as often ashamed of thinking right as of thinking wrong),
it is certain he secretly approved as much of his sentiments as he
understood, and really felt a very strong impulse of compassion for
him. but we may possibly take some other opportunity of commenting
upon this, especially if we should happen to meet mr dowling any more
in the course of our history. at present we are obliged to take our
leave of that gentleman a little abruptly, in imitation of mr jones;
who was no sooner informed, by partridge, that his horses were ready,
than he deposited his reckoning, wished his companion a good night,
mounted, and set forward towards coventry, though the night was dark,
and it just then began to rain very hard.



chapter xi.

the disasters which befel jones on his departure for coventry; with
the sage remarks of partridge.


no road can be plainer than that from the place where they now were to
coventry; and though neither jones, nor partridge, nor the guide, had
ever travelled it before, it wou
 
 ___________________________
 
 is not, perhaps, easy for a reader, who hath never been in those
circumstances, to imagine the horror with which darkness, rain, and
wind, fill persons who have lost their way in the night; and who,
consequently, have not the pleasant prospect of warm fires, dry
cloaths, and other refreshments, to support their minds in struggling
with the inclemencies of the weather. a very imperfect idea of this
horror will, however, serve sufficiently to account for the conceits
which now filled the head of partridge, and which we shall presently
be obliged to open.

jones grew more and more positive that they were out of their road;
and the boy himself at last acknowledged he believed they were not in
the right road to coventry; though he affirmed, at the same time, it
was impossible they should have mist the way. but partridge was of a
different opinion. he said, “when they first set out he imagined some
mischief or other would happen.--did not you observe, sir,” said he to
jones, “that old woman wh
 
 ___________________________
 
 it is always good to be charitable to those sort of people,
for fear what may happen; and many a person hath lost his cattle by
saving a halfpenny.”

jones, though he was horridly vexed at the delay which this mistake
was likely to occasion in his journey, could not help smiling at the
superstition of his friend, whom an accident now greatly confirmed in
his opinion. this was a tumble from his horse; by which, however, he
received no other injury than what the dirt conferred on his cloaths.

partridge had no sooner recovered his legs, than he appealed to his
fall, as conclusive evidence of all he had asserted; but jones finding
he was unhurt, answered with a smile: “this witch of yours, partridge,
is a most ungrateful jade, and doth not, i find, distinguish her
friends from others in her resentment. if the old lady had been angry
with me for neglecting her, i don’t see why she should tumble you from
your horse, after all the respect you have expressed for her.”

“it is ill jesting,
 
 ___________________________
 
 cries partridge, “with people who have power to
do these things; for they are often very malicious. i remember a
farrier, who provoked one of them, by asking her when the time she had
bargained with the devil for would be out; and within three months
from that very day one of his best cows was drowned. nor was she
satisfied with that; for a little time afterwards he lost a barrel of
best-drink: for the old witch pulled out the spigot, and let it run
all over the cellar, the very first evening he had tapped i

t to make
merry with some of his neighbours. in short, nothing ever thrived with
him afterwards; for she worried the poor man so, that he took to
drinking; and in a year or two his stock was seized, and he and his
family are now come to the parish.”

the guide, and perhaps his horse too, were both so attentive to this
discourse, that, either through want of care, or by the malice of the
witch, they were now both sprawling in the dirt.

partridge entirely imputed this fall, as he had done his own, to the
same cause. he told mr jones, “it would certainly be his turn next;
and earnestly entreated him to return back, and find out the old
woman, and pacify her. we shall very soon,” added he, “reach the inn;
for though we have seemed to go forward, i am very certain we are in
the identical place in which we were an hour ago; and i dare swear, if
it was daylight, we might now see the inn we set out from.”

instead of returning any ans
 
 ___________________________
 
wer to this sage advice, jones was
entirely attentive to what had happened to the boy, who received no
other hurt than what had before befallen partridge, and which his
cloaths very easily bore, as they had been for many years inured to
the like. he soon regained his side-saddle, and by the hearty curses
and blows which he bestowed on his horse, quickly satisfied mr jones
that no harm was done.



chapter xii.

relates that mr jones continued his journey, contrary to the advice of
partridge, with what happened on that occasion.


they now discovered a light at some distance, to the great pleasure of
jones, and to the no small terror of partridge, who firmly believed
himself to be bewitched, and that this light was a jack-with-a-lantern,
or somewhat more mischievous.

but how were these fears increased, when, as they approached nearer to
this light (or lights as they now appeared), they heard a confused
sound of human voices; of singing, laughing, and hallowing, together
with a str
 
 ___________________________
 
ange noise that seemed to proceed from some instruments; but
could hardly be allowed the name of music! indeed, to favour a little
the opinion of partridge, it might very well be called music
bewitched.

it is impossible to conceive a much greater degree of horror than what
now seized on partridge; the contagion of which had reached the
post-boy, who had been very attentive to many things that the other
had uttered. he now, therefore, joined in petitioning jones to return;
saying he firmly believed what partridge had just before said, that
though the horses seemed to go on, they had not moved a step forwards
during at least the last half-hour.

jones could not help smiling in the midst of his vexation, at the
fears of these poor fellows. “either we advance,” says he, “towards
the l
 
 ___________________________
 
ights, or the lights have advanced towards us; for we are now at
a very little distance from them; but how can either of you be afraid
of a set of people who appear only to be merry-making?”

“merry-making, sir!” cries partridge; “who could be merry-making at
this time of night, and in such a place, and such weather? they can be
nothing but ghosts or witches, or some evil spirits or other, that’s
certain.”

“let them be what they will,” cries jones, “i am resolved to go up to
them, and enquire the way to coventry. all witches, partridge, are not
such ill-natured hags as that we had the misfortune to meet with
last.”

“o lord, sir,” cries partridge, “there is no knowing what humour they
will be in; t
 
 ___________________________
 
hould meet with something worse than witches, with evil spirits
themselves?----pray, sir, be advised; pray, sir, do. if you had read
so many terrible accounts as i have of these matters, you would not be
so fool-hardy.----the lord knows whither we have got already, or
whither we are going; for sure such darkness was never seen upon
earth, and i question whether it can be darker in the other world.”

jones put forwards as fast as he could, notwithstanding all these
hints and cautions, and poor partridge was obliged to follow; for
though he hardly dared to advance, he dared still less to stay behind
by himself.

at length they arrived at the place whence the lights and different
noises had issued. this jones perceived to be no other than a barn,
where a great number of men and women were assembled, and diverting
themselves with much apparent jollity.

jones no sooner appeared before the great doors of the barn, which
were open, than a masculine and very rough voice from within demanded,
who was

 cries another of the men in the barn, “you had
better alight till the storm is over” (for indeed it was now more
violent than ever;) “you are very welcome to put up your horse; for
there is sufficient room for him at the end of the barn.”

“you are very obliging,” returned jones; “and i will accept your offer
for a few minutes, whilst the rain continues; and here are two more
who will be glad of the same favour.” this was accorded with more
good-will than it was accepted: for partridge would rather have
submitted to the utmost inclemency of the weather than have trusted to
the clemency of those whom he took for hobgoblins; and the poor
post-boy was now infected with the same apprehensions; but they were
both obliged to follow the example of jones; the one because he durst
not leave his horse, and the other because he feared nothing so much
as being left by himself.

had this history been writ in the days of superstition, i should have
had too much compassion for the reader to
 
 ___________________________
 
take a voyage into fairy-land, and introduce
a set of beings into our history, which scarce any one was ever
childish enough to believe, though many have been foolish enough to
spend their time in writing and reading their adventures.

to prevent, therefore, any such suspicions, so prejudicial to the
credit of an historian, who professes to draw his materials from
nature only, we shall now proceed to acquaint the reader who these
people were, whose sudden appearance had struck such terrors into
partridge, had more than half frightened the post-boy, and had a
little surprized even mr jones himself.

the people then assembled in this barn were no other than a company of
egyptians, or, as they are vulgarly called, gypsies, and they were now
celebrating the wedding of one of their society.

it is impossible to conceive a happier set of people than appeared
here to be met together. the utmost mirth, indeed, shewed itself in
every countenance; nor was their ball totally void of all order and
decorum.

e consequence
of all punishment. “dat be ver strange,” said the king; “for me know
and hears good deal of your people, dough me no live among dem; and me
have often hear dat sham is de consequence and de cause too of many of
your rewards. are your rewards and punishments den de same ting?”

while his majesty was thus discoursing with jones, a sudden uproar
arose in the barn, and as it seems upon this occasion:--the courtesy
of these people had by degrees removed all the apprehensions of
partridge, and he was prevailed upon not only to stuff himself with
their food, but to taste some of their liquors, which by degrees
entirely expelled all fear from his composition, and in its stead
introduced much more agreeable sensations.

a young female gypsy, more remarkable for her wit than her beauty, had
decoyed the honest fellow aside, pretending to tell his fortune. now,
when they were alone together in a remote part of the barn, whether it
proceeded from the strong liquor, which is never so ap
 
 ___________________________
 
t to inflame
inordinate desire as after moderate fatigue; or whether the fair gypsy
herself threw aside the delicacy and decency of her sex, and tempted
the youth partridge with express solicitations; but they were
discovered in a very improper manner by the husband of the gypsy, who,
from jealousy it seems, had kept a watchful eye over his wife, and had
dogged her to the place, where he found her in the arms of her
gallant.

to the great confusion of jones, partridge was now hurried before the
king; who heard the accusation, and likewise the culprit’s defence,
which was indeed very trifling; for the poor fellow was confounded by
the plain evidence which appeared against him, and had very little to
say for himself. his majesty, then turning towards jones, said, “sir,
you have hear what dey say; what punishment do you tink your man
deserve?”

jones answered, “he was sorry for what had happened, and that
partridge should make the husband all the amends
 
 ___________________________
 
 in his power: he
said, he had very little money about him at that time;” and, putting
his hand into his pocket, offered the fellow a guinea. to which he
immediately answered, “he hoped his honour would not think of giving
him less than five.”

this sum, after some altercation, was reduced to two; and jones,
having stipulated for the full forgiveness of both partridge and the
wife, was going to pay the money; when his majesty, restraining his
hand, turned to the witness and asked him, “at what time he had
discovered the criminals?” to which he answered, “that he had been
desired by the husband to watch the motions of his wife from her first
speaking to the stranger, and that he had never lost sight of her
afterwards till the crime had been committed.” the king then asked,
“if the husband was with him all that time in his lurking-place?” to
which

her. me do order dat you have no money given you, for you deserve
punishment, not reward; me do order derefore, dat you be de infamous
gypsy, and do wear pair of horns upon your forehead for one month, and
dat your wife be called de whore, and pointed at all dat time; for you
be de infamous gypsy, but she be no less de infamous whore.”

the gypsies immediately proceeded to execute the sentence, and left
jones and partridge alone with his majesty.

jones greatly applauded the justice of the sentence: upon which the
king, turning to him, said, “me believe you be surprize: for me
suppose you have ver bad opinion of my people; me suppose you tink us
all de tieves.”

“i must confess, sir,” said jones, “i have not heard so favourable an
account of them as they seem to deserve.”

“me vil tell you,” said the king, “how the difference is between you
and us. my people rob your people, and your people rob

nor can the example of the gypsies, though possibly they may have long
been happy under this form of government, be here urged; since we must
remember the very material respect in which they differ from all other
people, and to which perhaps this their happiness is entirely owing,
namely, that they have no false honours among them, and that they look
on shame as the most grievous punishment in the world.



chapter xiii.

a dialogue between jones and partridge.


the honest lovers of liberty will, we doubt not, pardon that long
digression into which we were led at the close of the last chapter, to
prevent our history from being applied to the use of the most
pernicious doctrine which priestcraft had ever the wickedness or the
impudence to preach.

we will now proceed with mr jones, who, when the storm was over, took
leave of his egyptian majesty, after many thanks for his courteous
behaviour and kind entertainment, and set out for coventry; to which

 
 ___________________________
 
y was ordered to conduct him.

jones having, by reason of his deviation, travelled eleven miles
instead of six, and most of those through very execrable roads, where
no expedition could have been made in quest of a midwife, did not
arrive at coventry till near twelve. nor could he possibly get again
into the saddle till past two; for post-horses were now not easy to
get; nor were the hostler or post-boy in half so great a hurry as
himself, but chose rather to imitate the tranquil disposition of
partridge; who, being denied the nourishment of sleep, took all
opportunities to supply its place with every other kind of
nourishment, and was never better pleased than when he arrived at an
inn, nor ever more dissatisfied than when he was again forced to leave
it.

jones now travelled post; we will follow him, therefore, according to
our custom, and to the rules of longinus, in the same manner. from
coventry he arrived at daventry, from daventry at stratford, and from
stratford at dunstable, whither he
 
 ___________________________
 
gel at the aforesaid place; but unluckily my lord had
appointed a dinner to be prepared for him at his own house in london,
and, in order to enable him to reach that place in proper time, he had
ordered a relay of horses to meet him at st albans. when jones
therefore arrived there, he was informed that the coach-and-six had
set out two hours before.

if fresh post-horses had been now ready, as they were not, it seemed
so apparently impossible to overtake the coach before it reached
london, that partridge thought he had now a proper opportunity to
remind his friend of a matter which he seemed entirely to have
forgotten; what this was the reader will guess, when we inform him
that jones had eat nothing more than one poached egg since he had left
the alehouse where he had first met the guide returning from sophia;
for with the gypsies he had feasted only his understanding.

the landlord so entirely agreed with the opinion of mr partridge, that
he no sooner heard the latter desire his friend to sta
 
 ___________________________
 
ne, than
he very readily put in his word, and retracting his promise before
given of furnishing the horses immediately, he assured mr jones he
would lose no time in bespeaking a dinner, which, he said, could be
got ready sooner than it was possible to get the horses up from grass,
and to prepare them for their journey by a feed of corn.

jones was at length prevailed on, chiefly by the latter argument of
the landlord; and now a joint of mutton was put down to the fire.
while this was preparing, partridge, being admitted into the same
apartment with his friend or master, began to harangue in the
following manner.

“certainly, sir, if ever man deserved a young lady, you deserve young
madam western; for what a vast quantity of love must a man have, to be
able to live upon it without any other food, as you do? i am positive
i have eat thirty times as much within these last twenty-four hours as
your honour, and yet i am almost famished; for nothing makes a man so
hungry as travelling, especially i
 
 ___________________________
 
n this cold raw weather. and yet i
can’t tell how it is, but your honour is seemingly in perfect good
health, and you never looked better nor fresher in your life. it must
be certainly love that you live upon.”

“and a very rich diet too, partridge,” answered jones. “but did not
fortune send me an excellent dainty yesterday? dost thou imagine i
cannot live more than twenty-four hours on this dear pocket-book?”

“undoubtedly,” cries partridge, “there is enough in that pocket-book
to purchase many a good meal. fortune sent it to your honour very
opportunely for present use, as your honour’s money must be almost out
by this time.”

“what do you mean?” answered jones; “i hope you don’t imagine that i
should be dishonest enough, even if it belonged to any other person,
besides miss western----”

“dishonest!” replied partridge, “heaven forbid i should wrong your
honour so much! but where’s the dishonesty in borrow

i might have thought
it was the devil’s money, and have been afraid to use it; but as you
know otherwise, and came honestly by it, it would be an affront to
fortune to part with it all again, at the very time when you want it
most; you can hardly expect she should ever do you such another good
turn; for _fortuna nunquam perpetuo est bona_. you will do as you
please, notwithstanding all i say; but for my part, i would be hanged
before i mentioned a word of the matter.”

“by what i can see, partridge,” cries jones, “hanging is a matter _non
longe alienum a scaevolae studiis_.” “you should say _alienus_,” says
partridge,--“i remember the passage; it is an example under _communis,
alienus, immunis, variis casibus serviunt_.” “if you do remember it,”
 cries jones, “i find you don’t understand it; but i tell thee, friend,
in plain english, that he who finds another’s property, and wilfully
detains it from the known owner, deserves, _in foro conscientiae_, to

“i should not have mentioned it now,” cries partridge, “if it had

that i should not have lived so many years, and have taught school so

live to my years: for i remember i thought myself as wise when i was a
stripling of one or two and twenty as i am now. i am sure i always
taught _alienus_, and my master read it so before me.”

there were not many instances in which partridge could provoke jones,
nor were there many in which partridge himself could have been hurried
out of his respect. unluckily, however, they had both hit on one of
these. we have already seen partridge could not bear to have his
learning attacked, nor could jones bear some passage or other in the
foregoing speech. and now, looking upon his companion with a
contemptuous and disdainful air (a thing not usual with him), he
cried, “partridge, i see thou art a conceited old fool, and i wish
thou art n

at he had never intended it; but _nemo
omnibus horis sapit_.

as jones had the vices of a warm disposition, he was entirely free
from those of a cold one; and if his friends must have confest his
temper to have been a little too easily ruffled, his enemies must at
the same time have confest, that it as soon subsided; nor did it at
all resemble the sea, whose swelling is more violent and dangerous
after a storm is over than while the storm itself subsists. he
instantly accepted the submission of partridge, shook him by the hand,
and with the most benign aspect imaginable, said twenty kind things,
and at the same time very severely condemned himself, though not half
so severely as he will most probably be condemned by many of our good
readers.

partridge was now highly comforted, as his fears of having offended
were at once abolished, and his pride completely satisfied by jones
having owned himself in the wrong, which submission he instantly
applied to what had principally nettled him, and repeat

irmative. the gentleman replied, “i
should be obliged to you, sir, if you will accept of my company; for
it is very late, and i am a stranger to the road.” jones readily
complied with the request; and on they travelled together, holding
that sort of discourse which is usual on such occasions.

of this, indeed, robbery was the principal topic: upon which subject
the stranger expressed great apprehensions; but jones declared he had
very little to lose, and consequently as little to fear. here
partridge could not forbear putting in his word. “your honour,” said
he, “may think it a little, but i am sure, if i had a hundred-pound
bank-note in my pocket, as you have, i should be very sorry to lose
it; but, for my part, i never was less afraid in my life; for we are
four of us, and if we all stand by one another, the best man in
england can’t rob us. suppose he should have a pistol, he can kill but
one of us, and a man can die but once.--that’s my comfort, a man can
die but once.”

bes

ides the reliance on superior numbers, a kind of valour which hath
raised a certain nation among the moderns to a high pitch of glory,
there was another reason for the extraordinary courage which partridge
now discovered; for he had at present as much of that quality as was
in the power of liquor to bestow.

our company were now arrived within a mile of highgate, when the
stranger turned short upon jones, and pulling out a pistol, demanded
that little bank-note which partridge had mentioned.

jones was at first somewhat shocked at this unexpected demand;
however, he presently recollected himself, and told the highwayman,
all the money he had in his pocket was entirely at his service; and so
saying, he pulled out upwards of three guineas, and offered to deliver
it; but the other answered with an oath, that would not do. jones
answered coolly, he was very sorry for it, and returned the money into
his pocket.

the highwayman then threatened, if he did not deliver the ba
 
 ___________________________
 
mplore mercy of the conqueror: for, to
say the truth, he was in strength by no means a match for jones.
“indeed, sir,” says he, “i could have had no intention to shoot you;
for you will find the pistol was not loaded. this is the first robbery
i ever attempted, and i have been driven by distress to this.”

at this instant, at about a hundred and fifty yards’ distance, lay
another person on the ground, roaring for mercy in a much louder voice
than the highwayman. this was no other than partridge himself, who,
endeavouring to make his escape from the engagement, had been thrown
from his horse, and lay flat on his face, not daring to look up, and
expecting every minute to be shot.

in this posture he lay, till the guide, who was no otherwise concerned
than for his horses, having secured the stumbling beast, came up to
him, and told him his master had got the better of the highwayman.

partridge leapt up at this news, and ran back to the place where jones
stood with his sword drawn in his
 
 ___________________________
 
 hand to guard the poor fellow; which
partridge no sooner saw than he cried out, “kill the villain, sir, run
him through the body, kill him this instant!”

luckily, however, for the poor wretch, he had fallen into more
merciful hands; for jones having examined the pistol, and found it to
be really unloaded, began to believe all the man had told him, before
partridge came up: namely, that he was a novice in the trade, and that
he had been driven to it by the distress he mentioned, the greatest
indeed imaginable, that of five hungry children, and a wife lying in
of the sixth, in the utmost want and misery. the truth of all which
the highwayman most vehemently asserted, and offered to convince mr
jones of it, if he would take the trouble to go to his house, which
was not above two miles off; saying, “that he desired no favour, but
upon condition of proving 
 
 ___________________________
 
s of relieving his distress, and gave him a couple of guineas for
the immediate support of his wife and his family; adding, “he wished
he had more for his sake, for the hundred pound that had been
mentioned was not his own.”

our readers will probably be divided in their opinions concerning this
action; some may applaud it perhaps as an act of extraordinary
humanity, while those of a more saturnine temper will consider it as a
want of regard to that justice which every man owes his country.
partridge certainly saw it in that light; for he testified much
dissatisfaction on the occasion, quoted an old proverb, and said, he
should not wonder if the rogue attacked them again before they reached
london.

the highwayman was full of expressions of thankfulness and gratitude.
he actually dropt tears, or pretended so to do. he vowed he would
immediately return home, and would never afterwards commit such a
transgression: whether he kept his word or no, perhaps may appear
hereafter.

our travellers h

aving remounted their horses, arrived in town without
encountering any new mishap. on the road much pleasant discourse
passed between jones and partridge, on the subject of their last
adventure: in which jones exprest a great compassion for those
highwaymen who are, by unavoidable distress, driven, as it were, to
such illegal courses, as generally bring them to a shameful death: “i
mean,” said he, “those only whose highest guilt extends no farther
than to robbery, and who are never guilty of cruelty nor insult to any
person, which is a circumstance that, i must say, to the honour of our
country, distinguishes the robbers of england from th
 
 ___________________________
 
ose of all other
nations; for murder is, amongst those, almost inseparably incident to
robbery.”

“no doubt,” answered partridge, “it is better to take away one’s money
than one’s life; and yet it is very hard upon honest men, that they
can’t travel about their business without being in danger of these
villains. and to be sure it would be better that all rogues were
hanged out of the way, than that one honest man should suffer. for my
own part, indeed, i should not care to have the blood of any of them
on my own hands; but it is very proper for the law to hang them all.
what right hath any man to take sixpence fr

om me, unless i give it
him? is there any honesty in such a man?”

“no, surely,” cries jones, “no more than there is in him who takes the
horses out of another man’s stable, or who applies to his own use the
money which he finds, when he knows the right owner.”

these hints stopt the mouth of partridge; nor did he open it again
till jones, having thrown some sarcastical jokes on his cowardice, he
offered to excuse himself on the inequality of fire-arms, saying, “a
thousand naked men are nothing to one pistol; for though it is true it
will kill but one at a single discharge, yet who can tell but that one
may be himself?”

 in this history, the reader will conclude,
doubtless, it must have been an easy matter to have discovered his
house in london without knowing the particular street or square which
he inhabited, since he must have been one _whom everybody knows_. to
say the truth, so it would have been to any of those tradesmen who are
accustomed to attend the regions of the great; for the doors of the
great are generally no less easy to find than it is difficult to get
entrance into them. but jones, as well as partridge, was an entire
stranger in london; and as he happened to arrive first in a quarter of
the town, the inhabitants of which have very little intercourse with
the householders of hanover or grosvenor-square (for he entered
through gray’s-inn-lane), so he rambled about some time before he
could even find his way to those happy mansions where fortune
segregates from the vulgar those magnanimous heroes, the descendants
of antient britons, saxons, or danes, whose ancestors, being born in
better days,
 
 ___________________________
 
kinds of merit, have entailed riches and honour
on their posterity.

jones, being at length arrived at those terrestrial elysian fields,
would now soon have discovered his lordship’s mansion; but the peer
unluckily quitted his former house when he went for ireland; and as he
was just entered into a new one, the fame of his equipage had not yet
sufficiently blazed in the neighbourhood; so that, after a successless
enquiry till the clock had struck eleven, jones at last yielded to the
advice of partridge, and retreated to the bull and gate in holborn,
that being the inn where he had first alighted, and where he retired
to enjoy that kind of repose which usually attends persons in his
circumstances.

early in the morning he again set forth in pursuit of sophia; and many
a weary step he took to no better purpose than before. at last,
whether it was that fortune relented, or whether it was no longer in
her power to disappoint him, he came into the very street which was
honoured by his lordship’s

of his person, made an impression on the waiting-woman, and she could
not help answering; “perhaps, sir, you may;” and, indeed, she
afterwards said everything to her mistress, which she thought most
likely to prevail on her to admit a visit from the handsome young
gentleman; for so she called him.

jones very shrewdly suspected that sophia herself was now with her
cousin, and was denied to him; which he imputed to her resentment of
what had happened at upton. having, therefore, dispatched partridge to
procure him lodgings, he remained all day in the street, watching the
door where he thought his angel lay concealed; but no person did he
see issue forth, except a servant of the house, and in the evening he
returned to pay his visit to mrs fitzpatrick, which that good lady at
last condescended to admit.

there is a certain air of natural gentility, which it is neither in
the power of dress to give, nor to conceal. mr jones, as hath been
before hinted, was possessed of this in a very eminent

rt of the town.

mr jones, then, had often heard mr allworthy mention the gentlewoman
at whose house he used to lodge when he was in town. this person, who,
as jones likewise knew, lived in bond-street, was the widow of a
clergyman, and was left by him, at his decease, in possession of two
daughters, and of a compleat set of manuscript sermons.

of these two daughters, nancy, the elder, was now arrived at the age
of seventeen, and betty, the younger, at that of ten.

hither jones had despatched partridge, and in this house he was
provided with a room for himself in the second floor, and with one for
partridge in the fourth.

the first floor was inhabited by one of those young gentlemen, who, in
the last age, were called men of wit and pleasure about town, and
properly enough; for as men are usually denominated from their
business or profession, so pleasure may be said to have been the only
business or profession of those gentlemen to whom fortune had made all
useful occupations unnecessary. pla

chapter vi.

what arrived while the company were at breakfast, with some hints
concerning the government of daughters.


our company brought together in the morning the same good inclinations
towards each other, with which they had separated the evening before;
but poor jones was extremely disconsolate; for he had just received
information from partridge, that mrs fitzpatrick had left her lodging,
and that he could not learn whither she was gone. this news highly
afflicted him, and his countenance, as well as his behaviour, in
defiance of all his endeavours to the contrary, betrayed manifest
indications of a disordered mind.

the discourse turned at present, as before, on love; and mr
nightingale again expressed many of those warm, generous, and
disinterested sentiments upon this subject, which wise and sober men
call romantic, but which wise a

have found that love was no more capable of allaying hunger, than a
rose is capable of delighting the ear, or a violin of gratifying the
smell.

notwithstanding, therefore, all the delicacies which love had set
before him, namely, the hopes of seeing sophia at the masquerade; on
which, however ill-founded his imagination might be, he had
voluptuously feasted during the whole day, the evening no sooner came
than mr jones began to languish for some food of a grosser kind.
partridge discovered this by intuition, and took the occasion to give
some oblique hints concerning the bank-bill; and, when these were
rejected with disdain, he collected courage enough once more to
mention a return to mr allworthy.

“partridge,” cries jones, “you cannot see my fortune in a more
desperate light than i see it myself; and i begin heartily to repent
that i suffered you to leave a place where you was settled, and to
follow me. however, i insist now on your returning home; and for the

 
 ___________________________
 
expense and trouble which you have so kindly put yourself to on my
account, all the cloaths i left behind in your care i desire you would
take as your own. i am sorry i can make you no other acknowledgment.”

he spoke these words with so pathetic an accent, that partridge, among
whose vices ill-nature or hardness of heart were not numbered, burst
into tears; and after swearing he would not quit him in his distress,
he began with the most earnest entreaties to urge his return home.
“for heaven’s sake, sir,” says he, “do but consider; what can your
honour do?--how is it possible you can live in this town without
money? do what you will, sir, or go wherever you please, i am resolved
not to desert you. but pray, sir, consider--do pray, sir, for your own
sake
 
 ___________________________
 
, take it into your consideration; and i’m sure,” says he, “that
your own good sense will bid you return home.”

“how often shall i tell thee,” answered jones, “that i have no home to
return to? had i any hopes that mr allworthy’s doors would be open to
receive me, i want no distress to urge me--nay, there is no other
cause upon earth, which could detain me a moment from flying to his
presence; but, alas! that i am for ever banished from. his last words
were--o, partridge, they still ring in my ears--his last words were,
when he gave me a sum of money--what it was i know not, but
considerable i’m sure it was--his last words were--`i am resolved from
this day forward, on no account to converse with you any more.’”

here passion stopt the mouth of jones, as surprize for a moment did
that of partridge; but he soon recovered the use of speech, and after
a short preface, in which he declared he had no inquisitiveness in his
temper, enquired what jones meant by

he masquerade, and mr
nightingale had given orders for chairs to be sent for, a circumstance
of distress occurred to jones, which will appear very ridiculous to
many of my readers. this was how to procure a shilling; but if such
readers will reflect a little on what they have themselves felt from
the want of a thousand pounds, or, perhaps, of ten or twenty, to
execute a favourite scheme, they will have a perfect idea of what mr
jones felt on this occasion. for this sum, therefore, he applied to
partridge, which was the first he had permitted him to advance, and
was the last he intended that poor fellow should advance in his
service. to say the truth, partridge had lately made no offer of this
kind. whether it was that he desired to see the bank-bill broke in
upon, or that distress should prevail on jones to return home, or from
what other motive it proceeded, i will not determine.

second meeting in the evening appointed at the same place, they
separated; the lady returned to her house, and jones to his lodgings.



chapter viii.

containing a scene of distress, which will appear very extraordinary
to most of our readers.


jones having refreshed himself with a few hours’ sleep, summoned
partridge to his presence; and delivering him a bank-note of fifty
pounds, ordered him to go and change it. partridge received this with
sparkling eyes, though, when he came to reflect farther, it raised in
him some suspicions not very advantageous to the honour of his master:
to these the dreadful idea he had of the masquerade, the disguise in
which his master had gone out and returned, and his having been abroad
all night, contributed. in plain language, the only way he could
possibly find to account f

nder the name of translations.

jones grew still more and more impatient to see sophia; and finding,
after repeated interviews with lady bellaston, no likelihood of
obtaining this by her means (for, on the contrary, the lady began to
treat even the mention of the name of sophia with resentment), he
resolved to try some other method. he made no doubt but that lady
bellaston knew where his angel was, so he thought it most likely that
some of her servants should be acquainted with the same secret.
partridge therefore was employed to get acquainted with those
servants, in order to fish this secret out of them.

few situations can be imagined more uneasy than that to which his poor
master was at present reduced; for besides the difficulties he met
with in discovering sophia, besides the fears he had of having
disobliged her, and the assurances he had received from lady bellaston
of the resolution which sophia had taken against him, and of her
having purposely concealed herself from him, which he had
 
 ___________________________
 
lightly betrayed me to grant, boasted of there! nay, even to
hear that you had been forced to fly from my love!”

nothing could equal jones’s surprize at these words of sophia; but
yet, not being guilty, he was much less embarrassed how to defend
himself than if she had touched that tender string at which his
conscience had been alarmed. by some examination he presently found,
that her supposing him guilty of so shocking an outrage against his
love, and her reputation, was entirely owing to partridge’s talk at
the inns before landlords and servants; for sophia confessed to him it
was from them that she received her intelligence. he had no very great
difficulty to make her believe that he was entirely innocent of an
offence so foreign to his character; but she had a great deal to
hinder him from going instantly home, and putting partridge to death,
which he more than once swore he would do. this point being cleared
up, they soon found themselves so well pleased with each other, that

e, with a smile, “so angry a countenance?--have i really brought a
chiding face with me?”--“if there be honour in man,” said he, “i have
done nothing to merit your anger.--you remember the appointment you
sent me; i went in pursuance.”--“i beseech you,” cried she, “do not
run through the odious recital.--answer me but one question, and i
shall be easy. have you not betrayed my honour to her?”--jones fell
upon his knees, and began to utter the most violent protestations,
when partridge came dancing and capering into the room, like one drunk
with joy, crying out, “she’s found! she’s found!--here, sir, here,
she’s here--mrs honour is upon the stairs.” “stop her a moment,” cries
jones--“here, madam, step behind the bed, i have no other room nor
closet, nor place on earth to hide you in; sure never was so damned an
accident.”--“d--n’d indeed!” said the lady, as she went to her place
of concealment; and presently afterwards in came mrs honour.
“hey-day!

who staid the
latest (for the other only brought me a letter), is a woman of very
great fashion, and my near relation.”--“i don’t know what fashion she
is of,” answered mrs miller; “but i am sure no woman of virtue, unless
a very near relation indeed, would visit a young gentleman at ten at
night, and stay four hours in his room with him alone; besides, sir,
the behaviour of her chairmen shows what she was; for they did nothing
but make jests all the evening in the entry, and asked mr partridge,
in the hearing of my own maid, if madam intended to stay with his
master all night; with a great deal of stuff not proper to be
repeated. i have really a great respect for you, mr jones, upon your
own account; nay, i have a very high obligation to you for your
generosity to my cousin. indeed, i did not know how very good you had
been till lately. little did i imagine to what dreadful courses the
poor man’s distress had driven him. little did i think, when you gave
me the ten guineas, that yo

--“i am sorry we must
part then, sir,” said she; “but i am convinced mr allworthy himself
would never come within my doors, if he had the least suspicion of my
keeping an ill house.”--“very well, madam,” said jones.--“i hope,
sir,” said she, “you are not angry; for i would not for the world
offend any of mr allworthy’s family. i have not slept a wink all night
about this matter.”--“i am sorry i have disturbed your rest, madam,”
 said jones, “but i beg you will send partridge up to me immediately;”
 which she promised to do, and then with a very low courtesy retired.

as soon as partridge arrived, jones fell upon him in the most
outrageous manner. “how often,” said he, “am i to suffer for your
folly, or rather for my own in keeping you? is that tongue of yours
resolved upon my destruction?” “what have i done, sir?” answered
affrighted partridge. “who was it gave you authority to mention the
story of the robbery, or that the man you saw here was the p

erson?”
 “i, sir?” cries partridge. “now don’t be guilty of a falsehood in
denying it,” said jones. “if i did mention such a matter,” answers
partridge, “i am sure i thought no harm; for i should not have opened
my lips, if it had not been to his own friends and relations, who, i
imagined, would have let it go no farther.” “but i have a much heavier
charge against you,” cries jones, “than this. how durst you, after all
the precautions i gave you, mention the name of mr allworthy in this
house?” partridge denied that he ever had, with many oaths. “how
else,” said jones, “should mrs miller be acquainted that there was any
conne
 
 ___________________________
 
xion between him and me? and it is but this moment she told me
she respected me on his account.” “o lord, sir,” said partridge, “i
desire only to be heard out; and to be sure, never was anything so
unfortunate: hear me but out, and you will own how wrongfully you have
accused me. when mrs honour came downstairs last night she met me in
the entry, and asked me when my master had heard from mr allworthy;
and to be sure mrs miller heard the very words; and the moment madam
honour was gone, she called me into the parlour to her. `mr
partridge,’ says she, `what mr allworthy is it that the gentlewoman
mentioned? is it th

looked as like her we saw in warwickshire, that caused all that

without giving her something, especially if she looks at you; for all
the world shall never persuade me but that they have a great power to
do mischief, and to be sure i shall never see an old woman again, but
i shall think to myself, _infandum, regina, jubes renovare dolorem._”

the simplicity of partridge set jones a laughing, and put a final end
to his anger, which had indeed seldom any long duration in his mind;
and, instead of commenting on his defence, he told him he intended
presently to leave those lodgings, and ordered him to go and endeavour
to get him others.

partridge had no sooner left mr jones than mr nightingale, with whom
he had now contracted a great intimacy, came to him, and, after a

d him, saying, “i suppose
you have received all this information from mrs miller, who hath been
up here a little while ago to give me warning. the good woman is
afraid, it seems, of the reputation of her daughters.” “oh! she is
wonderfully nice,” says nightingale, “upon that account; if you
remember, she would not let nancy go with us to the masquerade.” “nay,
upon my honour, i think she’s in the right of it,” says jones:
“however, i have taken her at her word, and have sent partridge to
look for another lodging.” “if you will,” says nightingale, “we may, i
believe, be again together; for, to tell you a secret, which i desire
you won’t mention in the family, i intend to quit the house to-day.”
 “what, hath mrs miller given you warning too, my friend?” cries jones.
“no,” answered the other; “but the rooms are not convenient enough.
besides, i am grown weary of this part of the town. i want to be
nearer the places of diversion; so i am going to pall-mall.

cultivated, honoured, and caressed with the utmost love and
tenderness; but, if regarded as enemies, were a conquest of which a
man ought rather to be ashamed than to value himself upon it.



chapter v.

a short account of the history of mrs miller.


jones this day eat a pretty good dinner for a sick man, that is to
say, the larger half of a shoulder of mutton. in the afternoon he
received an invitation from mrs miller to drink tea; for that good
woman, having learnt, either by means of partridge, or by some other
means natural or supernatural, that he had a connexion with mr
allworthy, could not endure the thoughts of parting with him in an
angry manner.

jones accepted the invitation; and no sooner was the tea-kettle
removed, and the girls sent out of the room, than the widow, without
much preface, began as follows: “well, there are very surprizing
things happen in this world; but certainly it is a wonderful business
that i should have a relation of mr allworthy in my house, and nev
 
 ___________________________
 
liveliest,
merriest girls in the world, was, on a sudden, become all gloom and
melancholy.”

sleep, however, at length got the better of all resistance; and now,
as if he had already been a deity, as the antients imagined, and an
offended one too, he seemed to enjoy his dear-bought conquest.--to
speak simply, and without any metaphor, mr jones slept till eleven the
next morning, and would, perhaps, have continued in the same quiet
situation much longer, had not a violent uproar awakened him.

partridge was now summoned, who, being asked what was the matter,
answered, “that there was a dreadful hurricane below-stairs; that
miss nancy was in fits; and that the other sister, and the mother,
were both crying and lamenting over her.” jones expressed much
concern at this news; which partridge endeavoured to relieve, by
saying, with a smile, “he fancied the young lady was in no danger of
death; for that susan” (which was the name of the maid) “had given
him to understand, it was nothing mo
 
 ___________________________
 
; she was a little hungry, it seems, and so sat
down to dinner before grace was said; and so there is a child coming
for the foundling hospital.”----“prithee, leave thy stupid jesting,”
 cries jones. “is the misery of these poor wretches a subject of
mirth? go immediately to mrs miller, and tell her i beg leave--stay,
you will make some blunder; i will go myself; for she desired me to
breakfast with her.” he then rose and dressed himself as fast as he
could; and while he was dressing, partridge, notwithstanding many
severe rebukes, could not avoid throwing forth certain pieces of
brutality, commonly called jests, on this occasion. jones was no
sooner dressed than he walked downstairs, and knocking at the door,
was presently admitted by the maid, into the outward parlour, which
was as empty of company as it was of any apparatus for eating. mrs
miller was in the inner room with her daughter, whence the maid
presently brought a message to mr jones, “that her mistress hoped he
would exc

courage. if
i was in love with a young man, and my father offered to lock me up,
i’d tear his eyes out but i’d come at him; but then there’s a great
fortune in the case, which it is in her father’s power either to give
her or not; that, to be sure, may make some difference.”

whether jones gave strict attention to all the foregoing harangue, or
whether it was for want of any vacancy in the discourse, i cannot
determine; but he never once attempted to answer, nor did she once
stop till partridge came running into the room, and informed him that
the great lady was upon the stairs.

nothing could equal the dilemma to which jones was now reduced. honour
knew nothing of any acquaintance that subsisted between him and lady
bellaston, and she was almost the last person in the world to whom he
would have communicated it. in this hurry and distress, he took (as is
common enough) the worst course, and, instead of exposing her to the
lady, which would have been of little consequence, he chose to

or the house to fall on his head, when an odd accident freed him from
an embarrassment out of which neither the eloquence of a cicero, nor

this was no other than the arrival of young nightingale, dead drunk;
or rather in that state of drunkenness which deprives men of the use
of their reason without depriving them of the use of their limbs.

mrs miller and her daughters were in bed, and partridge was smoaking
his pipe by the kitchen fire; so that he arrived at mr jones’s
chamber-door without any interruption. this he burst open, and was
entering without any ceremony, when jones started from his seat and
ran to oppose him, which he did so effectually, that nightingale never
came far enough within the door to see who was sitting on the bed.

nightingale had in reality mistaken jones’s apartment for that in
which himself had lodged; he therefore strongly insisted on coming in,
often sw

earing that he would not be kept from his own bed. jones,
however, prevailed over him, and delivered him into the hands of
partridge, whom the noise on the stairs soon summoned to his master’s
assistance.

and now jones was unwillingly obliged to return to his own apartment,
where at the very instant of his entrance he heard lady bellaston
venting an exclamation, though not a very loud one; and at the same
time saw her flinging herself into a chair in a vast agitation, which
in a lady of a tender constitution would have been an hysteric fit.

in reality the lady, frightened with the struggle between the two men,
of which s

when our heroe had finished and sent this letter, he went to his
scrutore, took out miss western’s muff, kissed it several times, and
then strutted some turns about his room, with more satisfaction of
mind than ever any irishman felt in carrying off a fortune of fifty
thousand pounds.

a discovery made by partridge.


while jones was exulting in the consciousness of his integrity,
partridge came capering into the room, as was his custom when he
brought, or fancied he brought, any good tidings. he had been
despatched that morning by his master, with orders to endeavour, by
the servants of lady bellaston, or by any other means, to discover
whither sophia had been conveyed; and he now returned, and with a
joyful countenance told our heroe that he had found the lost bird. “i
have seen, sir,” says he, “b

er, who is one of
the servants whom the squire hath brought with him to town. i knew him
presently, though i have not seen him these several years; but you
know, sir, he is a very remarkable man, or, to use a purer phrase, he
hath a most remarkable beard, the largest and blackest i ever saw. it
was some time, however, before black george could recollect me.”
 “well, but what is your good news?” cries jones; “what do you know of
my sophia?” “you shall know presently, sir,” answered partridge, “i am
coming to it as fast as i can. you are so impatient, sir, you would
come at the infinitive mood before you can get to the imperative. as i
was saying, sir, it was some time before he recollected my
face.”--“confound your face!” cries jones, “what of my sophia?” “nay,
sir,” answered partridge, “i know nothing more of madam sophia than
what i am going to tell you; and i should have told you all before
this if you had not interrupted me; but if you look so angry at me you

 
 ___________________________
 
will frighten all of it out of my head, or, to use a purer phrase, out
of my memory. i never saw you look so angry since the day we left
upton, which i shall remember if i was to live a thousand
years.”--“well, pray go on your own way,” said jones: “you are
resolved to make me mad i find.” “not for the world,” answered
partridge, “i have suffered enough for that already; which, as i said,
i shall bear in my remembrance the longest day i have to live.” “well,
but black george?” cries jones. “well, sir, as i was saying, it was a
long time before he could recollect me; for, indeed, i am very much
altered since i saw him. _non sum qualis eram._ i have had troubles in
the world, and nothing alters a man so much as grief. i have heard it
will change the colour of a man’s hair in a night. however, at last,

ill have her before
he comes; and, indeed, says i, mr seagrim, it is a thousand pities
somebody should not have her; for he certainly loves her above all the
women in the world. i would have both you and she know, that it is not
for her fortune he follows her; for i can assure you, as to matter of
that, there is another lady, one of much greater quality and fortune
than she can pretend to, who is so fond of somebody that she comes
after him day and night.”

here jones fell into a passion with partridge, for having, as he said,
betrayed him; but the poor fellow answered, he had mentioned no name:
“besides, sir,” said he, “i can assure you george is sincerely your
friend, and wished mr blifil at the devil more than once; nay, he said
he would do anything in his power upon earth to serve you; and so i am
convinced he will. betray you, indeed! why, i question whether you
have a better friend than george upon earth, except myself, or one
that would go farther to serve you.”

“well,” sa

ys jones, a little pacified, “you say this fellow, who, i
believe, indeed, is enough inclined to be my friend, lives in the same
house with sophia?”

“in the same house!” answered partridge; “why, sir, he is one of the
servants of the family, and very well drest i promise you he is; if it
was not for his black beard you would hardly know him.”

“one service then at least he may do me,” says jones: “sure he can
certainly convey a letter to my sophia.”

“you have hit the nail _ad unguem_” cries partridge; “how came i not
to think of it? i will engage he shall do it upon the very first
mentioning.”

“well, then,” said jones, “do you leave me at present, and

i will
write a letter, which you shall deliver to him to-morrow morning; for
i suppose you know where to find him.”

“o yes, sir,” answered partridge, “i shall certainly find him again;
there is no fear of that. the liquor is too good for him to stay away
long. i make no doubt but he will be there every day he stays in
town.”

“so you don’t know the street then where my sophia is lodged?” cries
jones.

“indeed, sir, i do,” says partridge.

“what is the name of the street?” cries jones.

“the name, sir? why, here, sir, just by,” answered partridge, “not
above a street or two off. i don’t, indeed, know the very name; for,
as he never told me, if i had asked, you know, it might have put some
suspicion into his head. no, no, sir, let me alone for that. i am too
cunning for that, i promise you.”

“thou art most wonderfully cunning, indeed,” replied jones; “however,
i will write to my charmer, since i believe you

will be cunning enough
to find him to-morrow at the alehouse.”

and now, having dismissed the sagacious partridge, mr jones sat
himself down to write, in which employment we shall leave him for a
time. and here we put an end to the fifteenth book.

great favourite with his master, as his employment was in concerns of
the highest nature, namely, about the game, and was accustomed to take
many liberties. he had officiously carried up the dinner, being, as he
said, very desirous to see his young lady; he made therefore no
scruple of keeping his master standing above ten minutes, while
civilities were passing between him and sophia, for which he received
only a good-humoured rebuke at the door when he returned.

the eggs of pullets, partridges, pheasants, &c., were, as george well
knew, the most favourite dainties of sophia. it was therefore no
wonder that he, who was a very good-natured fellow, should take care
to supply her with this kind of delicacy, at a time when all the
servants in the house were afraid she would be starved; for she had
scarce swallowed a single morsel in the last forty hours.

metamorphosed, that bears letters on its leaves, which virgil
recommended as a miracle to the royal society of his day; but no age
nor nation hath ever recorded a bird with a letter in its maw.

but though a miracle of this kind might have engaged all the
_académies des sciences_ in europe, and perhaps in a fruitless
enquiry; yet the reader, by barely recollecting the last dialogue
which passed between messieurs jones and partridge, will be very
easily satisfied from whence this letter came, and how it found its
passage into the fowl.

sophia, notwithstanding her long fast, and notwithstanding her
favourite dish was there before her, no sooner saw the letter than she
immediately snatched it up, tore it open, and read as follows:--

an end to the
conversation by ordering chairs to be called. i say luckily, for had
it continued much longer, fresh matter of dissension would, most
probably, have arisen between the brother and sister; between whom
education and sex made the only difference; for both were equally
violent and equally positive: they had both a vast affection for
sophia, and both a sovereign contempt for each other.



chapter v.

in which jones receives a letter from sophia, and goes to a play with
mrs miller and partridge.


the arrival of black george in town, and the good offices which that
grateful fellow had promised to do for his old benefactor, greatly
comforted jones in the midst of all the anxiety and uneasiness which
he had suffered on the account of sophia; from whom, by the means of
the said george, he received the following answer to his letter, which
sophia, to whom the use of pen, ink, and paper was restored with her
liberty, wrote the very evening when she departed from her
confinement:

  “sir,
 
 ___________________________
 
of such lover. hence, therefore, i conclude
that this affection is in nature, though i cannot pretend to say i
have ever seen an instance of it.

mr jones having spent three hours in reading and kissing the aforesaid
letter, and being, at last, in a state of good spirits, from the
last-mentioned considerations, he agreed to carry an appointment,
which he had before made, into execution. this was, to attend mrs
miller, and her younger daughter, into the gallery at the play-house,
and to admit mr partridge as one of the company. for as jones had
really that taste for humour which many affect, he expected to enjoy
much entertainment in the criticisms of partridge, from whom he
expected the simple dictates of nature, unimproved, indeed, but
likewise unadulterated, by art.

in the first row then of the first gallery did mr jones, mrs miller,
her youngest daughter, and partridge, take their places. partridge
immediately declared it was the finest place he had ever been in. when
the first music was pl

me, without putting one another out.”
 while the fellow was lighting the upper candles, he cried out to mrs
miller, “look, look, madam, the very picture of the man in the end of
the common-prayer book before the gunpowder-treason service.” nor
could he help observing, with a sigh, when all the candles were
lighted, “that here were candles enough burnt in one night, to keep an
honest poor family for a whole twelvemonth.”

as soon as the play, which was hamlet, prince of denmark, began,
partridge was all attention, nor did he break silence till the
entrance of the ghost; upon which he asked jones, “what man that was
in the strange dress; something,” said he, “like what i have seen in a
picture. sure it is not armour, is it?” jones answered, “that is the
ghost.” to which partridge replied with a smile, “persuade me to that,
sir, if you can. though i can’t say i ever actually saw a ghost in my
life, yet i am certain i should know one, if i saw him, better than
that comes t

o. no, no, sir, ghosts don’t appear in such dresses as
that, neither.” in this mistake, which caused much laughter in the
neighbourhood of partridge, he was suffered to continue, till the
scene between the ghost and hamlet, when partridge gave that credit to
mr garrick, which he had denied to jones, and fell into so violent a
trembling, that his knees knocked against each other. jones asked him
what was the matter, and whether he was afraid of the warrior upon the
stage? “o la! sir,” said he, “i perceive now it is what you told me. i
am not afraid of anything; for i know it is but a play. and if it was
really a ghost, it could do one no harm at such a distance, and in so
much company; and yet if i was frightened, i am not

never saw
any man frightened in my life. ay, ay: go along with you: ay, to be
sure! who’s fool then? will you? lud have mercy upon such
fool-hardiness!--whatever happens, it is good enough for
you.----follow you? i’d follow the devil as soon. nay, perhaps it is
the devil----for they say he can put on what likeness he pleases.--oh!
here he is again.----no farther! no, you have gone far enough already;
farther than i’d have gone for all the king’s dominions.” jones
offered to speak, but partridge cried “hush, hush! dear sir, don’t you
hear him?” and during the whole speech of the ghost, he sat with his
eyes fixed partly on the ghost and partly on hamlet, and with his
mouth open; the same passions which succeeded each other in hamlet,
succeeding likewise in him.

when the scene was over jones said, “why, partridge, you exceed my
expectations. you enjoy the play more than i conceived possible.”
 “nay, sir,” answered partridge, “if you are not afraid of the devil, i
can’t
 
 ___________________________
 
 help it; but to be sure, it is natural to be surprized at such
things, though i know there is nothing in them: not that it was the
ghost that surprized me, neither; for i should have known that to have
been only a man in a strange dress; but when i saw the little man so
frightened himself, it was that which took hold of me.” “and dost thou
imagine, then, partridge,” cries jones, “that he was really
frightened?” “nay, sir,” said partridge, “did not you yourself observe
afterwards, when he found it was his own father’s spirit, and how he
was murdered in the garden, how his fear forsook him by degrees, and
he was struck dumb with sorrow, as it were, just as i should have
been, had it been my own case?--but hush! o la! what noise is that?
there he is again.----well, to be certain, though i know there is
nothing at all in it, i am glad i am not down yonder, where those men
are.” then turning his eyes again upon hamlet, “ay, 
 
 ___________________________
 
you may draw your
sword; what signifies a sword against the power of the devil?”

during the second act, partridge made very few remarks. he greatly
admired the fineness of the dresses; nor could he help observing upon
the king’s countenance. “well,” said he, “how people may be deceived
by faces! _nulla fides fronti_ is, i find, a true saying. who would
think, by looking in the king’s face, that he had ever committed a
murder?” he then enquired after the ghost; but jones, who intended he
should be surprized, gave him no other satisfaction, than, “that he
might possibly see him again soon, and 
 
 ___________________________
 
in a flash of fire.”

partridge sat in a fearful expectation of this; and now, when the
ghost made his next appearance, partridge cried out, “there, sir, now;
what say you now? is he frightened now or no? as much frightened as
you think me, and, to be sure, nobody can help some fears. i would not
be in so bad a condition as what’s his name, squire hamlet, is there,
for all the world. bless me! what’s become of the spirit? as i am a
living soul, i thought i saw him sink into the earth.” “indeed, you
saw right,” answered jones. “well, well,” cries partridge, “i know it
is only a play: and besides, if there

to bless himself that he had never committed murder.
then turning to mrs miller, he asked her, “if she did not imagine the
king looked as if he was touched; though he is,” said he, “a good
actor, and doth all he can to hide it. well, i would not have so much
to answer for, as that wicked man there hath, to sit upon a much
higher chair than he sits upon. no wonder he ran away; for your sake
i’ll never trust an innocent face again.”

the grave-digging scene next engaged the attention of partridge, who
expressed much surprize at the number of skulls thrown upon the stage.
to which jones answered, “that it was one of the most famous
burial-places about town.” “no wonder then,” cries partridge, “that
the place is haunted. but i never saw in my life a worse grave-digger.
i had a sexton, when i was clerk, that should have dug three graves
while he is digging one. the fellow handles a spade as if it was the
first time he had ever had one in his hand. ay, ay, you may sing. you
had ra

ied out, “well! it is strange to see how fearless some men
are: i never could bring myself to touch anything belonging to a dead
man, on any account.--he seemed frightened enough too at the ghost, i
thought. _nemo omnibus horis sapit._”

little more worth remembering occurred during the play, at the end of
which jones asked him, “which of the players he had liked best?” to
this he answered, with some appearance of indignation at the question,
“the king, without doubt.” “indeed, mr partridge,” says mrs miller,
“you are not of the same opinion with the town; for they are all
agreed, that hamlet is acted by the best player who ever was on the
stage.” “he the best player!” cries partridge, with a contemptuous
sneer, “why, i could act as well as he myself. i am sure, if i had
seen a ghost, i should have looked in the very same manner, and done
just as he did. and then, to be sure, in that scene, as you called it,
between him and his mother, where you told me he acted so fin

but indeed, madam, though i was never at a play in london, yet i have
seen acting before in the country; and the king for my money; he
speaks all his words distinctly, half as loud again as the
other.--anybody may see he is an actor.”

while mrs miller was thus engaged in conversation with partridge, a
lady came up to mr jones, whom he immediately knew to be mrs
fitzpatrick. she said, she had seen him from the other part of the
gallery, and had taken that opportunity of speaking to him, as she had
something to say, which might be of great service to himself. she then
acquainted him with her lodgings, and made him an appointment the next
day in the morning; which, upon recollection, she presently changed to
the afternoon; at which time jones promised to attend her.

thus ended the adventure

 at the playhouse; where partridge had
afforded great mirth, not only to jones and mrs miller, but to all who
sat within hearing, who were more attentive to what he said, than to
anything that passed on the stage.

he durst not go to bed all that night, for fear of the ghost; and for
many nights after sweated two or three hours before he went to sleep,
with the same apprehensions, and waked several times in great horrors,
crying out, “lord have mercy upon us! there it is.”

blifil, having obtained this unhoped-for acquiescence in his uncle,
rested not till he carried his purpose into execution. and as no
immediate business required mr allworthy’s presence in the country,
and little preparation is necessary to men for a journey, they set out
the very next day, and arrived in town that evening, when mr jones, as
we have seen, was diverting himself with partridge at the play.

the morning after his arrival mr blifil waited on mr western, by whom
he was most kindly and graciously received, and from whom he had every
possible assurance (perhaps more than was possible) that he should
very shortly be as happy as sophia could make him; nor would the
squire suffer the young gentleman to return to his uncle till he had,
almost against his will, carried him to his sister.

fore a justice. he answered,
“wherever you please; i am indifferent as to what happens to me; for
though i am convinced i am not guilty of murder in the eye of the law,
yet the weight of blood i find intolerable upon my mind.”

jones was now conducted before the justice, where the surgeon who
dressed mr fitzpatrick appeared, and deposed that he believed the
wound to be mortal; upon which the prisoner was committed to the
gatehouse. it was very late at night, so that jones would not send for
partridge till the next morning; and, as he never shut his eyes till
seven, so it was near twelve before the poor fellow, who was greatly
frightened at not hearing from his master so long, received a message
which almost deprived him of his being when he heard it.

he went to the gatehouse with trembling knees and a beating heart, and
was no sooner arrived in the presence of jones than he lamented the
misfortune that had befallen him with many tears, looking all the
while frequently about him in great te

chapter v.

mrs miller and mr nightingale visit jones in the prison.


when mr allworthy and his nephew went to meet mr western, mrs miller
set forwards to her son-in-law’s lodgings, in order to acquaint him
with the accident which had befallen his friend jones; but he had
known it long before from partridge (for jones, when he left mrs
miller, had been furnished with a room in the same house with mr
nightingale). the good woman found her daughter under great affliction
on account of mr jones, whom having comforted as well as she could,
she set forwards to the gatehouse, where she heard he was, and where
mr nightingale was arrived before her.

the firmness and constancy of a true friend is a circumstance so
extremely delightful to persons in any kind of distress, that the
distress itself, if it be 
 
 ___________________________
 
known very few absolutely exempt. but enough of a
subject which, if pursued, would lead me too far.

whether it was that fortune was apprehensive lest jones should sink
under the weight of his adversity, and that she might thus lose any
future opportunity of tormenting him, or whether she really abated
somewhat of her severity towards him, she seemed a little to relax her
persecution, by sending him the company of two such faithful friends,
and what is perhaps more rare, a faithful servant. for partridge,
though he had many imperfections, wanted not fidelity; and though fear
would not suffer him to be hanged for his master, yet the world, i
believe, could not have bribed him to desert his cause.

while jones was expressing great satisfaction in the presence of his
friends, partridge brought an account that mr fitzpatrick was still
alive, though the surgeon declared that he had very little hopes. upon
which, jones fetching a deep sigh, nightingale said to him, “my dear
tom, why should you affl
 
 ___________________________
 
so he
shall acknowledge too, before i have done with him.”

jones gravely answered, “that whatever might be his fate, he
should always lament the having shed the blood of one of his
fellow-creatures, as one of the highest misfortunes which could
have befallen him. but i have another misfortune of the tenderest
kind----o! mrs miller, i have lost what i held most dear upon earth.”
 “that must be a mistress,” said mrs miller; “but come, come; i know
more than you imagine” (for indeed partridge had blabbed all); “and i
have heard more than you know. matters go better, i promise you, than
you think; and i would not give blifil sixpence for all the chance
which he hath of the lady.”

“indeed, my dear friend, indeed,” answered jones, “you are an entire
stranger to the cause of my grief. if you was acquainted with the
story, you would allow my case admitted of no comfort. i apprehend no
danger from blifil. i have undone myself.” “don’t despair,” replied
mrs miller; “yo
 
 ___________________________
 
 and now the
remainder of the conversation past in the joint attempts of that good
woman and mr nightingale to cheer the dejected spirits of mr jones, in
which they so far succeeded as to leave him much better comforted and
satisfied than they found him; to which happy alteration nothing so
much contributed as the kind undertaking of mrs miller to deliver his
letter to sophia, which he despaired of finding any means to
accomplish; for when black george produced the last from sophia, he
informed partridge that she had strictly charged him, on pain of
having it communicated to her father, not to bring her any answer. he
was, moreover, not a little pleased to find he had so warm an advocate
to mr allworthy himself in this good woman, who was, in reality, one
of the worthiest creatures in the world.

after about an hour’s visit from the lady (for nightingale had been
with him much longer), they both took their leave, promising to return
to him soon; during which mrs miller said she hoped to bring

chapter vii.

a pathetic scene between mr allworthy and mrs miller.


mrs miller had a long discourse with mr allworthy, at his return from
dinner, in which she acquainted him with jones’s having unfortunately
lost all which he was pleased to bestow on him at their separation;
and with the distresses to which that loss had subjected him; of all
which she had received a full account from the faithful retailer
partridge. she then explained the obligations she had to jones; not
that she was entirely explicit with regard to her daughter; for though
she had the utmost confidence in mr allworthy, and though there could
be no hopes of keeping an affair secret which was unhappily known to
more than half a dozen, yet she could not prevail with herself to
mention those circumstances which reflected most on the chastity of
poor nancy, but smothered that part of her evidence as cautiously as
if she had been before a jud

sophia remonstrated all she could; but her aunt was deaf to all she
said. in this resolution therefore we must at present leave her, as
there seems to be no hopes of bringing her to change it.



chapter ix.

what happened to mr jones in the prison.


mr jones passed about twenty-four melancholy hours by himself, unless
when relieved by the company of partridge, before mr nightingale
returned; not that this worthy young man had deserted or forgot his
friend; for, indeed, he had been much the greatest part of the time
employed in his service.

he had heard, upon enquiry, that the only persons who had seen the
beginning of the unfortunate rencounter were a crew belonging to a
man-of-war which then lay at deptford. to deptford therefore he went
in search of this crew, where he was informed that the men he sought
after were all gone ashore. he then traced
 
 ___________________________
 
 them from place to place,
till at last he found two of them drinking together, with a third
person, at a hedge-tavern near aldersgate.

nightingale desired to speak with jones by himself (for partridge was
in the room when he came in). as soon as they were alone, nightingale,
taking jones by the hand, cried, “come, my brave friend, be not too
much dejected at what i am going to tell you----i am sorry i am the
messenger of bad news; but i think it my duty to tell you.” “i guess
already what that bad news is,” cries jones. “the poor gentleman then
is dead.”--“i hope not,” answered nightingale. “he was alive this
morning; though i will not flatter you; i fear, from the accounts

the period may be of my own performances, they will most probably

abusive contemporaries.



chapter ii.

containing a very tragical incident.


while jones was employed in those unpleasant meditations, with which
we left him tormenting himself, partridge came stumbling into the room
with his face paler than ashes, his eyes fixed in his head, his hair
standing an end, and every limb trembling. in short, he looked as
he would have done had he seen a spectre, or had he, indeed, been a
spectre himself.

jones, who was little subject to fear, could not avoid being somewhat
shocked at this sudden appearance. he did, indeed, himself change
colour, and his voice a little faultered while he asked him, what was
the matter?

“i hope, sir,” said partri

dge, “you will not be angry with me. indeed
i did not listen, but i was obliged to stay in the outward room. i am
sure i wish i had been a hundred miles off, rather than have heard
what i have heard.” “why, what is the matter?” said jones. “the
matter, sir? o good heaven!” answered partridge, “was that woman who
is just gone out the woman who was with you at upton?” “she was,
partridge,” cried jones. “and did you really, sir, go to bed with that
woman?” said he, trembling.--“i am afraid what past between us is no
secret,” said jones.--“nay, but pray, sir, for heaven’s sake, sir,
answer me,” cries partridge. “you know i did,” cries jones. “why then,
the lord have mercy upon your soul, and forgive you,” cries partridge;
“but as sure as i stand here alive, you have been a-bed with your own
mother.”

upon these words jones became in a moment a greater

picture of horror
than partridge himself. he was, indeed, for some time struck dumb with
amazement, and both stood staring wildly at each other. at last his
words found way, and in an interrupted voice he said, “how! how!
what’s this you tell me?” “nay, sir,” cries partridge, “i have not
breath enough left to tell you now, but what i have said is most
certainly true.--that woman who now went out is your own mother. how
unlucky was it for you, sir, that i did not happen to see her at that
time, to have prevented it! sure the devil himself must have contrived
to bring about this wickedness.”

“sure,” cries jones, “fortune will never have done with me till she
hath driven me to distraction. but why do i blame fortune? i am myself
the cause of all my misery.

all the dreadful mischiefs which have
befallen me are the consequences only of my own folly and vice. what
thou hast told me, partridge, hath almost deprived me of my senses!
and was mrs waters, then--but why do i ask? for thou must certainly
know her--if thou hast any affection for me, nay, if thou hast any
pity, let me beseech thee to fetch this miserable woman back again to
me. o good heavens! incest----with a mother! to what am i reserved!”
 he then fell into the most violent and frantic agonies of grief and
despair, in which partridge declared he would not leave him; but at
last, having vented the first torrent of passio

n, he came a little to
himself; and then, having acquainted partridge that he would find this
wretched woman in the same house where the wounded gentleman was
lodged, he despatched him in quest of her.

if the reader will please to refresh his memory, by turning to the
scene at upton, in the ninth book, he will be apt to admire the many
strange accidents which unfortunately prevented any interview between
partridge and mrs waters, when she spent a whole day there with mr
jones. instances of this kind we may frequently observe in life, where
the greatest events are produced by a nice train of little
circumstances; and more than one example of this may be discovered by
the accurate eye, in this our history.

after a fruitless search of two or three hours, partridge returned
back to his master, without having seen mrs waters. jones, who was in
a state of desperation at his delay, was almost raving mad when h

                                     “j. waters.”

  “p.s. i would have you comfort yourself as much as possible, for mr
  fitzpatrick is in no manner of danger; so that whatever other
  grievous crimes you may have to repent of, the guilt of blood is not
  among the number.”

jones having read the letter, let it drop (for he was unable to hold
it, and indeed had scarce the use of any one of his faculties).
partridge took it up, and having received consent by silence, read it
likewise; nor had it upon him a less sensible effect. the pencil, and
not the pen, should describe the horrors which appeared in both their
countenances. while they both remained speechless the turnkey entered
the room, and, without taking any notice of what sufficiently
discovered itself in the faces of them both, acquainted jones that a
man without desired to speak with him. this person was presently
introduced, and was no other than

he had not the least
want of that kind.” upon which george began to press his services more
eagerly than before. jones again thanked him, with assurances that he
wanted nothing which was in the power of any man living to give.
“come, come, my good master,” answered george, “do not take the matter
so much to heart. things may end better than you imagine; to be sure
you an’t the first gentleman who hath killed a man, and yet come off.”
 “you are wide of the matter, george,” said partridge, “the gentleman
is not dead, nor like to die. don’t disturb my master, at present, for
he is troubled about a matter in which it is not in your power to do
him any good.” “you don’t know what i may be able to do, mr
partridge,” answered george; “if his concern is about my young lady, i
have some news to tell my master.” “what do you say, mr george?” cried
jones. “hath anything lately happened in which my sophia is concerned?
my sophia! how dares such a wretch as i mention

but they must have a great deal of good-nature, and be well acquainted
with friendship, who can feel what she felt on this occasion. few, i
hope, are capable of feeling what now passed in the mind of blifil;
but those who are will acknowledge that it was impossible for him to
raise any objection to this visit. fortune, however, or the gentleman
lately mentioned above, stood his friend, and prevented his undergoing
so great a shock; for at the very instant when the coach was sent for,
partridge arrived, and, having called mrs miller from the company,
acquainted her with the dreadful accident lately come to light; and
hearing mr allworthy’s intention, begged her to find some means of
stopping him: “for,” says he, “the matter must at all hazards be kept
a secret from him; and if he should now go, he will find mr jones and
his mother, who arrived just as i left him, lamenting over one another
the horrid crime they have ignorantly committed.”

the poor woman, who was almost depr

es which have lately befallen this poor young fellow must
have thrown him into the lowest dejection of spirits; and now, sir,
should we all on a sudden fling him into such a violent fit of joy, as
i know your presence will occasion, it may, i am afraid, produce some
fatal mischief, especially as his servant, who is without, tells me he
is very far from being well.”

“is his servant without?” cries allworthy; “pray call him hither. i
will ask him some questions concerning his master.”

partridge was at first afraid to appear before mr allworthy; but was
at length persuaded, after mrs miller, who had often heard his whole
story from his own mouth, had promised to introduce him.

allworthy recollected partridge the moment he came into the room,
though many years had passed since he had seen him. mrs miller,
therefore, might have spared here a formal oration, in which, indeed,
she was something prolix; for the reader, i believe, may have observed
already that the good woman, among other t

hings, had a tongue always
ready for the service of her friends.

“and are you,” said allworthy to partridge, “the servant of mr jones?”
 “i can’t say, sir,” answered he, “that i am regularly a servant, but i
live with him, an’t please your honour, at present. _non sum qualis
eram_, as your honour very well knows.”

mr allworthy then asked him many questions concerning jones, as to his
health, and other matters; to all which partridge answered, without
having the least regard to what was, but considered only what he would
have things appear; for a strict adherence to truth was not among the
articles of this honest fellow’s morality or his religion.

during this dialogue mr nightingale took his leave, and presently
after mrs miller left the room, when allworthy likewise despatched
blifil; for he imagined that partridge when alone with him would be
more explicit than before company. they were no sooner left in private

“sure, friend,” said the good man, “you are the strangest of all human
beings. not only to have suffered as you have formerly for obstinately
persisting in a falshood, but to persist in it thus to the last, and
to pass thus upon the world for a servant of your own son! what
interest can you have in all this? what can be your motive?”

“i see, sir,” said partridge, falling down upon his knees, “that your
honour is prepossessed against me, and resolved not to believe
anything i say, and, therefore, what signifies my protestations? but
yet there is one above who knows that i am not the father of this
young man.”

“how!” said allworthy, “will you yet deny what you was formerly
convicted of upon such unanswerable, such manifest evidence? nay, what
a confirmation is your being now found with this very man, of all
which twenty years ago appeared agai

nst you! i thought you had left
the country! nay, i thought you had been long since dead.--in what
manner did you know anything of this young man? where did you meet
with him, unless you had kept some correspondence together? do not
deny this; for i promise you it will greatly raise your son in my
opinion, to find that he hath such a sense of filial duty as privately
to support his father for so many years.”

“if your honour will have patience to hear me,” said partridge, “i
will tell you all.”--being bid go on, he proceeded thus: “when your
honour conceived that displeasure against me, it ended in my ruin soon
after; for i lost my little school; and the minister, thinking i
suppose it would be agreeable to your honour, turned me out from the
office of clerk; so that i had nothing to trust to but the barber’s
shop, which, in a country place like that, is a poor livelihood; and
when my wife died (for till that time i received a pension of £12 a
year fro

s salisbury, where i got into the service
of a gentleman belonging to the law, and one of the best gentlemen
that ever i knew, for he was not only good to me, but i know a
thousand good and charitable acts which he did while i staid with him;
and i have known him often refuse business because it was paultry and
oppressive.” “you need not be so particular,” said allworthy; “i know
this gentleman, and a very worthy man he is, and an honour to his
profession.”--“well, sir,” continued partridge, “from hence i removed
to lymington, where i was above three years in the service of another
lawyer, who was likewise a very good sort of a man, and to be sure one
of the merriest gentlemen in england. well, sir, at the end of the
three years i set up a little school, and was likely to do well again,
had it not been for a most unlucky accident. here i kept a pig; and
one day, as ill fortune would have it, this pig broke out, and did a
trespass, i think they call it, in a garden belonging to o

drive my hogs into other folk’s gardens, and a great deal more; and at
last he said, he hoped i had at last brought my hogs to a fair market.
to be sure, one would have thought that, instead of being owner only
of one poor little pig, i had been the greatest hog-merchant in
england. well--” “pray,” said allworthy, “do not be so particular, i
have heard nothing of your son yet.” “o it was a great many years,”
 answered partridge, “before i saw my son, as you are pleased to call
him.----i went over to ireland after this, and taught school at cork
(for that one suit ruined me again, and i lay seven years in
winchester jail).”--“well,” said allworthy, “pass that over till your
return to england.”--“then, sir,” said he, “it was about half a year
ago that i landed at bristol, where i staid some time, and not finding
it do there, and hearing of a place between that and gloucester where
the barber was just d

 he had for
allworthy. he concluded with saying, “now, sir, i have told your
honour the whole truth.” and then repeated a most solemn protestation,
“that he was no more the father of jones than of the pope of rome;”
 and imprecated the most bitter curses on his head, if he did not speak
truth.

“what am i to think of this matter?” cries allworthy. “for what
purpose should you so strongly deny a fact which i think it would be
rather your interest to own?” “nay, sir,” answered partridge (for he
could hold no longer), “if your honour will not believe me, you are
like soon to have satisfaction enough. i wish you had mistaken the
mother of this young man, as well as you have his father.”--and now
being asked what he meant, with all the symptoms of horror, both in
his voice and countenance, he told allworthy the whole story, which he
had a little before expressed such desire to mrs miller to conceal
from him.

allworthy was almost as much shocked at this discovery as partridge

himself had been while he related it. “good heavens!” says he, “in
what miserable distresses do vice and imprudence involve men! how much
beyond our designs are the effects of wickedness sometimes carried!”
 he had scarce uttered these words, when mrs waters came hastily and
abruptly into the room. partridge no sooner saw her than he cried,
“here, sir, here is the very woman herself. this is the unfortunate
mother of mr jones. i am sure she will acquit me before your honour.
pray, madam----”

mrs waters, without paying any regard to what partridge said, and
almost without taking any notice of him, advanced to mr allworthy. “i
believe, sir, it is so long since i had the honour of seeing you, that
you do not recollect me.” “indeed,” answered allworthy, “you are so
very much altered, on

many accounts, that had not this man already
acquainted me who you are, i should not have immediately called you to
my remembrance. have you, madam, any particular business which brings
you to me?” allworthy spoke this with great reserve; for the reader
may easily believe he was not well pleased with the conduct of this
lady; neither with what he had formerly heard, nor with what partridge
had now delivered.

mrs waters answered--“indeed, sir, i have very particular business
with you; and it is such as i can impart only to yourself. i must
desire, therefore, the favour of a word with you alone: for i assure
you what i have to tell you is of the utmost importance.”

partridge was then ordered to withdraw, but before he went, he begged
the lady to satisfy mr allworthy that he was perfectly innocent. to
which she answered, “you need be under no apprehension, sir; i shall
satis

then partridge withdrew, and that past between mr allworthy and mrs
waters which is written in the next chapter.

mrs waters remaining a few moments silent, mr allworthy could not
refrain from saying, “i am sorry, madam, to perceive, by what i have
since heard, that you have made so very ill a use----” “mr allworthy,”
 says she, interrupting him, “i know i have faults, but ingratitude to
you is not one of them. i never can nor shall forget your goodness

 proposed no such matter; he only said,
taking me for mr fitzpatrick’s wife, that, if mr jones had murdered my
husband, i should be assisted with any money i wanted to carry on the
prosecution, by a very worthy gentleman, who, he said, was well
apprized what a villain i had to deal with. it was by this man i found
out who mr jones was; and this man, whose name is dowling, mr jones
tells me is your steward. i discovered his name by a very odd
accident; for he himself refused to tell it me; but partridge, who met
him at my lodgings the second time he came, knew him formerly at
salisbury.”

“and did this mr dowling,” says allworthy, with great astonishment
in his countenance, “tell you that i would assist in the
prosecution?”--“no, sir,” answered she, “i will not charge him
wrongfully. he said i should be assisted, but he mentioned no name.
yet you must pardon me, sir, if from circumstances i thought it could
be no other.”--“indeed, madam,” says allworthy, “from circumsta

lacker crime, such as cruelty,
murder, ingratitude, or the like, compassion and forgiveness then
become faults. i am convinced the fellow is a villain, and he shall be
punished; at least as far as i can punish him.”

this was spoken with so stern a voice, that jones did not think proper
to make any reply; besides, the hour appointed by mr western now drew
so near, that he had barely time left to dress himself. here therefore
ended the present dialogue, and jones retired to another room, where
partridge attended, according to order, with his cloaths.

partridge had scarce seen his master since the happy discovery. the
poor fellow was unable either to contain or express his transports. he
behaved like one frantic, and made almost as many mistakes while he
was dressing jones as i have seen made by harlequin in dressing
himself on the stage.

his memory, however, was not in the least deficient. he recollected
now many omens and presages of this happy event, some of which he had
remarked at the ti

 subsists between the two families.

as to those of lower account, mrs waters returned into the country,
had a pension of £60 a-year settled upon her by mr allworthy, and is
married to parson supple, on whom, at the instance of sophia, western
hath bestowed a considerable living.

black george, hearing the discovery that had been made, ran away, and
was never since heard of; and jones bestowed the money on his family,
but not in equal proportions, for molly had much the greatest share.

as for partridge, jones hath settled £50 a-year on him; and he hath
again set up a school, in which he meets with much better
encouragement than formerly, and there is now a treaty of marriage on
foot between him and miss molly seagrim, which, through the mediation
of sophia, is likely to take effect.

we now return to take leave of mr jones and sophia, who, within two
days after their marriage, attended mr western and mr allworthy into
the country. western hath resigned his family seat, and the greater
part o
