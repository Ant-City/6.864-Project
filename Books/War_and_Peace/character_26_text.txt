 could not be sure
whether what he said was very witty or very stupid. he was dressed in
a dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe
effrayée, as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings.

the vicomte told his tale very neatly. it was an anecdote, then current,
to the effect that the duc d’enghien had gone secretly to paris to visit
mademoiselle george; that at her house he came upon bonaparte, who also
enjoyed the famous actress’ favors, and that in his presence napoleon
happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was subject,
and was thus at the duc’s mercy. the latter spared him, and this
magnanimity bonaparte subsequently repaid by death.

the story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the point
where the rivals suddenly recognized one another; and the ladies looked
agitated.

“charming!” said anna pávlovna with an inquiring glance at the little
princess.

“charming!” whispered the little princess, sticking the needle into

the buonapartists who say that,” replied the vicomte without
looking at pierre. “at the present time it is difficult to know the real
state of french public opinion.”

“bonaparte has said so,” remarked prince andrew with a sarcastic smile.

it was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his
remarks at him, though without looking at him.

“‘i showed them the path to glory, but they did not follow it,’” prince
andrew continued after a short silence, again quoting napoleon’s words.
“‘i opened my antechambers and they crowded in.’ i do not know how far
he was justified in saying so.”

“not in the least,” replied the vicomte. “after the murder of the
duc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero. if to some
people,” he went on, turning to anna pávlovna, “he ever was a hero,
after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one
hero less on earth.”

before anna pávlovna and the others had time to smile their appre

of the vicomte’s epigram, pierre again broke into the conversation, and
though anna pávlovna felt sure he would say something inappropriate, she
was unable to stop him.

“the execution of the duc d’enghien,” declared monsieur pierre, “was a
political necessity, and it seems to me that napoleon showed greatness
of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole responsibility of
that deed.”

“dieu! mon dieu!” muttered anna pávlovna in a terrified whisper.

“what, monsieur pierre... do you consider that assassination shows
greatness of soul?” said the little princess, smiling and drawing her
work nearer to her.

“oh! oh!” exclaimed several voices.

“capital!” said prince hippolyte in english, and began slapping his knee
with the palm of his hand.

the vicomte merely

 shrugged his shoulders. pierre looked solemnly at his
audience over his spectacles and continued.

“i say so,” he continued desperately, “because the bourbons fled
from the revolution leaving the people to anarchy, and napoleon alone
understood the revolution and quelled it, and so for the general good,
he could not stop short for the sake of one man’s life.”

“won’t you come over to the other table?” suggested anna pávlovna.

but pierre continued his speech without heeding her.

“no,” cried he, becoming more and more eager, “napoleon is great because
he rose superior to the revolution, suppressed its abuses, preserved all
that was good in it—equality of citizenship and freedom of speech and of

... but
won’t you come to this other table?” repeated anna pávlovna.

“rousseau’s contrat social,” said the vicomte with a tolerant smile.

“i am not speaking of regicide, i am speaking about ideas.”

“yes: ideas of robbery, murder, and regicide,” again interjected an
ironical voice.

“those were extremes, no doubt, but they are not what is most important.
what is important are the rights of man, emancipation from prejudices,
and equality of citizenship, and all these ideas napoleon has retained
in full force.”

“liberty and equality,” said the vicomte contemptuously, as if at last
deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words were,
“high-sounding words which have long been discredited. who does not love
liberty and equality? even our saviour preached liberty and equality.
have people since the revolution become happier? on the contrary. we
wanted liberty, but buonaparte has destroyed it.”

prince andrew kept looking with an amused smile from pi

m for the first time saw clearly that
this young jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested. all were
silent.

“how do you expect him to answer you all at once?” said prince andrew.
“besides, in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish between
his acts as a private person, as a general, and as an emperor. so it
seems to me.”

“yes, yes, of course!” pierre chimed in, pleased at the arrival of this
reinforcement.

“one must admit,” continued prince andrew, “that napoleon as a man was
great on the bridge of arcola, and in the hospital at jaffa where he
gave his hand to the plague-stricken; but ... but there are other acts
which it is difficult to justify.”

prince andrew, who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of
pierre’s remarks, rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to
go.

suddenly prince hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend,
and asking them all to be seated began:

eady been choosing a career for three months, and had not decided
on anything. it was about this choice that prince andrew was speaking.
pierre rubbed his forehead.

“but he must be a freemason,” said he, referring to the abbé whom he had
met that evening.

“that is all nonsense.” prince andrew again interrupted him, “let us
talk business. have you been to the horse guards?”

“no, i have not; but this is what i have been thinking and wanted to
tell you. there is a war now against napoleon. if it were a war for
freedom i could understand it and should be the first to enter the army;
but to help england and austria against the greatest man in the world is
not right.”

prince andrew only shrugged his shoulders at pierre’s childish words. he
put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsense,
but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other answer than
the one prince andrew gave to this naïve question.

“if no one fought except on his own convic

g occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wall,
as if running a sword through an invisible foe, and glaring savagely
over his spectacles, and then again resuming his walk, muttering
indistinct words, shrugging his shoulders and gesticulating.

“england is done for,” said he, scowling and pointing his finger at
someone unseen. “mr. pitt, as a traitor to the nation and to the
rights of man, is sentenced to...” but before pierre—who at that moment
imagined himself to be napoleon in person and to have just effected the
dangerous crossing of the straits of dover and captured london—could
pronounce pitt’s sentence, he saw a well-built and handsome young
officer entering his room. pierre paused. he had left moscow when borís
was a boy of fourteen, and had quite forgotten him, but in his usual
impulsive and hearty way he took borís by the hand with a friendly
smile.

“do you remember me?” asked borís quietly with a pleasant smile. “i have
come with my mother to

stic smile. “i am borís, son of princess anna mikháylovna
drubetskáya. rostóv, the father, is ilyá, and his son is nicholas. i

pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees.

“oh dear, what am i thinking about? i’ve mixed everything up. one has so
many relatives in moscow! so you are borís? of course. well, now we
know where we are. and what do you think of the boulogne expedition?
the english will come off badly, you know, if napoleon gets across the
channel. i think the expedition is quite feasible. if only villeneuve
doesn’t make a mess of things!”

borís knew nothing about the boulogne expedition; he did not read the
papers and it was the first time he had heard villeneuve’s name.

“we here in moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal
than with politics,” said he in his quiet ironical tone. “i know nothing
about it and have not thought about it. moscow is chiefly busy with
gossip,” he continu

am very glad to have made your acquaintance. it’s queer,” he added after
a pause, “that you should have suspected me!” he began to laugh. “well,
what of it! i hope we’ll get better acquainted,” and he pressed borís’
hand. “do you know, i have not once been in to see the count. he has not
sent for me.... i am sorry for him as a man, but what can one do?”

“and so you think napoleon will manage to get an army across?” asked
borís with a smile.

pierre saw that borís wished to change the subject, and being of the
same mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the
boulogne expedition.

a footman came in to summon borís—the princess was going. pierre, in
order to make borís’ better acquaintance, promised to come to dinner,
and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles
into borís’ eyes. after he had gone pierre continued

said: “that’s bad! go on, go on.”

the third interruption came when prince andrew was finishing his
description. the old man began to sing, in the cracked voice of old age:
“malbrook s’en va-t-en guerre. dieu sait quand reviendra.” *

     * “marlborough is going to the wars; god knows when he’ll
     return.”


his son only smiled.

“i don’t say it’s a plan i approve of,” said the son; “i am only telling
you what it is. napoleon has also formed his plan by now, not worse than
this one.”

“well, you’ve told me nothing new,” and the old man repeated,
meditatively and rapidly:

“dieu sait quand reviendra. go to the dining room.”

on november 1 kutúzov had received, through a spy, news that the army he
commanded was in an almost hopeless position. the spy reported that the
french, after crossing the bridge at vienna, were advancing in immense
force upon kutúzov’s line of communication with the troops that were
arriving from russia. if kutúzov decided to remain at krems, napoleon’s
army of one hundred and fifty thousand men would cut him off completely
and surround his exhausted army of forty thousand, and he would find
himself in the position of mack at ulm. if kutúzov decided to abandon
the road connecting him with the troops arriving from russia, he would
have to march with no road into unknown parts of the bohemian mountains,
defending himself against superior forces of the enemy and abandoning
all hope of a junction with buxhöwden. if kutúzov decided to retrea

bonaparte’s adjutant rode full gallop with this menacing letter to
murat. bonaparte himself, not trusting to his generals, moved with all
the guards to the field of battle, afraid of letting a ready victim
escape, and bagratión’s four thousand men merrily lighted campfires,
dried and warmed themselves, cooked their porridge for the first time
for three days, and not one of them knew or imagined what was in store
for him.

young had triumphed. the voices of those who counseled delay and advised
waiting for something else before advancing had been so completely
silenced and their arguments confuted by such conclusive evidence of the
advantages of attacking that what had been discussed at the council—the
coming battle and the victory that would certainly result from it—no
longer seemed to be in the future but in the past. all the advantages
were on our side. our enormous forces, undoubtedly superior to
napoleon’s, were concentrated in one place, the troops inspired by the
emperors’ presence were eager for action. the strategic position where
the operations would take place was familiar in all its details to
the austrian general weyrother: a lucky accident had ordained that the
austrian army should maneuver the previous year on the very fields where
the french had now to be fought; the adjacent locality was known and
shown in every detail on the maps, and bonaparte, evidently weakened,
was undertak

and wounded.

at daybreak on the seventeenth, a french officer who had come with
a flag of truce, demanding an audience with the russian emperor, was
brought into wischau from our outposts. this officer was savary. the
emperor had only just fallen asleep and so savary had to wait. at midday
he was admitted to the emperor, and an hour later he rode off with
prince dolgorúkov to the advanced post of the french army.

it was rumored that savary had been sent to propose to alexander
a meeting with napoleon. to the joy and pride of the whole army, a
personal interview was refused, and instead of the sovereign, prince
dolgorúkov, the victor at wischau, was sent with savary to negotiate
with napoleon if, contrary to expectations, these negotiations were
actuated by a real desire for peace.

toward evening dolgorúkov came back, went straight to the tsar, and
remained alone with him for a long time.

fears nothing so much as a general battle is impossible.”

“yes, you have seen him?” said prince andrew. “well, what is bonaparte
like? how did he impress you?”

“yes, i saw him, and am convinced that he fears nothing so much as a
general engagement,” repeated dolgorúkov, evidently prizing this general
conclusion which he had arrived at from his interview with napoleon.
“if he weren’t afraid of a battle why did he ask for that interview? why
negotiate, and above all why retreat, when to retreat is so contrary
to his method of conducting war? believe me, he is afraid, afraid of a
general battle. his hour has come! mark my words!”

“but tell me, what is he like, eh?” said prince andrew again.

“he is a man in a gray overcoat, very anxious that i should call him
‘your majesty,’ but who, to his chagrin, got no title from me! that’s

“what’s your name?”

“count rostóv.”

“oh, very well, you may stay in attendance on me.”

“count ilyá rostóv’s son?” asked dolgorúkov.

but rostóv did not reply.

“then i may reckon on it, your excellency?”

“i will give the order.”

“tomorrow very likely i may be sent with some message to the emperor,”
thought rostóv.

“thank god!”

the fires and shouting in the enemy’s army were occasioned by the fact
that while napoleon’s proclamation was being read to the troops the
emperor himself rode round his bivouacs. the soldiers, on seeing him,
lit wisps of straw and ran after him, shouting, “vive l’empereur!”
napoleon’s proclamation was as follows:

soldiers! the russian army is advancing against you to avenge the
austrian army of ulm. they are the same battalions you broke at
hollabrünn and have pursued ever since to this place. the position we
occupy is a strong one, and while they are marching to go roun

french troops who are being raised in france will join us, and the peace
i shall conclude will be worthy of my people, of you, and of myself.

at five in the morning it was still quite dark. the troops of the
center, the reserves, and bagratión’s right flank had not yet moved, but
on the left flank the columns of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, which
were to be the first to descend the heights to attack the french right
flank and drive it into the bohemian mountains according to plan, were
already up and astir. the smoke of the campfires, into which they were
throwing everything superfluous, made the eyes smart.

ich kutúzov was, stood on the

below, where the fight was beginning, there was still thick fog; on the
higher ground it was clearing, but nothing could be seen of what was
going on in front. whether all the enemy forces were, as we supposed,
six miles away, or whether they were near by in that sea of mist, no one
knew till after eight o’clock.

it was nine o’clock in the morning. the fog lay unbroken like a sea down
below, but higher up at the village of schlappanitz where napoleon stood
with his marshals around him, it was quite light. above him was a clear
blue sky, and the sun’s vast orb quivered like a huge hollow, crimson
float on the surface of that milky sea of mist. the whole french army,
and even napoleon himself with his staff, were not on the far side of
the streams and hollows of sokolnitz and schlappanitz beyond which we
intended to take up our position and begin the action, but were on this
side, so close to our own forces that napoleon with the naked eye

which he had worn on his italian campaign, sat on his small gray arab

which seemed to rise out of the sea of mist and on which the russian
troops were moving in the distance, and he listened to the sounds of
firing in the valley. not a single muscle of his face—which in those
days was still thin—moved. his gleaming eyes were fixed intently on one

now. but where am i?”

he listened and heard the sound of approaching horses, and voices
speaking french. he opened his eyes. above him again was the same lofty
sky with clouds that had risen and were floating still higher, and
between them gleamed blue infinity. he did not turn his head and did not
see those who, judging by the sound of hoofs and voices, had ridden up
and stopped near him.

it was napoleon accompanied by two aides-de-camp. bonaparte riding
over the battlefield had given final orders to strengthen the batteries
firing at the augesd dam and was looking at the killed and wounded left
on the field.

“fine men!” remarked napoleon, looking at a dead russian grenadier,
who, with his face buried in the ground and a blackened nape, lay on his
stomach with an already stiffened arm flung wide.

“the ammunition for the guns in position is exhausted, your majesty,”
said an adjutant wh

o had come from the batteries that were firing at
augesd.

“have some brought from the reserve,” said napoleon, and having gone on
a few steps he stopped before prince andrew, who lay on his back with
the flagstaff that had been dropped beside him. (the flag had already
been taken by the french as a trophy.)

“that’s a fine death!” said napoleon as he gazed at bolkónski.

prince andrew understood that this was said of him and that it was
napoleon who said it. he heard the speaker addressed as sire. but he
heard the words as he might have heard the buzzing of a fly. not only
did they not interest him, but he took no notice of them and at once
forgot them. his head was burning, he felt himself bleeding to death,
and he saw above him the remote, lofty, and everlasting sky. he knew it
was napoleon—his hero—but at that moment napoleon seemed to him such a
small, insignificant creature compared with what was passing now between

that moment it meant nothing to him who might be standing over him, or
what was said of him; he was only glad that people were standing near
him and only wished that they would help him and bring him back to
life, which seemed to him so beautiful now that he had today learned to
understand it so differently. he collected all his strength, to stir and
utter a sound. he feebly moved his leg and uttered a weak, sickly groan
which aroused his own pity.

“ah! he is alive,” said napoleon. “lift this young man up and carry him
to the dressing station.”

having said this, napoleon rode on to meet marshal lannes, who, hat in
hand, rode up smiling to the emperor to congratulate him on the victory.

prince andrew remembered nothing more: he lost consciousness from the
terrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher, the jolting while
being moved, and the probing of his wound at the dressing station.
he did not regain consciousness till late in the day, when with other
wounded a

bolkónski recognized prince repnín whom he had met in petersburg
society. beside him stood a lad of nineteen, also a wounded officer of
the horse guards.

bonaparte, having come up at a gallop, stopped his horse.

“which is the senior?” he asked, on seeing the prisoners.

they named the colonel, prince repnín.

“you are the commander of the emperor alexander’s regiment of horse
guards?” asked napoleon.

“i commanded a squadron,” replied repnín.

“your regiment fulfilled its duty honorably,” said napoleon.

“the praise of a great commander is a soldier’s highest reward,” said
repnín.

“i bestow it with pleasure,” said napoleon. “and who is that young man
beside you?”

prince repnín named lieutenant sukhtélen.

after looking at him napoleon smiled.

“he’s very young to come to meddle with us.”

“youth is no hindrance to courage,” muttered sukhtélen in a fai

voice.

“a splendid reply!” said napoleon. “young man, you will go far!”

prince andrew, who had also been brought forward before the emperor’s
eyes to complete the show of prisoners, could not fail to attract his
attention. napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on the battlefield
and, addressing him, again used the epithet “young man” that was
connected in his memory with prince andrew.

“well, and you, young man,” said he. “how do you feel, mon brave?”

though five minutes before, prince andrew had been able to say a few
words to the soldiers who were carrying him, now with his eyes fixed
straight on napoleon, he was silent.... so insignificant at that moment
seemed to him all the interests that engrossed

napoleon, so mean did his

everything seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison with the
stern and solemn train of thought that weakness from loss of blood,
suffering, and the nearness of death aroused in him. looking into
napoleon’s eyes prince andrew thought of the insignificance of
greatness, the unimportance of life which no one could understand, and
the still greater unimportance of death, the meaning of which no one
alive could understand or explain.

the emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and said to one of
the officers as he went: “have these gentlemen attended to and taken
to my bivouac; let my doctor, larrey, examine their wounds. au revoir,
prince repnín!” and he spurred his horse and gall

the stretchers moved on. at every jolt he again felt unendurable pain;
his feverishness increased and he grew delirious. visions of his father,
wife, sister, and future son, and the tenderness he had felt the night
before the battle, the figure of the insignificant little napoleon, and
above all this the lofty sky, formed the chief subjects of his delirious
fancies.

the quiet home life and peaceful happiness of bald hills presented
itself to him. he was already enjoying that happiness when that
little napoleon had suddenly appeared with his unsympathizing look of
shortsighted delight at the misery of others, and doubts and torments
had followed, and only the heavens promised peace. toward morning
all these dreams melted and merged into the chaos and darkness of

the inhabitants of the district.

“well, i will read them, then!” bagratión seemed to say, and, fixing
his weary eyes on the paper, began to read them with a fixed and serious
expression. but the author himself took the verses and began reading
them aloud. bagratión bowed his head and listened:

rostóv noticed something new in dólokhov’s relations with sónya, but

was not as much at ease with sónya and dólokhov as before and was less
frequently at home.

in the autumn of 1806 everybody had again begun talking of the war with
napoleon with even greater warmth than the year before. orders were
given to raise recruits, ten men in every thousand for the regular army,
and besides this, nine men in every thousand for the militia. everywhere
bonaparte was anathematized and in moscow nothing but the coming war
was talked of. for the rostóv family the whole interest of these
preparations for war lay in the fact that nicholas would not hear of

this refined selection of society anna pávlovna’s receptions were
also distinguished by the fact that she always presented some new and

toward the end of 1806, when all the sad details of napoleon’s
destruction of the prussian army at jena and auerstädt and the surrender
of most of the prussian fortresses had been received, when our troops

having returned to the regiment and told the commander the state of
denísov’s affairs, rostóv rode to tilsit with the letter to the emperor.

on the thirteenth of june the french and russian emperors arrived in
tilsit. borís drubetskóy had asked the important personage on whom he
was in attendance, to include him in the suite appointed for the stay at
tilsit.

“i should like to see the great man,” he said, alluding to napoleon,
whom hitherto he, like everyone else, had always called buonaparte.

“you are speaking of buonaparte?” asked the general, smiling.

borís looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that he was
being tested.

“i am speaking, prince, of the emperor napoleon,” he replied. the
general patted him on the shoulder, with a smile.

“you will go far,” he said, and took him to tilsit with him.

borís was among the few present at the niemen on the day the two
emperors met. he saw

the raft, decorated with monograms, saw napoleon
pass before the french guards on the farther bank of the river, saw the
pensive face of the emperor alexander as he sat in silence in a tavern
on the bank of the niemen awaiting napoleon’s arrival, saw both emperors
get into boats, and saw how napoleon—reaching the raft first—stepped
quickly forward to meet alexander and held out his hand to him, and how
they both retired into the pavilion. since he had begun to move in the
highest circles borís had made it his habit to watch attentively all
that went on around him and to note it down. at the time of the meeting
at tilsit he asked the names of those who had come with napoleon and
about the uniforms they wore, and listened attentively to words spoken
by important personages. at the moment

would now have been surprised had he been absent.

borís lodged with another adjutant, the polish count zhilínski.
zhilínski, a pole brought up in paris, was rich, and passionately
fond of the french, and almost every day of the stay at tilsit, french
officers of the guard and from french headquarters were dining and
lunching with him and borís.

on the evening of the twenty-fourth of june, count zhilínski arranged a
supper for his french friends. the guest of honor was an aide-de-camp of
napoleon’s, there were also several french officers of the guard, and
a page of napoleon’s, a young lad of an old aristocratic french
family. that same day, rostóv, profiting by the darkness to avoid being
recognized in civilian dress, came to tilsit and went to the lodging
occupied by borís and zhilínski.

rostóv, in common with the whole army from which he came, was far
from having experienced the change of feeling toward napoleon and the
french—who from being foes had suddenly become friend

s—that had taken
place at headquarters and in borís. in the army, bonaparte and the
french were still regarded with mingled feelings of anger, contempt,
and fear. only recently, talking with one of plátov’s cossack officers,
rostóv had argued that if napoleon were taken prisoner he would be
treated not as a sovereign, but as a criminal. quite lately, happening
to meet a wounded french colonel on the road, rostóv had maintained with
heat that peace was impossible between a legitimate sovereign and the
criminal bonaparte. rostóv was therefore unpleasantly struck by the
presence of french officers in borís’ lodging, dressed in uniforms he
had been accustomed to see from quite a different point of view from
the outposts of the flank. as soon as he

rostóv had come to tilsit the day least suitable for a petition on
denísov’s behalf. he could not himself go to the general in attendance
as he was in mufti and had come to tilsit without permission to do
so, and borís, even had he wished to, could not have done so on the
following day. on that day, june 27, the preliminaries of peace were
signed. the emperors exchanged decorations: alexander received the cross
of the legion of honor and napoleon the order of st. andrew of the
first degree, and a dinner had been arranged for the evening, given by
a battalion of the french guards to the preobrazhénsk battalion. the
emperors were to be present at that banquet.

rostóv felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with borís that, when the
latter looked in after supper, he pretended to be asleep, and early next
morning went away, avoiding borís. in his civilian clothes and a
round hat, he wandered about the town, staring at the french and thei

rode down the street at a gallop. beside himself with enthusiasm, rostóv
ran after him with the crowd.





chapter xxi

the emperor rode to the square where, facing one another, a battalion
of the preobrazhénsk regiment stood on the right and a battalion of the
french guards in their bearskin caps on the left.

as the tsar rode up to one flank of the battalions, which presented
arms, another group of horsemen galloped up to the opposite flank, and
at the head of them rostóv recognized napoleon. it could be no one else.
he came at a gallop, wearing a small hat, a blue uniform open over a
white vest, and the st. andrew ribbon over his shoulder. he was riding
a very fine thoroughbred gray arab horse with a crimson gold-embroidered
saddlecloth. on approaching alexander he raised his hat, and as he did
so, rostóv, with his cavalryman’s eye, could not help noticing that
napoleon did not sit well or firmly in the saddle. the battalions
shouted “hurrah!” and “vive l’empereur!” n

apoleon said something to
alexander, and both emperors dismounted and took each other’s hands.
napoleon’s face wore an unpleasant and artificial smile. alexander was
saying something affable to him.

in spite of the trampling of the french gendarmes’ horses, which were
pushing back the crowd, rostóv kept his eyes on every movement of
alexander and bonaparte. it struck him as a surprise that alexander
treated bonaparte as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease with
the tsar, as if such relations with an emperor were an everyday matter
to him.

alexander and napoleon, with the long tra

in of their suites, approached
the right flank of the preobrazhénsk battalion and came straight up to
the crowd standing there. the crowd unexpectedly found itself so close
to the emperors that rostóv, standing in the front row, was afraid he
might be recognized.

“sire, i ask your permission to present the legion of honor to the
bravest of your soldiers,” said a sharp, precise voice, articulating
every letter.

this was said by the undersized napoleon, looking up straight into
alexander’s eyes. alexander listened attentively to what was said to him
and, bending his head, smiled pleasantly.

“to him who has borne himself most bravely in this last war,” added
napoleon, accentuating each syllable, as with a composure and assurance
exasperating to rostóv, he ran his eyes over the russian ranks drawn
up before him, who all presented arms with their eyes fixed on their
emperor.

“will your majesty allow me to consult the colonel?” said 
 
 ___________________________
 
ive him an answer.”

kozlóvski scanned the ranks resolutely and included rostóv in his
scrutiny.

“can it be me?” thought rostóv.

“lázarev!” the colonel called, with a frown, and lázarev, the first
soldier in the rank, stepped briskly forward.

“where are you off to? stop here!” voices whispered to lázarev who did
not know where to go. lázarev stopped, casting a sidelong look at his
colonel in alarm. his face twitched, as often happens to soldiers called
before the ranks.

napoleon slightly turned his head, and put his plump little hand out
behind him as if to take something. the members of his suite, guessing
at once what he wanted, moved about and whispered as they passed
something from one to another, and a page—the same one rostóv had seen
the previous evening at borís’—ran forward and, bowing respectfully over
the outstretched hand and not keeping it waiting a moment, laid in it
an order on a red ribbon. napoleon, without looking, pressed two fingers
together

 and the badge was between them. then he approached lázarev (who
rolled his eyes and persistently gazed at his own monarch), looked round
at the emperor alexander to imply that what he was now doing was done
for the sake of his ally, and the small white hand holding the order
touched one of lázarev’s buttons. it was as if napoleon knew that it was
only necessary for his hand to deign to touch that soldier’s breast
for the soldier to be forever happy, rewarded, and distinguished from
everyone else in the world. napoleon merely laid the cross on lázarev’s
breast and, dropping his hand, turned toward alexander as though sure
that the cross would adhere there. and it really did.

officious hands, russian and french, immediately seized the cross and
fastened it to the uniform. lázarev glanced morosely at the little man

“yes, but what luck for lázarev! twelve hundred francs’ pension for
life.”

“here’s a cap, lads!” shouted a preobrazhénsk soldier, donning a shaggy
french cap.

“it’s a fine thing! first-rate!”

“have you heard the password?” asked one guards’ officer of another.
“the day before yesterday it was ‘napoléon, france, bravoure’;
yesterday, ‘alexandre, russie, grandeur.’ one day our emperor gives it
and next day napoleon. tomorrow our emperor will send a st. george’s
cross to the bravest of the french guards. it has to be done. he must
respond in kind.”

borís, too, with his friend zhilínski, came to see the preobrazhénsk
banquet. on his way back, he noticed rostóv standing by the corner of a
house.

“rostóv! how d’you do? we missed one another,” he said, and could
not refrain from asking what was the matter, so strangely dismal and
troubled was rostóv’s face.

“nothing, nothing,” replied

to get something to
eat before going away. he went to a hotel he had noticed that morning.
there he found so many people, among them officers who, like himself,
had come in civilian clothes, that he had difficulty in getting a
dinner. two officers of his own division joined him. the conversation
naturally turned on the peace. the officers, his comrades, like most of
the army, were dissatisfied with the peace concluded after the battle of
friedland. they said that had we held out a little longer napoleon would
have been done for, as his troops had neither provisions nor ammunition.
nicholas ate and drank (chiefly the latter) in silence. he finished a
couple of bottles of wine by himself. the process in his mind went on
tormenting him without reaching a conclusion. he feared to give way to
his thoughts, yet could not get rid of them. suddenly, on one of the
officers’ saying that it was humiliating to look at the french, rostóv
began shouting with uncalled-for wrath, and therefore much to the

banging the table—very little to the point as it seemed to his
listeners, but quite relevantly to the course of his own thoughts.

“our business is to do our duty, to fight and not to think! that’s
all....” said he.

“and to drink,” said one of the officers, not wishing to quarrel.

“yes, and to drink,” assented nicholas. “hullo there! another bottle!”
he shouted.

in 1808 the emperor alexander went to erfurt for a fresh interview with
the emperor napoleon, and in the upper circles of petersburg there was
much talk of the grandeur of this important meeting.





chapter xxii

in 1809 the intimacy between “the world’s two arbiters,” as napoleon
and alexander were called, was such that when napoleon declared war on
austria a russian corps crossed the frontier to co-operate with our
old enemy bonaparte against our old ally the emperor of austria, and in
court circles the possibility of marriage between napoleon and one of

directed on the internal changes that were being undertaken in all the
departments of government.

life meanwhile—real life, with its essential interests of health and
sickness, toil and rest, and its intellectual interests in thought,
science, poetry, music, love, friendship, hatred, and passions—went on
as usual, independently of and apart from political friendship or enmity
with napoleon bonaparte and from all the schemes of reconstruction.

prince andrew had spent two years continuously in the country.

all the plans pierre had attempted on his estates—and constantly
changing from one thing to another had never accomplished—were carried
out by prince andrew without display and without perceptible difficulty.

d, rather humid eyes, or so firm a smile that expressed
nothing; nor had he heard such a refined, smooth, soft voice; above all
he had never seen such delicate whiteness of face or hands—hands which
were broad, but very plump, soft, and white. such whiteness and softness
prince andrew had only seen on the faces of soldiers who had been long
in hospital. this was speránski, secretary of state, reporter to the
emperor and his companion at erfurt, where he had more than once met and
talked with napoleon.

speránski did not shift his eyes from one face to another as people
involuntarily do on entering a large company and was in no hurry to
speak. he spoke slowly, with assurance that he would be listened to, and
he looked only at the person with whom he was conversing.

prince andrew followed speránski’s every word and movement with
particular attention. as happens to some people, especially to men
who judge those near to them severely, he always on meeting

speránski went on to say that honor, l’honneur, cannot be upheld by
privileges harmful to the service; that honor, l’honneur, is either a
negative concept of not doing what is blameworthy or it is a source of
emulation in pursuit of commendation and rewards, which recognize it.
his arguments were concise, simple, and clear.

“an institution upholding honor, the source of emulation, is one similar
to the légion d’honneur of the great emperor napoleon, not harmful
but helpful to the success of the service, but not a class or court
privilege.”

“i do not dispute that, but it cannot be denied that court privileges
have attained the same end,” returned prince andrew. “every courtier
considers himself bound to maintain his position worthily.”

“yet you do not care to avail yourself of the privilege, prince,” said
speránski, indicating by a smile that he wished to finish amiably an
argument which was embarrassing for his companion.

chapter ix

at that time, as always happens, the highest society that met at court
and at the grand balls was divided into several circles, each with its
own particular tone. the largest of these was the french circle of the
napoleonic alliance, the circle of count rumyántsev and caulaincourt.
in this group hélène, as soon as she had settled in petersburg with her
husband, took a very prominent place. she was visited by the members of
the french embassy and by many belonging to that circle and noted for
their intellect and polished manners.

hélène had been at erfurt during the famous meeting of the emperors
and had brought from there these connections with the napoleonic
notabilities. at erfurt her success had been br

gaining the reputation “d’ une femme charmante, aussi spirituelle que

after dinner speránski’s daughter and her governess rose. he patted the
little girl with his white hand and kissed her. and that gesture, too,
seemed unnatural to prince andrew.

the men remained at table over their port—english fashion. in the midst
of a conversation that was started about napoleon’s spanish affairs,
which they all agreed in approving, prince andrew began to express a
contrary opinion. speránski smiled and, with an evident wish to prevent
the conversation from taking an unpleasant course, told a story that had
no connection with the previous conversation. for a few moments all were
silent.

having sat some time at table, speránski corked a bottle of wine and,
remarking, “nowadays good wine rides in a carriage and pair,” passed it

time longed with all his heart to establish a republic in russia;
then himself to be a napoleon; then to be a philosopher; and then
a strategist and the conqueror of napoleon? had he not seen the

there were no answers to these questions he made haste to turn away
from them, and took up a book, or hurried off to the club or to apollón
nikoláevich’s, to exchange the gossip of the town.

“hélène, who has never cared for anything but her own body and is one
of the stupidest women in the world,” thought pierre, “is regarded by
people as the acme of intelligence and refinement, and they pay homage
to her. napoleon bonaparte was despised by all as long as he was great,
but now that he has become a wretched comedian the emperor francis wants
to offer him his daughter in an illegal marriage. the spaniards, through

g that he took heed of
what was being reported to him. the tone of the conversation was such as
indicated that no one approved of what was being done in the political
world. incidents were related evidently confirming the opinion that
everything was going from bad to worse, but whether telling a story or
giving an opinion the speaker always stopped, or was stopped, at the
point beyond which his criticism might touch the sovereign himself.

at dinner the talk turned on the latest political news: napoleon’s
seizure of the duke of oldenburg’s territory, and the russian note,
hostile to napoleon, which had been sent to all the european courts.

“bonaparte treats europe as a pirate does a captured vessel,” said count
rostopchín, repeating a phrase he had uttered several times before. “one
only wonders at the long-suffering or blindness of the crowned heads.
now the pope’s turn has come and bonaparte doesn’t scruple to depose the
head of the catholic church—yet all keep silent! our

smiled.

to pierre that smile said plainly: “i am well, but my health is now of
no use to anyone.”

after a few words to pierre about the awful roads from the polish
frontier, about people he had met in switzerland who knew pierre, and
about m. dessalles, whom he had brought from abroad to be his son’s
tutor, prince andrew again joined warmly in the conversation about
speránski which was still going on between the two old men.

“if there were treason, or proofs of secret relations with napoleon,
they would have been made public,” he said with warmth and haste. “i do
not, and never did, like speránski personally, but i like justice!”

pierre now recognized in his friend a need with which he was only too
familiar, to get excited and to have arguments about extraneous matters
in order to stifle thoughts that were too oppressive and too intimate.
when prince meshchérski had left, prince andrew took pierre’s arm and
asked him into the room that had been assigned him. a bed had be

cheries, thefts, forgeries, issues of false money,
burglaries, incendiarisms, and murders as in whole centuries are not
recorded in the annals of all the law courts of the world, but which
those who committed them did not at the time regard as being crimes.

what produced this extraordinary occurrence? what were its causes? the
historians tell us with naïve assurance that its causes were the wrongs
inflicted on the duke of oldenburg, the nonobservance of the continental
system, the ambition of napoleon, the firmness of alexander, the
mistakes of the diplomatists, and so on.

consequently, it would only have been necessary for metternich,
rumyántsev, or talleyrand, between a levee and an evening party, to have
taken proper pains and written a more adroit note, or for napoleon to
have written to alexander: “my respected brother, i consent to restore
the duchy to the duke of oldenburg”—and there would have been no war.

we can understand that the matter seemed like that to contemporaries.

it naturally seemed to napoleon that the war was caused by england’s
intrigues (as in fact he said on the island of st. helena). it naturally
seemed to members of the english parliament that the cause of the war
was napoleon’s ambition; to the duke of oldenburg, that the cause of the
war was the violence done to him; to businessmen that the cause of the
war was the continental system which was ruining europe; to the generals
and old soldiers that the chief reason for the war was the necessity of
giving them employment; to the legitimists of that day that it was the
need of re-establishing les bons principes, and to the diplomatists of
that time that it all resulted from the fact that the alliance between

of view, presented themselves to the men of that day; but to us, to

themselves. the deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of
them we find; and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears
to us equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance
compared to the magnitude of the events, and by its impotence—apart
from the cooperation of all the other coincident causes—to occasion the
event. to us, the wish or objection of this or that french corporal to
serve a second term appears as much a cause as napoleon’s refusal to
withdraw his troops beyond the vistula and to restore the duchy of
oldenburg; for had he not wished to serve, and had a second, a third,
and a thousandth corporal and private also refused, there would have
been so many less men in napoleon’s army and the war could not have
occurred.

beyond the vistula, and not ordered his troops to advance, there would
have been no war; but had all his sergeants objected to s

revolution, and so on. without each of these causes nothing could have
happened. so all these causes—myriads of causes—coincided to bring it
about. and so there was no one cause for that occurrence, but it had
to occur because it had to. millions of men, renouncing their human
feelings and reason, had to go from west to east to slay their fellows,
just as some centuries previously hordes of men had come from the east
to the west, slaying their fellows.

the actions of napoleon and alexander, on whose words the event seemed
to hang, were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who was
drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription. this could not be
otherwise, for in order that the will of napoleon and alexander (on whom
the event seemed to depend) should be carried out, the concurrence of
innumerable circumstances was needed without anyone of which the event
could not have taken place. it was necessary that millions of men in

by the law of coincidence thousands of minute causes fitted in and
co-ordinated to produce that movement and war: reproaches for the
nonobservance of the continental system, the duke of oldenburg’s
wrongs, the movement of troops into prussia—undertaken (as it seemed to
napoleon) only for the purpose of securing an armed peace, the
french emperor’s love and habit of war coinciding with his people’s
inclinations, allurement by the grandeur of the preparations, and the
expenditure on those preparations and the need of obtaining advantages
to compensate for that expenditure, the intoxicating honors he received

on the twenty-ninth of may napoleon left dresden, where he had spent
three weeks surrounded by a court that included princes, dukes, kings,
and even an emperor. before leaving, napoleon showed favor to the
emperor, kings, and princes who had deserved it, reprimanded the kings
and princes with whom he was dissatisfied, presented pearls and diamonds
of his own—that is, which he had taken from other kings—to the empress
of austria, and having, as his historian tells us, tenderly embraced the
empress marie louise—who regarded him as her husband, though he had left
another wife in paris—left her grieved by the parting which she seemed
hardly able to bear. though the diploma

the possibility of peace and worked zealously to that end, and though
the emperor napoleon himself wrote a letter to alexander, calling him
monsieur mon frère, and sincerely assured him that he did not want war
and would always love and honor him—yet he set off to join his army,
and at every station gave fresh orders to accelerate the movement of his
troops from west to east. he went in a traveling coach with six horses,
surrounded by pages, aides-de-camp, and an escort, along the road to

next day, overtaking the army, he went in a carriage to the niemen, and,
changing into a polish uniform, he drove to the riverbank in order to
select a place for the crossing.

seeing, on the other side, some cossacks (les cosaques) and the
wide-spreading steppes in the midst of which lay the holy city of moscow
(moscou, la ville sainte), the capital of a realm such as the scythia
into which alexander the great had marched—napoleon unexpectedly, and
contrary alike to strategic and diplomatic considerations, ordered an
advance, and the next day his army began to cross the niemen.

early in the morning of the twelfth of june he came out of his tent,
which was pitched that day on the steep left bank of the niemen, and

the river. the troops, knowing of the emperor’s presence, were on

characters and social positions. on the faces of all was one common
expression of joy at the commencement of the long-expected campaign and
of rapture and devotion to the man in the gray coat who was standing on
the hill.

on the thirteenth of june a rather small, thoroughbred arab horse was
brought to napoleon. he mounted it and rode at a gallop to one of the
bridges over the niemen, deafened continually by incessant and rapturous
acclamations which he evidently endured only because it was impossible
to forbid the soldiers to express their love of him by such shouting,
but the shouting which accompanied him everywhere disturbed him and
distracted him from the military cares that had occupied him from the
time he joined the army. he rode across one of the swaying pontoon
bridges to the farther side, t

urned sharply to the left, and galloped in
the direction of kóvno, preceded by enraptured, mounted chasseurs of the
guard who, breathless with delight, galloped ahead to clear a path for
him through the troops. on reaching the broad river víliya, he stopped
near a regiment of polish uhlans stationed by the river.

“vivat!” shouted the poles, ecstatically, breaking their ranks and
pressing against one another to see him.

napoleon looked up and down the river, dismounted, and sat down on a log
that lay on the bank. at a mute sign from him, a telescope was handed
him which he rested on the back of a happy page who had run up to him,
and he gazed at the opposite bank. then he became absorbed in a map laid
out on the logs. without lifting his head he said something, and two of
his aides-de-camp galloped off to the polish uhlans.

“what? what did he say?” was heard in the ranks of the polish uhlans
when one of the aides-

some forty uhlans were drowned in the river, though boats were sent to
their assistance. the majority struggled back to the bank from which
they had started. the colonel and some of his men got across and with
difficulty clambered out on the further bank. and as soon as they had
got out, in their soaked and streaming clothes, they shouted “vivat!”
and looked ecstatically at the spot where napoleon had been but where he
no longer was and at that moment considered themselves happy.

that evening, between issuing one order that the forged russian paper
money prepared for use in russia should be delivered as quickly as
possible and another that a saxon should be shot, on whom a letter
containing information about the orders to the french army had been
found, napoleon also gave instructions that the polish colonel who
had needlessly plunged into the river should be enrolled in the légion

the emperor of russia had, meanwhile, been in vílna for more than a
month, reviewing troops and holding maneuvers. nothing was ready for the
war that everyone expected and to prepare for which the emperor had come
from petersburg. there was no general plan of action. the vacillation
between the various plans that were proposed had even increased after

the emperor gave his consent. the aides-de-camp collected money by
subscription. the lady who was thought to be most pleasing to the
emperor was invited to act as hostess. count bennigsen, being a
landowner in the vílna province, offered his country house for the fete,
and the thirteenth of june was fixed for a ball, dinner, regatta, and
fireworks at zakret, count bennigsen’s country seat.

the very day that napoleon issued the order to cross the niemen, and
his vanguard, driving off the cossacks, crossed the russian frontier,
alexander spent the evening at the entertainment given by his
aides-de-camp at bennigsen’s country house.

it was a gay and brilliant fete. connoisseurs of such matters declared
that rarely had so many beautiful women been assembled in one place.

and resentment the emperor had found a phrase that pleased him, fully
expressed his feelings, and has since become famous. on returning home
at two o’clock that night he sent for his secretary, shishkóv, and told
him to write an order to the troops and a rescript to field marshal
prince saltykóv, in which he insisted on the words being inserted that
he would not make peace so long as a single armed frenchman remained on
russian soil.

next day the following letter was sent to napoleon:

monsieur mon frère,

yesterday i learned that, despite the loyalty with which i have kept
my engagements with your majesty, your troops have crossed the russian
frontier, and i have this moment received from petersburg a note, in
which count lauriston informs me, as a reason for this aggression, that

(signed) alexander.





chapter iv

at two in the morning of the fourteenth of june, the emperor, having
sent for balashëv and read him his letter to napoleon, ordered him to
take it and hand it personally to the french emperor. when dispatching
balashëv, the emperor repeated to him the words that he would not make
peace so long as a single armed enemy remained on russian soil and told
him to transmit those words to napoleon. alexander did not insert them
in his letter to napoleon, because with his characteristic tact he felt
it would be injudicious to use them at a moment when a last attempt at
reconciliation was being made, but he definitely instr

having set off in the small hours of the fourteenth, accompanied by a
bugler and two cossacks, balashëv reached the french outposts at the
village of rykónty, on the russian side of the niemen, by dawn. there he
was stopped by french cavalry sentinels.

a french noncommissioned officer of hussars, in crimson uniform and a
shaggy cap, shouted to the approaching balashëv to halt. balashëv did
not do so at once, but continued to advance along the road at a walking
pace.

city, while walking through the streets with his wife, some italians
called out to him: “viva il re!” * he turned to his wife with a pensive
smile and said: “poor fellows, they don’t know that i am leaving them
tomorrow!”

* “long live the king.”


but though he firmly believed himself to be king of naples and pitied
the grief felt by the subjects he was abandoning, latterly, after he had
been ordered to return to military service—and especially since his last
interview with napoleon in danzig, when his august brother-in-law had
told him: “i made you king that you should reign in my way, but not in
yours!”—he had cheerfully taken up his familiar business, and—like a
well-fed but not overfat horse that feels himself in harness and grows
skittish between the shafts—he dressed up in clothes as variegated and
expensive as possible, and gaily and contentedly galloped along the
roads of poland, without himself knowing why or whither.

murat’s face beamed with stupid satisfaction as he listened to “monsieur
de bal-macheve.” but royauté oblige! * and he felt it incumbent on
him, as a king and an ally, to confer on state affairs with alexander’s
envoy. he dismounted, took balashëv’s arm, and moving a few steps away
from his suite, which waited respectfully, began to pace up and down
with him, trying to speak significantly. he referred to the fact that
the emperor napoleon had resented the demand that he should withdraw his
troops from prussia, especially when that demand became generally known
and the dignity of france was thereby offended.

* “royalty has its obligations.”


balashëv replied that there was “nothing offensive in the demand,
because...” but murat interrupted him.

“then you don’t consider the emperor alexander the aggressor?” he asked
unexpectedly, with a kindly and foolish smile.

balashëv told him why he considered napoleon to b

naples. then suddenly, as if remembering his royal dignity,
murat solemnly drew himself up, assumed the pose in which he had stood
at his coronation, and, waving his right arm, said:

“i won’t detain you longer, general. i wish success to your mission,”
and with his embroidered red mantle, his flowing feathers, and his
glittering ornaments, he rejoined his suite who were respectfully
awaiting him.

balashëv rode on, supposing from murat’s words that he would very soon
be brought before napoleon himself. but instead of that, at the next
village the sentinels of davout’s infantry corps detained him as
the pickets of the vanguard had done, and an adjutant of the corps
commander, who was fetched, conducted him into the village to marshal
davout.





chapter v

davout was to napoleon what arakchéev was to alexander—though not a
coward like arakchéev, he was as precise, as cruel, and as unable to
express his devotion to his monarch except by cruelty.

balashëv’s face, which was animated by the beauty of the morning and
by his talk with murat, he did not rise or even stir, but scowled still
more and sneered malevolently.

when he noticed in balashëv’s face the disagreeable impression this
reception produced, davout raised his head and coldly asked what he
wanted.

thinking he could have been received in such a manner only because
davout did not know that he was adjutant general to the emperor
alexander and even his envoy to napoleon, balashëv hastened to inform
him of his rank and mission. contrary to his expectation, davout, after
hearing him, became still surlier and ruder.

“where is your dispatch?” he inquired. “give it to me. i will send it to
the emperor.”

balashëv replied that he had been ordered to hand it personally to the
emperor.

“your emperor’s orders are obeyed in your army, but here,” said davout,
“you must do as you’re told.”

and, as if to make the russian general still more consciou

onsciousness of his impotence
and insignificance—particularly acute by contrast with the sphere of
power in which he had so lately moved—and after several marches with
the marshal’s baggage and the french army, which occupied the
whole district, balashëv was brought to vílna—now occupied by the
french—through the very gate by which he had left it four days
previously.

next day the imperial gentleman-in-waiting, the comte de turenne, came
to balashëv and informed him of the emperor napoleon’s wish to honor him
with an audience.

four days before, sentinels of the preobrazhénsk regiment had stood in
front of the house to which balashëv was conducted, and now two french
grenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front and with
shaggy caps on their heads, and an escort of hussars and uhlans and a
brilliant suite of aides-de-camp, pages, and generals, who were waiting
for napoleon to come out, were standing at the porch, round his saddle
horse and his mameluke, rustan.

napoleon received balashëv in the very
house in vílna from which alexander had dispatched him on his mission.





chapter vi

though balashëv was used to imperial pomp, he was amazed at the luxury
and magnificence of napoleon’s court.

the comte de turenne showed him into a big reception room where many
generals, gentlemen-in-waiting, and polish magnates—several of whom
balashëv had seen at the court of the emperor of russia—were waiting.
duroc said that napoleon would receive the russian general before going
for his ride.

after some minutes, the gentleman-in-waiting who was on duty came into
the great reception room and, bowing politely, asked balashëv to follow
him.

balashëv went into a small reception room, one door of which led into a
study, the very one from which the russian emperor had dispatched him
on his mission. he stood a minute or two, waiting. he heard hurried
footsteps beyond the door, both halves of it were opened rapidly; all

lent and then from the study the sound was heard of other steps,
firm and resolute—they were those of napoleon. he had just finished
dressing for his ride, and wore a blue uniform, opening in front over
a white waistcoat so long that it covered his rotund stomach, white
leather breeches tightly fitting the fat thighs of his short legs, and
hessian boots. his short hair had evidently just been brushed, but one
lock hung down in the middle of his broad forehead. his plump white neck
stood out sharply above the black collar of his uniform, and he smelled
of eau de cologne. his full face, rather young-looki

ely on his will.

“i do not, and did not, desire war,” he continued, “but it has been
forced on me. even now” (he emphasized the word) “i am ready to receive
any explanations you can give me.”

and he began clearly and concisely to explain his reasons for
dissatisfaction with the russian government. judging by the calmly
moderate and amicable tone in which the french emperor spoke, balashëv
was firmly persuaded that he wished for peace and intended to enter into
negotiations.

when napoleon, having finished speaking, looked inquiringly at the
russian envoy, balashëv began a speech he had prepared long before:
“sire! the emperor, my master...” but the sight of the emperor’s eyes
bent on him confused him. “you are flurried—compose yourself!” napoleon
seemed to say, as with a scarcely perceptible smile he looked at
balashëv’s uniform and sword.

balashëv recovered himself and began to speak. he said that the
emperor alexander did not consider kurákin’s demand for

his passports a
sufficient cause for war; that kurákin had acted on his own initiative
and without his sovereign’s assent, that the emperor alexander did not
desire war, and had no relations with england.

“not yet!” interposed napoleon, and, as if fearing to give vent to his
feelings, he frowned and nodded slightly as a sign that balashëv might
proceed.

after saying all he had been instructed to say, balashëv added that
the emperor alexander wished for peace, but would not enter into
negotiations except on condition that... here balashëv hesitated:
he remembered the words the emperor alexander had not written in his
letter, but had specially inserted in the rescript to saltykóv and had
told balashëv to repeat to napoleo
 
 ___________________________
 
n. balashëv remembered these words,
“so long as a single armed foe remains on russian soil,” but some
complex feeling restrained him. he could not utter them, though he
wished to do so. he grew confused and said: “on condition that the
french army retires beyond the niemen.”

napoleon noticed balashëv’s embarrassment when uttering these last
words; his face twitched and the calf of his left leg began to quiver
rhythmically. without moving from where he stood he began speaking in
a louder tone and more hurriedly than before. during the speech that
followed, balashëv, who more than once lowered his eyes, involuntarily
noticed the quivering of napoleon’s left leg which increased the more
napoleon raised his voice.

“i desire peace, no less than the emperor alexander,”
 
 ___________________________
 
 he began. “have
i not for eighteen months been doing everything to obtain it? i
have waited eighteen months for explanations. but in order to begin
negotiations, what is demanded of me?” he said, frowning and making an
energetic gesture of inquiry with his small white plump hand.

“the withdrawal of your army beyond the niemen, sire,” replied balashëv.

“the niemen?” repeated napoleon. “so now you want me to retire beyond
the niemen—only the niemen?” repeated napoleon, looking straight at
balashëv.

the latter bowed his head respectfully.

instead of the demand of four months earlier to withdraw from pomerania,
only a withdrawal beyond the niemen was now demanded. napoleon turned
quickly and began to pace the room.

“you say the demand now is that i am to withdraw beyond the niemen
before commencing negotiations, but in just the same way two months ago
the demand was that i should withdraw beyond the vistula and the oder,
and yet you are willing to negoti

ate.”

he went in silence from one corner of the room to the other and again
stopped in front of balashëv. balashëv noticed that his left leg was
quivering faster than before and his face seemed petrified in its stern
expression. this quivering of his left leg was a thing napoleon was
conscious of. “the vibration of my left calf is a great sign with me,”
he remarked at a later date.

“such demands as to retreat beyond the vistula and oder may be made to a
prince of baden, but not to me!” napoleon almost screamed, quite to his
own surprise. “if you gave me petersburg and moscow i could not accept
such conditions. you say i have begun this war! but who first joined his
army? the emperor alexander, not i! and you offer me negotiations when i
have expended millions

tention of demonstrating the advantages of his position and showing
that he was nevertheless willing to negotiate. but he had begun talking,
and the more he talked the less could he control his words.

the whole purport of his remarks now was evidently to exalt himself and
insult alexander—just what he had least desired at the commencement of
the interview.

“i hear you have made peace with turkey?”

balashëv bowed his head affirmatively.

“peace has been concluded...” he began.

but napoleon did not let him speak. he evidently wanted to do all the
talking himself, and continued to talk with the sort of eloquence and
unrestrained irritability to which spoiled people are so prone.

“yes, i know you have made peace with the turks without obtaining
moldavia and wallachia; i would have given your sovereign those
provinces as i gave him finland. yes,” he went on, “i promised and would
have given the emperor alexander moldavia and wallachia, and now he

paced up and down the room, repeating to balashëv almost the very words
he had used to alexander himself at tilsit. “all that, he would have
owed to my friendship. oh, what a splendid reign!” he repeated several
times, then paused, drew from his pocket a gold snuffbox, lifted it to
his nose, and greedily sniffed at it.

“what a splendid reign the emperor alexander’s might have been!”

he looked compassionately at balashëv, and as soon as the latt

to make some rejoinder hastily interrupted him.

“what could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained
through my friendship?” demanded napoleon, shrugging his shoulders
in perplexity. “but no, he has preferred to surround himself with
my enemies, and with whom? with steins, armfeldts, bennigsens, and
wintzingerodes! stein, a traitor expelled from his own country;
armfeldt, a rake and an intriguer; wintzingerode, a fugitive french
subject; bennigsen, rather more of a soldier than the others, but all
the same an incompetent who was unable to do anything in 1807 and who
should awaken terrible memories in the emperor alexander’s mind..

granted that were they competent they might be made use of,” continued
napoleon—hardly able to keep pace in words with the rush of thoughts
that incessantly sprang up, proving how right and strong he was (in his
perception the two were one and the same)—“but they are not even that!
they are neither fit for war nor peace! barclay is said to be the
most capable of them all, but i cannot say so, judging by his first
movements. and what are they doing, all these courtiers? pfuel proposes,

a quick eye, and resolution.... and what role is your young monarch
playing in that monstrous crowd? they compromise him and throw on him
the responsibility for all that happens. a sovereign should not be with
the army unless he is a general!” said napoleon, evidently uttering
these words as a direct challenge to the emperor. he knew how alexander
desired to be a military commander.

“the campaign began only a week ago, and you haven’t even been able to
defend vílna. you are cut in two and have been driven out of the polish
provinces. your army is grumbling.”

“on the contrary, your majesty,” said balashëv, hardly able to remember
what had been said to him and following these verbal fireworks with
difficulty, “the troops are burning

“i know everything!” napoleon interrupted him. “i know everything. i
know the number of your battalions as exactly as i know my own. you have
not two hundred thousand men, and i have three times that number. i give
you my word of honor,” said napoleon, forgetting that his word of honor
could carry no weight—“i give you my word of honor that i have five
hundred and thirty thousand men this side of the vistula. the turks will
be of no use to you; they are worth nothing and have shown it by making
peace with you. as for the swedes—it is their fate to be governed by
mad kings. their king was insane and they changed him for
another—bernadotte, who promptly went mad—for no swede would ally
himself with russia unless he were mad.”

leon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox to his nose.

balashëv knew how to reply to each of napoleon’s remarks, and would
have done so; he continually made the gesture of a man wishing to say
something, but napoleon always interrupted him. to the alleged insanity
of the swedes, balashëv wished to reply that when russia is on her side
sweden is practically an island: but napoleon gave an angry exclamation
to drown his voice. napoleon was in that state of irritability in which
a man has to talk, talk, and talk, merely to convince himself that he is
in the right. balashëv began to feel uncomfortable: as envoy he feared
to demean his dignity and felt the necessity of replying; but, as a man,
he shrank before the transport of groundless wrath that had evidently
seized napoleon. he knew that none of the words now uttered by napoleon
had any significance, and that napoleon himself would be ashamed of them
when he came to his sen

ses. balashëv stood with downcast eyes, looking
at the movements of napoleon’s stout legs and trying to avoid meeting
his eyes.

“but what do i care about your allies?” said napoleon. “i have
allies—the poles. there are eighty thousand of them and they fight like
lions. and there will be two hundred thousand of them.”

and probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered this
obvious falsehood, and that balashëv still stood silently before him in
the same attitude of submission to fate, napoleon abruptly turned
round, drew close to balashëv’s face, and, gesticulating rapidly and
energetically with his white hands, almost shouted:

he put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pocket, took it out again, lifted
it several times to his nose, and stopped in front of balashëv. he
paused, looked ironically straight into balashëv’s eyes, and said in a
quiet voice:

“and yet what a splendid reign your master might have had!”

balashëv, feeling it incumbent on him to reply, said that from the
russian side things did not appear in so gloomy a light. napoleon was
silent, still looking derisively at him and evidently not listening to
him. balashëv said that in russia the best results were expected from
the war. napoleon nodded condescendingly, as if to say, “i know it’s
your duty to say that, but you don’t believe it yourself. i have
convinced you.”

when balashëv had ended, napoleon again took out his snuffbox, sniffed
at it, and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal. the door
opened, a gentleman-in-waiting, bending respectfully,

his hat and gloves; another brought him a pocket handkerchief. napoleon,
without giving them a glance, turned to balashëv:

“assure the emperor alexander from me,” said he, taking his hat, “that
i am as devoted to him as before: i know him thoroughly and very highly
esteem his lofty qualities. i will detain you no longer, general; you
shall receive my letter to the emperor.”

and napoleon went quickly to the door. everyone in the reception room
rushed forward and descended the staircase.





chapter vii

after all that napoleon had said to him—those bursts of anger and the
last dryly spoken words: “i will detain you no longer, general; you
shall receive my letter,” balashëv felt convinced that napoleon would
not wish to see him, and would even avoid another meeting with him—an
insulted envoy—especially as he had witnessed his unseemly anger. but,
to his surprise, bal
 
 ___________________________
 
ashëv received, through duroc, an invitation to dine
with the emperor that day.

bessières, caulaincourt, and berthier were present at that dinner.

napoleon met balashëv cheerfully and amiably. he not only showed no sign
of constraint or self-reproach on account of his outburst that morning,
but, on the contrary, tried to reassure balashëv. it was evident that
he had long been convinced that it was impossible for him to make a
mistake, and that in his perception whatever he did was right, not
because it harmonized with any idea of right and wrong, but because he
did it.

the emperor was in very good spirits after his ride through vílna, where
cr
 
 ___________________________
 
owds of people had rapturously greeted and followed him. from all
the windows of the streets through which he rode, rugs, flags, and his
monogram were displayed, and the polish ladies, welcoming him, waved
their handkerchiefs to him.

at dinner, having placed balashëv beside him, napoleon not only treated
him amiably but behaved as if balashëv were one of his own courtiers,
one of those who sympathized with his plans and ought to rejoice at
his success. in the course of conversation he mentioned moscow and
questioned balashëv about the russian capital, not merely as an
interested traveler asks about a new city he intends to visit, but as
if convinced that balashëv, as a russian, must be flattered by his
curiosity.

“how many inhabitants are there in moscow? how many houses?
 
 ___________________________
 
 is it true
that moscow is called ‘holy moscow’? how many churches are there in
moscow?” he asked.

and receiving the reply that there were more than two hundred churches,
he remarked:

“why such a quantity of churches?”

“the russians are very devout,” replied balashëv.

“but a large number of monasteries and churches is always a sign of the
backwardness of a people,” said napoleon, turning to caulaincourt for
appreciation of this remark.

balashëv respectfully ventured to disagree with the french emperor.

“every country has its own character,” said he.

“but nowhere in europe is there anything like that,” said napoleon.

“i beg your majesty’s pardon,” returned balashëv, “besides russia there
is spain, where there are also many churches and monasteries.”

this reply of balashëv’s, which hinted at the recent defeats of the
french in spain, was much 
 
 ___________________________
 
appreciated when he related it at alexander’s
court, but it was not much appreciated at napoleon’s dinner, where it
passed unnoticed.

the uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that they
were puzzled as to what balashëv’s tone suggested. “if there is a point
we don’t see it, or it is not at all witty,” their expressions seemed
to say. so little was his rejoinder appreciated that napoleon did not
notice it at all and naïvely asked balashëv through what towns the
direct road from there to moscow passed. balashëv, who was on the alert
all through the dinner, replied that just as “all roads lead to rome,”
so all roads lead to moscow: there were many roads, and “among them the
road through poltáva, which charles xii chose.” balashëv involuntarily
flushed with pleasure at the aptitude of this reply, but hardly had
he uttered the word poltáva before caulaincourt began sp

eaking of the
badness of the road from petersburg to moscow and of his petersburg
reminiscences.

after dinner they went to drink coffee in napoleon’s study, which four
days previously had been that of the emperor alexander. napoleon sat
down, toying with his sèvres coffee cup, and motioned balashëv to a
chair beside him.

napoleon was in that well-known after-dinner mood which, more than
any reasoned cause, makes a man contented with himself and disposed to
consider everyone his friend. it seemed to him that he was surrounded
by men who adored him: and he felt convinced that, after his dinner,
balashëv too was his friend and worshiper. napoleon turned to him with a
pleasant, though slightly ironic, smile.

“they tell me this is the room the emperor alexander occupied? strange,
isn’t it, general?” he said, evidentl
 
 ___________________________
 
y not doubting that this remark
would be agreeable to his hearer since it went to prove his, napoleon’s,
superiority to alexander.

balashëv made no reply and bowed his head in silence.

“yes. four days ago in this room, wintzingerode and stein were
deliberating,” continued napoleon with the same derisive and
self-confident smile. “what i can’t understand,” he went on, “is that
the emperor alexander has surrounded himself with my personal enemies.
that i do not... understand. has he not thought that i may do the same?”
and he turned inquiringly to balashëv, and evidently this thought turned

balashëv bowed his head with an air indicating that he would like to
make his bow and leave, and only listened because he could not help
hearing what was said to him. napoleon did not notice this expression;
he treated balashëv not as an envoy from his enemy, but as a man
now fully devoted to him and who must rejoice at his former master’s
humiliation.

“and why has the emperor alexander taken command of the armies? what is
the good of that? war is my profession, but his business is to reign

responsibility?”

to have one’s ear pulled by the emperor was considered the greatest
honor and mark of favor at the french court.

“well, adorer and courtier of the emperor alexander, why don’t you say
anything?” said he, as if it was ridiculous, in his presence, to be the
adorer and courtier of anyone but himself, napoleon. “are the horses
ready for the general?” he added, with a slight inclination of his head
in reply to balashëv’s bow. “let him have mine, he has a long way to
go!”

the letter taken by balashëv was the last napoleon sent to alexander.
every detail of the interview was communicated to the russian monarch,

to a conflict with him—he knew that when he did meet him he would not
be able to resist calling him out, any more than a ravenous man can help
snatching at food. and the consciousness that the insult was not yet
avenged, that his rancor was still unspent, weighed on his heart and
poisoned the artificial tranquillity which he managed to obtain in
turkey by means of restless, plodding, and rather vainglorious and
ambitious activity.

in the year 1812, when news of the war with napoleon reached
bucharest—where kutúzov had been living for two months, passing his
days and nights with a wallachian woman—prince andrew asked kutúzov
to transfer him to the western army. kutúzov, who was already weary of
bolkónski’s activity which seemed to reproach his own idleness, very
readily let him go and gave him a mission to barclay de tolly.

before joining the western army which was then, in may, encamped at
dríssa, prince andrew visited bald hills which was directly on his way,

of the war. with pfuel was wolzogen, who expressed pfuel’s though

of a fourth opinion the most conspicuous representative was the
tsarévich, who could not forget his disillusionment at austerlitz, where
he had ridden out at the head of the guards, in his casque and cavalry
uniform as to a review, expecting to crush the french gallantly; but
unexpectedly finding himself in the front line had narrowly escaped amid
the general confusion. the men of this party had both the quality
and the defect of frankness in their opinions. they feared napoleon,
recognized his strength and their own weakness, and frankly said so.
they said: “nothing but sorrow, shame, and ruin will come of all this!
we have abandoned vílna and vítebsk and shall abandon dríssa. the only
reasonable thing left to do is to conclude peace as soon as possible,
before we are turned out of petersburg.”

this view was very general in the upper army circles and found support
also in petersburg and from the chancellor, rumyántsev, who, for other
reasons of state, was in

retirement to dríssa was a most shameful reverse and an unbroken series
of blunders. “the more mistakes that are made the better. it will at any
rate be understood all the sooner that things cannot go on like this.
what is wanted is not some barclay or other, but a man like bennigsen,
who made his mark in 1807, and to whom napoleon himself did justice—a
man whose authority would be willingly recognized, and bennigsen is the
only such man.”

the seventh party consisted of the sort of people who are always to
be found, especially around young sovereigns, and of whom there were
particularly many round alexander—generals and imperial aides-de-camp
passionately devoted to the emperor, not merely as a monarch but as a
man, adoring him sincerely and disinterestedly, as rostóv had done
in 1805, and who saw in him not only

this letter had not yet been presented to the emperor when barclay, one
day at dinner, informed bolkónski that the sovereign wished to see him
personally, to question him about turkey, and that prince andrew was to
present himself at bennigsen’s quarters at six that evening.

news was received at the emperor’s quarters that very day of a fresh
movement by napoleon which might endanger the army—news subsequently
found to be false. and that morning colonel michaud had ridden round the
dríssa fortifications with the emperor and had pointed out to him that
this fortified camp constructed by pfuel, and till then considered
a chef-d’oeuvre of tactical science which would ensure napoleon’s
destruction, was an absurdity, threatening the destruction of the
russian army.

as it were, a council to elucidate certain questions for the emperor
personally. to this semicouncil had been invited the swedish general
armfeldt, adjutant general wolzogen, wintzingerode (whom napoleon had
referred to as a renegade french subject), michaud, toll, count stein
who was not a military man at all, and pfuel himself, who, as prince
andrew had heard, was the mainspring of the whole affair. prince andrew
had an opportunity of getting a good look at him, for pfuel arrived soon
after himself and, in passing through to the drawing room, stopped a

respect by his boundless devotion to an idea. besides this, the remarks

at the council of war in 1805: there was now a panic fear of napoleon’s

from every side, and invoked his terrible name to shatter each other’s

and why do they all speak of a ‘military genius’? is a man a genius who
can order bread to be brought up at the right time and say who is to go
to the right and who to the left? it is only because military men are
invested with pomp and power and crowds of sychophants flatter power,
attributing to it qualities of genius it does not possess. the best
generals i have known were, on the contrary, stupid or absent-minded
men. bagratión was the best, napoleon himself admitted that. and of
bonaparte himself! i remember his limited, self-satisfied face on the
field of austerlitz. not only does a good army commander not need any
special qualities, on the contrary he needs the absence of the highest
and best human attributes—love, poetry, tenderness, and philosophic
inquiring doubt. he should be limited, firmly convinced that what he
is doing is very important (otherwise he will not have sufficient
patience), and only then will he be a brave leader. g

at the beginning of july more and more disquieting reports about the war
began to spread in moscow; people spoke of an appeal by the emperor to
the people, and of his coming himself from the army to moscow. and as
up to the eleventh of july no manifesto or appeal had been received,
exaggerated reports became current about them and about the position of
russia. it was said that the emperor was leaving the army because it was
in danger, it was said that smolénsk had surrendered, that napoleon had
an army of a million and only a miracle could save russia.

on the eleventh of july, which was saturday, the manifesto was received
but was not yet in print, and pierre, who was at the rostóvs’, promised
to come to dinner next day, sunday, and bring a copy of the manifesto
and appeal, which he would obtain from count rostopchín.

no longer aroused in him the former feeling of careful pity, an
ever-increasing restlessness, which he could not explain, took
possession of him. he felt that the condition he was in could not
continue long, that a catastrophe was coming which would change his
whole life, and he impatiently sought everywhere for signs of that
approaching catastrophe. one of his brother masons had revealed to
pierre the following prophecy concerning napoleon, drawn from the
revelation of st. john.

in chapter 13, verse 18, of the apocalypse, it is said:

here is wisdom. let him that hath understanding count the number of
the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred
threescore and six.

and in the fifth verse of the same chapter:

and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and
blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two
months.

the french alphabet, written out with the same numerica

writing the words l’empereur napoléon in numbers, it appears that the
sum of them is 666, and that napoleon was therefore the beast foretold
in the apocalypse. moreover, by applying the same system to the words
quarante-deux, * which was the term allowed to the beast that “spoke
great things and blasphemies,” the same number 666 was obtained; from
which it followed that the limit fixed for napoleon’s power had come
in the year 1812 when the french emperor was forty-two. this prophecy
pleased pierre very much and he often asked himself what would put an
end to the power of the beast, that is, of

same system of using letters as numbers and adding them up, to find an
answer to the question that engrossed him. he wrote the words l’empereur
alexandre, la nation russe and added up their numbers, but the sums
were either more or less than 666. once when making such calculations he
wrote down his own name in french, comte pierre besouhoff, but the
sum of the numbers did not come right. then he changed the spelling,
substituting a z for the s and adding de and the article l

represented by e, the very letter elided from the article le before the
word empereur. by omitting the e, though incorrectly, pierre got the
answer he sought. l’russe besuhof made 666. this discovery excited him.
how, or by what means, he was connected with the great event foretold in
the apocalypse he did not know, but he did not doubt that connection for
a moment. his love for natásha, antichrist, napoleon, the invasion, the
comet, 666, l’empereur napoléon, and l’russe besuhof—all this had to
mature and culminate, to lift him out of that spellbound, petty sphere
of moscow habits in which he felt himself held captive and lead him to a
great achievement and great happiness.

his conversation with count rostopchín and the latter’s tone of anxious
hurry, the meeting with the courier who talked casually of how badly
things were going in the army, the rumors of the discovery of spies in
moscow and of a leaflet in circulation stating that napoleon promised
to be in both the russian capitals by the autumn, and the talk of the
emperor’s being expected to arrive next day—all aroused with fresh force
that feeling of agitation and expectation in pierre which he had been
conscious of ever since the appearance of the comet, and especially
since the beginning of the war.

without some groans gave orders to their stewards about the enrollment,
feeling amazed themselves at what they had done.





book ten: 1812





chapter i

napoleon began the war with russia because he could not resist going
to dresden, could not help having his head turned by the homage he
received, could not help donning a polish uniform and yielding to the
stimulating influence of a june morning, and could not refrain from
bursts of anger in the presence of kurákin and then of balashëv.

alexander refused negotiations because he felt himself to be personally
insulted. barclay de tolly tried to command the army in the best
way, because he wished to ful

the actors of 1812 have long since left the stage, their personal
interests have vanished leaving no trace, and nothing remains of that
time but its historic results.

providence compelled all these men, striving to attain personal aims, to
further the accomplishment of a stupendous result no one of them at all
expected—neither napoleon, nor alexander, nor still less any of those
who did the actual fighting.

the cause of the destruction of the french army in 1812 is clear to us
now. no one will deny that that cause was, on the one hand, its advance
into the heart of russia late in the season without any preparation for
a winter campaign and, on the other, the character given to the war
by the burning of russian towns and the hatred of the foe this aroused
among the russian people. but no one at the time foresaw (what now seem

s
so evident) that this was the only way an army of eight hundred thousand
men—the best in the world and led by the best general—could be destroyed
in conflict with a raw army of half its numerical strength, and led by
inexperienced commanders as the russian army was. not only did no one
see this, but on the russian side every effort was made to hinder the
only thing that could save russia, while on the french side, despite
napoleon’s experience and so-called military genius, every effort was
directed to pushing on to moscow at the end of the summer, that is, to
doing the very thing that was bound to lead to destruction.

in historical works on the year 1812 french writers are very fond of
saying that napoleon felt the danger of extending his line, that he
sought a battle and that his marshals advised him to stop at smolénsk,
and of making similar statements to show that the danger of the campaign
was even then understo

od. russian authors are still fonder of telling
us that from the commencement of the campaign a scythian war plan was
adopted to lure napoleon into the depths of russia, and this plan some
of them attribute to pfuel, others to a certain frenchman, others to
toll, and others again to alexander himself—pointing to notes, projects,
and letters which contain hints of such a line of action. but all these
hints at what happened, both from the french side and the russian, are
advanced only because they fit in with the event. had that event not
occurred these hints would have been forgotten, as we have forgotten the
thousands and millions o

f hints and expectations to the contrary
which were current then but have now been forgotten because the event
falsified them. there are always so many conjectures as to the issue of
any event that however it may end there will always be people to say:
“i said then that it would be so,” quite forgetting that amid their
innumerable conjectures many were to quite the contrary effect.

conjectures as to napoleon’s awareness of the danger of extending his
line, and (on the russian side) as to luring the enemy into the depths
of russia, are evidently of that kind, and only by much straining can
historians attribute such conceptions to napoleon and his marshals,
or such plans to the russian commanders. all the facts are in flat
contradiction to such conjectures. during the whole period of the war
not only was there no wish on the russian side to draw the french
into the heart of the country, but from th

eir first entry into russia
everything was done to stop them. and not only was napoleon not afraid
to extend his line, but he welcomed every step forward as a triumph and
did not seek battle as eagerly as in former campaigns, but very lazily.

at the very beginning of the war our armies were divided, and our sole
aim was to unite them, though uniting the armies was no advantage if we
meant to retire and lure the enemy into the depths of the country. our
emperor joined the army to encourage it to defend every inch of russian
soil and not to retreat. the enormous dríssa camp was fo

 the commanders in chief for every step they retired. he could
not bear the idea of letting the enemy even reach smolénsk, still less
could he contemplate the burning of moscow, and when our armies did
unite he was displeased that smolénsk was abandoned and burned without a
general engagement having been fought under its walls.

so thought the emperor, and the russian commanders and people were still
more provoked at the thought that our forces were retreating into the
depths of the country.

napoleon having cut our armies apart advanced far into the country and
missed several chances of forcing an engagement. in august he was at
smolénsk and thought only of how to advance farther, though as we now
see that advance was evidently ruinous to him.

the facts clearly show that napoleon did not foresee the danger of the
advance on moscow, nor did alexander and the russian commanders then
think of luring napoleon on, but quite the contrary. the luring of
napoleon into the depths of the country wa

it was necessary to fight an unexpected battle at smolénsk to save our
lines of communication. the battle was fought and thousands were killed
on both sides.

smolénsk was abandoned contrary to the wishes of the emperor and of the
whole people. but smolénsk was burned by its own inhabitants-who had
been misled by their governor. and these ruined inhabitants, setting
an example to other russians, went to moscow thinking only of their own
losses but kindling hatred of the foe. napoleon advanced farther and we
retired, thus arriving at the very result which caused his destruction.

cannon balls and bursting shells falling on the town. but these sounds
were hardly heard in comparison with the noise of the firing outside the
town and attracted little attention from the inhabitants. the town was
being bombarded by a hundred and thirty guns which napoleon had ordered
up after four o’clock. the people did not at once realize the meaning of
this bombardment.

at first the noise of the falling bombs and shells only aroused
curiosity. ferapóntov’s wife, who till then had not ceased wailing under
the shed, became quiet and with the baby in her arms went to the gate,

i expect the minister (barclay de tolly) has already reported the

the whole army is in despair that this most important place has been

and finally wrote him, but nothing would induce him to consent. i swear
to you on my honor that napoleon was in such a fix as never before and
might have lost half his army but could not have taken smolénsk. our
troops fought, and are fighting, as never before. with fifteen thousand
men i held the enemy at bay for thirty-five hours and beat him; but he
would not hold out even for fourteen hours. it is disgraceful, a stain
on our army, and as for him, he ought, it seems to me, not to live. if

effect that one ought not to go to the french theater and that to

the reports most flattering to our army were circulated. in the french

enemy and of the war were contradicted and all napoleon’s attempts at
conciliation were discussed. in that circle they discountenanced those
who advised hurried preparations for a removal to kazán of the court and
the girls’ educational establishments under the patronage of the dowager
empress. in hélène’s circle the war in general was regarded as a series

while this was taking place in petersburg the french had already passed
smolénsk and were drawing nearer and nearer to moscow. napoleon’s
historian thiers, like other of his historians, trying to justify his
hero says that he was drawn to the walls of moscow against his will. he
is as right as other historians who look for the explanation of historic
events in the will of one man; he is as right as the russian historians
who maintain that napoleon was drawn to moscow by the skill of the
russian commanders. here besides the law of retrospection, which regards
all the past as a preparation for events that subsequently occur,

opening, but forgets that at each stage of the game there were similar
mistakes and that none of his moves were perfect. he only notices the
mistake to which he pays attention, because his opponent took advantage
of it. how much more complex than this is the game of war, which
occurs under certain limits of time, and where it is not one will that
manipulates lifeless objects, but everything results from innumerable
conflicts of various wills!

after smolénsk napoleon sought a battle beyond dorogobúzh at vyázma, and
then at tsárevo-zaymíshche, but it happened that owing to a conjunction
of innumerable circumstances the russians could not give battle till
they reached borodinó, seventy miles from moscow. from vyázma napoleon
ordered a direct advance on moscow.

off, and an hour later, lavrúshka, the serf denísov had handed over
to rostóv, rode up to napoleon in an orderly’s jacket and on a french
cavalry saddle, with a merry, and tipsy face. napoleon told him to ride
by his side and began questioning him.

“you are a cossack?”

“yes, a cossack, your honor.”

“the cossack, not knowing in what company he was, for napoleon’s plain
appearance had nothing about it that would reveal to an oriental mind
the presence of a monarch, talked with extreme familiarity of the
incidents of the war,” says thiers, narrating this episode. in
reality lavrúshka, having got drunk the day before and left his master
dinnerless, had been whipped and sent to the village in quest of
chickens, where he engaged in looting till the french took him prisoner.

cunning way, are ready to render any sort of service to their master,
and are keen at guessing their master’s baser impulses, especially those
prompted by vanity and pettiness.

finding himself in the company of napoleon, whose identity he had easily
and surely recognized, lavrúshka was not in the least abashed but merely
did his utmost to gain his new master’s favor.

he knew very well that this was napoleon, but napoleon’s presence could
no more intimidate him than rostóv’s, or a sergeant major’s with the
rods, would have done, for he had nothing that either the sergeant major
or napoleon could deprive him of.

so he rattled on, telling all the gossip he had heard among the

in everything, so he frowned and did not answer immediately.

“it’s like this,” he said thoughtfully, “if there’s a battle soon, yours
will win. that’s right. but if three days pass, then after that, well,
then that same battle will not soon be over.”

lelorgne d’ideville smilingly interpreted this speech to napoleon thus:
“if a battle takes place within the next three days the french will
win, but if later, god knows what will happen.” napoleon did not smile,
though he was evidently in high good humor, and he ordered these words
to be repeated.

lavrúshka noticed this and to entertain him further, pretending not to
know who napoleon was, added:

“we know that you have bonaparte and that he has beaten everybody in the
world, but we are a different matter...”—without knowing why or how this
bit of boastful patriotism slipped out at the end.

the interpreter translated these words without the last phrase, and
bonaparte smiled. “

the young cossack made his mighty interlocutor
smile,” says thiers. after riding a few paces in silence, napoleon
turned to berthier and said he wished to see how the news that he was
talking to the emperor himself, to that very emperor who had written his
immortally victorious name on the pyramids, would affect this enfant du
don. *

* “child of the don.”


the fact was accordingly conveyed to lavrúshka.

lavrúshka, understanding that this was done to perplex him and that
napoleon expected him to be frightened, to gratify his new masters
promptly pretended to be astonished and awe-struck, opened his eyes
wide, and assumed the expression he usually put on when taken to be
whipped. “as soon as napoleon’s interpreter had spoken,” says thiers,
“the cossack, seized by amazement, did not utter another word, but rode
on, his eyes fixed on the conqueror whose fame had reached him across
the steppes of the east. all his loquacity was suddenly arrested and
replaced by a na

making the cossack a present, had him set free like a bird restored to
its native fields.”

napoleon rode on, dreaming of the moscow that so appealed to his
imagination, and “the bird restored to its native fields” galloped to
our outposts, inventing on the way all that had not taken place but that
he meant to relate to his comrades. what had really taken place he did
not wish to relate because it seemed to him not worth telling. he
found the cossacks, inquired for the regiment operating with plátov’s
detachment and by evening found his master, nicholas rostóv, quartered
at yankóvo. r

uchárovo had lain between the two hostile
armies, so that it was as easy for the russian rearguard to get to it as
for the french vanguard; rostóv, as a careful squadron commander, wished
to take such provisions as remained at boguchárovo before the french
could get them.

rostóv and ilyín were in the merriest of moods. on the way to
boguchárovo, a princely estate with a dwelling house and farm where
they hoped to find many domestic serfs and pretty girls, they questioned
lavrúshka about napoleon and laughed at his stories, and raced one
another to try ilyín’s horse.

rostóv had no idea that the village he was entering was the property of
that very bolkónski who had been engaged to his sister.

rostóv and ilyín gave rein to their horses for a last race along the
incline before reaching boguchárovo, and rostóv, outstripping ilyín, was
the first to gallop into the village street.

“you’re first!” cried ilyín, flushed.

“yes, always first both on the grassland and here,

and scanty beards emerged from the tavern, smiling, staggering, and
singing some incoherent song, and approached the officers.

“fine fellows!” said rostóv laughing. “is there any hay here?”

“and how like one another,” said ilyín.

“a mo-o-st me-r-r-y co-o-m-pa...!” sang one of the peasants with a
blissful smile.

one of the men came out of the crowd and went up to rostóv.

“who do you belong to?” he asked.

“the french,” replied ilyín jestingly, “and here is napoleon
himself”—and he pointed to lavrúshka.

“then you are russians?” the peasant asked again.

“and is there a large force of you here?” said another, a short man,
coming up.

“very large,” answered rostóv. “but why have you collected here?” he
added. “is it a holiday?”

“the old men have met to talk over the business of the commune,” replied
the peasant, moving away.

at that moment, on the road leading from the big house, two women and a

portfolio under his arm really did appear.

“what?” said kutúzov, in the midst of denísov’s explanations, “are you
ready so soon?”

“ready, your serene highness,” replied the general.

kutúzov swayed his head, as much as to say: “how is one man to deal with
it all?” and again listened to denísov.

“i give my word of honor as a wussian officer,” said denísov, “that i

“what relation are you to intendant general kiríl andréevich denísov?”
asked kutúzov, interrupting him.

“he is my uncle, your sewene highness.”

“ah, we were friends,” said kutúzov cheerfully. “all right, all right,
friend, stay here at the staff and tomorrow we’ll have a talk.”

with a nod to denísov he turned away and put out his hand for the papers
konovnítsyn had brought him.

better to disregard what is painful till it comes, and to
think about what is pleasant. in solitude a man generally listens to
the first voice, but in society to the second. so it was now with the
inhabitants of moscow. it was long since people had been as gay in
moscow as that year.

rostopchín’s broadsheets, headed by woodcuts of a drink shop, a potman,
and a moscow burgher called karpúshka chigírin, “who—having been a
militiaman and having had rather too much at the pub—heard that napoleon
wished to come to moscow, grew angry, abused the french in very bad
language, came out of the drink shop, and, under the sign of the
eagle, began to address the assembled people,” were read and discussed,
together with the latest of vasíli lvóvich púshkin’s bouts rimés.

in the corner room at the club, members gathered to read these
broadsheets, and some liked the way karpúshka jeered at the french,
saying: “they will swell up with russian cabbage, burst with our
buckwheat porridge,

and choke themselves with cabbage soup. they are all
dwarfs and one peasant woman will toss three of them with a hayfork.”
others did not like that tone and said it was stupid and vulgar. it was
said that rostopchín had expelled all frenchmen and even all foreigners
from moscow, and that there had been some spies and agents of napoleon
among them; but this was told chiefly to introduce rostopchín’s witty
remark on that occasion. the foreigners were deported to nízhni by
boat, and rostopchín had said to them in french: “rentrez en vous-mêmes;
entrez dans la barque, et n’en faites pas une barque de charon.” * there
was talk of all the government offices having been already removed from
moscow, and to this shinshín’s witticism was added—that for that alone
moscow ought to be grateful to napoleon. it was said tha

was the battle of borodinó fought? there was not the least
sense in it for either the french or the russians. its immediate result
for the russians was, and was bound to be, that we were brought nearer
to the destruction of moscow—which we feared more than anything in
the world; and for the french its immediate result was that they were
brought nearer to the destruction of their whole army—which they feared
more than anything in the world. what the result must be was quite
obvious, and yet napoleon offered and kutúzov accepted that battle.

if the commanders had been guided by reason, it would seem that it must
have been obvious to napoleon that by advancing thirteen hundred miles
and giving battle with a probability of losing a quarter of his army,
he was advancing to certain destruction, and it must have been equally
clear to kutúzov that by accepting battle and risking the loss of a
quarter of his army he would certainly lose moscow. for kutúzov this was
mathematically clear, as it

before the battle of borodinó our strength in proportion to the french
was about as five to six, but after that battle it was little more than
one to two: previously we had a hundred thousand against a hundred and
twenty thousand; afterwards little more than fifty thousand against a
hundred thousand. yet the shrewd and experienced kutúzov accepted the
battle, while napoleon, who was said to be a commander of genius,
gave it, losing a quarter of his army and lengthening his lines of
communication still more. if it is said that he expected to end the
campaign by occupying moscow as he had ended a previous campaign by
occupying vienna, there is much evidence to the contrary. napoleon’s
historians themselves tell us that from smolénsk onwards he wished
to stop, knew the danger of his extended position, and knew that the
occupation of moscow would not be the end of

reat from smolénsk sought out
for itself the best position for a general engagement and found such a
position at borodinó.

the russians, they say, fortified this position in advance on the left
of the highroad (from moscow to smolénsk) and almost at a right angle
to it, from borodinó to utítsa, at the very place where the battle was
fought.

in front of this position, they say, a fortified outpost was set up on
the shevárdino mound to observe the enemy. on the twenty-fourth, we
are told, napoleon attacked this advanced post and took it, and, on the
twenty-sixth, attacked the whole russian army, which was in position on
the field of borodinó.

so the histories say, and it is all quite wrong, as anyone who cares to
look into the matter can easily convince himself.

the russians did not seek out the best position but, on the contrary,
during the retreat passed many positions better than borodinó. they did
not stop at any one of these positions because kutúzov did not wish to
occupy a po

ighroad not at a right angle but at an acute
angle—so that the left flank was at shevárdino, the right flank near the
village of nóvoe, and the center at borodinó at the confluence of the
rivers kolochá and vóyna.

to anyone who looks at the field of borodinó without thinking of how
the battle was actually fought, this position, protected by the river
kolochá, presents itself as obvious for an army whose object was to
prevent an enemy from advancing along the smolénsk road to moscow.

napoleon, riding to valúevo on the twenty-fourth, did not see (as the
history books say he did) the position of the russians from utítsa
to borodinó (he could not have seen that position because it did not
exist), nor did he see an advanced post of the russian army, but while
pursuing the russian rearguard he came upon the left flank of the
russian position—at the shevárdino redoubt—and unexpectedly for the
russians moved his army across the kolochá. and the russians, not having
time to begin a

 general engagement, withdrew their left wing from the
position they had intended to occupy and took up a new position which
had not been foreseen and was not fortified. by crossing to the other
side of the kolochá to the left of the highroad, napoleon shifted the
whole forthcoming battle from right to left (looking from the russian
side) and transferred it to the plain between utítsa, semënovsk, and
borodinó—a plain no more advantageous as a position than any other plain
in russia—and there the whole battle of the twenty-sixth of august took
place.

e would have doubted that
the shevárdino redoubt was the left flank of our position, and the
battle would have taken place where we expected it. in that case
we should probably have defended the shevárdino redoubt—our left
flank—still more obstinately. we should have attacked napoleon in the
center or on the right, and the engagement would have taken place on the
twenty-fifth, in the position we intended and had fortified. but as the
attack on our left flank took place in the evening after the retreat of
our rear guard (that is, immediately after the fight at gridnëva), and
as the russian commanders did not wish, or were not in time, to begin a
general engagement then on the evening of the twenty-fourth, the first

an amphitheater, extended before him in the clear rarefied atmosphere.

from above on the left, bisecting that amphitheater, wound the smolénsk
highroad, passing through a village with a white church some five
hundred paces in front of the knoll and below it. this was borodinó.
below the village the road crossed the river by a bridge and, winding
down and up, rose higher and higher to the village of valúevo visible
about four miles away, where napoleon was then stationed. beyond valúevo
the road disappeared into a yellowing forest on the horizon. far in
the distance in that birch and fir forest to the right of the road, the
cross and belfry of the kolochá monastery gleamed in the sun. here and
there over the whole of that blue expanse, to right and left of the
forest and the road, smoking campfires could be seen and indefinite

downhill and uphill, across a ryefield trodden and beaten down as if by

of the plowed land, and reached some flèches * which were still being
dug.

at the flèches bennigsen stopped and began looking at the shevárdino
redoubt opposite, which had been ours the day before and where several
horsemen could be descried. the officers said that either napoleon or
murat was there, and they all gazed eagerly at this little group of
horsemen. pierre also looked at them, trying to guess which of the
scarcely discernible figures was napoleon. at last those mounted men
rode away from the mound and disappeared.

bennigsen spoke to a general who approached him, and began explaining
the whole position of our troops. pierre listened to him, straining each
faculty to understand the essential points of the impending battle, but
was mortified to feel that his men

accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously. it all lies in

chapter xxvi

on august 25, the eve of the battle of borodinó, m. de beausset, prefect
of the french emperor’s palace, arrived at napoleon’s quarters at
valúevo with colonel fabvier, the former from paris and the latter from
madrid.

donning his court uniform, m. de beausset ordered a box he had
brought for the emperor to be carried before him and entered the first
compartment of napoleon’s tent, where he began opening the box while
conversing with napoleon’s aides-de-camp who surrounded him.

fabvier, not entering the tent, remained at the entrance talking to some
generals of his acquaintance.

the emperor napoleon had not

 yet left his bedroom and was finishing his
toilet. slightly snorting and grunting, he presented now his back and
now his plump hairy chest to the brush with which his valet was rubbing
him down. another valet, with his finger over the mouth of a bottle,
was sprinkling eau de cologne on the emperor’s pampered body with an
expression which seemed to say that he alone knew where and how much eau
de cologne should be sprinkled. napoleon’s short hair was wet and
matted on the forehead, but his face, though puffy and yellow, expressed
physical satisfaction. “go on, harder, go on!” he muttered to the valet
who was rubbing him, slightly twitching and grunting. an aide-de-camp,
who had entered the bedroom to report to the emperor the number of
prisoners taken in yesterday’s action, was standing by the door after
delivering his message, awaiting permission to withdraw. napoleon,
frowning, looked at him from under his brows.

 fat shoulders.

“all right. let monsieur de beausset enter, and fabvier too,” he said,
nodding to the aide-de-camp.

“yes, sire,” and the aide-de-camp disappeared through the door of the
tent.

two valets rapidly dressed his majesty, and wearing the blue uniform of
the guards he went with firm quick steps to the reception room.

de beausset’s hands meanwhile were busily engaged arranging the present
he had brought from the empress, on two chairs directly in front of the
entrance. but napoleon had dressed and come out with such unexpected
rapidity that he had not time to finish arranging the surprise.

napoleon noticed at once what they were about and guessed that they were
not ready. he did not wish to deprive them of the pleasure of giving him
a surprise, so he pretended not to see de beausset and called fabvier to
him, listening silently and with a stern frown to what fabvier told him
of the heroism and devotion of his troops fighting at salamanca, at
the other end of europe, with

 but one thought—to be worthy of their
emperor—and but one fear—to fail to please him. the result of that
battle had been deplorable. napoleon made ironic remarks during
fabvier’s account, as if he had not expected that matters could go
otherwise in his absence.

“i must make up for that in moscow,” said napoleon. “i’ll see you
later,” he added, and summoned de beausset, who by that time had
prepared the surprise, having placed something on the chairs and covered
it with a cloth.

de beausset bowed low, with that courtly french bow which only the
old retainers of the bourbons knew how to make, and approached him,
presenting an envelope.

napoleon turned to him gaily and pulled his ear.

“you have hurried here. i am very glad. well, what is paris saying?” he
asked, suddenly changing his former 
 
 ___________________________
 
stern expression for a most cordial
tone.

“sire, all paris regrets your absence,” replied de beausset as was
proper.

but though napoleon knew that de beausset had to say something of this
kind, and though in his lucid moments he knew it was untrue, he was
pleased to hear it from him. again he honored him by touching his ear.

“i am very sorry to have made you travel so far,” said he.

“sire, i expected nothing less than to find you at the gates of moscow,”
replied de beausset.

napoleon smiled and, lifting his head absent-mindedly, glanced to the
right. an aide-de-camp approached with gliding steps and offered him a
gold snuffbox, which he took.

“yes, it has happened luckily for you,” he said, raising the open
snuffbox to his nose. “you are fond of travel, and in three days you
will see moscow. you surely did not expect to see that asiatic capital.
you will have a pleasant journey.”

de beausset bowed gratefully at this regard for his taste for travel (of
which he had
 
 ___________________________
 
 not till then been aware).

“ha, what’s this?” asked napoleon, noticing that all the courtiers were
looking at something concealed under a cloth.

with courtly adroitness de beausset half turned and without turning his
back to the emperor retired two steps, twitching off the cloth at the
same time, and said:

“a present to your majesty from the empress.”

it was a portrait, painted in bright colors by gérard, of the son borne
to napoleon by the daughter of the emperor of austria, the boy whom for
some reason everyone called “the king of rome.”

a very pretty curly-headed boy with a look of the christ in the sistine
madonna was depicted playing at stick and ball. the ball represented the
terrestrial globe and the stick in his other hand a scepter.

though it was not clear what the artist meant to express by depicting
the so-called king of rome spiking the earth with a stick, the allegory
apparently seemed to napoleon, as it

emotion.

having sat still for a while he touched—himself not knowing why—the
thick spot of paint representing the highest light in the portrait,
rose, and recalled de beausset and the officer on duty. he ordered the
portrait to be carried outside his tent, that the old guard, stationed
round it, might not be deprived of the pleasure of seeing the king of
rome, the son and heir of their adored monarch.

and while he was doing m. de beausset the honor of breakfasting with
him, they heard, as napoleon had anticipated, the rapturous cries of the
officers and men of the old guard who had run up to see the portrait.

“vive l’empereur! vive le roi de rome! vive l’empereur!” came those
ecstatic cries.

after breakfast napoleon in de beausset’s presence dictated his order of
the day to the army.

“short and energetic!” he remarked when he had read over the
proclamation which he had dictated straight off without corrections. it
ran:

soldiers! this is the battle you have so longed for

you. it is essential for us; it will give us all we need: comfortable
quarters and a speedy return to our country. behave as you did at
austerlitz, friedland, vítebsk, and smolénsk. let our remotest posterity
recall your achievements this day with pride. let it be said of each of
you: “he was in the great battle before moscow!”

“before moscow!” repeated napoleon, and inviting m. de beausset, who was
so fond of travel, to accompany him on his ride, he went out of the tent
to where the horses stood saddled.

“your majesty is too kind!” replied de beausset to the invitation to
accompany the emperor; he wanted to sleep, did not know how to ride and
was afraid of doing so.

but napoleon nodded to the traveler, and de beausset had to mount. when
napoleon came out of the tent the shouting of the guards before his
son’s portrait grew still louder. napole

on frowned.

“take him away!” he said, pointing with a gracefully majestic gesture to
the portrait. “it is too soon for him to see a field of battle.”

de beausset closed his eyes, bowed his head, and sighed deeply, to
indicate how profoundly he valued and comprehended the emperor’s words.





chapter xxvii

on the twenty-fifth of august, so his historians tell us, napoleon spent
the whole day on horseback inspecting the locality, considering plans
submitted to him by his marshals, and personally giving commands to his
generals.

the original line of the russian forces along the river kolochá had
been dislocated by the capture of the shevárdino redoubt on the
twenty-fourth, and part of the line—the left flank—had been drawn back.
that part of the line was not entrenched and in front of it the ground
was more open and level than elsewhere. it was evident to a
 
 ___________________________
 
nyone,
military or not, that it was here the french should attack. it would
seem that not much consideration was needed to reach this conclusion,
nor any particular care or trouble on the part of the emperor and his
marshals, nor was there any need of that special and supreme quality
called genius that people are so apt to ascribe to napoleon; yet the
historians who described the event later and the men who then surrounded
napoleon, and he himself, thought otherwise.

napoleon rode over the plain and surveyed the locality with a profound
air and in silence, nodded with approval or shook his head dubiously,
and without communicating to the generals around him the profound
course of ideas which guided his decisions merely gave them his final
conclusions in the form of commands. having listened to a suggestion
from davout, who was now called prince d’eckmühl, to turn the russian
left wing, napoleon said it should not be done, without explaining
why not. to a proposal

 made by general campan (who was to attack the
flèches) to lead his division through the woods, napoleon agreed, though
the so-called duke of elchingen (ney) ventured to remark that a movement
through the woods was dangerous and might disorder the division.

having inspected the country opposite the shevárdino redoubt, napoleon
pondered a little in silence and then indicated the spots where two
batteries should be set up by the morrow to act against the russian
entrenchments, and the places where, in line with them, the field
artillery should be placed.

after giving these and other commands he returned to his tent, and the
dispositions for the battle were written down from his dictation.

these dispositions, of which the french historians write with enthusiasm
and other historians with profound respect, were as follo

me heights as morand’s and gibrard’s divisions, which
under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt and come into
line with the rest of the forces.

all this must be done in good order (le tout se fera avec ordre et
méthode) as far as possible retaining troops in reserve.

the imperial camp near mozháysk,

september, 6, 1812.

these dispositions, which are very obscure and confused if one allows
oneself to regard the arrangements without religious awe of his genius,
related to napoleon’s orders to deal with four points—four different
orders. not one of these was, or could be, carried out.

in the disposition it is said first that the batteries placed on the
spot chosen by napoleon, with the guns of pernetti and fouché; which
were to come in line with them, 102 guns in all, were to open fire and
shower shells on the russian flèches and redoubts. this could not be
done, as from the spots selected by napoleon the projectiles did not
carry to the russian works, and those 10

2 guns shot into the air until
the nearest commander, contrary to napoleon’s instructions, moved them
forward.

the second order was that poniatowski, moving to the village through the
wood, should turn the russian left flank. this could not be done and
was not done, because poniatowski, advancing on the village through the
wood, met túchkov there barring his way, and could not and did not turn
the russian position.

the third order was: general campan will move through the wood to seize
the first fortification. general campan’s division did not seize the
first f

ortification but was driven back, for on emerging from the wood
it had to reform under grapeshot, of which napoleon was unaware.

the fourth order was: the vice-king will occupy the village (borodinó)
and cross by its three bridges, advancing to the same heights as
morand’s and gérard’s divisions (for whose movements no directions are
given), which under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt
and come into line with the rest of the forces.

as far as one can make out, not so much from this unintelligible

redoubt while the divisions of morand and gérard were to advance
simultaneously from the front.

all this, like the other parts of the disposition, was not and could
not be executed. after passing through borodinó the vice-king was driven
back to the kolochá and could get no farther; while the divisions of
morand and gérard did not take the redoubt but were driven back, and the
redoubt was only taken at the end of the battle by the cavalry (a thing
probably unforeseen and not heard of by napoleon). so not one of
the orders in the disposition was, or could be, executed. but in the
disposition it is said that, after the fight has commenced in this
manner, orders will be given in accordance with the enemy’s movements,
and so it might be supposed that all necessary arrangements would be
made by napoleon during the battle. but this was not and could not be
done, for during the whole battle napoleon was so far away that, as
appeared later, he could not know the course of the battle and not

of his orders during the fight could be executed.





chapter xxviii

many historians say that the french did not win the battle of borodinó
because napoleon had a cold, and that if he had not had a cold the
orders he gave before and during the battle would have been still more
full of genius and russia would have been lost and the face of the world
have been changed. to historians who believe that russia was shaped
by the will of one man—peter the great—and that france from a republic
became an empire and french armies went to russia at the will of one
man—napoleon—to say that russia remained a power because napoleon had a
bad cold on the t

wenty-fourth of august may seem logical and convincing.

if it had depended on napoleon’s will to fight or not to fight the
battle of borodinó, and if this or that other arrangement depended on
his will, then evidently a cold affecting the manifestation of his will
might have saved russia, and consequently the valet who omitted to bring
napoleon his waterproof boots on the twenty-fourth would have been
the savior of russia. along that line of thought such a deduction is
indubitable, as indubitable as the deduction voltaire made in jest
(without knowing what he was jesting at) when he saw that the massacre
of st. bartholomew was due to charles ix’s stomach being deranged. but
to men who do not admit that russia was formed by the will of one man,
peter i, or that the french empire was formed and the war with russia
begun by the will of
 
 ___________________________
 
 one man, napoleon, that argument seems not merely
untrue and irrational, but contrary to all human reality. to the
question of what causes historic events another answer presents itself,
namely, that the course of human events is predetermined from on
high—depends on the coincidence of the wills of all who take part in the
events, and that a napoleon’s influence on the course of these events is
purely external and fictitious.

strange as at first glance it may seem to suppose that the massacre of
st. bartholomew was not due to charles ix’s will, though he gave the
order for it and thought it was done as a result of that order; and
strange as it may seem to suppose that the slaughter of eighty thousand
men at borodinó was not due to napoleon’s will, though he ordered the
commencement and conduct of the battle and thought it was done
b
 
 ___________________________
 
ecause he ordered it; strange as these suppositions appear, yet human
dignity—which tells me that each of us is, if not more at least not less
a man than the great napoleon—demands the acceptance of that solution of
the question, and historic investigation abundantly confirms it.

at the battle of borodinó napoleon shot at no one and killed no one.
that was all done by the soldiers. therefore it was not he who killed
people.

the french soldiers went to kill and be killed at the battle of borodinó
not because of napoleon’s orders but by their own volition. the whole
army—french, italian, german, polish, and dutch—hungry, ragged, and
weary of the campaign, felt at the sight of an army blocking their road
to moscow that the wine was drawn and must be drunk. had napoleon then
forbidden them to fight t

he russians, they would have killed him and
have proceeded to fight the russians because it was inevitable.

when they heard napoleon’s proclamation offering them, as compensation
for mutilation and death, the words of posterity about their having been
in the battle before moscow, they cried “vive l’empereur!” just as they
had cried “vive l’empereur!” at the sight of the portrait of the boy
piercing the terrestrial globe with a toy stick, and just as they would
have cried “vive l’empereur!” at any nonsense that might be told them.
there was nothing left for them to do but cry “vive l’empereur!” and g

o
to fight, in order to get food and rest as conquerors in moscow. so it
was not because of napoleon’s commands that they killed their fellow
men.

and it was not napoleon who directed the course of the battle, for none
of his orders were executed and during the battle he did not know what
was going on before him. so the way in which these people killed one
another was not decided by napoleon’s will but occurred independently of
him, in accord with the will of hundreds of thousands of people who took
part in the common action. it only seemed to napoleon that it all took
place by his will. and so the question whether he had or had not a
cold has no more historic interest than the cold of the least of the
transport soldiers.

moreover, the assertion made by various writers that his cold was
the cause of his dispositions not being as well-planned as on former
occasions, and of his or
 
 ___________________________
 
ders during the battle not being as good as
previously, is quite baseless, which again shows that napoleon’s cold on
the twenty-sixth of august was unimportant.

the dispositions cited above are not at all worse, but are even
better, than previous dispositions by which he had won victories. his
pseudo-orders during the battle were also no worse than formerly, but
much the same as usual. these dispositions and orders only seem worse
than previous ones because the battle of borodinó was the first napoleon
did not win. the profoundest and most excellent dispositions and orders
seem very bad, and eve

rist criticizes them with looks
of importance, when they relate to a battle that has been lost, and the
very worst dispositions and orders seem very good, and serious people
fill whole volumes to demonstrate their merits, when they relate to a
battle that has been won.

the dispositions drawn up by weyrother for the battle of austerlitz were
a model of perfection for that kind of composition, but still they were
criticized—criticized for their very perfection, for their excessive
minuteness.

napoleon at the battle of borodinó fulfilled his office as
representative of authority as well as, and even better than, at other
battles. he did nothing harmful to the progress of the battle; he
inclined to the most reasonable opinions, he made no confusion, did not
contradict himself, did not get frightened or run away from the field of
battle, but with his great tact and military experience carried out his
role of appearing to command, calmly and with dignity.

second inspection of the lines, napoleon remarked:

“the chessmen are set up, the game will begin tomorrow!”

having ordered punch and summoned de beausset, he began to talk to him
about paris and about some changes he meant to make in the empress’
household, surprising the prefect by his memory of minute details
relating to the court.

he showed an interest in trifles, joked about de beausset’s love of
travel, and chatted carelessly, as a famous, self-confident surgeon who

set to work i shall do it as no one else could, but now i can jest, and
the more i jest and the calmer i am the more tranquil and confident you
ought to be, and the more amazed at my genius.”

having finished his second glass of punch, napoleon went to rest before
the serious business which, he considered, awaited him next day. he
was so much interested in that task that he was unable to sleep, and
in spite of his cold which had grown worse from the dampness of the
evening, he went into the large division of the tent at three o’clock in
the morning, loudly blowing his nose. he asked whether the russians had
not withdrawn, and was told that the enemy’s fires were still in the
same places. he nodded approval.

the adjutant in attend

ance came into the tent.

“well, rapp, do you think we shall do good business today?” napoleon
asked him.

“without doubt, sire,” replied rapp.

napoleon looked at him.

“do you remember, sire, what you did me the honor to say at smolénsk?”
continued rapp. “the wine is drawn and must be drunk.”

napoleon frowned and sat silent for a long time leaning his head on his
hand.

“this poor army!” he suddenly remarked. “it has diminished greatly since
smolénsk. fortune is frankly a courtesan, rapp. i have always said so
and i am beginning to experience it. but the guards, rapp, the guards
are intact?” he remarked interrogatively.

“yes, sire,” replied rapp.

napoleon took a lozenge, put it in his mouth, and glanced at his watch.
he was not sleepy and it was still not nearly morning. it wa

to give further orders for the sake of killing time, for the orders had
all been given and were now being executed.

“have the biscuits and rice been served out to the regiments of the
guards?” asked napoleon sternly.

“yes, sire.”

“the rice too?”

rapp replied that he had given the emperor’s order about the rice, but
napoleon shook his head in dissatisfaction as if not believing that
his order had been executed. an attendant came in with punch. napoleon
ordered another glass to be brought for rapp, and silently sipped his
own.

“i have neither taste nor smell,” he remarked, sniffing at his glass.
“this cold is tiresome. they talk about medicine—what is the good of
medicine when it can’t cure a cold! corvisart gave me these lozenges but
they don’t help at all. what can doctors cure? one can’t cure anything.

our body is like a perfect watch that should go for a certain time; the
watchmaker cannot open it, he can only adjust it by fumbling, and that
blindfold.... yes, our body is just a machine for living, that is all.”

and having entered on the path of definition, of which he was fond,
napoleon suddenly and unexpectedly gave a new one.

“do you know, rapp, what military art is?” asked he. “it is the art of
being stronger than the enemy at a given moment. that’s all.”

rapp made no reply.

“tomorrow we shall have to deal with kutúzov!” said napoleon. “we shall
see! do you remember at braunau he commanded an army for three weeks
and did not once mount a horse to inspect his entrenchments.... we shall
see!”

he looked at his watch. it was still only four o’clock. he

rose, walked to and fro, put on a warm overcoat and a hat, and went
out of the tent. the night was dark and damp, a scarcely perceptible
moisture was descending from above. near by, the campfires were dimly
burning among the french guards, and in the distance those of the
russian line shone through the smoke. the weather was calm, and the
rustle and tramp of the french troops already beginning to move to take
up their positions were clearly audible.

napoleon walked about in front of his tent, looked at the fires and
listened to these sounds, and as he was passing a tall guardsman in
a shaggy cap, who was standing sentinel before his tent and had drawn
himself up like a black pillar at sight of the emperor, napoleon stopped
in front of him.

“what year did you enter the service?” he asked with that affectation
of military bluntness and geniality with which he always addressed the
soldiers.

the man answered the question.

“ah! one of the old o

nes! has your regiment had its rice?”

“it has, your majesty.”

napoleon nodded and walked away.

at half-past five napoleon rode to the village of shevárdino.

it was growing light, the sky was clearing, only a single cloud lay in
the east. the abandoned campfires were burning themselves out in the
faint morning light.

on the right a single deep report of a cannon resounded and died away in
the prevailing silence. some minutes passed. a second and a third report
shook the air, then a fourth and a fifth boomed solemnly near by on the
right.

the first shots had not yet ceased to reverberate before others rang out

napoleon with his suite rode up to the shevárdino redoubt where he
dismounted. the game had begun.

on returning to górki after having seen prince andrew, pierre ordered
his groom to get the horses ready and to call him early in the morning,

 on the field between borodinó and the flèches, beside the
wood, the chief action of the day took place on an open space visible
from both sides and was fought in the simplest and most artless way.

the battle began on both sides with a cannonade from several hundred
guns.

then when the whole field was covered with smoke, two divisions,
campan’s and dessaix’s, advanced from the french right, while murat’s
troops advanced on borodinó from their left.

from the shevárdino redoubt where napoleon was standing the flèches were
two thirds of a mile away, and it was more than a mile as the crow flies
to borodinó, so that napoleon could not see what was happening there,
especially as the smoke mingling with the mist hid the whole locality.
the soldiers of dessaix’s division advancing against the flèches could
only be seen till they had entered the hollow that lay between them and
the flèches. as soon as they had descended into that hollow, the smoke
of the guns and musketry on the fl

ches grew so dense that it covered
the whole approach on that side of it. through the smoke glimpses could
be caught of something black—probably men—and at times the glint of
bayonets. but whether they were moving or stationary, whether they were
french or russian, could not be discovered from the shevárdino redoubt.

the sun had risen brightly and its slanting rays struck straight into
napoleon’s face as, shading his eyes with his hand, he looked at the
flèches. the smoke spread out before them, and at times it looked as if
the smoke were moving, at times as if the troops moved. sometimes shouts
were heard through the firing, but it was impossible to tell what was
being done there.

napoleon, standing on the knoll, looked through a field glass, and in
its small circlet saw smoke and men, sometimes his own and sometimes
russians, but when he looked again with the naked eye, he could

ther, dead, wounded, alive, frightened, or
maddened—even at those flèches themselves it was impossible to make out
what was taking place. there for several hours amid incessant cannon and
musketry fire, now russians were seen alone, now frenchmen alone, now
infantry, and now cavalry: they appeared, fired, fell, collided, not
knowing what to do with one another, screamed, and ran back again.

from the battlefield adjutants he had sent out, and orderlies from his
marshals, kept galloping up to napoleon with reports of the progress
of the action, but all these reports were false, both because it was
impossible in the heat of battle to say what was happening at any given
moment and because many of the adjutants did not go to the actual place
of conflict but reported what they had heard from others; and also
because while an adjutant was riding more than a mile to napoleon
circumstances changed and the news he brought was already becoming
false. thus an adjutant galloped up from murat with tidin

gs that
borodinó had been occupied and the bridge over the kolochá was in the
hands of the french. the adjutant asked whether napoleon wished the
troops to cross it? napoleon gave orders that the troops should form up
on the farther side and wait. but before that order was given—almost
as soon in fact as the adjutant had left borodinó—the bridge had been
retaken by the russians and burned, in the very skirmish at which pierre
had been present at the beginning of the battle.

an adjutant galloped up from the flèches with a pale and frightened face
and reported to napoleon that their attack had been repulsed, campan
wounded, and davout killed; yet at the very ti

me the adjutant had been
told that the french had been repulsed, the flèches had in fact been
recaptured by other french troops, and davout was alive and only
slightly bruised. on the basis of these necessarily untrustworthy
reports napoleon gave his orders, which had either been executed before
he gave them or could not be and were not executed.

the marshals and generals, who were nearer to the field of battle
but, like napoleon, did not take part in the actual fighting and only
occasionally went within musket range, made their own arrangements
without asking napoleon and issued orders where and in what direction to
fire and where cavalry should gallop and infantry should run. but even
their orders, like napoleon’s, were seldom carried out, and then but
partially. for the most part things happened contrary to their orders.
soldiers ordered to advance ran back on meeting grapeshot; soldiers

and as soon as they reached the top of the incline turned round and
galloped full speed back again. the infantry moved in the same way,
sometimes running to quite other places than those they were ordered to
go to. all orders as to where and when to move the guns, when to send
infantry to shoot or horsemen to ride down the russian infantry—all
such orders were given by the officers on the spot nearest to the
units concerned, without asking either ney, davout, or murat, much less
napoleon. they did not fear getting into trouble for not fulfilling
orders or for acting on their own initiative, for in battle what is at
stake is what is dearest to man—his own life—and it sometimes seems that
safety lies in running back, sometimes in running forward; and these men
who were right in the heat of the battle acted according to the mood
of the moment. in reality, however, all these movements forward and
backward did not improve or alter the position of the troops. all

the fields on which these men were floundering about. as soon as they
left the place where the balls and bullets were flying about, their
superiors, located in the background, re-formed them and brought them
under discipline and under the influence of that discipline led them
back to the zone of fire, where under the influence of fear of death
they lost their discipline and rushed about according to the chance
promptings of the throng.





chapter xxxiv

napoleon’s generals—davout, ney, and murat, who were near that region of
fire and sometimes even entered it—repeatedly led into it huge masses of
well-ordered troops. but contrary to what had always happened in their
former battles, instead of the news they expected of the enemy’s flight,
these orderly masses returned thence as disorganized and terrified mobs.
the generals re-formed them, but their numbers constantly decreased.
in the middle of the day murat sent his adjutant to napoleon to dema

nd
reinforcements.

napoleon sat at the foot of the knoll, drinking punch, when murat’s
adjutant galloped up with an assurance that the russians would be routed
if his majesty would let him have another division.

“reinforcements?” said napoleon in a tone of stern surprise, looking at
the adjutant—a handsome lad with long black curls arranged like murat’s
own—as though he did not understand his words.

“reinforcements!” thought napoleon to himself. “how can they need
reinforcements when they already have half the army directed against a
weak, unentrenched russian wing?”

“tell the king of naples,” said he sternly, “that it is not noon yet,
and i don’t yet see my chessboard clearly. go!...”

the handsome boy adjutant with the long hair sighed deeply without
removing his hand from his hat and galloped back to where men were being
slaughtered.

napoleon rose and having summoned caulaincourt and berthier began
talkin
 
 ___________________________
 
g to them about matters unconnected with the battle.

in the midst of this conversation, which was beginning to interest
napoleon, berthier’s eyes turned to look at a general with a suite, who
was galloping toward the knoll on a lathering horse. it was belliard.
having dismounted he went up to the emperor with rapid strides and in
a loud voice began boldly demonstrating the necessity of sending
reinforcements. he swore on his honor that the russians were lost if the
emperor would give another division.

napoleon shrugged his shoulders and continued to pace up and down
without replying. belliard began talking loudly and 
 
 ___________________________
 
eagerly to the
generals of the suite around him.

“you are very fiery, belliard,” said napoleon, when he again came up to
the general. “in the heat of a battle it is easy to make a mistake. go
and have another look and then come back to me.”

before belliard was out of sight, a messenger from another part of the
battlefield galloped up.

“now then, what do you want?” asked napoleon in the tone of a man
irritated at being continually disturbed.

“sire, the prince...” began the adjutant.

“asks for reinforcements?” said napoleon with an angry gesture.

the adjutant bent his head affirmatively and began to report, but the
emperor turned from him, took a couple of steps, stopped, came back, and
called berthier.

“we must give reserves,” he said, moving his arms slightly apart.
“who do you think should be sent there?” he asked of berthier (whom he
subsequently 
 
 ___________________________
 
termed “that gosling i have made an eagle”).

“send claparède’s division, sire,” replied berthier, who knew all the
division’s regiments, and battalions by heart.

napoleon nodded assent.

the adjutant galloped to claparède’s division and a few minutes later
the young guards stationed behind the knoll moved forward. napoleon
gazed silently in that direction.

“no!” he suddenly said to berthier. “i can’t send claparède. send
friant’s division.”

though there was no advantage in sending friant’s division instead of
claparède’s, and even an obvious inconvenience and delay in stopping
claparède and sending friant now, the order was carried out exactly.
napoleon did not notice that in regard to his army he was playing
the part of a doctor who hinders by his medicines—a role he so justly
understood a

nd condemned.

friant’s division disappeared as the others had done into the smoke
of the battlefield. from all sides adjutants continued to arrive at a
gallop and as if by agreement all said the same thing. they all asked
for reinforcements and all said that the russians were holding their
positions and maintaining a hellish fire under which the french army was
melting away.

napoleon sat on a campstool, wrapped in thought.

m. de beausset, the man so fond of travel, having fasted since morning,
came up to the emperor and ventured respectfully to suggest lunch to his
majesty.

“i hope i may now congratulate your majesty on a victory?” said he.

napoleon silently shook his head in negation. assuming the negation to
refer only to the victory and not to the lunch, m. de beausset ventured
with respectful jocularity to remark that there is no reason for not
having lunch when 
 
 ___________________________
 
one can get it.

“go away...” exclaimed napoleon suddenly and morosely, and turned aside.

a beatific smile of regret, repentance, and ecstasy beamed on m. de
beausset’s face and he glided away to the other generals.

napoleon was experiencing a feeling of depression like that of an
ever-lucky gambler who, after recklessly flinging money about and always
winning, suddenly just when he has calculated all the chances of the
game, finds that the more he considers his play the more surely he
loses.

his troops were the same, his generals the same, the same preparations
had been made, the same dispositions, and the same proclamation courte
et énergique, he himself was still the same: he knew that and knew that
he was now

hree orders and uttered a
few phrases, marshals and adjutants had come galloping up with
congratulations and happy faces, announcing the trophies taken, the
corps of prisoners, bundles of enemy eagles and standards, cannon and
stores, and murat had only begged leave to loose the cavalry to gather
in the baggage wagons. so it had been at lodi, marengo, arcola, jena,
austerlitz, wagram, and so on. but now something strange was happening
to his troops.

despite news of the capture of the flèches, napoleon saw that this was
not the same, not at all the same, as what had happened in his former
battles. he saw that what he was feeling was felt by all the men about
him experienced in the art of war. all their faces looked dejected, and
they all shunned one another’s eyes—only a de beausset could fail to
grasp the meaning of what was happening.

but napoleon with his long experience of war well knew the meaning of
a battle not gained by the attacking side in eight hours, after all
efforts had bee

 innumerable unlucky
chances presented themselves, and he expected them all. yes, it was like
a dream in which a man fancies that a ruffian is coming to attack him,
and raises his arm to strike that ruffian a terrible blow which he knows
should annihilate him, but then feels that his arm drops powerless and
limp like a rag, and the horror of unavoidable destruction seizes him in
his helplessness.

the news that the russians were attacking the left flank of the french
army aroused that horror in napoleon. he sat silently on a campstool
below the knoll, with head bowed and elbows on his knees. berthier
approached and suggested that they should ride along the line to
ascertain the position of affairs.

“what? what do you say?” asked napoleon. “yes, tell them to bring me my
horse.”

he mounted and rode toward semënovsk.

amid the powder smoke, slowly dispersing over the whole space through
which napoleon rode, horses and men were lying in pools of blood, singly
or in heaps. neither napole
 
 ___________________________
 
on nor any of his generals had ever before
seen such horrors or so many slain in such a small area. the roar of
guns, that had not ceased for ten hours, wearied the ear and gave
a peculiar significance to the spectacle, as music does to tableaux
vivants. napoleon rode up the high ground at semënovsk, and through the
smoke saw ranks of men in uniforms of a color unfamiliar to him. they
were russians.

the russians stood in serried ranks behind semënovsk village and its
knoll, and their guns boomed incessantly along their line and sent
forth clouds of smoke. it was no longer a battle: it was a continuous
slaughter which could be of no avail either to the french or the
russians. napoleon stopped his horse and again fell into the reverie
from which berthi

er had aroused him. he could not stop what was going on
before him and around him and was supposed to be directed by him and to
depend on him, and from its lack of success this affair, for the first
time, seemed to him unnecessary and horrible.

one of the generals rode up to napoleon and ventured to offer to lead
the old guard into action. ney and berthier, standing near napoleon,
exchanged looks and smiled contemptuously at this general’s senseless
offer.

napoleon bowed his head and remained silent a long time.

“at eight hundred leagues from france, i will not have my guard
destroyed!” he said, and turning his horse rode back to shevárdino.

on the rug-covered bench where pierre had seen him in the morning sat
kutúzov, his gray head hanging, his heavy body relaxed. he gave no
orders, but only assented to or dissented from what others suggested.

“yes, yes, do that,” he replied to various proposals. “yes, yes: go,

when scherbínin came galloping from the left flank with news that the
french had captured the flèches and the village of semënovsk, kutúzov,
guessing by the sounds of the battle and by scherbínin’s looks that the
news was bad, rose as if to stretch his legs and, taking scherbínin’s
arm, led him aside.

“go, my dear fellow,” he said to ermólov, “and see whether something
can’t be done.”

kutúzov was in górki, near the center of the russian position. the
attack directed by napoleon against our left flank had been several
times repulsed. in the center the french had not got beyond borodinó,
and on their left flank uvárov’s cavalry had put the french to flight.

toward three o’clock the french attacks ceased. on the faces of all
who came from the field of battle, and of those who stood around him,
kutúzov noticed an expression of extreme tension. he was satisfied with
the day’s success—a success exceeding his expectations, but the old
man’s strength was failing

chapter xxxviii

the terrible spectacle of the battlefield covered with dead and wounded,
together with the heaviness of his head and the news that some twenty
generals he knew personally had been killed or wounded, and the
consciousness of the impotence of his once mighty arm, produced an
unexpected impression on napoleon who usually liked to look at the
killed and wounded, thereby, he considered, testing his strength of
mind. this day the horrible appearance of the battlefield overcame
that strength of mind which he thought constituted his merit and his
greatness. he rode hurriedly from the battlefield and returned to the
shevárdino knoll, where he sat on his campstool, his sallow face
swollen and heavy, his eyes dim, his nose red, and his voice hoarse,
involuntarily listening, with downcast eyes, to the sound
 
 ___________________________
 

the heaviness of his head and chest reminded him of the possibility
of suffering and death for himself. at that moment he did not desire
moscow, or victory, or glory (what need had he for any more glory?). the
one thing he wished for was rest, tranquillity, and freedom. but when he
had been on the semënovsk heights the artillery commander had proposed
to him to bring several batteries of artillery up to those heights to
strengthen the fire on the russian troops crowded in front of knyazkóvo.
napoleon had assented and had given orders that news should be brought
to him of the effect those batteries produced.

an adjutant came now to inform him that the fire of two hundred guns
had been concentrated on the russians, as he had ordered, but that they
still held their ground.

“our fire is mowing them down by rows, but still they hold on,” said the
adjutant.

“they want more!...” said napoleon in a hoarse voice.

“sire?” asked the adjutant who had not heard the remark.

“they want

more!” croaked napoleon frowning. “let them have it!”

even before he gave that order the thing he did not desire, and for
which he gave the order only because he thought it was expected of him,
was being done. and he fell back into that artificial realm of imaginary
greatness, and again—as a horse walking a treadmill thinks it is doing
something for itself—he submissively fulfilled the cruel, sad, gloomy,
and inhuman role predestined for him.

reign would have begun.

paris would have been the capital of the world, and the french the envy
of the nations!

my leisure then, and my old age, would have been devoted, in company
with the empress and during the royal apprenticeship of my son, to
leisurely visiting, with our own horses and like a true country couple,
every corner of the empire, receiving complaints, redressing wrongs,
and scattering public buildings and benefactions on all sides and
everywhere.

napoleon, predestined by providence for the gloomy role of executioner
of the peoples, assured himself that the aim of his actions had been the
peoples’ welfare and that he could control the fate of millions and by
the employment of power confer benefactions.

“of four hundred thousand who crossed the vistula,” he wrote further
of the russian war, “half were austrians, prussians, saxons, poles,
bavarians, württembergers, mecklenburgers, spaniards, italians, and
neapolitans. the imperial army, s

 and they still did so at the end of the battle as at the
beginning. but even had the aim of the russians been to drive the french
from their positions, they could not have made this last effort, for all
the russian troops had been broken up, there was no part of the russian
army that had not suffered in the battle, and though still holding their
positions they had lost one half of their army.

the french, with the memory of all their former victories during
fifteen years, with the assurance of napoleon’s invincibility, with the
consciousness that they had captured part of the battlefield and had
lost only a quarter of their men and still had their guards intact,
twenty thousand strong, might easily have made that effort. the french
who had attacked the russian army in order to drive it from its position
ought to have made that effort, for as long as the russians continued to
block the road to moscow as before, the aim of the french had not been
attained and all their efforts and losses were

 in vain. but the french
did not make that effort. some historians say that napoleon need only
have used his old guards, who were intact, and the battle would have
been won. to speak of what would have happened had napoleon sent his
guards is like talking of what would happen if autumn became spring. it
could not be. napoleon did not give his guards, not because he did not
want to, but because it could not be done. all the generals, officers,
and soldiers of the french army knew it could not be done, because the
flagging spirit of the troops would not permit it.

it was not napoleon alone who had experienced that nightmare feeling
of the mighty arm being stricken powerless, but all the generals and
soldiers of his army whether they had taken part in the battle or not,

nó. the french invaders, like an infuriated animal
that has in its onslaught received a mortal wound, felt that they were
perishing, but could not stop, any more than the russian army, weaker
by one half, could help swerving. by impetus gained, the french army was
still able to roll forward to moscow, but there, without further effort
on the part of the russians, it had to perish, bleeding from the mortal
wound it had received at borodinó. the direct consequence of the battle
of borodinó was napoleon’s senseless flight from moscow, his retreat
along the old smolénsk road, the destruction of the invading army of
five hundred thousand men, and the downfall of napoleonic france, on
which at borodinó for the first time the hand of an opponent of stronger
spirit had been laid.

the historians, replying to this question, lay before us the sayings and
doings of a few dozen men in a building in the city of paris, calling
these sayings and doings “the revolution”; then they give a detailed
biography of napoleon and of certain people favorable or hostile to him;
tell of the influence some of these people had on others, and say: that

the forces of a dozen european nations burst into russia. the russian
army and people avoided a collision till smolénsk was reached, and again
from smolénsk to borodinó. the french army pushed on to moscow, its
goal, its impetus ever increasing as it neared its aim, just as the
velocity of a falling body increases as it approaches the earth. behind
it were seven hundred miles of hunger-stricken, hostile country; ahead
were a few dozen miles separating it from its goal. every soldier in
napoleon’s army felt this and the invasion moved on by its own momentum.

the more the russian army retreated the more fiercely a spirit of hatred
of the enemy flared up, and while it retreated the army increased and
consolidated. at borodinó a collision took place. neither army was
broken up, but the russian army retreated immediately after the
collision as inevitably as a ball recoils after colliding with another

brought the army as far as the sparrow hills without giving battle; if

given, to clear himself of the crime of abandoning moscow. but this
intrigue did not now occupy the old man’s mind. one terrible question
absorbed him and to that question he heard no reply from anyone. the
question for him now was: “have i really allowed napoleon to reach
moscow, and when did i do so? when was it decided? can it have been
yesterday when i ordered plátov to retreat, or was it the evening
before, when i had a nap and told bennigsen to issue orders? or was it
earlier still?... when, when was this terrible affair decided? moscow
must be abandoned. the army must retreat and the order to do so must
be given.” to give that terrible order seemed to him equivalent to
resigning the command of the army. and not only did he love power to

that he was destined to save russia and that that was why, against
the emperor’s wish and by the will of the people, he had been chosen
commander-in-chief. he was convinced that he alone could maintain
command of the army in these difficult circumstances, and that in all
the world he alone could encounter the invincible napoleon without fear,
and he was horrified at the thought of the order he had to issue. but
something had to be decided, and these conversations around him which

“it is disgraceful to run away from danger; only cowards are running
away from moscow,” they were told. in his broadsheets rostopchín
impressed on them that to leave moscow was shameful. they were ashamed
to be called cowards, ashamed to leave, but still they left, knowing
it had to be done. why did they go? it is impossible to suppose that
rostopchín had scared them by his accounts of horrors napoleon had
committed in conquered countries. the first people to go away were the
rich educated people who knew quite well that vienna and berlin had
remained intact and that during napoleon’s occupation the inhabitants
had spent their time pleasantly in the company of the charming frenchmen
whom the russians, and especially the russian ladies, then liked so
much.

if it could not succeed it would not do to take young ladies and house

they must go away, sorry as they were to abandon their property

significance of that immense and wealthy city being given over to
destruction, for a great city with wooden buildings was certain when
abandoned by its inhabitants to be burned. they went away each on his

the prince tried to comfort her, but hélène, as if quite distraught,
said through her tears that there was nothing to prevent her marrying,
that there were precedents (there were up to that time very few, but
she mentioned napoleon and some other exalted personages), that she had
never been her husband’s wife, and that she had been sacrificed.

em from behind, and an unreasoning hurry and alarm
overcame them. they all rushed forward to the bridge, onto it, and
to the fords and the boats. kutúzov himself had driven round by side
streets to the other side of moscow.

by ten o’clock in the morning of the second of september, only the rear
guard remained in the dorogomílov suburb, where they had ample room. the
main army was on the other side of moscow or beyond it.

at that very time, at ten in the morning of the second of september,
napoleon was standing among his troops on the poklónny hill looking at
the panorama spread out before him. from the twenty-sixth of august
to the second of september, that is from the battle of borodinó to the
entry of the french into moscow, during the whole of that agitating,
memorable week, there had been the extraordinary autumn weather that
always comes as a surprise, when the sun hangs low and gives more heat
than in spring, when everything shines so brightly in the rare clear
atmosphere that th

 golden stars startle and
delight us continually by falling from the sky.

at ten in the morning of the second of september this weather still
held.

the brightness of the morning was magical. moscow seen from the poklónny
hill lay spaciously spread out with her river, her gardens, and her
churches, and she seemed to be living her usual life, her cupolas
glittering like stars in the sunlight.

the view of the strange city with its peculiar architecture, such as
he had never seen before, filled napoleon with the rather envious and
uneasy curiosity men feel when they see an alien form of life that has
no knowledge of them. this city was evidently living with the full force
of its own life. by the indefinite signs which, even at a distance,
distinguish a living body from a dead one, napoleon from the poklónny
hill perceived the throb of life in the town and felt, as it were, the
breathing of that great and beautiful body.

mother city, must feel her feminine character, and napoleon felt it.

summoned lelorgne d’ideville, the interpreter.

scintillating and twinkling in the sunshine. but i shall spare her. on
the ancient monuments of barbarism and despotism i will inscribe great
words of justice and mercy.... it is just this which alexander will
feel most painfully, i know him.” (it seemed to napoleon that the chief
import of what was taking place lay in the personal struggle between
himself and alexander.) “from the height of the krémlin—yes, there
is the krémlin, yes—i will give them just laws; i will teach them the
meaning of true civilization, i will make generations of boyars remember

“qu’on m’amène les boyars,” * said he to his suite.

two hours passed. napoleon had lunched and was again standing in the
same place on the poklónny hill awaiting the deputation. his speech to
the boyars had already taken definite shape in his imagination. that
speech was full of dignity and greatness as napoleon understood it.

he was himself carried away by the tone of magnanimity he intended to
adopt toward moscow. in his imagination he appointed days for assemblies
at the palace of the tsars, at which russian notables and his own would

report of a signaling gun followed, and the troops, who were already
spread out on different sides of moscow, moved into the city through
tver, kalúga, and dorogomílov gates. faster and faster, vying with
one another, they moved at the double or at a trot, vanishing amid the
clouds of dust they raised and making the air ring with a deafening roar
of mingling shouts.

drawn on by the movement of his troops napoleon rode with them as far as
the dorogomílov gate, but there again stopped and, dismounting from his
horse, paced for a long time by the kámmer-kollézski rampart, awaiting
the deputation.

meanwhile moscow was empty. there were still people in it, perhaps a
fiftieth part of its former inhabitants had remained, but it was empty.
it was empty in the sense that a dying queenless hive is empty.

, and sleepy shells of
bees. they have almost all died unawares, sitting in the sanctuary they
had guarded and which is now no more. they reek of decay and death. only
a few of them still move, rise, and feebly fly to settle on the enemy’s
hand, lacking the spirit to die stinging him; the rest are dead and fall
as lightly as fish scales. the beekeeper closes the hive, chalks a mark
on it, and when he has time tears out its contents and burns it clean.

so in the same way moscow was empty when napoleon, weary, uneasy, and
morose, paced up and down in front of the kámmer-kollézski rampart,
awaiting what to his mind was a necessary, if but formal, observance of
the proprieties—a deputation.

in various corners of moscow there still remained a few people aimlessly
moving about, following their old habits and hardly aware of what they
were doing.

when with due circumspection napoleon was informed that moscow was
empty, he looked angrily at his informant, turned away, and silently
continued t

e a good thing,
even if moscow were taken, for him to remain there and do what he was
predestined to do.

next day, with the sole idea of not sparing himself and not lagging in
any way behind them, pierre went to the three hills gate. but when he
returned to the house convinced that moscow would not be defended, he
suddenly felt that what before had seemed to him merely a possibility
had now become absolutely necessary and inevitable. he must remain in
moscow, concealing his name, and must meet napoleon and kill him, and
either perish or put an end to the misery of all europe—which it seemed
to him was solely due to napoleon.

pierre knew all the details of the attempt on bonaparte’s life in 1809
by a german student in vienna, and knew that the student had been shot.
and the risk to which he would expose his life by carrying out his
design excited him still more.

two equally strong feelings drew pierre irresistibly to this purpose.
the first was a feeling of the necessity of sacrifice and

two almost sleepless nights passed on a short sofa without bedding—all
this kept him in a state of excitement bordering on insanity.

it was two o’clock in the afternoon. the french had already entered
moscow. pierre knew this, but instead of acting he only thought about
his undertaking, going over its minutest details in his mind. in his
fancy he did not clearly picture to himself either the striking of the
blow or the death of napoleon, but with extraordinary vividness and
melancholy enjoyment imagined his own destruction and heroic endurance.

“yes, alone, for the sake of all, i must do it or perish!” he thought.
“yes, i will approach... and then suddenly... with pistol or dagger?
but that is all the same! ‘it is not i but the hand of providence that
punishes thee,’ i shall say,” thought he, imagining what he would say
when killing napoleon. “well then, take me and execute me!” he went on,

w had been taken or that the happy
conquerors were masters in it and were patronizing him. painful as
that was it was not that which tormented pierre at the moment. he was
tormented by the consciousness of his own weakness. the few glasses of
wine he had drunk and the conversation with this good-natured man had
destroyed the mood of concentrated gloom in which he had spent the last
few days and which was essential for the execution of his design. the
pistol, dagger, and peasant coat were ready. napoleon was to enter the
town next day. pierre still considered that it would be a useful and
worthy action to slay the evildoer, but now he felt that he would not
do it. he did not know why, but he felt a foreboding that he would not
carry out his intention. he struggled against the confession of his
weakness but dimly felt that he could not overcome it and that his
former gloomy frame of mind, concerning vengeance, killing, and
self-sacrifice, had been dispersed like dust by contact with the first

the first time that he certainly could
not carry the weapon in his hand through the streets. it was difficult
to hide such a big pistol even under his wide coat. he could not
carry it unnoticed in his belt or under his arm. besides, it had been
discharged, and he had not had time to reload it. “no matter, dagger
will do,” he said to himself, though when planning his design he had
more than once come to the conclusion that the chief mistake made by the
student in 1809 had been to try to kill napoleon with a dagger. but as
his chief aim consisted not in carrying out his design, but in proving
to himself that he would not abandon his intention and was doing all he
could to achieve it, pierre hastily took the blunt jagged dagger in a
green sheath which he had bought at the súkharev market with the pistol,
and hid it under his waistcoat.

having tied a girdle over his coat and pulled his cap low on his head,
pierre went down the corridor, trying to avoid making a noise or meeting
the captain,

 it did pierre understand that he had to pass on the other side
of the street. he heard nothing and saw nothing of what went on around
him. he carried his resolution within himself in terror and haste, like
something dreadful and alien to him, for, after the previous night’s
experience, he was afraid of losing it. but he was not destined to bring
his mood safely to his destination. and even had he not been hindered by
anything on the way, his intention could not now have been carried out,
for napoleon had passed the arbát more than four hours previously on his
way from the dorogomílov suburb to the krémlin, and was now sitting in
a very gloomy frame of mind in a royal study in the krémlin, giving
detailed and exact orders as to measures to be taken immediately
to extinguish the fire, to prevent looting, and to reassure the
inhabitants. but pierre did not know this; he was entirely absorbed
in what lay before him, and was tortured—as those are who obstinately

was writing in haste from the field of battle before collecting full
information. it followed that there must have been a victory. and at
once, without leaving the church, thanks were rendered to the creator
for his help and for the victory.

anna pávlovna’s presentiment was justified, and all that morning a
joyously festive mood reigned in the city. everyone believed the victory
to have been complete, and some even spoke of napoleon’s having been
captured, of his deposition, and of the choice of a new ruler for
france.

it is very difficult for events to be reflected in their real strength
and completeness amid the conditions of court life and far from the
scene of action. general events involuntarily group themselves around
some particular incident. so now the courtiers’ pleasure was based as
much on the fact that the news had arrived on the emperor’s birthday as
on the fact of the victory itself. it was like a succ

the petersburg world this sad side of the affair again involuntarily
centered round a single incident: kutáysov’s death. everybody knew
him, the emperor liked him, and he was young and interesting. that day
everyone met with the words:

“what a wonderful coincidence! just during the service. but what a loss
kutáysov is! how sorry i am!”

“what did i tell about kutúzov?” prince vasíli now said with a
prophet’s pride. “i always said he was the only man capable of defeating
napoleon.”

but next day no news arrived from the army and the public mood grew
anxious. the courtiers suffered because of the suffering the suspense
occasioned the emperor.

“fancy the emperor’s position!” said they, and instead of extolling
kutúzov as they had done the day before, they condemned him as the cause
of the emperor’s anxiety. that day prince vasíli no longer boasted of
his protege kutúzov, but remained silent when the commander-in-chief was
mentioned. moreover, toward evening,

turned away as if to hide from michaud the tears that rose to his eyes,
and went to the further end of his study. having stood there a few
moments, he strode back to michaud and pressed his arm below the elbow
with a vigorous movement. the emperor’s mild and handsome face was
flushed and his eyes gleamed with resolution and anger.

“colonel michaud, do not forget what i say to you here, perhaps we may
recall it with pleasure someday... napoleon or i,” said the emperor,
touching his breast. “we can no longer both reign together. i have
learned to know him, and he will not deceive me any more....”

and the emperor paused, with a frown.

when he heard these words and saw the expression of firm resolution in
the emperor’s eyes, michaud—quoique étranger, russe de cœur et d’âme,—at
that solemn moment felt himself enraptured by all that he had heard (as
he used afterwards to say), and gave expression to his own feelings and

provincial life in 1812 went on very much as usual, but with this
difference, that it was livelier in the towns in consequence of the
arrival of many wealthy families from moscow, and as in everything that
went on in russia at that time a special recklessness was noticeable, an

from prince shcherbátov’s house the prisoners were led straight down the
virgin’s field, to the left of the nunnery, as far as a kitchen garden
in which a post had been set up. beyond that post a fresh pit had been
dug in the ground, and near the post and the pit a large crowd stood
in a semicircle. the crowd consisted of a few russians and many
of napoleon’s soldiers who were not on duty—germans, italians, and
frenchmen, in a variety of uniforms. to the right and left of the post
stood rows of french troops in blue uniforms with red epaulets and high
boots and shakos.

the prisoners were placed in a certain order, according to the list
(pierre was sixth), and were led to the post. several drums suddenly

be convinced that the will of the historic hero does not control the
actions of the mass but is itself continually controlled. it may seem
to be a matter of indifference whether we understand the meaning of
historical events this way or that; yet there is the same difference
between a man who says that the people of the west moved on the east
because napoleon wished it and a man who says that this happened because
it had to happen, as there is between those who declared that the

so-called flank march across the krásnaya pakhrá river. they ascribe the
glory of that achievement of genius to different men and dispute as to
whom the honor is due. even foreign historians, including the french,
acknowledge the genius of the russian commanders when they speak of
that flank march. but it is hard to understand why military writers,
and following them others, consider this flank march to be the profound
conception of some one man who saved russia and destroyed napoleon. in
the first place it is hard to understand where the profundity and genius
of this movement lay, for not much mental effort was needed to see that
the best position for an army when it is not being attacked is where
there are most provisions; and even a dull boy of thirteen could have
guessed that the best position for an army after its retreat from moscow
in 1812 was on the kalúga road. so it is impossible to understand by
what reasoning the historians reach the conclusion that this maneuve

all follow that the march was the cause of it.

that flank march might not only have failed to give any advantage to
the russian army, but might in other circumstances have led to its
destruction. what would have happened had moscow not burned down? if
murat had not lost sight of the russians? if napoleon had not remained
inactive? if the russian army at krásnaya pakhrá had given battle as
bennigsen and barclay advised? what would have happened had the french
attacked the russians while they were marching beyond the pakhrá? what
would have happened if on approaching tarútino, napoleon had attacked
the russians with but a tenth of the energy he had shown when he
attacked them at smolénsk? what would have happened had the french moved
on petersburg?... in any of these eventualities the flank

restrain the russian army from useless engagements.

the beast wounded at borodinó was lying where the fleeing hunter had
left him; but whether he was still alive, whether he was strong and
merely lying low, the hunter did not know. suddenly the beast was heard
to moan.

the moan of that wounded beast (the french army) which betrayed its
calamitous condition was the sending of lauriston to kutúzov’s camp with
overtures for peace.

napoleon, with his usual assurance that whatever entered his head was
right, wrote to kutúzov the first words that occurred to him, though
they were meaningless.

monsieur le prince koutouzov: i am sending one of my adjutants-general
to discuss several interesting questions with you. i beg your highness
to credit what he says to you, especially when he expresses the
sentiment of esteem and special regard i have long entertained for your
person. this letter having no other object, i pray god, monsieur l

kutúzov replied: “i should be cursed by posterity were i looked on as
the initiator of a settlement of any sort. such is the present spirit
of my nation.” but he continued to exert all his powers to restrain his
troops from attacking.

during the month that the french troops were pillaging in moscow and
the russian troops were quietly encamped at tarútino, a change had taken
place in the relative strength of the two armies—both in spirit and in
number—as a r

thousand men is moving on the petersburg road. another corps of several
thousand men is moving on dmítrov. a third has advanced along the

between ruza and mozháysk. napoleon himself was in moscow as late as
the twenty-fifth. in view of all this information, when the enemy has
scattered his forces in large detachments, and with napoleon and his
guards in moscow, is it possible that the enemy’s forces confronting you
are so considerable as not to allow of your taking the offensive? on the
contrary, he is probably pursuing you with detachments, or at most with
an army corps much weaker than the army entrusted to you. it would seem

of tarútino, just
because of its incongruities, was exactly what was wanted at that stage
of the campaign. it would be difficult and even impossible to imagine
any result more opportune than the actual outcome of this battle. with
a minimum of effort and insignificant losses, despite the greatest
confusion, the most important results of the whole campaign were
attained: the transition from retreat to advance, an exposure of the
weakness of the french, and the administration of that shock which
napoleon’s army had only awaited to begin its flight.





chapter viii

napoleon enters moscow after the brilliant victory de la moskowa; there
can be no doubt about the victory for the battlefield remains in the
hands of the french. the russians retreat and abandon their ancient
capital. moscow, abounding in provisions, arms, munitions, and
incalculable wealth, is in napoleon’s hands. the russian army, only half
the strength of the french, does not make a single attempt to attack for
a whole month
 
 ___________________________
 
. napoleon’s position is most brilliant. he can either fall
on the russian army with double its strength and destroy it; negotiate
an advantageous peace, or in case of a refusal make a menacing move on
petersburg, or even, in the case of a reverse, return to smolénsk or
vílna; or remain in moscow; in short, no special genius would seem to be
required to retain the brilliant position the french held at that time.
for that, only very simple and easy steps were necessary: not to allow
the troops to loot,

 to prepare winter clothing—of which there was
sufficient in moscow for the whole army—and methodically to collect the
provisions, of which (according to the french historians) there were
enough in moscow to supply the whole army for six months. yet napoleon,
that greatest of all geniuses, who the historians declare had control of
the army, took none of these steps.

he not merely did nothing of the kind, but on the contrary he used his
power to select the most foolish and ruinous of all the courses open
to him. of all that napoleon might have done: wintering in moscow,
advancing on petersburg or on nízhni-nóvgorod, or retiring by a more
northerly or more southerly route (say by the road kutúzov afterwards
took), nothing more stupid or disastrou

mained in moscow till october, letting the troops
plunder the city; then, hesitating whether to leave a garrison behind
him, he quitted moscow, approached kutúzov without joining battle,
turned to the right and reached málo-yaroslávets, again without
attempting to break through and take the road kutúzov took, but retiring
instead to mozháysk along the devastated smolénsk road. nothing more
stupid than that could have been devised, or more disastrous for the
army, as the sequel showed. had napoleon’s aim been to destroy his army,
the most skillful strategist could hardly have devised any series
of actions that would so completely have accomplished that purpose,
independently of anything the russian army might do.

napoleon, the man of genius, did this! but to say that he destroyed his
army because he wished to, or because he was very stupid, would be as
unjust as to say that he had brought his troops to moscow because he
wished to and because he was very clever and a genius.

in both ca

ses his personal activity, having no more force than the
personal activity of any soldier, merely coincided with the laws that
guided the event.

the historians quite falsely represent napoleon’s faculties as having
weakened in moscow, and do so only because the results did not justify
his actions. he employed all his ability and strength to do the best he
could for himself and his army, as he had done previously and as he did
subsequently in 1813. his activity at that time was no less astounding
than it was in egypt, in italy, in austria, and in prussia. we do not
know for certain in how far his genius was genuine in egypt—where forty
centuries looked down upon his grandeur—for

r and plan after plan were issued by him
from the time he entered moscow till the time he left it. the absence
of citizens and of a deputation, and even the burning of moscow, did not
disconcert him. he did not lose sight either of the welfare of his
army or of the doings of the enemy, or of the welfare of the people
of russia, or of the direction of affairs in paris, or of diplomatic
considerations concerning the terms of the anticipated peace.





chapter ix

with regard to military matters, napoleon immediately on his entry into
moscow gave general sabastiani strict orders to observe the movements
of the russian army, sent army corps out along the different roads, and
charged murat to find kutúzov. then he gave careful directions about the
fortification of the krémlin, and drew up a brilliant plan for a future
campaign over the whole map of russia.

with regard to diplomatic questions, napoleon summoned captain yákovlev,
who had been robbed and was in rags and did not know how to get ou

and finally that you should not doubt
that these will be safeguarded, since such is the will of the greatest
and most just of monarchs. soldiers and citizens, of whatever nation you
may be, re-establish public confidence, the source of the welfare of
a state, live like brothers, render mutual aid and protection one to
another, unite to defeat the intentions of the evil-minded, obey the
military and civil authorities, and your tears will soon cease to flow!

with regard to supplies for the army, napoleon decreed that all the
troops in turn should enter moscow à la maraude * to obtain provisions
for themselves, so that the army might have its future provided for.

* as looters.

with regard to religion, napoleon ordered the priests to be brought back
and services to be again performed in the churches.

with regard to commerce and to provisioning the army, the following was
placarded everywhere:

proclamation!

misfortune has driven

to
co-operate with him for the public welfare! lay your respect and
confidence at his feet and do not delay to unite with us!

with the object of raising the spirits of the troops and of the people,
reviews were constantly held and rewards distributed. the emperor
rode through the streets to comfort the inhabitants, and, despite his
preoccupation with state affairs, himself visited the theaters that were
established by his order.

in regard to philanthropy, the greatest virtue of crowned heads,
napoleon also did all in his power. he caused the words maison de ma
mère to be inscribed on the charitable institutions, thereby combining
tender filial affection with the majestic benevolence of a monarch. he
visited the foundling hospital and, allowing the orphans saved by him
to kiss his white hands, graciously conversed with tutólmin. then, as
thiers eloquently recounts, he ordered his soldiers to be paid in forged
russian money which he had prepared: “raising the use of these means

orthy of himself and of the french army, he let relief
be distributed to those who had been burned out. but as food was too
precious to be given to foreigners, who were for the most part enemies,
napoleon preferred to supply them with money with which to purchase food
from outside, and had paper rubles distributed to them.”

with reference to army discipline, orders were continually being issued
to inflict severe punishment for the nonperformance of military duties
and to suppress robbery.

but strange to say, all these measures, efforts, and plans—which were
not at all worse than others issued in similar circumstances—did not
affect the essence of the matter but, like the h
 
 ___________________________
 
with reference to the military side—the plan of campaign—that work of
genius of which thiers remarks that, “his genius never devised anything
more profound, more skillful, or more admirable,” and enters into a
polemic with m. fain to prove that this work of genius must be referred
not to the fourth but to the fifteenth of october—that plan never was or
could be executed, for it was quite out of touch with the facts of the
case. the fortifying of the krémlin, for which la mosquée (as napoleon
termed the church of basil the beatified) was to have been razed to
the ground, proved quite useless. the mining of the krémlin only helped
toward fulfilling napoleon’s wish that it should be blown up when he
left moscow—as a child wants the floor on which he has hurt himself to
be beaten. the pursuit of the russian army, about which napoleon was so
concerned, produced an unheard-of result. the french generals lost touch
with the russian army of sixty thousand men, and according to thiers 
 
 ___________________________
 
it
was only eventually found, like a lost pin, by the skill—and apparently
the genius—of murat.

with reference to diplomacy, all napoleon’s arguments as to his
magnanimity and justice, both to tutólmin and to yákovlev (whose chief
concern was to obtain a greatcoat and a conveyance), proved useless;
alexander did not receive these envoys and did not reply to their
embassage.

with regard to legal matters, after the execution of the supposed
incendiaries the rest of moscow burned down.

with regard to administrative matters, the establishment of a
municipality did not stop the robberies and was only of use to certain
people who
 
 ___________________________
 
 formed part of that municipality and under pretext of
preserving order looted moscow or saved their own property from being
looted.

with regard to religion, as to which in egypt matters had so easily been
settled by napoleon’s visit to a mosque, no results were achieved.
two or three priests who were found in moscow did try to carry out
napoleon’s wish, but one of them was slapped in the face by a french
soldier while conducting service, and a french official reported of
another that: “the priest whom i found and invited to say mass cleaned
and locked up the church. that night the doors were again broken
open, the padlocks smashed, the books mutilated, and other disorders
perpetrated.”

with reference to commerce, the proclamation to industrious workmen and
to peasants evoked no response. there were no industrious workmen, and
th

tion and killed them.

as to the theaters for the entertainment of the people and the troops,
these did not meet with success either. the theaters set up in the
krémlin and in posnyákov’s house were closed again at once because the
actors and actresses were robbed.

even philanthropy did not have the desired effect. the genuine as
well as the false paper money which flooded moscow lost its value. the
french, collecting booty, cared only for gold. not only was the
paper money valueless which napoleon so graciously distributed to the
unfortunate, but even silver lost its value in relation to gold.

but the most amazing example of the ineffectiveness of the orders given
by the authorities at that time was napoleon’s attempt to stop the
looting and re-establish discipline.

this is what the army authorities were reporting:

“looting continues in the city despite the decrees against it. order
is not yet restored and not a single merchant is carrying on trade in a
lawful manner. the sutlers

tyards and even under the very windows
of the emperor.”

that army, like a herd of cattle run wild and trampling underfoot the
provender which might have saved it from starvation, disintegrated and
perished with each additional day it remained in moscow. but it did not
go away.

it began to run away only when suddenly seized by a panic caused by the
capture of transport trains on the smolénsk road, and by the battle of
tarútino. the news of that battle of tarútino, unexpectedly received
by napoleon at a review, evoked in him a desire to punish the russians
(thiers says), and he issued the order for departure which the whole
army was demanding.

fleeing from moscow the soldiers took with them everything they had
stolen. napoleon, too, carried away his own personal trésor, but on
seeing the baggage trains that impeded the army, he was (thiers says)
horror-struck. and yet with his experience of war he did not order all
the superfluous vehicles to be burned, as he had done with those of a
ce

rtain marshal when approaching moscow. he gazed at the calèches and
carriages in which soldiers were riding and remarked that it was a very
good thing, as those vehicles could be used to carry provisions, the
sick, and the wounded.

the plight of the whole army resembled that of a wounded animal which
feels it is perishing and does not know what it is doing. to study the
skillful tactics and aims of napoleon and his army from the time it
entered moscow till it was destroyed is like studying the dying leaps
and shudders of a mortally wounded animal. very often a wounded animal,
hearing a rustle, rushes straight at the hunter’s gun, runs forward and
back again, and hastens its own end. napoleon, under pressure from his
whole army, did the same thing. the rustle of the battle of tarútino
frightened the beast, and it rushed forward onto the hunter’s gun,
reached him, turned back, and finally—lik

e any wild beast—ran back along
the most disadvantageous and dangerous path, where the old scent was
familiar.

during the whole of that period napoleon, who seems to us to have been
the leader of all these movements—as the figurehead of a ship may seem
to a savage to guide the vessel—acted like a child who, holding a couple
of strings inside a carriage, thinks he is driving it.

these quests and experiments had failed him. and now without thinking
about it he had found that peace and inner harmony only through the
horror of death, through privation, and through what he recognized in

those dreadful moments he had lived through at the executions had as it
were forever washed away from his imagination and memory the agitating
thoughts and feelings that had formerly seemed so important. it did
not now occur to him to think of russia, or the war, or politics, or
napoleon. it was plain to him that all these things were no business
of his, and that he was not called on to judge concerning them and
therefore could not do so. “russia and summer weather are not bound
together,” he thought, repeating words of karatáev’s which he found
strangely consoling. his intention of killing napoleon and his
calculations of the cabalistic number of the beast of the apocalypse now
seemed to him meaningless and even ridiculous. his anger with his wife

sleep beside his companions.





chapter xv

in the early days of october another envoy came to kutúzov with a letter
from napoleon proposing peace and falsely dated from moscow, though
napoleon was already not far from kutúzov on the old kalúga road.
kutúzov replied to this letter as he had done to the one formerly
brought by lauriston, saying that there could be no question of peace.

soon after that a report was received from dórokhov’s guerrilla
detachment operating to the left of tarútino that troops of broussier’s
division had been seen at formínsk and that being separated from the
rest of the french army th

 and so on, and who was thought to be and was spoken of as
undecided and undiscerning—but whom we find commanding wherever the
position was most difficult all through the russo-french wars from
austerlitz to the year 1813. at austerlitz he remained last at the
augezd dam, rallying the regiments, saving what was possible when all
were flying and perishing and not a single general was left in the rear
guard. ill with fever he went to smolénsk with twenty thousand men
to defend the town against napoleon’s whole army. in smolénsk, at the
malákhov gate, he had hardly dozed off in a paroxysm of fever before he
was awakened by the bombardment of the town—and smolénsk held out all
day long. at the battle of borodinó, when bagratión was killed and nine
tenths of the men of our left flank had fallen and the full force of the
french artillery fire was directed against it, the man sent there was
this same irresolute and undiscerning dokhtúrov—kutúzov hastening to
rectify a mistake he had m

kalúga road and began to enter formínsk, where only broussier had
been till then. at that time dokhtúrov had under his command, besides
dórokhov’s detachment, the two small guerrilla detachments of figner and
seslávin.

on the evening of october 11 seslávin came to the aristóvo headquarters
with a french guardsman he had captured. the prisoner said that the
troops that had entered formínsk that day were the vanguard of the whole
army, that napoleon was there and the whole army had left moscow four
days previously. that same evening a house serf who had come from
bórovsk said he had seen an immense army entering the town. some
cossacks of dokhtúrov’s detachment reported having sighted the french
guards marching along the road to bórovsk. from all these reports it was
evident that where they had expected to meet a single division there
was now the whole french army marching from moscow in an unexpected
direction—along the kalúga roa

wake the captain first.”

“but this is very important, from general dokhtúrov,” said
bolkhovítinov, entering the open door which he had found by feeling in
the dark.

the orderly had gone in before him and began waking somebody.

“your honor, your honor! a courier.”

“what? what’s that? from whom?” came a sleepy voice.

“from dokhtúrov and from alexéy petróvich. napoleon is at formínsk,”
said bolkhovítinov, unable to see in the dark who was speaking but
guessing by the voice that it was not konovnítsyn.

the man who had wakened yawned and stretched himself.

“i don’t like waking him,” he said, fumbling for something. “he is very
ill. perhaps this is only a rumor.”

“here is the dispatch,” said bolkhovítinov. “my orders are to give it at
once to the general on duty.”

“wait a moment, i’ll light a candle. you damned rascal, where do yo

ed; he had waited a whole month for them and grew
more impatient the longer he waited. lying on his bed during those
sleepless nights he did just what he reproached those younger generals
for doing. he imagined all sorts of possible contingencies, just like
the younger men, but with this difference, that he saw thousands of
contingencies instead of two or three and based nothing on them. the
longer he thought the more contingencies presented themselves. he
imagined all sorts of movements of the napoleonic army as a whole or
in sections—against petersburg, or against him, or to outflank him.
he thought too of the possibility (which he feared most of all) that
napoleon might fight him with his own weapon and remain in moscow
awaiting him. kutúzov even imagined that napoleon’s army might turn back
through medýn and yukhnóv, but the one thing he could not foresee was
what happened—the insane, convulsive stampede of napoleon’s army during
its first eleven days after leaving moscow: a sta
 
 ___________________________
 
mpede which made
possible what kutúzov had not yet even dared to think of—the complete
extermination of the french. dórokhov’s report about broussier’s
division, the guerrillas’ reports of distress in napoleon’s army, rumors
of preparations for leaving moscow, all confirmed the supposition that
the french army was beaten and preparing for flight. but these were
only suppositions, which seemed important to the younger men but not to
kutúzov. with his sixty years’ experience he knew what value to attach
to rumors, knew how apt people who desire anything are to group all news
so that it appears to confirm what they desire, and he knew how readily
in such cases they omit all that makes for the contr

n, call him here.”

kutúzov sat up with one leg hanging down from the bed and his big paunch
resting against the other which was doubled under him. he screwed up his
seeing eye to scrutinize the messenger more carefully, as if wishing to
read in his face what preoccupied his own mind.

“tell me, tell me, friend,” said he to bolkhovítinov in his low, aged
voice, as he pulled together the shirt which gaped open on his chest,
“come nearer—nearer. what news have you brought me? eh? that napoleon
has left moscow? are you sure? eh?”

bolkhovítinov gave a detailed account from the beginning of all he had
been told to report.

“speak quicker, quicker! don’t torture me!” kutúzov interrupted him.

bolkhovítinov told him everything and was then silent, awaiting
instructions. toll was beginning to say something but kutúzov checked
him. he tried to say something, but his face suddenly puckered and
wrinkled; he waved his arm at toll and turned to the opposite side of
the room, to the

nd of the campaign all
kutúzov’s activity was directed toward restraining his troops, by
authority, by guile, and by entreaty, from useless attacks,
maneuvers, or encounters with the perishing enemy. dokhtúrov went to
málo-yaroslávets, but kutúzov lingered with the main army and gave
orders for the evacuation of kalúga—a retreat beyond which town seemed
to him quite possible.

everywhere kutúzov retreated, but the enemy without waiting for his
retreat fled in the opposite direction.

napoleon’s historians describe to us his skilled maneuvers at tarútino
and málo-yaroslávets, and make conjectures as to what would have
happened had napoleon been in time to penetrate into the rich southern
provinces.

but not to speak of the fact that nothing prevented him from advancing
into those southern provinces (for the russian army did not bar his
way), the historians forget that nothing could have saved his army, for
then already it bore within itself the germs of inevitable ruin. how

 keeping them, and on arriving at
smolénsk had looted provisions instead of storing them—how could that
army recuperate in kalúga province, which was inhabited by russians such
as those who lived in moscow, and where fire had the same property of
consuming what was set ablaze?

that army could not recover anywhere. since the battle of borodinó
and the pillage of moscow it had borne within itself, as it were, the
chemical elements of dissolution.

the members of what had once been an army—napoleon himself and all his
soldiers fled—without knowing whither, each concerned only to make his
escape as quickly as possible from this position, of the hopelessness of
which they were all more or less vaguely conscious.

so it came about that at the council at málo-yaroslávets, when the
generals pretending to confer together expressed various opinions, all
mouths were closed by the opinion uttered by the simple-minded soldier
mouton who, speaking last, said what they all felt: that the one thin

needful was to get away as quickly as possible; and no one, not
even napoleon, could say anything against that truth which they all
recognized.

but though they all realized that it was necessary to get away, there
still remained a feeling of shame at admitting that they must flee. an
external shock was needed to overcome that shame, and this shock came in
due time. it was what the french called “le hourra de l’empereur.”

the day after the council at málo-yaroslávets napoleon rode out early in
the morning amid the lines of his army with his suite of marshals and
an escort, on the pretext of inspecting the army and the scene of the
previous and of the impending battle. some cossacks on the prowl for
booty fell in with the emperor and very nearly captured him. if the
cossacks did not capture napoleon then, what saved him was the very
thing that was destroying the french army, the booty on which the
cossacks fell. here as at tarútino they went after plunder, leaving t

he
men. disregarding napoleon they rushed after the plunder and napoleon
managed to escape.

when les enfants du don might so easily have taken the emperor himself
in the midst of his army, it was clear that there was nothing for it but
to fly as fast as possible along the nearest, familiar road. napoleon
with his forty-year-old stomach understood that hint, not feeling his
former agility and boldness, and under the influence of the fright
the cossacks had given him he at once agreed with mouton and issued
orders—as the historians tell us—to retreat by the smolénsk road.

that napoleon agreed with mouton, and that the army retreated, does
not prove that napoleon caused it to retreat, but that the forces which
influenced the whole army and directed it along the mozháysk (that is,
the smolé

l his hopes and desires. and
the impulses felt by a single person are always magnified in a crowd.

for the french retreating along the old smolénsk road, the final
goal—their native land—was too remote, and their immediate goal
was smolénsk, toward which all their desires and hopes, enormously
intensified in the mass, urged them on. it was not that they knew that
much food and fresh troops awaited them in smolénsk, nor that they were
told so (on the contrary their superior officers, and napoleon himself,
knew that provisions were scarce there), but because this alone could
give them strength to move on and endure their present privations. so
both those who knew and those who did not know deceived themselves, and
pushed on to smolénsk as to a promised land.

coming out onto the highroad the french fled with surprising energy
and unheard-of rapidity toward the goal they had fixed on. besides the
common impulse which bound the whole crowd of french into one mass and
supplied them with a

f an army—a hundredth part of a nation—should oblige
that whole nation to submit. an army gains a victory, and at once the
rights of the conquering nation have increased to the detriment of the
defeated. an army has suffered defeat, and at once a people loses its
rights in proportion to the severity of the reverse, and if its army
suffers a complete defeat the nation is quite subjugated.

so according to history it has been found from the most ancient times,
and so it is to our own day. all napoleon’s wars serve to confirm this
rule. in proportion to the defeat of the austrian army austria loses
its rights, and the rights and the strength of france increase. the
victories of the french at jena and auerstädt destroy the independent
existence of prussia.

but then, in 1812, the french gain a victory near moscow. moscow is
taken and after that, with no further battles, it is not russia that
ceases to exist, but the french army of six hundred thousand, and
then napoleonic france itself. to

history: to say that the field of battle at borodinó remained in the
hands of the russians, or that after moscow there were other battles
that destroyed napoleon’s army, is impossible.

after the french victory at borodinó there was no general engagement nor
any that were at all serious, yet the french army ceased to exist. what
does this mean? if it were an example taken from the history of china,
we might say that it was not an historic phenomenon (which is the
historians’ usual expedient when anything does not fit their standards);
if the matter concerned some brief conflict in which only a small number
of troops took part, we might treat it as

after the burning of smolénsk a war began which did not follow any
previous traditions of war. the burning of towns and villages, the
retreats after battles, the blow dealt at borodinó and the renewed
retreat, the burning of moscow, the capture of marauders, the seizure of
transports, and the guerrilla war were all departures from the rules.

napoleon felt this, and from the time he took up the correct fencing
attitude in moscow and instead of his opponent’s rapier saw a cudgel
raised above his head, he did not cease to complain to kutúzov and to
the emperor alexander that the war was being carried on contrary to all
the rules—as if there were any rules for killing people. in spite of the
complaints of the french as to the nonobservance of the rules, in
spite of the fact that to some highly placed russians it seemed rather

after staggering into smolénsk which seemed to them a promised land, the
french, searching for food, killed one another, sacked their own stores,
and when everything had been plundered fled farther.

they all went without knowing whither or why they were going. still less
did that genius, napoleon, know it, for no one issued any orders to
him. but still he and those about him retained their old habits: wrote
commands, letters, reports, and orders of the day; called one another
sire, mon cousin, prince d’eckmühl, roi de naples, and so on. but these
orders and reports were only on paper, nothing in them was acted upon
for they could not be carried out, and though they entitled one
another majesties, highnesses, or cousins, they all felt that they were

sian and french armies during the campaign
from moscow back to the niemen were like those in a game of russian
blindman’s bluff, in which two players are blindfolded and one of
them occasionally rings a little bell to inform the catcher of his
whereabouts. first he rings his bell fearlessly, but when he gets into
a tight place he runs away as quietly as he can, and often thinking to
escape runs straight into his opponent’s arms.

at first while they were still moving along the kalúga road, napoleon’s
armies made their presence known, but later when they reached the
smolénsk road they ran holding the clapper of their bell tight—and often
thinking they were escaping ran right into the russians.

owing to the rapidity of the french flight and the russian pursuit
and the consequent exhaustion of the horses, the chief means of
approximately ascertaining the enemy’s position—by cavalry scouting—was
not available. besides, as a result of the frequent and rapid change of

maneuvers or plans, again began running along the beaten track, neither
to the right nor to the left but along the old—the worst—road, through
krásnoe and orshá.

expecting the enemy from behind and not in front, the french separated
in their flight and spread out over a distance of twenty-four hours. in
front of them all fled the emperor, then the kings, then the dukes. the
russian army, expecting napoleon to take the road to the right beyond
the dnieper—which was the only reasonable thing for him to do—themselves
turned to the right and came out onto the highroad at krásnoe. and here
as in a game of blindman’s buff the french ran into our vanguard. seeing
their enemy unexpectedly the french fell into confusion and stopped
short from the sudden fright, but then they resumed their flight,
abandoning their comrades who were farther behind. then for three days

baggage, their artillery, and half their men, and fled, getting past the
russians by night by making semicircles to the right.

ney, who came last, had been busying himself blowing up the walls of
smolénsk which were in nobody’s way, because despite the unfortunate
plight of the french or because of it, they wished to punish the floor
against which they had hurt themselves. ney, who had had a corps of ten
thousand men, reached napoleon at orshá with only one thousand men left,
having abandoned all the rest and all his cannon, and having crossed the
dnieper at night by stealth at a wooded spot.

from orshá they fled farther along the road to vílna, still playing
at blindman’s buff with the pursuing army. at the berëzina they again
became disorganized, many were drowned and many surrendered, but those
who got across the river fled farther. their supreme chief donned a

oy themselves. from the time they turned onto
the kalúga road to the day their leader fled from the army, none of the
movements of the crowd had any sense. so one might have thought that
regarding this period of the campaign the historians, who attributed
the actions of the mass to the will of one man, would have found it
impossible to make the story of the retreat fit their theory. but
no! mountains of books have been written by the historians about this
campaign, and everywhere are described napoleon’s arrangements, the
maneuvers, and his profound plans which guided the army, as well as the
military genius shown by his marshals.

the retreat from málo-yaroslávets when he had a free road into a
well-supplied district and the parallel road was open to him along
which kutúzov afterwards pursued him—this unnecessary retreat along
a devastated road—is explained to us as being due to profound
considerations. similarly profound considerations are given for
his retreat from smolénsk to or

good or evil but only “grand” and “not grand.” grand is good, not
grand is bad. grand is the characteristic, in their conception, of some
special animals called “heroes.” and napoleon, escaping home in a warm

his strange fact given by russian military
historians (to the effect that kutúzov hindered an attack) is unfounded,
for we know that he could not restrain the troops from attacking at
vyázma and tarútino.

why was the russian army—which with inferior forces had withstood the
enemy in full strength at borodinó—defeated at krásnoe and the berëzina
by the disorganized crowds of the french when it was numerically
superior?

if the aim of the russians consisted in cutting off and capturing
napoleon and his marshals—and that aim was not merely frustrated but all
attempts to attain it were most shamefully baffled—then this last period
of the campaign is quite rightly considered by the french to be a
series of victories, and quite wrongly considered victorious by russian
historians.

the russian military historians in so far as they submit to claims
of logic must admit that conclusion, and in spite of their lyrical
rhapsodies about valor, devotion, and so forth, must reluctantly admit
th

at the french retreat from moscow was a series of victories for
napoleon and defeats for kutúzov.

but putting national vanity entirely aside one feels that such a
conclusion involves a contradiction, since the series of french
victories brought the french complete destruction, while the series
of russian defeats led to the total destruction of their enemy and the
liberation of their country.

the source of this contradiction lies in the fact that the historians
studying the events from the letters of the sovereigns and the generals,
from memoirs, reports, projects
 
 ___________________________
 
, and so forth, have attributed to this
last period of the war of 1812 an aim that never existed, namely that of
cutting off and capturing napoleon with his marshals and his army.

there never was or could have been such an aim, for it would have been
senseless and its attainment quite impossible.

it would have been senseless, first because napoleon’s disorganized
army was flying from russia with all possible speed, that is to say, was
doing just what every russian desired. so what was the use of performing
various operations on the french who were running away as fast as they
possibly could?

secondly, it would have been senseless to block the passage of men whose
whole energy was directed to flight.

thirdly, it would have been senseless to sacrifice one’s own troops in
order to destroy the french army, which without external interfe

or the russians, as the most adroit diplomatists of
the time (joseph de maistre and others) recognized. still more senseless
would have been the wish to capture army corps of the french, when our
own army had melted away to half before reaching krásnoe and a whole
division would have been needed to convoy the corps of prisoners, and
when our men were not always getting full rations and the prisoners
already taken were perishing of hunger.

all the profound plans about cutting off and capturing napoleon and his
army were like the plan of a market gardener who, when driving out of
his garden a cow that had trampled down the beds he had planted, should
run to the gate and hit the cow on the head. the only thing to be said
in excuse of that gardener would be that he was very angry. but not even
that could be said for those who drew up this project, for it was not
they who had suffered from the trampled beds.

but besides the fact that cutting off napoleon with his army would have
been senseless, 
 
 ___________________________
 
 because—as experience shows that a three-mile
movement of columns on a battlefield never coincides with the plans—the
probability of chichagóv, kutúzov, and wittgenstein effecting a junction
on time at an appointed place was so remote as to be tantamount to
impossibility, as in fact thought kutúzov, who when he received the plan
remarked that diversions planned over great distances do not yield the
desired results.

secondly it was impossible, because to paralyze the momentum with which
napoleon’s army was retiring, incomparably greater forces than the
russians possessed would have been required.

thirdly it was impossible, because the military term “to cut off” has no
meaning. one can cut off a slice of bread, but not an army. to cut off
an army—to bar its road—is quite impossible, for there is always plenty
of room to avoid capture and there is the night when nothing can be
seen, as the military scientists might convince themselves by the
example of krásnoe and of the ber

hat general received; but the question
of those fifty thousand men who were left in hospitals and in graves
does not even interest them, for it does not come within the range of
their investigation.

yet one need only discard the study of the reports and general plans and
consider the movement of those hundreds of thousands of men who took a
direct part in the events, and all the questions that seemed insoluble
easily and simply receive an immediate and certain solution.

the aim of cutting off napoleon and his army never existed except in
the imaginations of a dozen people. it could not exist because it was
senseless and unattainable.

the people had a single aim: to free their land from invasion. that aim
was attained in the first place of itself, as the french ran away,
and so it was only necessary not to stop their flight. secondly it was
attained by the guerrilla warfare which was destroying the french, and
thirdly by the fact that a large russian army was following the french,
ready to u

ian army which left that place a
hundred thousand strong reached krásnoe with only fifty thousand.

the rapidity of the russian pursuit was just as destructive to our army
as the flight of the french was to theirs. the only difference was that
the russian army moved voluntarily, with no such threat of destruction
as hung over the french, and that the sick frenchmen were left behind
in enemy hands while the sick russians left behind were among their
own people. the chief cause of the wastage of napoleon’s army was
the rapidity of its movement, and a convincing proof of this is the
corresponding decrease of the russian army.

kutúzov as far as was in his power, instead of trying to check the
movement of the french as was desired in petersburg and by the russian
army generals, directed his whole activity here, as he had done at
tarútino and vyázma, to hastening it on while easing the movement of our
army.

but besides this, since the exhaustion and enormous diminution of the
army caused by

who within a
month and without fighting a battle had dwindled to half their number,
and who at the best if the flight continued would have to go a greater
distance than they had already traversed, before they reached the
frontier.

this longing to distinguish themselves, to maneuver, to overthrow, and
to cut off showed itself particularly whenever the russians stumbled on
the french army.

so it was at krásnoe, where they expected to find one of the three
french columns and stumbled instead on napoleon himself with sixteen
thousand men. despite all kutúzov’s efforts to avoid that ruinous
encounter and to preserve his troops, the massacre of the broken mob
of french soldiers by worn-out russians continued at krásnoe for three
days.

etc. and as usual nothing happened in accord with the disposition.

rt to the column presented
to them—that is to say, to a crowd of frenchmen stark with cold,
frost-bitten, and starving—and the column that had been presented to
them threw down its arms and surrendered as it had long been anxious to
do.

at krásnoe they took twenty-six thousand prisoners, several hundred
cannon, and a stick called a “marshal’s staff,” and disputed as to who
had distinguished himself and were pleased with their achievement—though
they much regretted not having taken napoleon, or at least a marshal or
a hero of some sort, and reproached one another and especially kutúzov
for having failed to do so.

these men, carried away by their passions, were but blind tools of the
most melancholy law of necessity, but considered themselves heroes and
imagined that they were accomplishing a most noble and honorable
deed. they blamed kutúzov and said that from the very beginning of the
campaign he had prevented their vanquishing napoleon, that he thought of

ng his passions and would not advance from the linen
factories because he was comfortable there, that at krásnoe he checked
the advance because on learning that napoleon was there he had quite
lost his head, and that it was probable that he had an understanding
with napoleon and had been bribed by him, and so on, and so on.

not only did his contemporaries, carried away by their passions, talk
in this way, but posterity and history have acclaimed napoleon as grand,
while kutúzov is described by foreigners as a crafty, dissolute, weak
old courtier, and by russians as something indefinite—a sort of puppet
useful only because he had a russian name.

such is the fate not of great men (grands hommes) whom the russian mind
does not acknowledge, but of those rare and always solitary individuals
who, discerning the will of providence, submit their personal will to
it. the hatred and contempt of the crowd punish such men for discerning
the higher laws.

for russian historians, strange and terrible to say, napoleon—that most
insignificant tool of history who never anywhere, even in exile, showed
human dignity—napoleon is the object of adulation and enthusiasm; he
is grand. but kutúzov—the man who from the beginning to the end of his
activity in 1812, never once swerving by word or deed from borodinó to

and a present consciousness of the future importance of what was

and still is written about the berëzina, on the french side this is only
because at the broken bridge across that river the calamities their army
had been previously enduring were suddenly concentrated at one moment
into a tragic spectacle that remained in every memory, and on the
russian side merely because in petersburg—far from the seat of war—a
plan (again one of pfuel’s) had been devised to catch napoleon in a
strategic trap at the berëzina river. everyone assured himself that all
would happen according to plan, and therefore insisted that it was just
the crossing of the berëzina that destroyed the french army. in reality
the results of the crossing were much less disastrous to the french—in
guns and men lost—than krásnoe had been, as the figures show.

the sole importance of the crossing of the berëzina lies in the fact
that it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans

kutúzov’s and animated by different motives.

alexander i was as necessary for the movement of the peoples from east
to west and for the refixing of national frontiers as kutúzov had been
for the salvation and glory of russia.

kutúzov did not understand what europe, the balance of power, or
napoleon meant. he could not understand it. for the representative of
the russian people, after the enemy had been destroyed and russia had
been liberated and raised to the summit of her glory, there was nothing
left to do as a russian. nothing remained for the representative of the
national war but to die, and kutúzov died.

there were several prisoners from the french army in orël, and the

this officer began visiting pierre, and the princess used to make fun of
the tenderness the italian expressed for him.

the italian seemed happy only when he could come to see pierre, talk
with him, tell him about his past, his life at home, and his love,
and pour out to him his indignátion against the french and especially
against napoleon.

“if all russians are in the least like you, it is sacrilege to fight
such a nation,” he said to pierre. “you, who have suffered so from the
french, do not even feel animosity toward them.”

pierre had evoked the passionate affection of the italian merely by
evoking the best side of his nature and taking a pleasure in so doing.

stern, and he fancied even contemptuous.

“and did you really see and speak to napoleon, as we have been told?”
said princess mary.

pierre laughed.

“no, not once! everybody seems to imagine that being taken prisoner
means being napoleon’s guest. not only did i never see him but i heard
nothing about him—i was in much lower company!”

the historians call this activity of the historical figures “the

in dealing with this period they sternly condemn the historical
personages who, in their opinion, caused what they describe as the
reaction. all the well-known people of that period, from alexander and
napoleon to madame de staël, photius, schelling, fichte, chateaubriand,
and the rest, pass before their stern judgment seat and are acquitted or
condemned according to whether they conduced to progress or to reaction.

according to their accounts a reaction took place at that time in russia
also, and the chief culprit was alexander i, the same man who according
to them was the chief cause of the liberal movement at the commencement
of his reign, being the savior of russia.

disbanding the semënov regiment.”

it would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches the
historians address to him, based on their knowledge of what is good for
humanity.

what do these reproaches mean?

do not the very actions for which the historians praise alexander i
(the liberal attempts at the beginning of his reign, his struggle with
napoleon, the firmness he displayed in 1812 and the campaign of 1813)
flow from the same sources—the circumstances of his birth, education,
and life—that made his personality what it was and from which the
actions for which they blame him (the holy alliance, the restoration of
poland, and the reaction of 1820 and later) also flowed?

in what does the substance of those reproaches lie?

it lies in the fact that an historic character like alexander i,
standing on the highest possible pinnacle of human

 movement of history, we see that every year and with each new
writer, opinion as to what is good for mankind changes; so that what
once seemed good, ten years later seems bad, and vice versa. and what is
more, we find at one and the same time quite contradictory views as to
what is bad and what is good in history: some people regard giving a
constitution to poland and forming the holy alliance as praiseworthy in
alexander, while others regard it as blameworthy.

the activity of alexander or of napoleon cannot be called useful or
harmful, for it is impossible to say for what it was useful or harmful.
if that activity displeases somebody, this is only because it does
not agree with his limited understanding of what is good. whether the
preservation of my father’s house in moscow, or the glory of the russian
arms, or the prosperity of the petersburg and other universities, or the

we need only confess that we do not know the purpose of the european

and in russia—and that the movements from the west to the east and from
the east to the west form the essence and purpose of these events, and
not only shall we have no need to see exceptional ability and genius in
napoleon and alexander, but we shall be unable to consider them to
be anything but like other men, and we shall not be obliged to have
recourse to chance for an explanation of those small events which made
these people what they were, but it will be clear that all those small

the european peoples from west to east and afterwards from east to west.

europe. the strength of the justification of the man who stands at the
head of the movement grows with the increased size of the group. during
the ten-year preparatory period this man had formed relations with all
the crowned heads of europe. the discredited rulers of the world can
oppose no reasonable ideal to the insensate napoleonic ideal of
glory and grandeur. one after another they hasten to display their
insignificance before him. the king of prussia sends his wife to seek
the great man’s mercy; the emperor of austria considers it a favor that
this man receives a daughter of the caesars into his bed; the pope, the
guardian of all that the nations hold sacred, utilizes religion for the
aggrandizement of the great man. it is not napoleon who prepares himself

suddenly instead of those chances and that genius which hitherto had
so consistently led him by an uninterrupted series of successes to the
predestined goal, an innumerable sequence of inverse chances occur—from
the cold in his head at borodinó to the sparks which set moscow on
fire, and the frosts—and instead of genius, stupidity and immeasurable
baseness become evident.

the invaders flee, turn back, flee again, and all the chances are now
not for napoleon but always against him.

a countermovement is then accomplished from east to west with a
remarkable resemblance to the preceding movement from west to east.
attempted drives from east to west—similar to the contrary movements of
1805, 1807, and 1809—precede the great westward movement; there is the

paris, the ultimate goal, is reached. the napoleonic government and army
are destroyed. napoleon himself is no longer of any account; all his
actions are evidently pitiful and mean, but again an inexplicable chance
occurs. the allies detest napoleon whom they regard as the cause of
their sufferings. deprived of power and authority, his crimes and his
craft exposed, he should have appeared to them what he appeared ten
years previously and one year later—an outlawed brigand. but by some
strange chance no one perceives this. his part is not yet ended. the man
who ten years before and a year later was considered an outlawed brigand

what was needed for him who, overshadowing others, stood at the head of
that movement from east to west?

what was needed was a sense of justice and a sympathy with european
affairs, but a remote sympathy not dulled by petty interests; a moral
superiority over those sovereigns of the day who co-operated with him;
a mild and attractive personality; and a personal grievance against
napoleon. and all this was found in alexander i; all this had been
prepared by innumerable so-called chances in his life: his education,
his early liberalism, the advisers who surrounded him, and by
austerlitz, and tilsit, and erfurt.

during the national war he was inactive because he was not needed. but
as soon as the necessity for a general european war presented itself he
appeared in his place at the given moment and, uniting the nations of
europe, led them to the goal.

what force made men act so? these are the instinctive, plain, and
most legitimate questions humanity asks itself when it encounters the
monuments and tradition of that period.

for a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind turns to the
science of history, whose aim is to enable nations and humanity to know
themselves.

if history had retained the conception of the ancients it would have
said that god, to reward or punish his people, gave napoleon power and
directed his will to the fulfillment of the divine ends, and that reply
would have been clear and complete. one might believe or disbelieve
in the divine significance of napoleon, but for anyone believing in
it there would have been nothing unintelligible in the history of that
period, nor would there have been any contradictions.

such and such favorites and such and such mistresses. moreover, certain
men wrote some books at that time. at the end of the eighteenth century
there were a couple of dozen men in paris who began to talk about all
men being free and equal. this caused people all over france to begin
to slash at and drown one another. they killed the king and many other
people. at that time there was in france a man of genius—napoleon. he
conquered everybody everywhere—that is, he killed many people because
he was a great genius. and for some reason he went to kill africans, and
killed them so well and was so cunning and wise that when he returned to
france he ordered everybody to obey him, and they all obeyed him. having
become an emperor he again went out to kill people in italy, austria,
and prussia. and there too he killed a great many. in russia there
was an emperor, alexander, who decided to restore order in europe a

therefore fought against napoleon. in 1807 he suddenly made friends
with him, but in 1811 they again quarreled and again began killing many
people. napoleon led six hundred thousand men into russia and captured
moscow; then he suddenly ran away from moscow, and the emperor
alexander, helped by the advice of stein and others, united europe to
arm against the disturber of its peace. all napoleon’s allies suddenly
became his enemies and their forces advanced against the fresh forces he
raised. the allies defeated napoleon, entered paris, forced napoleon to
abdicate, and sent him to the island of elba, not depriving him of the
title of emperor and showing him every respect, though five years before
and one year later they all regarded him as an outlaw and a brigand.

these conversations made the nations happy or unhappy. suddenly the
diplomatists and monarchs nearly quarreled and were on the point of

arrived in france with a battalion, and the french, who had been hating
him, immediately all submitted to him. but the allied monarchs were
angry at this and went to fight the french once more. and they defeated

the strangeness and absurdity of these replies arise from the fact that
modern history, like a deaf man, answers questions no one has asked.

if the purpose of history be to give a description of the movement of
humanity and of the peoples, the first question—in the absence of a
reply to which all the rest will be incomprehensible—is: what is the
power that moves peoples? to this, modern history laboriously replies
either that napoleon was a great genius, or that louis xiv was very
proud, or that certain writers wrote certain books.

all that may be so and mankind is ready to agree with it, but it is not
what was asked. all that would be interesting if we recognized a divine
power based on itself and always consistently directing its nations
through napoleons, louis-es, and writers; but we do not acknowledge such
a power, and therefore before speaking about napoleons, louis-es, and
authors, we ought to be shown the connection

what force moves the nations?

biographical historians and historians of separate nations understand
this force as a power inherent in heroes and rulers. in their narration
events occur solely by the will of a napoleon, and alexander, or in
general of the persons they describe. the answers given by this kind
of historian to the question of what force causes events to happen are
satisfactory only as long as there is but one historian to each event.
as soon as historians of different nationalities and tendencies begin
to describe the same event, the replies they give immediately lose all
meaning, for this force is understood by them all not only differently
but often in quite contradictory ways. one historian s

ays that an
event was produced by napoleon’s power, another that it was produced by
alexander’s, a third that it was due to the power of some other person.
besides this, historians of that kind contradict each other even
in their statement as to the force on which the authority of some
particular person was based. thiers, a bonapartist, says that napoleon’s
power was based on his virtue and genius. lanfrey, a republican, says it
was based on his trickery and deception of the people. so the historians
of this class, by mutually destroying one another’s positions, destroy
the understanding of the force which produces events, and furnish no
reply to history’s essential question.

writers of universal history who deal with all the nations seem to
recognize how erroneous is the specialist historians’ view of the force
which produces events. t

product of many forces, can no longer, it would seem, be regarded
as a force that itself produces events. yet in most cases universal
historians still employ the conception of power as a force that itself
produces events, and treat it as their cause. in their exposition, an
historic character is first the product of his time, and his power only
the resultant of various forces, and then his power is itself a force
producing events. gervinus, schlosser, and others, for instance, at one
time prove napoleon to be a product of the revolution, of the ideas of
1789 and so forth, and at another plainly say that the campaign of 1812
and other things they do not like were simply the product of napoleon’s
misdirected will, and that the very ideas of 1789 were arrested in their
development by napoleon’s caprice. the ideas of the revolution and the
general temper of the age produced napoleon’s power. but napoleon’s
power suppressed the ideas of the revolution and the general temper of
the age.

 even admitting as correct all the cunningly devised arguments with
which these histories are filled—admitting that nations are governed by
some undefined force called an idea—history’s essential question still
remains unanswered, and to the former power of monarchs and to the
influence of advisers and other people introduced by the universal
historians, another, newer force—the idea—is added, the connection of
which with the masses needs explanation. it is possible to understand
that napoleon had power and so events occurred; with some effort one may
even conceive that napoleon together with other influences was the cause
of an event; but how a book, le contrat social, had the effect of making
frenchmen begin to drown one another cannot be understood without an
explanation of the causal nexus of this new force with the event.

histories of culture, to which all general histories tend more and more
to approximate, are significant from the fact that after seriously
and minutely examining various religious, philosophic, and political
doctrines as causes of events, as soon as they have to describe an
actual historic event such as the campaign of 1812 for instance, they
involuntarily describe it as resulting from an exercise of power—and say
plainly that that was the result of napoleon’s will. speaking so, the
historians of culture involuntarily contradict themselves, and show that
the new force they have devised does not account for what happens in
history, and that history can only be explained by introducing a power
which they apparently do not recognize.

doubts concerning the real value of such histories arise either because
too many of them are written or because in his simplicity of heart
someone inquires: by what force did napoleon do this?—that is, wants
to exchange the current paper money for the real gold of actual
comprehension.

the writers of universal histories and of the history of culture are
like people who, recognizing the defects of paper money, decide to
substitute for it money made of metal that has not the specific gravity

ion to some chosen man and the subjection
of that man’s will to the deity, history cannot without contradictions
take a single step till it has chosen one of two things: either a return
to the former belief in the direct intervention of the deity in human
affairs or a definite explanation of the meaning of the force producing
historical events and termed “power.”

a return to the first is impossible, the belief has been destroyed; and
so it is essential to explain what is meant by power.

napoleon ordered an army to be raised and go to war. we are so
accustomed to that idea and have become so used to it that the question:
why did six hundred thousand men go to fight when napoleon uttered
certain words, seems to us senseless. he had the power and so what he
ordered was done.

this reply is quite satisfactory if we believe that the power was given
him by god. but as soon as we do not admit that, it becomes essential to
determine what is this power of one man over others.

it cannot be the

direct physical power of a strong man over a weak one—a
domination based on the application or threat of physical force, like
the power of hercules; nor can it be based on the effect of moral force,
as in their simplicity some historians think who say that the leading
figures in history are heroes, that is, men gifted with a special
strength of soul and mind called genius. this power cannot be based on
the predominance of moral strength, for, not to mention heroes such as
napoleon about whose moral qualities opinions differ widely, history
shows us that neither a louis xi nor a metternich, who ruled over
millions of people, had any particular moral qualities, but on the
contrary were generally morally weaker than any of the millions they
ruled over.

if the source of power lies neither in the physical nor in the moral
qualities of him who possesses it, it must evidently be looked for
elsewhere—in the relation to the people of the man who wields the power.

his fundamental difference between the view held by history and
that held by jurisprudence, it follows that jurisprudence can tell
minutely how in its opinion power should be constituted and what
power—existing immutably outside time—is, but to history’s questions
about the meaning of the mutations of power in time it can answer
nothing.

if power be the collective will of the people transferred to their
ruler, was pugachëv a representative of the will of the people? if not,
then why was napoleon i? why was napoleon iii a criminal when he was
taken prisoner at boulogne, and why, later on, were those criminals whom
he arrested?

do palace revolutions—in which sometimes only two or three people take
part—transfer the will of the people to a new ruler? in international
relations, is the will of the people also transferred to their
conqueror? was the will of the confederation of the rhine transferred
to napoleon in 1806? was the will of the russian people transferred

xiv’s activity, contrary to the program, reacted on
louis xvi. but why did it not react on louis xiv or on louis xv—why
should it react just on louis xvi? and what is the time limit for such
reactions? to these questions there are and can be no answers. equally
little does this view explain why for several centuries the collective
will is not withdrawn from certain rulers and their heirs, and
then suddenly during a period of fifty years is transferred to the
convention, to the directory, to napoleon, to alexander, to louis xviii,
to napoleon again, to charles x, to louis philippe, to a republican
government, and to napoleon iii. when explaining these rapid transfers
of the people’s will from one individual to another, especially in view
of international relations, conquests, and alliances, the historians are
obliged to admit that some of these transfers are not normal delegations
of the people’s will but are accidents dependent on cunning, on
mistakes, on craft, or on the weakness of a

those leaders?

the leaders, these historians tell us, express the will of the people:
the activity of the leaders represents the activity of the people.

but in that case the question arises whether all the activity of the
leaders serves as an expression of the people’s will or only some part
of it. if the whole activity of the leaders serves as the expression of
the people’s will, as some historians suppose, then all the details
of the court scandals contained in the biographies of a napoleon or
a catherine serve to express the life of the nation, which is evident
nonsense; but if it is only some particular side of the activity of an
historical leader which serves to express the people’s life, as other
so-called “philosophical” historians believe, then to determine which
side of the activity of a leader expresses the nation’s life, we have
first of all to know in what the nation’s life consists.

activity of the millions who migrate, burn houses, abandon agriculture,

history proves this at every turn. is the ferment of the peoples of
the west at the end of the eighteenth century and their drive eastward

and ministers, and by the lives of napoleon, rousseau, diderot,

his correspondence with kúrbski?

has, besides abstract reasoning, experience by which he verifies his
reflections. and experience tells us that power is not merely a word but
an actually existing phenomenon.

not to speak of the fact that no description of the collective activity
of men can do without the conception of power, the existence of power is
proved both by history and by observing contemporary events.

whenever an event occurs a man appears or men appear, by whose will the
event seems to have taken place. napoleon iii issues a decree and the
french go to mexico. the king of prussia and bismarck issue decrees and
an army enters bohemia. napoleon i issues a decree and an army enters
russia. alexander i gives a command and the french submit to the
bourbons. experience shows us that whatever event occurs it is always
related to the will of one or of several men who have decreed it.

intervention in human affairs, want to see the cause of ev

in time and himself takes part in what occurs.

reinstating the first condition omitted, that of time, we see that no
command can be executed without some preceding order having been given
rendering the execution of the last command possible.

no command ever appears spontaneously, or itself covers a whole series
of occurrences; but each command follows from another, and never refers
to a whole series of events but always to one moment only of an event.

when, for instance, we say that napoleon ordered armies to go to war,
we combine in one simultaneous expression a whole series of consecutive
commands dependent one on another. napoleon could not have commanded
an invasion of russia and never did so. today he ordered such and such
papers to be written to vienna, to berlin, and to petersburg;
tomorrow such and such decrees and orders to the army, the fleet, the
commissariat, and so on and so on—millions of commands, which formed
a whole series corresponding to a series of events whic

if throughout his reign napoleon gave commands concerning an invasion
of england and expended on no other undertaking so much time and effort,
and yet during his whole reign never once attempted to execute that
design but undertook an expedition into russia, with which country he
considered it desirable to be in alliance (a conviction he repeatedly
expressed)—this came about because his commands did not correspond to
the course of events in the first case, but did so correspond in the
latter.

executed is impossible, not only in the case of napoleon’s invasion of
russia in which millions participated, but even in the simplest event,
for in either case millions of obstacles may arise to prevent its
execution. every order executed is always one of an immense number
unexecuted. all the impossible orders inconsistent with the course of
events remain unexecuted. only the possible ones get linked up with a
consecutive series of commands corresponding to a series of events, and
are executed.

d because they could not be. apart from that, the chief source
of our error in this matter is due to the fact that in the historical
accounts a whole series of innumerable, diverse, and petty events, such
for instance as all those which led the french armies to russia, is
generalized into one event in accord with the result produced by that
series of events, and corresponding with this generalization the whole
series of commands is also generalized into a single expression of will.

we say that napoleon wished to invade russia and invaded it. in
reality in all napoleon’s activity we never find anything resembling an
expression of that wish, but find a series of orders, or expressions of
his will, very variously and indefinitely directed. amid a long series
of unexecuted orders of napoleon’s one series, for the campaign of 1812,
was carried out—not because those orders differed in any way from the

conception of freedom and inevitability themselves from the immense
quantity of phenomena of which it is cognizant and that always appear
dependent on these two elements.

whatever presentation of the activity of many men or of an individual
we may consider, we always regard it as the result partly of man’s free
will and partly of the law of inevitability.

whether we speak of the migration of the peoples and the incursions
of the barbarians, or of the decrees of napoleon iii, or of someone’s
action an hour ago in choosing one direction out of several for his
walk, we are unconscious of any contradiction. the degree of freedom and
inevitability governing the actions of these people is clearly defined
for us.

our conception of the degree of freedom often varies according to
differences in the point of view from which we regard the event, but
every human action appears to us as a certain combination of freedom and
inevitability. in every action we examine we se

contemporary event seems to us to be indubitably the doing of all the
known participants, but with a more remote event we already see its
inevitable results which prevent our considering anything else possible.
and the farther we go back in examining events the less arbitrary do
they appear.

the austro-prussian war appears to us undoubtedly the result of the
crafty conduct of bismarck, and so on. the napoleonic wars still seem
to us, though already questionably, to be the outcome of their heroes’
will. but in the crusades we already see an event occupying its definite
place in history and without which we cannot imagine the modern history
of europe, though to the chroniclers of the crusades that event appeared
as merely due to the will of certain people. in regard to the migration
of the peoples it does not enter anyone’s head today to suppose that
