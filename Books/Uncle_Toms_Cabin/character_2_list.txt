Arthur Shelby - 
                The
owner of Uncle Tom in Kentucky, Shelby sells Tom to the cruel Mr.
Haley to pay off his debts. An educated, kind, and basically good-hearted
man, Shelby nonetheless tolerates and perpetuates slavery. Stowe
uses him to illustrate that the immorality inherent in slavery makes
villains of all its practitioners--not just the most cruel masters.
