the shutting-up of shop-shutters.  not until the light porter announced
that her nocturnal sweetbread was ready, did mrs. sparsit arouse herself
from her reverie, and convey her dense black eyebrowsâ€”by that time
creased with meditation, as if they needed ironing out-up-stairs.

â€˜o, you fool!â€™ said mrs. sparsit, when she was alone at her supper.  whom
she meant, she did not say; but she could scarcely have meant the
sweetbread.



chapter ii
mr. james harthouse


the gradgrind party wanted assistance in cutting the throats of the
graces.  they went about recruiting; and where could they enlist recruits
more hopefully, than among the fine gentlemen who, having found out
everything to be worth nothing, were equally ready for anything?

moreover, the healthy spirits who had mounted to this sublime height were
attractive to many of the gradgrind school.  they liked fine gentlemen;
they pretended that they did not, but they did.  they became exhausted in

andsome dog who can make you a devilish good speech,
look after my brother jem, for heâ€™s your man.â€™  after a few dashes in the
public meeting way, mr. gradgrind and a council of political sages
approved of jem, and it was resolved to send him down to coketown, to
become known there and in the neighbourhood.  hence the letter jem had
last night shown to mrs. sparsit, which mr. bounderby now held in his
hand; superscribed, â€˜josiah bounderby, esquire, banker, coketown.
specially to introduce james harthouse, esquire.  thomas gradgrind.â€™

within an hour of the receipt of this dispatch and mr. james harthouseâ€™s
card, mr. bounderby put on his hat and went down to the hotel.  there he
found mr. james harthouse looking out of window, in a state of mind so
disconsolate, that he was already half-disposed to â€˜go inâ€™ for something
else.

â€˜my name, sir,â€™ said his visitor, â€˜is josiah bounderby, of coketown.â€™

mr. james harthouse was very happy indeed (though he scarcely looked so)
to have a p

â€˜mr. bounderby,â€™ said jem, â€˜you anticipate my dearest wishes.â€™

they went out without further discourse; and mr. bounderby piloted the
new acquaintance who so strongly contrasted with him, to the private red
brick dwelling, with the black outside shutters, the green inside blinds,
and the black street door up the two white steps.  in the drawing-room of
which mansion, there presently entered to them the most remarkable girl
mr. james harthouse had ever seen.  she was so constrained, and yet so
careless; so reserved, and yet so watchful; so cold and proud, and yet so
sensitively ashamed of her husbandâ€™s braggart humilityâ€”from which she
shrunk as if every example of it were a cut or a blow; that it was quite
a new sensation to observe her.  in face she was no less remarkable than
in manner.  her features were handsome; but their natural play was so
locked up, that it seemed impossible to guess at their genuine
expression.  utterly

her influence.  cheerless and comfortless, boastfully and doggedly rich,
there the room stared at its present occupants, unsoftened and unrelieved
by the least trace of any womanly occupation.  as mr. bounderby stood in
the midst of his household gods, so those unrelenting divinities occupied
their places around mr. bounderby, and they were worthy of one another,
and well matched.

â€˜this, sir,â€™ said bounderby, â€˜is my wife, mrs. bounderby: tom gradgrindâ€™s
eldest daughter.  loo, mr. james harthouse.  mr. harthouse has joined
your fatherâ€™s muster-roll.  if he is not tom gradgrindâ€™s colleague before
long, i believe we shall at least hear of him in connexion with one of
our neighbouring towns.  you observe, mr. harthouse, that my wife is my
junior.  i donâ€™t know what she saw in me to marry me, but she saw
something in me, i suppose, or she wouldnâ€™t have married me.  she has
lots of expensive knowledge, sir, political and otherwise.  if you want

â€˜you are a singular politician,â€™ said louisa.

â€˜pardon me; i have not even that merit.  we are the largest party in the
state, i assure you, mrs. bounderby, if we all fell out of our adopted
ranks and were reviewed together.â€™

mr. bounderby, who had been in danger of bursting in silence, interposed
here with a project for postponing the family dinner till half-past six,
and taking mr. james harthouse in the meantime on a round of visits to
the voting and interesting notabilities of coketown and its vicinity.
the round of visits was made; and mr. james harthouse, with a discreet
use of his blue coaching, came off triumphantly, though with a
considerable accession of boredom.

in the evening, he found the dinner-table laid for four, but they sat
down only three.  it was an appropriate occasion for mr. bounderby to
discuss the flavour of the hapâ€™orth of stewed eels he had purchased in
the st

 again to-morrow
morning, had he been less curious respecting louisa.

â€˜is there nothing,â€™ he thought, glancing at her as she sat at the head of
the table, where her youthful figure, small and slight, but very
graceful, looked as pretty as it looked misplaced; â€˜is there nothing that
will move that face?â€™

yes!  by jupiter, there was something, and here it was, in an unexpected
shape.  tom appeared.  she changed as the door opened, and broke into a
beaming smile.

a beautiful smile.  mr. james harthouse might not have thought so much of
it, but that he had wondered so long at her impassive face.  she put out
her handâ€”a pretty little soft hand; and her fingers closed upon her
brotherâ€™s, as if she would have carried them to her lips.

â€˜ay, ay?â€™ thought the visitor.  â€˜this whelp is the only creature she
cares for.  so, so!â€™

the whelp was presented, and took his chair.  the appellation was not
flattering, but not unmerited.

â€˜when i was your age, young tom,â€™ said bounderby, â€˜i w

was educated here, at home.  tom, love, i am telling mr. harthouse that
he never saw you abroad.â€™

â€˜no such luck, sir,â€™ said tom.

there was little enough in him to brighten her face, for he was a sullen
young fellow, and ungracious in his manner even to her.  so much the
greater must have been the solitude of her heart, and her need of some
one on whom to bestow it.  â€˜so much the more is this whelp the only
creature she has ever cared for,â€™ thought mr. james harthouse, turning it
over and over.  â€˜so much the more.  so much the more.â€™

both in his sisterâ€™s presence, and after she had left the room, the whelp
took no pains to hide his contempt for mr. bounderby, whenever he could
indulge it without the observation of that independent man, by making wry
faces, or shutting one eye.  without responding to these telegraphic
communications, mr. harthouse encouraged him much in the course of the
evening, and showed an unusual liking for him.  at last, when he

t it was certainly the case with tom.  it was very strange
that a young gentleman who had never been left to his own guidance for
five consecutive minutes, should be incapable at last of governing
himself; but so it was with tom.  it was altogether unaccountable that a
young gentleman whose imagination had been strangled in his cradle,
should be still inconvenienced by its ghost in the form of grovelling
sensualities; but such a monster, beyond all doubt, was tom.

â€˜do you smoke?â€™ asked mr. james harthouse, when they came to the hotel.

â€˜i believe you!â€™ said tom.

he could do no less than ask tom up; and tom could do no less than go up.
what with a cooling drink adapted to the weather, but not so weak as
cool; and what with a rarer tobacco than was to be bought in those parts;
tom was soon in a highly free and easy state at his end of the sofa, and
more than ever disposed to admire his new friend at the other end.

tom blew his smoke aside, after he had been smoking a little while, and
took a

dress,â€™ thought tom, â€˜and yet how capitally he does it.  what an easy
swell he is!â€™

mr. james harthouse, happening to catch tomâ€™s eye, remarked that he drank
nothing, and filled his glass with his own negligent hand.

â€˜thankâ€™ee,â€™ said tom.  â€˜thankâ€™ee.  well, mr. harthouse, i hope you have
had about a dose of old bounderby to-night.â€™  tom said this with one eye
shut up again, and looking over his glass knowingly, at his entertainer.

â€˜a very good fellow indeed!â€™ returned mr. james harthouse.

â€˜you think so, donâ€™t you?â€™ said tom.  and shut up his eye again.

use smiled; and rising from his end of the sofa, and
lounging with his back against the chimney-piece, so that he stood before
the empty fire-grate as he smoked, in front of tom and looking down at
him, observed:

â€˜what a comical brother-in-law you are!â€™

â€˜what a comical brother-in-law old bounderby is, i think you mean,â€™ said
tom.

â€˜you are a piece of caustic, tom,â€™ retorted mr. james harthouse.

there was something so very agreeable in being so intimate with such a
waistcoat; in being called tom, in such an intimate way, by such a voice;
in being on such off-hand terms so soon, with such a pair of whiskers;
that tom was uncommonly pleased with himself.

â€˜oh!  i donâ€™t care for old bounderby,â€™ said he, â€˜if you mean that.  i
have always called old bounderby by the same name when i have talked
about him, and i have always thought of him in the same way.  i am not

â€˜donâ€™t mind me,â€™ returned james; â€˜but take care when his wife is by, you
know.â€™

â€˜his wife?â€™ said tom.  â€˜my sister loo?  o yes!â€™  and he laughed, and took
a little more of the cooling drink.

james harthouse continued to lounge in the same place and attitude,
smoking his cigar in his own easy way, and looking pleasantly at the
whelp, as if he knew himself to be a kind of agreeable demon who had only
to hover over him, and he must give up his whole soul if required.  it
certainly did seem that the whelp yielded to this influence.  he looked
at his companion sneakingly, he looked at him admiringly, he looked at
him boldly, and put up one leg on the sofa.

â€˜my sister loo?â€™ said tom.  â€˜_she_ neve

â€˜thatâ€™s the past tense, tom,â€™ returned mr. james harthouse, striking the
ash from his cigar with his little finger.  â€˜we are in the present tense,
now.â€™

â€˜verb neuter, not to care.  indicative mood, present tense.  first person
singular, i do not care; second person singular, thou dost not care;
third person singular, she does not care,â€™ returned tom.

â€˜good!  very quaint!â€™ said his friend.  â€˜though you donâ€™t mean it.â€™

â€˜but i _do_ mean it,â€™ cried tom.  â€˜upon my honour!  why, you wonâ€™t tell

g with the back of his head on the end of the sofa,
and smoking with an infinite assumption of negligence, turned his common
face, and not too sober eyes, towards the face looking down upon him so
carelessly yet so potently.

â€˜you know our governor, mr. harthouse,â€™ said tom, â€˜and therefore, you
neednâ€™t be surprised that loo married old bounderby.  she never had a
lover, and the governor proposed old bounderby, and she took him.â€™

â€˜very dutiful in your interesting sister,â€™ said mr. james harthouse.

â€˜yes, but she wouldnâ€™t have been as dutiful, and it would not have come
off as easily,â€™ returned the whelp, â€˜if it hadnâ€™t been for me.â€™

the tempter merely lifted his eyebrows; but the whelp was obliged to go
on.

â€˜_i_ persuaded her,â€™ he said, with an edifying air of superiority.  â€˜i
was stuck into old bounderbyâ€™s bank (where i never wanted to be), and i
knew i should get into scrapes there, if she put old bounderbyâ€™s pipe
out; so i told her my wishes, and she came into

me that she had nothing to fall back upon, that girls usually fall back

can always get on, somehow.â€™

â€˜calling at the bank yesterday evening, for mr. bounderbyâ€™s address, i
found an ancient lady there, who seems to entertain great admiration for
your sister,â€™ observed mr. james harthouse, throwing away the last small
remnant of the cigar he had now smoked out.

â€˜mother sparsit!â€™ said tom.  â€˜what! you have seen her already, have you?â€™

his friend nodded.  tom took his cigar out of his mouth, to shut up his
eye (which had grown rather unmanageable) with the greater expression,
and to tap his nose several times with his finger.

â€˜mother sparsitâ€™s feeling for loo is more than admiration, i should
think,â€™ said tom.  â€˜say affection and devotion.  mother sparsit never

more, quite unconscious of it though he was, than by seeming to appeal to
any one else, â€˜if you will favour me with your attention for half a

that you had nothing to tell us about this business.  you are quite sure
of that before we go any further.â€™

â€˜sir, i am sure on â€™t.â€™

â€˜hereâ€™s a gentleman from london present,â€™ mr. bounderby made a backhanded
point at mr. james harthouse with his thumb, â€˜a parliament gentleman.  i
should like him to hear a short bit of dialogue between you and me,
instead of taking the substance of itâ€”for i know precious well,
beforehand, what it will be; nobody knows better than i do, take
notice!â€”instead of receiving it on trust from my mouth.â€™

stephen bent his head to the gentleman from london, and showed a rather
more troubled mind than usual.  he turned his eyes involuntarily to his
former refuge, but at a look from that quarter (

so strange to turn from the chimneys to the birds.  so strange, to have
the road-dust on his feet instead of the coal-grit.  so strange to have
lived to his time of life, and yet to be beginning like a boy this summer
morning!  with these musings in his mind, and his bundle under his arm,
stephen took his attentive face along the high road.  and the trees
arched over him, whispering that he left a true and loving heart behind.

mr. james harthouse, â€˜going inâ€™ for his adopted party, soon began to
score.  with the aid of a little more coaching for the political sages, a
little more genteel listlessness for the general society, and a tolerable
management of the assumed honesty in dishonesty, most effective and most
patronized of the polite deadly sins, he speedily came to be considered
of much promise.  the not being troubled with earnestness was a grand
point in his favour, enabling him to take to the hard fact fellows with

e had expected, was young, and
remarkably pretty.  after that, he wrote no more about them, and devoted
his leisure chiefly to their house.  he was very often in their house, in
his flittings and visitings about the coketown district; and was much
encouraged by mr. bounderby.  it was quite in mr. bounderbyâ€™s gusty way
to boast to all his world that _he_ didnâ€™t care about your highly
connected people, but that if his wife tom gradgrindâ€™s daughter did, she
was welcome to their company.

mr. james harthouse began to think it would be a new sensation, if the
face which changed so beautifully for the whelp, would change for him.

he was quick enough to observe; he had a good memory, and did not forget
a word of the brotherâ€™s revelations.  he interwove them with everything
he saw of the sister, and he began to understand her.  to be sure, the
better and profounder part of her character was not within his scope of
perception; for in natures, as in seas, depth answers unto depth; but he
soon began to

â€˜you will understand, mr. harthouse,â€™ she returned, after some
indecision: she had been more or less uncertain, and troubled throughout
the conversation, and yet had in the main preserved her self-contained
manner; â€˜you will understand that if i tell you what you press to know,
it is not by way of complaint or regret.  i would never complain of
anything, and what i have done i do not in the least regret.â€™

â€˜so spirited, too!â€™ thought james harthouse.

â€˜when i married, i found that my brother was even at that time heavily in
debt.  heavily for him, i mean.  heavily enough to oblige me to sell some
trinkets.  they were no sacrifice.  i sold them very willingly.  i
attached no value to them.  they, were quite worthless to me.â€™

conscience that he knew, that she spoke of some of her husbandâ€™s gifts.

not obliged to say what she is going to do with it; she is sharp enough;
she could manage to coax it out of him, if she chose.  then why doesnâ€™t
she choose, when i tell her of what consequence it is?  but no.  there
she sits in his company like a stone, instead of making herself agreeable
and getting it easily.  i donâ€™t know what you may call this, but i call
it unnatural conduct.â€™

there was a piece of ornamental water immediately below the parapet, on
the other side, into which mr. james harthouse had a very strong
inclination to pitch mr. thomas gradgrind junior, as the injured men of
coketown threatened to pitch their property into the atlantic.  but he
preserved his easy attitude; and nothing more solid went over the stone
balustrades than the accumulated rosebuds now floating about, a little
surface-island.

â€˜my dear tom,â€™ said harthouse, â€˜let me try to be your banker.â€™

â€˜for godâ€™s sake,â€™ replied tom, suddenly, â€˜donâ€™t talk about bankers!â€™  and
very white he looked

when tom appeared before dinner, though his mind seemed heavy enough, his
body was on the alert; and he appeared before mr. bounderby came in.  â€˜i
didnâ€™t mean to be cross, loo,â€™ he said, giving her his hand, and kissing
her.  â€˜i know you are fond of me, and you know i am fond of you.â€™

after this, there was a smile upon louisaâ€™s face that day, for some one
else.  alas, for some one else!

â€˜so much the less is the whelp the only creature that she cares for,â€™
thought james harthouse, reversing the reflection of his first dayâ€™s
knowledge of her pretty face.  â€˜so much the less, so much the less.â€™

the next morning was too bright a morning for sleep, and james harthouse
rose early, and sat in the pleasant bay window of his dressing-room,
smoking the rare tobacco that had had so wholesome an influence on his
young friend.  reposing in the sunlight, with the fragrance of his
eastern pipe about him, and the dreamy smoke vanishing into the air, so

when the devil goeth about like a roaring lion, he goeth about in a shape
by which few but savages and hunters are attracted.  but, when he is
trimmed, smoothed, and varnished, according to the mode; when he is
aweary of vice, and aweary of virtue, used up as to brimstone, and used
up as to bliss; then, whether he take to the serving out of red tape, or
to the kindling of red fire, he is the very devil.

so james harthouse reclined in the window, indolently smoking, and
reckoning up the steps he had taken on the road by which he happened to
be travelling.  the end to which it led was before him, pretty plainly;
but he troubled himself with no calculations about it.  what will be,
will be.

as he had rather a long ride to take that dayâ€”for there was a public
occasion â€˜to doâ€™ at some distance, which afforded a tolerable opportunity
of going in for the gradgrind menâ€”he dressed early and went down to

â€˜hereâ€™s tom gradgrindâ€™s daughter knows pretty well what it might have

shot when i told her!  never knew her do such a thing before.  does her
credit, under the circumstances, in my opinion!â€™

she still looked faint and pale.  james harthouse begged her to take his
arm; and as they moved on very slowly, asked her how the robbery had been
committed.

â€˜why, i am going to tell you,â€™ said bounderby, irritably giving his arm
to mrs. sparsit.  â€˜if you hadnâ€™t been so mighty particular about the sum,
i should have begun to tell you before.  you know this lady (for she _is_
a lady), mrs. sparsit?â€™

â€˜i have already had the honourâ€”â€™

bitzerâ€™s attention to him, and their both taking notice of himâ€”and to its
appearing on inquiry to-dayâ€”that he was also noticed by the neighbours?â€™
having come to the climax, mr. bounderby, like an oriental dancer, put
his tambourine on his head.

â€˜suspicious,â€™ said james harthouse, â€˜certainly.â€™

â€˜i think so, sir,â€™ said bounderby, with a defiant nod.  â€˜i think so.  but

â€˜this is not all of â€™em, even as we already know â€™em,â€™ said bounderby,
with many nods of hidden meaning.  â€˜but i have said enough for the
present.  youâ€™ll have the goodness to keep it quiet, and mention it to no
one.  it may take time, but we shall have â€™em.  itâ€™s policy to give â€™em

â€˜of course, they will be punished with the utmost rigour of the law, as

consequences, we should all go in for banks.â€™  he had gently taken
louisaâ€™s parasol from her hand, and had put it up for her; and she walked
under its shade, though the sun did not shine there.

â€˜for the present, loo bounderby,â€™ said her husband, â€˜hereâ€™s mrs. sparsit
to look after.  mrs. sparsitâ€™s nerves have been acted upon by this
business, and sheâ€™ll stay here a day or two.  so

she looked at him, as he struck the table and made the teacups ring, with
a proud colour in her face that was a new change, mr. harthouse thought.
â€˜you are incomprehensible this morning,â€™ said louisa.  â€˜pray take no
further trouble to explain yourself.  i am not curious to know your
meaning.  what does it matter?â€™

nothing more was said on this theme, and mr. harthouse was soon idly gay
on indifferent subjects.  but from this day, the sparsit action upon mr.
bounderby threw louisa and james harthouse more together, and
strengthened the dangerous alienation from her husband and confidence
against him with another, into which she had fallen by degrees so fine
that she could not retrace them if she tried.  but whether she ever tried
or no, lay hidden in her own closed heart.

mrs. sparsit was so much affected on this particular occasion, that,
assisting mr. bounderby to his hat after breakfast, and being then alone
with him in the hall, she imprinted a chaste kiss upon his hand, murmured

down, down, down, mrs. sparsitâ€™s staircase.

night and day, mrs. sparsit kept it standing.  when louisa had arrived at
the bottom and disappeared in the gulf, it might fall in upon her if it
would; but, until then, there it was to be, a building, before mrs.
sparsitâ€™s eyes.  and there louisa always was, upon it.

and always gliding down, down, down!

mrs. sparsit saw james harthouse come and go; she heard of him here and
there; she saw the changes of the face he had studied; she, too, remarked
to a nicety how and when it clouded, how and when it cleared; she kept
her black eyes wide open, with no touch of pity, with no touch of
compunction, all absorbed in interest.  in the interest of seeing her,
ever drawing, with no hand to stay her, nearer and nearer to the bottom
of this new giantâ€™s staircase.

odds and ends he wanted, and his throwing of the dust about into the eyes
of other people who wanted other odds and endsâ€”in fact resumed his
parliamentary duties.

in the meantime, mrs. sparsit kept unwinking watch and ward.  separated
from her staircase, all the week, by the length of iron road dividing
coketown from the country house, she yet maintained her cat-like
observation of louisa, through her husband, through her brother, through
james harthouse, through the outsides of letters and packets, through
everything animate and inanimate that at any time went near the stairs.

the descending figure, with the aid of her threatening mitten, â€˜and all
your art shall never blind me.â€™

rsit.  there were times when mr.
james harthouse was not sure of her.  there were times when he could not
read the face he had studied so long; and when this lonely girl was a
greater mystery to him, than any woman of the world with a ring of
satellites to help her.

so the time went on; until it happened that mr. bounderby was called away
from home by business which required his presence elsewhere, for three or
four days.  it was on a friday that he intimated this to mrs. sparsit at
the bank, adding: â€˜but youâ€™ll go down to-morrow, maâ€™a

louisa raised the hand that it might clasp her neck and join its fellow
there.  she fell upon her knees, and clinging to this strollerâ€™s child
looked up at her almost with veneration.

â€˜forgive me, pity me, help me!  have compassion on my great need, and let
me lay this head of mine upon a loving heart!â€™

â€˜o lay it here!â€™ cried sissy.  â€˜lay it here, my dear.â€™



chapter ii
very ridiculous


mr. james harthouse passed a whole night and a day in a state of so much
hurry, that the world, with its best glass in his eye, would scarcely
have recognized him during that insane interval, as the brother jem of
the honourable and jocular member.  he was positively agitated.  he
several times spoke with an emphasis, similar to the vulgar manner.  he
went in and went out in an unaccountable way, like a man without an
object.  he rode like a highwayman.  in a word, he was so horribly bored
by existing circumstance

, he must remain to confront his
fortune, whatever it was.  the hotel where he was known to live when
condemned to that region of blackness, was the stake to which he was
tied.  as to all the restâ€”what will be, will be.

â€˜so, whether i am waiting for a hostile message, or an assignation, or a
penitent remonstrance, or an impromptu wrestle with my friend bounderby
in the lancashire mannerâ€”which would seem as likely as anything else in
the present state of affairsâ€”iâ€™ll dine,â€™ said mr. james harthouse.
â€˜bounderby has the advantage in point of weight; and if anything of a
british nature is to come off between us, it may be as well to be in
training.â€™

therefore he rang the bell, and tossing himself negligently on a sofa,
ordered â€˜some dinner at sixâ€”with a beefsteak in it,â€™ and got through the
intervening time as well as he could.  that was not particularly well;
for he remained in the greatest perplexity, and, as the hours went on,
and no kind of explanation offered itself, his perp

t there is yet hope that i am not condemned to
perpetual exile from that ladyâ€™s presence.â€™

â€˜there is not the least hope.  the first object of my coming here, sir,
is to assure you that you must believe that there is no more hope of your
ever speaking with her again, than there would be if she had died when
she came home last night.â€™

â€˜must believe?  but if i canâ€™tâ€”or if i should, by infirmity of nature, be
obstinateâ€”and wonâ€™tâ€”â€™

â€˜it is still true.  there is no hope.â€™

james harthouse looked at her with an incredulous smile upon his lips;
but her mind looked over and beyond him, and the smile was quite thrown
away.

he bit his lip, and took a little time for consideration.

â€˜well!  if it should unhappily appear,â€™ he said, â€˜after due pains and
duty on my part, that i am brought to a position so desolate as this
banishment, i shall not become the ladyâ€™s persecutor.  but you said you
had no commission from her?â€™

â€˜i have only the commission of my love for her, and h

not perfectly reconcilable withâ€”in fact withâ€”the
domestic hearth; or in taking any advantage of her fatherâ€™s being a
machine, or of her brotherâ€™s being a whelp, or of her husbandâ€™s being a
bear; i beg to be allowed to assure you that i have had no particularly
evil intentions, but have glided on from one step to another with a
smoothness so perfectly diabolical, that i had not the slightest idea the

find,â€™ said mr. james harthouse, in conclusion, â€˜that it is really in
several volumes.â€™

though he said all this in his frivolous way, the way seemed, for that
once, a conscious polishing of but an ugly surface.  he was silent for a
moment; and then proceeded with a more self-possessed air, though with
traces of vexation and disappointment that would not be polished out.

â€˜after what has been just now represented to me, in a manner i find it
impossible to doubtâ€”i know of hardly any other source from which i could

at all.

â€˜i suppose a man never was placed in a more ridiculous position,â€™ he
said, after looking down, and looking up, and laughing, and frowning, and
walking off, and walking back again.  â€˜but i see no way out of it.  what
will be, will be.  _this_ will be, i suppose.  i must take off myself, i
imagineâ€”in short, i engage to do it.â€™

sissy rose.  she was not surprised by the result, but she was happy in
it, and her face beamed brightly.

â€˜you will permit me to say,â€™ continued mr. james harthouse, â€˜that i doubt
if any other ambassador, or ambassadress, could have addressed me with
the same success.  i must not only regard myself as being in a very
ridiculous position, but as being vanquished at all points.  will you
allow me the privilege of remembering my enemyâ€™s name?â€™

â€˜_my_ name?â€™ said the ambassadress.

â€˜the only name i could possibly care to know, to-night.â€™

â€˜sissy jupe.â€™

â€˜pardon my curiosity at parting.  related to the family?â€™

â€˜i am only a poor girl,â€

she was gone.

â€˜it wanted this to complete the defeat,â€™ said mr. james harthouse,
sinking, with a resigned air, on the sofa, after standing transfixed a
little while.  â€˜the defeat may now be considered perfectly accomplished.
only a poor girlâ€”only a strollerâ€”only james harthouse made nothing
ofâ€”only james harthouse a great pyramid of failure.â€™

the great pyramid put it into his head to go up the nile.  he took a pen
upon the instant, and wrote the following note (in appropriate
hieroglyphics) to his brother:

    dear jack,â€”all up at coketown.  bored out of the place, and going in
    for camels.

                                                           affectionately,
                                                                      jem.

he rang the bell.

â€˜send my fellow here.â€™

â€˜gone t

â€˜tell him to get up, and pack up.â€™

he wrote two more notes.  one, to mr. bounderby, announcing his
retirement from that part of the country, and showing where he would be
found for the next fortnight.  the other, similar in effect, to mr.
gradgrind.  almost as soon as the ink was dry upon their superscriptions,
he had left the tall chimneys of coketown behind, and was in a railway
carriage, tearing and glaring over the dark landscape.

the moral sort of fellows might suppose that mr. james harthouse derived
some comfortable reflections afterwards, from this prompt retreat, as one
of his few actions that made any amends for anything, and as a token to
himself that he had escaped the climax of a very bad business.  but it
was not so, at all.  a secret sense of having failed and been
ridiculousâ€”a dread of what other fellows who went in for similar sorts of
things, would say at his expense if they knew itâ€”so oppressed him, that
what was about the very best passage in his life was the one o

derwent so many facial contortions, that mr.
bounderby, unable to bear it, seized her by the arm and shook her.

â€˜if you canâ€™t get it out, maâ€™am,â€™ said bounderby, â€˜leave _me_ to get it
out.  this is not a time for a lady, however highly connected, to be
totally inaudible, and seemingly swallowing marbles.  tom gradgrind, mrs.
sparsit latterly found herself, by accident, in a situation to overhear a
conversation out of doors between your daughter and your precious
gentleman-friend, mr. james harthouse.â€™

â€˜indeed!â€™ said mr. gradgrind.

â€˜ah!  indeed!â€™ cried bounderby.  â€˜and in that conversationâ€”â€™

â€˜it is not necessary to repeat its tenor, bounderby.  i know what
passed.â€™

â€˜you do?  perhaps,â€™ said bounderby, staring with all his might at his so
quiet and assuasive father-in-law, â€˜you know where your daughter is at
the present time!â€™

â€˜undoubtedly.  she is here.â€™

â€˜here?â€™

â€˜my dear bounderby, let me beg you to restrain these loud out-breaks, on
all accounts.
