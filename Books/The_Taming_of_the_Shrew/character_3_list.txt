Baptista - 
                Minola
Baptista is one of the wealthiest men in Padua, and his daughters
become the prey of many suitors due to the substantial dowries he
can offer. He is good-natured, if a bit superficial. His absentmindedness increases
when Kate shows her obstinate nature. Thus, at the opening of the
play, he is already desperate to find her a suitor, having decided
that she must marry before Bianca does.
