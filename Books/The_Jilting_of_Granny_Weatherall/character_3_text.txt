 the white embroidered linen: the day started 
without fuss and the pantry shelves laid out with rows of jelly glasses and brown jugs 
and white stone-china jars with blue whirligigs and words painted on them: coffee, 
tea, sugar, ginger, cinnamon, allspice: and the bronze clock with the lion on top nicely 
dusted off. the dust that lion could collect in twenty-four hours! the box in the attic 
with all those letters tied up, well she’d have to go through that tomorrow. all those 
letters – george’s letters and john’s letters and her letters to them both – lying around 
for the children to find afterwards made her uneasy. yes, that would be tomorrow’s 
business. no use to let them know how silly she had been once. 

while she was rummaging around she found death in her mind and it felt clammy 
and unfamiliar. she had spent so much time preparing for death there was no need for

know i had my husband just the same and my children and my house like any other 
woman. a good house too and a good husband that i loved and fine children out of
