made sense to put a cookie or a lump of sugar in the
envelope when she wrote to the philosopher.
she may not always have been as smart as she would like, but who could have
guessed that the messenger was a trained dog! it was a bit out of the ordinary, to put it
mildly! she could certainly forget all about forcing the messenger to reveal alberto
knox's whereabouts.
sophie opened the big envelope and began to read.
the philosophy of athens
dear sophie, when you read this you may already have met hermes. in case you
haven't, i'll add that he is a dog. but don't worry. he is very good-tempered--and
moreover, a good deal more intelligent than a lot of people. in any event he never tries
to give the impression of being cleverer than he is.
you may also note that his name is not without significance.
in greek mythology, hermes was the messenger of the gods. he was also the god of
seafarers, but we shall not bother about that, at least not for the moment. it is more
important that hermes also gave

his name to the word "hermetic," which means
hidden or inaccessible--not inappropriate for the way hermes takes care to keep the
two of us hidden from each other.
so the messenger has herewith been introduced. naturally he answers to his name and
is altogether very well behaved. 
but to return to philosophy. we have already completed the first part of the course. i
refer to the natural philosophers and their decisive break with the mytholog-ical world
picture. now we are going to meet the three great classical philosophers, socrates,
plato, and aristotle. each in his own way, these philosophers inf

had
pointed out that everyone could understand philosophical truths if they just used their
common sense. he had also said that a slave had the same common sense as a
nobleman. sophie was sure that he would also have said that women had the same
common sense as men.
while she sat thinking, there was a sudden rustling in the hedge, and the sound of
something puffing and blowing like a steam engine. the next second, the golden 
labrador slipped into the den. it had a large envelope in its mouth.
"hermes!" cried sophie. "drop it! drop it!" the dog dropped the envelope in sophie's
lap, and sophie stretched out her hand to pat the dog's head. "good boy, hermes!" she
said. the dog lay down and allowed itself to be patted. but after a couple of minutes it
got up and began to push its way back through the hedge the same way it had come in.
sophie followed with the brown envelope in her hand. she crawled through the dense
thicket and was soon outside the garden.
hermes had already started to run towa

rd the edge of the woods, and sophie followed
a few yards behind. twice the dog turned around and growled, but sophie was not to
be deterred.
this time she was determined to find the philosopher--even if it meant running all the
way to athens.
the dog ran faster and suddenly turned off down a narrow path. sophie chased him,
but after a few minutes he turned and faced her, barking like a watchdog. sophie still
refused to give up, taking the opportunity to lessen the distance between them.
hermes turned and raced down the path. sophie realized that she would never catch
up with him. she stood quite still for what seemed like an eternity, listening to him
running farther and farther away. then all was silent.
she sat down on a tree stump by a little clearing in the woods. she still had the brown
envelope in her hand. she opened it, drew out several typewritten pages, and began to
read:
plato's academy
thank you for the pleasant time we spent together, sophie. in athens, i mean. so now

the major's cabin
... the girl in the mirror winked with both eyes...
it was only a quarter past seven. there was no need to hurry home. sophie's mother
always took it easy on sundays, so she would probably sleep for another two hours.
should she go a bit farther into the woods and try to find alberto knox? and why had
the dog snarled at her so viciously?
sophie got up and began to walk down the path hermes had taken. she had the brown
envelope with the pages on plato in her hand. wherever the path diverged she took
the wider one.
birds were chirping everywhere--in the trees and in the air, in bush and thicket. they
were busily occupied with their morning pursuits. they knew no difference between
weekdays and sundays. who had taught them to do all that? was there a tiny
computer inside each one of them, programming them to do certain things?
the path led up over a little hill, then steeply down be

 piled on a tea towel, some
of them still glistening with drops of soapy water. there was a tin bowl on the floor
with some leftover scraps of food in it. whoever lived here had a pet, a dog or a cat.
sophie went back to the living room. another door led to a tiny bedroom. on the floor
next to the bed there were a couple of blankets in a thick bundle. sophie discovered
some golden hairs on the blankets. here was the evidence! now sophie knew that the
occupants of the cabin were alberto knox and hermes.
back in the living room, sophie stood in front of the mirror. the glass was matte and
scratched, and her reflection correspondingly blurred. sophie began to make faces at
herself like she did at home in the bathroom. her reflection did exactly the same,
which was only to be expected.
but all of a sudden something scary happened. just once--in the space of a split
second--sophie saw quite clearly that the girl in the mirror winked with both eyes.
sophie started back in fright. if she herself ha

d winked--how could she have seen the
other girl wink? and not only that, it seemed as though the other girl had winked at
sophie as if to say: i can see you, sophie. i am in here, on the other side.
sophie felt her heart beating, and at the same time she heard a dog barking in the
distance. hermes! she had to get out of here at once. then she noticed a green wallet
on the chest of drawers under the mirror. it contained a hundred-crown note, a fifty, 
and a school i.d. card. it showed a picture of a girl with fair hair. under the picture
was the girl's name: hilde moller knag ...
sophie shivered. again she heard the dog bark. she had to get out, at once!
as she hurried past the table she noticed a white envelope between all the books and
the pile of paper. it had one word written on it: s

"you haven't. nothing changes. you have just developed, gotten older..."
"mm ... that was a very grownup thing to say. i just think it's all happened so very
quickly."
aristotle...a meticulous organizer who wanted to clarify our concepts ...
while her mother was taking her afternoon nap, sophie went down to the den. she
had put a lump of sugar in the pink envelope and written "to alberto" on the outside.
there was no new letter, but after a few minutes sophie heard the dog approaching.
"hermes!" she called, and the next moment he had pushed his way into the den with a
big brown envelope in his mouth.
"good boy!" sophie put her arm around the dog, which was snorting and snuffling
like a walrus. she took the pink envelope with the lump of sugar and put it in the
dog's mouth. he crawled through the hedge and made off into the woods again.
sophie opened the big envelope apprehensively, wondering whether it would contain
anything about the cabin and the boat.
it contained the usual typed

do you see, sophie? aristotle wanted to do a thorough clearing up in nature's "room."
he tried to show that everything in nature belongs to different categories and
subcategories. (hermes is a live creature, more specifically an animal, more
specifically a vertebrate, more specifically a mammal, more specifically a dog, more
specifically a labrador, more specifically a male labrador.)

so aristotle invented that game. we ought to give plato the credit for having invented
hide-and-seek. democritus has already been credited with having invented lego.
aristotle was a meticulous organizer who set out to clarify our concepts. in fact, he
founded the science of logic. he demonstrated a number of laws governing
conclusions or proofs that were valid. one example will suffice. if i first establish that
"all living creatures are mortal" (first premise), and then establish that "hermes is a 
living creature" (second premise), i can then elegantly conclude that "hermes is
mortal."
the example demonstrates that aristotle's logic was based on the correlation of terms,
in this case "living creature" and "mortal." even though one has to admit that the
above conclusion is 100% valid, we may also add that it hardly tells us anything new.
we already knew that hermes was "mortal." (he is a "dog" and all dogs are "living
creatures"--which are "mortal," unlike the rock of mount everest.

"but it doesn't make it easy for me to grade your paper. it will either be a d or an a."
"because i was either quite right or quite wrong? is that what you're saying?"
"so let's say a," said the teacher. "but next time, do your homework!"
when sophie got home from school that afternoon, she flung her schoolbag on the
steps and ran down to the den. a brown envelope lay on top of the gnarled roots. it
was quite dry around the edges, so it must have been a long time since hermes had
dropped it.
she took the envelope with her and let herself in the front door. she fed the animals
and then went upstairs to her room. lying on her bed, she opened alberto's letter and
read:

plato, and aristotle, you are now familiar with the foundations of european
philosophy. so from now on we will drop the introductory questions which you earlier

he was forgotten. but along comes hildegard. sophia appeared to her in a vision,

sophie stood up. sophia had revealed herself to hildegard in a vision ...
"maybe i will appear to hilde."
she sat down again. for the third time alberto laid his hand on her shoulder.
"that is something we must look into. but now it is past eleven o'clock. you must go
home, and we are approaching a new era. i shall summon you to a meeting on the
renaissance. hermes will come get you in the garden." 
with that the strange monk rose and began to walk toward the church. sophie stayed
where she was, thinking about hildegard and sophia, hilde and sophie. suddenly she
jumped up and ran after the monk-robed philosopher, calling:
"was there also an alberto in the middle ages?"
alberto slowed his pace somewhat, turned his head slightly and said, "aquinas had a
famous philosophy teacher called albert the great..."
with that he bowed his head and disappeared through

 mother was up before sophie on a
sunday morning. when she was, she liked to fix a solid meal for sophie.
while they were eating, mom said, "there's a strange dog in the garden. it's been
sniffing round the old hedge all morning. i can't imagine what it's doing here, can
you?"
 "yes!" sophie burst out, and at once regretted it.
"has it been here before?"
sophie had already left the table and gone into the living room to look out of the
window facing the large garden. it was just as she thought.
hermes was lying in front of the secret entrance to her den.
what should she say? she had no time to think of anything before her mother came
and stood beside her.
"did you say it had been here before?" she asked.
"i expect it buried a bone there and now it's come to fetch its treasure. dogs have
memories too ..." 
"maybe you're right, sophie. you're the animal psychologist in the family."
sophie thought feverishly.
"i'll take it home," she said.
"you know where it lives, then?"
sophie shrugged her sh

oulders.
"it's probably got an address on its collar."
a couple of minutes later sophie was on her way down the garden. when hermes
caught sight of her he came lolloping toward her, wagging his tail and jumping up to
her.
"good boy, hermes!" said sophie.
she knew her mother was watching from the window. she prayed he would not go
through the hedge. but the dog dashed toward the gravel path in front of the house,
streaked across the front yard, and jumped up to the gate.
when they had shut the gate behind them, hermes continued to run a few yards in
front of sophie. it was a long way. sophie and hermes were not the only ones out for
a sunday walk. whole families were setting off for the day. sophie felt a pang of
envy.

o time hermes would run off and sniff at another dog or at something
interesting by a garden hedge, but as soon as sophie called "here, boy!" he would
come back to her at once.
they crossed an old pasture, a large playing field, and a playground, and emerged into
an area with more traffic. they continued toward the town center along a broad street
with cobbled stones and streetcars. hermes led the way across the town square and up
church street. they came out into the old town, with its massive staid town houses
from the turn of the century. it was almost half past one. 
now they were on the other side of town. sophie had not been there very often. once
when she was little, she remembered, she had been taken to visit an old aunt in one of
these streets.
eventually they reached a little square between several old houses. it was called new
square, although it all looked very old. b

ut then the whole town was old; it had been
founded way back in the middle ages.
hermes walked toward no. 14, where he stood still and waited for sophie to open the
door. her heart began to beat faster.
inside the front door there were a number of green mailboxes attached to a panel.
sophie noticed a postcard hanging from one of the mailboxes in the top row. it had a
stamped message from the mailman across it to the effect that the addressee was
unknown.
the addressee was hilde moller knag, 14 new square. it was postmarked june 15.
that was not for two weeks, but the mailman had o

hermes was already on his way up the stairs. sophie took the postcard with her and
followed. she had to run to keep up with him; he was wagging his tail delightedly.
they passed the second, third, and fourth stories. from then on there was only an attic 
staircase. were they going up to the roof? hermes clambered on up the stairs and
stopped outside a narrow door, which he scratched at with his paw.
sophie heard footsteps approaching from inside. the door opened, and there stood

"you said once that you are not hilde's father. is that really true?"
alberto nodded.
"but am i hilde?"
"i'm tired now, sophie. you have to understand that. we have been sitting here for
over two hours, and i have been doing most of the talking. don't you have to go home
to eat?"
sophie felt almost as if he was trying to throw her out. as she went into the little hall,
she thought intensely about why he had made that slip. alberto came out after her.
hermes was lying asleep under a small row of pegs on which hung several
strange-looking garments that could have been theatrical costumes. alberto nodded
toward the dog and said, "he will come and fetch you."
"thank you for my lesson," said sophie.
she gave alberto an impulsive hug. "you're the best and kindest philosophy teacher
i've ever had," she said.
with that she opened the door to the staircase. as the door closed, alberto said, "it
won't be long before we meet again, hilde."

could hilde's father have left it there? he was a master at leaving things in the most

sophie shivered. she felt a chill run down her spine.

...such stuff as dreams are made on...
sophie heard nothing more from alberto for several days, but she glanced frequently
into the garden hoping to catch sight of hermes. she told her mother that the dog had
found its own way home and that she had been invited in by its owner, a former
physics teacher. he had told sophie about the solar system and the new science that
developed in the sixteenth century.
she told joanna more. she told her all about her visit to alberto, the postcard in the
mailbox, and the ten-crown piece she had found on the way home. she kept the dream
about hilde and the gold crucifix to herself.

"it's a very important day," sophie said, thinking not only of her birthday.
"it is, indeed."
"i feel i've grown up a lot lately."
"that's good, isn't it?"
"i don't know."
sophie had been talking with her head almost buried in her pillow. now her mother
said, "sophie--you must tell me why you seem so out of balance at the moment."
"weren't you like this when you were fifteen?"
"probably. but you know what i am talking about."
sophie suddenly turned to face her mother. "the dog's name is hermes," she said.
"it is?"
"it belongs to a man called alberto."
"i see."
"he lives down in the old town."
"you went all that way with the dog?" 
"there's nothing dangerous about that."
"you said that the dog had often been here."
"did i say that?"
she had to think now. she wanted to tell as much as possible, but she couldn't tell
everything.
"you're hardly ever at home," she ventured.
"no, i'm much too busy."
"alberto and hermes have been here lots of times."
"what for? were they in the house as wel

 don't know whether i dare ask either."
no more was said about the postcard.
"i'm going to have a garden party on midsummer eve," said sophie.
"with boys?"
sophie shrugged her shoulders. "we don't have to invite the worst idiots."
"but you are going to invite jeremy?"
"if you want. by the way, i might invite alberto knox."
"you must be crazy!"
"i know."
that was as far as the conversation got before their ways parted at the supermarket.
the first thing sophie did when she got home was to see if hermes was in the garden.
sure enough, there he was, sniffing around the apple trees.
"hermes!"
the dog stood motionless for a second. sophie knew exactly what was going on in
that second: the dog heard her call, recognized her voice, and decided to see if she 
was there. then, discovering her, he began to run toward her. finally all four legs
came pattering like drumsticks.
that was actually quite a lot in the space of one second.
he dashed up to her, wagged his tail wildly, and jumped up to lick her

 face.
"hermes, clever boy! down, down. no, stop slobbering all over me. heel, boy! that's
it!"
sophie let herself into the house. sherekan came jumping out from the bushes. he
was rather wary of the stranger. sophie put his cat food out, poured birdseed in the
budgerigars' cup, got out a salad leaf for the tortoise, and wrote a note to her mother.
she wrote that she was going to take hermes home and would be back by seven.
they set off through the town. sophie had remembered to take some money with her
this time. she wondered whether she ought to take the bus with hermes, but decided
she had better wait and ask alberto about it.
while she walked on and on behind hermes she thought about what an animal really
is.
what was the difference between a dog and a person? she recalled aristotle's words.
he said that people and animals are both natural living creatures with a lot of

like the rest of the body. it was something "spiritual." 
they were already beyond main square and were approaching the old town. when
they got to the sidewalk where sophie had found the ten crowns, she looked
automatically down at the asphalt. and there, on exactly the same spot where she had
bent down and picked up the money, lay a postcard with the picture side up. the
picture showed a garden with palms and orange trees.
sophie bent down and picked up the card. hermes started growling as if he didn't like
sophie touching it.
the card read:
dear hilde, life consists of a long chain of coincidences. it is not altogether unlikely
that the ten crowns you lost turned up right here. maybe it was found on the square in
lillesand by an old lady who was waiting for the bus to kristiansand. from
kris-tiansand she took the train to visit her grandchildren, and many, many hours later
she lost the coin here on new square. it is then perfectly possible that the very same

coin was picked up later on that day by a girl who really needed it to get home by bus.
you never can tell, hilde, but if it is truly so, then one must certainly ask whether or
not god's providence is behind everything. love, dad, who in spirit is sitting on the
dock at home in lillesand. p.s. i said i would help you find the ten crowns.
on the address side it said: "hilde moller knag, c/o a casual passer-by..." the
postmark was stamped 6/15/90.
sophie ran up the stairs after hermes. as soon as alberto opened the door, she said:
"out of my way. here comes the mailman."
she felt she had every reason to be annoyed. alberto stood aside as she barged in.
hermes laid himself down under the coat pegs as before.
"has the major presented another visiting card, my child?"
sophie looked up at him and discovered that he was wearing a different costume. he
had put on a long curled wig and a wide, baggy suit with a mass of lace. he wore a
loud silk scarf at his throat, and on top of th

"precisely. we say that descartes is a dualist, which means that he effects a sharp
division between the reality of thought and extended reality. for example, only man
has a mind. animals belong completely to extended reality. their living and moving
are accomplished me-chanically. descartes considered an animal to be a kind of
complicated automaton. as regards extended reality, he takes a thoroughly 
mechanistic view--exactly like the materialists."
"i doubt very much that hermes is a machine or an automaton. descartes couldn't
have liked animals very much. and what about us? are we automatons as well?"
"we are and we aren't. descartes came to the conclusion that man is a dual creature
that both thinks and takes up room in space. man has thus both a mind and an
extended body. st. augustine and thomas aquinas had already said something similar,
namely, that man had a body like the animals and a soul like the angels. according to
descartes, the human body is a perfect mac

as a short note attached to his door. it said:
happy birthday, hilde! now the great turning point is at hand. the moment of truth,
little one. every time i think about it, i can't stop laughing. it has naturally something 
to do with berkeley, so hold on to your hat.
sophie tore the note off the door and stuffed it into alberto's mailbox as she went out.
damn! surely he'd not gone back to athens? how could he leave her with so many
questions unanswered?
when she got home from school on june 14, hermes was romping about in the garden.
sophie ran toward him and he came prancing happily toward her. she put her arms
around him as if he were the one who could solve all the riddles.
again she left a note for her mother, but this time she put alberto's address on it.
as they made their way across town sophie thought about tomorrow. not about her
own birthday so much-- that was not going to be celebrated until midsummer eve
anyway. but tomorrow was hilde's birthday too. sophie was convinced somethin

quite extraordinary would happen. at least there would be an end to all those birthday
cards from lebanon.
when they had crossed main square and were making for the old town, they passed
by a park with a playground. hermes stopped by a bench as if he wanted sophie to sit
down.
she did, and while she patted the dog's head she looked into his eyes. suddenly the
dog started to shudder violently. he's going to bark now, thought sophie.
then his jaws began to vibrate, but hermes neither growled nor barked. he opened
his mouth and said:
"happy birthday, hilde!"
sophie was speechless. did the dog just talk to her? impossible, she must have
imagined it because she was thinking of hilde. but deep down she was nevertheless
convinced that hermes had spoken, and in a deep resonant bass voice.
the next second everything was as before. hermes gave a couple of demonstrative
barks--as if to cover up the fact that he had just spoken with a human voice-- and
trotted on ahead toward

 alberto's place. as they were going inside sophie looked up 
at the sky. it had been fine weather all day but now heavy clouds were beginning to
gather in the distance.
alberto opened the door and sophie said at once:
"no civilities, please. you are a great idiot, and you know it."
"what's the matter now?"
"the major taught hermes to talk!"
"ah, so it has come to that."
"yes, imagine!"
"and what did he say?"
 "i'll give you three guesses."
"i imagine he said something along the lines of happy birthday!"
"bingo."
alberto let sophie in. he was dressed in yet another costume. it wasn't all that
different from last time, but today there were hardly any braidings, bows, or lace.
"but that's not all," sophie said.
"what do you mean?"
"didn't you find the note in the mailbox?"
"oh, that. i threw it away at once."
"i don't care

christian god."
"yes, i suppose i did. but for us ..."
"us?"
"for us--for you and me--this 'will or spirit' that is the 'cause of everything in
everything' could be hilde's father."
sophie's eyes opened wide with incredulity. yet at the same time a realization began
to dawn on her.
"is that what you think?"
"i cannot see any other possibility. that is perhaps the only feasible explanation for
everything that has happened to us. all those postcards and signs that have turned up
here and there... hermes beginning to talk ... my own involuntary slips of the tongue."
"i..."
"imagine my calling you sophie, hilde! i knew all the time that your name wasn't
sophie."
"what are you saying? now you are definitely confused."
"yes, my mind is going round and round, my child. like a giddy planet round a
burning sun."
"and that sun is hilde's father?"
"you could say so."
"are you saying he's been a kind of god for us?" 
"to be perfectly candid, yes. he should be ashamed of himself!"
"what about hilde herse

of sound waves or of paper and writing. according to berkeley, all we can know is
that we are spirit."
 "and hilde is an angel..."
"hilde is an angel, yes. let that be the last word. happy birthday, hilde!"
suddenly the room was filled with a bluish light. a few seconds later they heard the
crash of thunder and the whole house shook.
"i have to go," said sophie. she got up and ran to the front door. as she let herself out,
hermes woke up from his nap in the hallway. she thought she heard him say, "see
you later, hilde."
sophie rushed down the stairs and ran out into the street. it was deserted. and now the
rain came down in torrents.
one or two cars were plowing through the downpour, but there were no buses in sight.
sophie ran across main square and on through the town. as she ran, one thought kept
going round and round in her mind: "tomorrow is my birthday* isn't it extra bitter to
realize that life is only a dream on

countries collaborate in
reconstructing an exact copy of the athenian square. it would be the forum for
philosophical discussion and also for disarmament talks. he felt that a giant project
like that would forge world unity. "we have, after all, succeeded in building oil rigs
and moon rockets."
then she read about plato. "the soul yearns to fly home on the wings of love to the
world of ideas. it longs to be freed from the chains of the body ..."
sophie had crawled through the hedge and followed hermes, but the dog had escaped
her. after having read about plato, she had gone farther into the woods and come
upon the red cabin by the little lake. inside hung a painting of bjerkely. from the
description it was clearly meant to be hilde's bjerkely. but there was also a portrait of
a man named berkeley. "how odd!"
hilde laid the heavy ring binder aside on the bed and went over to her bookshelf and
looked him up in the three-volume encyclopedia she had been given on her fourteenth
birthday. here he

and looked up at her mother.
"i forgot the time, mom. i'm sorry, but i'm reading something terribly exciting."
her mother could not help smiling.
"it's a magic book," added hilde.
"okay. happy birthday once again, hilde!" 
"hey, i don't know if i can take that phrase any more."
"but i haven't... i'm just going to rest for a while, then i'll start fixing a great dinner. i
managed to get hold of some strawberries."
"okay, i'll go on reading."
her mother left and hilde read on.
sophie is following hermes through the town. in alberto's hall she finds another card
from lebanon. this, too, is dated june 15.
hilde was just beginning to understand the system of the dates. the cards dated
before june 15 are copies of cards hilde had already received from her dad. but those

i will make a philosophical speech."
this was greeted by a burst of applause.
"in this riotous company, a dose of reason might not be out of place. but whatever
happens, let us not forget to congratulate sophie on her fifteenth birthday."
he had hardly finished these sentences when they heard the drone of an approaching
sports plane. it flew in low over the garden. behind it streamed a
