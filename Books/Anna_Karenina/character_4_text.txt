afterwards."

"well, say the few words, then, at once, and we’ll gossip after dinner."

"well, it’s this," said levin; "but it’s of no importance, though."

his face all at once took an expression of anger from the effort he was
making to surmount his shyness.

"what are the shtcherbatskys doing? everything as it used to be?" he
said.

stepan arkadyevitch, who had long known that levin was in love with his
sister-in-law, kitty, gave a hardly perceptible smile, and his eyes
sparkled merrily.

"you said a few words, but i can’t answer in a few words, because....
excuse me a minute..."

a secretary came in, with respectful familiarity and the modest
consciousness, characteristic of every secretary, of superiority to his
chief in the knowledge of their business; he went up to oblonsky with
some papers, and began, under pretense of asking a question, to explain
some objection. stepan arkadyevitch, without hearing him ou

"oh, why so?" levin queried, panic-stricken.

"oh, nothing," responded oblonsky. "we’ll talk it over. but what’s
brought you up to town?"

"oh, we’ll talk about that, too, later on," said levin, reddening again
up to his ears.

"all right. i see," said stepan arkadyevitch. "i should ask you to come
to us, you know, but my wife’s not quite the thing. but i tell you what;
if you want to see them, they’re sure now to be at the zoological
gardens from four to five. kitty skates. you drive along there, and i’ll
come and fetch you, and we’ll go and dine somewhere together."

"capital. so good-bye till then."

"now mind, you’ll forget, i know you, or rush off home to the country!"
stepan arkadyevitch called out laughing.

"no, truly!"

and levin went out of the room, only when he was in the doorway
remembering that he had forgotten to take leave of oblonsky’s
colleagues.

"that gentleman must be a man of great energy," said grinevitch, when
levin had gone

ught him to town, levin blushed,
and was furious with himself for blushing, because he could not answer,
"i have come to make your sister-in-law an offer," though that was
precisely what he had come for.

the families of the levins and the shtcherbatskys were old, noble moscow
families, and had always been on intimate and friendly terms. this
intimacy had grown still closer during levin’s student days. he had both
prepared for the university with the young prince shtcherbatsky, the
brother of kitty and dolly, and had entered at the same time with him.
in those days levin used often to be in the shtcherbatskys’ house, and
he was in love with the shtcherbatsky household. strange as it may
appear, it was with the household, the family, that konstantin levin was
in love, especially with the feminine half of the household. levin did
not remember his own mother, and his only sister was older than he was,
so that it was in the shtcherbatskys’ house that he saw for the first
time that inner l

was that at certain hours they played by turns on the piano, the sounds
of which were audible in their brother’s room above, where the students
used to work; why they were visited by those professors of french
literature, of music, of drawing, of dancing; why at certain hours all
the three young ladies, with mademoiselle linon, drove in the coach to
the tversky boulevard, dressed in their satin cloaks, dolly in a long
one, natalia in a half-long one, and kitty in one so short that her
shapely legs in tightly-drawn red stockings were visible to all
beholders; why it was they had to walk about the tversky boulevard
escorted by a footman with a gold cockade in his hat—all this and much
more that was done in their mysterious world he did not understand, but
he was sure that everything that was done there was very good, and he
was in love precisely with the mystery of the proceedings.

but she was soon married to oblonsky. then he began being in love with
the second. he felt, as it were, that he had to be in love with one of
the sisters, only he could not quite make out which. but natalia, too,
had hardly made her appearance in the world when she married the
diplomat lvov. kitty was still a child when levin left the university.
young shtcherbatsky went into the navy, was drowned in the baltic, and
levin’s relations with the shtcherbatskys, in spite of his friendship
with oblonsky, became less intimate. but when early in the winter of
this year levin came to moscow, after a year in the country, and saw the
shtcherbatskys, he realized which of the three sisters he was indeed
destined to love.

one would have thought that nothing could be simpler than for him, a man

good family, rather rich than poor, and thirty-two years old, to make
the young princess shtcherbatskaya an offer of marriage; in all
likelihood he would at once have been looked upon as a good match. but
levin was in love, and so it seemed to him that kitty was so perfect in
every respect that she was a creature far above everything earthly; and
that he was a creature so low and so earthly that it could not even be
conceived that other people and she herself could regard him as worthy
of her.

after spending two months in moscow in a state of enchantment, seeing
kitty almost every day in society, into which he went so as to meet her,
he abruptly decided that it could not be, and went back to the country.

levin’s conviction that it could not be

was founded on the idea that in
the eyes of her family he was a disadvantageous and worthless match for
the charming kitty, and that kitty herself could not love him. in her
family’s eyes he had no ordinary, definite career and position in
society, while his contemporaries by this time, when he was thirty-two,
were already, one a colonel, and another a professor, another director
of a bank and railways, or president of a board like oblonsky. but he
(he knew very well how he must appear to others) was a country
gentleman, occupied in breeding cattle, shooting game, and building
barns; in other words, a fellow of no ability, who h

well, and who was doing just what, according to the ideas of the world,
is done by people fit for nothing else.

the mysterious, enchanting kitty herself could not love such an ugly
person as he conceived himself to be, and, above all, such an ordinary,
in no way striking person. moreover, his attitude to kitty in the
past—the attitude of a grown-up person to a child, arising from his
friendship with her brother—seemed to him yet another obstacle to love.
an ugly, good-natured man, as he considered himself, might, he supposed,
be liked as a friend; but to be loved with such a love as that with
which he loved kitty, one would need to be a handsome and, still more, a
distinguished man.

he had heard that women often did care for ugly and ordinary men, but he
did not believe it, for he judged by hims

ful, awful!" repeated levin.

after obtaining his brother’s address from sergey ivanovitch’s footman,
levin was on the point of setting off at once to see him, but on second
thought he decided to put off his visit till the evening. the first
thing to do to set his heart at rest was to accomplish what he had come
to moscow for. from his brother’s levin went to oblonsky’s office, and
on getting news of the shtcherbatskys from him, he drove to the place
where he had been told he might find kitty.



chapter 9


at four o’clock, conscious of his throbbing heart, levin stepped out of
a hired sledge at the zoological gardens, and turned along the path to
the frozen mounds and the skating ground, knowing that he would
certainly find her there, as he had seen the shtcherbatskys’ carriage at
the entrance.

it was a bright, frosty day. rows of carriages, sledges, drivers, and
policemen were standing in the approach. crowds of well-dressed people,
with hats bright in the sun, swarmed about

et on the ice. there were crack
skaters there, showing off their skill, and learners clinging to chairs
with timid, awkward movements, boys, and elderly people skating with
hygienic motives. they seemed to levin an elect band of blissful beings
because they were here, near her. all the skaters, it seemed, with
perfect self-possession, skated towards her, skated by her, even spoke
to her, and were happy, quite apart from her, enjoying the capital ice
and the fine weather.

nikolay shtcherbatsky, kitty’s cousin, in a short jacket and tight
trousers, was sitting on a garden seat with his skates on. seeing levin,
he shouted to him:

"ah, the first skater in russia! been here long? first-rate ice—do put
your skates on."

"i haven’t got my skates," levin answered, marveling at this boldness
and ease in her presence, and not for one second losing sight of her,
though he did not look at her. he felt as though the sun were coming
near him. she was in a corner, and turning out her slender feet

hy so?.... no, i have nothing to trouble me," she responded
coldly; and she added immediately: "you haven’t seen mlle. linon, have
you?"

"not yet."

"go and speak to her, she likes you so much."

"what’s wrong? i have offended her. lord help me!" thought levin, and he
flew towards the old frenchwoman with the gray ringlets, who was sitting
on a bench. smiling and showing her false teeth, she greeted him as an
old friend.

"yes, you see we’re growing up," she said to him, glancing towards
kitty, "and growing old. _tiny bear_ has grown big now!" pursued the
frenchwoman, laughing, and she reminded him of his joke about the three
young ladies whom he had compared to the three bears in the english
nursery tale. "do you remember that’s what you used to call them?"

he remembered absolutely nothing, but she had been laughing at the joke
for ten years now, and was fond of it.

"now, go and skate, go and skate. our kitty has learned to skate nicely,
hasn’t she?"

when levin darted up to k

 certain note of deliberate
composure. and he felt depressed. after talking a little of her old
governess and her peculiarities, she questioned him about his life.

"surely you must be dull in the country in the winter, aren’t you?" she
said.

"no, i’m not dull, i am very busy," he said, feeling that she was
holding him in check by her composed tone, which he would not have the
force to break through, just as it had been at the beginning of the
winter.

"are you going to stay in town long?" kitty questioned him.

"i don’t know," he answered, not thinking of what he was saying. the
thought that if he were held in check by her tone of quiet friendliness
he would end by going back again without deciding anything came into his
mind, and he resolved to make a struggle against it.

"how is it you don’t know?"

"i don’t know. it depends upon you," he said, and was immediately
horror-stricken at his own words.

whether it was that she had heard his words, or that she did not want to

that’s a new trick!" said levin, and he promptly ran up to the top
to do this new trick.

"don’t break your neck! it needs practice!" nikolay shtcherbatsky
shouted after him.

levin went to the steps, took a run from above as best he could, and
dashed down, preserving his balance in this unwonted movement with his
hands. on the last step he stumbled, but barely touching the ice with
his hand, with a violent effort recovered himself, and skated off,
laughing.

"how splendid, how nice he is!" kitty was thinking at that time, as she
came out of the pavilion with mlle. linon, and looked towards him with a
smile of quiet affection, as though he were a favorite brother. "and can
it be my fault, can i have done anything wrong? they talk of flirtation.
i know it’s not he that i love; but still i am happy with him, and he’s
so jolly. only, why did he say that?..." she mused.

catching sight of kitty going away, and her mother meeting her at the
steps, levin, flushed from his rapid exercise,

stood still and pondered
a minute. he took off his skates, and overtook the mother and daughter
at the entrance of the gardens.

"delighted to see you," said princess shtcherbatskaya. "on thursdays we
are home, as always."

"today, then?"

"we shall be pleased to see you," the princess said stiffly.

this stiffness hurt kitty, and she could not resist the desire to smooth
over her mother’s coldness. she turned her head, and with a smile said:

"good-bye till this evening."

at that moment stepan arkadyevitch, his hat cocked on one side, with
beaming face and eyes, strode into the garden like a conquering hero.
but as he approached his mother-in-law, he responded in a mournful and
crestfallen tone to her inquiries about dolly’s health. after a little
subdued and dejected conversation with his mother-in-law, he th

und of that voice saying, "good-bye till this evening," and seeing the
smile with which it was said.

"to the england or the hermitage?"

"i don’t mind which."

"all right, then, the england," said stepan arkadyevitch, selecting that
restaurant because he owed more there than at the hermitage, and
consequently considered it mean to avoid it. "have you got a sledge?
that’s first-rate, for i sent my carriage home."

the friends hardly spoke all the way. levin was wondering what that
change in kitty’s expression had meant, and alternately assuring himself
that there was hope, and falling into despair, seeing clearly that his
hopes were insane, and yet all the while he felt himself quite another
man, utterly unlike what he had been before her smile and those words,
"good-bye till this evening."

stepan arkadyevitch was absorbed during the drive in composing the menu
of the dinner.

"you like turbot, don’t you?" he said to levin as they were arriving.

"eh?" responded levin. "turbot? yes

of fish and vodka, and said to the painted frenchwoman decked in
ribbons, lace, and ringlets, behind the counter, something so amusing
that even that frenchwoman was moved to genuine laughter. levin for his
part refrained from taking any vodka simply because he felt such a
loathing of that frenchwoman, all made up, it seemed, of false hair,
_poudre de riz,_ and _vinaigre de toilette_. he made haste to move away
from her, as from a dirty place. his whole soul was filled with memories
of kitty, and there was a smile of triumph and happiness shining in his
eyes.

"this way, your excellency, please. your excellency won’t be disturbed
here," said a particularly pertinacious, white-headed old tatar with
immense hips and coat-tails gaping widely behind. "walk in, your
excellency," he said to levin; by way of showing his respect to stepan
arkadyevitch, being attentive to his guest as well.

remembering his position with his wife, and, after a moment’s silence,
resumed—"she has a gift of foreseeing things. she sees right through
people; but that’s not all; she knows what will come to pass, especially
in the way of marriages. she foretold, for instance, that princess
shahovskaya would marry brenteln. no one would believe it, but it came
to pass. and she’s on your side."

"how do you mean?"

"it’s not only that she likes you—she says that kitty is certain to be
your wife."

at these words levin’s face suddenly lighted up with a smile, a smile
not far from tears of emotion.

"she says that!" cried levin. "i always said she was exquisite, your
wife. there, that’s enough, enough said about it," he said, getting up
from his seat.

"all right, but do sit down."

but levin could not sit down. he walked with his firm tread twice up and
down the little cage of a room, blinked his eyelids that his tears might
not fall, and only then sat do

there for the levy of recruits. fearfully rich, handsome, great
connections, an aide-de-camp, and with all that a very nice,

i’ve found out here—he’s a cultivated man, too, and very intelligent;
he’s a man who’ll make his mark."

levin scowled and was dumb.

"well, he turned up here soon after you’d gone, and as i can see, he’s
over head and ears in love with kitty, and you know that her mother..."

"excuse me, but i know nothing," said levin, frowning gloomily. and
immediately he recollected his brother nikolay and how hateful he was to
have been able to forget him.

"you wait a bit, wait a bit," said stepan arkadyevitch, smiling and
touching his hand. "i’ve told you what i know, and i repeat that in this
delicate and tender matter, as far as one can conjecture, i believe the
chances are in your favor."

levin dropped back in his chair; his face was pa

sense of relaxation
and relief after the conversation with levin, which always put him to
too great a mental and spiritual strain.

when the tatar appeared with a bill for twenty-six roubles and odd
kopecks, besides a tip for himself, levin, who would another time have
been horrified, like any one from the country, at his share of fourteen
roubles, did not notice it, paid, and set off homewards to dress and go
to the shtcherbatskys’ there to decide his fate.



chapter 12


the young princess kitty shtcherbatskaya was eighteen. it was the first
winter that she had been out in the world. her success in society had
been greater than that of either of her elder sisters, and greater even
than her mother had anticipated. to say nothing of the young men who
danced at the moscow balls being almost all in love with kitty, two
serious suitors had already this first winter made their appearance:
levin, and immediately after his departure, count vronsky.

levin’s appearance at the beginning of the
 
 ___________________________
 
 winter, his frequent visits,
and evident love for kitty, had led to the first serious conversations
between kitty’s parents as to her future, and to disputes between them.
the prince was on levin’s side; he said he wished for nothing better for
kitty. the princess for her part, going round the question in the manner
peculiar to women, maintained that kitty was too young, that levin had
done nothing to prove that he had serious intentions, that kitty felt no
great attraction to him, and other side issues; but she did not state
the principal point, which was that she looked for a better match for
her daughter, and that levin was not to her liking, and she did not
understand him. when levin had abruptly departed, the princess was
delighted, and said to her husband triumphantly: "you see i was right."
when vronsky appeared on the scene, she was still more delighted,
confirmed in her opinion that kitty was to make not simply a good, but a
brill
 
 ___________________________
 
 she did not very much like it that he, who was in love with
her daughter, had kept coming to the house for six weeks, as though he
were waiting for something, inspecting, as though he were afraid he
might be doing them too great an honor by making an offer, and did not
realize that a man, who continually visits at a house where there is a
young unmarried girl, is bound to make his intentions clear. and
suddenly, without doing so, he disappeared. "it’s as well he’s not
attractive enough for kitty to have fallen in love with him," thought
the mother.

vronsky satisfied all the mother’s desires. very wealthy, clever, of
aristocratic family, on the highroad to a brilliant career in the army
and at court, and a fascinating man. nothing better could be wished for.

vronsky openly flirted with kitty at balls, danced with her, and came
continually to the house, consequently there could be no doubt of the
seriousness of his intentions. but, in spite of that, the mother had
spent the whole of

ed over, the money that had been wasted, and
the disputes with her husband over marrying the two elder girls, darya
and natalia! now, since the youngest had come out, she was going through
the same terrors, the same doubts, and still more violent quarrels with
her husband than she had over the elder girls. the old prince, like all
fathers indeed, was exceedingly punctilious on the score of the honor
and reputation of his daughters. he was irrationally jealous over his
daughters, especially over kitty, who was his favorite. at every turn he
had scenes with the princess for compromising her daughter. the princess
had grown accustomed to this already with her other daughters, but now
she felt that there was more ground for the prince’s touchiness. she saw
that of late years much was changed in the manners of society, that a
mother’s duties had become still more difficult. she saw that girls of
kitty’s age formed some sort of clubs, went to some sort of lectures,
mixed freely in men’s s

ther, her daughter might fall in love, and fall in
love with someone who did not care to marry her or who was quite unfit
to be her husband. and, however much it was instilled into the princess
that in our times young people ought to arrange their lives for
themselves, she was unable to believe it, just as she would have been
unable to believe that, at any time whatever, the most suitable
playthings for children five years old ought to be loaded pistols. and
so the princess was more uneasy over kitty than she had been over her
elder sisters.

now she was afraid that vronsky might confine himself to simply flirting
with her daughter. she saw that her daughter was in love with him, but
tried to comfort herself with the thought that he was an honorable man,
and would not do this. but at the same time she knew how easy it is,
with the freedom of manners of today, to turn a girl’s head, and how
lightly men generally regard such a crime. the week before, kitty had
told her mother of a conversat

ion she had with vronsky during a mazurka.
this conversation had partly reassured the princess; but perfectly at
ease she could not be. vronsky had told kitty that both he and his
brother were so used to obeying their mother that they never made up
their minds to any important undertaking without consulting her. "and
just now, i am impatiently awaiting my mother’s arrival from petersburg,
as peculiarly fortunate," he told her.

kitty had repeated this without attaching any significance to the words.
but her mother saw them in a different light. she knew that the old lady
was expected from day to day, that she would be pleased at her son’s
choice, and she felt it strange that he should not make his offer
through fear of vexing his mother. however, she was so anxious for the
marriage itself, and still more for relief from her fears, that she
believed it was so. bitter as it was for the princess to see the
unhappiness of her
 
 ___________________________
 
 reappearance, a fresh
source of anxiety arose. she was afraid that her daughter, who had at
one time, as she fancied, a feeling for levin, might, from extreme sense
of honor, refuse vronsky, and that levin’s arrival might generally
complicate and delay the affair so near being concluded.

"why, has he been here long?" the princess asked about levin, as they
returned home.

"he came today, mamma."

"there’s one thing i want to say..." began the princess, and from her
serious and alert face, kitty guessed what it would be.

"mamma," she said, flushing hotly and turning quickly to her, "please,
please don’t say anything about that. i know, i know all about it."

she wished for what her mother wished for, but the motives of her
mother’s wishes wounded her.

"i only want to say that to raise hopes..."

"mamma, darling, for goodness’ sake, don’t talk about it. it’s so
horrible to talk about it."

"i won’t," said her mother, seeing the tears in her daughter’s eyes;
"but one thin

g, my love; you promised me you would have no secrets from
me. you won’t?"

"never, mamma, none," answered kitty, flushing a little, and looking her
mother straight in the face, "but there’s no use in my telling you
anything, and i ... i ... if i wanted to, i don’t know what to say or
how ... i don’t know..."

"no, she could not tell an untruth with those eyes," thought the mother,
smiling at her agitation and happiness. the princess smiled that what
was taking place just now in her soul seemed to the poor child so
immense and so important.



chapter 13


after dinner, and till the beginning of the
 
 ___________________________
 
 evening, kitty was feeling a
sensation akin to the sensation of a young man before a battle. her
heart throbbed violently, and her thoughts would not rest on anything.

she felt that this evening, when they would both meet for the first
time, would be a turning point in her life. and she was continually
picturing them to herself, at one moment each separately, and then both
together. when she mused on the past, she dwelt with pleasure, with
tenderness, on the memories of her relations with levin. the memories

ress, and looked into the looking-glass, she
noticed with joy that it was one of her good days, and that she was in
complete possession of all her forces,—she needed this so for what lay
before her: she was conscious of external composure and free grace in
her movements.

at half-past seven she had only just gone down into the drawing room,
when the footman announced, "konstantin dmitrievitch levin." the
princess was still in her room, and the prince had not come in. "so it
is to be," thought kitty, and all the blood seemed to rush to her heart.
she was horrified at her paleness, as she glanced into the
looking-glass. at that moment she knew beyond doubt that he had come
early on purpose to find her alone and to make her an offer. and only
then for the first time the whole thing presented itself in a new,
different aspect; only then she realized that the question did not
affect her only—with whom she would be happy, and whom she loved—but
that she would have that moment to wound a man

his shining eyes fixed on her. she looked straight into his face, as
though imploring him to spare her, and gave her hand.

"it’s not time yet; i think i’m too early," he said glancing round the
empty drawing room. when he saw that his expectations were realized,
that there was nothing to prevent him from speaking, his face became
gloomy.

"oh, no," said kitty, and sat down at the table.

"but this was just what i wanted, to find you alone," he began, not
sitting down, and not looking at her, so as not to lose courage.

"mamma will be down directly. she was very much tired.... yesterday..."

she talked on, not knowing what her lips were uttering, and not taking
her supplicating and caressing eyes off him.

he glanced at her; she blushed, and ceased speaking.

"i told you i did not know whether i should be here long ... that it
depended on you..."

a moment ago, and how close she had been to him, of what importance in
his life! and how aloof and remote from him she had become now!

"it was bound to be so," he said, not looking at her.

he bowed, and was meaning to retreat.



chapter 14


but at that very moment the princess came in. there was a look of horror
on her face when she saw them alone, and their disturbed faces. levin
bowed to her, and said nothing. kitty did not speak nor lift her eyes.
"thank god, she has refused him," thought the mother, and her face
lighted up with the habitual smile with which she greeted her guests on
thursdays. she sat down and began questioning levin about his life in
the country. he sat down again, waiting for other visitors to arrive, in
order to retreat unnoticed.

five minutes later there came in a friend of kitty’s, married the
preceding winter, countess nordston.

she was a thin, sallow, sickly, and nervous woman

, with brilliant black
eyes. she was fond of kitty, and her affection for her showed itself, as
the affection of married women for girls always does, in the desire to
make a match for kitty after her own ideal of married happiness; she
wanted her to marry vronsky. levin she had often met at the
shtcherbatskys’ early in the winter, and she had always disliked him.
her invariable and favorite pursuit, when they met, consisted in making
fun of him.

"i do like it when he looks down at me from the height of his grandeur,
or breaks off his learned conversation with me because i’m a fool, or is
condescending to me. i like that so; to see him condescending! i am so
glad he can’t be

friendly terms, despise each other to such a degree that they cannot
even take each other seriously, and cannot even be offended by each
other.

the countess nordston pounced upon levin at once.

"ah, konstantin dmitrievitch! so you’ve come back to our corrupt
babylon," she said, giving him her tiny, yellow hand, and recalling what
he had chanced to say early in the winter, that moscow was a babylon.
"come, is babylon reformed, or have you degenerated?" she added,
glancing with a simper at kitty.

"it’s very flattering for me, countess, that you remember my words so
well," responded levin, who had succeeded in recovering his composure,
and at once from habit dropped into his tone of joking hostility to the
countess nordston. "they must certainly make a great impression on you."

"oh, i should think so! i always note them all down. well, kitty, have
you been skating again?..."

and she began talking to kitty. awkward as it was for levin to withdraw
now, it would still have been easier
 
 ___________________________
 
 for him to perpetrate this
awkwardness than to remain all the evening and see kitty, who glanced at
him now and then and avoided his eyes. he was on the point of getting
up, when the princess, noticing that he was silent, addressed him.

"shall you be long in moscow? you’re busy with the district council,
though, aren’t you, and can’t be away for long?"

"no, princess, i’m no longer a member of the council," he said. "i have
come up for a few days."

"there’s something the matter with him," thought countess nordston,
glancing at his stern, serious face. "he isn’t i

mood. but i’ll draw him out. i do love making a fool of him before
kitty, and i’ll do it."

"konstantin dmitrievitch," she said to him, "do explain to me, please,
what’s the meaning of it. you know all about such things. at home in our
village of kaluga all the peasants and all the women have drunk up all
they possessed, and now they can’t pay us any rent. what’s the meaning
of that? you always praise the peasants so."

at that instant another lady came into the room, and levin got up.

"excuse me, countess, but i really know nothing about it, and can’t te

you anything," he said, and looked round at the officer who came in
behind the lady.

"that must be vronsky," thought levin, and, to be sure of it, glanced at
kitty. she had already had time to look at vronsky, and looked round at
levin. and simply from the look in her eyes, that grew unconsciously
brighter, levin knew that she loved that man, knew it as surely as if
she had told him so in words. but what sort of a man was he? now,
whether for good or for ill, levin could not choose but remain; he must
find out what the man was like whom she loved.

 no difficulty in
finding what was good and attractive in vronsky. it was apparent at the
first glance. vronsky was a squarely built, dark man, not very tall,
with a good-humored, handsome, and exceedingly calm and resolute face.
everything about his face and figure, from his short-cropped black hair
and freshly shaven chin down to his loosely fitting, brand-new uniform,
was simple and at the same time elegant. making way for the lady who had
come in, vronsky went up to the princess and then to kitty.

as he approached her, his beautiful eyes shone with a specially tender
light, and with a faint, happy, and modestly triumphant smile (so it
seemed to levin), bowing carefully and respectfully over her, he held
out his small broad hand to her.

greeting and saying a few words to everyone, he sat down without once
glancing at levin, who had never taken his eyes off him.

"let me introduce you," said the princess, indicating levin. "konstantin

"i don’t know; i have never tried for long. i experienced a queer
feeling once," he went on. "i never longed so for the country, russian
country, with bast shoes and peasants, as when i was spending a winter
with my mother in nice. nice itself is dull enough, you know. and
indeed, naples and sorrento are only pleasant for a short time. and it’s
just there that russia comes back to me most vividly, and especially the
country. it’s as though..."

he talked on, addressing both kitty and levin, turning his serene,
friendly eyes from one to the other, and saying obviously just what came
into his head.

noticing that countess nordston wanted to say something, he stopped
short without finishing what he had begun, and listened attentively to
her.

the conversation did not flag for an instant, so that the princess, who
always kept in reserve, in case a subject should be lacking, two heavy
guns—the relative advantages of classical and of modern education, and
universal military

"oh, then you don’t believe in it?"

"i can’t believe in it, countess."

"but if i’ve seen it myself?"

"the peasant women too tell us they have seen goblins."

"then you think i tell a lie?"

and she laughed a mirthless laugh.

"oh, no, masha, konstantin dmitrievitch said he could not believe in
it," said kitty, blushing for levin, and levin saw this, and, still more
exasperated, would have answered, but vronsky with his bright frank
smile rushed to the support of the conversation, which was threatening
to become disagreeable.

"you do not admit the conceivability at all?" he queried. "but why not?
we admit the existence of electricity, of which we know nothing. why
should there not be some new force, still unknown to us, which..."

"when electricity was discovered," levin interrupted hurriedly, "it w

they boldly talk of spiritual force, and then try to subject it to
material experiment."

every one was waiting for him to finish, and he felt it.

"and i think you would be a first-rate medium," said countess nordston;
"there’s something enthusiastic in you."

levin opened his mouth, was about to say something, reddened, and said
nothing.

"do let us try table-turning at once, please," said vronsky. "princess,
will you allow it?"

and vronsky stood up, looking for a little table.

kitty got up to fetch a table, and as she passed, her eyes met levin’s.
she felt for him with her whole heart, the more because she was pitying
him for suffering of which she was herself the cause. "if you can
forgive me, forgive me," said her eyes, "i am so happy."

"i hate them all, and you, and myself," his eyes responded, and he took
up his hat. but he was not destined to escape. just as they were
arranging themselves round the table, and levin was on the point of
retiring, the old prince came 
 
 ___________________________
 
in, and after greeting the ladies,
addressed levin.

"ah!" he began joyously. "been here long, my boy? i didn’t even know you
were in town. very glad to see you." the old prince embraced levin, and
talking to him did not observe vronsky, who had risen, and was serenely
waiting till the prince should turn to him.

kitty felt how distasteful her father’s warmth was to levin after what
had happened. she saw, too, how coldly her father responded at last to
vronsky’s bow, and how vronsky looked with amiable perplexity at her
father, as though trying and failing to understand how and why anyone
could be hostilely disposed towards him, and she flushed.

"prince, let us have konstantin dmitrievitch," said countess nordston;
"we want to try an experiment."

"what experiment? table-turning? well, you must excuse me

, ladies and
gentlemen, but to my mind it is better fun to play the ring game," said
the old prince, looking at vronsky, and guessing that it had been his
suggestion. "there’s some sense in that, anyway."

vronsky looked wonderingly at the prince with his resolute eyes, and,
with a faint smile, began immediately talking to countess nordston of
the great ball that was to come off next week.

"i hope you will be there?" he said to kitty. as soon as the old prince
turned away from him, levin went out unnoticed, and the last impression
he carried away with him of that evening was the smiling, happy face of
kitty answering vronsky’s inquiry about the ball.



chapter 15


at the end of the evening kitty told her mother of her conversation with
levin, and in spite of all the pity she felt for levin, she was glad at
the thought that she had received an _offer_. she had no doubt that she
had acted rightly. but after she had gone t

ince, waving his arms, and at
once wrapping his squirrel-lined dressing-gown round him again. "that
you’ve no pride, no dignity; that you’re disgracing, ruining your
daughter by this vulgar, stupid match-making!"

"but, really, for mercy’s sake, prince, what have i done?" said the
princess, almost crying.

she, pleased and happy after her conversation with her daughter, had
gone to the prince to say good-night as usual, and though she had no
intention of telling him of levin’s offer and kitty’s refusal, still she
hinted to her husband that she fancied things were practically settled
with vronsky, and that he would declare himself so soon as his mother
arrived. and thereupon, at those words, the prince had all at once flown
into a passion, and began to use unseemly language.

"what have you done? i’ll tell you what. first of all, you’re trying to
catch an eligible gentleman, and all moscow will be talking of it, and
with good reason. if you have evening parties, invite everyone

wait a minute. do i try and catch them? i don’t try to catch
them in the least. a young man, and a very nice one, has fallen in love
with her, and she, i fancy..."

"oh, yes, you fancy! and how if she really is in love, and he’s no more
thinking of marriage than i am!... oh, that i should live to see it! ah!
spiritualism! ah! nice! ah! the ball!" and the prince, imagining that he
was mimicking his wife, made a mincing curtsey at each word. "and this
is how we’re preparing wretchedness for kitty; and she’s really got the
notion into her head..."

"but what makes you suppose so?"

"i don’t suppose; i know. we have eyes for such things, though
women-folk haven’t. i see a man who has serious intentions, that’s
levin: and i see a peacock, like this feather-head, who’s only amusing
himself."

"oh, well, when once you get an idea into your head!..."

"well, you’ll remember my words, but too late, just as with dolly."

"well, well, we won’t talk of it," the princess stopped him,
 
 ___________________________
 

recollecting her unlucky dolly.

"by all means, and good night!"

and signing each other with the cross, the husband and wife parted with
a kiss, feeling that they each remained of their own opinion.

the princess had at first been quite certain that that evening had
settled kitty’s future, and that there could be no doubt of vronsky’s
intentions, but her husband’s words had disturbed her. and returning to
her own room, in terror before the unknown future, she, too, like kitty,
repeated several times in her heart, "lord, have pity; lord, have pity;
lord, have pity."



chapter 16


vronsky had never had a real home life. his mother had been in her youth
a brilliant society woman, who had had during her married life, and
still more afterwards, many love affairs notorious in the whole
fashionable world. his father he scarcely remembered, and he had been
educated in the corps of pages.

leaving the school very young as a brilliant officer, he had at once got
into the ci

rcle of wealthy petersburg army men. although he did go more
or less into petersburg society, his love affairs had always hitherto
been outside it.

in moscow he had for the first time felt, after his luxurious and coarse
life at petersburg, all the charm of intimacy with a sweet and innocent
girl of his own rank, who cared for him. it never even entered his head
that there could be any harm in his relations with kitty. at balls he
danced principally with her. he was a constant visitor at their house.
he talked to her as people commonly do talk in society—all sorts of
nonsense, but nonsense to which he could not help attaching a special
meaning in her case. although he said nothing to her that he could not
have said before everybody, he felt that she was becoming more and more
dependent upon him, and the more he felt this, the better he liked it,
and the tenderer was his feeling for her. he did not know tha

t his mode
of behavior in relation to kitty had a definite character, that it is
courting young girls with no intention of marriage, and that such
courting is one of the evil actions common among brilliant young men
such as he was. it seemed to him that he was the first who had
discovered this pleasure, and he was enjoying his discovery.

if he could have heard what her parents were saying that evening, if he
could have put himself at the point of view of the family and have heard
that kitty would be unhappy if he did not marry her, he would have been
greatly astonished, and would not have believed it. he could not believe
that what gave such great and delicate pleasure to him, and above all to
her, could be wrong. still less could he have believed that he ought to
marry.

marriage had never presented itself to him as a possibility. he not only
disliked family life, but a family, and especially a husband was, in
accordance with the views general in the bachelor world in which he

ridiculous.

but though vronsky had not the least suspicion what the parents were
saying, he felt on coming away from the shtcherbatskys’ that the secret
spiritual bond which existed between him and kitty had grown so much
stronger that evening that some step must be taken. but what step could
and ought to be taken he could not imagine.

"what is so exquisite," he thought, as he returned from the
shtcherbatskys’, carrying away with him, as he always did, a delicious
feeling of purity and freshness, arising partly from the fact that he
had not been smoking for a whole evening, and with it a new feeling of
tenderness at her love for him—"what is so exquisite is that not a word

"yes, he’s a very remarkable man; rather a conservative, but a splendid
man," observed stepan arkadyevitch, "a splendid man."

"oh, well, so much the better for him," said vronsky smiling. "oh,
you’ve come," he said, addressing a tall old footman of his mother’s,
standing at the door; "come here."

besides the charm oblonsky had in general for everyone, vronsky had felt
of late specially drawn to him by the fact that in his imagination he
was associated with kitty.

"well, what do you say? shall we give a supper on sunday for the
_diva?_" he said to him with a smile, taking his arm.

"of course. i’m collecting subscriptions. oh, did you make the
acquaintance of my friend levin?" asked stepan arkadyevitch.

"yes; but he left rather early."

"he’s a capital fellow," pursued oblonsky. "isn’t he?"

"i don’t know why it is," responded vronsky, "in all moscow
people—present company of course excepted," he put in jestingly,
"there’s something uncomp

bustle in the station, the rush of porters, the movement of policemen
and attendants, and people meeting the train. through the frosty vapor
could be seen workmen in short sheepskins and soft felt boots crossing
the rails of the curving line. the hiss of the boiler could be heard on
the distant rails, and the rumble of something heavy.

"no," said stepan arkadyevitch, who felt a great inclination to tell
vronsky of levin’s intentions in regard to kitty. "no, you’ve not got a
true impression of levin. he’s a very nervous man, and is sometimes out
of humor, it’s true, but then he is often very nice. he’s such a true,
honest nature, and a heart of gold. but yesterday there were special
reasons," pursued stepan arkadyevitch, with a meaning smile, totally
oblivious of the genuine sympathy he had felt the day before for his
friend, and feeling the same sympathy now, only for vronsky. "yes, there
were reasons why he could not help being eith

ger carriages rolled in, oscillating
before coming to a standstill.

a smart guard jumped out, giving a whistle, and after him one by one the
impatient passengers began to get down: an officer of the guards,
holding himself erect, and looking severely about him; a nimble little
merchant with a satchel, smiling gaily; a peasant with a sack over his
shoulder.

vronsky, standing beside oblonsky, watched the carriages and the
passengers, totally oblivious of his mother. what he had just heard
about kitty excited and delighted him. unconsciously he arched his
chest, and his eyes flashed. he felt himself a conqueror.

"countess vronskaya is in that compartment," said the smart guard, going
up to vronsky.

the guard’s words roused him, and forced him to think of his mother and
his approaching meeting with her. he did not in his heart respect his
mother, and without acknowledging it to himself, he did not love her,
though in accordance with the ideas of the set in which he lived, and
with his own

ina seated herself in the carriage, and stepan arkadyevitch
saw with surprise that her lips were quivering, and she was with
difficulty restraining her tears.

"what is it, anna?" he asked, when they had driven a few hundred yards.

"it’s an omen of evil," she said.

"what nonsense!" said stepan arkadyevitch. "you’ve come, that’s the
chief thing. you can’t conceive how i’m resting my hopes on you."

"have you known vronsky long?" she asked.

"yes. you know we’re hoping he will marry kitty."

"yes?" said anna softly. "come now, let us talk of you," she added,
tossing her head, as though she would physically shake off something
superfluous oppressing her. "let us talk of your affairs. i got your
letter, and here i am."

"yes, all my hopes are in you," said stepan arkadyevitch.

"well, tell me all about it."

and stepan arkadyevitch began to tell his story.

on reaching home oblonsky helped his sister out, sighed, pressed her
hand, and set off to his office.



chapter 19


when an

 she merely sent a brief
note to her brother to tell him that he must not fail to dine at home.
"come, god is merciful," she wrote.

oblonsky did dine at home: the conversation was general, and his wife,
speaking to him, addressed him as "stiva," as she had not done before.
in the relations of the husband and wife the same estrangement still
remained, but there was no talk now of separation, and stepan
arkadyevitch saw the possibility of explanation and reconciliation.

immediately after dinner kitty came in. she knew anna arkadyevna, but
only very slightly, and she came now to her sister’s with some
trepidation, at the prospect of meeting this fashionable petersburg
lady, whom everyone spoke so highly of. but she made a favorable
impression on anna arkadyevna—she saw that at once. anna was
unmistakably admiring her loveliness and her youth: before kitty knew
where she was she found herself not merely under anna’s sway, but in
love with her, as young girls do fall in love with older a

nd married
women. anna was not like a fashionable lady, nor the mother of a boy of
eight years old. in the elasticity of her movements, the freshness and
the unflagging eagerness which persisted in her face, and broke out in
her smile and her glance, she would rather have passed for a girl of
twenty, had it not been for a serious and at times mournful look in her
eyes, which struck and attracted kitty. kitty felt that anna was
perfectly simple and was concealing nothing, but that she had another
higher world of interests inaccessible to her, complex and poetic.

after dinner, when dolly went away to her own room, anna rose quickly
and went up to her brother, who was just lighting a cigar.

"stiva," she said to him, winking gaily, crossing him and glancing
towards the door, "go, and god help you."

he threw down the cigar, understanding her, and departed through the
doorway.

nce before dinner, and would not leave her side. and it
had become a sort of game among them to sit a close as possible to their
aunt, to touch her, hold her little hand, kiss it, play with her ring,
or even touch the flounce of her skirt.

"come, come, as we were sitting before," said anna arkadyevna, sitting
down in her place.

and again grisha poked his little face under her arm, and nestled with
his head on her gown, beaming with pride and happiness.

"and when is your next ball?" she asked kitty.

"next week, and a splendid ball. one of those balls where one always
enjoys oneself."

"why, are there balls where one always enjoys oneself?" anna said, with
tender irony.

"it’s strange, but there are. at the bobrishtchevs’ one always enjoys
oneself, and at the nikitins’ too, while at the mezhkovs’ it’s always
dull. haven’t you noticed it?"

"no, my dear, for me there are no balls now where one enjoys oneself,"
said anna, and kitty detected in her eyes that mysterious world whic

h
was not open to her. "for me there are some less dull and tiresome."

"how can _you_ be dull at a ball?"

"why should not _i_ be dull at a ball?" inquired anna.

kitty perceived that anna knew what answer would follow.

"because you always look nicer than anyone."

anna had the faculty of blushing. she blushed a little, and said:

"in the first place it’s never so; and secondly, if it were, what
difference would it make to me?"

"are you coming to this ball?" asked kitty.

"i imagine it won’t be possible to avoid going. here, take it," she said
to tanya, who was pulling the loosely-fitting ring off her white,
slender-tipped finger.

"i shall be so glad if you go. i should so like to see you at a ball."

"anyway, if i do go, i shall comfort myself with the thought that it’s a
pleasure to you ... grisha, don’t pull my hair. it’s untidy enough
without that," she said, putting up a straying lock, which grisha had
been playing with.

"i imagine you at the ba

ryone to be there to take part in it."

"how do you know? yes."

"oh! what a happy time you are at," pursued anna. "i remember, and i
know that blue haze like the mist on the mountains in switzerland. that
mist which covers everything in that blissful time when childhood is
just ending, and out of that vast circle, happy and gay, there is a path
growing narrower and narrower, and it is delightful and alarming to
enter the ballroom, bright and splendid as it is.... who has not been
through it?"

kitty smiled without speaking. "but how did she go through it? how i
should like to know all her love story!" thought kitty, recalling the
unromantic appearance of alexey alexandrovitch, her husband.

"i know something. stiva told me, and i congratulate you. i liked him so
much," anna continued. "i met vronsky at the railway station."

"oh, was he there?" asked kitty, blushing. "what was it stiva told you?"

"stiva gossiped about it all. and i should be so glad ... i traveled
yesterday with vronsky

i know mothers are partial,
but..."

"what did his mother tell you?"

"oh, a great deal! and i know that he’s her favorite; still one can see
how chivalrous he is.... well, for instance, she told me that he had
wanted to give up all his property to his brother, that he had done
something extraordinary when he was quite a child, saved a woman out of
the water. he’s a hero, in fact," said anna, smiling and recollecting
the two hundred roubles he had given at the station.

but she did not tell kitty about the two hundred roubles. for some
reason it was disagreeable to her to think of it. she felt that there
was something that had to do with her in it, and something that ought
not to have been.

"she pressed me very much to go and see her," anna went on; "and i shall
be glad to go to see her tomorrow. stiva is staying a long while in
dolly’s room, thank god," anna added, changing the subject, and getting
up, kitty fancied, displeased with something.

"no, i’m first! no, i!" screamed the

ed dolly, addressing anna;
"i want to move you downstairs, and we shall be nearer."

"oh, please, don’t trouble about me," answered anna, looking intently
into dolly’s face, trying to make out whether there had been a
reconciliation or not.

"it will be lighter for you here," answered her sister-in-law.

"i assure you that i sleep everywhere, and always like a marmot."

"what’s the question?" inquired stepan arkadyevitch, coming out of his
room and addressing his wife.

from his tone both kitty and anna knew that a reconciliation had taken
place.

"i want to move anna downstairs, but we must hang up blinds. no one
knows how to do it; i must see to it myself," answered dolly addressing
him.

"god knows whether they are fully reconciled," thought anna, hearing her
tone, cold and composed.

"oh, nonsense, dolly, always making difficulties," answered her husband.
"come, i’ll do it all, if you like..."

"yes, they must be reconciled," thought anna.

"i know how you do everything," answer

he was talking about, she kept
coming back in thought to her curly-headed seryozha. she longed to look
at his photograph and talk of him. seizing the first pretext, she got
up, and with her light, resolute step went for her album. the stairs up
to her room came out on the landing of the great warm main staircase.

just as she was leaving the drawing room, a ring was heard in the hall.

"who can that be?" said dolly.

"it’s early for me to be fetched, and for anyone else it’s late,"
observed kitty.

"sure to be someone with papers for me," put in stepan arkadyevitch.
when anna was passing the top of the staircase, a servant was running up
to announce the visitor, while the visitor himself was standing under a
lamp. anna glancing down at once recognized vronsky, and a strange
feeling of pleasure and at the same time of dread of something stirred
in her heart. he was standing still, not taking off his coat, pulling
something out of his pocket. at the instant when she was just facing the

slight inclination of her head she passed, hearing behind her stepan
arkadyevitch’s loud voice calling him to come up, and the quiet, soft,
and composed voice of vronsky refusing.

when anna returned with the album, he was already gone, and stepan
arkadyevitch was telling them that he had called to inquire about the
dinner they were giving next day to a celebrity who had just arrived.
"and nothing would induce him to come up. what a queer fellow he is!"
added stepan arkadyevitch.

kitty blushed. she thought that she was the only person who knew why he
had come, and why he would not come up. "he has been at home," she
thought, "and didn’t find me, and thought i should be here, but he did
not come up because he thought it late, and anna’s here."

all of them looked at each other, saying nothing, and began to look at
anna’s album.

there was nothing either exceptional or strange in a man’s calling at
half-past nine on a friend to inquire details of a proposed dinner party

chapter 22


the ball was only just beginning as kitty and her mother walked up the
great staircase, flooded with light, and lined with flowers and footmen
in powder and red coats. from the rooms came a constant, steady hum, as
from a hive, and the rustle of movement; and while on the landing
between trees they gave last touches to their hair and dresses before
the mirror, they heard from the ballroom the careful, distinct notes of
the fiddles of the orchestra beginning the first waltz. a little old man
in civilian dress, arranging his gray curls b

efore another mirror, and
diffusing an odor of scent, stumbled against them on the stairs, and
stood aside, evidently admiring kitty, whom he did not know. a beardless
youth, one of those society youths whom the old prince shtcherbatsky
called "young bucks," in an exceedingly open waistcoat, straightening
his white tie as he went, bowed to them, and after running by, came back
to ask kitty for a quadrille. as the first quadrille had already been
given to vronsky, she had to promise this youth the second. an officer,
buttoning his glove, stood aside in the doorway, and stroking his
mustache, admired rosy kitty.

although her dress, her coiffure, and all the preparations for the ball
had cost kitty great trouble and consideration, at this moment she
walked into the ballroom in her elaborate tulle dress over a pink slip
as easily and simply as though all the rosettes and lace, all t

he minute
details of her attire, had not cost her or her family a moment’s
attention, as though she had been born in that tulle and lace, with her
hair done up high on her head, and a rose and two leaves on the top of
it.

when, just before entering the ballroom, the princess, her mother, tried
to turn right side out of the ribbon of her sash, kitty had drawn back a
little. she felt that everything must be right of itself, and graceful,
and nothing could need setting straight.

it was one of kitty’s best days. her dress was not uncomfortable
anywhere; her lace berthe did not droop anywhere; her rosettes were not
crushed nor torn off; her pink slippers with high, hollowed-out heels
did not pinch, but gladdened her feet; and the thick rolls of fair
chignon kept up on her head as if they were her own hair. all the three
buttons buttoned up without tearing on the long glove that covered her
hand without concealing its lines. the black velvet of her locket
nestled with special softness roun

d her neck. that velvet was delicious;
at home, looking at her neck in the looking glass, kitty had felt that
that velvet was speaking. about all the rest there might be a doubt, but
the velvet was delicious. kitty smiled here too, at the ball, when she
glanced at it in the glass. her bare shoulders and arms gave kitty a
sense of chill marble, a feeling she particularly liked. her eyes
sparkled, and her rosy lips could not keep from smiling from the
consciousness of her own attractiveness. she had scarcely entered the
ballroom and reached the throng of ladies, all tulle, ribbons, lace, and
flowers, waiting to be asked to dance—kitty was never one of that
throng—when she was asked for a waltz, and asked by the best partner,
the first star in the hierarchy of the ballroom, a renowned director of
dances, a m

had only just left the countess bonina, with whom he had danced the
first half of the waltz, and, scanning his kingdom—that is to say, a few
couples who had started dancing—he caught sight of kitty, entering, and
flew up to her with that peculiar, easy amble which is confined to
directors of balls. without even asking her if she cared to dance, he
put out his arm to encircle her slender waist. she looked round for
someone to give her fan to, and their hostess, smiling to her, took it.

"how nice you’ve come in good time," he said to her, embracing her
waist; "such a bad habit to be late." bending her left hand, she laid it
on his shoulder, and her little feet in their pink slippers bega

possession to be able to observe. in the left corner of
the ballroom she saw the cream of society gathered together.
there—incredibly naked—was the beauty lidi, korsunsky’s wife; there was
the lady of the house; there shone the bald head of krivin, always to be
found where the best people were. in that direction gazed the young men,
not venturing to approach. there, too, she descried stiva, and there she
saw the exquisite figure and head of anna in a black velvet gown. and
_he_ was there. kitty had not seen him since the evening she refused
levin. with her long-sighted eyes, she knew him at once, and was even
aware that he was looking at her.

"another turn, eh? you’re not tired?" said korsunsky, a little out of
breath.

"no, thank you!"

"where shall i take you?"

"madame karenina’s here, i think ... take me to her."

"wherever you command."

and korsunsky began waltzing with measured steps straight towards the
group in the left corner, continually saying, "pardon, mesdames, pard

on,
pardon, mesdames"; and steering his course through the sea of lace,
tulle, and ribbon, and not disarranging a feather, he turned his partner
sharply round, so that her slim ankles, in light transparent stockings,
were exposed to view, and her train floated out in fan shape and covered
krivin’s knees. korsunsky bowed, set straight his open shirt front, and
gave her his arm to conduct her to anna arkadyevna. kitty, flushed, took
her train from krivin’s knees, and, a little giddy, looked round,
seeking anna. anna was not in lilac, as kitty had so urgently wished,
but in a black, low-cut, velvet gown, showing her full throat and
shoulders, that looked as though carved in old ivory, and her rounded
arms, with tiny, slender wrists. the whole gown was trimmed with
venetian guipure. on her head, among her black hair—her own, with no
false additions—was a little wreath of pansies, and a bouquet of the

e in the black ribbon of her sash among white lace. her coiffure was
not striking. all that was noticeable was the little wilful tendrils of
her curly hair that would always break free about her neck and temples.
round her well-cut, strong neck was a thread of pearls.

kitty had been seeing anna every day; she adored her, and had pictured
her invariably in lilac. but now seeing her in black, she felt that she
had not fully seen her charm. she saw her now as someone quite new and
surprising to her. now she understood that anna could not have been in
lilac, and that her charm was just that she always stood out against her
attire, that her dress could never be noticeable on her. and her black
dress, with its sumptuous lace, was not noticeable on her; it was only
the f

rame, and all that was seen was she—simple, natural, elegant, and
at the same time gay and eager.

she was standing holding herself, as always, very erect, and when kitty
drew near the group she was speaking to the master of the house, her
head slightly turned towards him.

"no, i don’t throw stones," she was saying, in answer to something,
"though i can’t understand it," she went on, shrugging her shoulders,
and she turned at once with a soft smile of protection towards kitty.
with a flying, feminine glance she scanned her attire, and made a
movement of her head, hardly perceptible, but understood by kitty,
signifying approval of her dress and her looks. "you came into the room
dancing," she added.

"this is one of my most faithful supporters," said korsunsky, bowing to
anna arkadyevna, whom he had not yet seen. "the princess helps to make
balls happy and successful. anna arkadyevna, a waltz?" he said, bending
down to her.

"why, have you met?" inquired their host.

 
 ___________________________
 

"is there anyone we have not met? my wife and i are like white
wolves—everyone knows us," answered korsunsky. "a waltz, anna
arkadyevna?"

"i don’t dance when it’s possible not to dance," she said.

"but tonight it’s impossible," answered korsunsky.

at that instant vronsky came up.

"well, since it’s impossible tonight, let us start," she said, not
noticing vronsky’s bow, and she hastily put her hand on korsunsky’s
shoulder.

"what is she vexed with him about?" thought kitty, discerning that anna
had intentionally not responded to vronsky’s bow. vronsky went up to
kitty reminding her of the first quadrille, and expressing his regret
that he had not seen her all this time. kitty gazed in admiration at
anna waltzing, and listened to him. she expected him to ask her for a
waltz, but he did not, and she glanced wonderingly at him. he flushed
slightly, and hurriedly asked her to waltz, but he had only just put his
arm round her waist and taken the first step when the

music suddenly
stopped. kitty looked into his face, which was so close to her own, and
long afterwards—for several years after—that look, full of love, to
which he made no response, cut her to the heart with an agony of shame.

"_pardon! pardon!_ waltz! waltz!" shouted korsunsky from the other side
of the room, and seizing the first young lady he came across he began
dancing himself.



chapter 23


vronsky and kitty waltzed several times round the room. after the first
waltz kitty went to her mother, and she had hardly time to say a few
words to countess nordston when vronsky came up again for the first
quadrille. during the quadrille nothing of any significance was said:
there was disjointed talk between them of the korsunskys, husband and
wife, whom he described very amusingly, as delightful children at forty,
and of the future town theater; and only once the conversation touched
her to the quick, when he asked her about levin, whether he was here,
and added that he li

ked him so much. but kitty did not expect much from
the quadrille. she looked forward with a thrill at her heart to the
mazurka. she fancied that in the mazurka everything must be decided. the
fact that he did not during the quadrille ask her for the mazurka did
not trouble her. she felt sure she would dance the mazurka with him as
she had done at former balls, and refused five young men, saying she was
engaged for the mazurka. the whole ball up to the last quadrille was for
kitty an enchanted vision of delightful colors, sounds, and motions. she
only sat down when she felt too tired and begged for a rest. but as she
was dancing the last quadrille with one of the tiresome young men whom
she could not refuse, she chanced to be vis-a-vis with vronsky and anna.
she had not been near anna again since the beginning of the evening, and
now again she saw her suddenly quite new and surprising. she saw in her
the signs of that excitement of success she knew so well in herself; sh

d rond_, and then into the _châine_, and at the same time she kept
watch with a growing pang at her heart. "no, it’s not the admiration of
the crowd has intoxicated her, but the adoration of one. and that one?
can it be he?" every time he spoke to anna the joyous light flashed into
her eyes, and the smile of happiness curved her red lips. she seemed to
make an effort to control herself, to try not to show these signs of
delight, but they came out on her face of themselves. "but what of him?"
kitty looked at him and was filled with terror. what was pictured so
clearly to kitty in the mirror of anna’s face she saw in him. what had
become of his always self-possessed resolute manner, and the carelessly
serene expression of his face? now every time he turned to her, he bent
his head, as though he would have fallen at her feet, and in his eyes
there was nothing but humble submission and dread. "i would not offend
you," his eyes seemed every time to be saying, "but i want to save
myself, and
 
 ___________________________
 
 i don’t know how." on his face was a look such as kitty had
never seen before.

they were speaking of common acquaintances, keeping up the most trivial
conversation, but to kitty it seemed that every word they said was
determining their fate and hers. and strange it was that they were
actually talking of how absurd ivan ivanovitch was with his french, and
how the eletsky girl might have made a better match, yet these words had
all the while consequence for them, and they were feeling just as kitty
did. the whole ball, the whole world, everything seemed lost in fog in
kitty’s soul. nothing but the stern discipline of her bringing-up
supported her and forced her to do what was expected of her, that is, to
dance, to answer questions, to talk, even to smile. but before the
mazurka, when they were beginning to rearrange the chairs and a few
couples moved out of the smaller rooms into the big room, a moment of
despair and horror came for kitty. she had refused five partners, and
now she was

arent skirts rose like a cloud about her slender waist; one bare,
thin, soft, girlish arm, hanging listlessly, was lost in the folds of
her pink tunic; in the other she held her fan, and with rapid, short
strokes fanned her burning face. but while she looked like a butterfly,
clinging to a blade of grass, and just about to open its rainbow wings
for fresh flight, her heart ached with a horrible despair.

"but perhaps i am wrong, perhaps it was not so?" and again she recalled
all she had seen.

"kitty, what is it?" said countess nordston, stepping noiselessly over
the carpet towards her. "i don’t understand it."

kitty’s lower lip began to quiver; she got up quickly.

"kitty, you’re not dancing the mazurka?"

"no, no," said kitty in a voice shaking with tears.

"he asked her for the mazurka before me," said countess nordston,
knowing kitty would understand who were "he" and "her." "she said: ‘why,
aren’t you going to dance it with princess shtcherbatskaya?’"

"oh, i don’t care!
 
 ___________________________
 
" answered kitty.

no one but she herself understood her position; no one knew that she had
just refused the man whom perhaps she loved, and refused him because she
had put her faith in another.

countess nordston found korsunsky, with whom she was to dance the
mazurka, and told him to ask kitty.

kitty danced in the first couple, and luckily for her she had not to
talk, because korsunsky was all the time running about directing the
figure. vronsky and anna sat almost opposite her. she saw them with her
long-sighted eyes, and saw them, too, close by, when they met in the
figures, and the more she saw of them the more convinced was she that
her unhappiness was complete. she saw that they felt themselves alone in
that crowded room. and on vronsky’s face, always so firm and
independent, she saw

 that look that had struck her, of bewilderment and
humble submissiveness, like the expression of an intelligent dog when it
has done wrong.

anna smiled, and her smile was reflected by him. she grew thoughtful,
and he became serious. some supernatural force drew kitty’s eyes to
anna’s face. she was fascinating in her simple black dress, fascinating
were her round arms with their bracelets, fascinating was her firm neck
with its thread of pearls, fascinating the straying curls of her loose
hair, fascinating the graceful, light movements of her little feet and
hands, fascinating was that lovely face in its eagerness, but there was
something terrible and cruel in her fascination.

kitty admired her more than ever, and more and more acute was her
suffering. 
 
 ___________________________
 
kitty felt overwhelmed, and her face showed it. when vronsky
saw her, coming across her in the mazurka, he did not at once recognize
her, she was so changed.

"delightful ball!" he said to her, for the sake of saying something.

"yes," she answered.

in the middle of the mazurka, repeating a complicated figure, newly
invented by korsunsky, anna came forward into the center of the circle,
chose two gentlemen, and summoned a lady and kitty. kitty gazed at her
in dismay as she went up. anna looked at her with drooping eyelids, and
smiled, pressing her hand. but, noticing that kitty only responded to
her smile by a look of despair and amazement, she turned away from her,
and began gaily talking to the other lady.

"yes, there is something uncanny, devilish and fascinating in her,"
kitty said to herself.

anna did not mean to stay to supper, but the master of the house began
to press her to do so.

"nonsense, anna arkadyevna," said korsuns

iss.... all’s well."



chapter 28


after the ball, early next morning, anna arkadyevna sent her husband a
telegram that she was leaving moscow the same day.

"no, i must go, i must go"; she explained to her sister-in-law the
change in her plans in a tone that suggested that she had to remember so
many things that there was no enumerating them: "no, it had really
better be today!"

stepan arkadyevitch was not dining at home, but he promised to come and
see his sister off at seven o’clock.

kitty, too, did not come, sending a note that she had a headache. dolly
and anna dined alone with the children and the english governess.
whether it was that the children were fickle, or that they had acute
senses, and felt that anna was quite different that day from what she
had been when they had taken such a fancy to her, that she was not now
interested in them,—but they had abruptly dropped their play with their
aunt, and their love for her, and were quite indifferent that she was
going away. a

 lips.

"come, he’s amusing, anyway, your _skeleton_, and not depressing," said
dolly, smiling.

"no, he’s depressing. do you know why i’m going today instead of
tomorrow? it’s a confession that weighs on me; i want to make it to
you," said anna, letting herself drop definitely into an armchair, and
looking straight into dolly’s face.

and to her surprise dolly saw that anna was blushing up to her ears, up
to the curly black ringlets on her neck.

"yes," anna went on. "do you know why kitty didn’t come to dinner? she’s
jealous of me. i have spoiled ... i’ve been the cause of that ball being
a torture to her instead of a pleasure. but truly, truly, it’s not my
fault, or only my fault a little bit," she said, daintily drawling the
words "a little bit."

"oh, how like stiva you said that!" said dolly, laughing.

anna was hurt.

"oh no, oh no! i’m not stiva," she said, knitting her brows. "that’s why
i’m telling you, just because i could never let myself doubt myself for

simply to avoid meeting him.

"yes, stiva told me you danced the mazurka with him, and that he..."

"you can’t imagine how absurdly it all came about. i only meant to be
matchmaking, and all at once it turned out quite differently. possibly
against my own will..."

she crimsoned and stopped.

"oh, they feel it directly?" said dolly.

"but i should be in despair if there were anything serious in it on his
side," anna interrupted her. "and i am certain it will all be forgotten,
and kitty will leave off hating me."

"all the same, anna, to tell you the truth, i’m not very anxious for
this marriage for kitty. and it’s better it should come to nothing, if
he, vronsky, is capable of falling in love with you in a single day."

"oh, heavens, that would be too silly!" said anna, and again a deep
flush of pleasure came out on her face, when she heard the idea, that
absorbed her, put into words. "and so here i am going away, having made
an enemy of kitty, whom i liked so much! ah, h

part two



chapter 1


at the end of the winter, in the shtcherbatskys’ house, a consultation
was being held, which was to pronounce on the state of kitty’s health
and the measures to be taken to restore her failing strength. she had
been ill, and as spring came on she grew worse. the family doctor gave
her cod liver oil, then iron, then nitrate of silver, but as the first
and the second and the third were alike in doing no good, and as his
advice when spring came was to go abroad, a celebrated physician was
called in. the celebrated physician, a very handsome man, still
youngish, asked to examine the patient. he maintained, with peculiar
satis
 
 ___________________________
 
ly he considered modesty in the girl not merely
as a relic of barbarism, but also as an insult to himself.

there was nothing for it but to submit, since, although all the doctors
had studied in the same school, had read the same books, and learned the
same science, and though some people said this celebrated doctor was a
bad doctor, in the princess’s household and circle it was for some
reason accepted that this celebrated doctor alone had some special
knowledge, and that he alone could save kitty. after a careful
examination and sounding of the bewildered patient, dazed with shame,
the celebrated doctor, having scrupulously washed his hands, was
standing in the drawing room talking to the prince. the prince frowned
and coughed, listening to the doctor. as a man who had seen something of
life, and neither a fool nor an invalid, he had no faith in medicine,
and in his heart was furious at the whole farce, specially as he was
perhaps the only one who fully comprehended the cause of kitty
 
 ___________________________
 
 gentleman, and with difficulty condescending to the level
of his intelligence. he perceived that it was no good talking to the old
man, and that the principal person in the house was the mother. before
her he decided to scatter his pearls. at that instant the princess came
into the drawing room with the family doctor. the prince withdrew,
trying not to show how ridiculous he thought the whole performance. the
princess was distracted, and did not know what to do. she felt she had
sinned against kitty.

"well, doctor, decide our fate," said the princess. "tell me
everything."

"is there hope?" she meant to say, but her lips quivered, and she could
not utter the question. "well, doctor?"

"immediately, princess. i will talk it over with my colleague, and then
i will have the honor of laying my opinion before you."

"so we had better leave you?"

"as you please."

the princess went out with a sigh.

when the doctors were left alone, the family doctor began timidly
explaining his opinion, that

evous.... they ought to be persuaded.... well, let them
go then."

he glanced once more at his watch.

"oh! time’s up already," and he went to the door. the celebrated doctor
announced to the princess (a feeling of what was due from him dictated
his doing so) that he ought to see the patient once more.

"what! another examination!" cried the mother, with horror.

"oh, no, only a few details, princess."

"come this way."

and the mother, accompanied by the doctor, went into the drawing room to
kitty. wasted and flushed, with a peculiar glitter in her eyes, left
there by the agony of shame she had been put through, kitty stood in the
middle of the room. when the doctor came in she flushed crimson, and her
eyes filled with tears. all her illness and treatment struck her as a
thing so stupid, ludicrous even! doctoring her seemed to her as absurd
as putting together the pieces of a broken vase. her heart was broken.
why would they try to cure her with pills and powders? but she could not
griev
 
 ___________________________
 
cially as her mother considered herself to blame.

"may i trouble you to sit down, princess?" the celebrated doctor said to
her.

he sat down with a smile, facing her, felt her pulse, and again began
asking her tiresome questions. she answered him, and all at once got up,
furious.

"excuse me, doctor, but there is really no object in this. this is the
third time you’ve asked me the same thing."

the celebrated doctor did not take offense.

"nervous irritability," he said to the princess, when kitty had left the
room. "however, i had finished..."

and the doctor began scientifically explaining to the princess, as an
exceptionally intelligent woman, the condition of the young princess,
and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters, which were
certainly harmless. at the question: should they go abroad? the doctor
plunged into deep meditation, as though resolving a weighty problem.
finally his decision was pronounced: they were to go abroad, but to put
no faith in foreign quacks, a

nd to apply to him in any need.

it seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after
the doctor had gone. the mother was much more cheerful when she went
back to her daughter, and kitty pretended to be more cheerful. she had
often, almost always, to be pretending now.

"really, i’m quite well, mamma. but if you want to go abroad, let’s go!"
she said, and trying to appear interested in the proposed tour, she
began talking of the preparations for the journey.



chapter 2


soon after the doctor, dolly had arrived. she knew that there was to be
a consultation that day, and though she was only just up after her
confinement (she had another baby, a little girl, born at the end
 
 ___________________________
 
 of the
winter), though she had trouble and anxiety enough of her own, she had
left her tiny baby and a sick child, to come and hear kitty’s fate,
which was to be decided that day.

"well, well?" she said, coming into the drawing room, without taking off
her hat. "you’re all in good spirits. good news, then?"

they tried to tell her what the doctor had said, but it appeared that
though the doctor had talked distinctly enough and at great length, it
was utterly impossible to report what he had said. the only point of
interest was that it was settled they should go abroad.

dolly could not help sighing. her dearest friend, her s
 
 ___________________________
 
mean breaking up
family habits, and she let herself be deceived, despising him and still
more herself, for the weakness. besides this, the care of her large
family was a constant worry to her: first, the nursing of her young baby
did not go well, then the nurse had gone away, now one of the children
had fallen ill.

"well, how are all of you?" asked her mother.

"ah, mamma, we have plenty of troubles of our own. lili is ill, and i’m
afraid it’s scarlatina. i have come here now to hear about kitty, and
then i shall shut myself up entirely, if—god forbid—it should be
scarlatina."

the old prince too had come in from his study after the doctor’s
departure, and after presenting his cheek to dolly, and saying a few
words to her, he turned to his wife:

"how have you settled it? you’re going? well, and what do you mean to do
with me?"

"i suppose you had better stay here, alexander," said his wife.

"that’s as you like."

"mamma, why shouldn’t father come with us?" said kitty. "it

 would be
nicer for him and for us too."

the old prince got up and stroked kitty’s hair. she lifted her head and
looked at him with a forced smile. it always seemed to her that he
understood her better than anyone in the family, though he did not say
much about her. being the youngest, she was her father’s favorite, and
she fancied that his love gave him insight. when now her glance met his
blue kindly eyes looking intently at her, it seemed to her that he saw
right through her, and understood all that was not good that was passing
within her. reddening, she stretched o

forest?"

"no, he’s still getting ready for the journey."

"oh, that’s it!" said the prince. "and so am i to be getting ready for a
journey too? at your service," he said to his wife, sitting down. "and i
tell you what, katia," he went on to his younger daughter, "you must
wake up one fine day and say to yourself: why, i’m quite well, and
merry, and going out again with father for an early morning walk in the
frost. hey?"

what her father said seemed simple enough, yet at these words kitty
became confused and overcome like a detected criminal. "yes, he sees it
all, he understands it all, and in these words he’s telling me that
though i’m ashamed, i must get over my shame." she could not pluck up
spirit to make any answer. she tried to begin, and all at once burst
into tears, and rushed out of the room.

"see what comes of your jokes!" the princess pounced down on her
husband. "you’re always..." she began a string of reproaches.

the prince listened to the princess’s scold
 
 ___________________________
 
casions.

"alexander, alexander," she whispered, moving to him and beginning to
weep.

as soon as she began to cry the prince too calmed down. he went up to
her.

"there, that’s enough, that’s enough! you’re wretched too, i know. it
can’t be helped. there’s no great harm done. god is merciful ...
thanks..." he said, not knowing what he was saying, as he responded to
the tearful kiss of the princess that he felt on his hand. and the
prince went out of the room.

before this, as soon as kitty went out of the room in tears, dolly, with
her motherly, family instincts, had promptly perceived that here a
woman’s work lay before her, and she prepared to do it. she took off her
hat, and, morally speaking, tucked up her sleeves and prepared for
action. while her mother was attacking her father, she tried to restrain
her mother, so far as filial reverence would allow. during the prince’s
outburst she was silent; she felt ashamed for her mother, and tender
towards her father for so quick

ly being kind again. but when her father
left them she made ready for what was the chief thing needful—to go to
kitty and console her.

"i’d been meaning to tell you something for a long while, mamma: did you
know that levin meant to make kitty an offer when he was here the last
time? he told stiva so."

"well, what then? i don’t understand..."

"so did kitty perhaps refuse him?... she didn’t tell you so?"

"no, she has said nothing to me either of one or the other; she’s too
proud. but i know it’s all on account of the other."

"yes, but suppose she has refused levin, and she wouldn’t have refused
him if it hadn’t been for the other, i know. and then, he has deceived
her so horribly."

it was too terrible for the princess to think how she had sinned against
her daughter, and she broke out angrily.

"oh, i really don’t understand! nowada

ys they will all go their own way,
and mothers haven’t a word to say in anything, and then..."

"mamma, i’ll go up to her."

"well, do. did i tell you not to?" said her mother.



chapter 3


when she went into kitty’s little room, a pretty, pink little room, full
of knick-knacks in _vieux saxe,_ as fresh, and pink, and white, and gay
as kitty herself had been two months ago, dolly remembered how they had
decorated the room the year before together, with what love and gaiety.
her heart turned cold when she saw kitty sitting on a low chair near the
door, her eyes fixed immovably on a corner of the rug. kitty glanced at
her sister, and the cold, rather ill-tempered expression of her face did
not change.

"i’m just going now, and i shall have to keep in and you won’t be able
to come to see me," said dolly, sitting down beside her. "
 
 ___________________________
 
i want to talk
to you."

"what about?" kitty asked swiftly, lifting her head in dismay.

"what should it be, but your trouble?"

"i have no trouble."

"nonsense, kitty. do you suppose i could help knowing? i know all about
it. and believe me, it’s of so little consequence.... we’ve all been
through it."

kitty did not speak, and her face had a stern expression.

"he’s not worth your grieving over him," pursued darya alexandrovna,
coming straight to the point.

"no, because he has treated me with contempt," said kitty, in a breaking
voice. "don’t talk of it! please, don’t talk of it!"

"but who can have told you so? no one has said that. i’m certain he was
in love with you, and would still be in love with you, if it hadn’t...

"oh, the most awful thing of all for me is this sympathizing!" sh
 
 ___________________________
 
rieked
kitty, suddenly flying into a passion. she turned round on her chair,
flushed crimson, and rapidly moving her fingers, pinched the clasp of
her belt first with one hand and then with the other. dolly knew this
trick her sister had of clenching her hands when she was much excited;
she knew, too, that in moments of excitement kitty was capable of
forgetting herself and saying a great deal too much, and dolly would
have soothed her, but it was too late.

"what, what is it you want to make me feel, eh?" said kitty quickly.
"that i’ve been in love with a man who didn’t care a straw for me, and
that i’m dying of love for him? and this is said to me by my own sister,
who imagines that ... that ... that she’s sympathizing with me!... i
don’t want these condolences and humbug!"

"kitty, you’re unjust."

"why are you 
 
 ___________________________
 
tormenting me?"

"but i ... quite the contrary ... i see you’re unhappy..."

but kitty in her fury did not hear her.

"i’ve nothing to grieve over and be comforted about. i am too proud ever
to allow myself to care for a man who does not love me."

"yes, i don’t say so either.... only one thing. tell me the truth," said
darya alexandrovna, taking her by the hand: "tell me, did levin speak to
you?..."

the mention of levin’s name seemed to deprive kitty of the last vestige
of self-control. she leaped up from her chair, and flinging her clasp on
the ground, she gesticulated rapidly with her hands and said:

"why bring levin in too? i can’t understand what you want to torment me
for. i’ve told you, and i say it again, that i have some pride, and
never, _never_ would i do as you’re doing—go back to a man who’s
deceived you, who has cared for another woman. i can’t understand it!
you may, but i can’t!"

and saying these words she gla

nced at her sister, and seeing that dolly
sat silent, her head mournfully bowed, kitty, instead of running out of
the room as she had meant to do, sat down near the door, and hid her
face in her handkerchief.

the silence lasted for two minutes: dolly was thinking of herself. that
humiliation of which she was always conscious came back to her with a
peculiar bitterness when her sister reminded her of it. she had not
looked for such cruelty in her sister, and she was angry with her. but
suddenly she heard the rustle of a skirt, and with it the sound of
heart-rending, smothered sob

bing, and felt arms about her neck. kitty
was on her knees before her.

"dolinka, i am so, so wretched!" she whispered penitently. and the sweet
face covered with tears hid itself in darya alexandrovna’s skirt.

as though tears were the indispensable oil, without which the machinery
of mutual confidence could not run smoothly between the two sisters, the
sisters after their tears talked, not of what was uppermost in their
minds, but, though they talked of outside matters, they understood each
other. kitty knew that the words she had

uttered in anger about her
husband’s infidelity and her humiliating position had cut her poor
sister to the heart, but that she had forgiven her. dolly for her part
knew all she had wanted to find out. she felt certain that her surmises
were correct; that kitty’s misery, her inconsolable misery, was due
precisely to the fact that levin had made her an offer and she had
refused him, and vronsky had deceived her, and that she was fully
prepared to love levin and to detest vronsky. kitty said not a word of
that; she talked of nothing but her spiritual condition.

"i have nothing to make me miserable," she said, getting calmer; "but
can you understand that everything has become hateful, loathsome, coarse
to me, and i myself most of all? you can’t imagine what loathsome
thoughts i have about everything."

"why, whatever loathsome thoughts can you have?" asked dolly, smiling.

"the most utterly loathsome and coarse: i can’t tell you. it’s not
unhappiness, or low spirits, but

ever since this change had taken place in her, stepan arkadyevitch had
become insufferably repulsive to her, and that she could not see him
without the grossest and most hideous conceptions rising before her
imagination.

"oh, well, everything presents itself to me, in the coarsest, most
loathsome light," she went on. "that’s my illness. perhaps it will pass
off."

"but you mustn’t think about it."

"i can’t help it. i’m never happy except with

the children at your
house."

"what a pity you can’t be with me!"

"oh, yes, i’m coming. i’ve had scarlatina, and i’ll persuade mamma to
let me."

kitty insisted on having her way, and went to stay at her sister’s and
nursed the children all through the scarlatina, for scarlatina it turned
out to be. the two sisters brought all the six children successfully
through it, but kitty was no better in health, and in lent the
shtcherbatskys went abroad.

the highest petersburg society is essentially one: in it everyone knows
everyone else, everyone even visits everyone else. but this great set
has its subdivisions. anna arkadyevna karenina had friends and close
ties in three different circles of this highest society. one circle was

subordinates, brought together in the most various and cap

perceptible resolute smile on her lips, was listening in silence to the
conversation.

"i think," said anna, playing with the glove she had taken off, "i think
... of so many men, so many minds, certainly so many hearts, so many
kinds of love."

vronsky was gazing at anna, and with a fainting heart waiting for what
she would say. he sighed as after a danger escaped when she uttered
these words.

anna suddenly turned to him.

"oh, i have had a letter from moscow. they write me that kitty
shtcherbatskaya’s very ill."

"really?" said vronsky, knitting his brows.

anna looked sternly at him.

"that doesn’t interest you?"

"on the contrary, it does, very much. what was it exactly they told you,
if i may know?" he questioned.

anna got up and went to betsy.

"give me a cup of tea," she said, standing at her table.

while betsy was pouring out the tea, vronsky went up to anna.

"what is it they write to you?" he repeated.

"i often think men have no understanding of what’s not

eyes, and hot all over from the burning flush on her cheeks. "i’ve come
on purpose this evening, knowing i should meet you. i have come to tell
you that this must end. i have never blushed before anyone, and you
force me to feel to blame for something."

he looked at her and was struck by a new spiritual beauty in her face.

"what do you wish of me?" he said simply and seriously.

"i want you to go to moscow and ask for kitty’s forgiveness," she said.

"you don’t wish that?" he said.

he saw she was saying what she forced herself to say, not what she
wanted to say.

"if you love me, as you say," she whispered, "do so that i may be at
peace."

his face grew radiant.

"don’t you know that you’re all my life to me? but i know no peace, and
i can’t give it to you; all myself—and love ... yes. i can’t think of
you and myself apart. you and i are one to me. and i see no chance

causing him so much suffering as those trivial but humiliating
reminiscences. these wounds never healed. and with these memories was
now ranged his rejection and the pitiful position in which he must have
appeared to others that evening. but time and work did their part.
bitter memories were more and more covered up by the incidents—paltry in
his eyes, but really important—of his country life. every week he
thought less often of kitty. he was impatiently looking forward to the
news that she was married, or just going to be married, hoping that such
news would, like having a tooth out, completely cure him.

meanwhile spring came on, beautiful and kindly, without the delays and
treacheries of spring,—one of those rare springs in which plants,
beasts, and man rejoice alike. this lovely spring roused levin still
more, and strengthened him in his resolution of renouncing all his past
and building up his lonely life firmly and i

tepan arkadyevitch, forgetting that it was not always
spring and fine weather like that day. "and your nurse is simply
charming! a pretty maid in an apron might be even more agreeable,
perhaps; but for your severe monastic style it does very well."

stepan arkadyevitch told him many interesting pieces of news; especially
interesting to levin was the news that his brother, sergey ivanovitch,
was intending to pay him a visit in the summer.

not one word did stepan arkadyevitch say in reference to kitty and the
shtcherbatskys; he merely gave him greetings from his wife. levin was
grateful to him for his delicacy and was very glad of his visitor. as
always happened with him during his solitude, a mass of ideas and
feelings had been accumulating within him, which he could not
communicate to those about him. and now he poured out upon stepan
arkadyevitch his poetic joy in the spring, and his failures and plans
for the land, and his thoughts and criticisms on the books he had been
reading, and the

"why, who prevents you?" said levin, smiling.

"no, you’re a lucky man! you’ve got everything you like. you like
horses—and you have them; dogs—you have them; shooting—you have it;
farming—you have it."

"perhaps because i rejoice in what i have, and don’t fret for what i
haven’t," said levin, thinking of kitty.

stepan arkadyevitch comprehended, looked at him, but said nothing.

levin was grateful to oblonsky for noticing, with his never-failing
tact, that he dreaded conversation about the shtcherbatskys, and so
saying nothing about them. but now levin was longing to find out what
was tormenting him so, yet he had not the courage to begin.

"come, tell me how things are going with you," said levin, bethinking
himself that it was not nice of him to think only of himself.

but at that very instant both suddenly heard a shrill whistle which, as
it were, smote on their ears, and both suddenly seized their guns and
two flashes gleamed, and two bangs sounded at the very same instant. the
snipe flying high above instantly folded its wings and fell into a
thicket, bending down the delicate shoots.

"splendid! together!" cried levin, and he ran with laska into the
thicket to look for the snipe.

"oh, yes, what was it that was unpleasant?" he wondered. "yes, kitty’s
ill.... well, it can’t be helped; i’m very sorry," he thought.

"she’s found it! isn’t she a clever thing?" he said, taking the warm
bird from laska’s mouth and packing it into the almost full game bag.
"i’ve got it, stiva!" he shouted.



chapter 16


on the way home levin asked all details of kitty’s illness and the
shtcherbatskys’ plans, and though he would have been ashamed to admit
it, he was pleased at what he heard. he was pleased that there was still
hope, and still 
 
 ___________________________
 
more pleased that she should be suffering who had made
him suffer so much. but when stepan arkadyevitch began to speak of the
causes of kitty’s illness, and mentioned vronsky’s name, levin cut him
short.

"i have no right whatever to know family matters, and, to tell the
truth, no interest in them either."

stepan arkadyevitch smiled hardly perceptibly, catching the
instantaneous change he knew so well in levin’s face, which had become
as gloomy as it had been bright a minute before.

"have you quite settled about the forest with ryabinin?" asked levin.

"yes, it’s settled. the price is magnificent; thirty-eight thousand.

business of the forest was over, the money in his pocket; their shooting
had been excellent, and stepan arkadyevitch was in the happiest frame of
mind, and so he felt specially anxious to dissipate the ill-humor that
had come upon levin. he wanted to finish the day at supper as pleasantly
as it had been begun.

levin certainly was out of humor, and in spite of all his desire to be
affectionate and cordial to his charming visitor, he could not control
his mood. the intoxication of the news that kitty was not married had
gradually begun to work upon him.

kitty was not married, but ill, and ill from love for a man who had
slighted her. this slight, as it were, rebounded upon him. vronsky had
slighted her, and she had slighted him, levin. consequently vronsky had
the right to despise levin, and therefore he was his enemy. but all this
levin did not think out. he vaguely felt that there was something in it
insulting to him, and he was not angry now at what had disturbed him,
but he fell foul o

they took, and from their name and from the friends they made, were
immediately crystallized into a definite place marked out for them.

there was visiting the watering-place that year a real german fürstin,
in consequence of which the crystallizing process went on more
vigorously than ever. princess shtcherbatskaya wished, above everything,
to present her daughter to this german princess, and the day after their
arrival she duly performed this rite. kitty made a low and graceful
curtsey in the _very simple_, that is to say, very elegant frock that
had been ordered her from paris. the german princess said, "i hope the
roses will soon come back to this pretty little face," and for the
shtcherbatskys certain definite lines of existence were at once laid
down from which there was no departing. the shtcherbatskys made the
acquaintance too of the family of an english lady somebody, and of a
german countess and her son, wounded in the last war, and of

swede, and of m. canut and his sister. but yet inevitably the
shtcherbatskys were thrown most into the society of a moscow lady, marya
yevgenyevna rtishtcheva and her daughter, whom kitty disliked, because
she had fallen ill, like herself, over a love affair, and a moscow
colonel, whom kitty had known from childhood, and always seen in uniform
and epaulets, and who now, with his little eyes and his open neck and
flowered cravat, was uncommonly ridiculous and tedious, because there
was no getting rid of him. when all this was so firmly established,
kitty began to be very much bored, especially as the prince went away to
carlsbad and she was left alone with her mother. she took no interest in
the people she knew, feeling that nothing fresh would come of them. her
chief mental interes

t in the watering-place consisted in watching and
making theories about the people she did not know. it was characteristic
of kitty that she always imagined everything in people in the most
favorable light possible, especially so in those she did not know. and
now as she made surmises as to who people were, what were their
relations to one another, and what they were like, kitty endowed them
with the most marvelous and noble characters, and found confirmation of
her idea in her observations.

of these people the one that attracted her most was a russian girl who
had come to the watering-place with an invalid russian lady, madame
stahl, as everyone called her. madame stahl belonged to the highest
society, but she was so ill that she could not walk, and only on
exceptionally fine days made her appearance at the springs in an invalid
carriage. but it was not so much from 
 
 ___________________________
 
ill-health as from pride—so
princess shtcherbatskaya interpreted it—that madame stahl had not made
the acquaintance of anyone among the russians there. the russian girl
looked after madame stahl, and besides that, she was, as kitty observed,
on friendly terms with all the invalids who were seriously ill, and
there were many of them at the springs, and looked after them in the
most natural way. this russian girl was not, as kitty gathered, related
to madame stahl, nor was she a paid attendant. madame stahl called her
varenka, and other people called her "mademoiselle varenka." apart from
the interest kitty took in this girl’s relations with madame stahl and
with other unknown persons, kitty, as often happened, felt an
inexplicable attraction to mademoiselle varenka, and was aware when
their eyes met that she too liked her.

of mademoiselle varenka one would not say that she had passed her first
youth, but she was, as

separately, she was handsome rather than plain, in spite of the sickly
hue of her face. she would have been a good figure, too, if it had not
been for her extreme thinness and the size of her head, which was too
large for her medium height. but she was not likely to be attractive to
men. she was like a fine flower, already past its bloom and without
fragrance, though the petals were still unwithered. moreover, she would
have been unattractive to men also from the lack of just what kitty had
too much of—of the suppressed fire of vitality, and the consciousness of
her own attractiveness.

she always seemed absorbed in work about which there could be no doubt,
and so it seemed she could not take interest in anything outside it. it
was just this contrast with her own position that was for kitty the
great attraction of mademoiselle varenka. kitty felt that in her, in her
manner of life, she would find an example of what she was now so
painfully seeking: interest in life, a dignit

y in life—apart from the
worldly relations of girls with men, which so revolted kitty, and
appeared to her now as a shameful hawking about of goods in search of a
purchaser. the more attentively kitty watched her unknown friend, the
more convinced she was this girl was the perfect creature she fancied
her, and the more eagerly she wished to make her acquaintance.

the two girls used to meet several times a day, and every time they met,
kitty’s eyes said: "who are you? what are you? are you really the
exquisite creature i imagine you to be? but for goodness’ sake don’t
suppose," her eyes added, "that i would force my acquaintance on you, i
simply admire you and like you." "i like you too, and you’re very, very
sweet. and i should like you better still, if i had time," answered the
eyes of the unknown girl. kitty saw indeed, that she was always busy.

ng to interest an irritable invalid, or selecting and buying
cakes for tea for someone.

soon after the arrival of the shtcherbatskys there appeared in the
morning crowd at the springs two persons who attracted universal and
unfavorable attention. these were a tall man with a stooping figure, and
huge hands, in an old coat too short for him, with black, simple, and
yet terrible eyes, and a pockmarked, kind-looking woman, very badly and
tastelessly dressed. recognizing these persons as russians, kitty had
already in her imagination begun constructing a delightful and touching
romance about them. but the princess, having ascertained from the
visitors’ list that this was nikolay levin and marya nikolaevna,
explained to kitty what a bad man this levin was, and all her fancies
about these two people vanished. not so much from what her mother told
her, as from the fact that it was konstantin’s brother, this pair
suddenly seemed to kitty intensely unpleasant. this levin, with his
continual twi

tching of his head, aroused in her now an irrepressible
feeling of disgust.

it seemed to her that his big, terrible eyes, which persistently pursued
her, expressed a feeling of hatred and contempt, and she tried to avoid
meeting him.



chapter 31


it was a wet day; it had been raining all the morning, and the invalids,
with their parasols, had flocked into the arcades.

kitty was walking there with her mother and the moscow colonel, smart
and jaunty in his european coat, bought ready-made at frankfort. they
were walking on one side of the arcade, trying to avoid levin, who was
walking on the other side. varenka, in her dark dress, in a black hat
with a turn-down brim, was walking up and down the whole length of the
arcade with a blind frenchwoman, and, every time she met kitty, they
exchanged friendly glances.

"mamma, couldn’t i speak to her?" said kitty, watchin

friend, and noticing that she was going up to the spring, and that they
might come there together.

"oh, if you want to so much, i’ll find out about her first and make her
acquaintance myself," answered her mother. "what do you see in her out
of the way? a companion, she must be. if you like, i’ll make
acquaintance with madame stahl; i used to know her _belle-soeur_," added
the princess, lifting her head haughtily.

kitty knew that the princess was offended that madame stahl had seemed
to avoid making her acquaintance. kitty did not insist.

"how wonderfully sweet she is!" she said, gazing at varenka just as she
handed a glass to the frenchwoman. "look how natural and sweet it all
is."

"it’s so funny to see your _engouements_," said the princess. "no, we’d
better go back," she added, noticing levin coming towards them with his
companion and a german doctor, to whom he was talking very noisily and
angrily.


 
 ___________________________
 
they turned to go back, when suddenly they heard, not noisy talk, but
shouting. levin, stopping short, was shouting at the doctor, and the
doctor, too, was excited. a crowd gathered about them. the princess and
kitty beat a hasty retreat, while the colonel joined the crowd to find
out what was the matter.

a few minutes later the colonel overtook them.

"what was it?" inquired the princess.

"scandalous and disgraceful!" answered the colonel. "the one thing to be
dreaded is meeting russians abroad. that tall gentleman was abusing the
doctor, flinging all sorts of insults at him because he wasn’t treating
him quite as he liked, and he began waving his stick at him. it’s simply
a scandal!"

"oh, how unple
 
 ___________________________
 
asant!" said the princess. "well, and how did it end?"

"luckily at that point that ... the one in the mushroom hat ...
intervened. a russian lady, i think she is," said the colonel.

"mademoiselle varenka?" asked kitty.

"yes, yes. she came to the rescue before anyone; she took the man by the
arm and led him away."

"there, mamma," said kitty; "you wonder that i’m enthusiastic about
her."

the next day, as she watched her unknown friend, kitty noticed that
mademoiselle varenka was already on the same terms with levin and his
companion as with her other _protégés_. she went up to them, entered
into conversation with them, and served as interpreter for the woman,
who could not speak any foreign language.

kitty began to entreat her mother still more urgently to let her make
friends with varenka. and, disagreeable as it was to the princess to
seem to take the first step in wishing to make the acquaintance of
madame stahl, who thought

d i tried to pacify him, he’s very ill,
and was dissatisfied with the doctor. i’m used to looking after such
invalids."

"yes, i’ve heard you live at mentone with your aunt—i think—madame
stahl: i used to know her _belle-soeur_."

"no, she’s not my aunt. i call her mamma, but i am not related to her; i
was brought up by her," answered varenka, flushing a little again.

this was so simply said, and so sweet was the truthful and candid
expression of her face, that the princess saw why kitty had taken such a
fancy to varenka.

"well, and what’s this levin going to do?" asked the princess.

"he’s going away," answered varenka.

at that instant kitty came up from the spring beaming with delight that
her mother had become acquainted with her unknown friend.

"well, see, kitty, your intense desire to make friends with
mademoiselle. . ."

"varenka," varenka put in smiling, "that’s what everyone calls me."

kitty blushed with pleasure, and slowly, without speaking, pressed her
new

nd liked mademoiselle varenka, as everyone called
her.

having learned all these facts, the princess found nothing to object to
in her daughter’s intimacy with varenka, more especially as varenka’s
breeding and education were of the best—she spoke french and english
extremely well—and what was of the most weight, brought a message from
madame stahl expressing her regret that she was prevented by her ill
health from making the acquaintance of the princess.

after getting to know varenka, kitty became more and more fascinated by
her friend, and every day she discovered new virtues in her.

the princess, hearing that varenka had a good voice, asked her to come
and sing to them in the evening.

"kitty plays, and we have a piano; not a good one, it’s true, but you
will give us so much pleasure," said the princess with her affected
smile, which kitty disliked particularly just then, because she noticed
that varenka had no inclination to sing. varenka came, however, in the
evening and br

ought a roll of music with her. the princess had invited
marya yevgenyevna and her daughter and the colonel.

varenka seemed quite unaffected by there being persons present she did
not know, and she went directly to the piano. she could not accompany
herself, but she could sing music at sight very well. kitty, who played
well, accompanied her.

"you have an extraordinary talent," the princess said to her after
varenka had sung the first song extremely well.

marya yevgenyevna and her daughter expressed their thanks and
admiration.

"look," said the colonel, looking out of the window, "what an audience
has collected to listen to you." there actually was quite a considerable
crowd under the windows.

"i am very glad it gives you pleasure," varenka answered simply.

kitty looked with pride at her frien

d. she was enchanted by her talent,
and her voice, and her face, but most of all by her manner, by the way
varenka obviously thought nothing of her singing and was quite unmoved
by their praises. she seemed only to be asking: "am i to sing again, or
is that enough?"

"if it had been i," thought kitty, "how proud i should have been! how
delighted i should have been to see that crowd under the windows! but
she’s utterly unmoved by it. her only motive is to avoid refusing and to
please mamma. what is there in her? what is it gives her the power to
look down on everything, to be calm independently of everything? how i
should like to know it and to learn it of her!" thought kitty, gazing
into her serene face. the princess asked varenka to sing again, and
varenka sang another song, also smoothl

y, distinctly, and well, standing
erect at the piano and beating time on it with her thin, dark-skinned
hand.

the next song in the book was an italian one. kitty played the opening
bars, and looked round at varenka.

"let’s skip that," said varenka, flushing a little. kitty let her eyes
rest on varenka’s face, with a look of dismay and inquiry.

"very well, the next one," she said hurriedly, turning over the pages,
and at once feeling that there was something connected with the song.

"no," answered varenka with a smile, laying her hand on the music, "no,
let’s have that one." and she sang it just as quietly, as coolly, and as
well as the others.

when she had finished, they all thanked her again, and went off to tea.
kitty and varenka went out into the little

 garden that adjoined the
house.

"am i right, that you have some reminiscences connected with that song?"
said kitty. "don’t tell me," she added hastily, "only say if i’m right."

"no, why not? i’ll tell you simply," said varenka, and, without waiting
for a reply, she went on: "yes, it brings up memories, once painful
ones. i cared for someone once, and i used to sing him that song."

kitty with big, wide-open eyes gazed silently, sympathetically at
varenka.

"i cared for him, and he cared for me; but his mother did not wish it,
and he married another girl. he’s living now not far from us, and i see
him sometimes. you didn’t think i had a love story too," she said, and
there was a faint gleam in her handsome face of that fire which kitty
felt must once have glowed all over her.

"i didn’t think so? why, if i were a man, i could never care for anyone
else after knowing you. o

nly i can’t understand how he could, to please
his mother, forget you and make you unhappy; he had no heart."

"oh, no, he’s a very good man, and i’m not unhappy; quite the contrary,
i’m very happy. well, so we shan’t be singing any more now," she added,
turning towards the house.

"how good you are! how good you are!" cried kitty, and stopping her, she
kissed her. "if i could only be even a little like you!"

"why should you be like anyone? you’re nice as you are," said varenka,
smiling her gentle, weary smile.

"no, i’m not nice at all. come, tell me.... stop a minute, let’s sit
down," said kitty, making her sit down again beside her. "tell me, isn’t
it humiliating to think that a man has disdained your love, that he
hasn’t cared for it?..."

"but he didn’t disdain it; i believe he cared for me, but he was

a
dutiful son..."

"yes, but if it hadn’t been on account of his mother, if it had been his
own doing?..." said kitty, feeling she was giving away her secret, and
that her face, burning with the flush of shame, had betrayed her
already.

"in that case he would have done wrong, and i should not have regretted
him," answered varenka, evidently realizing that they were now talking
not of her, but of kitty.

"but the humiliation," said kitty, "the humiliation one can never
forget, can never forget," she said, remembering her look at the last
ball during the pause in the music.

"where is the humiliation? why, you did nothing wrong?"

"worse than wrong—shameful."

varenka shook her head and laid her hand on kitty’s hand.

"why, what is there shameful?" she said. "you didn’t tell a man, who
didn’t care for you, that you loved him, did you?"

"of course not; i never said a word, but he knew it. no, no, there are
looks, there a

"why so? i don’t understand. the whole point is whether you love him now
or not," said varenka, who called everything by its name.

"i hate him; i can’t forgive myself."

"why, what for?"

"the shame, the humiliation!"

"oh! if everyone were as sensitive as you are!" said varenka. "there
isn’t a girl who hasn’t been through the same. and it’s all so
unimportant."

"why, what is important?" said kitty, looking into her face with
inquisitive wonder.

"oh, there’s so much that’s important," said varenka, smiling.

"why, what?"

"oh, so much that’s more important," answered varenka, not knowing what
to say. but at that instant they heard the princess’s voice from the
window. "kitty, it’s cold! either get a shawl, or come indoors."

"it really is time to go in!" said varenka, getting up. "i have to go on
to madame berthe’s; she asked me to."

kitty held her by the hand, and with pass

ionate curiosity and entreaty
her eyes asked her: "what is it, what is this of such importance that
gives you such tranquillity? you know, tell me!" but varenka did not
even know what kitty’s eyes were asking her. she merely thought that she
had to go to see madame berthe too that evening, and to make haste home
in time for _maman’s_ tea at twelve o’clock. she went indoors, collected
her music, and saying good-bye to everyone, was about to go.

"allow me to see you home," said the colonel.

"yes, how can you go alone at night like this?" chimed in the princess.
"anyway, i’ll send parasha."

kitty saw that varenka could hardly restrain a smile at the idea that
she needed an

 escort.

"no, i always go about alone and nothing ever happens to me," she said,
taking her hat. and kissing kitty once more, without saying what was
important, she stepped out courageously with the music under her arm and
vanished into the twilight of the summer night, bearing away with her
her secret of what was important and what gave her the calm and dignity
so much to be envied.



chapter 33


kitty made the acquaintance of madame stahl too, and this acquaintance,
together with her friendship with varenka, did not merely exercise a
great influence on her, it also comforted her in her mental distress.
she found this comfort through a completely new world being opened to
her by means of this acquaintance, a world having nothing in common with
her past, an exalted, noble world, from the height of which she could
contemplate her past calmly. it was revealed to her that besides the
instinctive 
 
 ___________________________
 
life to which kitty had given herself up hitherto there was
a spiritual life. this life was disclosed in religion, but a religion
having nothing in common with that one which kitty had known from
childhood, and which found expression in litanies and all-night services
at the widow’s home, where one might meet one’s friends, and in learning
by heart slavonic texts with the priest. this was a lofty, mysterious
religion connected with a whole series of noble thoughts and feelings,
which one could do more than merely believe because one was told to,
which one could love.

kitty found all this out not from words. madame stahl talked to kitty as
to a charming child that one
 
 ___________________________
 
 looks on with pleasure as on the memory of
one’s youth, and only once she said in passing that in all human sorrows
nothing gives comfort but love and faith, and that in the sight of
christ’s compassion for us no sorrow is trifling—and immediately talked
of other things. but in every gesture of madame stahl, in every word, in
every heavenly—as kitty called it—look, and above all in the whole story
of her life, which she heard from varenka, kitty recognized that
something "that was important," of which, till then, she had known
nothing.

yet, elevated as madame stahl’s character was, touching as was her
story, and exalted and moving as was her speech, kitty could not help
detecting in her some traits which perplexed her. she noticed that when
questioning her about her family, madame stahl had smiled
contemptuously, which was not in accord with christian meekness. she
noticed, too, that when she had found a catholic priest with her, ma
 
 ___________________________
 
dame
stahl had studiously kept her face in the shadow of the lamp-shade and
had smiled in a peculiar way. trivial as these two observations were,
they perplexed her, and she had her doubts as to madame stahl. but on
the other hand varenka, alone in the world, without friends or
relations, with a melancholy disappointment in the past, desiring
nothing, regretting nothing, was just that perfection of which kitty
dared hardly dream. in varenka she realized that one has but to forget
oneself and love others, and one will be calm, happy, and noble. and
that was what kitty longed to be. seeing now clearly what was _the most
important_, kitty was not satisfied with being enthusiastic over it; she
at once gave herself up with her whole soul to the new life that was
opening to her. from varenka’s accounts of the doings of madame stahl
and other people whom she mentioned, kitty had already constructed the
pl

an of her own future life. she would, like madame stahl’s niece,
aline, of whom varenka had talked to her a great deal, seek out those
who were in trouble, wherever she might be living, help them as far as
she could, give them the gospel, read the gospel to the sick, to
criminals, to the dying. the idea of reading the gospel to criminals, as
aline did, particularly fascinated kitty. but all these were secret
dreams, of which kitty did not talk either to her mother or to varenka.

while awaiting the time for carrying out her plans on a large scale,
however, kitty, even then at the springs, where there were so many
people ill and unhappy, readily found a chance for practicing her new
principles in imitation of varenka.

at first the princess noticed nothing but that kitty was much under the
influence of her _engouement_, as she called it, for madame stahl, and
still more for varenka. she saw that kitty did not merely imita

te
varenka in her conduct, but unconsciously imitated her in her manner of
walking, of talking, of blinking her eyes. but later on the princess
noticed that, apart from this adoration, some kind of serious spiritual
change was taking place in her daughter.

the princess saw that in the evenings kitty read a french testament that
madame stahl had given her—a thing she had never done before; that she
avoided society acquaintances and associated with the sick people who
were under varenka’s protection, and especially one poor family, that of
a sick painter, petrov. kitty was unmistakably proud of playing the part
of a sister of mercy in that family. all this was well enough, and the
princess had nothing to say against it, especially as petrov’s wife was
a perfectly nice sort of woman, an

d that the german princess, noticing
kitty’s devotion, praised her, calling her an angel of consolation. all
this would have been very well, if there had been no exaggeration. but
the princess saw that her daughter was rushing into extremes, and so
indeed she told her.

"_il ne faut jamais rien outrer_," she said to her.

her daughter made her no reply, only in her heart she thought that one
could not talk about exaggeration where christianity was concerned. what
exaggeration could there be in the practice of a doctrine wherein one
wa
 
 ___________________________
 
s bidden to turn the other cheek when one was smitten, and give one’s
cloak if one’s coat were taken? but the princess disliked this
exaggeration, and disliked even more the fact that she felt her daughter
did not care to show her all her heart. kitty did in fact conceal her
new views and feelings from her mother. she concealed them not because
she did not respect or did not love her mother, but simply because she
was her mother. she would have revealed them to anyone sooner than to
her mother.

"how is it anna pavlovna’s not been to see us for so long?" the princess
said one day of madame petrova. "i’ve asked her, but she seems put out
about something."

"no, i’ve not noticed it, maman," said kitty, flushing hotly.

"is it long since 
 
 ___________________________
 
you went to see them?"

"we’re meaning to make an expedition to the mountains tomorrow,"
answered kitty.

"well, you can go," answered the princess, gazing at her daughter’s
embarrassed face and trying to guess the cause of her embarrassment.

that day varenka came to dinner and told them that anna pavlovna had
changed her mind and given up the expedition for the morrow. and the
princess noticed again that kitty reddened.

"kitty, haven’t you had some misunderstanding with the petrovs?" said
the princess, when they were left alone. "why has she given up sending
the children and coming to see us?"

kitty answered that nothing had happened between them, and that she
could not tell why anna pavlovna seemed displeased with her. kitty
answered perfectly truly. she did not know the reason anna pavlovna had
changed to her, but she guessed it. she guessed at something which she
could not tell her mother, which she did not put
 
 ___________________________
 
 can never speak
of even to oneself, so terrible and shameful would it be to be mistaken.

again and again she went over in her memory all her relations with the
family. she remembered the simple delight expressed on the round,
good-humored face of anna pavlovna at their meetings; she remembered
their secret confabulations about the invalid, their plots to draw him
away from the work which was forbidden him, and to get him out-of-doors;
the devotion of the youngest boy, who used to call her "my kitty," and
would not go to bed without her. how nice it all was! then she recalled
the thin, terribly thin figure of petrov, with his long neck, in his
brown coat, his scant, curly hair, his questioning blue eyes that were
so terrible to kitty at first, and his painful attempts to seem hearty
and lively in her presence. she recalled the efforts she had made at
first to overcome the repugnance she felt for him, as for all
consumptive people, and the pains it had cost her to think of things to
say to 
 
 ___________________________
 
him. she recalled the timid, softened look with which he gazed at
her, and the strange feeling of compassion and awkwardness, and later of
a sense of her own goodness, which she had felt at it. how nice it all
was! but all that was at first. now, a few days ago, everything was
suddenly spoiled. anna pavlovna had met kitty with affected cordiality,
and had kept continual watch on her and on her husband.

could that touching pleasure he showed when she came near be the cause
of anna pavlovna’s coolness?

"yes," she mused, "there was something unnatural about anna pavlovna,
and utterly unlike her good nature, when she said angrily the day before
yesterday: ‘there, he will keep waiting for you; he wouldn’t drink his
coffee without you, though he’s grown so dreadfully weak.’"

"yes, perhaps, too, she didn

t like it when i gave him the rug. it was
all so simple, but he took it so awkwardly, and was so long thanking me,
that i felt awkward too. and then that portrait of me he did so well.
and most of all that look of confusion and tenderness! yes, yes, that’s
it!" kitty repeated to herself with horror. "no, it can’t be, it
oughtn’t to be! he’s so much to be pitied!" she said to herself directly
after.

this doubt poisoned the charm of her new life.



chapter 34


before the end of the course of drinking the waters, prince
shtcherbatsky, who had gone on from carlsbad to baden and kissingen to
russian friends—to get a breath of russian air, as he said—came back to
his wife and daughter.

the views of the prince and of the princess on life abroad were

ot—for the simple
reason that she was a typical russian gentlewoman; and so she was
affected, which did not altogether suit her. the prince, on the
contrary, thought everything foreign detestable, got sick of european
life, kept to his russian habits, and purposely tried to show himself
abroad less european than he was in reality.

the prince returned thinner, with the skin hanging in loose bags on his
cheeks, but in the most cheerful frame of mind. his good humor was even
greater when he saw kitty completely recovered. the news of kitty’s
friendship with madame stahl and varenka, and the reports the princess
gave him of some kind of change she had noticed in kitty, troubled the
prince and aroused his habitual feeling of jealousy of everything that
drew his daughter away from him, and a dread that his daughter might
have got out of the reach of his influence into regions inaccessible to
him. but these unpleasant matters were all drowned in the sea of
kindliness and good humor which was

kles and baggy cheeks propped up by a starched collar, set
off with his daughter to the spring in the greatest good humor.

it was a lovely morning: the bright, cheerful houses with their little
gardens, the sight of the red-faced, red-armed, beer-drinking german
waitresses, working away merrily, did the heart good. but the nearer
they got to the springs the oftener they met sick people; and their
appearance seemed more pitiable than ever among the everyday conditions
of prosperous german life. kitty was no longer struck by this contrast.
the bright sun, the brilliant green of the foliage, the strains of the
music were for her the natural setting of all these familiar faces, with
their changes to greater emaciation or to convalescence, for which she
watched. but to the prince the brightness and gaiety of the june
morning, and the sound of the orchestra playing a gay waltz then in
fashion, and above all, the appearance of the healthy attendants, seemed
something unseemly and monstrous, in co

gether from all parts of europe. in
spite of his feeling of pride and, as it were, of the return of youth,
with his favorite daughter on his arm, he felt awkward, and almost
ashamed of his vigorous step and his sturdy, stout limbs. he felt almost
like a man not dressed in a crowd.

"present me to your new friends," he said to his daughter, squeezing her
hand with his elbow. "i like even your horrid soden for making you so
well again. only it’s melancholy, very melancholy here. who’s that?"

kitty mentioned the names of all the people they met, with some of whom
she was acquainted and some not. at the entrance of the garden they met
the blind lady, madame berthe, with her guide, and the prince was
delighted to see the old frenchwoman’s face light up when she heard
kitty’s voice. she at once began talking to him with french exaggerated
politeness, applauding him for having such a delightful daughter,
extolling kitty to the skies before her face, and calling her a
treasure, a pearl, an

d a consoling angel.

"well, she’s the second angel, then," said the prince, smiling. "she
calls mademoiselle varenka angel number one."

"oh! mademoiselle varenka, she’s a real angel, allez," madame berthe
assented.

in the arcade they met varenka herself. she was walking rapidly towards
them carrying an elegant red bag.

"here is papa come," kitty said to her.

varenka made—simply and naturally as she did everything—a movement
between a bow and a curtsey, and immediately began talking to the
prince, without shyness, naturally, as she talked to everyone.

"of course i know you; i know you very well," the prince said to her
with a smile, in which kitty detected with joy that her father liked her
friend. "where are you off to in such haste?"

"maman’s here," she said, turning to kitty. "she has not slept all
night, and the doctor advi

sed her to go out. i’m taking her her work."

"so that’s angel number one?" said the prince when varenka had gone on.

kitty saw that her father had meant to make fun of varenka, but that he
could not do it because he liked her.

"come, so we shall see all your friends," he went on, "even madame
stahl, if she deigns to recognize me."

"why, did you know her, papa?" kitty asked apprehensively, catching the
gleam of irony that kindled in the prince’s eyes at the mention of
madame stahl.

"i used to know her husband, and her too a little, before she’d joined
the pietists."

"what is a pietist, papa?" asked kitty, dismayed to find that what she
prized so highly in madame stahl had a name.

"i don’t quite know myself. i only know that she thanks god for
everything, for every misfortune, and thanks god too that her husband
died. and that’s rather droll, as th

ey didn’t get on together."

"who’s that? what a piteous face!" he asked, noticing a sick man of
medium height sitting on a bench, wearing a brown overcoat and white
trousers that fell in strange folds about his long, fleshless legs. this
man lifted his straw hat, showed his scanty curly hair and high
forehead, painfully reddened by the pressure of the hat.

"that’s petrov, an artist," answered kitty, blushing. "and that’s his
wife," she added, indicating anna pavlovna, who, as though on purpose,
at the very instant they approached walked away after a child that had
run off along a path.

"poor fellow! and what a nice face he has!" said the prince. "why don’t
you go up to him? he wanted to speak to you."

"well, let us go, then," said kitty, turning round resolutely. "how are
you feeling today?" she asked petrov.

petrov got up, leaning on his stick, and looked shyly at the prince.

"th
 
 ___________________________
 
is is my daughter," said the prince. "let me introduce myself."

the painter bowed and smiled, showing his strangely dazzling white
teeth.

"we expected you yesterday, princess," he said to kitty. he staggered as
he said this, and then repeated the motion, trying to make it seem as if
it had been intentional.

"i meant to come, but varenka said that anna pavlovna sent word you were
not going."

"not going!" said petrov, blushing, and immediately beginning to cough,
and his eyes sought his wife. "anita! anita!" he said loudly, and the
swollen veins stood out like cords on his thin white neck.

anna pavlovna came up.

"so you sent word to the princess that we weren’t going!" he whispere
 
 ___________________________
 
 send word to the princess that we weren’t going for?" the
artist whispered hoarsely once more, still more angrily, obviously
exasperated that his voice failed him so that he could not give his
words the expression he would have liked to.

"oh, mercy on us! i thought we weren’t going," his wife answered
crossly.

"what, when...." he coughed and waved his hand. the prince took off his
hat and moved away with his daughter.

"ah! ah!" he sighed deeply. "oh, poor things!"

"yes, papa," answered kitty. "and you must know they’ve three children,
no servant, and scarcely any means. he gets something from the academy,"
she went on briskly, trying to drown the distress that the queer change
in anna pavlovna’s manner to her had aroused in her.

"oh, here’s madame stahl," said kitty, indicating an invalid carriage,
where, propped on pillows, something in gray and blue was lying under a
sunshade. this was madame stahl. behind her stood the gloomy,
healthy-looking german workman who pushed the
 
 ___________________________
 
 carriage. close by was
standing a flaxen-headed swedish count, whom kitty knew by name. several
invalids were lingering near the low carriage, staring at the lady as
though she were some curiosity.

the prince went up to her, and kitty detected that disconcerting gleam
of irony in his eyes. he went up to madame stahl, and addressed her with
extreme courtesy and affability in that excellent french that so few
speak nowadays.

"i don’t know if you remember me, but i must recall myself to thank you
for your kindness to my daughter," he said, taking off his hat and not
putting it on again.

"prince alexander shtcherbatsky," said madame stahl, lifting upon him
her heavenly eyes, in which kitty discerned a look of annoyance.
"del

ow colonel said with ironical
intention. he cherished a grudge against madame stahl for not making his
acquaintance.

"she’s just the same," replied the prince.

"did you know her before her illness, prince—that’s to say before she
took to her bed?"

"yes. she took to her bed before my eyes," said the prince.

"they say it’s ten years since she has stood on her feet."

"she doesn’t stand up because her legs are too short. she’s a very bad
figure."

"papa, it’s not possible!" cried kitty.

"that’s what wicked tongues say, my darling. and your varenka catches it
too," he added. "oh, these invalid ladies!"

"oh, no, papa!" kitty objected warmly. "varenka worships her. and then
she does so much good! ask anyone! everyone knows her and aline stahl."

"perhaps so," said the prince, squeezing her hand with his elbow; "but
it’s better when one does good so that you may ask everyone and no one
knows."

kitty did not answer, not because she had nothing to say, but because
she did no

o her inmost
sanctuary, she felt that the heavenly image of madame stahl, which she
had carried for a whole month in her heart, had vanished, never to
return, just as the fantastic figure made up of some clothes thrown down
at random vanishes when one sees that it is only some garment lying
there. all that was left was a woman with short legs, who lay down
because she had a bad figure, and worried patient varenka for not
arranging her rug to her liking. and by no effort of the imagination
could kitty bring back the former madame stahl.



chapter 35


the prince communicated his good humor to his own family and his
friends, and even to the german landlord in whose rooms the
shtcherbatskys were staying.

on coming back with kitty from the springs, the prince, who had asked
the colonel, and marya yevgenyevna, and varenka all to come and have
coffee with them, gave orders for a table and chairs to be taken into
the garden under the chestnut tree, and lunch to be laid there. the
landlord and th

a high cap with lilac ribbons, distributing cups and bread-and-butter.
at the other end sat the prince, eating heartily, and talking loudly and
merrily. the prince had spread out near him his purchases, carved boxes,
and knick-knacks, paper-knives of all sorts, of which he bought a heap
at every watering-place, and bestowed them upon everyone, including
lieschen, the servant girl, and the landlord, with whom he jested in his
comically bad german, assuring him that it was not the water had cured
kitty, but his splendid cookery, especially his plum soup. the princess
laughed at her husband for his russian ways, but she was more lively and
good-humored than she had been all the while she had been at the waters.
the colonel smiled, as he always did, at the prince’s jokes, but as far
as regards europe, of which he believed himself to be making a careful
study, he took the princess’s side. the simple-hearted marya yevgenyevna
simply roared with laughter at everything absurd the prince said, a

nd
his jokes made varenka helpless with feeble but infectious laughter,
which was something kitty had never seen before.

kitty was glad of all this, but she could not be light-hearted. she
could not solve the problem her father had unconsciously set her by his
goodhumored view of her friends, and of the life that had so attracted
her. to this doubt there was joined the change in her relations with the
petrovs, which had been so conspicuously and unpleasantly marked that
morning. everyone was good humored, but kitty could not feel good
humored, and this increased her distress. she felt a feeling such as she
had known in

," said the colonel.

"time, indeed, that depends! why, there’s time one would give a month of
for sixpence, and time you wouldn’t give half an hour of for any money.
isn’t that so, katinka? what is it? why are you so depressed?"

"i’m not depressed."

"where are you off to? stay a little longer," he said to varenka.

"i must be going home," said varenka, getting up, and again she went off
into a giggle. when she had recovered, she said good-bye, and went into
the house to get her hat.

kitty followed her. even varenka struck her as different. she was not
worse, but different from what she had fancied her before.

"oh, dear! it’s a long while since i’ve laughed so much!" said varenka,
gathering up her parasol and her bag. "how nice he is, your father!"

kitty did not speak.

"when shall i see you again?" asked varenka.

"mamma meant to go and see the petrovs. won’t you be there?" said kitty,
to try varenka.

"yes," answered varenka. "they’re getting ready to go away, so i
pr

omised to help them pack."

"well, i’ll come too, then."

"no, why should you?"

"why not? why not? why not?" said kitty, opening her eyes wide, and
clutching at varenka’s parasol, so as not to let her go. "no, wait a
minute; why not?"

"oh, nothing; your father has come, and besides, they will feel awkward
at your helping."

"no, tell me why you don’t want me to be often at the petrovs’. you
don’t want me to—why not?"

"i didn’t say that," said varenka quietly.

"no, please tell me!"

"tell you everything?" asked varenka.

"everything, everything!" kitty assented.

"well, there’s really nothing of 
 
 ___________________________
 
any consequence; only that mihail
alexeyevitch" (that was the artist’s name) "had meant to leave earlier,
and now he doesn’t want to go away," said varenka, smiling.

"well, well!" kitty urged impatiently, looking darkly at varenka.

"well, and for some reason anna pavlovna told him that he didn’t want to
go because you are here. of course, that was nonsense; but there was a
dispute over it—over you. you know how irritable these sick people are."

kitty, scowling more than ever, kept silent, and varenka went on
speaking alone, trying to soften or soothe her, and seeing a storm
coming—she did not know whether of tears or of words.

"so you’d better not go.... you understand; you won’t be offended?..."

"and it serves me right! and it serves me right!" kitty cried quickly,
snatching the parasol out of varenka’s hand, and looking past her
friend’s face.

varenka felt inclined to smile, looking at her childish fury, but she
was afraid of

a sham!..."

"a sham! with what object?" said varenka gently.

"oh, it’s so idiotic! so hateful! there was no need whatever for me....
nothing but sham!" she said, opening and shutting the parasol.

"but with what object?"

"to seem better to people, to myself, to god; to deceive everyone. no!
now i won’t descend to that. i’ll be bad; but anyway not a liar, a
cheat."

"but who is a cheat?" said varenka reproachfully. "you speak as if..."

but kitty was in one of her gusts of fury, and she would not let her
finish.

"i don’t talk about you, not about you at all. you’re perfection. yes,
yes, i know you’re all perfection; but what am i to do if i’m bad? this
would never have been if i weren’t bad. so let me be what i am. i won’t
be a sham. what have i to do with anna pavlovna? let them go their way,
and me go mine. i can’t be different.... and yet it’s not that, it’s not
that."

"what is not that?" asked varenka in bewilder

ment.

"everything. i can’t act except from the heart, and you act from
principle. i liked you simply, but you most likely only wanted to save
me, to improve me."

"you are unjust," said varenka.

"but i’m not speaking of other people, i’m speaking of myself."

"kitty," they heard her mother’s voice, "come here, show papa your
necklace."

kitty, with a haughty air, without making peace with her friend, took
the necklace in a little box from the table and went to her mother.

"what’s the matter? why are you so red?" her mother and father said to
her with one voice.

"nothing," she answered. "i’ll be back directly," and she ran back.

"she’s still here," she thought. "what am i to say to her? oh, dear!
what have i done, what have i said? why was i rude to her? what am i to
do? what am i to say to her?" thought kitty, and she stopp

doorway.

varenka in her hat and with the parasol in her hands was sitting at the
table examining the spring which kitty had broken. she lifted her head.

"varenka, forgive me, do forgive me," whispered kitty, going up to her.
"i don’t remember what i said. i..."

"i really didn’t mean to hurt you," said varenka, smiling.

peace was made. but with her father’s coming all the world in which she
had been living was transformed for kitty. she did not give up
everything she had learned, but she became aware that she had deceived
herself in supposing she could be what she wanted to be. her eyes were,
it seemed, opened; she felt all the difficulty of maintaining herself
without hypocrisy and self-conceit on the pinnacle to which she had
wished to mount. moreover, she became aware of all the dreariness of the
world of sorrow, of sick and dying people, in which she had been living.
the efforts she had made to like it seemed to her i

ntolerable, and she
felt a longing to get back quickly into the fresh air, to russia, to
ergushovo, where, as she knew from letters, her sister dolly had already
gone with her children.

but her affection for varenka did not wane. as she said good-bye, kitty
begged her to come to them in russia.

"i’ll come when you get married," said varenka.

"i shall never marry."

"well, then, i shall never come."

"well, then, i shall be married simply for that. mind now, remember your
promise," said kitty.

the doctor’s prediction was fulfilled. kitty returned home to russia
cured. she was not so gay and thoughtless as before, but she was serene.
her moscow troubles had become a memory to her.




part three



chapter 1


sergey ivanovitch koznishev wanted a rest from mental work, and instead

enses, and it left him more at liberty. darya alexandrovna regarded
staying in the country for the summer as essential for the children,
especially for the little girl, who had not succeeded in regaining her
strength after the scarlatina, and also as a means of escaping the petty
humiliations, the little bills owing to the wood-merchant, the
fishmonger, the shoemaker, which made her miserable. besides this, she
was pleased to go away to the country because she was dreaming of
getting her sister kitty to stay with her there. kitty was to be back
from abroad in the middle of the summer, and bathing had been prescribed
for her. kitty wrote that no prospect was so alluring as to spend the
summer with dolly at ergushovo, full of childish associations for both
of them.

the first days of her existence in the country were very hard for dolly.
she used to stay in the country as a child, and the impression she had
retained of it was that the country was a refuge from all the
unpleasantness of the to

 she watched him.

here, in the country, with children, and with darya alexandrovna, with
whom he was in sympathy, levin was in a mood not infrequent with him, of
childlike light-heartedness that she particularly liked in him. as he
ran with the children, he taught them gymnastic feats, set miss hoole
laughing with his queer english accent, and talked to darya alexandrovna
of his pursuits in the country.

after dinner, darya alexandrovna, sitting alone with him on the balcony,
began to speak of kitty.

"you know, kitty’s coming here, and is going to spend the summer with
me."

"really," he said, flushing, and at once, to change the conversation, he
said: "then i’ll send you two cows, shall i? if you insist on a bill you
shall pay me five roubles a month; but it’s really too bad of you."

"no, thank you. we can manage very well now."

"oh, well, then, i’ll have a look at your cows, and if you’ll allow me,
i’ll give directions about their food. everything depends on their
food."


 
 ___________________________
 
and levin, to turn the conversation, explained to darya alexandrovna the
theory of cow-keeping, based on the principle that the cow is simply a
machine for the transformation of food into milk, and so on.

he talked of this, and passionately longed to hear more of kitty, and,
at the same time, was afraid of hearing it. he dreaded the breaking up
of the inward peace he had gained with such effort.

"yes, but still all this has to be looked after, and who is there to
look after it?" darya alexandrovna responded, without interest.

she had by now got her household matters so satisfactorily arranged,
thanks to marya philimonovna, that she was disinclined to make any
change in them; besides, she had no faith in levin’s knowledge of
farming. general principles, as

on with suspicion. it seemed to her that
such principles could only be a hindrance in farm management. it all
seemed to her a far simpler matter: all that was needed, as marya
philimonovna had explained, was to give brindle and whitebreast more
food and drink, and not to let the cook carry all the kitchen slops to
the laundry maid’s cow. that was clear. but general propositions as to
feeding on meal and on grass were doubtful and obscure. and, what was
most important, she wanted to talk about kitty.



chapter 10


"kitty writes to me that there’s nothing she longs for so much as quiet
and solitude," dolly said after the silence that had followed.

"and how is she—better?" levin asked in agitation.

"thank god, she’s quite well again. i never believed her lungs were
affected."

"oh, i’m very glad!" said levin, and dolly fancied she saw something
touching, helpless, in his face as he said this and looked silently into
her face.

"let me ask you, konstantin dmitrievitch," said darya

 alexandrovna,
smiling her kindly and rather mocking smile, "why is it you are angry
with kitty?"

"i? i’m not angry with her," said levin.

"yes, you are angry. why was it you did not come to see us nor them when
you were in moscow?"

"darya alexandrovna," he said, blushing up to the roots of his hair, "i
wonder really that with your kind heart you don’t feel this. how it is
you feel no pity for me, if nothing else, when you know..."

"what do i know?"

"you know i made an offer and that i was refused," said levin, and all
the tenderness he had been feeling for kitty a minute before

 and the dead
thing that had come to life within him died again, and only weighed on
his heart and set it aching.

"darya alexandrovna," he said, "that’s how one chooses a new dress or
some purchase or other, not love. the choice has been made, and so much
the better.... and there can be no repeating it."

"ah, pride, pride!" said darya alexandrovna, as though despising him for
the baseness of this feeling in comparison with that other feeling which
only women know. "at the time when you made kitty an offer she was just
in a position in which she could not answer. she was in doubt. doubt
between you and vronsky. him she was seeing every day, and you she had
not seen for a long while. supposing she had been older ... i, for
instance, in her place could have felt no doubt. i always disliked him,
and so it has turned out."

levin recalled kitty’s answer. she had said: "_no, that cannot be_..."

"darya alexandrovna," he said dryly, "i appreciate your confidence in
me; i believe you are maki

 said levin, jumping up. "if you only knew how you are
hurting me. it’s just as if a child of yours were dead, and they were to
say to you: he would have been like this and like that, and he might
have lived, and how happy you would have been in him. but he’s dead,
dead, dead!..."

"how absurd you are!" said darya alexandrovna, looking with mournful
tenderness at levin’s excitement. "yes, i see it all more and more
clearly," she went on musingly. "so you won’t come to see us, then, when
kitty’s here?"

"no, i shan’t come. of course i won’t avoid meeting katerina
alexandrovna, but as far as i can, i will try to save her the annoyance
of my presence."

"you are very, very absurd," repeated darya alexandrovna, looking with
tenderness into his face. "very well then, let it be as though we had
not spoken of this. what have you come for, tanya?" she said in french
to the little girl who had come in.

"where’s my spade, mamma?"

"i speak french, and you must too."

and thought, full of a
subtle, complex inner life, that was remote from levin, she was gazing
beyond him at the glow of the sunrise.

at the very instant when this apparition was vanishing, the truthful
eyes glanced at him. she recognized him, and her face lighted up with
wondering delight.

he could not be mistaken. there were no other eyes like those in the
world. there was only one creature in the world that could concentrate
for him all the brightness and meaning of life. it was she. it was
kitty. he understood that she was driving to ergushovo from the railway
station. and everything that had been stirring levin during that
sleepless night, all the resolutions he had made, all vanished at once.
he recalled with horror his dreams of marrying a peasant girl. there
only, in the carriage that had crossed over to the other side of the
road, and was rapidly disappearing, there only could he find the
solution of the riddle of his life, which had weighed so agonizingly
upon him of late.

before,
levin had felt dissatisfaction with his own position in regard to the
land. he saw where his boat leaked, but he did not look for the leak,
perhaps purposely deceiving himself. (nothing would be left him if he
lost faith in it.) but now he could deceive himself no longer. the
farming of the land, as he was managing it, had become not merely
unattractive but revolting to him, and he could take no further interest
in it.

to this now was joined the presence, only twenty-five miles off, of
kitty shtcherbatskaya, whom he longed to see and could not see. darya
alexandrovna oblonskaya had invited him, when he was over there, to
come; to come with the object of renewing his offer to her sister, who
would, so she gave him to understand, accept him now. levin himself had
felt on seeing kitty shtcherbatskaya that he had never ceased to love
her; but he could not go over to the oblonskys’, knowing she was there.
the fact that he had made her an offer, and she had refused him, had
placed an i

showing that i know what she told me? and me to go magnanimously to
forgive her, and have pity on her! me go through a performance before
her of forgiving, and deigning to bestow my love on her!... what induced
darya alexandrovna to tell me that? by chance i might have seen her,
then everything would have happened of itself; but, as it is, it’s out
of the question, out of the question!"

darya alexandrovna sent him a letter, asking him for a side-saddle for
kitty’s use. "i’m told you have a side-saddle," she wrote to him; "i
hope you will bring it over yourself."

this was more than he could stand. how could a woman of any
intelligence, of any delicacy, put her sister in such a humiliating
position! he wrote ten notes, and tore them all up, and sent the saddle
without any reply. to write that he would go was impossible, because he
could not go; to write that he could not come because something
prevented him, or that he would be away, that was still

liked very much, lived in his house; and levin knew that sviazhsky and
his wife would have greatly liked to marry the girl to him. he knew this
with certainty, as so-called eligible young men always know it, though
he could never have brought himself to speak of it to anyone; and he
knew too that, although he wanted to get married, and although by every
token this very attractive girl would make an excellent wife, he could
no more have married her, even if he had not been in love with kitty
shtcherbatskaya, than he could have flown up to the sky. and this
knowledge poisoned the pleasure he had hoped to find in the visit to
sviazhsky.

on getting sviazhsky’s letter with the invitation for shooting, levin
had immediately thought of this; but in spite of it he had made up his
mind that sviazhsky’s having such views for him was simply his own
groundless supposition, and so he would go, all the same. besides, at
the bottom of his heart he had a desire to try himself, put himself to

e to go. but he had not time to write it down, for
the head peasants had come round, and levin went out into the hall to
them.

after his levee, that is to say, giving directions about the labors of
the next day, and seeing all the peasants who had business with him,
levin went back to his study and sat down to work.

laska lay under the table; agafea mihalovna settled herself in her place
with her stocking.

after writing for a little while, levin suddenly thought with
exceptional vividness of kitty, her refusal, and their last meeting. he
got up and began walking about the room.

"what’s the use of being dreary?" said agafea mihalovna. "come, why do
you stay on at home? you ought to go to some warm springs, especially
now you’re ready for the journey."

"well, i am going away the day after tomorrow, agafea mihalovna; i must
finish my work."

"there, there, your work, you say! as if you hadn’t done enough for the
peasants! why, as ’tis, they’re saying, ‘your master will be gett

quivered. these were the only words that had been spoken sincerely
between them. levin knew that those words meant, "you see, and you know,
that i’m in a bad way, and maybe we shall not see each other again."
levin knew this, and the tears gushed from his eyes. he kissed his
brother once more, but he could not speak, and knew not what to say.

three days after his brother’s departure, levin too set off for his
foreign tour. happening to meet shtcherbatsky, kitty’s cousin, in the
railway train, levin greatly astonished him by his depression.

"what’s the matter with you?" shtcherbatsky asked him.

"oh, nothing; there’s not much happiness in life."

"not much? you come with me to paris instead of to mulhausen. you shall
see how to be happy."

"no, i’ve done with it all. it’s time i was dead."

"well, that’s a good one!" said shtcherbatsky, laughing; "why, i’m only
just getting ready to begin."

"yes, i thought the same not long ago, but now

 and his brother-in-law,
karenin, whom he must see, so as to be sure of bringing him to dinner.

stepan arkadyevitch liked dining, but still better he liked to give a
dinner, small, but very choice, both as regards the food and drink and
as regards the selection of guests. he particularly liked the program of
that day’s dinner. there would be fresh perch, asparagus, and _la pièce
de resistance_—first-rate, but quite plain, roast beef, and wines to
suit: so much for the eating and drinking. kitty and levin would be of
the party, and that this might not be obtrusively evident, there would
be a girl cousin too, and young shtcherbatsky, and _la pièce de
resistance_ among the guests—sergey koznishev and alexey alexandrovitch.
sergey ivanovitch was a moscow man, and a philosopher; alexey
alexandrovitch a petersburger, and a practical politician. he was
asking, too, the well-known eccentric enthusiast, pestsov, a liberal, a
great talker, a musician, an historian, and the most delightfully

"on the contrary, the finish is always the best. but i must be going,"
said stepan arkadyevitch, getting up for the tenth time.

"oh, no, stay a bit!" said levin, keeping him. "now, when shall we see
each other again? i’m going tomorrow."

"i’m a nice person! why, that’s just what i came for! you simply must
come to dinner with us today. your brother’s coming, and karenin, my
brother-in-law."

"you don’t mean to say he’s here?" said levin, and he wanted to inquire
about kitty. he had heard at the beginning of the winter that she was at
petersburg with her sister, the wife of the diplomat, and he did not
know whether she had come back or not; but he changed his mind and did
not ask. "whether she’s coming or not, i don’t care," he said to
himself.

"so you’ll come?"

"of course."

"at five o’clock, then, and not evening dress."

and stepan arkadyevitch got up and went down below to the new head of
his department. instinct had not misled stepan arkadyevitch. th

al shade of opinion. and since no difference is less easily
overcome than the difference of opinion about semi-abstract questions,
they never agreed in any opinion, and had long, indeed, been accustomed
to jeer without anger, each at the other’s incorrigible aberrations.

they were just going in at the door, talking of the weather, when stepan
arkadyevitch overtook them. in the drawing room there were already
sitting prince alexander dmitrievitch shtcherbatsky, young
shtcherbatsky, turovtsin, kitty, and karenin.

stepan arkadyevitch saw immediately that things were not going well in
the drawing-room without him. darya alexandrovna, in her best gray silk
gown, obviously worried about the children, who were to have their
dinner by themselves in the nursery, and by her husband’s absence, was
not equal to the task of making the party mix without him. all were
sitting like so many priests’ wives on a visit (so the old prince
expressed it), obviously wondering why they were there, and pumpi

y a fish out of water, and the smile with which his thick
lips greeted stepan arkadyevitch said, as plainly as words: "well, old
boy, you have popped me down in a learned set! a drinking party now, or
the _château des fleurs_, would be more in my line!" the old prince sat
in silence, his bright little eyes watching karenin from one side, and
stepan arkadyevitch saw that he had already formed a phrase to sum up
that politician of whom guests were invited to partake as though he were
a sturgeon. kitty was looking at the door, calling up all her energies
to keep her from blushing at the entrance of konstantin levin. young
shtcherbatsky, who had not been introduced to karenin, was trying to
look as though he were not in the least conscious of it. karenin himself
had followed the petersburg fashion for a dinner with ladies and was
wearing evening dress and a white tie. stepan arkadyevitch saw by his
face that he had come simply to keep his promise, and was performing a
disagreeable duty in bein

t he had been detained by that prince, who was always the scapegoat
for all his absences and unpunctualities, and in one moment he had made
all the guests acquainted with each other, and, bringing together alexey
alexandrovitch and sergey koznishev, started them on a discussion of the
russification of poland, into which they immediately plunged with
pestsov. slapping turovtsin on the shoulder, he whispered something
comic in his ear, and set him down by his wife and the old prince. then
he told kitty she was looking very pretty that evening, and presented
shtcherbatsky to karenin. in a moment he had so kneaded together the
social dough that the drawing room became very lively, and there was a
merry buzz of voices. konstantin levin was the only person who had not
arrived. but this was so much the better, as going into the dining room,
stepan arkadyevitch found to his horror that the port and sherry had
been procured from deprè, and not from levy, and, directing that the
coachman should be s

ent off as speedily as possible to levy’s, he was
going back to the drawing room.

in the dining room he was met by konstantin levin.

"i’m not late?"

"you can never help being late!" said stepan arkadyevitch, taking his
arm.

"have you a lot of people? who’s here?" asked levin, unable to help
blushing, as he knocked the snow off his cap with his glove.

"all our own set. kitty’s here. come along, i’ll introduce you to
karenin."

stepan arkadyevitch, for all his liberal views, was well aware that to
meet karenin was sure to be felt a flattering distinction, and so
treated his best friends to this honor. but at that instant konstantin
levin was not in a condition to feel all the gratification of making
such an acquaintance. he had not seen kitty since that memorable evening
when he met vronsky, not counting, that is, the moment when he had had a
glimpse of her on t

of iron, through the fine cloth of the
coat.

"what biceps! a perfect samson!"

"i imagine great strength is needed for hunting bears," observed alexey
alexandrovitch, who had the mistiest notions about the chase. he cut off
and spread with cheese a wafer of bread fine as a spider-web.

levin smiled.

"not at all. quite the contrary; a child can kill a bear," he said, with
a slight bow moving aside for the ladies, who were approaching the
table.

"you have killed a bear, i’ve been told!" said kitty, trying assiduously
to catch with her fork a perverse mushroom that would slip away, and
setting the lace quivering over her white arm. "are there bears on your
place?" she added, turning her charming little head to him and smiling.

there was apparently nothing extraordinary in what she said, but what
unutterable meaning there was for him in every sound, in every turn of
her lips, her eyes, her hand as she said it! there was entreaty for
forgiveness, and trust in him, and tenderness—soft, ti

en to him. and this
was the only thing that interested him. not in that room only, but in
the whole world, there existed for him only himself, with enormously
increased importance and dignity in his own eyes, and she. he felt
himself on a pinnacle that made him giddy, and far away down below were
all those nice excellent karenins, oblonskys, and all the world.

quite without attracting notice, without glancing at them, as though
there were no other places left, stepan arkadyevitch put levin and kitty
side by side.

"oh, you may as well sit there," he said to levin.

the dinner was as choice as the china, in which stepan arkadyevitch was
a connoisseur. the _soupe marie-louise_ was a splendid success; the tiny
pies eaten with it melted in the mouth and were irreproachable. the two
footmen and matvey, in white cravats, did their duty with the dishes and
wines unobtrusively, quietly, and swiftly. on the material side the
dinner was a success; it was no less so on the immaterial. the

"but we take our stand on principle as the ideal," replied pestsov in
his mellow bass. "woman desires to have rights, to be independent,
educated. she is oppressed, humiliated by the consciousness of her
disabilities."

"and i’m oppressed and humiliated that they won’t engage me at the
foundling," the old prince said again, to the huge delight of turovtsin,
who in his mirth dropped his asparagus with the thick end in the sauce.



chapter 11


everyone took part in the conversation except kitty and levin. at first,
when they were talking of the influence that one people has on another,
there rose to levin’s mind what he had to say on the subject. but these
ideas, once of such importance in his eyes, seemed to come into his
brain as in a dream, and had now not the slightest interest for him. it
even struck him as strange that they should be so eager to talk of what
was of no use to anyone. kitty, too, should, one would have supposed,
have been interested in what they were saying of t

arenka, of her painful state of dependence, how
often she had wondered about herself what would become of her if she did
not marry, and how often she had argued with her sister about it! but it
did not interest her at all. she and levin had a conversation of their
own, yet not a conversation, but some sort of mysterious communication,
which brought them every moment nearer, and stirred in both a sense of
glad terror before the unknown into which they were entering.

at first levin, in answer to kitty’s question how he could have seen her
last year in the carriage, told her how he had been coming home from the
mowing along the highroad and had met her.

"it was very, very early in the morning. you were probably only just
awake. your mother was asleep in the corner. it was an exquisite
morning. i was walking along wondering who it could be in a
four-in-hand? it was a splendid set of four horses with bells, and in a
second you flashed by, and i saw you at the window—you were sitting like

awfully deeply about something," he said, smiling. "how i should like to
know what you were thinking about then! something important?"

"wasn’t i dreadfully untidy?" she wondered, but seeing the smile of
ecstasy these reminiscences called up, she felt that the impression she
had made had been very good. she blushed and laughed with delight;
"really i don’t remember."

"how nicely turovtsin laughs!" said levin, admiring his moist eyes and
shaking chest.

"have you known him long?" asked kitty.

"oh, everyone knows him!"

"and i see you think he’s a horrid man?"

"not horrid, but nothing in him."

"oh, you’re wrong! and you must give up thinking so directly!" said
kitty. "i used to have a very poor opinion of him too, but he, he’s an
awfully nice and wonderfully good-hearted man. he has a heart of gold."

"how could you find out what sort of heart he has?"

"we are great friends. i know him very well. last winter, soon after ...

alexey alexandrovitch smiled contemptuously. that he knew long ago, but
it could not be applied to his case.

"love those that hate you, but to love those one hates is impossible.
forgive me for having troubled you. everyone has enough to bear in his
own grief!" and regaining his self-possession, alexey alexandrovitch
quietly took leave and went away.



chapter 13


when they rose from table, levin would have liked to follow kitty into
the drawing room; but he was afraid she might dislike this, as too
obviously paying her attention. he remained in the little ring of men,
taking part in the general conversation, and without looking at kitty,
he was aware of her movements, her looks, and the place where she was in
the drawing room.

he did at once, and without the smallest effort, keep the promise he had
made her—always to think well of all men, and to like everyone always.
the conversation fell on the village commune, i

ying to understand. but directly he began to
illustrate his meaning, she understood at once.

"i know: one must find out what he is arguing for, what is precious to
him, then one can..."

she had completely guessed and expressed his badly expressed idea. levin
smiled joyfully; he was struck by this transition from the confused,
verbose discussion with pestsov and his brother to this laconic, clear,
almost wordless communication of the most complex ideas.

shtcherbatsky moved away from them, and kitty, going up to a card table,
sat down, and, taking up the chalk, began drawing diverging circles over
the new green cloth.

they began again on the subject that had been started at dinner—the
liberty and occupations of women. levin was of the opinion of darya
alexandrovna that a girl who did not marry should find a woman’s duties
in a family. he supported this view by the fact that no family can get
on without women to help; that in every family, poor or rich, there are
and must be nurses, ei

ther relations or hired.

"no," said kitty, blushing, but looking at him all the more boldly with
her truthful eyes; "a girl may be so circumstanced that she cannot live
in the family without humiliation, while she herself..."

at the hint he understood her.

"oh, yes," he said. "yes, yes, yes—you’re right; you’re right!"

and he saw all that pestsov had been maintaining at dinner of the
liberty of woman, simply from getting a glimpse of the terror of an old
maid’s existence and its humiliation in kitty’s heart; and loving her

 she stole a look at him, as though asking him, "is
it what i think?"

"i understand," she said, flushing a little.

"what is this word?" he said, pointing to the n that stood for _never_.

"it means _never_," she said; "but that’s not true!"

he quickly rubbed out what he had written, gave her the chalk, and stood
up. she wrote, _t, i, c, n, a, d_.

dolly was completely comforted in the depression caused by her
conversation with alexey alexandrovitch when she caught sight of the two
figures: kitty with the chalk in her hand, with a shy and happy smile
looking upwards at levin, and his handsome figure bending over the table
with glowing eyes fastened one minute on the table and the next on her.
he was suddenly radiant: he had understood. it meant, "then i could not
answer differently."

he glanced at her questioningly, timidly.

"only then?"

"yes," her smile answered.

"and n... and now?" he asked.

"well, read this. i’ll tell you what i should like—should like so much!"
she wrote th

looked into her eyes. he was stupefied with happiness. he could not
supply the word she had meant; but in her charming eyes, beaming with
happiness, he saw all he needed to know. and he wrote three letters. but
he had hardly finished writing when she read them over her arm, and
herself finished and wrote the answer, "yes."

"you’re playing _secrétaire_?" said the old prince. "but we must really
be getting along if you want to be in time at the theater."

levin got up and escorted kitty to the door.

in their conversation everything had been said; it had been said that
she loved him, and that she would tell her father and mother that he
would come tomorrow morning.



chapter 14


when kitty had gone and levin was left alone, he felt such uneasiness
without her, and such an impatient longing to get as quickly, as quickly
as possible, to tomorrow morning, when he would see her again and be
plighted to her forever, that he felt afraid, as though of death, of
those fourteen hours

ality to the ballet. levin only had time to tell him he was happy, and
that he loved him, and would never, never forget what he had done for
him. the eyes and the smile of stepan arkadyevitch showed levin that he
comprehended that feeling fittingly.

"oh, so it’s not time to die yet?" said stepan arkadyevitch, pressing
levin’s hand with emotion.

"n-n-no!" said levin.

darya alexandrovna too, as she said good-bye to him, gave him a sort of
congratulation, saying, "how glad i am you have met kitty again! one
must value old friends." levin did not like these words of darya
alexandrovna’s. she could not understand how lofty and beyond her it all
was, and she ought not to have dared to allude to it. levin said
good-bye to them, but, not to be left alone, he attached himself to his
brother.

"where are you going?"

"i’m going to a meeting."

"well, i’ll come with you. may i?"

"what for? yes, come along," said sergey ivanovitch, smiling. "what is
the matter with you today?"

"with me?

her.

not letting go his hands, she went into the drawing room. the princess,
seeing them, breathed quickly, and immediately began to cry and then
immediately began to laugh, and with a vigorous step levin had not
expected, ran up to him, and hugging his head, kissed him, wetting his
cheeks with her tears.

"so it is all settled! i am glad. love her. i am glad.... kitty!"

"you’ve not been long settling things," said the old prince, trying to
seem unmoved; but levin noticed that his eyes were wet when he turned to
him.

"i’ve long, always wished for this!" said the prince, taking levin by
the arm and drawing him towards himself. "even when this little
feather-head fancied..."

"papa!" shrieked kitty, and shut his mouth with her hands.

"well, i won’t!" he said. "i’m very, very ... plea... oh, what a fool i
am..."

he embraced kitty, kissed her face, he

and there came over levin a new feeling of love for this man, till then
so little known to him, when he saw how slowly and tenderly kitty kissed
his muscular hand.



chapter 16


the princess sat in her armchair, silent and smiling; the prince sat
down beside her. kitty stood by her father’s chair, still holding his
hand. all were silent.

the princess was the first to put everything into words, and to
translate all thoughts and feelings into practical questions. and all
equally felt this strange and painful for the first minute.

"when is it to be? we must have the benediction and announcement. and
when’s the wedding to be? what do you think, alexander?"

"here he is," said the old prince, pointing to levin—"he’s the principal
person in the matter."

evin blushing. "tomorrow; if you ask me, i should say, the
benediction today and the wedding tomorrow."

"come, _mon cher_, that’s nonsense!"

"well, in a week."

"he’s quite mad."

"no, why so?"

"well, upon my word!" said the mother, smiling, delighted at this haste.
"how about the trousseau?"

"will there really be a trousseau and all that?" levin thought with
horror. "but can the trousseau and the benediction and all that—can it
spoil my happiness? nothing can spoil it!" he glanced at kitty, and
noticed that she was not in the least, not in the very least, disturbed
by the idea of the trousseau. "then it must be all right," he thought.

"oh, i know nothing about it; i only said what i should like," he said
apologetically.

"we’ll talk it over, then. the benediction and announcement can take
place now. that’s very well."

the princess went up to her husband, kissed him, and would have gone
away, but he kept her, embraced her, and, tenderly as a young lover,
kissed her several t

he was expected; that they were pleased to see him, and prided
themselves on his happiness, just as every one whom he had to do with
during those days. what was extraordinary was that everyone not only
liked him, but even people previously unsympathetic, cold, and callous,
were enthusiastic over him, gave way to him in everything, treated his
feeling with tenderness and delicacy, and shared his conviction that he
was the happiest man in the world because his betrothed was beyond
perfection. kitty too felt the same thing. when countess nordston
ventured to hint that she had hoped for something better, kitty was so
angry and proved so conclusively that nothing in the world could be
better than levin, that countess nordston had to admit it, and in
kitty’s presence never met levin without a smile of ecstatic admiration.

the confession he had promised was the one painful incident of this
time. he consulted the old prince, and with his sanction gave kitty his
diary, in which there was writ

ivanovitch, stepan arkadyevitch, and the princess guided him in doing
what he had to do. all he did was to agree entirely with everything
suggested to him. his brother raised money for him, the princess advised
him to leave moscow after the wedding. stepan arkadyevitch advised him
to go abroad. he agreed to everything. "do what you choose, if it amuses
you. i’m happy, and my happiness can be no greater and no less for
anything you do," he thought. when he told kitty of stepan
arkadyevitch’s advice that they should go abroad, he was much surprised
that she did not agree to this, and had some definite requirements of
her own in regard to their future. she knew levin had work he loved in
the country. she did not, as he saw, understand this work, she did not
even care to understand it. but that did not prevent her from regarding
it as a matter of great importance. and then she knew their home would
be in the country, and she wanted to go, not abroad where sh

making some arrangements with her maid, sorting over heaps of dresses of
different colors, spread on the backs of chairs and on the floor.

"ah!" she cried, seeing him, and beaming with delight. "kostya!
konstantin dmitrievitch!" (these latter days she used these names almost
alternately.) "i didn’t expect you! i’m going through my wardrobe to see
what’s for whom..."

"oh! that’s very nice!" he said gloomily, looking at the maid.

"you can go, dunyasha, i’ll call you presently," said kitty. "kostya,
what’s the matter?" she asked, definitely adopting this familiar name as
soon as the maid had gone out. she noticed his strange face, agitated
and gloomy, and a panic came over her.

"kitty! i’m in torture. i can’t suffer alone," he said with despair in
his voice, standing before her and looking imploringly into her eyes. he
saw already from her loving, truthful face, that nothing could come of
what he had meant to say, but yet he wanted her to reassure him herself.
"i’ve come

son with vexation. but
his face was so piteous, that she restrained her vexation, and flinging
some clothes off an arm-chair, she sat down beside him. "what are you
thinking? tell me all."

"i am thinking you can’t love me. what can you love me for?"

"my god! what can i do?..." she said, and burst into tears.

"oh! what have i done?" he cried, and kneeling before her, he fell to
kissing her hands.

when the princess came into the room five minutes later, she found them
completely reconciled. kitty had not simply assured him that she loved
him, but had gone so far—in answer to his question, what she loved him
for—as to explain what for. she told him that she loved him because she
understood him completely, because she knew what he would like, and
because everything he liked was good. and this seemed to him perfectly
clear. when the princess came to them, they were sitting side by side on
the chest, sorting the dresses and disputing over kitty’s wanting to
give dunyasha the brown dre

ss she had been wearing when levin proposed
to her, while he insisted that that dress must never be given away, but
dunyasha must have the blue one.

"how is it you don’t see? she’s a brunette, and it won’t suit her....
i’ve worked it all out."

hearing why he had come, the princess was half humorously, half
seriously angry with him, and sent him home to dress and not to hinder
kitty’s hair-dressing, as charles the hair-dresser was just coming.

"as it is, she’s been eating nothing lately and is losing her looks, and
then you must come and upset her with your nonsense," she said to him.
"get along with you, my dear!"

levin, guilty and shamefaced, but pacified, went back to his hotel. his
brother, darya alexandrovna, and stepan arkadyevitch, all in full dress,
were waiting for him to bless him with the holy picture. there was no
time to lose. darya alexandrovna had to d

st was continually sending first the beadle
and then the deacon to find out whether the bridegroom had not come,
more and more often he went himself, in a lilac vestment and an
embroidered sash, to the side door, expecting to see the bridegroom. at
last one of the ladies, glancing at her watch, said, "it really is
strange, though!" and all the guests became uneasy and began loudly
expressing their wonder and dissatisfaction. one of the bridegroom’s
best men went to find out what had happened. kitty meanwhile had long
ago been quite ready, and in her white dress and long veil and wreath of
orange blossoms she was standing in the drawing-room of the
shtcherbatskys’ house with her sister, madame lvova, who was her
bridal-mother. she was looking out of the window, and had been for over
half an hour anxiously expecting to hear from the best man that her
bridegroom was at the church.

levin meanwhile, in his trousers, but without his coat and waistcoat,
was walking to and fro in his room at t

everything was shut up—it was sunday. they sent to stepan arkadyevitch’s
and brought a shirt—it was impossibly wide and short. they sent finally
to the shtcherbatskys’ to unpack the things. the bridegroom was expected
at the church while he was pacing up and down his room like a wild beast
in a cage, peeping out into the corridor, and with horror and despair
recalling what absurd things he had said to kitty and what she might be
thinking now.

at last the guilty kouzma flew panting into the room with the shirt.

"only just in time. they were just lifting it into the van," said
kouzma.

three minutes later levin ran full speed into the corridor, not looking
at his watch for fear of aggravating his sufferings.

"you won’t help matters like this," said stepan arkadyevitch with a
smile, hurrying with more deliberation after him. "it will come round,
it will come round ... i tell you."

en roubles," he added, relaxing his lips into
a smile. "i have decided, but i was afraid you might not agree."

levin saw it was a joke, but he could not smile.

"well, how’s it to be then?—unlighted or lighted candles? that’s the
question."

"yes, yes, unlighted."

"oh, i’m very glad. the question’s decided!" said stepan arkadyevitch,
smiling. "how silly men are, though, in this position," he said to
tchirikov, when levin, after looking absently at him, had moved back to
his bride.

"kitty, mind you’re the first to step on the carpet," said countess
nordston, coming up. "you’re a nice person!" she said to levin.

"aren’t you frightened, eh?" said marya dmitrievna, an old aunt.

"are you cold? you’re pale. stop a minute, stoop down," said kitty’s
sister, madame lvova, and with her plump, handsome arms she smilingly
set straight the flowers on her head.

dolly came up, tried to say something, but could not speak, cried, and
then laughed unnaturally.

kitty looked at all o

eyes as levin.

meanwhile the officiating clergy had got into their vestments, and the
priest and deacon came out to the lectern, which stood in the forepart
of the church. the priest turned to levin saying something. levin did
not hear what the priest said.

"take the bride’s hand and lead her up," the best man said to levin.

it was a long while before levin could make out what was expected of
him. for a long time they tried to set him right and made him begin
again—because he kept taking kitty by the wrong arm or with the wrong
arm—till he understood at last that what he had to do was, without
changing his position, to take her right hand in his right hand. when at
last he had taken the bride’s hand in the correct way, the priest walked
a few paces in front of them and stopped at the lectern. the crowd of
friends and relations moved after them, with a buzz of talk and a rustle
of skirts. someone stooped down and pulled out the bride’s train. the
church became so still that the

the priest lighted two candles, wreathed with flowers, and holding them
sideways so that the wax dropped slowly from them he turned, facing the
bridal pair. the priest was the same old man that had confessed levin.
he looked with weary and melancholy eyes at the bride and bridegroom,
sighed, and putting his right hand out from his vestment, blessed the
bridegroom with it, and also with a shade of solicitous tenderness laid
the crossed fingers on the bowed head of kitty. then he gave them the
candles, and taking the censer, moved slowly away from them.

"can it be true?" thought levin, and he looked round at his bride.
looking down at her he saw her face in profile, and from the scarcely
perceptible quiver of her lips and eyelashes he knew she was aware of
his eyes upon her. she did not look round, but the high scalloped
collar, that reached her little pink ear, trembled faintly. he saw that
a sigh was held back in her throat, and the little hand in the long

unknown. and now behold—anticipation and uncertainty and remorse at the
abandonment of the old life—all was ending, and the new was beginning.
this new life could not but have terrors for her inexperience; but,
terrible or not, the change had been wrought six weeks before in her
soul, and this was merely the final sanction of what had long been
completed in her heart.

turning again to the lectern, the priest with some difficulty took
kitty’s little ring, and asking levin for his hand, put it on the first
joint of his finger. "the servant of god, konstantin, plights his troth
to the servant of god, ekaterina." and putting his big ring on kitty’s
touchingly weak, pink little finger, the priest said the same thing.

and the bridal pair tried several times to understand what they had to
do, and each time made some mistake and were corrected by the priest in
a whisper. at last, having duly performed the ceremony, having signed
the

 rings with the cross, the priest handed kitty the big ring, and
levin the little one. again they were puzzled, and passed the rings from
hand to hand, still without doing what was expected.

dolly, tchirikov, and stepan arkadyevitch stepped forward to set them
right. there was an interval of hesitation, whispering, and smiles; but
the expression of solemn emotion on the faces of the betrothed pair did
not change: on the contrary, in their perplexity over their hands they
looked more grave and deeply moved than before, and the smile with wh

 prettier. i was married in the evening too..." answered madame
korsunskaya, and she sighed, remembering how charming she had been that
day, and how absurdly in love her husband was, and how different it all
was now.

"they say if anyone’s best man more than ten times, he’ll never be
married. i wanted to be for the tenth time, but the post was taken,"
said count siniavin to the pretty princess tcharskaya, who had designs
on him.

princess tcharskaya only answered with a smile. she looked at kitty,
thinking how and when she would stand with count siniavin in kitty’s
place, and how she would remind him then of his joke today.

shtcherbatsky told the old maid of honor, madame nikolaeva, that he
meant to put the crown on kitty’s chignon for luck.

"she ought not to have worn a chignon," answered madame nikolaeva, who
had long ago made up her mind that if the elderly widower she was
angling for married her, the wedding should be of the simplest. "i don’t
like such grandeur."

ess nordston said to madame
lvova. "still he’s not worth her little finger, is he?"

"oh, i like him so—not because he’s my future _beau-frère_," answered
madame lvova. "and how well he’s behaving! it’s so difficult, too, to
look well in such a position, not to be ridiculous. and he’s not
ridiculous, and not affected; one can see he’s moved."

"you expected it, i suppose?"

"almost. she always cared for him."

"well, we shall see which of them will step on the rug first. i warned
kitty."

"it will make no difference," said madame lvova; "we’re all obedient
wives; it’s in our family."

"oh, i stepped on the rug before vassily on purpose. and you, dolly?"

dolly stood beside them; she heard them, but she did not answer. she was
deeply moved. the tears stood in her eyes, and she could not have spoken
without crying. she was rejoicing over kitty and levin; going back in
thought to her own wedding, she glanced at the radiant figure of stepan
arkadyevitch, forgot all the presen

t, and remembered only her own
innocent love. she recalled not herself only, but all her women-friends
and acquaintances. she thought of them on the one day of their triumph,
when they had stood like kitty under the wedding crown, with love and
hope and dread in their hearts, renouncing the past, and stepping
forward into the mysterious future. among the brides that came back to
her memory, she thought too of her darling anna, of whose proposed
divorce she had just been hearing. and she had stood just as innocent in
orange flowers and bridal veil. and now? "it’s terribly strange," she
said to herself. it was not merely the sisters, the women-friends and
female relations of the bride who were fo

chapter 6


when the ceremony of plighting troth was over, the beadle spread before
the lectern in the middle of the church a piece of pink silken stuff,
the choir sang a complicated and elaborate psalm, in which the bass and
tenor sang responses to one another, and the priest turning round
pointed the bridal pair to the pink silk rug. though both had often
heard a great deal about the saying that the one who steps first on the
rug will be the head of the house, neither levin nor kitty were capable
of recollecting it, as they took the few steps towards it. they did not
hear the loud remarks and disputes that followed, some maintaining he
had stepped on first, and others that both had stepped on together.

after the customary questions, whether they desired to enter upon
matrimony, and whether they were pledged to anyone else, and their
answers, which sounded strange to themselves, a new ceremony began.
kitty listened to the words of the prayer, trying to make out their

they alluded to god’s creation of a wife from adam’s rib "and for this
cause a man shall leave father and mother, and cleave unto his wife, and
they two shall be one flesh," and that "this is a great mystery"; they
prayed that god would make them fruitful and bless them, like isaac and
rebecca, joseph, moses and zipporah, and that they might look upon their
children’s children. "that’s all splendid," thought kitty, catching the
words, "all that’s just as it should be," and a smile of happiness,
unconsciously reflected in everyone who looked at her, beamed on her
radiant face.

"put it on quite," voices were heard urging when the priest had put on
the wedding crowns and shtcherbatsky, his hand shaking in its
three-button glove, held the crown high above her head.

"put it on!" she whispered, smiling.

levin looked round at her, and was struck by the joyful radiance on her
face, and unconsciously her fee

cup of warm red wine
and water, and they were still more pleased when the priest, flinging
back his stole and taking both their hands in his, led them round the
lectern to the accompaniment of bass voices chanting "glory to god."

shtcherbatsky and tchirikov, supporting the crowns and stumbling over
the bride’s train, smiling too and seeming delighted at something, were
at one moment left behind, at the next treading on the bridal pair as
the priest came to a halt. the spark of joy kindled in kitty seemed to
have infected everyone in the church. it seemed to levin that the priest
and the deacon too wanted to smile just as he did.

taking the crowns off their heads the priest read the last prayer and
congratulated the young people. levin looked at kitty, and he had never
before seen her look as she did. she was charming with the new radiance
of happiness in her face. levin longed to say something to her, but he
did not know whether it was all over. the priest got him out of his
difficulty.

fore. although
levin believed himself to have the most exact conceptions of domestic
life, unconsciously, like all men, he pictured domestic life as the
happiest enjoyment of love, with nothing to hinder and no petty cares to
distract. he ought, as he conceived the position, to do his work, and to
find repose from it in the happiness of love. she ought to be beloved,
and nothing more. but, like all men, he forgot that she too would want
work. and he was surprised that she, his poetic, exquisite kitty, could,
not merely in the first weeks, but even in the first days of their
married life, think, remember, and busy herself about tablecloths, and
furniture, about mattresses for visitors, about a tray, about the cook,
and the dinner, and so on. while they were still engaged, he had been
struck by the definiteness with which she had declined the tour abroad
and decided to go into the country, as though she knew of something she
wanted, and could still think of something outside her love. this ha

rooms for visitors; a room for dolly; saw after an abode for her new
maid; ordered dinner of the old cook; came into collision with agafea
mihalovna, taking from her the charge of the stores. he saw how the old
cook smiled, admiring her, and listening to her inexperienced,
impossible orders, how mournfully and tenderly agafea mihalovna shook
her head over the young mistress’s new arrangements. he saw that kitty
was extraordinarily sweet when, laughing and crying, she came to tell
him that her maid, masha, was used to looking upon her as her young
lady, and so no one obeyed her. it seemed to him sweet, but strange, and
he thought it would have been better without this.

he did not know how great a sense of change she was experiencing; she,
who at home had sometimes wanted some favorite dish, or sweets, without
the possibility of getting either, now could order what she liked, buy

favorite puddings and dolly would appreciate all her new housekeeping.
she did not know herself why and wherefore, but the arranging of her
house had an irresistible attraction for her. instinctively feeling the
approach of spring, and knowing that there would be days of rough
weather too, she built her nest as best she could, and was in haste at
the same time to build it and to learn how to do it.

this care for domestic details in kitty, so opposed to levin’s ideal of
exalted happiness, was at first one of the disappointments; and this
sweet care of her household, the aim of which he did not understand, but
could not help loving, was one of the new happy surprises.

another disappointment and happy surprise came in their quarrels. levin
could never have conceived that between him and his wife any relations
could arise other than tender, respectful and loving, and all at once in
the very early days they quarreled, so that she

chapter 16


when levin went upstairs, his wife was sitting near the new silver
samovar behind the new tea service, and, having settled old agafea
mihalovna at a little table with a full cup of tea, was reading a letter
from dolly, with whom they were in continual and frequent
correspondence.

"you see, your good lady’s settled me here, told me to sit a bit with
her," said agafea mihalovna, smiling affectionately at kitty.

in these words of agafea mihalovna, levin read the final act of the
drama which had been enacted of late between her and kitty. he saw that,
in spite of agafea mihalovna’s feelings being hurt by a new mistress
taking the reins of government out of her hands, kitty had yet conquered
her and made her love her.

"here, i opened your letter too," said kitty, handing him an illiterate
letter. "it’s from that woman, i think, your brother’s..." she said. "i

she had found nikolay dmitrievitch, had again made it up with him in
moscow, and had moved with him to a provincial town, where he had
received a post in the government service. but that he had quarreled
with the head official, and was on his way back to moscow, only he had
been taken so ill on the road that it was doubtful if he would ever
leave his bed again, she wrote. "it’s always of you he has talked, and,
besides, he has no more money left."

"read this; dolly writes about you," kitty was beginning, with a smile;
but she stopped suddenly, noticing the changed expression on her
husband’s face.

"what is it? what’s the matter?"

"she writes to me that nikolay, my brother, is at death’s door. i shall
go to him."

kitty’s face changed at once. thoughts of tanya as a marquise, of dolly,
all had vanished.

"when are you going?" she said.

"tomorrow."

"and i will go with you, can i?" she said.

"kitty! what are you thinking of?" he said reproachfully.

"how do you mean?" o

ith vexation. "why shouldn’t i go? i shan’t be in your
way. i..."

"i’m going because my brother is dying," said levin. "why should you..."

"why? for the same reason as you."

"and, at a moment of such gravity for me, she only thinks of her being
dull by herself," thought levin. and this lack of candor in a matter of
such gravity infuriated him.

"it’s out of the question," he said sternly.

agafea mihalovna, seeing that it was coming to a quarrel, gently put
down her cup and withdrew. kitty did not even notice her. the tone in
which her husband had said the last words wounded her, especially
because he evidently did not believe what she had said.

"i tell you, that if you go, i shall come with you; i shall certainly
come," she said hastily and wrathfully. "why out of the question? why do
you say it’s out of the question?"

"because it’ll be going god knows where, by all sorts of roads and to
all sorts of hotels. you would be a hindrance to me," said levin, trying
to be cool.

"not at all. i don’t want anything. where you can go, i can...."

"well, for one thing then, because this woman’s there whom you can’t
meet."

"i don’t know and don’t care to know who’s there and what. i know that
my husband’s brother is dying and my husband is going to him, and i go
with my husband too...."

"kitty! don’t get angry. but just think a little: this is a matter of
such importance that i can’t bear to think that you should bring in a
feeling of weakness, of dislike to being left alone. come, you’ll be
dull alone, so go and stay at moscow a little."

"there, you always ascribe base, vile motives to me," she said with
tears of wounded pride and fury. "i didn’t mean, it wasn’t weakness, it
wasn’t ... i feel that it’s my duty to be with my husband when he’s in
trouble, but you try

ry? you could have been free. why did you, if you
regret it?" she said, getting up and running away into the drawing room.

when he went to her, she was sobbing.

he began to speak, trying to find words not to dissuade but simply to
soothe her. but she did not heed him, and would not agree to anything.
he bent down to her and took her hand, which resisted him. he kissed her
hand, kissed her hair, kissed her hand again—still she was silent. but
when he took her face in both his hands and said "kitty!" she suddenly
recovered herself, and began to cry, and they were reconciled.

it was decided that they should go together the next day. levin told his
wife that he believed she wanted to go simply in order to be of use,
agreed that marya nikolaevna’s being with his brother did not make her
going improper, but he set off at the bottom of his heart dissatisfied
both with her and with himself. he was dissatisfied with her for being
unable to make up her mind to let him go when it was necessary

how
strange it was for him to think that he, so lately hardly daring to
believe in such happiness as that she could love him—now was unhappy
because she loved him too much!), and he was dissatisfied with himself
for not showing more strength of will. even greater was the feeling of
disagreement at the bottom of his heart as to her not needing to
consider the woman who was with his brother, and he thought with horror
of all the contingencies they might meet with. the mere idea of his
wife, his kitty, being in the same room with a common wench, set him
shuddering with horror and loathing.



chapter 17


the hotel of the provincial town where nikolay levin was lying ill was
one of those provincial hotels which are constructed on the newest model
of modern improvements, with the best intentions of cleanliness,
comfort, and even elegance, but owing to the public that patronizes
them, are with astounding rapidity transformed into filthy taverns with
a pretension of modern improvement that only

e.... are you

levin did not for the first moment understand what it was confused her,
but she immediately enlightened him.

"i’ll go away. i’ll go down to the kitchen," she brought out. "nikolay
dmitrievitch will be delighted. he heard about it, and knows your lady,
and remembers her abroad."

levin realized that she meant his wife, and did not know what answer to
make.

"come along, come along to him!" he said.

but as soon as he moved, the door of his room opened and kitty peeped
out. levin crimsoned both from shame and anger with his wife, who had
put herself and him in such a difficult position; but marya nikolaevna
crimsoned still more. she positively shrank together and flushed to the
point of tears, and clutching the ends of her apron in both hands,
twisted them in her red fingers without knowing what to say and what to
do.

for the first instant levin saw an expression of eager curiosity in the
eyes with which kitty looked at this awful woman, so incomprehe

her; but it lasted only a single instant.

"well! how is he?" she turned to her husband and then to her.

"but one can’t go on talking in the passage like this!" levin said,
looking angrily at a gentleman who walked jauntily at that instant
across the corridor, as though about his affairs.

"well then, come in," said kitty, turning to marya nikolaevna, who had
recovered herself, but noticing her husband’s face of dismay, "or go on;
go, and then come for me," she said, and went back into the room.

levin went to his brother’s room. he had not in the least expected what
he saw and felt in his brother’s room. he had expected to find him in
the same state of self-deception which he had heard was so frequent with
the consumptive, and which had struck him so much during his brother’s
visit in the autumn. he had

here, i expect. marya! clear up the room," the sick man said with
effort. "oh, and when you’ve cleared up, go away yourself," he added,
looking inquiringly at his brother.

levin made no answer. going out into the corridor, he stopped short. he
had said he would fetch his wife, but now, taking stock of the emotion
he was feeling, he decided that he would try on the contrary to persuade
her not to go in to the sick man. "why should she suffer as i am
suffering?" he thought.

"well, how is he?" kitty asked with a frightened face.

"oh, it’s awful, it’s awful! what did you come for?" said levin.

kitty was silent for a few seconds, looking timidly and ruefully at her
husband; then she went up and took him by the elbow with both hands.

"kostya! take me to him; it will be easier for us to bear it together.
you only take me, take me to him, please, and go away," she said. "you
must understand that for me to see you, and not to see him, is far more
painful. there i might be a help to you an

d to him. please, let me!" she
besought her husband, as though the happiness of her life depended on
it.

levin was obliged to agree, and regaining his composure, and completely
forgetting about marya nikolaevna by now, he went again in to his
brother with kitty.

stepping lightly, and continually glancing at her husband, showing him a
valorous and sympathetic face, kitty went into the sick-room, and,
turning without haste, noiselessly closed the door. with inaudible steps
she went quickly to the sick man’s bedside, and going up so that he had
not to turn his head, she immediately clasped in her fresh young hand
the skeleton of his huge hand, pressed it, and began speaking with that
soft eagerness, sympathetic and not jarring, which is peculiar to women.

"we have met, though we were not acquainted, at soden," she said. "you
never thought i was to be your sist

hink of all these details. he was absolutely convinced
that nothing could be done to prolong his brother’s life or to relieve
his suffering. but a sense of his regarding all aid as out of the
question was felt by the sick man, and exasperated him. and this made it
still more painful for levin. to be in the sick-room was agony to him,
not to be there still worse. and he was continually, on various
pretexts, going out of the room, and coming in again, because he was
unable to remain alone.

but kitty thought, and felt, and acted quite differently. on seeing the
sick man, she pitied him. and pity in her womanly heart did not arouse
at all that feeling of horror and loathing that it aroused in her
husband, but a desire to act, to find out all the details of his state,
and to remedy them. and since she had not the slightest doubt that it
was her duty to help him, she had no doubt either that it was possible,
and immediately set to work. the very details, the mere thought of which

answer to her
summons, and could not avoid carrying out her orders, as she gave them
with such gracious insistence that there was no evading her. levin did
not approve of all this; he did not believe it would be of any good to
the patient. above all, he feared the patient would be angry at it. but
the sick man, though he seemed and was indifferent about it, was not
angry, but only abashed, and on the whole as it were interested in what
she was doing with him. coming back from the doctor to whom kitty had
sent him, levin, on opening the door, came upon the sick man at the
instant when, by kitty’s directions, they were changing his linen. the
long white ridge of his spine, with the huge, prominent shoulder blades
and jutting ribs and vertebrae, was bare, and marya nikolaevna and the
waiter were struggling with the sleeve of the night shirt, and could not
get the long, limp arm into it. kitty, hurriedly closing the door after
levin, was not looking that way; but the sick man groaned, and she

 moved
rapidly towards him.

"make haste," she said.

"oh, don’t you come," said the sick man angrily. "i’ll do it my
myself...."

"what say?" queried marya nikolaevna. but kitty heard and saw he was
ashamed and uncomfortable at being naked before her.

"i’m not looking, i’m not looking!" she said, putting the arm in. "marya
nikolaevna, you come this side, you do it," she added.

"please go for me, there’s a little bottle in my small bag," she said,
turning to her husband, "you know, in the side pocket; bring it, please,
and meanwhile they’ll finish clearing up here."

returning with the bottle, levin found the sick man settled comfortably
and everything about h

im completely changed. the heavy smell was
replaced by the smell of aromatic vinegar, which kitty with pouting lips
and puffed-out, rosy cheeks was squirting through a little pipe. there
was no dust visible anywhere, a rug was laid by the bedside. on the
table stood medicine bottles and decanters tidily arranged, and the
linen needed was folded up there, and kitty’s _broderie anglaise_. on
the other table by the patient’s bed there were candles and drink and
powders. the sick man himself, washed and combed, lay in clean sheets on
high raised pillows, in a clean night-shirt with a white collar about
his astoundingly thin neck, and with a new expression of hope looked
fixedly at kitty.

the doctor brought by levin, and found by him at the club, was not the
one who had been attending nikolay levin, as the patient was
dissatisfied with him. the new docto

 had gone
away the sick man said something to his brother, of which levin could
distinguish only the last words: "your katya." by the expression with
which he gazed at her, levin saw that he was praising her. he called
indeed to katya, as he called her.

"i’m much better already," he said. "why, with you i should have got
well long ago. how nice it is!" he took her hand and drew it towards his
lips, but as though afraid she would dislike it he changed his mind, let
it go, and only stroked it. kitty took his hand in both hers and pressed
it.

"now turn me over on the left side and go to bed," he said.

no one could make out what he said but kitty; she alone understood. she
understood because she was all the while mentally keeping watch on what
he needed.

"on the other side," she said to her husband, "he always sleeps on that
side. turn him over, it’s so disagreeable calling the servants. i’m not
strong enough. can you?" she said to marya nikolaevna.

"i’m afraid not," answered marya

 nikolaevna.

terrible as it was to levin to put his arms round that terrible body, to
take hold of that under the quilt, of which he preferred to know
nothing, under his wife’s influence he made his resolute face that she
knew so well, and putting his arms into the bed took hold of the body,
but in spite of his own strength he was struck by the strange heaviness
of those powerless limbs. while he was turning him over, conscious of
the huge emaciated arm about his neck, kitty swiftly and noiselessly
turned the pillow, beat it up and settled in it the sick man’s head,
smoothing back his hair, which was sticking again to his moist brow.

the sick man kept his brother’s hand in his own. levin felt that he
meant to do something with his hand and was pulling it somewhere. levin
yielded with a sinking heart: yes, he drew it to his mouth and kissed
it. levin, shaking with sobs and unable to articulate a word, went out
of the room.

greater terror waited, and would not have known what else to do.

more than that, he did not know what to say, how to look, how to move.
to talk of outside things seemed to him shocking, impossible, to talk of
death and depressing subjects—also impossible. to be silent, also
impossible. "if i look at him he will think i am studying him, i am
afraid; if i don’t look at him, he’ll think i’m thinking of other
things. if i walk on tiptoe, he will be vexed; to tread firmly, i’m
ashamed." kitty evidently did not think of herself, and had no time to
think about herself: she was thinking about him because she knew
something, and all went well. she told him about herself even and about
her wedding, and smiled and sympathized with him and petted him, and
talked of cases of recovery and all went well; so then she must know.
the proof that her behavior and agafea mihalovna’s was not instinctive,
animal, irrational, was that apart from the physical treatment, the
relief of suffering, both

agafea mihalovna and kitty required for the
dying man something else more important than the physical treatment, and
something which had nothing in common with physical conditions. agafea
mihalovna, speaking of the man just dead, had said: "well, thank god, he
took the sacrament and received absolution; god grant each one of us
such a death." katya in just the same way, besides all her care about
linen, bedsores, drink, found time the very first day to persuade the
sick man of the necessity of taking the sacrament and re

absolution.

on getting back from the sick-room to their own two rooms for the night,
levin sat with hanging head not knowing what to do. not to speak of
supper, of preparing for bed, of considering what they were going to do,
he could not even talk to his wife; he was ashamed to. kitty, on the
contrary, was more active than usual. she was even livelier than usual.
she ordered supper to be brought, herself unpacked their things, and
herself helped to make the beds, and did not even forget to sprinkle
them with persian powder. she showed that alertness, that swiftness of
reflection comes out in men before a battle, in conflict, in the
dangerous and decisive moments of life—those moments when a man shows
once and for all his value, and that all his past has not been wasted

young. you would not believe how charming he was as a youth, but i did
not understand him then."

"i can quite, quite believe it. how i feel that we might have been
friends!" she said; and, distressed at what she had said, she looked
round at her husband, and tears came into her eyes.

"yes, _might have been_," he said mournfully. "he’s just one of those
people of whom they say they’re not for this world."

"but we have many days before us; we must go to bed," said kitty,
glancing at her tiny watch.



chapter 20


the next day the sick man received the sacrament and extreme unction.
during the ceremony nikolay levin prayed fervently. his great eyes,
fastened on the holy image that was set out on a card table covered with
a colored napkin, expressed such passionate prayer and hope that it was
awful to levin to see it. levin knew that this passionate prayer and
hope would only make him feel more bitterly parting from the life he so
loved. levin knew his brother 
 
 ___________________________
 
and the workings of his intellect: he knew
that his unbelief came not from life being easier for him without faith,
but had grown up because step by step the contemporary scientific
interpretation of natural phenomena crushed out the possibility of
faith; and so he knew that his present return was not a legitimate one,
brought about by way of the same working of his intellect, but simply a
temporary, interested return to faith in a desperate hope of recovery.
levin knew too that kitty had strengthened his hope by accounts of the
marvelous recoveries she had heard of. levin knew all this; and it was
agonizingly painful to him to behold the supplicating, hopeful eyes and
the emaciated wrist, lifted with difficulty, making the sign of the
cross on the tense brow, and the prominent shoulders and hollow, gasping
chest, which one could not feel consistent with the life the sick man
was praying for. during the sacrament levin did what he, an unbeliever,
had done a thousand times. h
 
 ___________________________
 
e said, addressing god, "if thou dost exist,
make this man to recover" (of course this same thing has been repeated
many times), "and thou wilt save him and me."

after extreme unction the sick man became suddenly much better. he did
not cough once in the course of an hour, smiled, kissed kitty’s hand,
thanking her with tears, and said he was comfortable, free from pain,
and that he felt strong and had an appetite. he even raised himself when
his soup was brought, and asked for a cutlet as well. hopelessly ill as
he was, obvious as it was at the first glance that he could not recover,
levin and kitty were for that hour both in the same state of excitement,
happy, though fearful of being mistaken.

"is he better?"

"yes, much."

"it’s wonderful."

"there’s nothing wonderful in it
 
 ___________________________
 
."

"anyway, he’s better," they said in a whisper, smiling to one another.

this self-deception was not of long duration. the sick man fell into a
quiet sleep, but he was waked up half an hour later by his cough. and
all at once every hope vanished in those about him and in himself. the
reality of his suffering crushed all hopes in levin and kitty and in the
sick man himself, leaving no doubt, no memory even of past hopes.

without referring to what he had believed in half an hour before, as
though ashamed even to recall it, he asked for iodine to inhale in a
bottle covered with perforated paper. levin gave him the bottle, and the
same look of passionate hope with which he had taken the sacrament was
now fastened on his brother, demanding from him the confirmation of the
doctor’s words that inhaling iodine worked wonders.

"is katya no

his own thoughts kept coming to him of what he had to do next; closing
the dead man’s eyes, dressing him, ordering the coffin. and, strange to
say, he felt utterly cold, and was not conscious of sorrow nor of loss,
less still of pity for his brother. if he had any feeling for his
brother at that moment, it was envy for the knowledge the dying man had
now that he could not have.

a long time more he sat over him so, continually expecting the end. but
the end did not come. the door opened and kitty appeared. levin got up
to stop her. but at the moment he was getting up, he caught the sound of
the dying man stirring.

"don’t go away," said nikolay and held out his hand. levin gave him his,
and angrily waved to his wife to go away.

with the dying man’s hand in his hand, he sat for half an hour, an hour,
another hour. he did not think of death at all now. he wondered what
kitty was doing; who lived in the next room; whether the doctor lived in
a house of his own. he longed for food and

hdrew his hand, and without looking at the dying man, went off to his
own room and went to sleep. when he woke up, instead of news of his
brother’s death which he expected, he learned that the sick man had
returned to his earlier condition. he had begun sitting up again,
coughing, had begun eating again, talking again, and again had ceased to
talk of death, again had begun to express hope of his recovery, and had
become more irritable and more gloomy than ever. no one, neither his
brother nor kitty, could soothe him. he was angry with everyone, and
said nasty things to everyone, reproached everyone for his sufferings,
and insisted that they should get him a celebrated doctor from moscow.
to all inquiries made him as to how he felt, he made the same answer
with an expression of vindictive reproachfulness, "i’m suffering
horribly, intolerably!"

the sick man was suffering more and more, especially from bedsores,
which it was impossible now to remedy, and grew more and more angry with
ever

yone about him, blaming them for everything, and especially for not
having brought him a doctor from moscow. kitty tried in every possible
way to relieve him, to soothe him; but it was all in vain, and levin saw
that she herself was exhausted both physically and morally, though she
would not admit it. the sense of death, which had been evoked in all by
his taking leave of life on the night when he had sent for his brother,
was broken up. everyone knew that he must inevitably die soon, that he
was half dead already. everyone wished for nothing but that he should
die as soon as possible, and everyone, conceal

s.

the sick man said nothing.

"what am i to write to him?" said levin. "i hope you are not angry with
him?"

"no, not the least!" nikolay answered, vexed at the question. "tell him
to send me a doctor."

three more days of agony followed; the sick man was still in the same
condition. the sense of longing for his death was felt by everyone now
at the mere sight of him, by the waiters and the hotel-keeper and all
the people staying in the hotel, and the doctor and marya nikolaevna and
levin and kitty. the sick man alone did not express this feeling, but on
the contrary was furious at their not getting him doctors, and went on
taking medicine and talking of life. only at rare moments, when the
opium gave him an instant’s relief from the never-ceasing pain, he would
sometimes, half asleep, utter what was ever more intense in his heart
than in all the others: "oh, if it were only the end!" or: "when will it
be over?"

his sufferings, steadily growing more intense, did their work and
prepared

of deliverance, and so he did not speak of it, and from habit asked for
the satisfaction of desires which could not now be satisfied. "turn me
over on the other side," he would say, and immediately after he would
ask to be turned back again as before. "give me some broth. take away
the broth. talk of something: why are you silent?" and directly they
began to talk he would close his eyes, and would show weariness,
indifference, and loathing.

on the tenth day from their arrival at the town, kitty was unwell. she
suffered from headache and sickness, and she could not get up all the
morning.

the doctor opined that the indisposition arose from fatigue and
excitement, and prescribed rest.

after dinner, however, kitty got up and went as usual with her work to
the sick man. he looked at her sternly when she came in, and smiled
contemptuously when she said she had been unwell. that day he was
continually blowing his nose, and groaning piteously.

"how do you feel?" she asked him.

"worse," h

the corridor.

"he has begun picking at himself," said marya nikolaevna.

"how do you mean?"

"like this," she said, tugging at the folds of her woolen skirt. levin
noticed, indeed, that all that day the patient pulled at himself, as it
were, trying to snatch something away.

marya nikolaevna’s prediction came true. towards night the sick man was
not able to lift his hands, and could only gaze before him with the same
intensely concentrated expression in his eyes. even when his brother or
kitty bent over him, so that he could see them, he looked just the same.
kitty sent for the priest to read the prayer for the dying.

while the priest was reading it, the dying man did not show any sign of
life; his eyes were closed. levin, kitty, and marya nikolaevna stood at
the bedside. the priest had not quite finished reading the prayer when
the dying man stretched, sighed, and opened his eyes. the priest, on
finishing the prayer, put the cross to the cold forehead, then slowly
returned it to th

e terrible than ever. but now, thanks to his wife’s presence,
that feeling did not reduce him to despair. in spite of death, he felt
the need of life and love. he felt that love saved him from despair, and
that this love, under the menace of despair, had become still stronger
and purer. the one mystery of death, still unsolved, had scarcely passed
before his eyes, when another mystery had arisen, as insoluble, urging
him to love and to life.

the doctor confirmed his suppositions in regard to kitty. her
indisposition was a symptom that she was with child.



chapter 21


from the moment when alexey alexandrovitch understood from his
interviews with betsy and with stepan arkadyevitch that all that was
expected of him was to leave his wife in peace, without burdening her
with his presence, and that his wife herself desired this, he felt so
distraught that he could come to no decision of himself; he did not know
himself what he wanted now, and putting himself in the hands of those

love because he saw that this was the only means of soothing her, and he
did not reproach her in words, but in his heart he reproached her.

and the asseverations of his love, which seemed to him so vulgar that he
was ashamed to utter them, she drank in eagerly, and gradually became
calmer. the next day, completely reconciled, they left for the country.




part six



chapter 1


darya alexandrovna spent the summer with her children at pokrovskoe, at
her sister kitty levin’s. the house on her own estate was quite in
ruins, and levin and his wife had persuaded her to spend the summer with
them. stepan arkadyevitch greatly approved of the arrangement. he said
he was very sorry his official duties prevented him from spending the
summer in the country with his family, which would have been the
greatest happiness for him; and remaining in moscow, he came down to the
country from time to time for a day or two. besides the oblonskys, with
all their children and 
 
 ___________________________
 
their governess, the old princess too came to
stay that summer with the levins, as she considered it her duty to watch
over her inexperienced daughter in her _interesting condition_.
moreover, varenka, kitty’s friend abroad, kept her promise to come to
kitty when she was married, and stayed with her friend. all of these
were friends or relations of levin’s wife. and though he liked them all,
he rather regretted his own levin world and ways, which was smothered by
this influx of the "shtcherbatsky element," as he called it to himself.
of his own relations there stayed with him only sergey ivanovitch, but
he too was a man of the koznishev and not the levin stamp, so that the
levin spirit was utterly obliterated.

in the levins’ house, so long des
 
 ___________________________
 
erted, there were now so many people
that almost all the rooms were occupied, and almost every day it
happened that the old princess, sitting down to table, counted them all
over, and put the thirteenth grandson or granddaughter at a separate
table. and kitty, with her careful housekeeping, had no little trouble
to get all the chickens, turkeys, and geese, of which so many were
needed to satisfy the summer appetites of the visitors and children.

the whole family were sitting at dinner. dolly’s children, with their
governess and varenka, were making plans for going to look for
mushrooms. sergey ivanovitch, who was looked up to by all the party for
his intellect and learning, with a respect that almost amounted to awe,
surprised everyone by joining
 
 ___________________________
 
 in the conversation about mushrooms.

"take me with you. i am very fond of picking mushrooms," he said,
looking at varenka; "i think it’s a very nice occupation."

"oh, we shall be delighted," answered varenka, coloring a little. kitty
exchanged meaningful glances with dolly. the proposal of the learned and
intellectual sergey ivanovitch to go looking for mushrooms with varenka
confirmed certain theories of kitty’s with which her mind had been very
busy of late. she made haste to address some remark to her mother, so
that her look should not be noticed. after dinner sergey ivanovitch sat
with his cup of coffee at the drawing-room window, and while he took
part in a conversation he had begun with his brother, he watched the
door through which the children would start on the mushroom-picking
expedition. levin was sitting in the window near his brother.

kitty stood beside her husband, evidently awaiting
 
 ___________________________
 
 the end of a
conversation that had no interest for her, in order to tell him
something.

"you have changed in many respects since your marriage, and for the
better," said sergey ivanovitch, smiling to kitty, and obviously little
interested in the conversation, "but you have remained true to your
passion for defending the most paradoxical theories."

"katya, it’s not good for you to stand," her husband said to her,
putting a chair for her and looking significantly at her.

"oh, and there’s no time either," added sergey ivanovitch, seeing the
children running out.

at the head of them all tanya galloped sideways, in her tightly-drawn
stockings, and waving a basket and sergey ivanovitch’s hat,

im, softening her freedom by a shy and friendly smile.

"varenka’s waiting," she said, carefully putting his hat on, seeing from
sergey ivanovitch’s smile that she might do so.

varenka was standing at the door, dressed in a yellow print gown, with a
white kerchief on her head.

"i’m coming, i’m coming, varvara andreevna," said sergey ivanovitch,
finishing his cup of coffee, and putting into their separate pockets his
handkerchief and cigar-case.

"and how sweet my varenka is! eh?" said kitty to her husband, as soon as
sergey ivanovitch rose. she spoke so that sergey ivanovitch could hear,
and it was clear that she meant him to do so. "and how good-looking she
is—such a refined beauty! varenka!" kitty shouted. "shall you be in the
mill copse? we’ll come out to you."

"you certainly forget your condition, kitty," said the old princess,
hurriedly coming out at the door. "you mustn’t shout like that."

varenka, hearing kitty’s voice and her mother’s reprimand, went with
light

, rapid steps up to kitty. the rapidity of her movement, her
flushed and eager face, everything betrayed that something out of the
common was going on in her. kitty knew what this was, and had been
watching her intently. she called varenka at that moment merely in order
mentally to give her a blessing for the important event which, as kitty
fancied, was bound to come to pass that day after dinner in the wood.

"varenka, i should be very happy if a certain something were to happen,"
she whispered as she kissed her.

"and are you coming with us?" varenka said to levin in confusion,
pretending not to have heard what had been said.

"i am coming, but only as far as the threshing-floor, and there i shall
stop."

"why, what do you want there?" said kitty.

"i must go to have a look at the new wagons, and to check the invoice,"

n; "and where will you be?"

"on the terrace."



chapter 2


on the terrace were assembled all the ladies of the party. they always
liked sitting there after dinner, and that day they had work to do there
too. besides the sewing and knitting of baby clothes, with which all of
them were busy, that afternoon jam was being made on the terrace by a
method new to agafea mihalovna, without the addition of water. kitty had
introduced this new method, which had been in use in her home. agafea
mihalovna, to whom the task of jam-making had always been intrusted,
considering that what had been done in the levin household could not be
amiss, had nevertheless put water with the strawberries, maintaining
that the jam could not be made without it. she had been caught in the
act, and was now making jam before everyone, and it was to be proved to
her conclusively that jam could be very well made without water.

agafea

sponsible for the raspberry jam-making, tried to appear to be
absorbed in other things and not interested in the jam, talked of other
matters, but cast stealthy glances in the direction of the stove.

"i always buy my maids’ dresses myself, of some cheap material," the
princess said, continuing the previous conversation. "isn’t it time to
skim it, my dear?" she added, addressing agafea mihalovna. "there’s not
the slightest need for you to do it, and it’s hot for you," she said,
stopping kitty.

"i’ll do it," said dolly, and getting up, she carefully passed the spoon
over the frothing sugar, and from time to time shook off the clinging
jam from the spoon by knocking it on a plate that was covered with
yellow-red scum and blood-colored syrup. "how they’ll enjoy this at
tea-time!" she thought of her children, remembering how she herself as a
child had wondered how it was the grown-up people did not eat what was
best of all—the scum of the jam.

"stiva says it’s much better to g

ive money." dolly took up meanwhile the
weighty subject under discussion, what presents should be made to
servants. "but..."

"money’s out of the question!" the princess and kitty exclaimed with one
voice. "they appreciate a present..."

"well, last year, for instance, i bought our matrona semyenovna, not a
poplin, but something of that sort," said the princess.

"i remember she was wearing it on your nameday."

"a charming pattern—so simple and refined,—i should have liked it
myself, if she hadn’t had it. something like varenka’s. so pretty and
inexpensive."

"well, now i think it’s done," said dolly, dropping the syrup from the
spoon.

"when it sets as it dro

ps, it’s ready. cook it a little longer, agafea
mihalovna."

"the flies!" said agafea mihalovna angrily. "it’ll be just the same,"
she added.

"ah! how sweet it is! don’t frighten it!" kitty said suddenly, looking
at a sparrow that had settled on the step and was pecking at the center
of a raspberry.

"yes, but you keep a little further from the stove," said her mother.

"_à propos de varenka_," said kitty, speaking in french, as they had
been doing all the while, so that agafea mihalovna should not understand
them, "you know, mamma, i somehow expect things to be settled today. you
know what i mean. how splendid it would be!"

"but what a famous matchmaker she is!" said dolly. "how carefully and
cleverly she throws them together!..."

"no; tell me, mamma, what do you think?"

"why, what is one to think? he" (_he_ meant sergey ivanovitch) "might at
any time have been a match for anyone in russia;

"oh, no, mamma, do understand why, for him and for her too, nothing
better could be imagined. in the first place, she’s charming!" said
kitty, crooking one of her fingers.

"he thinks her very attractive, that’s certain," assented dolly.

"then he occupies such a position in society that he has no need to look
for either fortune or position in his wife. all he needs is a good,
sweet wife—a restful one."

"well, with her he would certainly be restful," dolly assented.

"thirdly, that she should love him. and so it is ... that is, it would
be so splendid!... i look forward to seeing them coming out of the
forest—and everything se

should be so delighted! what do you think, dolly?"

"but don’t excite yourself. it’s not at all the thing for you to be
excited," said her mother.

"oh, i’m not excited, mamma. i fancy he will make her an offer today."

"ah, that’s so strange, how and when a man makes an offer!... there is a
sort of barrier, and all at once it’s broken down," said dolly, smiling
pensively and recalling her past with stepan arkadyevitch.

"mamma, how did papa make you an offer?" kitty asked suddenly.

"there was nothing out of the way, it was very simple," answered the
princess, but her face beamed all over at the recollection.

"oh, but how was it? you loved him, anyway, before you were allowed to
speak?"

kitty felt a peculiar pleasure in being able now to talk to her mother
on equal terms about those questions of such paramount interest in a
woman’s life.

"of course i did; he had come to stay with us in the country."

"but how was it settled between you, mamma?"

"you

imagine, i dare say, that you invented something quite new? it’s
always just the same: it was settled by the eyes, by smiles..."

"how nicely you said that, mamma! it’s just by the eyes, by smiles that
it’s done," dolly assented.

"but what words did he say?"

"what did kostya say to you?"

"he wrote it in chalk. it was wonderful.... how long ago it seems!" she
said.

and the three women all fell to musing on the same thing. kitty was the
first to break the silence. she remembered all that last winter before
her marriage, and her passion for vronsky.

"there’s one thing ... that old love affair of varenka’s," she said, a
natural chain of ideas bringing her to this point. "i should have liked
to say something to sergey ivanovitch, to prepare him. they’re all—all
men, i mean," she added, "awfully jealous over our past."

"not all," said dolly. "you judge by your own husband. it makes him
miserable even now to remem

ber vronsky. eh? that’s true, isn’t it?"

"yes," kitty answered, a pensive smile in her eyes.

"but i really don’t know," the mother put in in defense of her motherly
care of her daughter, "what there was in your past that could worry him?
that vronsky paid you attentions—that happens to every girl."

"oh, yes, but we didn’t mean that," kitty said, flushing a little.

"no, let me speak," her mother went on, "why, you yourself would not let
me have a talk to vronsky. don’t you remember?"

"oh, mamma!" said kitty, with an expression of suffering.

"there’s no keeping you young people in check nowadays.... your
friendship could not have gone beyond what was suitable. i should myself
have called upon him to explain himself. but, my darling, it’s not right
for you to be agitated. please remember that, and calm yourself."

"i’m pe
 
 ___________________________
 
rfectly calm, maman."

"how happy it was for kitty that anna came then," said dolly, "and how
unhappy for her. it turned out quite the opposite," she said, struck by
her own ideas. "then anna was so happy, and kitty thought herself
unhappy. now it is just the opposite. i often think of her."

"a nice person to think about! horrid, repulsive woman—no heart," said
her mother, who could not forget that kitty had married not vronsky, but
levin.

"what do you want to talk of it for?" kitty said with annoyance. "i
never think about it, and i don’t want to think of it.... and i don’t
want to think of it," she said, catching the sound of her husband’s
well-known step on the steps of the terrace.

"what’s that you don’t want to think about?" inquired levin, coming onto
the terrace.

but no one answered him, and he did not repeat the question.

"i’m sorry i’ve broken in on your feminine parliament," he said, looking
round on every one discontentedly, and perceiving that 
 
 ___________________________
 
they had been
talking of something which they would not talk about before him.

for a second he felt that he was sharing the feeling of agafea
mihalovna, vexation at their making jam without water, and altogether at
the outside shtcherbatsky element. he smiled, however, and went up to
kitty.

"well, how are you?" he asked her, looking at her with the expression
with which everyone looked at her now.

"oh, very well," said kitty, smiling, "and how have things gone with
you?"

"the wagons held three times as much as the old carts did. well, are we
going for the children? i’ve ordered the horses to be put in."

"what! you want to take kitty in the wagonette?" her mother said
reproachfully.

"yes, at a walking pace, princess."

levin never called the princess "maman" as men often do call their
mothers-in-law, and the princess disliked his not doing so. but though
he liked and respected the princess, levin could not call
 
 ___________________________
 
 her so without
a sense of profaning his feeling for his dead mother.

"come with us, maman," said kitty.

"i don’t like to see such imprudence."

"well, i’ll walk then, i’m so well." kitty got up and went to her
husband and took his hand.

"you may be well, but everything in moderation," said the princess.

"well, agafea mihalovna, is the jam done?" said levin, smiling to agafea
mihalovna, and trying to cheer her up. "is it all right in the new way?"

"i suppose it’s all right. for our notions it’s boiled too long."

"it’ll be all the better, agafea mihalovna, it won’t mildew, even though
our ice has begun to thaw already, so that we’ve no cool cellar to store
it," said
 
 ___________________________
 
 kitty, at once divining her husband’s motive, and addressing
the old housekeeper with the same feeling; "but your pickle’s so good,
that mamma says she never tasted any like it," she added, smiling, and
putting her kerchief straight.

agafea mihalovna looked angrily at kitty.

"you needn’t try to console me, mistress. i need only to look at you
with him, and i feel happy," she said, and something in the rough
familiarity of that _with him_ touched kitty.

"come along with us to look for mushrooms, you will show us the best
places." agafea mihalovna smiled and shook her head, as though to say:
"i should like to be angry with you too, but i can’t."

"do it, please, by my receipt," said the princess; "put some paper over
the jam, and moisten it with a little rum, and without even ice, it will
never go mildewy."

d for me. she is altogether
spiritual."

"oh, no, he is so fond of you, and i am always so glad when my people
like you...."

"yes, he’s very nice to me; but..."

"it’s not as it was with poor nikolay ... you really cared for each
other," levin finished. "why not speak of him?" he added. "i sometimes
blame myself for not; it ends in one’s forgetting. ah, how terrible and
dear he was!... yes, what were we talking about?" levin said, after a
pause.

"you think he can’t fall in love," said kitty, translating into her own
language.

"it’s not so much that he can’t fall in love," levin said, smiling, "but
he has not the weakness necessary.... i’ve always envied him, and even
now, when i’m so happy, i still envy him."

"you envy him for not being able to fall in love?"

"i envy him for being better than i," said levin. "he does not live for
himself. his whole life is subordinated to his duty. and that’s why he
can be calm and contented."

"and you?" kitty asked, with an ironical
 
 ___________________________
 
 and loving smile.

she could never have explained the chain of thought that made her smile;
but the last link in it was that her husband, in exalting his brother
and abasing himself, was not quite sincere. kitty knew that this
insincerity came from his love for his brother, from his sense of shame
at being too happy, and above all from his unflagging craving to be
better—she loved it in him, and so she smiled.

"and you? what are you dissatisfied with?" she asked, with the same
smile.

her disbelief in his self-dissatisfaction delighted him, and
unconsciously he tried to draw her into giving utterance to the grounds
of her disbelief.

"i am happy, but dissatisfied with myself..." he said.

"why, how 
 
 ___________________________
 
can you be dissatisfied with yourself if you are happy?"

"well, how shall i say?... in my heart i really care for nothing
whatever but that you should not stumble—see? oh, but really you mustn’t
skip about like that!" he cried, breaking off to scold her for too agile
a movement in stepping over a branch that lay in the path. "but when i
think about myself, and compare myself with others, especially with my
brother, i feel i’m a poor creature."

"but in what way?" kitty pursued with the same smile. "don’t you too
work for others? what about your co-operative settlement, and your work
on the estate, and your book?..."

"oh, but i feel, and particularly just now—it’s your fault," he said,
pressing her hand—"that all that doesn’t count. i do it in a way
halfheartedly. if i could care for all that as i care for you!...
instead of that, i do it in these days like a task that is set me."

"well, what would you say about papa?" asked kitty. "is he a poor

put all my energies into work; now i can’t, and i’m ashamed; i do it
just as though it were a task set me, i’m pretending...."

"well, but would you like to change this minute with sergey ivanovitch?"
said kitty. "would you like to do this work for the general good, and to
love the task set you, as he does, and nothing else?"

"of course not," said levin. "but i’m so happy that i don’t understand
anything. so you think he’ll make her an offer today?" he added after a
brief silence.

"i think so, and i don’t think so. only, i’m awfully anxious for it.

edge of the path. "come, count: he does propose, he doesn’t," she sai

giving him the flower.

"he does, he doesn’t," said levin, tearing off the white petals.

"no, no!" kitty, snatching at his hand, stopped him. she had been
watching his fingers with interest. "you picked off two."

"oh, but see, this little one shan’t count to make up," said levin,
tearing off a little half-grown petal. "here’s the wagonette overtaking
us."

"aren’t you tired, kitty?" called the princess.

"not in the least."

"if you are you can get in, as the horses are quiet and walking."

but it was not worth while to get in, they were quite near the place,
and all walked on together.



chapter 4


varenka, with her white kerchief on her black hair, surrounded by the
children, gaily and good-humoredly looking after them, and at the same
time visibly excited at the possibility of receiving a declaration from
the man she cared for, was very attractive. sergey ivanovitch

child; and if she loved him, she
loved him consciously as a woman ought to love; that was one thing.
another point: she was not only far from being worldly, but had an
unmistakable distaste for worldly society, and at the same time she knew
the world, and had all the ways of a woman of the best society, which
were absolutely essential to sergey ivanovitch’s conception of the woman
who was to share his life. thirdly: she was religious, and not like a
child, unconsciously religious and good, as kitty, for example, was, but
her life was founded on religious principles. even in trifling matters,
sergey ivanovitch found in her all that he wanted in his wife: she was
poor and alone in the world, so she would not bring with her a mass of
relations and their influence into her husband’s house, as he saw now in
kitty’s case. she would owe everything to her husband, which was what he
had always desired too for his future family life. and this girl, who
united all these qualities, loved him. he

ore and ashamed; at the same time she had a
sense of relief.

when he had got home again and went over the whole subject, sergey
ivanovitch thought his previous decision had been a mistaken one. he
could not be false to the memory of marie.

"gently, children, gently!" levin shouted quite angrily to the children,
standing before his wife to protect her when the crowd of children flew
with shrieks of delight to meet them.

behind the children sergey ivanovitch and varenka walked out of the
wood. kitty had no need to ask varenka; she saw from the calm and
somewhat crestfallen faces of both that her plans had not come off.

"well?" her husband questioned her as they were going home again.

"it doesn’t bite," said kitty, her smile and manner of speaking
recalling her father, a likeness levin often noticed with pleasure.

"how doesn’t bite?"

"i’ll show you," she said, taking her husband’s hand, lifting it to her
mouth, and just faintly brushing it with closed lips. "like a kiss on a

balcony and talked as though nothing had happened, though they all,
especially sergey ivanovitch and varenka, were very well aware that
there had happened an event which, though negative, was of very great
importance. they both had the same feeling, rather like that of a
schoolboy after an examination, which has left him in the same class or
shut him out of the school forever. everyone present, feeling too that
something had happened, talked eagerly about extraneous subjects. levin
and kitty were particularly happy and conscious of their love that
evening. and their happiness in their love seemed to imply a
disagreeable slur on those who would have liked to feel the same and
could not—and they felt a prick of conscience.

"mark my words, alexander will not come," said the old princess.

that evening they were expecting stepan arkadyevitch to come down by
train, and the old prince had written that possibly he might come too.

"and i know why," the princess went on; "he says that y
 
 ___________________________
 
oung people ought
to be left alone for a while at first."

"but papa has left us alone. we’ve never seen him," said kitty.
"besides, we’re not young people!—we’re old, married people by now."

"only if he doesn’t come, i shall say good-bye to you children," said
the princess, sighing mournfully.

"what nonsense, mamma!" both the daughters fell upon her at once.

"how do you suppose he is feeling? why, now..."

and suddenly there was an unexpected quiver in the princess’s voice. her
daughters were silent, and looked at one another. "maman always finds
something to be miserable about," they said in that gl

ance. they did not
know that happy as the princess was in her daughter’s house, and useful
as she felt herself to be there, she had been extremely miserable, both
on her own account and her husband’s, ever since they had married their
last and favorite daughter, and the old home had been left empty.

"what is it, agafea mihalovna?" kitty asked suddenly of agafea
mihalovna, who was standing with a mysterious air, and a face full of
meaning.

"about supper."

"well, that’s right," said dolly; "you go and arrange about it, and i’ll
go and hear grisha repeat his lesson, or else he will have nothing done
all day."

"that’s my lesson! no, dolly, i’m going," said levin, jumping up.

grisha, who was by now at a high school, had to go over the lessons of
the term in the summer holidays. darya alexandrovna, who had been
studying

ildren so
badly. but he promised his sister-in-law to give the lessons exactly as
she wished. and he went on teaching grisha, not in his own way, but by
the book, and so took little interest in it, and often forgot the hour
of the lesson. so it had been today.

"no, i’m going, dolly, you sit still," he said. "we’ll do it all
properly, like the book. only when stiva comes, and we go out shooting,
then we shall have to miss it."

and levin went to grisha.

varenka was saying the same thing to kitty. even in the happy,
well-ordered household of the levins varenka had succeeded in making
herself useful.

"i’ll see to the supper, you sit still," she said, and got up to go to
agafea mihalovna.

"yes, yes, most likely they’ve not been able to get chickens. if so,
ours..."

"agafea mihalovna and i will see about it," and varenka vanished with
her.

"what a nice girl!" said the princess.

"not nice, maman; she’s an exquisite girl; there’s no one else like
her."

"so you are expecting ste
 
 ___________________________
 
lt to find two sons-in-law more unlike than
yours," he said with a subtle smile. "one all movement, only living in
society, like a fish in water; the other our kostya, lively, alert,
quick in everything, but as soon as he is in society, he either sinks
into apathy, or struggles helplessly like a fish on land."

"yes, he’s very heedless," said the princess, addressing sergey
ivanovitch. "i’ve been meaning, indeed, to ask you to tell him that it’s
out of the question for her" (she indicated kitty) "to stay here; that
she positively must come to moscow. he talks of getting a doctor
down..."

"maman, he’ll do everything; he has agreed to everything," kitty said,
angry with her mother for appealing to sergey ivanovitch to judge in
such a matter.

in the middle of their conversation they heard the snorting of horses
and the sound of wheels on the gravel. dolly had not time to get up to
go and meet her husband, when from the window of the room below, where
grisha was having his lesson, lev
 
 ___________________________
 
in leaped out and helped grisha out
after him.

"it’s stiva!" levin shouted from under the balcony. "we’ve finished,
dolly, don’t be afraid!" he added, and started running like a boy to
meet the carriage.

"_is ea id, ejus, ejus, ejus!_" shouted grisha, skipping along the
avenue.

"and some one else too! papa, of course!" cried levin, stopping at the
entrance of the avenue. "kitty, don’t come down the steep staircase, go
round."

but levin had been mistaken in taking the person sitting in the carriage
for the old prince. as he got nearer to the carriage he saw beside
stepan arkadyevitch not the prince but a handsome, stout young man in a
scotch cap, with long ends of ribbon behind. this was vassenka
veslovsky, a distant cousin of the shtcherbatskys, a brilliant young
gentleman in petersburg and moscow society. "a capital fellow, and a
keen sportsman," as stepan arkadye

into the carriage, but walked behind. he was rather
vexed at the non-arrival of the old prince, whom he liked more and more
the more he saw of him, and also at the arrival of this vassenka
veslovsky, a quite uncongenial and superfluous person. he seemed to him
still more uncongenial and superfluous when, on approaching the steps
where the whole party, children and grown-up, were gathered together in
much excitement, levin saw vassenka veslovsky, with a particularly warm
and gallant air, kissing kitty’s hand.

"your wife and i are cousins and very old friends," said vassenka
veslovsky, once more shaking levin’s hand with great warmth.

"well, are there plenty of birds?" stepan arkadyevitch said to levin,
hardly leaving time for everyone to utter their greetings. "we’ve come
with the most savage intentions. why, maman, they’ve not been in moscow
since! look, tanya, here’s something for you! get it, please, it’s in
the carriage, behind!" he talked in all directions. "how pretty you

his ribbons, just as though she were in her own house.

even sergey ivanovitch, who had come out too onto the steps, seemed to
him unpleasant with the show of cordiality with which he met stepan
arkadyevitch, though levin knew that his brother neither liked nor
respected oblonsky.

and varenka, even she seemed hateful, with her air _sainte nitouche_
making the acquaintance of this gentleman, while all the while she was
thinking of nothing but getting married.

and more hateful than anyone was kitty for falling in with the tone of
gaiety with which this gentleman regarded his visit in the country, as
though it were a holiday for himself and everyone else. and, above all,
unpleasant was that particular smile with which she responded to his
smile.

noisily talking, they all went into the house; but as soon as they were
all seated, levin turned and went out.

kitty saw something was wrong with her husband. she tried to seize a
moment to speak to him alone, but he made haste to get away from h

er,
saying he was wanted at the counting-house. it was long since his own
work on the estate had seemed to him so important as at that moment.
"it’s all holiday for them," he thought; "but these are no holiday
matters, they won’t wait, and there’s no living without them."



chapter 7


levin came back to the house only when they sent to summon him to
supper. on the stairs were standing kitty and agafea mihalovna,
consulting about wines for supper.

"but why are you making all this fuss? have what we usually do."

"no, stiva doesn’t drink ... kostya, stop, what’s the matter?" kitty
began, hurrying after him, but he strode ruthlessly away to the dining
room without waiting for her, and at once joined in the lively general
conversation which was being maintained there by vassenka veslovsky and
stepan arkadyevitch.

"well, what do you say, are we going shooting tomorrow?" said step

an
arkadyevitch.

"please, do let’s go," said veslovsky, moving to another chair, where he
sat down sideways, with one fat leg crossed under him.

"i shall be delighted, we will go. and have you had any shooting yet
this year?" said levin to veslovsky, looking intently at his leg, but
speaking with that forced amiability that kitty knew so well in him, and
that was so out of keeping with him. "i can’t answer for our finding
grouse, but there are plenty of snipe. only we ought to start early.
you’re not tired? aren’t you tired, stiva?"

"me tired? i’ve never been tired yet. suppose we stay up all night.
let’s go for a walk!"

"yes, really, let’s not go to bed at all! capital!" veslovsky chimed in.

"oh, we all know you can do without sleep, and keep other people up
too," dolly said to her husband, with that fai
 
 ___________________________
 
ime for bed now.... i’m going, i don’t want supper."

"no, do stay a little, dolly," said stepan arkadyevitch, going round to
her side behind the table where they were having supper. "i’ve so much
still to tell you."

"nothing really, i suppose."

"do you know veslovsky has been at anna’s, and he’s going to them again?
you know they’re hardly fifty miles from you, and i too must certainly
go over there. veslovsky, come here!"

vassenka crossed over to the ladies, and sat down beside kitty.

"ah, do tell me, please; you have stayed with her? how was she?" darya
alexandrovna appealed to him.

levin was left at the other end of the table, and though never pausing
in his conversation with the princess and varenka, he saw that there was
an eager and mysterious conversation going on between stepan
arkadyevitch, dolly, kitty, and veslovsky. and that was not all. he saw
on his wife’s face an expression of real feeling as she gazed with fixed
eyes on the handsome face of vassenka, who

ould be for us all to go over to them together! when are
you going there?" stepan arkadyevitch asked vassenka.

"i’m spending july there."

"will you go?" stepan arkadyevitch said to his wife.

"i’ve been wanting to a long while; i shall certainly go," said dolly.
"i am sorry for her, and i know her. she’s a splendid woman. i will go
alone, when you go back, and then i shall be in no one’s way. and it
will be better indeed without you."

"to be sure," said stepan arkadyevitch. "and you, kitty?"

"i? why should i go?" kitty said, flushing all over, and she glanced
round at her husband.

"do you know anna arkadyevna, then?" veslovsky asked her. "she’s a very
fascinating woman."

"yes," she answered veslovsky, crimsoning still more. she got up and
walked across to her husband.

"are you going shooting, then, tomorrow?" she said.

his jealousy had in these few moments, especially at the flush that had
overspread her cheeks while she was talking to veslovsky, gone far
indeed. now as he

nstrued them in his own fashion.
strange as it was to him afterwards to recall it, it seemed to him at
the moment clear that in asking whether he was going shooting, all she
cared to know was whether he would give that pleasure to vassenka
veslovsky, with whom, as he fancied, she was in love.

"yes, i’m going," he answered her in an unnatural voice, disagreeable to
himself.

"no, better spend the day here tomorrow, or dolly won’t see anything of
her husband, and set off the day after," said kitty.

the motive of kitty’s words was interpreted by levin thus: "don’t
separate me from _him_. i don’t care about _your_ going, but do let me
enjoy the society of this delightful young man."

"oh, if you wish, we’ll stay here tomorrow," levin answered, with
peculiar amiability.

vassenka meanwhile, utterly unsuspecting the misery his presence had
occasioned, got up from the table after kitty, and watching her with
smiling and admiring eyes, he followed her.

levin saw that look. he turned

r, and again crossing his leg as his habit was.

levin’s jealousy went further still. already he saw himself a deceived
husband, looked upon by his wife and her lover as simply necessary to
provide them with the conveniences and pleasures of life.... but in
spite of that he made polite and hospitable inquiries of vassenka about
his shooting, his gun, and his boots, and agreed to go shooting next
day.

happily for levin, the old princess cut short his agonies by getting up
herself and advising kitty to go to bed. but even at this point levin
could not escape another agony. as he said good-night to his hostess,
vassenka would again have kissed her hand, but kitty, reddening, drew
back her hand and said with a naïve bluntness, for which the old
princess scolded her afterwards:

"we don’t like that fashion."

in levin’s eyes she was to blame for having allowed such relations to
arise, and still more to blame for showing so awkwardly that she did not
like them.

"why, how can one want to 
 
 ___________________________
 
go to bed!" said stepan arkadyevitch, who,
after drinking several glasses of wine at supper, was now in his most
charming and sentimental humor. "look, kitty," he said, pointing to the
moon, which had just risen behind the lime trees—"how exquisite!
veslovsky, this is the time for a serenade. you know, he has a splendid
voice; we practiced songs together along the road. he has brought some
lovely songs with him, two new ones. varvara andreevna and he must sing
some duets."

when the party had broken up, stepan arkadyevitch walked a long while
about the avenue with veslovsky; their voices could be heard singing one
of the new songs.

levin hearing

expression
of his face would have been grim, and even cruel, if it had not at the
same time had a look of suffering which touched her. his jaws were
twitching, and his voice kept breaking.

"you must understand that i’m not jealous, that’s a nasty word. i can’t
be jealous, and believe that.... i can’t say what i feel, but this is
awful.... i’m not jealous, but i’m wounded, humiliated that anybody dare
think, that anybody dare look at you with eyes like that."

"eyes like what?" said kitty, trying as conscientiously as possible to
recall every word and gesture of that evening and every shade implied in
them.

at the very bottom of her heart she did think there had been something
precisely at the moment when he had crossed over after her to the other
end of the table; but she dared not own it even to herself, and would
have been even more unable to bring herself to say so to him, and so
increase his suffering.

"and what can there possibly be attractive about me as i am now?..."

he would readily have sacrificed, not merely
such trifles, but everything, for his peace of mind, to save him from
the agony he was suffering.

"you must understand the horror and comedy of my position," he went on
in a desperate whisper; "that he’s in my house, that he’s done nothing
improper positively except his free and easy airs and the way he sits on
his legs. he thinks it’s the best possible form, and so i’m obliged to
be civil to him."

"but, kostya, you’re exaggerating," said kitty, at the bottom of her
heart rejoicing at the depth of his love for her, shown now in his
jealousy.

"the most awful part of it all is that you’re just as you always are,
and especially now when to me you’re something sacred, and we’re so
happy, so particularly happy—and all of a sudden a little wretch....
he’s not a little wretch; why should i abuse him? i have nothing to do
with him. but why should my, and your, happiness..."

"well, what? what?"

"i saw how you looked while we were talking at supper."

"well, well!" levin said in dismay.

she told him what they had been talking about. and as she told him, she
was breathless with emotion. levin was silent for a space, then he
scanned her pale and distressed face, and suddenly he clutched at his
head.

"katya, i’ve been worrying you! darling, forgive me! it’s madness!
katya, i’m a criminal. and how could you be so distressed at such
idiocy?"

"oh

once more if she forgave him for his idiocy yesterday, and,
moreover, to beg her for christ’s sake to be more careful. the great
thing was for her to keep away from the children—they might any minute
push against her. then he had once more to hear her declare that she was
not angry with him for going away for two days, and to beg her to be
sure to send him a note next morning by a servant on horseback, to write
him, if it were but two words only, to let him know that all was well
with her.

kitty was distressed, as she always was, at parting for a couple of days
from her husband, but when she saw his eager figure, looking big and
strong in his shooting-boots and his white blouse, and a sort of
sportsman elation and excitement incomprehensible to her, she forgot her
own chagrin for the sake of his pleasure, and said good-bye to him
cheerfully.

"pardon, gentlemen!" he said, running out onto the steps. "have you put
the lunch in? why is the chestnut on the right? well, it doesn’t matter

laska’s method, wary and indefinite; he knew the place too and expected
a whole covey of snipe.

"veslovsky, beside me, walk beside me!" he said in a faint voice to his
companion splashing in the water behind him. levin could not help
feeling an interest in the direction his gun was pointed, after that
casual shot near the kolpensky marsh.

"oh, i won’t get in your way, don’t trouble about me."

but levin could not help troubling, and recalled kitty’s words at
parting: "mind you don’t shoot one another." the dogs came nearer and
nearer, passed each other, each pursuing its own scent. the expectation
of snipe was so intense that to levin the squelching sound of his own
heel, as he drew it up out of the mire, seemed to be the call of a
snipe, and he clutched and pressed the lock of his gun.

"bang! bang!" sounded almost in his ear. vassenka had fired at a flock
of ducks which was hovering over the marsh and flying at that moment

after he began snoring himself, and everything was still. he could only
hear the snort of the horses, and the guttural cry of a snipe.

"is it really only negative?" he repeated to himself. "well, what of it?
it’s not my fault." and he began thinking about the next day.

"tomorrow i’ll go out early, and i’ll make a point of keeping cool.
there are lots of snipe; and there are grouse too. when i come back
there’ll be the note from kitty. yes, stiva may be right, i’m not manly
with her, i’m tied to her apron-strings.... well, it can’t be helped!
negative again...."

half asleep, he heard the laughter and mirthful talk of veslovsky and
stepan arkadyevitch. for an instant he opened his eyes: the moon was up,
and in the open doorway, brightly lighted up by the moonlight, they were
standing talking. stepan arkadyevitch was saying something of the
freshness of one girl, comparing her to a freshly peeled nut, and
veslovsky with

 would not go into the
game bag. his companions had long been awake, and had had time to get
hungry and have breakfast.

"wait a bit, wait a bit, i know there are nineteen," said levin,
counting a second time over the grouse and snipe, that looked so much
less important now, bent and dry and bloodstained, with heads crooked
aside, than they did when they were flying.

the number was verified, and stepan arkadyevitch’s envy pleased levin.
he was pleased too on returning to find the man sent by kitty with a
note was already there.

"i am perfectly well and happy. if you were uneasy about me, you can
feel easier than ever. i’ve a new bodyguard, marya vlasyevna,"—this was
the midwife, a new and important personage in levin’s domestic life.
"she has come to have a look at me. she found me perfectly well, and we
have kept her till you are back. all are happy and well, and please,
don’t be in a hurry to come back, but, if the sport is good, stay
another day."

ere so great that two slightly disagreeable incidents passed lightly
over levin. one was that the chestnut trace horse, who had been
unmistakably overworked on the previous day, was off his feed and out of
sorts. the coachman said he was "overdriven yesterday, konstantin
dmitrievitch. yes, indeed! driven ten miles with no sense!"

the other unpleasant incident, which for the first minute destroyed his
good humor, though later he laughed at it a great deal, was to find that
of all the provisions kitty had provided in such abundance that one
would have thought there was enough for a week, nothing was left. on his
way back, tired and hungry from shooting, levin had so distinct a vision
of meat-pies that as he approached the hut he seemed to smell and taste
them, as laska had smelt the game, and he immediately told philip to
give him some. it appeared that there were no pies left, nor even any
chicken.

"well, this fellow’s appetite!" said stepan arkadyevitch, laughing and
pointing at vassenk

 for shooting?"

"what will you take, tea or coffee?"

"neither. i’ll wait till lunch. i’m really ashamed. i suppose the ladies
are down? a walk now would be capital. you show me your horses."

after walking about the garden, visiting the stable, and even doing some
gymnastic exercises together on the parallel bars, levin returned to the
house with his guest, and went with him into the drawing room.

"we had splendid shooting, and so many delightful experiences!" said
veslovsky, going up to kitty, who was sitting at the samovar. "what a
pity ladies are cut off from these delights!"

"well, i suppose he must say something to the lady of the house," levin
said to himself. again he fancied something in the smile, in the
all-conquering air with which their guest addressed kitty....

the princess, sitting on the other side of the table with marya
vlasyevna and stepan arkadyevitch, called levin to her side, and began
to talk to him about moving to moscow for kitty’s confinement, and
getting
 
 ___________________________
 


but the princess did not understand his feelings, and put down his
reluctance to think and talk about it to carelessness and indifference,
and so she gave him no peace. she had commissioned stepan arkadyevitch
to look at a flat, and now she called levin up.

"i know nothing about it, princess. do as you think fit," he said.

"you must decide when you will move."

"i really don’t know. i know millions of children are born away from
moscow, and doctors ... why..."

"but if so..."

"oh, no, as kitty wishes."

"we can’t talk to kitty about it! do you want me to frighten her? why,
this spring natalia golitzina died from having an ignorant doctor."

"i will do just what you say," he said gloomily.

the princess began talking to him, but he did not hear her. though the
conversation with the princess had indeed jarred upon him, he was
gloomy, not on account of that conversation, but from what he saw at the
samovar.

"no, it’s impossible," he thought, glancing now and then at vassenka
bendin

g over kitty, telling her something with his charming smile, and
at her, flushed and disturbed.

there was something not nice in vassenka’s attitude, in his eyes, in his
smile. levin even saw something not nice in kitty’s attitude and look.
and again the light died away in his eyes. again, as before, all of a
sudden, without the slightest transition, he felt cast down from a
pinnacle of happiness, peace, and dignity, into an abyss of despair,
rage, and humiliation. again everything and everyone had become hateful
to him.

"you do just as you think best, princess," he said again, looking round.

"heavy is the cap of monomach," stepan arkadyevitch said playfully,
hinting, evidently, not simply at the princess

conversation, but at
the cause of levin’s agitation, which he had noticed.

"how late you are today, dolly!"

everyone got up to greet darya alexandrovna. vassenka only rose for an
instant, and with the lack of courtesy to ladies characteristic of the
modern young man, he scarcely bowed, and resumed his conversation again,
laughing at something.

"i’ve been worried about masha. she did not sleep well, and is
dreadfully tiresome today," said dolly.

the conversation vassenka had started with kitty was running on the same
lines as on the previous evening, discussing anna, and whether love is
to be put higher than worldly considerations. kitty disliked the
conversation, and she was disturbed both by the subject and the tone in
which it was conducted, and also by the knowledge of the effect it would
have on her husband. but she was too simple and innocent to know how to
cut short this conversation, or even to conceal the superficial pleasure
afforded her by the young man’s very obvious ad

he did not know what to do. whatever she did she knew
would be observed by her husband, and the worst interpretation put on
it. and, in fact, when she asked dolly what was wrong with masha, and
vassenka, waiting till this uninteresting conversation was over, began
to gaze indifferently at dolly, the question struck levin as an
unnatural and disgusting piece of hypocrisy.

"what do you say, shall we go and look for mushrooms today?" said dolly.

"by all means, please, and i shall come too," said kitty, and she
blushed. she wanted from politeness to ask vassenka whether he would
come, and she did not ask him. "where are you going, kostya?" she asked
her husband with a guilty face, as he passed by her with a resolute
step. this guilty air confirmed all his suspicions.

"the mechanician came when i was away; i haven’t seen him yet," he said,
not looking at her.

he went downstairs, but before he had time to leave his study he heard
his wife’s familiar footsteps running with reckless speed t

did not answer him, but walked out himself with his wife.

"well, what have you to say to me?" he said to her in french.

he did not look her in the face, and did not care to see that she in her
condition was trembling all over, and had a piteous, crushed look.

"i ... i want to say that we can’t go on like this; that this is
misery..." she said.

"the servants are here at the sideboard," he said angrily; "don’t make a
scene."

"well, let’s go in here!"

they were standing in the passage. kitty would have gone into the next
room, but there the english governess was giving tanya a lesson.

"well, come into the garden."

in the garden they came upon a peasant weeding the path. and no longer
considering that the peasant could see her tear-stained and his agitated
face, that they looked like people fleeing from some disaster, they went
on with rapid steps, feeling that they must speak out and clear up
misunderstandings, must be alone together, and so get rid of the misery

and darya alexandrovna described masha’s crime.

"that proves nothing; it’s not a question of evil propensities at all,
it’s simply mischief," levin assured her.

"but you are upset about something? what have you come for?" asked
dolly. "what’s going on there?"

and in the tone of her question levin heard that it would be easy for
him to say what he had meant to say.

"i’ve not been in there, i’ve been alone in the garden with kitty. we’ve
had a quarrel for the second time since ... stiva came."

dolly looked at him with her shrewd, comprehending eyes.

"come, tell me, honor bright, has there been ... not in kitty, but in
that gentleman’s behavior, a tone which might be unpleasant—not
unpleasant, but horrible, offensive to a husband?"

"you mean, how shall i say.... stay, stay in the corner!" she said to
masha, who, detecting a faint smile in her mother’s face, had been
turning round. "the opinion of the world woul

young men do behave. _il fait la cour à une jeune et jolie femme_, and a
husband who’s a man of the world should only be flattered by it."

"yes, yes," said levin gloomily; "but you noticed it?"

"not only i, but stiva noticed it. just after breakfast he said to me in
so many words, _je crois que veslovsky fait un petit brin de cour à
kitty_."

"well, that’s all right then; now i’m satisfied. i’ll send him away,"
said levin.

"what do you mean! are you crazy?" dolly cried in horror; "nonsense,
kostya, only think!" she said, laughing. "you can go now to fanny," she
said to masha. "no, if you wish it, i’ll speak to stiva. he’ll take him
away. he can say you’re expecting visitors. altogether he doesn’t fit
into the house."

"no, no, i’ll do it myself."

"but you’ll quarrel with him?"

astening the bottom hook, and smiling with simple-hearted good humor.

he was undoubtedly a good-natured fellow, and levin felt sorry for him
and ashamed of himself, as his host, when he saw the shy look on
vassenka’s face.

on the table lay a piece of stick which they had broken together that
morning, trying their strength. levin took the fragment in his hands and
began smashing it up, breaking bits off the stick, not knowing how to
begin.

"i wanted...." he paused, but suddenly, remembering kitty and everything
that had happened, he said, looking him resolutely in the face: "i have
ordered the horses to be put-to for you."

"how so?" vassenka began in surprise. "to drive where?"

"for you to drive to the station," levin said gloomily.

"are you going away, or has something happened?"

"it happens that i expect visitors," said levin, his strong fingers more
and more rapidly breaking off the ends of the split stick. "and i’m not
expecting visitors, and nothing has happened, but i beg yo

ter praised very highly, darya alexandrovna, at ten o’clock, went on
again. at home, looking after her children, she had no time to think. so
now, after this journey of four hours, all the thoughts she had
suppressed before rushed swarming into her brain, and she thought over
all her life as she never had before, and from the most different points
of view. her thoughts seemed strange even to herself. at first she
thought about the children, about whom she was uneasy, although the
princess and kitty (she reckoned more upon her) had promised to look
after them. "if only masha does not begin her naughty tricks, if grisha
isn’t kicked by a horse, and lily’s stomach isn’t upset again!" she
thought. but these questions of the present were succeeded by questions
of the immediate future. she began thinking how she had to get a new
flat in moscow for the coming winter, to renew the drawing room
furniture, and to make her elder girl a cloak. then questions of the
more remote future occurred t

working, nor nothing. only a tie."

this answer had struck darya alexandrovna as revolting in spite of the
good-natured and pleasing face of the young woman; but now she could not
help recalling these words. in those cynical words there was indeed a
grain of truth.

"yes, altogether," thought darya alexandrovna, looking back over her
whole existence during those fifteen years of her married life,
"pregnancy, sickness, mental incapacity, indifference to everything, and
most of all—hideousness. kitty, young and pretty as she is, even kitty
has lost her looks; and i when i’m with child become hideous, i know it.
the birth, the agony, the hideous agonies, that last moment ... then the
nursing, the sleepless nights, the fearful pains...."

darya alexandrovna shuddered at the mere recollection of the pain from
sore breasts which she had suffered with almost every child. "then the
children’s illnesses, that everlasting apprehension; then bringing them
up; evil propensities" (she thought of l

"and all this, what’s it for? what is to come of it all? that i’m
wasting my life, never having a moment’s peace, either with child, or
nursing a child, forever irritable, peevish, wretched myself and
worrying others, repulsive to my husband, while the children are growing
up unhappy, badly educated, and penniless. even now, if it weren’t for
spending the summer at the levins’, i don’t know how we should be
managing to live. of course kostya and kitty have so much tact that we
don’t feel it; but it can’t go on. they’ll have children, they won’t be
able to keep us; it’s a drag on them as it is. how is papa, who has
hardly anything left for himself, to help us? so that i can’t even bring
the children up by myself, and may find it hard with the help of other
people, at the cost of humiliation. why, even if we suppose the greatest

rovna made no answer, and merely stared at him with dismay.
when she was left alone with him, she suddenly felt afraid; his laughing
eyes and stern expression scared her.

the most diverse suppositions as to what he was about to speak of to her
flashed into her brain. "he is going to beg me to come to stay with them
with the children, and i shall have to refuse; or to create a set that
will receive anna in moscow.... or isn’t it vassenka veslovsky and his
relations with anna? or perhaps about kitty, that he feels he was to
blame?" all her conjectures were unpleasant, but she did not guess what
he really wanted to talk about to her.

"you have so much influence with anna, she is so fond of you," he said;
"do help me."

darya alexandrovna looked with timid inquiry into his energetic face,
which under the lime-trees was continually being lighted up in patches
by the sunshine, and then passing into complete shadow again. she waited
for him to say more, but he walked in silence beside her, scr

had stopped: "afterwards, by ourselves, we’ll talk about everything.
i’ve got so much i want to tell you," she said.

now they were by themselves, and anna did not know what to talk about.
she sat in the window looking at dolly, and going over in her own mind
all the stores of intimate talk which had seemed so inexhaustible
beforehand, and she found nothing. at that moment it seemed to her that
everything had been said already.

"well, what of kitty?" she said with a heavy sigh, looking penitently at
dolly. "tell me the truth, dolly: isn’t she angry with me?"

"angry? oh, no!" said darya alexandrovna, smiling.

"but she hates me, despises me?"

"oh, no! but you know that sort of thing isn’t forgiven."

"yes, yes," said anna, turning away and looking out of the open window.

"he’s much more than very nice. i don’t know a better man."

repeated.

dolly smiled.

"but tell me about yourself. we’ve a great deal to talk about. and i’ve

awkward to call him either the count or alexey kirillovitch.

explanation. it was the first time since the beginning of their intimacy
that he had parted from her without a full explanation. from one point
of view this troubled him, but on the other side he felt that it was
better so. "at first there will be, as this time, something undefined
kept back, and then she will get used to it. in any case i can give up
anything for her, but not my masculine independence," he thought.

in september levin moved to moscow for kitty’s confinement. he had spent
a whole month in moscow with nothing to do, when sergey ivanovitch, who
had property in the kashinsky province, and took great interest in the
question of the approaching elections, made ready to set off to the
elections. he invited his brother, who had a vote in the seleznevsky
district, to come with him. levin had, moreover, to transact in kashin
some extremely important business relating to the wardship of land and
to the receiving of certain redemption money fo

levin still hesitated, but kitty, who saw that he was bored in moscow,
and urged him to go, on her own authority ordered him the proper
nobleman’s uniform, costing seven pounds. and that seven pounds paid for
the uniform was the chief cause that finally decided levin to go. he
went to kashin....

levin had been six days in kashin, visiting the assembly each day, and
busily engaged about his sister’s business, which still dragged on. the

from the country, and his friendship with the governor, who was a

indeed. but what contributed more than all to his success was his
direct, equable manner with everyone, which very quickly made the
majority of the noblemen reverse the current opinion of his supposed
haughtiness. he was himself conscious that, except that whimsical
gentleman married to kitty shtcherbatskaya, who had _à propos de bottes_
poured out a stream of irrelevant absurdities with such spiteful fury,
every nobleman with whom he had made acquaintance had become his
adherent. he saw clearly, and other people recognized it, too, that he
had done a great deal to secure the success of nevyedovsky. and now at
his own table, celebrating nevyedovsky’s election, he was experiencing
an agreeable sense of triumph over the success of his candidate. the

chapter 1


the levins had been three months in moscow. the date had long passed on
which, according to the most trustworthy calculations of people learned
in such matters, kitty should have been confined. but she was still
about, and there was nothing to show that her time was any nearer than
two months ago. the doctor, the monthly nurse, and dolly and her mother,
and most of all levin, who could not think of the approaching event
without terror, began to be impatient and uneasy. kitty was the only
person who felt perfectly calm and happy.

she was distinctly conscious now of the birth of a new feeling of love
for the future child, for her to some extent actually exist

the town he seemed continually uneasy and on his guard, as though he
were afraid someone would be rude to him, and still more to her. at home
in the country, knowing himself distinctly to be in his right place, he
was never in haste to be off elsewhere. he was never unoccupied. here in
town he was in a continual hurry, as though afraid of missing something,
and yet he had nothing to do. and she felt sorry for him. to others, she
knew, he did not appear an object of pity. on the contrary, when kitty
looked at him in society, as one sometimes looks at those one loves,
trying to see him as if he were a stranger, so as to catch the
impression he must make on others, she saw with a panic even of jealous
fear that he was far indeed from being a pitiable figure, that he was
very attractive with his fine breeding, his rather old-fashioned,
reserved courtesy with women, his powerful figure, and striking, as she
thought, and expressive face. but she saw him not from without, but from
within; she sa

s ideas about it were muddled and had lost their
interest for him.

one advantage in this town life was that quarrels hardly ever happened
between them here in town. whether it was that their conditions were
different, or that they had both become more careful and sensible in
that respect, they had no quarrels in moscow from jealousy, which they
had so dreaded when they moved from the country.

one event, an event of great importance to both from that point of view,
did indeed happen—that was kitty’s meeting with vronsky.

the old princess marya borissovna, kitty’s godmother, who had always
been very fond of her, had insisted on seeing her. kitty, though she did
not go into society at all on account of her condition, went with her
father to see the venerable old lady, and there met vronsky.

the only thing kitty could reproach herself for at this meeting was that
at the instant when she recognized in his civilian dress the features
once so familiar to her, her breath failed her, the b

ushing, but that
afterwards she was just as direct and as much at her ease as with any
chance acquaintance, levin was quite happy again and said he was glad of
it, and would not now behave as stupidly as he had done at the election,
but would try the first time he met vronsky to be as friendly as
possible.

"it’s so wretched to feel that there’s a man almost an enemy whom it’s
painful to meet," said levin. "i’m very, very glad."

"go, please, go then and call on the bols," kitty said to her husband,
when he came in to see her at eleven o’clock before going out. "i know
you are dining at the club; papa put down your name. but what are you
going to do in the morning?"

"i am only going to katavasov," answered levin.

"why so early?"

"he promised to introduce me to metrov. i wanted to talk to him about my
work. he’s a distinguished scientific man from petersburg," said levin.

"yes; wasn’t it his article you were praising so? well, and after that?"
said kitty.

"but is it absolutely necessary?"

"oh, absolutely! he has been to see us. come, what is it? you go in, sit

"oh, you wouldn’t believe it! i’ve got so out of the way of all this
that it makes me feel positively ashamed. it’s such a horrible thing to
do! a complete outsider walks in, sits down, stays on with nothing to
do, wastes their time and worries himself, and walks away!"

kitty laughed.

"why, i suppose you used to pay calls before you were married, didn’t
you?"

"yes, i did, but i always felt ashamed, and now i’m so out of the way of
it that, by jove! i’d sooner go two days running without my dinner than
pay this call! one’s so ashamed! i feel all the while that they’re
annoyed, that they’re saying, ‘what has he come for?’"

"no, they won’t. i’ll answer for that," said kitty, looking into his
face with a laugh. she took his hand. "well, good-bye..

had grown used to it. that had happened to him in this matter which is
said to happen to drunkards—the first glass sticks in the throat, the
second flies down like a hawk, but after the third they’re like tiny
little birds. when levin had changed his first hundred-rouble note to
pay for liveries for his footmen and hall-porter he could not help
reflecting that these liveries were of no use to anyone—but they were
indubitably necessary, to judge by the amazement of the princess and
kitty when he suggested that they might do without liveries,—that these
liveries would cost the wages of two laborers for the summer, that is,
would pay for about three hundred working days from easter to ash
wednesday, and each a day of hard work from early morning to late
evening—and that hundred-rouble note did stick in his throat. but the
next note, changed to pay for providing a dinner for their relations,
that cost twenty-eight roubles, though it did excite in levin the
reflection that twen

expenditure he could not go on living for a year without debt, that even
had no force. only one thing was essential: to have money in the bank,
without inquiring where it came from, so as to know that one had the
wherewithal to buy meat for tomorrow. and this condition had hitherto
been fulfilled; he had always had the money in the bank. but now the
money in the bank had gone, and he could not quite tell where to get the
next installment. and this it was which, at the moment when kitty had
mentioned money, had disturbed him; but he had no time to think about
it. he drove off, thinking of katavasov and the meeting with metrov that
was before him.



chapter 3


levin had on this visit to town seen a great deal of his old friend at
the university, professor katavasov, whom he had not seen since his
marriage. he liked in katavasov the clearness and simplicity of his
conception of life. levin thought that the clearness of katavasov’s
conception of life was due to the poverty of

already told levin, and levin made the same remarks on his news that he
had already made that morning, but for the sake of variety he expressed
also a new opinion which had only just struck him. after that the
conversation turned again on the university question. as levin had
already heard it all, he made haste to tell metrov that he was sorry he
could not take advantage of his invitation, took leave, and drove to
lvov’s.



chapter 4


lvov, the husband of natalia, kitty’s sister, had spent all his life in
foreign capitals, where he had been educated, and had been in the
diplomatic service.

during the previous year he had left the diplomatic service, not owing
to any "unpleasantness" (he never had any "unpleasantness" with anyone),
and was transferred to the department of the court of the palace in
moscow, in order to give his two boys the best education possible.

in spite of the striking contrast in their habits and views and the fact
that lvov was older t

lvov, in a house coat with a belt and in chamois leather shoes, was
sitting in an armchair, and with a pince-nez with blue glasses he was
reading a book that stood on a reading desk, while in his beautiful hand
he held a half-burned cigarette daintily away from him.

his handsome, delicate, and still youthful-looking face, to which his
curly, glistening silvery hair gave a still more aristocratic air,
lighted up with a smile when he saw levin.

"capital! i was meaning to send to you. how’s kitty? sit here, it’s more
comfortable." he got up and pushed up a rocking chair. "have you read
the last circular in the _journal de st. petersbourg?_ i think it’s
excellent," he said, with a slight french accent.

levin told him what he had heard from katavasov was being said in
petersburg, and after talking a little about politics, he told him of
his interview with metrov, and the learned society’s meeting. to lvov it
was very interesting.

"that’s what i envy you, that you are able to mix

religion—you remember we talked about that—no father could bring
children up relying on his own strength alone without that help."

this subject, which always interested levin, was cut short by the
entrance of the beauty natalia alexandrovna, dressed to go out.

"i didn’t know you were here," she said, unmistakably feeling no regret,
but a positive pleasure, in interrupting this conversation on a topic
she had heard so much of that she was by now weary of it. "well, how is
kitty? i am dining with you today. i tell you what, arseny," she turned
to her husband, "you take the carriage."

and the husband and wife began to discuss their arrangements for the
day. as the husband had to drive to meet someone on official business,
while the wife had to go to the concert and some public meeting of a
committee on the eastern question, there was a great deal to consider
and settle. levin had to take part in their plans as one of themselves.
it was settled that levin should go with

 natalia to the concert and the
meeting, and that from there they should send the carriage to the office
for arseny, and he should call for her and take her to kitty’s; or that,
if he had not finished his work, he should send the carriage back and
levin would go with her.

"he’s spoiling me," lvov said to his wife; "he assures me that our
children are splendid, when i know how much that’s bad there is in
them."

"arseny goes to extremes, i always say," said his wife. "if you look for
perfection, you will never be satisfied. and it’s true, as papa
says,—that when we were brought up there was one extreme—we were kept in
the basement, while our par

levin would have liked to talk to them, to hear what they would say to
their father, but natalia began talking to him, and then lvov’s
colleague in the service, mahotin, walked in, wearing his court uniform,
to go with him to meet someone, and a conversation was kept up without a
break upon herzegovina, princess korzinskaya, the town council, and the
sudden death of madame apraksina.

levin even forgot the commission intrusted to him. he recollected it as
he was going into the hall.

"oh, kitty told me to talk to you about oblonsky," he said, as lvov was
standing on the stairs, seeing his wife and levin off.

"yes, yes, maman wants us, _les beaux-frères,_ to attack him," he said,
blushing. "but why should i?"

"well, then, i will attack him," said madame lvova, with a smile,
standing in her white sheepskin cape, waiting till they had finished
speaking. "come, let us go."



chapter 5


at the concert in the afternoon two very interesting things were
performed. one was a fantasia, _ki

air it would be to punish him by
exile abroad, levin repeated what he had heard the day before in
conversation from an acquaintance.

"i think sending him abroad is much the same as punishing a carp by
putting it into the water," said levin. then he recollected that this
idea, which he had heard from an acquaintance and uttered as his own,
came from a fable of krilov’s, and that the acquaintance had picked it
up from a newspaper article.

after driving home with his sister-in-law, and finding kitty in good
spirits and quite well, levin drove to the club.



chapter 7


levin reached the club just at the right time. members and visitors were
driving up as he arrived. levin had not been at the club for a very long
while—not since he lived in moscow, when he was leaving the university
and going into society. he remembered the club, the external details of
its arrangement, but he had completely forgotten the impression it had
made on him in old days. but as soon as, driving into the wide

all seemed to have left their cares and anxieties in the porter’s room
with their hats, and were all deliberately getting ready to enjoy the
material blessings of life. sviazhsky was here and shtcherbatsky,
nevyedovsky and the old prince, and vronsky and sergey ivanovitch.

"ah! why are you late?" the prince said smiling, and giving him his hand
over his own shoulder. "how’s kitty?" he added, smoothing out the napkin
he had tucked in at his waistcoat buttons.

"all right; they are dining at home, all the three of them."

"ah, ‘aline-nadine,’ to be sure! there’s no room with us. go to that
table, and make haste and take a seat," said the prince, and turning
away he carefully took a plate of eel soup.

"levin, this way!" a good-natured voice shouted a little farther on. it

use gates, that levin was
still under the influence of the club atmosphere of repose, comfort, and
unimpeachable good form. but as soon as the carriage drove out into the
street, and he felt it jolting over the uneven road, heard the angry
shout of a sledge driver coming towards them, saw in the uncertain light
the red blind of a tavern and the shops, this impression was dissipated,
and he began to think over his actions, and to wonder whether he was
doing right in going to see anna. what would kitty say? but stepan
arkadyevitch gave him no time for reflection, and, as though divining
his doubts, he scattered them.

"how glad i am," he said, "that you should know her! you know dolly has
long wished for it. and lvov’s been to see her, and often goes. though
she is my sister," stepan arkadyevitch pursued, "i don’t hesitate to say
that she’s a remarkable woman. but you will see. her position is very
painful, especially now."

"why especially now?"

account of how he had spent the evening.

"well, i’m very glad i met vronsky. i felt quite at ease and natural
with him. you understand, i shall try not to see him, but i’m glad that
this awkwardness is all over," he said, and remembering that by way of
trying not to see him, he had immediately gone to call on anna, he
blushed. "we talk about the peasants drinking; i don’t know which drinks
most, the peasantry or our own class; the peasants do on holidays,
but..."

but kitty took not the slightest interest in discussing the drinking
habits of the peasants. she saw that he blushed, and she wanted to know
why.

"well, and then where did you go?"

"stiva urged me awfully to go and see anna arkadyevna."

and as he said this, levin blushed even more, and his doubts as to
whether he had done right in going to see anna were settled once for
all. he knew now that he ought not to have done so.

kitty’s eyes opened in a curious way and gleamed at anna’s name, but

ling herself with an effort, she concealed her emotion and
deceived him.

"oh!" was all she said.

"i’m sure you won’t be angry at my going. stiva begged me to, and dolly
wished it," levin went on.

"oh, no!" she said, but he saw in her eyes a constraint that boded him
no good.

"she is a very sweet, very, very unhappy, good woman," he said, telling
her about anna, her occupations, and what she had told him to say to
her.

"yes, of course, she is very much to be pitied," said kitty, when he had
finished. "whom was your letter from?"

he told her, and believing in her calm tone, he went to change his coat.

coming back, he found kitty in the same easy chair. when he went up to
her, she glanced at him and broke into sobs.

"what? what is it?" he asked, knowing beforehand what.

"you’re in love with that hateful woman; she has bewitched you! i saw it
in your eyes. yes, yes! what can it all lead to? you were drinking at
the club, drinking and gambling, and then you went ...

walking up and down the room. she had unconsciously the whole evening
done her utmost to arouse in levin a feeling of love—as of late she had
fallen into doing with all young men—and she knew she had attained her
aim, as far as was possible in one evening, with a married and
conscientious man. she liked him indeed extremely, and, in spite of the
striking difference, from the masculine point of view, between vronsky
and levin, as a woman she saw something they had in common, which had
made kitty able to love both. yet as soon as he was out of the room, she
ceased to think of him.

one thought, and one only, pursued her in different forms, and refused
to be shaken off. "if i have so much effect on others, on this man, who
loves his home and his wife, why is it _he_ is so cold to me?... not
cold exactly, he loves me, i know that! but something new is drawing us
apart now. why wasn’t he here all the evening? he told stiva to say he
could not leave yashvin, and must watch over his play.

forming inappropriately friendly relations with a man with whom his wife
had once been in love, and a still more inappropriate call upon a woman
who could only be called a lost woman, after being fascinated by that
woman and causing his wife distress—he could still go quietly to sleep.
but under the influence of fatigue, a sleepless night, and the wine he
had drunk, his sleep was sound and untroubled.

at five o’clock the creak of a door opening waked him. he jumped up and
looked round. kitty was not in bed beside him. but there was a light
moving behind the screen, and he heard her steps.

"what is it?... what is it?" he said, half-asleep. "kitty! what is it?"

"nothing," she said, coming from behind the screen with a candle in her
hand. "i felt unwell," she said, smiling a particularly sweet and
meaning smile.

"what? has it begun?" he said in terror. "we ought to send..." and
hurriedly he reached after his clothes.

"no, no," she said, smiling and holding his hand. "it’s sure t

 her, as
he put on his dressing gown; then he stopped, still looking at her. he
had to go, but he could not tear himself from her eyes. he thought he
loved her face, knew her expression, her eyes, but never had he seen it
like this. how hateful and horrible he seemed to himself, thinking of
the distress he had caused her yesterday. her flushed face, fringed with
soft curling hair under her night cap, was radiant with joy and courage.

though there was so little that was complex or artificial in kitty’s
character in general, levin was struck by what was revealed now, when
suddenly all disguises were thrown off and the very kernel of her soul
shone in her eyes. and in this simplicity and nakedness of her soul,
she, the very woman he loved in her, was more manifest than ever. she
looked at him, smiling; but all at once her brows twitched, she threw up
her head, and going quickly up to him, clutched his hand and pressed
close up to him, breathing her hot breath upon him. she was in pain and

"i have sent to mamma. you go quickly to fetch lizaveta petrovna ...

she moved away from him and rang the bell.

"well, go now; pasha’s coming. i am all right."

and levin saw with astonishment that she had taken up the knitting she
had brought in in the night and begun working at it again.

as levin was going out of one door, he heard the maid-servant come in at
the other. he stood at the door and heard kitty giving exact directions
to the maid, and beginning to help her move the bedstead.

he dressed, and while they were putting in his horses, as a hired sledge
was not to be seen yet, he ran again up to the bedroom, not on tiptoe,
it seemed to him, but on wings. two maid-servants were carefully moving
something in the bedroom.

kitty was walking about knitting rapidly and giving directions.

"i’m going for the doctor. they have sent for lizaveta petrovna, but
i’ll go on there too. isn’t there

something. the doctor had answered and then had said something about the
irregularities in the municipal council. then he had been sent to the
bedroom to help the old princess to move the holy picture in its silver
and gold setting, and with the princess’s old waiting maid he had
clambered on a shelf to reach it and had broken the little lamp, and the
old servant had tried to reassure him about the lamp and about his wife,
and he carried the holy picture and set it at kitty’s head, carefully
tucking it in behind the pillow. but where, when, and why all this had
happened, he could not tell. he did not understand why the old princess
took his hand, and looking compassionately at him, begged him not to
worry himself, and dolly persuaded him to eat something and led him out
of the room, and even the doctor looked seriously and with commiseration
at him and offered him a drop of something.

all he knew and felt was that what was happening was what had happened

n unearthly shriek. the shriek
was so awful that levin did not even jump up, but holding his breath,
gazed in terrified inquiry at the doctor. the doctor put his head on one
side, listened, and smiled approvingly. everything was so extraordinary
that nothing could strike levin as strange. "i suppose it must be so,"
he thought, and still sat where he was. whose scream was this? he jumped
up, ran on tiptoe to the bedroom, edged round lizaveta petrovna and the
princess, and took up his position at kitty’s pillow. the scream had
subsided, but there was some change now. what it was he did not see and
did not comprehend, and he had no wish to see or comprehend. but he saw
it by the face of lizaveta petrovna. lizaveta petrovna’s face was stern
and pale, and still as resolute, though her jaws were twitching, and her
eyes were fixed intently on kitty. kitty’s swollen and agonized face, a
tress of hair clinging to her moist brow, was turned to him and sought
his eyes. her lifted hands asked for

as drawn, she pushed him away.

"oh, this is awful! i’m dying, i’m dying! go away!" she shrieked, and
again he heard that unearthly scream.

levin clutched at his head and ran out of the room.

"it’s nothing, it’s nothing, it’s all right," dolly called after him.

but they might say what they liked, he knew now that all was over. he
stood in the next room, his head leaning against the door post, and
heard shrieks, howls such as he had never heard before, and he knew that
what had been kitty was uttering these shrieks. he had long ago ceased
to wish for the child. by now he loathed this child. he did not even
wish for her life now, all he longed for was the end of this awful
anguish.

"doctor! what is it? what is it? by god!" he said, snatching at the
doctor’s hand as he came up.

"it’s the end," said the doctor. and the doctor’s face was so grave as
he said it that levin took _the end_ as meaning her death.

beside himself, he ran into the bedroom. the first thing he saw was

 the
face of lizaveta petrovna. it was even more frowning and stern. kitty’s
face he did not know. in the place where it had been was something that
was fearful in its strained distortion and in the sounds that came from
it. he fell down with his head on the wooden framework of the bed,
feeling that his heart was bursting. the awful scream never paused, it
became still more awful, and as though it had reached the utmost limit
of terror, suddenly it ceased. levin could not believe his ears, but
there could be no doubt; the scream had ceased and he heard a subdued
sti

gers,
responded to his kiss. and meanwhile, there at the foot of the bed, in
the deft hands of lizaveta petrovna, like a flickering light in a lamp,
lay the life of a human creature, which had never existed before, and
which would now with the same right, with the same importance to itself,
live and create in its own image.

"alive! alive! and a boy too! set your mind at rest!" levin heard
lizaveta petrovna saying, as she slapped the baby’s back with a shaking
hand.

"mamma, is it true?" said kitty’s voice.

the princess’s sobs were all the answers she could make. and in the
midst of the silence there came in unmistakable reply to the mother’s
question, a voice quite unlike the subdued voices speaking in the room.
it was the bold, clamorous, self-assertive squall of the new human
being, who had so incomprehensibly appeared.

if levin had been told before that kitty was dead, and that he had died
with her, and that their children were angels, and that god was standing
before him, he 
 
 ___________________________
 
would have been surprised at nothing. but now, coming
back to the world of reality, he had to make great mental efforts to
take in that she was alive and well, and that the creature squalling so
desperately was his son. kitty was alive, her agony was over. and he was
unutterably happy. that he understood; he was completely happy in it.
but the baby? whence, why, who was he?... he could not get used to the
idea. it seemed to him something extraneous, superfluous, to which he
could not accustom himself.



chapter 16


at ten o’clock the old prince, sergey ivanovitch, and stepan
arkadyevitch were sitting at levin’s. having inquired after kitty, they
had dropped into conversation upon other subjects. levin heard th

wide-open little
hands, as though they were soft springs, and putting them into linen
garments, such pity for the little creature came upon him, and such
terror that she would hurt it, that he held her hand back.

lizaveta petrovna laughed.

"don’t be frightened, don’t be frightened!"

when the baby had been put to rights and transformed into a firm doll,
lizaveta petrovna dandled it as though proud of her handiwork, and stood
a little away so that levin might see his son in all his glory.

kitty looked sideways in the same direction, never taking her eyes off
the baby. "give him to me! give him to me!" she said, and even made as
though she would sit up.

"what are you thinking of, katerina alexandrovna, you mustn’t move like
that! wait a minute. i’ll give him to you. here we’re showing papa what
a fine fellow we are!"

and lizaveta petrovna, with one hand supporting the wobbling head,
lifted up on the other arm the strange, limp, red creature, whose head
was lost in its swaddling

clothes. but it had a nose, too, and slanting
eyes and smacking lips.

"a splendid baby!" said lizaveta petrovna.

levin sighed with mortification. this splendid baby excited in him no
feeling but disgust and compassion. it was not at all the feeling he had
looked forward to.

he turned away while lizaveta petrovna put the baby to the unaccustomed
breast.

suddenly laughter made him look round. the baby had taken the breast.

"come, that’s enough, that’s enough!" said lizaveta petrovna, but kitty
would not let the baby go. he fell asleep in her arms.

"look, now," said kitty, turning the baby so that he could see it. the
aged-looking little face suddenly puckered up still more and the baby
sneezed.

smiling, hardly able to restrain his tears, levin kissed his wife and
went out of the dark room. what he felt towards this little creature was
utterly unlike what he had expected. there was nothing cheerful and
joyous in the feeling; on the contrary, it was a new torture of
apprehension. it

these horses, this carriage—how loathsome i am to myself in this
carriage—all his; but i won’t see them again."

thinking over the words in which she would tell dolly, and mentally
working her heart up to great bitterness, anna went upstairs.

"is there anyone with her?" she asked in the hall.

"katerina alexandrovna levin," answered the footman.

"kitty! kitty, whom vronsky was in love with!" thought anna, "the girl
he thinks of with love. he’s sorry he didn’t marry her. but me he thinks
of with hatred, and is sorry he had anything to do with me."

the sisters were having a consultation about nursing when anna called.
dolly went down alone to see the visitor who had interrupted their
conversation.

"well, so you’ve not gone away yet? i meant to have come to you," she
said; "i had a letter from stiva today."

"we had a telegram too," answ

ered anna, looking round for kitty.

"he writes that he can’t make out quite what alexey alexandrovitch
wants, but he won’t go away without a decisive answer."

"i thought you had someone with you. can i see the letter?"

"yes; kitty," said dolly, embarrassed. "she stayed in the nursery. she
has been very ill."

"so i heard. may i see the letter?"

"i’ll get it directly. but he doesn’t refuse; on the contrary, stiva has
hopes," said dolly, stopping in the doorway.

"i haven’t, and indeed i don’t wish it," said anna.

"what’s this? does kitty consider it degrading to meet me?" thought anna
when she was alone. "perhaps she’s right, too. but it’s not for her, the
girl who was in love with vronsky, it’s not for

her to show me that,

any decent woman. i knew that from the first moment i sacrificed
everything to him. and this is my reward! oh, how i hate him! and what
did i come here for? i’m worse here, more miserable." she heard from the
next room the sisters’ voices in consultation. "and what am i going to
say to dolly now? amuse kitty by the sight of my wretchedness, submit to
her patronizing? no; and besides, dolly wouldn’t understand. and it
would be no good my telling her. it would only be interesting to see
kitty, to show her how i despise everyone and everything, how nothing
matters to me now."

dolly came in with the letter. anna read it and handed it back in
silence.

"i knew all that," she said, "and it doesn’t interest me in the least."

"oh, why so? on the contrary, i have hopes," said dolly, looking

ely at anna. she had never seen her in such a strangely
irritable condition. "when are you going away?" she asked.

anna, half-closing her eyes, looked straight before her and did not
answer.

"why does kitty shrink from me?" she said, looking at the door and
flushing red.

"oh, what nonsense! she’s nursing, and things aren’t going right with
her, and i’ve been advising her.... she’s delighted. she’ll be here in a
minute," said dolly awkwardly, not clever at lying. "yes, here she is."

hearing that anna had called, kitty had wanted not to appear, but dolly
persuaded her. rallying her forces, kitty went in, walked up to her,
blushing, and shook hands.

"i am so glad to see you," she said wi

th a trembling voice.

kitty had been thrown into confusion by the inward conflict between her
antagonism to this bad woman and her desire to be nice to her. but as
soon as she saw anna’s lovely and attractive face, all feeling of
antagonism disappeared.

"i should not have been surprised if you had not cared to meet me. i’m
used to everything. you have been ill? yes, you are changed," said anna.

kitty felt that anna was looking at her with hostile eyes. she ascribed
this hostility to the awkward position in which anna, who had once
patronized her, must feel with her now, and she felt sorry for her.

they talked of kitty’s illness, of the baby, of stiva, but it was
obvious that nothing interested anna.

"i came to say good-bye to you," she said, getting up.

"oh, when are you going?"

but again not answering, anna turned to kitty.

"yes, i am very glad to have seen you," she said with a smi

malicious intent. "where is he?"

"he has gone back to the country," said kitty, blushing.

"remember me to him, be sure you do."

"i’ll be sure to!" kitty said naïvely, looking compassionately into her
eyes.

"so good-bye, dolly." and kissing dolly and shaking hands with kitty,
anna went out hurriedly.

"she’s just the same and just as charming! she’s very lovely!" said
kitty, when she was alone with her sister. "but there’s something
piteous about her. awfully piteous!"

"yes, there’s something unusual about her today," said dolly. "when i
went with her into the hall, i fancied she was almost crying."

anna got into the carriage again in an even worse frame of mind than
when she set out from home. to her previous tortures was added now that

he knew me. well, he knows me as well as anyone in the world knows me. i

looking at two boys stopping an ice cream seller, who took a barrel off
his head and began wiping his perspiring face with a towel. "we all want
what is sweet and nice. if not sweetmeats, then a dirty ice. and kitty’s
the same—if not vronsky, then levin. and she envies me, and hates me.
and we all hate each other. i kitty, kitty me. yes, that’s the truth.
‘_tiutkin, coiffeur._’ _je me fais coiffer par tiutkin...._ i’ll tell
him that when he comes," she thought and smiled. but the same instant
she remembered that she had no one now to tell anything amusing to. "and
there’s nothing amusing, nothing mirthful, really. it’s all hateful.
they’re singing for vespers, and how carefully that merch

and shifted her place in the carriage in the excitement, aroused by the
thought that suddenly struck her. "if i could be anything but a
mistress, passionately caring for nothing but his caresses; but i can’t
and i don’t care to be anything else. and by that desire i rouse
aversion in him, and he rouses fury in me, and it cannot be different.

princess sorokina, that he’s not in love with kitty, that he won’t
desert me! i know all that, but it makes it no better for me. if without
loving me, from _duty_ he’ll be good and kind to me, without what i

and alexey alexandrovitch lets me have seryozha,
and i marry vronsky." thinking of alexey alexandrovitch, she at once
pictured him with extraordinary vividness as though he were alive before
her, with his mild, lifeless, dull eyes, the blue veins in his white
hands, his intonations and the cracking of his fingers, and remembering
the feeling which had existed between them, and which was also called
love, she shuddered with loathing. "well, i’m divorced, and become
vronsky’s wife. well, will kitty cease looking at me as she looked at me
today? no. and will seryozha leave off asking and wondering about my two
husbands? and is there any new feeling i can awaken between vronsky and
me? is there possible, if not happiness, some sort of ease from misery?
no, no!" she answered now without the slightest hesitation. "impossible!

there’s no altering him or me. every attempt has been made, the screw

chapter 6


sergey ivanovitch had not telegraphed to his brother to send to meet
him, as he did not know when he should be able to leave moscow. levin
was not at home when katavasov and sergey ivanovitch in a fly hired at
the station drove up to the steps of the pokrovskoe house, as black as
moors from the dust of the road. kitty, sitting on the balcony with her
father and sister, recognized her brother-in-law, and ran down to meet
him.

"what a shame not to have let us know," she said, giving her hand to
sergey ivanovitch, and putting her forehead up for him to kiss.

"we drove here capitally, and have not put you out," answered sergey
ivanovitch. "i’m so dirty. i’m afraid to touch you. i’ve been so busy, i
didn’t know when i should be able to tear myself away. and so you’re
still as ever enjoying your peacef

 human being when i wash," said
katavasov in his jesting fashion, and he shook hands and smiled, his
teeth flashing white in his black face.

"kostya will be delighted. he has gone to his settlement. it’s time he
should be home."

"busy as ever with his farming. it really is a peaceful backwater," said
katavasov; "while we in town think of nothing but the servian war. well,
how does our friend look at it? he’s sure not to think like other
people."

"oh, i don’t know, like everybody else," kitty answered, a little
embarrassed, looking round at sergey ivanovitch. "i’ll send to fetch
him. papa’s staying with us. he’s only just come home from abroad."

and making arrangements to send for levin and for the guests to wash,
one in his room and the other in what had been dolly’s, and giving
orders for their luncheon, kitty ran out onto the balcony, enjoying the
freedom, and rapidity of movement, of which she had been deprived during
the months of her pregnancy.

"it’s sergey ivanovi

tch and katavasov, a professor," she said.

"oh, that’s a bore in this heat," said the prince.

"no, papa, he’s very nice, and kostya’s very fond of him," kitty said,
with a deprecating smile, noticing the irony on her father’s face.

"oh, i didn’t say anything."

"you go to them, darling," said kitty to her sister, "and entertain
them. they saw stiva at the station; he was quite well. and i must run
to mitya. as ill-luck would have it, i haven’t fed him since tea. he’s
awake now, and sure to be screaming." and feeling a rush of milk, she
hurried to the nursery.

this was not a mere guess; her connection with the child was still so
close, that she could gauge by the flow of her milk his need of food,
and knew for certain he was hungry.

she knew he was crying before she reached the nurse

ry. and he was indeed
crying. she heard him and hastened. but the faster she went, the louder
he screamed. it was a fine healthy scream, hungry and impatient.

"has he been screaming long, nurse, very long?" said kitty hurriedly,
seating herself on a chair, and preparing to give the baby the breast.
"but give me him quickly. oh, nurse, how tiresome you are! there, tie
the cap afterwards, do!"

the baby’s greedy scream was passing into sobs.

"but you can’t manage so, ma’am," said agafea mihalovna, who was almost
always to be found in the nursery. "he must be put straight. a-oo!
a-oo!" she chanted over him, paying no attention to the mother.

the nurse brought the baby to his mother. agafea mihalovna fol

lowed him
with a face dissolving with tenderness.

"he knows me, he knows me. in god’s faith, katerina alexandrovna, ma’am,
he knew me!" agafea mihalovna cried above the baby’s screams.

but kitty did not hear her words. her impatience kept growing, like the
baby’s.

their impatience hindered things for a while. the baby could not get
hold of the breast right, and was furious.

at last, after despairing, breathless screaming, and vain sucking,
things went right, and mother and child felt simultaneously soothed, and
both subsided into calm.

"but poor darling, he’s all in perspiration!" said kitty in a whisper,
touching the baby.

"what makes you think he knows you?" she added, with a

 sidelong glance
at the baby’s eyes, that peered roguishly, as she fancied, from under
his cap, at his rhythmically puffing cheeks, and the little red-palmed
hand he was waving.

"impossible! if he knew anyone, he would have known me," said kitty, in
response to agafea mihalovna’s statement, and she smiled.

she smiled because, though she said he could not know her, in her heart
she was sure that he knew not merely agafea mihalovna, but that he knew
and understood everything, and knew and understood a great deal too that
no one else knew, and that she, his mother, had learned and come to
understand only through him. to agafea mihalovna, to the nurse, to his
grandfather, to his father even, mitya was a living being, requiring
only mate

rial care, but for his mother he had long been a mortal being,
with whom there had been a whole series of spiritual relations already.

"when he wakes up, please god, you shall see for yourself. then when i
do like this, he simply beams on me, the darling! simply beams like a
sunny day!" said agafea mihalovna.

"well, well; then we shall see," whispered kitty. "but now go away, he’s
going to sleep."



chapter 7


agafea mihalovna went out on tiptoe; the nurse let down the blind,
chased a fly out from under the muslin canopy of the crib, and a
bumblebee struggling on the window-frame, and sat down waving a faded
branch of birch over the mother and the baby.

"how hot it is! if god would send a drop of rain," she said.

"yes, yes, sh—sh—sh—" was all kitty answered, rocking a little, and
tenderly squeezing the plump little arm, with rolls of f

at at the wrist,
which mitya still waved feebly as he opened and shut his eyes. that hand
worried kitty; she longed to kiss the little hand, but was afraid to for
fear of waking the baby. at last the little hand ceased waving, and the
eyes closed. only from time to time, as he went on sucking, the baby
raised his long, curly eyelashes and peeped at his mother with wet eyes,
that looked black in the twilight. the nurse had left off fanning, and
was dozing. from above came the peals of the old prince’s voice, and the
chuckle of katavasov.

"they have got into talk without me," thought kitty, "but

, and passed instantly to the consideration of where
it would be more convenient to put katavasov, to sleep alone or to share
sergey ivanovitch’s room. and then an idea suddenly struck her, which
made her shudder and even disturb mitya, who glanced severely at her. "i
do believe the laundress hasn’t sent the washing yet, and all the best
sheets are in use. if i don’t see to it, agafea mihalovna will give
sergey ivanovitch the wrong sheets," and at the very idea of this the
blood rushed to kitty’s face.

"yes, i will arrange it," she decided, and going back to her former
thoughts, she remembered that some spiritual question of importance had
been interrupted, and she began to recall what. "yes, kostya, an
unbeliever," she thought again with a smile.

"well, an unbeliever then! better let him always be one than like madame
stahl, or what i tried to be in those days abroad. no, he won’t ever
sham anything."

and a recent instance of his goodness rose vividly to her mind. a
fortnight

ago a penitent letter had come from stepan arkadyevitch to
dolly. he besought her to save his honor, to sell her estate to pay his
debts. dolly was in despair, she detested her husband, despised him,
pitied him, resolved on a separation, resolved to refuse, but ended by
agreeing to sell part of her property. after that, with an irrepressible
smile of tenderness, kitty recalled her husband’s shamefaced
embarrassment, his repeated awkward efforts to approach the subject, and
how at last, having thought of the one means of helping dolly without
wounding her pride, he had suggested to kitty—what had not occurred to
her before—that she should give up her share of the property.

"he an unbeliever indeed! with his heart, his dread of offending anyone,
even a child! everything for others, nothing for himself. sergey
ivanovitch simply considers it as kostya’s

 chief thing—faith in god, in goodness, as
the one goal of man’s destiny.

under every article of faith of the church could be put the faith in the
service of truth instead of one’s desires. and each doctrine did not
simply leave that faith unshaken, each doctrine seemed essential to
complete that great miracle, continually manifest upon earth, that made
it possible for each man and millions of different sorts of men, wise
men and imbeciles, old men and children—all men, peasants, lvov, kitty,
beggars and kings to understand perfectly the same one thing, and to
build up thereby that life of the soul which alone is worth living, and
which alone is precious to us.

lying on his back, he gazed up now into the high, cloudless sky. "do i
not know that that is infinite space, and that it is not a round arch?
but, however i screw up my eyes and strain my sight, i cannot see it not
round and not bounded, and in spite of my knowing about infinite space,

beside him, and remembered that he was expecting his brother, thought
that his wife was most likely uneasy at his long absence, and tried to
guess who was the visitor who had come with his brother. and his brother
and his wife and the unknown guest seemed to him now quite different
from before. he fancied that now his relations with all men would be
different.

"with my brother there will be none of that aloofness there always used
to be between us, there will be no disputes; with kitty there shall
never be quarrels; with the visitor, whoever he may be, i will be
friendly and nice; with the servants, with ivan, it will all be
different."

pulling the stiff rein and holding in the good horse that snorted with
impatience and seemed begging to be let go, levin looked round at ivan
sitting beside him, not knowing what to do with his unoccupied hand,
continually pressing down his shirt as it puffed out, and he tried to
find something to start a conversation about with him. he would

it, knowing that he could do nothing better than utter this senseless
prayer.

running up to the place where they usually went, he did not find them
there.

they were at the other end of the copse under an old lime-tree; they
were calling him. two figures in dark dresses (they had been light
summer dresses when they started out) were standing bending over
something. it was kitty with the nurse. the rain was already ceasing,
and it was beginning to get light when levin reached them. the nurse was
not wet on the lower part of her dress, but kitty was drenched through,
and her soaked clothes clung to her. though the rain was over, they
still stood in the same position in which they had been standing when
the storm broke. both stood bending over a perambulator with a green
umbrella.

"alive? unhurt? thank god!" he said, splashing with his soaked boots
through the standing

water and running up to them.

kitty’s rosy wet face was turned towards him, and she smiled timidly
under her shapeless sopped hat.

"aren’t you ashamed of yourself? i can’t think how you can be so
reckless!" he said angrily to his wife.

"it wasn’t my fault, really. we were just meaning to go, when he made
such a to-do that we had to change him. we were just..." kitty began
defending herself.

mitya was unharmed, dry, and still fast asleep.

"well, thank god! i don’t know what i’m saying!"

they gathered up the baby’s wet belongings; the nurse picked up the baby
and carried it. levin walked beside his wife, and, penitent for having
been angry, he squeezed her hand when the nurse was not looking.



chapter 18


during the whole of that day, in the extremely different conversations
in which he took part, only as it were with the top layer of his mind,
i
 
 ___________________________
 
t katavasov amused the ladies by his original jokes, which always
pleased people on their first acquaintance with him. then sergey
ivanovitch induced him to tell them about the very interesting
observations he had made on the habits and characteristics of common
houseflies, and their life. sergey ivanovitch, too, was in good spirits,
and at tea his brother drew him on to explain his views of the future of
the eastern question, and he spoke so simply and so well, that everyone
listened eagerly.

kitty was the only one who did not hear it all—she was summoned to give
mitya his bath.

a few minutes after kitty had left the room she sent for levin to come
to the nursery.

leaving his tea, and regretfully interrupting the interesting
conversation, and at the same time uneasily wondering why he had been
sent for, as this only happened on important occasions, levin went to
the nursery.

although he had been much interested by sergey ivanovitch’s views of the
new epoch in history that would be 
 
 ___________________________
 
created by the emancipation of forty
millions of men of slavonic race acting with russia, a conception quite
new to him, and although he was disturbed by uneasy wonder at being sent
for by kitty, as soon as he came out of the drawing room and was alone,
his mind reverted at once to the thoughts of the morning. and all the
theories of the significance of the slav element in the history of the
world seemed to him so trivial compared with what was passing in his own
soul, that he instantly forgot it all and dropped back into the same
frame of mind that he had been in that morning.

he did not, as he had done at other times, recall the whole train of
thought—that he did not need. he fell

clear!"

just as he was going into the nursery he remembered what it was he had
shirked facing. it was that if the chief proof of the divinity was his
revelation of what is right, how is it this revelation is confined to
the christian church alone? what relation to this revelation have the
beliefs of the buddhists, mohammedans, who preached and did good too?

it seemed to him that he had an answer to this question; but he had not
time to formulate it to himself before he went into the nursery.

kitty was standing with her sleeves tucked up over the baby in the bath.
hearing her husband’s footstep, she turned towards him, summoning him to
her with her smile. with one hand she was supporting the fat baby that
lay floating and sprawling on its back, while with the other she
squeezed the sponge over him.

"come, look, look!" she said, when her husband came up to her. "agafea
mihalovna’s right. he knows us!"

mitya had on that day given unmistakable, incontestable signs of
recognizing all hi

s friends.

as soon as levin approached the bath, the experiment was tried, and it
was completely successful. the cook, sent for with this object, bent
over the baby. he frowned and shook his head disapprovingly. kitty bent
down to him, he gave her a beaming smile, propped his little hands on
the sponge and chirruped, making such a queer little contented sound
with his lips, that kitty and the nurse were not alone in their
admiration. levin, too, was surprised and delighted.

the baby was taken out of the bath, drenched with water, wrapped in
towels, dried, and after a piercing scream, handed to his mother.

"well, i am glad you are beginning to love him," said kitty to her
husband, when she had settled herself comfortably in her usual place,
with the baby at her breast. "i am so glad! it had begun to distress me.
you said you had no feeling for him."

"no; did i say that? i

?"

"not disappointed in him, but in my own feeling; i had expected more. i
had expected a rush of new delightful emotion to come as a surprise. and
then instead of that—disgust, pity..."

she listened attentively, looking at him over the baby, while she put
back on her slender fingers the rings she had taken off while giving
mitya his bath.

"and most of all, at there being far more apprehension and pity than
pleasure. today, after that fright during the storm, i understand how i
love him."

kitty’s smile was radiant.

"were you very much frightened?" she said. "so was i too, but i feel it
more now that it’s over. i’m going to look at the oak. how nice
katavasov is! and what a happy day we’ve had altogether. and you’re so
nice with sergey ivanovitch, when you care to be.... well, go back to
them. it’s always so hot and steamy here after the bath."



chapter 19


going out of the nursery and being again alone, levin went back at once
to the thought, in which there was somethi

observations of the seen heavens, in relation to a single meridian and a
single horizon, so would my conclusions be vain and uncertain if not
founded on that conception of right, which has been and will be always
alike for all men, which has been revealed to me as a christian, and
which can always be trusted in my soul. the question of other religions
and their relations to divinity i have no right to decide, and no
possibility of deciding."

"oh, you haven’t gone in then?" he heard kitty’s voice all at once, as
she came by the same way to the drawing-room.

"what is it? you’re not worried about anything?" she said, looking
intently at his face in the starlight.

but she could not have seen his face if a flash of lightning had not
hidden the stars and revealed it. in that flash she saw his face
distinctly, and seeing him calm and happy, she smiled at him.

"she understands," he thought; "she knows what i’m thinking about. shall
i tell her or not? yes, i’ll tell her." but
