three tiers of racks: ground floor level, first gallery, second gallery.

demijohns from a moving staircase.

outside, in the dust and among the garbage (there were four dogs 
now), bernard and john were walking slowly up and down. 

"so hard for me to realize," bernard was saying, "to reconstruct. as 
though we were living on different planets, in different centuries. a 
mother, and all this dirt, and gods, and old age, and disease ..." he 
shook his head. "it's almost inconceivable. i shall never understand, 
unless you explain." 

"explain what?" 

"this." he indicated the pueblo. "that." and it was the little house out- 
side the village. "everything. all your life." 

"but what is the

it was very hot. they had eaten a lot of tortillas and sweet corn. linda 
said, "come and lie down, baby." they lay down together in the big 



bed. "sing," and linda sang. sang "streptocock-gee to banbury-t" and 
"bye baby banting, soon you'll need decanting." her voice got fainter 
and fainter ... 

there was a loud noise, and he woke with a start. a man was saying 
something to linda, and linda was laughing. she had pulled the blan-

two black ropes, and round his arm was a lovely silver bracelet with 
blue stones in it. he liked the bracelet; but all the same, he was fright- 
ened; he hid his face against linda's body. linda put her hand on him 
and he felt safer. in those other words he did not understand so well, 
she said to the man, "not with john here." the man looked at him, 
then again at linda, and said a few words in a soft voice. linda said, 
"no." but the man bent over the bed towards him and his face was 
huge, terrible; the black ropes of hair touched the blanket. "no," linda 
said again, and he felt her hand squeezing him more tightly. "no, no!" 
but the man took hold of one of his arms, and it hurt. he screamed. 
the man put up his other hand and lifted him up. linda was still hold-

else he asked about. linda never seemed to know. the old men of the 
pueblo had much more definite answers. 

"the seed of men and all creatures, the seed of the sun and the seed 
of earth and the seed of the sky-awonawilona made them all out of 
the fog of increase. now the world has four wombs; and he laid the 
seeds in the lowest of the four wombs. and gradually the seeds began 
to grow ..." 

one day (john calculated later that it must have been soon after his 
twelfth birthday) he came home and found a book that he had never 
seen before lying on the floor in the bedroom. it was a thick book and 
looked very old. the binding had been eaten by mice; some of its 
pages were loose and crumpled. he picked it up, looked at the title- 
page: the book was called the complete works of william shake- 
speare. 

linda was lying on the bed, sipping that horrible stinking mescal out of 
a cup. "pope brought

and holding up a feathered prayer stick, made a long prayer, then 
threw the stick after the corn meal. 

"it is finished," said old mitsima in a loud voice. "they are married." 
"well," said linda, as they turned away, "all i can say is, it does seem 
a lot of fuss to make about so little. in civilized countries, when a boy 
wants to have a girl, he just ... but where are you going, john?"

he had discovered time and death and god. 
"alone, always alone," the young man was saying. 
the words awoke a plaintive echo in bernard's mind. alone, alone ... 
"so am i," he said, on a gush of confidingness. "terribly alone." 
"are you?" john looked surprised. "i thought that in the other place ... 
i mean, linda always said that nobody was ever alone there." 
bernard blushed uncomfortably. "you see," he said, mumbling and with 
averted eyes, "i'm rather different from most people, i suppose. if one 
happens to be decanted different ..." 

"yes, that's just it." the young man nodded. "if one's different, one's

then-suddenly interrupted himself; the blood had left his cheeks; he 
was as pale as paper. 
"are you married to her?" he asked. 
"am i what?" 

"married. you know-for ever. they say 'for ever' in the indian words; it 
can't be broken." 



"ford, no!" bernard couldn't help laughing. 

john also laughed, but for another reason-laughed for pure joy. 

"o brave new world," he repeated. "o brave new world that has such 

people in it. let's start at once." 

"you have a most peculiar way of talking sometimes," said bernard, 

staring at the young man in perplexed astonishment. "and, anyhow, 

hadn't you better wait till you actually see the new world?"

her, horrified. "yes, a baby-and i was its mother." she flung the ob- 
scenity like a challenge into the outraged silence; then, suddenly 
breaking away from him, ashamed, ashamed, covered her face with 
her hands, sobbing. "it wasn't my fault, tomakin. because i always did 
my drill, didn't i? didn't i? always ... i don't know how ... if you knew 
how awful, tomakin ... but he was a comfort to me, all the same." 
turning towards the door, "john!" she called. "john!" 

he came in at once, paused for a moment just inside the door, looked 
round, then soft on his moccasined feet strode quickly across the 
room, fell on his knees in front of the director, and said in a clear 
voice: "my father!" 

the word (for "father" was not so much obscene as-with its connota-

obliquity of child-bearing-merely gross, a scatological rather than a 
pornographic impropriety); the comicall

wanted. she took as much as twenty grammes a day. 

"which will finish her off in a month or two," the doctor confided to 
bernard. "one day the respiratory centre will be paralyzed. no more 
breathing. finished. and a good thing too. if we could rejuvenate, of 
course it would be different. but we can't." 

surprisingly, as every one thought (for on soma-holiday linda was 
most conveniently out of the way), john raised objections. 

"but aren't you shortening her life by giving her so much?" 

"in one sense, yes," dr. shaw admitted. "but in another we're actually 
lengthening it." the young man stared, uncomprehending. "soma may 
make you lose a few years in time," the doctor went on. "but think of 
the enormous, immeasurable durations it can give you out of time. 
every soma-holiday is a bit of what our ancestors used to call eter- 
nity." 

john began to understand. "eternity was in our lips and eyes

murmured. 

"eh?" 

"nothing." 

"of course," dr. shaw went on, "you can't allow people to go popping 
off into eternity if they've got any serious work to do. but as she 
hasn't got any serious work ..." 

"all the same," john persisted, "i don't believe it's right." 

the doctor shrugged his shoulders. "well, of course, if you prefer to 
have her screaming mad all the time ..." 

in the end john was forced to give in. linda got her soma. thencefor- 
ward she remained in her little room on the thirty-seventh floor of 
bernard's apartment house, in bed, with the radio and television al- 



ways on, and the patchouli tap just dripping, and the soma tablets 
within reach of her hand-there she remained; and yet wasn't there at 
all, was all the time away, infinitely far away, on holiday; on holiday in

some indescribably delicious all-singing feely; where the dripping 
patchouli was more than scent-was the sun, was a million saxophones, 
was pope making love, only much more so, incomparably more, and 
without end. 

"no, we can't rejuvenate. but i'm very glad," dr. shaw had concluded, 
"to have had this opportunity to see an example of senility in a human 
being. thank you so much for calling me in." he shook bernard warmly 
by the hand. 

it was john, then, they were all after. and as it was only through ber- 
nard, his accredited guardian, that john could be seen, bernard now 
found himself, for the first time in his life, treated not merely normally, 
but as a person of outstanding importance. there was no more talk of 
the alcohol in his blood-surrogate, no gibes at his personal appear- 
ance. henry foster went out of his way to be friendly; benito hoover

the bombay green rocket dropped out of the sky. the passengers 
alighted. eight identical dravidian twins in khaki looked out of the 
eight portholes of the cabin-the stewards. 

"twelve hundred and fifty kilometres an hour," said the station master 
impressively. "what do you think of that, mr. savage?" 

john thought it very nice. "still," he said, "ariel could put a girdle 
round the earth in forty minutes." 

"the savage," wrote bernard in his report to mustapha mond, "shows 
surprisingly little astonishment at, or awe of, civilized inventions. this 
is partly due, no doubt, to the fact that he has heard them talked 
about by the woman linda, his m ."

see the word written out at full length?")

ing his thumb towards the savage, "he's curious, you know," bernard 
added. "quaint."

said thank you; would be delighted to come to one of his parties. the 
provost opened a door. 



five minutes in that alpha double plus classroom left john a trifle be- 
wildered. 

"what is elementary relativity?" he whispered to bernard. bernard 
tried to explain, then thought better of it and suggested that they 
should go to some other classroom. 

from behind a door in the corridor leading to the beta-minus geogra- 
phy room, a ringing soprano voice called, "one, two, three, four," and 
then, with a weary impatience, "as you were."

ditions, or poverty of natural resources, has not been worth the ex-

before the eagle image of pookong. the young et

pushed over a little cardboard pillbox. the long caterpillar of men and 
women moved slowly forward. 

"what's in those" (remembering the merchant of venice) "those cas- 
kets?" the savage enquired when bernard had rejoined him. 

"the day's soma ration," bernard answered rather indistinctly; for he 
was masticating a piece of benito hoover's chewing-gum. "they get it 
after their work's over. four half-gramme tablets. six on saturdays." 

he took john's arm affectionately and they walked back towards the

to transfer from lenina herself to the surrounding circumstances the 
blame for any past or possible future lapse from perfection. 
"things like what, john?" 
"like this horrible film." 

"horrible?" lenina was genuinely astonished. "but i thought it was 
lovely." 

"it was base," he said indignantly, "it was ignoble." 
she shook her head. "i don't know what you mean." why was he so 
queer? why did he go out of his way to spoil things? 
in the taxicopter he hardly even looked at her. bound by strong vows 
that had never been pronounced, obedient to laws that had long since 
ceased to run, he sat averted and in silence. sometimes, as though a

at her. 

"good-night," said a strangled voice behind her. lenina wheeled round. 
he was standing in the doorway of the cab, his eyes fixed, staring; had 
evidently been staring all this time while she was powdering her nose, 
waiting-but what for? or hesitating, trying to make up his mind, and 
all the time thinking, thinking-she could not imagine what extraordi- 
nary thoughts. "good-night, lenina," he repeated, and made a strange 
grimacing attempt to smile. 

"but, john ... i thought you were ... i mean, aren't you? ..." 
he shut the door and bent forward to say something to the driver. the 
cab shot up into the air. 

looking down through the window in the floor, the savage could see 
lenina's upturned face, pale in the bluish light of the lamps. the 
mouth was open, she was calling. her foreshortened figure rushed 



away from him; the diminishing square of the roof seemed to be falling 
through the darkness.

bernard had to shout through the locked door; the savage would not 
open. 

"but everybody's there, waiting for you." 

"let them wait," came back the muffled voice through the door. 

"but you know quite well, john" (how difficult it is to sound persuasive 
at the top of one's voice!) "i asked them on purpose to meet you." 

"you ought to have asked me first whether i wanted to meet them." 

"but you always came before, john." 

"that's precisely why i don't want to come again." 

"just to please me," bernard bellowingly wheedled. "won't you come 
to please me?" 

"no." 

"do you seriously mean it?" 

"yes." 



despairingly, "but what shall i do?" bernard wailed. 

"go to hell!" bawled the exasperated vo

it was at this moment that bernard had made his announcement; the 
savage wasn't coming to the party. 

lenina suddenly felt all the sensations normally experienced at the be- 
ginning of a violent passion surrogate treatment-a sense of dreadful 
emptiness, a breathless apprehension, a nausea. her heart seemed to 
stop beating. 

"perhaps it's because he doesn't like me," she said to herself. and at 
once this possibility became an established certainty: john had refused 
to come because he didn't like her. he didn't like her. ... 

"it really is a bit too thick," the head mistress of eton was saying to 
the director of crematoria and phosphorus reclamation. "when i think 
that i actually ..." 

"yes," came the voice of fanny crowne, "it's absolutely true about the 
alcohol. some one i know knew some one who was working in the 
embryo store at the time. she said to my friend, and my friend said to

sciousness, some enlargement of knowledge. which was, the control- 
ler reflected, quite possibly true. but not, in the present circumstance, 
admissible. he picked up his pen again, and under the words "not to 
be published" drew a second line, thicker and blacker than the first; 
then sighed, "what fun it would be," he thought, "if one didn't have to 
think about happiness!" 

with closed eyes, his face shining with rapture, john was softly de- 
claiming to vacancy: 

"oh! she doth teach the torches to burn bright. 

it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night, 
like a rich jewel in an ethiop's ear; 
beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear ..." 
the golden t lay shining on lenina's bosom. sportively, the arch- 
community-songster caught hold of it, sportively he pulled, pulled. "i 
think," said lenina suddenly, breaking a long silence, "i'd better take a 
couple of grammes of soma."

"oh, for ford's sake," said lenina, breaking her stubborn silence, "shut 
up!" and she turned back to her neglected embryos. 

a v.p.s. treatment indeed! she would have laughed, if she hadn't been 
on the point of crying. as though she hadn't got enough v. p. of her 
own! she sighed profoundly as she refilled her syringe. "john," she 
murmured to herself, "john ..." then "my ford," she wondered, "have i 
given this one its sleeping sickness injection, or haven't i?" she simply 
couldn't remember. in the end, she decided not to run the risk of let- 
ting it have a second dose, and moved down the line to the next bot- 
tle.

confidences a moment longer), jumped up and ran to the door. 

"i had a premonition it was you, helmholtz," he shouted as he opened. 

on the threshold, in a white acetate-satin sailor suit, and with a round 
white cap rakishly tilted over her left ear, stood lenina. 



"oh!" said the savage, as though some one had struck him a heavy 
blow. 

half a gramme had been enough to make lenina forget her fears and 
her embarrassments. "hullo, john," she said, smiling, and walked past 
him into the room. automatically he closed the door and followed her. 
lenina sat down. there was a long silence. 

"you don't seem very glad to see me, john," she said at last. 

"not glad?" the savage looked at her reproachfully; then suddenly fell 
on his knees before her and, taking lenina's hand, reverently kissed it. 
"not glad? oh, if you only knew," he whispered and, venturing to raise 
his eyes to her face, "admired lenina," he went on, "indeed the

"and what on earth vacuum cleaners have got to do with lions ..." 

"to show how much ..." 

"or lions with being glad to see me ..." she was getting more and more 
exasperated. 

"how much i love you, lenina," he brought out almost desperately. 

an emblem of the inner tide of startled elation, the blood rushed up 
into lenina's cheeks. "do you mean it, john?" 

"but i hadn't meant to say so," cried the savage, clasping his hands in 
a kind of agony. "not until ... listen, lenina; in malpais people get mar- 
ried." 

"get what?" the irritation had begun to creep back into her voice. 
what was he talking about now? 

"for always. they make a promise to live together for always." 

"what a horrible idea!" lenina was genuinely shocked.

she jumped up and, as though afraid that he might run away from her 
physically, as well as with his mind, caught him by the wrist. "answer 
me this question: do you really like me, or don't you?" 

there was a moment's silence; then, in a very low voice, "i love you 
more than anything in the world," he said.

the savage caught her by the wrists, tore her hands from his shoul-

"ow, you're hurting me, you're ... oh!" she was suddenly silent. terror

face-no, not his face, a ferocious stranger's, pale, distorted, twitching 
with some insane, inexplicable fury. aghast, "but what is it, john?" she 
whispered. he did not answer, but only stared into her face with those 
mad eyes. the hands that held her wrists were trembling. he breathed 
deeply and irregularly. faint almost to imperceptibility, but appalling, 
she suddenly heard the grinding of his teeth. "what is it?" she almost 
screamed. 

and as though awakened by her cry he caught her by the shoulders 
and shook her. "whore!" he shouted "whore! impudent strumpet!" 

"oh, don't, do-on't," she protested in a voice made grotesque

lous by his shaking. 

"whore!" 

"plea-ease." 

"damned whore!" 

"a gra-amme is be-etter ..." she began. 

the savage pushed her away with such force that she staggered and 
fell. "go," he shouted, standing over her menacingly, "get out of my 
sight or i'll kill you." he clenched his fists. 

lenina raised her arm to cover her face. "no, please don't, john ..." 

"hurry up. quick!" 

one arm still raised, and following his every movement with a terrified 
eye, she scrambled to her feet and still crouching, still covering her 
head, made a dash for the bathroom. 



the noise of that prodigious slap by which her departure was acceler- 
ated was like a pistol shot. 

"ow!" lenina bounded forward. 

safely locked into the bathroom, she had leisure to take stock of her 
injuries. standing with her back to the mirror, she twisted her head.

deningly they rumbled in his ears. "the fitchew nor the soiled horse 
goes to't with a more riotous appetite. down from the waist they are 
centaurs, though women all above. but to the girdle do the gods in- 
herit. beneath is all the fiend's. there's hell, there's darkness, there is 
the sulphurous pit, burning scalding, stench, consumption; fie, fie, fie, 
pain, pain! give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my 
imagination." 

"john!" ventured a small ingratiating voice from the bathroom. "john!" 

"o thou weed, who are so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet that the 
sense aches at thee. was this most goodly book made to write 'whore' 
upon? heaven stops the nose at it ..." 

but her perfume still hung about him, his jacket was white with the 
powder that had scented her velvety body. "impudent strumpet, im- 
pudent strumpet, impudent strumpet." the inexorable rhythm beat it- 
self out. "impudent ..." 

"john, do you think

i might have my clothes?" 

he picked up the bell-bottomed trousers, the blouse, the zippicami- 
knicks. 

"open!" he ordered, kicking the door. 

"no, i won't." the voice was frightened and defiant. 



"well, how do you expect me to give them to you?" 

"push them through the ventilator over the door." 

he did what she suggested and returned to his uneasy pacing of the 
room. "impudent strumpet, impudent strumpet. the devil luxury with 
his fat rump and potato finger ..." 

"john." 

he would not answer. "fat rump and potato finger." 

"john." 

"what is it?" he asked gruffly. 

"i wonder if you'd mind giving me my malthusian belt." 
lenina sat, listening to the footsteps in the other room, wondering, as 
she listened, how long he was likely to go tramping up and down like 
that; whether she would have to wait until he left the flat; or if it 
would be safe, after allowing his madness a reasonable time to sub- 
side, to open the bathroom door and make a dash for it.

 the 
matter with her? why is she so fat?" 

they had never seen a face like hers before-had never seen a face 
that was not youthful and taut-skinned, a body that had ceased to be 
slim and upright. all these moribund sexagenarians had the appear- 
ance of childish girls. at forty-four, linda seemed, by contrast, a mon- 
ster of flaccid and distorted senility. 

"isn't she awful?" came the whispered comments. "look at her teeth!" 
suddenly from under the bed a pug-faced twin popped up between 
john's chair and the wall, and began peering into linda's sleeping face. 
"i say ..." he began; but the sentence ended prematurely in a squeal. 
the savage had seized him by the collar, lifted him clear over the chair 
and, with a smart box on the ears, sent him howling away. 
his yells brought the head nurse hurrying to the rescue. 
"what have you been doing to him?" she demanded fiercely. "i won't 
have you striking the children." 

"well then, keep them away from this bed." the savage's voice was

nence of that which made them so fearful. "don't you know me, 
linda?" 

he felt the faint answering pressure of her hand. the tears started into 
his eyes. he bent over her and kissed her. 

her lips moved. "pope!" she whispered again, and it was as though he 
had had a pailful of ordure thrown in his face. 



anger suddenly boiled up in him. balked for the second time, the pas- 
sion of his grief had found another outlet, was transformed into a pas- 
sion of agonized rage. 

"but i'm john!" he shouted. "i'm john!" and in his furious misery he 
actually caught her by the shoulder and shook her. 
linda's eyes fluttered open; she saw him, knew him-"john!"-but situ- 
ated the real face, the real and violent hands, in an imaginary world- 
among the inward and private equivalents of patchouli and the super- 
wurlitzer, among the transfigured memories and the strangely trans- 
posed sensations that constituted the universe of her dream. she 
knew him for john, her son, but fancied him

 he said. 

the savage looked at him. he had been prepared to lie, to bluster, to 
remain sullenly unresponsive; but, reassured by the good-humoured 
intelligence of the controller's face, he decided to tell the truth, 
straightforwardly. "no." he shook his head. 

bernard started and looked horrified. what would the controller think? 
to be labelled as the friend of a man who said that he didn't like civili- 
zation-said it openly and, of all people, to the controller-it was terri- 
ble. "but, john," he began. a look from mustapha mond reduced him 
to an abject silence. 

"of course," the savage went on to admit, "there are some very nice 
things. all that music in the air, for instance ..." 

"sometimes a thousand twangling instruments will hum about my ears 
and sometimes voices." 

the savage's face lit up with a sudden pleasure. "have you read it 
too?" he asked. "i thought nobody knew about that book here, in eng- 
land." 

"almost nobody. i'm one of the very few. it's prohibited, yo

to be lousy; the right to live in constant apprehension of what may 
happen to-morrow; the right to catch typhoid; the right to be tortured 
by unspeakable pains of every kind." there was a long silence. 
"i claim them all," said the savage at last. 
mustapha mond shrugged his shoulders. "you're welcome," he said. 



chapter eighteen 

the door was ajar; they entered. 

"john!" 

from the bathroom came an unpleasant and characteristic sound. 

"is there anything the matter?" helmholtz called. 

there was no answer. the unpleasant sound was repeated, twice; 
there was silence. then, with a click the bathroom door opened and, 
very pale, the savage emerged. 

"i say," helmholtz exclaimed solicitously, "you do look ill, john!" 

"did you eat something that didn't agree with you?" asked bernard. 

the savage nodded. "i ate civilization." 

"what?" 

"it poisoned me; i w

 purpose?" asked bernard. 

"that's how the indians always purify themselves." he sat down and, 
sighing, passed his hand across his forehead. "i shall rest for a few 
minutes," he said. "i'm rather tired." 

"well, i'm not surprised," said helmholtz. after a silence, "we've come 
to say good-bye," he went on in another tone. "we're off to-morrow 
morning." 

"yes, we're off to-morrow," said bernard on whose face the savage 
remarked a new expression of determined resignation. "and by the 
way, john," he continued, leaning forward in his chair and laying a 
hand on the savage's knee, "i want to say how sorry i am about eve- 
rything that happened yesterday." he blushed. "how ashamed," he 
went on, in spite of the unsteadiness of his voice, "how really ..." 

the savage cut him short and, taking his hand, affectionately pressed 
it. 

"helmholtz was wonderful to me," bernard resumed, after a little 
pause. "if it hadn't been for him, i should ..." 

"now, now," helmholtz protested.

 from the charing-t tower; but the hills of 
malpais were hardly more deserted than this surrey heath. the crowds 
that daily left london, left it only to play electro-magnetic golf or ten- 
nis. puttenham possessed no links; the nearest riemann-surfaces 
were at guildford. flowers and a landscape were the only attractions 
here. and so, as there was no good reason for coming, nobody came. 
during the first days the savage lived alone and undisturbed. 

of the money which, on his first arrival, john had received for his per- 
sonal expenses, most had been spent on his equipment. before leaving 
london he had bought four viscose-woollen blankets, rope and string, 
nails, glue, a few tools, matches (though he intended in due course to 
make a fire drill), some pots and pans, two dozen packets of seeds, 
and ten kilogrammes of wheat flour. "no, not synthetic starch and 
cotton-waste flour-substitute," he had insisted. "even though it is 
more nourishing." but when it came to pan-glandular bis

mopped his face. when they had put in the feely effects at 
the studio, it would be a wonderful film. almost as good, thought dar- 
win bonaparte, as the sperm whale's love-life-and that, by ford, was 
saying a good deal! 

twelve days later the savage of surrey had been released and could 
be seen, heard and felt in every first-class feely-palace in western 
europe. 



the effect of darwin bonaparte's film was immediate and enormous. 
on the afternoon which followed the evening of its release john's rustic 
solitude was suddenly broken by the arrival overhead of a great swarm 
of helicopters. 

he was digging in his garden-digging, too, in his own mind, laboriously 
turning up the substance of his thought. death-and he drove in his 
spade once, and again, and yet again. and all our yesterdays have 
lighted fools the way to dusty death. a convincing thunder rumbled 
through the words. he lifted another spadeful of earth. why had linda 
died? why had she been allowed to become gradually le
