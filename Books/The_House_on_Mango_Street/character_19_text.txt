on tuesdays 

on tuesdays rafaela's husband comes home late be­

cause that's the night he plays dominoes. and then rafaela, 
who  is  still  young  but  getting  old  from  leaning  out  the 
window so much, gets locked indoors because her husband

is  music  from  the  bar,  and  rafaela  wishes  she  could  go 
there and dance before she gets old.

watching until she says:  kids, if i give you a dollar will you
