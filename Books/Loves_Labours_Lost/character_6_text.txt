      nor shines the silver moon one half so bright

      thou shin'st in every tear that i do weep;
      no drop but as a coach doth carry thee;

    ah, good my liege, i pray thee pardon me.
    good heart, what grace hast thou thus to reprove
    these worms for loving, that art most in love?
    your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears
    there is no certain princess that appears;
    you'll not be perjur'd; 'tis a hateful thing;
    tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting.
    but are you not ashamed? nay, are you not,
    all three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?
    you found his mote; the king your mote did see;
    but i a beam do find in each of three.

    no, no, my lord, your grace is perjur'd much,
    full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this,
    if for my love, as there is no such cause,
    you will do aught- this shall you do for me:
    your oath i will not trust; but go with speed
    to some forlorn and naked hermitage,
    remote from all the pleasures of the world;
    there stay until the twelve celestial signs
    have brought about the annual reckoning.
    if this austere insociable life
    change not your offer made in heat of blood,
