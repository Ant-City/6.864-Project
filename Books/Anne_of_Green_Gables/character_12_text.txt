and making eyes at prissy andrews. prissy is grown up, you know. sheâ€™s
sixteen and sheâ€™s studying for the entrance examination into queenâ€™s
academy at charlottetown next year. tillie boulter says the master is
_dead gone_ on her. sheâ€™s got a beautiful complexion and curly brown hair
and she does it up so elegantly. she sits in the long seat at the back
and he sits there, too, most of the time--to explain her lessons, he
says. but ruby gillis says she saw him writing something on her slate
and when prissy read it she blushed as red as a beet and giggled; and
ruby gillis says she doesnâ€™t believe it had anything to do with the
lesson.â€

â€œanne shirley, donâ€™t let me hear you talking about your teacher in that
way again,â€ said marilla sharply. â€œyou donâ€™t go to school to criticize
the master. i guess he can teach _you_ something, and itâ€™s your business
to learn. and i want you to understand right off that you are not to

when mr. phillips was in the back of the room hearing prissy andrewsâ€™s
latin, diana whispered to anne, â€œthatâ€™s gilbert blythe sitting right
across the aisle from you, anne. just look at him and see if you donâ€™t
think heâ€™s handsome.â€

anne looked accordingly. she had a good chance to do so, for the said
gilbert blythe was absorbed in stealthily pinning the long yellow braid
of ruby gillis, who sat in front of him, to the back of her seat. he
was a tall boy, with curly brown hair, roguish hazel eyes, and a mouth
twisted into a teasing smile. presently ruby gillis started up to take
a sum to the master; she fell back into her seat with a little shriek,
believing that her hair was pulled out by the roots. everybody looked at
her and mr. phillips glared so sternly that ruby began to cry. gilbert
had whisked the pin out of sight and was studying his history with the
soberest face in

 queried mr. phillips sternly.

â€œyes, sir,â€ said anne slowly â€œbut i didnâ€™t suppose you really meant it.â€

â€œi assure you i didâ€--still with the sarcastic inflection which all the
children, and anne especially, hated. it flicked on the raw. â€œobey me at
once.â€

for a moment anne looked as if she meant to disobey. then, realizing
that there was no help for it, she rose haughtily, stepped across the
aisle, sat down beside gilbert blythe, and buried her face in her arms
on the desk. ruby gillis, who got a glimpse of it as it went down,
told the others going home from school that sheâ€™d â€œacksually never seen
anything like it--it was so white, with awful little red spots in it.â€

to anne, this was as the end of all things. it was bad enough to be
singled out for punishment from among a dozen equally guilty ones; it
was worse still to be sent to sit with a boy, but that that boy should
be gilbert blythe was heaping insult on injury to a degree utterly
unbearable. anne felt that she

with fruit, proved so delightful that the little girls spent most of the
afternoon in it, sitting in a grassy corner where the frost had spared
the green and the mellow autumn sunshine lingered warmly, eating apples
and talking as hard as they could. diana had much to tell anne of what
went on in school. she had to sit with gertie pye and she hated
it; gertie squeaked her pencil all the time and it just made
her--dianaâ€™s--blood run cold; ruby gillis had charmed all her warts
away, trueâ€™s you live, with a magic pebble that old mary joe from the
creek gave her. you had to rub the warts with the pebble and then throw
it away over your left shoulder at the time of the new moon and the
warts would all go. charlie sloaneâ€™s name was written up with em whiteâ€™s
on the porch wall and em white was _awful mad_ about it; sam boulter had

anne was welcomed back to school with open arms. her imagination had
been sorely missed in games, her voice in the singing and her dramatic
ability in the perusal aloud of books at dinner hour. ruby gillis
smuggled three blue plums over to her during testament reading; ella may
macpherson gave her an enormous yellow pansy cut from the covers of a
floral catalogue--a species of desk decoration much prized in avonlea
school. sophia sloane offered to teach her a perfectly elegant new
pattern of knit lace, so nice for trimming aprons. katie boulter gave
her a perfume bottle to keep slate water in, and julia bell copied
carefully on a piece of pale pink paper scalloped on the edges the

matthewâ€™s religion.

â€œthen iâ€™m conservative too,â€ said anne decidedly. â€œiâ€™m glad because

is a grit too because prissy andrewsâ€™s father is one, and ruby gillis
says that when a man is courting he always has to agree with the girlâ€™s
mother in religion and her father in politics. is that true, matthew?â€

â€œwell now, i dunno,â€ said matthew.

never thought of such a thing in his whole existence.

very proper question to ask because it hadnâ€™t any connection with the

the silly things that were done in avonlea that summer because the doers
thereof were â€œdaredâ€ to do them would fill a book by themselves.

first of all carrie sloane dared ruby gillis to climb to a certain point
in the huge old willow tree before the front door; which ruby gillis,
albeit in mortal dread of the fat green caterpillars with which said
tree was infested and with the fear of her mother before her eyes if she
should tear her new muslin dress, nimbly did, to the discomfiture of the

terrified shriek.

if anne had tumbled off the roof on the side up which she had ascended
diana would probably have fallen heir to the pearl bead ring then and
there. fortunately she fell on the other side, where the roof extended
down over the porch so nearly to the ground that a fall therefrom was
a much less serious thing. nevertheless, when diana and the other
girls had rushed frantically around the house--except ruby gillis, who
remained as if rooted to the ground and went into hysterics--they found
anne lying all white and limp among the wreck and ruin of the virginia
creeper.

beside her friend. â€œoh, anne, dear anne, speak just one word to me and

has the loveliest fair curly hair and such fascinating eyes. she dresses
beautifully, and her sleeve puffs are bigger than anybody elseâ€™s in
avonlea. every other friday afternoon she has recitations and everybody
has to say a piece or take part in a dialogue. oh, itâ€™s just glorious to
think of it. josie pye says she hates it but that is just because josie
has so little imagination. diana and ruby gillis and jane andrews are
preparing a dialogue, called â€˜a morning visit,â€™ for next friday. and the
friday afternoons they donâ€™t have recitations miss stacy takes them
all to the woods for a â€˜fieldâ€™ day and they study ferns and flowers
and birds. and they have physical culture exercises every morning and
evening. mrs. lynde says she never heard of such goings on and it all
comes of having a lady teacher. but i think it must be splendid and i

of silver and there were such heaps of rustling leaves in the hollows of
many-stemmed woods to run crisply through. the birch path was a canopy
of yellow and the ferns were sear and brown all along it. there was a
tang in the very air that inspired the hearts of small maidens tripping,
unlike snails, swiftly and willingly to school; and it _was_ jolly to
be back again at the little brown desk beside diana, with ruby gillis
nodding across the aisle and carrie sloane sending up notes and julia
bell passing a â€œchewâ€ of gum down from the back seat. anne drew a long
breath of happiness as she sharpened her pencil and arranged her picture

just as ridiculous as a fat one, but i do not let myself mind what josie

carriage, and she fainted in his arms and he carried her home three
miles; because, you understand, the carriage was all smashed up. i found
it rather hard to imagine the proposal because i had no experience to
go by. i asked ruby gillis if she knew anything about how men proposed
because i thought sheâ€™d likely be an authority on the subject, having so
many sisters married. ruby told me she was hid in the hall pantry when
malcolm andres proposed to her sister susan. she said malcolm told susan
that his dad had given him the farm in his own name and then said, â€˜what
do you say, darling pet, if we get hitched this fall?â€™ and susan said,
â€˜yes--no--i donâ€™t know--let me seeâ€™--and there they were, engaged as
quick as that

him in a speech a page long. i can tell you i took a lot of trouble
with that speech. i rewrote it five times and i look upon it as my
masterpiece. bertram gave her a diamond ring and a ruby necklace

hought of a plan, diana. let you and me have a story club all our

miss stacy says so. only we must take the right way. i told her about
the haunted wood, but she said we went the wrong way about it in that.â€

this was how the story club came into existence. it was limited to diana
and anne at first, but soon it was extended to include jane andrews
and ruby gillis and one or two others who felt that their imaginations
needed cultivating. no boys were allowed in it--although ruby gillis
opined that their admission would make it more exciting--and each member
had to produce one story a week.

â€œitâ€™s extremely interesting,â€ anne told marilla. â€œeach girl has to read
her story out loud and then we talk it over. we are going to keep them
all sacredly and have them to read to our descendants. we each write

then diana puts too many murders into hers. she says most of the time

when thereâ€™s two or three of us in the flat and we can sit up. itâ€™s fun
then. but to lie down and pretend i was dead--i just couldnâ€™t. iâ€™d die
really of fright.â€

â€œof course it would be romantic,â€ conceded jane andrews, â€œbut i know i
couldnâ€™t keep still. iâ€™d be popping up every minute or so to see where i
was and if i wasnâ€™t drifting too far out. and you know, anne, that would

there isnâ€™t room for two in the flat when one is lying down. we must
pall the barge all its length in blackest samite. that old black shawl
of your motherâ€™s will be just the thing, diana.â€

the black shawl having been procured, anne spread it over the flat and
then lay down on the bottom, with closed eyes and hands folded over her
breast.

â€œoh, she does look really dead,â€ whispered ruby gillis nervously,
watching the still, white little face under the flickering shadows of
the birches. â€œit makes me feel frightened, girls. do you suppose itâ€™s
really right to act like this? mrs. lynde says that all play-acting is
abominably wicked.â€

â€œruby, you shouldnâ€™t talk about mrs. lynde,â€ said anne severely. â€œit
spoils the effect because this is hundreds of years before mrs. lynde
was born. jane, you arrange this. itâ€™s silly for elaine to be talking
when sheâ€™s dead.â€

but still--! altogether, anne rather thought it would be a relief to
sit down and have a good cry. she was really quite unstrung, for the
reaction from her fright and cramped clinging was making itself felt.

halfway up the path she met jane and diana rushing back to the pond in
a state narrowly removed from positive frenzy. they had found nobody at
orchard slope, both mr. and mrs. barry being away. here ruby gillis had
succumbed to hysterics, and was left to recover from them as best she
might, while jane and diana flew through the haunted wood and across the
brook to green gables. there they had found nobody either, for marilla
had gone to carmody and matthew was making hay in the back field.

â€œoh, anne,â€ gasped diana, fairly falling on the formerâ€™s neck
and weeping with relief and delight, â€œoh, anne--we thought--you
were--drowned--and we felt like murderers--because we had made--you

gray fairy with a rainbow scarf that came tiptoeing along the last
moonlight night and did it. diana wouldnâ€™t say much about that, though.
diana has never forgotten the scolding her mother gave her about
imagining ghosts into the haunted wood. it had a very bad effect on
dianaâ€™s imagination. it blighted it. mrs. lynde says myrtle bell is a
blighted being. i asked ruby gillis why myrtle was blighted, and ruby
said she guessed it was because her young man had gone back on her. ruby
gillis thinks of nothing but young men, and the older she gets the worse
she is. young men are all very well in their place, but it doesnâ€™t do to
drag them into everything, does it? diana and i are thinking seriously
of promising each other that we will never marry but be nice old maids
and live together forever. diana hasnâ€™t quite made up her mind though,
because she thinks perhaps it

proper reading for sunday, and i only read it on weekdays. and i never
read _any_ book now unless either miss stacy or mrs. allan thinks it is a
proper book for a girl thirteen and three-quarters to read. miss stacy
made me promise that. she found me reading a book one day called, the
lurid mystery of the haunted hall. it was one ruby gillis had lent me,
and, oh, marilla, it was so fascinating and creepy. it just curdled the
blood in my veins. but miss stacy said it was a very silly, unwholesome
book, and she asked me not to read any more of it or any like it. i
didnâ€™t mind promising not to read any more like it, but it was _agonizing_
to give back that book without knowing how it turned out. but my love
for miss stacy stood the test and i did. itâ€™s really wonderful, marilla,
what you can do when youâ€™re truly anxious to pleas

â€œi shall take more interest than ever in my studies now,â€ said anne
blissfully, â€œbecause i have a purpose in life. mr. allan says everybody
should have a purpose in life and pursue it faithfully. only he says
we must first make sure that it is a worthy purpose. i would call it a
worthy purpose to want to be a teacher like miss stacy, wouldnâ€™t you,
marilla? i think itâ€™s a very noble profession.â€

the queenâ€™s class was organized in due time. gilbert blythe, anne

spurgeon macpherson joined it. diana barry did not, as her parents
did not intend to send her to queenâ€™s. this seemed nothing short of a
calamity to anne. never, since the night on which minnie may had had the
croup, had she and diana been separated in anything. on the evening when
the queenâ€™s class first remained in school for the extra lessons and
anne saw diana go slowly out with the others, to walk home alone through

this world, thatâ€™s what. there was no ciphering her out by the rules
that worked with other children. itâ€™s nothing short of wonderful how
sheâ€™s improved these three years, but especially in looks. sheâ€™s a real
pretty girl got to be, though i canâ€™t say iâ€™m overly partial to that
pale, big-eyed style myself. i like more snap and color, like diana
barry has or ruby gillis. ruby gillisâ€™s looks are real showy. but
somehow--i donâ€™t know how it is but when anne and them are together,
though she ainâ€™t half as handsome, she makes them look kind of common
and overdone--something like them white june lilies she calls narcissus

the crisp golden air, with the homelights of avonlea twinkling beyond,
were the best and dearest hours in the whole week.

gilbert blythe nearly always walked with ruby gillis and carried her
satchel for her. ruby was a very handsome young lady, now thinking
herself quite as grown up as she really was; she wore her skirts as long
as her mother would let her and did her hair up in town, though she had
to take it down when she went home. she had large, bright-blue eyes,
a brilliant complexion, and a plump showy figure. she laughed a great
deal, was cheerful and good-tempered, and enjoyed the pleasant things of
life frankly.

â€œbut i shouldnâ€™t think she was the sort

 whispered jane to anne. anne did not think so either, but she would not
have said so for the avery scholarship. she could not help thinking,
too, that it would be very pleasant to have such a friend as gilbert
to jest and chatter with and exchange ideas about books and studies and
ambitions. gilbert had ambitions, she knew, and ruby gillis did not seem
the sort of person with whom such could be profitably discussed.

there was no silly sentiment in anneâ€™s ideas concerning gilbert. boys
were to her, when she thought about them at all, merely possible good
comrades. if she and gilbert had been friends she would not have cared
how many other friends he had nor with whom he walked. she had a genius
for friendship; girl friends she had in plenty; but she had a vague
consciousness that masculine friendship might also be a good thing

could have put her
feelings on the matter into just such clear definition. but she thought
that if gilbert had ever walked home with her from the train, over the
crisp fields and along the ferny byways, they might have had many and
merry and interesting conversations about the new world that was opening
around them and their hopes and ambitions therein. gilbert was a clever
young fellow, with his own thoughts about things and a determination to
get the best out of life and put the best into it. ruby gillis told jane
andrews that she didnâ€™t understand half the things gilbert blythe said;
he talked just like anne shirley did when she had a thoughtful fit on
and for her part she didnâ€™t think it any fun to be bothering about books
and that sort of thing when you didnâ€™t have to. frank stockley had lots
more dash and go, but then he wasnâ€™t half as good-looking as gilbert and
she really couldnâ€™t decide which she liked best!

in the academy anne gradually drew a little circle of friends about

the various classes had assumed distinct and settled shadings of
individuality. certain facts had become generally accepted. it was
admitted that the medal contestants had practically narrowed down
to three--gilbert blythe, anne shirley, and lewis wilson; the avery
scholarship was more doubtful, any one of a certain six being a possible
winner. the bronze medal for mathematics was considered as good as
won by a fat, funny little up-country boy with a bumpy forehead and a
patched coat.

ruby gillis was the handsomest girl of the year at the academy; in the
second year classes stella maynard carried off the palm for beauty, with
small but critical minority in favor of anne shirley. ethel marr was
admitted by all competent judges to have the most stylish modes
of hair-dressing, and jane andrews--plain, plodding, conscientious
jane--carried off the honors in the domestic science course. even josie
pye attained a certain preeminence as the sharpest-tongued young lady in
attendance at queenâ€™
