John Gilbert - 
A young settler from Springfield whom the Indians hold captive. John
is ill and suffering when Rowlandson visits him in a settlement near Hadley.
Underclothed and left outside, along with an orphaned Indian baby, John moves
Rowlandson to pity. His predicament exemplifies the Indians' cruelty and the
extent to which all captives are reduced to dependence on the kindness of
strangers.
