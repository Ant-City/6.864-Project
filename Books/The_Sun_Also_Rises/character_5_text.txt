"we'll watch him with the glasses," i said.

"oh, to hell with him!"

"he spends a lot of time there."

"i want him to stay there."

in the hotel on the stairs we met montoya.

"come on," said montoya. "do you want to meet pedro romero?"

"fine," said bill. "let's go see him."

we followed montoya up a flight and down the corridor.

"he's in room number eight," montoya explained. "he's getting dressed for the bull-fight."

montoya knocked on the door and opened it. it was a gloomy room with a little light coming in from the

window on the narrow street. there were two beds separated by a monastic partition. the electric light was on. the
boy stood very straight and unsmiling in his bull-fighting clothes. his jacket hung over

were just finishing winding his sash. his black hair shone under the electric light. he wore a white linen shirt and
the swordhandler finished his sash and stood up and stepped back. pedro romero nodded, seeming very far away
and dignified when we shook hands. montoya said something about what great aficionados we were, and that we
wanted to wish him luck. romero listened very seriously. then he turned to me. he was the best-looking boy i have
ever seen.




me to interpret for you? is there anything you would like to ask pedro romero?"

we thanked him. what was there that you would like to ask? the boy was nineteen years old, alone except for
his sword-handlet and the three hangers-on,

alone in the room with the hangers-on as we shut the door.
"he's a fine boy, don't you think so?" montoya asked.

"he's a good-looking kid," i said.


"he looks like a torero," montoya said. "he has the type."
"he's a fine boy."

"we'll see how he is in the ring," montoya said.


we found the big leather wine-bottle leaning against the wall in my room, took it and the field-glasses, locked
the door, and went down-stairs.

it was a good bull-fight. bill and i were very excited about pedro romero. montoya was sitting about ten
places away. after romero had killed his first bull montoya caught my eye and nodded his head. this was a real
one. there had not been a real one for a long time. of the other two matadors, one was very fair and the other was
passable. but there was no comparison with romero, although neither of his bulls was much.

"you go to the bull-fight," he said in english.
"you know english," i said, feeling like an idiot.
"no," he answered, and smiled.

stood, his cape against his chest, looking across the ring to where the bull would come out.




was no bull-fight scheduled. but all day and all night the fiesta kept on.















after it was over we went out and were pressed tight in the crowd.
"these bull-fights are hell on one," brett said. "i'm limp as a rag."
"oh, you'll get a drink," mike said.
the next day pedro romero did not fight. it was miura bulls, and a very bad bull-fight. the next day there

"this next is the last one."
"not really," brett said. she leaned forward on the barrera. romero waved his picadors to their places, then

aid. "everybody's seen them."
"i've seen them, too," montoya said. he didn't say anything. i went on shaving.
"sit down," i said. "let me send for a drink."
"no, i have to go."
i finished shaving and put my face down into the bowl and washed it with cold water. montoya was standing

montoya stood embarrassed. he wanted me to say something.
"don't give romero the message," i said.
"you think so?"
"absolutely."

"look," he said. "i've just had a message from them at the grand hotel that they want pedro romero and

"marcial has been in san sebastian all day. he drove over in a car this morning with marquez. i don't think

"bill's a yell of laughter," mike said.


i was drinking red wine, and so far behind them that i felt a little uncomfortable about all this shoe-shining. i
looked around the room. at the next table was pedro romero. he stood up when i nodded, and asked me to come
over and meet a friend. his table was beside ours, almost touching. i met the friend, a madrid bullfight critic, a little
man with a drawn face. i told romero how much i liked his work, and he was very pleased. we talked spanish and
the critic knew a little french. i reached to our table for my winebottle, but the critic took my arm. romero laughed.
"drink here," he said in english.


he was very bashful about his english, but he was really very

pleased with it, and as we went on talking he
brought out words he was not sure of, and asked me about them. he was anxious to know the english for _corrida
de  toros_,  the  exact  translation.  bull-fight  he  was  suspicious  of.  i  explained  that  bull-fight  in  spanish  was  the
_lidia_ of a _toro_. the spanish word _corrida_ means in english the running of bulls--the french translation is
_course de taureaux_. the critic put that in. there is no spanish word for bull-fight.
pedro romero said he had learned a little english in gibraltar. he was born in ronda. that is not far above

gibraltar. he started bull-fighting in malaga in the bull-fighting school there. he had only been at it three years. the
bull-fight critic joked him about the number of _malagueno_ expressions he used. he was nineteen years old, he
said. his older brother was with him as a banderillero, but he did not live in this hotel. he lived in a smaller hotel
with the other people who worked for romero. he aske

ow it to you."
when he said this he smiled, anxious that neither the bull-fight critic nor i would think he was boasting.

"i am anxious to see it," the critic said. "i would like to be convinced."

"he doesn't like my work much." romero turned to me. he was serious.

the critic explained that he liked it very much, but that so far it had been incomplete.

"wait till to-morrow, if a good one comes out."

"have you seen the bulls for to-morrow?" the critic asked me.

"yes. i saw them unloaded."

pedro romero leaned forward.

"what did you think of them?"

"very nice," i said. "about twenty-six arrobas. very short horns. haven't you seen them?"

"oh, yes," said romero.

"they won't weigh twenty-six arrobas," said the critic.

"no," said romero.

"they've got bananas for horns," the critic said.

"you call them bananas?" asked romero. he turned to me and smiled. "_you_ wouldn't call them bananas?"

"no," i said. "they're horns all right."

"they're very short," said pedro romero. "very, very short. s

till, they aren't bananas."

"i say, jake," brett called from the next table, "you _have_ deserted us."

"just temporarily," i said. "we're talking bulls."

"you _are_ superior."

"tell him that bulls have no balls," mike shouted. he was drunk.

romero looked at me inquiringly.

"drunk," i said. "borracho! muy borracho!"


"you might introduce your friends," brett said. she had not stopped looking at pedro romero. i asked them if
they  would  like  to  have  coffee  with  us.  they  both  stood  up.  romero's  face  was  very  brown.  he  had  very  nice
manners.

i introduced them all around and they started to sit down, but there was not enough room, so we all moved
over to the big table by the wall to have coffee. mike ordered a bottle of fundador and glasses for everybody. there
was a lot of drunken talking.






"tell him i think writing is lousy," bill said. "go on, tell him. tell him i'm ashamed

 of being a writer."
pedro romero was sitting beside brett and listening to her.
"go on. tell him!" bill said.
romero looked up smiling.
"this gentleman," i said, "is a writer."





romero was impressed. "this other one, too," i said, pointing at cohn.
"he looks like villalta," romero said, looking at bill. "rafael, doesn't he look like villalta?"
"i can't see it," the critic said.
"really," romero said in spanish. "he looks a lot like villalta. what does the drunken one do?"
"nothing."
"is that why he drinks?"
"no. he's wait

"pipe down."
during  this  romero  was  fingering  his  glass  and  talking  with  brett.  brett  was  talking  french  and  he  was




















talking spanish and a little english, and laughing.
bill was filling the glasses.

"tell him brett wants to come into--"

"oh, pipe down, mike, for christ's sake!"

romero looked up smiling. "pipe down! i know that," he said.


just then montoya came into the room. he started to smile at me, then he saw pedro romero with a big glass
of cognac in his hand, sitting laughing between me and a woman with bare shoulders, at a table full of drunks. he
did not even nod.

montoya went out of the room. mike was on his feet proposing a toast. "let's all drink to--" he began. "pedro
romero," i said. everybody stood up. romero took it very seriously, and we touched glasses and drank it down, i
rushing it a little because mike was trying to make it clear that that was not at all what he was going to drink to. but

"oh, shut up, mike! nobody interrupted you."


"no, i'd like to get this settled." he turned away from me. "do you think you amount to something, cohn? do
you think you belong here among us? people who are out to have a good time? for god's sake don't be so noisy,
cohn!"

"oh, cut it out, mike," cohn said.

"ask him to come over and have a drink."
"not yet. he'll come over."
"i can't look at him."
"he's nice to look at," i said.
"i've always done just what i wanted."
"i know."
"i do feel such a bitch."
"well," i said.
"my god!" said brett, "the things a woman goes through."
"yes?"
"oh, i do feel such a bitch."
i looked across at the table. pedro romero smiled. he said something to the other people at his table, and

"won't you have a drink?"
"you  must  have  a  drink  with  me,"  he  said.  he  seated  himself,  asking  brett's  permission  without  saying





"you fight to-morrow?" i said.
"yes," he said. "algabeno was hurt to-day in madrid. did you hear?"
"no," i said. "badly?"
he shook his head.
"nothing. here," he showed his hand. brett reached out and spread the fingers apart.
"oh!" he said in english, "you tell fortunes?"
"sometimes.

"no. knocked me out. that was all."
"i say, he did hurt pedro romero," brett said. "he hurt him most badly."
"how is he?"
"he'll be all right. he won't go out of the room."
"does he look badly?"
"very. he was really hurt. i told him i wanted to pop out and see you chaps for a minute."
