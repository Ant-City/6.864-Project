enter king john, queen elinor, pembroke, essex, salisbury, and
others,
with chatillon

  king john. now, say, chatillon, what would france with us?
  chatillon. thus, after greeting, speaks the king of france
    in my behaviour to the majesty,
    the borrowed majesty, of england here.
  elinor. a strange beginning- 'borrowed majesty'!
  king john. silence, good mother; hear the embassy.
  chatillon. philip of france, in right and true behalf
    of thy deceased brother geffrey's son,
    arthur plantagenet, lays most lawful claim
    to this fair island and the territories,
    t

o ireland, poictiers, anjou, touraine, maine,
    desiring thee to lay aside the sword
    which sways usurpingly these several titles,
    and put the same into young arthur's hand,
    thy nephew and right royal sovereign.
  king john. what follows if we disallow of this?
  chatillon. the proud control of fierce and bloody war,
    to enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.
  king john. here have we war for war, and blood for blood,
    controlment for controlment- so answer france.
  chatillon. then take my king's defiance from my mouth-
    the farthest limit of my embassy.
  king john. bear mine to him, and so depart in peace;
    be thou as lightning in the eyes of france;
    for ere thou canst report i will be there,
    the thunder of my cannon shall be heard.
    so hence! be thou the trumpet of our wrath
    and sullen presage of your own decay.

pembroke
  elinor. what now, my son! have i not ever said
    how that ambitious constance would not cease
    till she had kindled france and all the world
    upon the right and party of her son?
    this might have been prevented and made whole
    with very easy arguments of love,
    which now the manage of two kingdoms must
    with fearful bloody issue arbitrate.
  king john. our strong possession and our right for us!
  elinor. your strong possession much more than your right,
    or else it must go wrong with you and me;
    so much my conscience whispers in your ear,
    which none but heaven and you and i shall hear.

                     brother

    what men are you?
  bastard. your faithful subject i, a gentleman
    born in northamptonshire, and eldest son,
    as i suppose, to robert faulconbridge-
    a soldier by the honour-giving hand
    of coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.
  king john. what art thou?
  robert. the son and heir to that same faulconbridge.
  king john. is that the elder, and art thou the heir?
    you came not of one mother then, it seems.
  bastard. most certain of one mother, mighty king-
    that is well known- and, as i think, one father;
    but for the certain knowledge of that truth
    i put you o'er to heaven and to my mother.
    of that i doubt, as all men's children may.
  elinor. out on thee, rude man! thou dost shame thy mother,
    and

 wound her honour with this diffidence.
  bastard. i, madam? no, i have no reason for it-
    that is my brother's plea, and none of mine;
    the which if he can prove, 'a pops me out
    at least from fair five hundred pound a year.
    heaven guard my mother's honour and my land!
  king john. a good blunt fellow. why, being younger born,
    doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?
  bastard. i know not why, except to get the land.
    but once he slander'd me with bastardy;
    but whe'er i be as true begot or no,
    that still i lay upon my mother's head;
    but that i am as well begot, my liege-
    fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!-
    compare our faces and be judge yourself.
    if old sir robert did beget us both
    and were our father, and this son

    o old sir robert, father, on my knee
    i give heaven thanks i was not like to thee!
  king john. why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!
  elinor. he hath a trick of coeur-de-lion's face;
    the accent of his tongue affecteth him.
    do you not read some tokens of my son
    in the large composition of this man?
  king john. mine eye hath well examined his parts
    and finds them perfect richard. sirrah, speak,
    what doth move you to claim your brother's land?
  bastard. because he hath a half-face, like my father.
    with half that face would he have all my land:
    a half-fac'd groat five hundred pound a year!
  robert. my gracious liege, when that my father liv'd,
    your brother did employ my father much-
  bastard. well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:
    your tale must be how he employ'

lengths of seas and shores
    between my father and my mother lay,
    as i have heard my father speak himself,
    when this same lusty gentleman was got.
    upon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd
    his lands to me, and took it on his death
    that this my mother's son was none of his;
    and if he were, he came into the world
    full fourteen weeks before the course of time.
    then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,
    my father's land, as was my father's will.
  king john. sirrah, your brother is legitimate:
    your father's wife did after wedlock bear him,
    and if she did play false, the fault was hers;
    which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
    that marry wives. tell me, how if my brother,
    who, as you say, took pains to get this son,
    had of your father claim'd this son for his?
    in sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
    this calf, bred from his cow, from all the world;
    in sooth, he might; then, if he were m

    your face hath got five hundred pound a year,
    yet sell your face for fivepence and 'tis dear.
    madam, i'll follow you unto the death.
  elinor. nay, i would have you go before me thither.
  bastard. our country manners give our betters way.
  king john. what is thy name?
  bastard. philip, my liege, so is my name begun:
    philip, good old sir robert's wife's eldest son.
  king john. from henceforth bear his name whose form thou
bearest:
    kneel thou down philip, but rise more great-
    arise sir richard and plantagenet.

  king john. go, faulconbridge; now hast thou thy desire:
    a landless knight makes thee a landed squire.
    come, madam, and come, richard, we must speed
    for france, for france, for it is more than need.

    that geffrey was thy elder brother born,
    and this his son; england was geffrey's right,
    and this is geffrey's. in the name of god,

    in any breast of strong authority
    to look into the blots and stains of right.
    that judge hath made me guardian to this boy,

    to our own vantage.
  king john. we will heal up all,

  hubert. my lord, they say five moons were seen to-night;
    four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about
    the other four in wondrous motion.
  king john. five moons!
  hubert. old men and beldams in the streets
    do prophesy upon it dangerously;
    young arthur's death is common in their mouths;
    and when they talk of him, they shake their heads,
    and whisper one another in the ear;
    and he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,
    whilst he that hears makes fearful action
    with wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.
    i saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,

    standing on slippers, which his nimble haste
    had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,
    told of a many thousand warlike french
    that were embattailed and rank'd in kent.
    another lean unwash'd artificer
    cuts off his tale, and talks of arthur's death.
  king john. why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?
    why urgest thou so oft young arthur's death?
    thy hand hath murd'red him. i had a mighty cause
    to wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.
  hubert. no had, my lord! why, did you not provoke me?
  king john. it is the curse of kings to be attended
    by slaves that take their humours for a warrant
    to break within the bloody house of life,
    and on the winking of authority
    to understand a law; to know the mea

    young arthur is alive. this hand of mine
    is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,
    not painted with the crimson spots of blood.
    within this bosom never ent'red yet
    the dreadful motion of a murderous thought
    and you have slander'd nature in my form,
    which, howsoever rude exteriorly,
    is yet the cover of a fairer mind
    than to be butcher of an innocent child.
  king john. doth arthur live? o, haste thee to the peers,
    throw this report on their incensed rage
    and make them tame to their obedience!
    forgive the comment that my passion made
    upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,
    and foul imaginary eyes of blood
    presented thee more hideous than thou art.
    o, answer not; but to my closet bring
    the angry lords with all expedient haste.
    i conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.
