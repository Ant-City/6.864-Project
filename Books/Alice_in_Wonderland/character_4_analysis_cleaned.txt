the [CHARACTER] 
the [CHARACTER] is unique among wonderland creatures.
threatened by no one, it maintains a cool, grinning outsider status.
the [CHARACTER] has insight into the workings of wonderland as
a whole. its calm explanation to alice that to be in wonderland
is to be "mad" reveals a number of points that do not occur to alice
on her own. first, the [CHARACTER] points out that wonderland as
a place has a stronger cumulative effect than any of its citizens.
wonderland is ruled by nonsense, and as a result, alice's normal
behavior becomes inconsistent with its operating principles, so
alice herself becomes mad in the context of wonderland. certainly, alice's
burning curiosity to absorb everything she sees in wonderland sets
her apart from the other wonderland creatures, making her seem mad
in comparison.
