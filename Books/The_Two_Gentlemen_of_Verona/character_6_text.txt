valentine: protheus, and speed.

  valentine. cease to perswade, my louing protheus;
home-keeping youth, haue euer homely wits,
wer't not affection chaines thy tender dayes
to the sweet glaunces of thy honour'd loue,
i rather would entreat thy company,
to see the wonders of the world abroad,
then (liuing dully sluggardiz'd at home)
weare out thy youth with shapelesse idlenesse.
but since thou lou'st; loue still, and thriue therein,
euen as i would, when i to loue begin

   pro. wilt thou be gone? sweet valentine adew,
thinke on thy protheus, when thou (hap'ly) seest
some rare note-worthy obiect in thy trauaile.
wish me partaker in thy happinesse,
when thou do'st meet good

ule mischance
torment me for my loues forgetfulnesse:
my father staies my comming: answere not:
the tide is now; nay, not thy tide of teares,
that tide will stay me longer then i should,
iulia, farewell: what, gon without a word?
i, so true loue should doe: it cannot speake,
for truth hath better deeds, then words to grace it

   panth. sir protheus: you are staid for

   pro. goe: i come, i come:
alas, this parting strikes poore louers dumbe.

scoena tertia.

enter launce, panthion.

  launce. nay, 'twill bee this howre ere i haue done
weeping: all the kinde of the launces, haue this very
fault: i haue receiu'd my proportion, like the prodigious
sonne, and am going with sir protheus to the imperialls
court: i thinke crab my dog, be the sowrest natured
dogge that liues: my mother weeping: my father
wayling: my sister crying: our maid howling: our
catte wringing her hands, and all our house in a great
perplexitie, yet did not this cruell-hearted curre sh

e: i; so, so: now
come i to my father; father, your blessing: now
should not the shooe speake a word for weeping:
now should i kisse my father; well, hee weepes on:
now come i to my mother: oh that she could speake
now, like a would-woman: well, i kisse her: why
there 'tis; heere's my mothers breath vp and downe:
now come i to my sister; marke the moane she makes:
now the dogge all this while sheds not a teare: nor
speakes a word: but see how i lay the dust with my
teares

   panth. launce, away, away: a boord: thy master is
ship'd, and thou art to post after with oares; what's the
matter? why weep'st thou man? away asse, you'l loose
the tide, if you tarry any longer

   laun. it is no matter if the tide were lost, for it is the
vnkindest tide, that euer any man tide

   panth. what's the vnkindest tide?
  lau. why, he that's tide here, crab my dog

   pant. tut, man: i meane thou'lt loose the flood, and
in loosing the flood, loose thy voyage, and in loosing thy
voya

 i loue him not as i was wont:
o, but i loue his lady too-too much,
and that's the reason i loue him so little.
how shall i doate on her with more aduice,
that thus without aduice begin to loue her?
'tis but her picture i haue yet beheld,
and that hath dazel'd my reasons light:
but when i looke on her perfections,
there is no reason, but i shall be blinde.
if i can checke my erring loue, i will,
if not, to compasse her ile vse my skill.

exeunt.


scena quinta.

enter speed and launce.

  speed. launce, by mine honesty welcome to padua

   laun. forsweare not thy selfe, sweet youth, for i am
not welcome. i reckon this alwaies, that a man is neuer
vndon till hee be hang'd, nor neuer welcome to a place,
till some certaine shot be paid, and the hostesse say welcome

   speed. come-on you mad-cap: ile to the ale-house
with you presently; where, for one shot of fiue pence,
thou shalt haue fiue thousand welcomes: but sirha, how
did thy master part with madam iulia?

at i do too: looke thee, ile but leane,
and my staffe vnderstands me

   spee. it stands vnder thee indeed

   lau. why, stand-vnder: and vnder-stand is all one

   spee. but tell me true, wil't be a match?
  lau. aske my dogge, if he say i, it will: if hee say
no, it will: if hee shake his taile, and say nothing, it
will

   spee. the conclusion is then, that it will

   lau. thou shalt neuer get such a secret from me, but
by a parable

   spee. 'tis well that i get it so: but launce, how saist
thou that that my master is become a notable louer?
  lau. i neuer knew him otherwise

   spee. then how?
  lau. a notable lubber: as thou reportest him to
bee

   spee. why, thou whorson asse, thou mistak'st me,
  lau. why foole, i meant not thee, i meant thy
master

   spee. i tell thee, my master is become a hot louer

   lau. why, i tell thee, i care not, though hee burne
himselfe in loue. if thou wilt goe with me to the alehouse:
if not, thou art an hebrew, a iew

 that wrong,
to beare a hard opinion of his truth:
onely deserue my loue, by louing him,
and presently goe with me to my chamber
to take a note of what i stand in need of,
to furnish me vpon my longing iourney:
all that is mine i leaue at thy dispose,
my goods, my lands, my reputation,
onely, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence:
come; answere not: but to it presently,
i am impatient of my tarriance.

exeunt.

  duke. sir thurio, giue vs leaue (i pray) a while,
we haue some secrets to confer about.
now tell me protheus, what's your will with me?
  pro. my gracious lord, that which i wold discouer,
the law of friendship bids me to conceale,
but when i call to minde your gracious fauours
done to me (vndeseruing as i am)
my dutie pricks me on to vtter that
which else, no worldly good should draw from me:
know (worthy prince) sir valentine my friend
this night intends to steale away

staffe, walke hence with that
and manage it, against despairing thoughts:
thy letters may be here, though thou art hence,
which, being writ to me, shall be deliuer'd
euen in the milke-white bosome of thy loue.
the time now serues not to expostulate,
come, ile conuey thee through the city-gate.
and ere i part with thee, confer at large
of all that may concerne thy loue-affaires:
as thou lou'st siluia (though not for thy selfe)
regard thy danger, and along with me

   val. i pray thee launce, and if thou seest my boy
bid him make haste, and meet me at the north-gate

   pro. goe sirha, finde him out: come valentine

   val. oh my deere siluia; haplesse valentine

   launce. i am but a foole, looke you, and yet i haue
the wit to thinke my master is a kinde of a knaue: but
that's all one, if he be but one knaue: he liues not now
that knowes me to be in loue, yet i am in loue, but a
teeme of horse shall not plucke that from me: nor who
'tis i loue: and yet 'tis a woman; bu

: yet 'tis
not a maid: for shee hath had gossips: yet 'tis a maid,
for she is her masters maid, and serues for wages. shee
hath more qualities then a water-spaniell, which is
much in a bare christian: heere is the catelog of her
condition. inprimis. shee can fetch and carry: why
a horse can doe no more; nay, a horse cannot fetch, but
onely carry, therefore is shee better then a iade. item.
she can milke, looke you, a sweet vertue in a maid with
cleane hands

   speed. how now signior launce? what newes with
your mastership?
  la. with my mastership? why, it is at sea:

newes then in your paper?
