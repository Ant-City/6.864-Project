™ said mr. creakle, with his veins
swelling again bigger than ever, â€˜that youâ€™ve been in a wrong position
altogether, and mistook this for a charity school. mr. mell, weâ€™ll part,
if you please. the sooner the better.â€™

â€˜there is no time,â€™ answered mr. mell, rising, â€˜like the present.â€™

â€˜sir, to you!â€™ said mr. creakle.

â€˜i take my leave of you, mr. creakle, and all of you,â€™ said mr. mell,
glancing round the room, and again patting me gently on the shoulders.
â€˜james steerforth, the best wish i can leave you is that you may come to
be ashamed of what you have done today. at present i would prefer to see
you anything rather than a friend, to me, or to anyone in whom i feel an
interest.â€™

once more he laid his hand upon my shoulder; and then taking his
flute and a few books from his desk, and leaving the key in it for his
successor, he went out of the school, with his property under his arm.
mr. creakle then made a speech, through tungay, in which he thanked

you are a true man!â€™

â€˜miss dartle,â€™ i returned, â€˜you are surely not so unjust as to condemn
me!â€™

â€˜why do you bring division between these two mad creatures?â€™ she
returned. â€˜donâ€™t you know that they are both mad with their own
self-will and pride?â€™

â€˜is it my doing?â€™ i returned.

â€˜is it your doing!â€™ she retorted. â€˜why do you bring this man here?â€™

â€˜he is a deeply-injured man, miss dartle,â€™ i replied. â€˜you may not know
it.â€™

â€˜i know that james steerforth,â€™ she said, with her hand on her bosom, as
if to prevent the storm that was raging there, from being loud, â€˜has
a false, corrupt heart, and is a traitor. but what need i know or care
about this fellow, and his common niece?â€™

â€˜miss dartle,â€™ i returned, â€˜you deepen the injury. it is sufficient
already. i will only say, at parting, that you do him a great wrong.â€™

â€˜i do him no wrong,â€™ she returned. â€˜they are a depraved, worthless set.
i would have her whipped!â€™

eturned miss dartle, â€˜i have come to look at you. what? you are
not ashamed of the face that has done so much?â€™

the resolute and unrelenting hatred of her tone, its cold stern
sharpness, and its mastered rage, presented her before me, as if i had
seen her standing in the light. i saw the flashing black eyes, and the
passion-wasted figure; and i saw the scar, with its white track cutting
through her lips, quivering and throbbing as she spoke.

â€˜i have come to see,â€™ she said, â€˜james steerforthâ€™s fancy; the girl who
ran away with him, and is the town-talk of the commonest people of her
native place; the bold, flaunting, practised companion of persons like
james steerforth. i want to know what such a thing is like.â€™

there was a rustle, as if the unhappy girl, on whom she heaped these
taunts, ran towards the door, and the speaker swiftly interposed herself
before it. it was succeeded by a momentâ€™s pause.

when miss dartle spoke again, it was through her set teeth, and wi

would he never, never come? how long was i to bear this? how long could
i bear it? â€˜oh me, oh me!â€™ exclaimed the wretched emily, in a tone that
might have touched the hardest heart, i should have thought; but there
was no relenting in rosa dartleâ€™s smile. â€˜what, what, shall i do!â€™

â€˜do?â€™ returned the other. â€˜live happy in your own reflections!

tenderness--he would have made you his serving-manâ€™s wife, would he

the consciousness of your own virtues, and the honourable position to
