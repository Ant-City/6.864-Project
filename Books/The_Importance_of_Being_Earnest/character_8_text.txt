e, miss prism, with pleasure.  we might go as far as the schools and back.

miss prism.  that would be delightful.  cecily, you will read your political economy in my absence.  the chapter on the fall of the rupee you may omit.  it is somewhat too sensational.  even these metallic problems have their melodramatic side.

[goes down the garden with dr. chasuble.]

cecily.  [picks up books and throws them back on table.]  horrid political economy!  horrid geography!  horrid, horrid german!

[enter merriman with a card on a salver.]

merriman.  mr. ernest worthing has just driven over from the station.  he has brought his luggage with him.

cecily.  [takes the card and reads it.]  ‘mr. ernest worthing, b. 4, the albany, w.’  uncle jack’s brother!  did you tell him mr. worthing was in town?

merriman.  yes, miss.  he seemed very much disappointed.  i mentioned that you and miss prism were in the garden.  he said he was anxious to speak to you privately for a moment.

cecily.  ask mr. ernest w

orthing to come here.  i suppose you had better talk to the housekeeper about a room for him.

merriman.  yes, miss.

[merriman goes off.]

cecily.  i have never met any really wicked person before.  i feel rather frightened.  i am so afraid he will look just like every one else.

[enter algernon, very gay and debonnair.]  he does!

algernon.  [raising his hat.]  you are my little cousin cecily, i’m sure.

cecily.  you are under some strange mistake.  i am not little.  in fact, i believe i am more than usually tall for my age.  [algernon is rather taken aback.]  but i am your cousin cecily.  you, i see from your card,

i think we might leave the two brothers together.

miss prism.  cecily, you will come with us.

cecily.  certainly, miss prism.  my little task of reconciliation is over.

chasuble.  you have done a beautiful action to-day, dear child.

miss prism.  we must not be premature in our judgments.

cecily.  i feel very happy.  [they all go off except jack and algernon.]

jack.  you young scoundrel, algy, you must get out of this place as soon as possible.  i don’t allow any bunburying here.

[enter merriman.]

merriman.  i have put mr. ernest’s things in the room next to yours, sir.  i suppose that is all right?

jack.  what?

merriman.  mr. ernest’s luggage, sir.  i have unpacked it and put it in the room next to your own.

jack.  his luggage?

merriman.  yes, sir.  three portmanteaus, a dressing-case, two hat-boxes, and a large luncheon-basket.

algernon.  i am afraid i can’t stay more than a week this time.

jack.  merriman, order the dog-cart at once.  mr. ernest has been suddenly called

 back to town.

merriman.  yes, sir.  [goes back into the house.]

algernon.  what a fearful liar you are, jack.  i have not been called back to town at all.

jack.  yes, you have.

algernon.  i haven’t heard any one call me.

jack.  your duty as a gentleman calls you back.

algernon.  my duty as a gentleman has never interfered with my pleasures in the smallest degree.

jack.  i can quite understand that.

algernon.  well, cecily is a darling.

jack.  you are not to talk of miss cardew like that.  i don’t like it.

 for me.

cecily.  oh, is he going to take you for a nice drive?

algernon.  he’s going to send me away.

cecily.  then have we got to part?

algernon.  i am afraid so.  it’s a very painful parting.

cecily.  it is always painful to part from people whom one has known for a very brief space of time.  the absence of old friends one can endure with equanimity.  but even a momentary separation from anyone to whom one has just been introduced is almost unbearable.

algernon.  thank you.

[enter merriman.]

merriman.  the dog-cart is at the door, sir.  [algernon looks appealingly at cecily.]

cecily.  it can wait, merriman for . . . five minutes.

merriman.  yes, miss.  [exit merriman.]

algernon.  i hope, cecily, i shall not offend you if i state quite frankly and openly that you seem to me to be in every way the visible personification of absolute perfection.

cecily.  i think your frankness does you great credit, ernest.  if you will allow me, i will copy your remarks into my diary.  [goes o

ne should speak fluently and not cough.  besides, i don’t know how to spell a cough.  [writes as algernon speaks.]

algernon.  [speaking very rapidly.]  cecily, ever since i first looked upon your wonderful and incomparable beauty, i have dared to love you wildly, passionately, devotedly, hopelessly.

cecily.  i don’t think that you should tell me that you love me wildly, passionately, devotedly, hopelessly.  hopelessly doesn’t seem to make much sense, does it?

algernon.  cecily!

[enter merriman.]

merriman.  the dog-cart is waiting, sir.

algernon.  tell it to come round next week, at the same hour.

merriman.  [looks at cecily, who makes no sign.]  yes, sir.

[merriman retires.]

cecily.  uncle jack would be very much annoyed if he knew you were staying on till next week, at the same hour.

algernon.  oh, i don’t care about jack.  i don’t care for anybody in the whole world but you.  i love you, cecily.  you will marry me, won’t you?

cecily.  you silly boy!  of course.  why, w

lgernon.  i shan’t be away more than half an hour.

cecily.  considering that we have been engaged since february the 14th, and that i only met you to-day for the first time, i think it is rather hard that you should leave me for so long a period as half an hour.  couldn’t you make it twenty minutes?

algernon.  i’ll be back in no time.

[kisses her and rushes down the garden.]

cecily.  what an impetuous boy he is!  i like his hair so much.  i must enter his proposal in my diary.

[enter merriman.]

merriman.  a miss fairfax has just called to see mr. worthing.  on very important business, miss fairfax states.

cecily.  isn’t mr. worthing in his library?

merriman.  mr. worthing went over in the direction of the rectory some time ago.

cecily.  pray ask the lady to come out here; mr. worthing is sure to be back soon.  and you can bring tea.

merriman.  yes, miss.  [goes out.]

cecily.  miss fairfax!  i suppose one of the many good elderly women who are associated with uncle jack in so

me of his philanthropic work in london.  i don’t quite like women who are interested in philanthropic work.  i think it is so forward of them.

[enter merriman.]

merriman.  miss fairfax.

[enter gwendolen.]

[exit merriman.]

cecily.  [advancing to meet her.]  pray let me introduce myself to you.  my name is cecily cardew.

gwendolen.  cecily cardew?  [moving to her and shaking hands.]  what a very sweet name!  something tells me that we are going to be great friends.  i like you already more than i can say.  my first impressions of people are never wrong.

cecily.  how nice of you to like me so much after we have known each other such a comparatively short time.  pray sit down.

gwendolen.  [still standing up.]

 an entanglement?  you are presumptuous.  on an occasion of this kind it becomes more than a moral duty to speak one’s mind.  it becomes a pleasure.

cecily.  do you suggest, miss fairfax, that i entrapped ernest into an engagement?  how dare you?  this is no time for wearing the shallow mask of manners.  when i see a spade i call it a spade.

gwendolen.  [satirically.]  i am glad to say that i have never seen a spade.  it is obvious that our social spheres have been widely different.

[enter merriman, followed by the footman.  he carries a salver, table cloth, and plate stand.  cecily is about to retort.  the presence of the servants exercises a restraining influence, under which both girls chafe.]

merriman.  shall i lay tea here as usual, miss?

cecily.  [sternly, in a calm voice.]  yes, as usual.  [merriman begins to clear table and lay cloth.  a long pause.  cecily and gwendolen glare at each other.]

gwendolen.  are there many interesting walks in the vicinity, miss cardew?

cecily.  o

testable girl!  but i require tea!

cecily.  [sweetly.]  sugar?

gwendolen.  [superciliously.]  no, thank you.  sugar is not fashionable any more. [cecily looks angrily at her, takes up the tongs and puts four lumps of sugar into the cup.]

cecily.  [severely.]  cake or bread and butter?

gwendolen.  [in a bored manner.]  bread and butter, please.  cake is rarely seen at the best houses nowadays.

cecily.  [cuts a very large slice of cake, and puts it on the tray.]  hand that to miss fairfax.

[merriman does so, and goes out with footman.  gwendolen drinks the tea and makes a grimace.  puts down cup at once, reaches out her hand to the bread and butter, looks at it, and finds it is cake.  rises in indignation.]

gwendolen.  you have filled my tea with lumps of sugar, and though i asked most distinctly for bread and butter, you have given me cake.  i am known for the gentleness of my disposition, and the extraordinary sweetness of my nature, but i warn you, miss cardew, you may go too far.

cecily.  [to algernon.]  to please me you are ready to face this fearful ordeal?

algernon.  i am!

gwendolen.  how absurd to talk of the equality of the sexes!  where questions of self-sacrifice are concerned, men are infinitely beyond us.

jack.  we are.  [clasps hands with algernon.]

cecily.  they have moments of physical courage of which we women know absolutely nothing.

gwendolen.  [to jack.]  darling!

algernon.  [to cecily.]  darling!  [they fall into each other’s arms.]

[enter merriman.  when he enters he coughs loudly, seeing the situation.]

merriman.  ahem!  ahem!  lady bracknell!

jack.  good heavens!

[enter lady bracknell.  the couples separate in alarm.  exit merriman.]

lady bracknell.  gwendolen!  what does this mean?

gwendolen.  merely that i am engaged to be married to mr. worthing, mamma.

lady bracknell.  come here.  sit down.  sit down immediately.  hesitation of any kind is a sign of mental decay in the young, of physical weakness in the old.  [turns to jack.]
