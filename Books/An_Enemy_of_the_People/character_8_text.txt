ann. aren't you a little nervous about that?

dr. stockmann. oh, he really will be pleased enough, you know. but, at the same time, peter is so confoundedly afraid of anyone's doing any service to the town except himself.

mrs. stockmann. i will tell you what, thomas—you should be good natured, and share the credit of this with him. couldn't you make out that it was he who set you on the scent of this discovery?

dr. stockmann. i am quite willing. if only i can get the thing set right. i—

(morten kiil puts his head in through the door leading from the hall, looks around in an enquiring manner, and chuckles.)

morten kiil (slyly). is it—is it true?

mrs. stockmann (going to the door). father!—is it you?

dr. stockmann. ah, mr. kiil—good morning, good morning!

mrs. stockmann. but come along in.

morten kiil. if it is true, i will; if not, i am off.

dr. stockmann. if what is true?

morten kiil. this tale about the water supply, is it true?

dr. stockmann. certainly it is true, but how d

id you come to hear it?

morten kid (coming in). petra ran in on her way to the school—

dr. stockmann. did she?

morten kiil. yes; and she declares that—i thought she was only making a fool of me—but it isn't like petra to do that.

dr. stockmann. of course not. how could you imagine such a thing!

morten kiil. oh well, it is better never to trust anybody; you may find you have been made a fool of before you know where you are. but it is really true, all the same?

dr. stockmann. you can depend upon it that it is true. won't you sit down? (settles him on the couch.) isn't it a real bit of luck for the town—

morten kiil (suppressing his laughter). a bit of luck for the town?

dr. stockmann. yes, that i made the discovery in good time.

morten kiil (as before). yes, yes, yes!—but i should never ha

ve thought you the sort of man to pull your own brother's leg like this!

dr. stockmann. pull his leg!

mrs. stockmann. really, father dear—

morten kiil (resting his hands and his chin on the handle of his stick and winking slyly at the doctor). let me see, what was the story? some kind of beast that had got into the water-pipes, wasn't it?

dr. stockmann. infusoria—yes.

morten kiil. and a lot of these beasts had got in, according to petra—a tremendous lot.

dr. stockmann. certainly; hundreds of thousands of them, probably.

morten kiil. but no one can see them—isn't that so?

dr. stockmann. yes; you can't see them,

morten kiil (with a quiet chuckle). damn—it's the finest story i have ever heard!

dr. stockmann. what do you mean?

morten kiil. but you will never get the mayor to believe a thing like that.

dr. stockmann. we shall see.

morten kiil. do you think he w

ill be fool enough to—?

dr. stockmann. i hope the whole town will be fools enough.

morten kiil. the whole town! well, it wouldn't be a bad thing. it would just serve them right, and teach them a lesson. they think themselves so much cleverer than we old fellows. they hounded me out of the council; they did, i tell you—they hounded me out. now they shall pay for it. you pull their legs too, thomas!

dr. stockmann. really, i—

morten kiil. you pull their legs! (gets up.) if you can work it so that the mayor and his friends all swallow the same bait, i will give ten pounds to a charity—like a shot!

dr. stockmann. that is very kind of you.

morten kiil. yes, i haven't got much money to throw away, i can tell you; but, if you can work this, i will give five pounds to a charity at christmas.

(hovstad comes in by the hall door.)

hovstad. good morning! (stops.) oh, i beg your pardon

dr. stockmann. not at all; come in.

hovstad. what do you mean?

dr. stockmann. certainly he is.

morten kiil. i might have known it! it must get into the papers. you know how to do it, thomas! set your wits to work. now i must go.

dr. stockmann. won't you stay a little while?

morten kiil. no, i must be off now. you keep up this game for all it is worth; you won't repent it, i'm damned if you will!

(he goes out; mrs. stockmann follows him into the hall.)

dr. stockmann (laughing). just imagine—the old chap doesn't believe a word of all this about the water supply.

hovstad. oh that was it, then?

dr. stockmann. yes, that was what we were talking about. perhaps it is the same thing that brings you here?

hovstad. yes, it is, can you spare me a few minutes, doctor?

billing. oughtn't we to try and get rid of him, hovstad?

hovstad. do you know anyone else who will advance the money for our paper and printing bill?

billing. it is an infernal nuisance that we don't possess some capital to trade on.

hovstad (sitting down at his desk). yes, if we only had that, then—

billing. suppose you were to apply to dr. stockmann?

hovstad (turning over some papers). what is the use? he has got nothing.

billing. no, but he has got a warm man in the background, old morten kiil—"the badger," as they call him.

hovstad (writing). are you so sure he has got anything?

billing. good lord, of course he has! and some of it must come to the stockmanns. most probably he will do something for the children, at all events.

hovstad (turning half round). are you counting on that?

billing. counting on it? of course i am not counting on anything.

hovstad. that is right. and i should not count on the secretaryship to the bench either, if i were you; for i can assure you—you w

others. he is drunk! turn him out! (they turn him out.)

dr. stockmann. am i allowed to speak?

aslaksen (ringing his bell). dr. stockmann will address the meeting.

dr. stockmann. i should like to have seen anyone, a few days ago, dare to attempt to silence me as has been done tonight! i would have defended my sacred rights as a man, like a lion! but now it is all one to me; i have something of even weightier importance to say to you. (the crowd presses nearer to him, morten kiil conspicuous among them.)

dr. stockmann (continuing). i have thought and pondered a great deal, these last few days—pondered over such a variety of things that in the end my head seemed too full to hold them—

peter stockmann (with a cough). ahem!

dr. stockmann. —but i got them clear in my mind at last, and then i saw the whole situation lucidly. and that is why i am standing here to-night. i have a great revelation to make to you, my fellow-citizens! i will impart to you a discovery of

billing. i shouldn't wonder if there were.

4th citizen. no, it is nothing more than sheer malice; he wants to get even with somebody for something or other.

billing. well certainly he suggested a rise in his salary on one occasion lately, and did not get it.

the citizens (together). ah!—then it is easy to understand how it is!

the drunken man (who has got among the audience again). i want a blue one, i do! and i want a white one too!

voices. it's that drunken chap again! turn him out!

morten kiil. (going up to dr. stockmann). well, stockmann, do you see what these monkey tricks of yours lead to?

dr. stockmann. i have done my duty.

morten kiil. what was that you said about the tanneries at molledal?

dr. stockmann. you heard well enough. i said they were the source of all the filth.

morten kiil. my tannery too?

dr. stockmann. unfortunately your tannery is by far the worst.

morten kiil. are you going to put that in the papers?

dr. stockmann. i shall conceal nothing.

dismissal is irrevocable—we have a weapon against you now. (goes out.)

dr. stockmann. for shame! for shame! (calls out.) katherine, you must have the floor scrubbed after him! let—what's her name—devil take it, the girl who has always got soot on her nose—

mrs. stockmann. (in the sitting-room). hush, thomas, be quiet!

petra (coming to the door). father, grandfather is here, asking if he may speak to you alone.

dr. stockmann. certainly he may. (going to the door.) come in, mr. kiil. (morten kiil comes in. dr. stockmann shuts the door after him.) what can i do for you? won't you sit down?

morten kiil. i won't sit. (looks around.) you look very comfortable here today, thomas.

dr. stockmann. yes, don't we!

morten kiil. very comfortable—plenty of fresh air. i should think you have got enough to-day of that oxygen you were talking about yesterday. your conscience must be in splendid order to-day, i should think.

dr. stockmann. it is.

morten kiil. so i should think. (taps his chest.)

do you know what i have got here?

dr. stockmann. a good conscience, too, i hope.

morten kiil. bah!—no, it is something better than that. (he takes a thick pocket-book from his breast-pocket, opens it, and displays a packet of papers.)

dr. stockmann (looking at him in astonishment). shares in the baths?

morten kiil. they were not difficult to get today.

dr. stockmann. and you have been buying—?

morten kiil. as many as i could pay for.

dr. stockmann. but, my dear mr. kiil—consider the state of the baths' affairs!

morten kiil. if you behave like a reasonable man, you can soon set the baths on their feet again.

dr. stockmann. well, you can see for yourself that i have done all i can, but—. they are all mad in this town!

morten kiil. you said yesterday that the worst of this pollution came from my tannery. if that is true, then my grandfather and my father before me, and i myself, for many ye

ars past, have been poisoning the town like three destroying angels. do you think i am going to sit quiet under that reproach?

dr. stockmann. unfortunately i am afraid you will have to.

morten kiil. no, thank you. i am jealous of my name and reputation. they call me "the badger," i am told. a badger is a kind of pig, i believe; but i am not going to give them the right to call me that. i mean to live and die a clean man.

dr. stockmann. and how are you going to set about it?

morten kiil. you shall cleanse me, thomas.

dr. stockmann. i!

morten kiil. do you know what money i have bought these shares with? no, of course you can't know—but i will tell you. it is the money that katherine and petra and the boys will have when i am gone. because i have been able to save a little bit after all, you know.

dr. stockmann (flaring up). and you have gone and taken katherine's money for this!

morten kiil. yes, the whole of the money is invested in the baths now. and now i just want to

see whether you are quite stark, staring mad, thomas! if you still make out that these animals and other nasty things of that sort come from my tannery, it will be exactly as if you were to flay broad strips of skin from katherine's body, and petra's, and the boys'; and no decent man would do that—unless he were mad.

dr. stockmann (walking up and down). yes, but i am mad; i am mad!

morten kiil. you cannot be so absurdly mad as all that, when it is a question of your wife and children.

dr. stockmann (standing still in front of him). why couldn't you consult me about it, before you went and bought all that trash?

morten kiil. what is done cannot be undone.

dr. stockmann (walks about uneasily). if only i were not so certain about it—! but i am absolutely convinced that i am right.

morten kiil (weighing the pocket-book in his hand). if you stick to your mad idea, this won't be wort

dr. stockmann. but, hang it all! it might be possible for science to discover some prophylactic, i should think—or some antidote of some kind—

morten kiil. to kill these animals, do you mean?

dr. stockmann. yes, or to make them innocuous.

morten kiil. couldn't you try some rat's-bane?

dr. stockmann. don't talk nonsense! they all say it is only imagination, you know. well, let it go at that! let them have their own way about it! haven't the ignorant, narrow-minded curs reviled me as an enemy of the people?—and haven't they been ready to tear the clothes off my back too?

morten kiil. and broken all your windows to pieces!

dr. stockmann. and then there is my duty to my family. i must talk it over with katherine; she is great on those thin

morten kiil. that is right; be guided by a reasonable woman's advice.

dr. stockmann (advancing towards him). to think you could do such a preposterous thing! risking katherine's money in this way, and putting me in such a horribly painful dilemma! when i look at you, i think i see the devil himself—.

morten kiil. then i had better go. but i must have an answer from you before two o'clock—yes or no. if it is no, the shares go to a charity, and that this very day.

dr. stockmann. and what does katherine get?

morten kiil. not a halfpenny. (the door leading to the hall opens, and hovstad and aslaksen make their appearance.) look at those two!

dr. stockmann (staring at them). what the devil!—have you actually the face to come into my house?

hovstad. certainly.

dr. stockmann. well, what do you want with me? be brief.

hovstad. i can quite understand that you are annoyed with us for our attitude at the meeting yesterday.

dr. stockmann. attitude, do you call it? yes, it was a charming attitude! i call it weak, womanish—damnably shameful!

hovstad. call it what you like, we could not do otherwise.

dr. stockmann. you dared not do otherwise—isn't that it?

hovstad. well, if you like to put it that way.
