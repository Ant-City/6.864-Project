ooked like an exercise boy from a racing stable.
his face was completely covered with a fine mesh of wrinkles, as though
he had been sleeping with it pressed against a roll of rabbit wire. he
was very shabby and had probably sold his big hat, but he still had his
boots.

"lo, boys," he said.

"lo, hink," said the man with the paper valise.

tod didn't know whether he was included in the greeting, but took a
chance and replied.

"howdy."

hink prodded the valise with his toe.

"coin' some place, calvin?" he asked.

"azusa, there's a rodeo."

"who's running it?"

"a fellow calls himself 'badlands jack.'"

"that grifter!...you goin', earle?"

"nope."

"i gotta eat," said calvin.

hink carefully considered all the information he had received before
speaking again.

"mono's makin' a new buck stevens," he said. "will ferris told me they'd
use more than forty riders."

calvin turned and looked up at earle.

"still got the piebald vest?" he asked slyly.

"why?"

"it'll cinch you a job as a road agen

t."

tod understood that this was a joke of some sort because calvin and hink
chuckled and slapped their thighs loudly while earle frowned.

there was another long silence, then calvin spoke again. "ain't your old
man still got some cows?" he asked earle. but earle was wary this time
and refused to answer. calvin winked at tod, slowly and elaborately,
contorting one whole side of his face.

"that's right, earle," hink said. "your old man's still got some stock.
why don't you go home?"

they couldn't get a rise out of earle, so calvin answered the question.

"he dassint. he got caught in a sheep car with a pair of rubber boots on."

it was another joke. calvin and hink slapped their thighs and laughed,
but tod could see that they were waiting for something else. earle,
suddenly, without even shifting his

 weight, shot his foot out and kicked
calvin solidly in the rump. this was the real point of the joke. they
were delighted by earle's fury. tod also laughed. the way earle had gone
from apathy to action without the usual transition was funny. the
seriousness of his violence was even funnier.

a little while later, faye drove by in her battered ford touring car and
pulled into the curb some twenty feet away. calvin and hink waved, but
earle didn't budge. he took his time, as befitted his dignity. not until
she tooted her horn did he move. tod followed a short distance behind
him.

"hi, cowboy," said faye gaily.

"lo, honey," he drawled, removing his hat carefully and replacing it with
even greater care. faye smiled at tod and motioned for them both to climb
in. tod got in the back. earle unfolded the jacket he was carrying,
slapped it a few times to remove the wrinkles, then put it on and
adjusted its col

hed his cigarette. he was hungry and wanted his dinner, also a
double scotch and soda. after he had eaten, he would come back and see
how homer was. if he was still asleep, he would try to wake him. if he
couldn't, he might call a doctor.

he took another look at him, then tiptoed out of the cottage, shutting
the door carefully.

tod didn't go directly to dinner. he went first to hodge's saddlery store
thinking he might be able to find out something about earle and through
him about faye. calvin was standing there with a wrinkled indian who had
long hair held by a bead strap around his forehead. hanging over the
indian's chest was a sandwich board that read--

tuttle's trading post
for
genuine relics of the old west
beads, silver, jewelry, moccasins,
dolls, toys, rare books, postcards.
take back a souvenir
from
tuttle's trading post

calvin was always friendly.

"'lo, char," he called out, when tod came up.

"meet the chief," he added, grinning. "chief kiss-my-towkus."

the indian laug

hed heartily at the joke.

"you gotta live," he said.

"earle been around today?" tod asked.

"yop. went by an hour ago."

"we were at a party last night and i..."

calvin broke in by hitting his thigh a wallop with the flat of his palm.

"that must've been some shindig to hear earle tell it. eh, skookum?"

"vas you dere, sharley?" the indian agreed, showing the black inside of
his mouth, purple tongue and broken orange teeth.

"i heard there was a fight after i left."

calvin smacked his thigh again.

"sure musta been. earle get himself two black eyes,

"that's what comes of palling up with a dirty greaser," said the indian
excitedly.

he and calvin got into a long argument about mexicans. the indian said
that they were all bad. calvin claimed he had known quite a few good ones
in his time. when the indian cited the case of the hermanos brothers who
had killed a lonely prospector for half a dollar, calvin countered with a
long tale about a man called tomas lopez who

 shared his last pint of
water with a stranger when they both were lost in the desert.

tod tried to get the conversation back to what interested him.

"mexicans are very good with women," he said.

"better with horses," said the indian. "i remember one time along the
brazos, i..."

tod tried again.

"they fought over earle's girl, didn't they?"

"not to hear him tell it," calvin said. "he claims it was dough--claims
the mex robbed him while he was sleeping."

"the dirty, thievin' rat," said the indian, spitting.

"he claims he's all washed up with that bitch," calvin went on.

"yes, siree, that's his story, to hear him tell it" tod had enough.

"so long," he said.

"glad to meet you," said the indian.

"don't take any wooden nickels," calvin shouted after him.

tod wondered if she had gone with miguel. he thought it more likely that
she would go back to work for mrs. j
