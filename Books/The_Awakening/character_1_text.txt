ced twice with her husband, once with
robert, and once with monsieur ratignolle, who was thin and tall and
swayed like a reed in the wind when he danced, she went out on the
gallery and seated herself on the low window-sill, where she commanded a
view of all that went on in the hall and could look out toward the gulf.
there was a soft effulgence in the east. the moon was coming up, and its
mystic shimmer was casting a million lights across the distant, restless
water.

â€œwould you like to hear mademoiselle reisz play?â€ asked robert, coming
out on the porch where she was. of course edna would like to hear
mademoiselle reisz play; but she feared it would be useless to entreat
her.

â€œiâ€™ll ask her,â€ he said. â€œiâ€™ll tell her that you want to hear her. she
likes you. she will come.â€ he turned and hurried away to one of the far
cottages, where mademoiselle reisz was shuffling away. she was dragging
a chair in and out of her room, and at intervals objecting to the crying
of a baby, which a nurse i

e would like to hear me play,â€ she requested
of robert. she sat perfectly still before the piano, not touching the
keys, while robert carried her message to edna at the window. a general
air of surprise and genuine satisfaction fell upon every one as they saw
the pianist enter. there was a settling down, and a prevailing air
of expectancy everywhere. edna was a trifle embarrassed at being thus
signaled out for the imperious little womanâ€™s favor. she would not dare
to choose, and begged that mademoiselle reisz would please herself in
her selections.

edna was what she herself called very fond of music. musical strains,
well rendered, had a way of evoking pictures in her mind. she sometimes
liked to sit in the room of mornings when madame ratignolle played
or practiced. one piece which that lady played edna had entitled
â€œsolitude.â€ it was a short, plaintive, minor strain. the name of the
piece was something else, but she called it â€œsolitude.â€ when she heard
it there came before her imagination

ure of a man standing beside
a desolate rock on the seashore. he was naked. his attitude was one
of hopeless resignation as he looked toward a distant bird winging its
flight away from him.

another piece called to her mind a dainty young woman clad in an empire
gown, taking mincing dancing steps as she came down a long avenue
between tall hedges. again, another reminded her of children at play,
and still another of nothing on earth but a demure lady stroking a cat.

the very first chords which mademoiselle reisz struck upon the piano
sent a keen tremor down mrs. pontellierâ€™s spinal column. it was not
the first time she had heard an artist at the piano. perhaps it was the
first time she was ready, perhaps the first time her being was tempered
to take an impress of the abiding truth.

she waited for the material pictures which she thought would gather and
blaze before her imagination. she waited in vain. she saw no pictures
of solitude, of hope, of longing, or of despair. but the very passions

es were aroused within her soul, swaying it, lashing it, as the
waves daily beat upon her splendid body. she trembled, she was choking,
and the tears blinded her.

mademoiselle had finished. she arose, and bowing her stiff, lofty bow,
she went away, stopping for neither thanks nor applause. as she passed
along the gallery she patted edna upon the shoulder.

â€œwell, how did you like my music?â€ she asked. the young woman was
unable to answer; she pressed the hand of the pianist convulsively.
mademoiselle reisz perceived her agitation and even her tears. she
patted her again upon the shoulder as she said:

â€œyou are the only one worth playing for. those others? bah!â€ and she
went shuffling and sidling on down the gallery toward her room.

but she was mistaken about â€œthose others.â€ her playing had aroused a
fever of enthusiasm. â€œwhat passion!â€ â€œwhat an artist!â€ â€œi have always
said no one could play chopin like mademoiselle reisz!â€ â€œthat last
prelude! bon dieu! it shakes a man!â€

â€œthought of what?â€

â€œof anything. what difference does it make?â€

â€œiâ€™m very tired,â€ she uttered, complainingly.

â€œi know you are.â€

â€œyou donâ€™t know anything about it. why should you know? i never was so
exhausted in my life. but it isnâ€™t unpleasant. a thousand emotions have
swept through me to-night. i donâ€™t comprehend half of them. donâ€™t mind
what iâ€™m saying; i am just thinking aloud. i wonder if i shall ever
be stirred again as mademoiselle reiszâ€™s playing moved me to-night. i
wonder if any night on earth will ever again be like this one. it is
like a night in a dream. the people about me are like some uncanny,
half-human beings. there must be spirits abroad to-night.â€

â€œthere are,â€ whispered robert, â€œdidnâ€™t you know this was the
twenty-eighth of august?â€

â€œthe twenty-eighth of august?â€

â€œyes. on the twenty-eighth of august, at the hour of midnight, and if
the moon is shining--the moon must be shining--a spirit that

doing then with the biting conviction that she had lost that which she
had held, that she had been denied that which her impassioned, newly

â€œdo you miss your friend greatly?â€ asked mademoiselle reisz one morning
as she came creeping up behind edna, who had just left her cottage on
her way to the beach. she spent much of her time in the water since she
had acquired finally the art of swimming. as their stay at grand isle
drew near its close, she felt that she could not give too much time to a
diversion which afforded her the only real pleasurable moments that she
knew. when mademoiselle reisz came and touched her upon the shoulder
and spoke to her, the woman seemed to echo the thought which

 wouldnâ€™t give myself. i canâ€™t make it more
clear; itâ€™s only something which i am beginning to comprehend, which is
revealing itself to me.â€

â€œi donâ€™t know what you would call the essential, or what you mean by the
unessential,â€ said madame ratignolle, cheerfully; â€œbut a woman who would
give her life for her children could do no more than that--your bible
tells you so. iâ€™m sure i couldnâ€™t do more than that.â€

â€œoh, yes you could!â€ laughed edna.

she was not surprised at mademoiselle reiszâ€™s question the morning that
lady, following her to the beach, tapped her on the shoulder and asked
if she did not greatly miss her young friend.

â€œoh, good morning, mademoiselle; is it you? why, of course i miss
robert. are you going down to bathe?â€

â€œwhy should i go down to bathe at the very end of the season when i
havenâ€™t been in the surf all summer,â€ replied the woman, disagreeably.

â€œi beg your pardon,â€ offered edna, in some embarrassment, for she should
have remembered tha

t mademoiselle reiszâ€™s avoidance of the water had
furnished a theme for much pleasantry. some among them thought it was
on account of her false hair, or the dread of getting the violets wet,
while others attributed it to the natural aversion for water sometimes
believed to accompany the artistic temperament. mademoiselle offered
edna some chocolates in a paper bag, which she took from her pocket,
by way of showing that she bore no ill feeling. she habitually ate
chocolates for their sustaining quality; they conta

walking with her, or bathing with her, or carrying her basket--i donâ€™t

him a thrashing on the spot that has kept him comparatively in order for
a good while. itâ€™s about time he was getting another.â€

â€œwas her name mariequita?â€ asked edna.

â€œmariequita--yes, that was it; mariequita. i had forgotten. oh, sheâ€™s a
sly one, and a bad one, that mariequita!â€

edna looked down at mademoiselle reisz and wondered how she could have
listened to her venom so long. for some reason she felt depressed,
almost unhappy. she had not intended to go into the water; but she
donned her bathing suit, and left mademoiselle alone, seated under the
shade of the childrenâ€™s tent. the water was growing cooler as the season
advanced. edna plunged and swam about with an abandon that thrilled and
invigorated her. she remained a long time in the water, half hoping that
mademoiselle reisz would not wait for her.

ademoiselle waited. she was very amiable during the walk back, and
raved much over ednaâ€™s appearance in her bathing suit. she talked about
music. she hoped that edna would go to see her in the city, and wrote
her address with the stub of a pencil on a piece of card which she found
in her pocket.

â€œwhen do you leave?â€ asked edna.

â€œnext monday; and you?â€

â€œthe following week,â€ answered edna, adding, â€œit has been a pleasant
summer, hasnâ€™t it, mademoiselle?â€

â€œwell,â€ agreed mademoiselle reisz, with a shrug, â€œrather pleasant, if it
hadnâ€™t been for the mosquitoes and the farival twins.â€

the pontelliers possessed a very charming home on esplanade street in
new orleans. it was a large, double cottage, with a broad front veranda,
whose round, fluted columns supported the sloping roof. the house was
painted a dazzling white; the outside shutters, or jalousies, were
green. in the yard, which was kept scrupulously neat, were flowers and
plants of every description which flo

to dream in. and she found it good to dream and to be alone and
unmolested.

there were days when she was unhappy, she did not know why,--when it did
not seem worth while to be glad or sorry, to be alive or dead; when life
appeared to her like a grotesque pandemonium and humanity like worms
struggling blindly toward inevitable annihilation. she could not work on
such a day, nor weave fancies to stir her pulses and warm her blood.




xx


it was during such a mood that edna hunted up mademoiselle reisz. she
had not forgotten the rather disagreeable impression left upon her
by their last interview; but she nevertheless felt a desire to see
her--above all, to listen while she played upon the piano. quite
early in the afternoon she started upon her quest for the pianist.
unfortunately she had mislaid or lost mademoiselle reiszâ€™s card, and
looking up her address in the city directory, she found that the woman
lived on bienville street, some distance away. the directory which fell
into her hands

 was a year or more old, however, and upon reaching the
number indicated, edna discovered that the house was occupied by a
respectable family of mulattoes who had chambres garnies to let. they
had been living there for six months, and knew absolutely nothing of
a mademoiselle reisz. in fact, they knew nothing of any of their
neighbors; their lodgers were all people of the highest distinction,
they assured edna. she did not linger to discuss class distinctions with
madame pouponne, but hastened to a neighboring grocery store, feeling
sure that mademoiselle would have left her address with the proprietor.

he knew mademoiselle reisz a good deal better than he wanted to know
her, he informed his questioner. in truth, he did not want to know her
at all, or anything concerning

 her--the most disagreeable and unpopular
woman who ever lived in bienville street. he thanked heaven she had left
the neighborhood, and was equally thankful that he did not know where
she had gone.

ednaâ€™s desire to see mademoiselle reisz had increased tenfold since
these unlooked-for obstacles had arisen to thwart it. she was wondering
who could give her the information she sought, when it suddenly occurred
to her that madame lebrun would be the one most likely to do so. she
knew it was useless to ask madame ratignolle, who was on the most
distant terms with the musician, and preferred to know nothing
concerning her. she had once been almost as emphatic in expressing
herself upon the subject as the corner grocer.

edna knew tha

he city of mexico, the buildings, the people and
their habits, the conditions of life which he found there. he sent his
love to the family. he inclosed a check to his mother, and hoped she
would affectionately remember him to all his friends. that was about the
substance of the two letters. edna felt that if there had been a message
for her, she would have received it. the despondent frame of mind in
which she had left home began again to overtake her, and she remembered
that she wished to find mademoiselle reisz.

madame lebrun knew where mademoiselle reisz lived. she gave edna the
address, regretting that she would not consent to stay and spend the
remainder of the afternoon, and pay a visit to mademoiselle reisz some
other day. the afternoon was already well advanced.

victor escorted her out upon the banquette, lifted her parasol, and held
it over her while he walked to the car with her. he entreated her
to bear in mind that the disclosures of the afternoon were strictly
confidential. she laughed an

late that she should have been dignified and reserved.

â€œhow handsome mrs. pontellier looked!â€ said madame lebrun to her son.

way she doesnâ€™t seem like the same woman.â€

some people contended that the reason mademoiselle reisz always chose
apartments up under the roof was to discourage the approach of beggars,
peddlars and callers. there were plenty of windows in her little front
room. they were for the most part dingy, but as they were nearly always
open it did not make so much difference. they often admitted into the
room a good deal of smoke and soot; but at the same time all the light
and air that there was came through them. from her windows could be seen
the crescent of the river, the masts of ships and the big

 chimneys of
the mississippi steamers. a magnificent piano crowded the apartment.
in the next room she slept, and in the third and last she harbored a
gasoline stove on which she cooked her meals when disinclined to descend
to the neighboring restaurant. it was there also that she ate, keeping
her belongings in a rare old buffet, dingy and battered from a hundred
years of use.

when edna knocked at mademoiselle reiszâ€™s front room door and entered,
she discovered that person standing beside the window, engaged in
mending or patching an old prunella gaiter. the little musician laughed
all over when she saw edna. her laugh consisted of a contortion of the
face and all the muscles of the body. she seemed strikingly homely,
standing there in the afternoon light. she still wore the shabby lace
and the artificial bunch of violets on the side of her head.

â€œso you remembered me at last,â€ said mademoiselle. â€

directed toward successful achievement.

before her pencil he sat rigid and unflinching, as he had faced the
cannonâ€™s mouth in days gone by. he resented the intrusion of the
children, who gaped with wondering eyes at him, sitting so stiff up
there in their motherâ€™s bright atelier. when they drew near he motioned
them away with an expressive action of the foot, loath to disturb the
fixed lines of his countenance, his arms, or his rigid shoulders.

edna, anxious to entertain him, invited mademoiselle reisz to meet
him, having promised him a treat in her piano playing; but mademoiselle
declined the invitation. so together they attended a soiree musicale
at the ratignollesâ€™. monsieur and madame ratignolle made much of the
colonel, installing him as the guest of honor and engaging him at
once to dine with them the following sunday, or any day which he might
select. madame coquetted with him in the most captivating and naive
manner, with eyes, gestures, and a profusion of compliments, till the

ving the house to attend the
meeting of a branch folk lore society, and regretted that she could not
accompany them. arobin appeared nonplused, and asked edna if there were
any one else she cared to ask.

she did not deem it worth while to go in search of any of the
fashionable acquaintances from whom she had withdrawn herself. she
thought of madame ratignolle, but knew that her fair friend did not
leave the house, except to take a languid walk around the block with her
husband after nightfall. mademoiselle reisz would have laughed at such a
request from edna. madame lebrun might have enjoyed the outing, but for
some reason edna did not want her. so they went alone, she and arobin.

the afternoon was intensely interesting to her. the excitement came
back upon her like a remittent fever. her talk grew familiar and
confidential. it was no labor to become intimate with arobin. his manner
invited easy confidence. the preliminary stage of becoming acquainted
was one which he always endeavored to ignore when

adoration. he was ready at all times to submit to her moods, which were
as often kind as they were cold. she grew accustomed to him. they became
intimate and friendly by imperceptible degrees, and then by leaps. he
sometimes talked in a way that astonished her at first and brought the
crimson into her face; in a way that pleased her at last, appealing to
the animalism that stirred impatiently within her.

there was nothing which so quieted the turmoil of ednaâ€™s senses as
a visit to mademoiselle reisz. it was then, in the presence of that
personality which was offensive to her, that the woman, by her divine
art, seemed to reach ednaâ€™s spirit and set it free.

it was misty, with heavy, lowering atmosphere, one afternoon, when
edna climbed the stairs to the pianistâ€™s apartments under the roof. her
clothes were dripping with moisture. she felt chilled and pinched as she
entered the room. mademoiselle was poking at a rusty stove that smoked a
little and warmed the room indifferently. she was

â€œyou are purposely misunderstanding me, ma reine. are you in love with

â€œyes,â€ said edna. it was the first time she had admitted it, and a glow
overspread her face, blotching it with red spots.

â€œwhy?â€ asked her companion. â€œwhy do you love him when you ought not to?â€

edna, with a motion or two, dragged herself on her knees before
mademoiselle reisz, who took the glowing face between her two hands.

â€œwhy? because his hair is brown and grows away from his temples; because
he opens and shuts his eyes, and his nose is a little out of drawing;
because he has two lips and a square chin, and a little finger which he
canâ€™t straighten from having played baseball too energetically in his
youth. because--â€

â€œbecause you do, in short,â€ laughed mademoiselle. â€œwhat will you do when

captivating. spare yourself the effort.â€

â€œno; i shanâ€™t tell you anything of the sort, though i shouldnâ€™t be lying
if i did.â€

â€œdo you know mademoiselle reisz?â€ she asked irrelevantly.

â€œthe pianist? i know her by sight. iâ€™ve heard her play.â€

â€œshe says queer things sometimes in a bantering way that you donâ€™t
notice at the time and you find yourself thinking about afterward.â€

unpresentable, and not foreseeing that madame lebrun
would send a thousand regrets at the last moment. so there were only
ten, after all, which made a cozy, comfortable number.

there were mr. and mrs. merriman, a pretty, vivacious little woman in
the thirties; her husband, a jovial fellow, something of a shallow-pate,
who laughed a good deal at other peopleâ€™s witticisms, and had thereby
made himself extremely popular. mrs. highcamp had accompanied them. of
course, there was alcee arobin; and mademoiselle reisz had consented
to come. edna had sent her a fresh bunch of violets with black lace
trimmings for her hair. monsieur ratignolle brought himself and his
wifeâ€™s excuses. victor lebrun, who happened to be in the city, bent upon
relaxation, had accepted with alacrity. there was a miss mayblunt, no
longer in her teens, who looked at the world through lorgnettes and with
the keenest interest. it was thought and said that she was intellectual;
it was suspected of her that she wrote under a nom de guer

onveyed by a cover of pale yellow satin
under strips of lace-work. there were wax candles, in massive brass
candelabra, burning softly under yellow silk shades; full, fragrant
roses, yellow and red, abounded. there were silver and gold, as she had
said there would be, and crystal which glittered like the gems which the
women wore.

the ordinary stiff dining chairs had been discarded for the occasion and
replaced by the most commodious and luxurious which could be collected
throughout the house. mademoiselle reisz, being exceedingly diminutive,
was elevated upon cushions, as small children are sometimes hoisted at
table upon bulky volumes.

â€œsomething new, edna?â€ exclaimed miss mayblunt, with lorgnette directed
toward a magnificent cluster of diamonds that sparkled, that almost
sputtered, in ednaâ€™s hair, just over the center of her forehead.

â€œthere are so many inquisitive people and institutions abounding,â€ said
arobin, â€œthat one is really forced as a matter of convenience these
days to assume the virtue of an occupation if he has it not.â€ monsieur
ratignolle stared a little, and turned to ask mademoiselle reisz if she
considered the symphony concerts up to the standard which had been set
the previous winter. mademoiselle reisz answered monsieur ratignolle in
french, which edna thought a little rude, under the circumstances, but
characteristic. mademoiselle had only disagreeable things to say of the
symphony concerts, and insulting remarks to make of all the musicians
of new orleans, singly and collectively. all her interest seemed to be
centered upon the delicacies placed before her.

the moments glided on, while a feeling of good fellowship passed around
the circle like a mystic cord, holding and binding these people together
with jest and laughter. monsieur ratignolle was the first to break the
pleasant charm. at ten oâ€™clock he excused himself. madame ratignolle
was waiting for him at home. she was bien souffrante, and she was filled
with vague dread, which only her husbandâ€™s presence could allay.

mademoiselle reisz arose with monsieur ratignolle, who offered to escort
her to the car. she had eaten well; she had tasted the good, rich wines,
and they must have turned her head, for she bowed pleasantly to all
as she withdrew from table. she kissed edna upon the shoulder, and
whispered: â€œbonne nuit, ma reine; soyez sage.â€ she had been a little
bewildered upon rising, or rather, descending from her cushions, and
monsieur ratignolle gallantly took her arm and led her away.

a dismantled condition. it gave her the
promise and pretext to keep the children indefinitely.

it was with a wrench and a pang that edna left her children. she carried
away with her the sound of their voices and the touch of their cheeks.
all along the journey homeward their presence lingered with her like the
memory of a delicious song. but by the time she had regained the city
the song no longer echoed in her soul. she was again alone.

it happened sometimes when edna went to see mademoiselle reisz that
the little musician was absent, giving a lesson or making some small
necessary household purchase. the key was always left in a secret
hiding-place in the entry, which edna knew. if mademoiselle happened to
be away, edna would usually enter and wait for her return.

when she knocked at mademoiselle reiszâ€™s door one afternoon there was
no response; so unlocking the door, as usual, she entered and found the
apartment deserted, as she had expected. her day had been quite filled
up, and it w

her when her hour of trial overtook her.

â€œat any time--any time of the day or night, dear,â€ edna assured her.

before leaving madame ratignolle said:

â€œin some way you seem to me like a child, edna. you seem to act without
a certain amount of reflection which is necessary in this life. that is
the reason i want to say you mustnâ€™t mind if i advise you to be a little
careful while you are living here alone. why donâ€™t you have some one
come and stay with you? wouldnâ€™t mademoiselle reisz come?â€

â€œno; she wouldnâ€™t wish to come, and i shouldnâ€™t want her always with
me.â€

â€œwell, the reason--you know how evil-minded the world is--some one was
talking of alcee arobin visiting you. of course, it wouldnâ€™t matter if
mr. arobin had not such a dreadful reputation. monsieur ratignolle was
telling me that his attentions alone are considered enough to ruin a
womanâ€™s name.â€

â€œdoes he boast of his successes?â€ asked edna, indifferently, squinting
at her picture.

â€œno, i

er walk down the street.

then in the afternoon mrs. merriman and mrs. highcamp had made their
â€œparty call.â€ edna felt that they might have dispensed with the
formality. they had also come to invite her to play vingt-et-un one
evening at mrs. merrimanâ€™s. she was asked to go early, to dinner, and
mr. merriman or mr. arobin would take her home. edna accepted in a
half-hearted way. she sometimes felt very tired of mrs. highcamp and
mrs. merriman.

late in the afternoon she sought refuge with mademoiselle reisz, and
stayed there alone, waiting for her, feeling a kind of repose invade her
with the very atmosphere of the shabby, unpretentious little room.

edna sat at the window, which looked out over the house-tops and across
the river. the window frame was filled with pots of flowers, and she sat
and picked the dry leaves from a rose geranium. the day was warm, and
the breeze which blew from the river was very pleasant. she removed her
hat and laid it on the piano. she went on picking the leaves and

igging around the plants with her hat pin. once she thought she heard
mademoiselle reisz approaching. but it was a young black girl, who
came in, bringing a small bundle of laundry, which she deposited in the
adjoining room, and went away.

edna seated herself at the piano, and softly picked out with one hand
the bars of a piece of music which lay open before her. a half-hour went
by. there was the occasional sound of people going and coming in the
lower hall. she was growing interested in her occupation of picking out
the aria, when there was a second rap at the door. she vaguely

they found mademoiselleâ€™s door locked.

â€œcome in,â€ she called, turning her face toward the door. and this time
it was robert lebrun who presented himself. she attempted to rise; she
could not have done so without betraying the agitation which mastered
her at sight of him, so she fell back upon the stool, only exclaiming,
â€œwhy, robert!â€

he came and clasped her hand, seemingly without knowing what he was
saying or doing.

â€œmrs. pontellier! how do you happen--oh! how well you look! is
mademoiselle reisz not here? i never expected to see you.â€

â€œwhen did you come back?â€ asked edna in an unsteady voice, wiping her
face with her handkerchief. she seemed ill at ease on the piano stool,
and he begged her to take the chair by the window.

she did so, mechanically, while he seated himself on the stool.

â€œi returned day before yesterday,â€ he answered, while he leaned his arm
on the keys, bringing forth a crash of discordant sound.

â€œday before yesterday!â€ she repeated, aloud; and went on

hem.

a hundred times edna had pictured robertâ€™s return, and imagined their
first meeting. it was usually at her home, whither he had sought her out
at once. she always fancied him expressing or betraying in some way his
love for her. and here, the reality was that they sat ten feet apart,
she at the window, crushing geranium leaves in her hand and smelling
them, he twirling around on the piano stool, saying:

â€œi was very much surprised to hear of mr. pontellierâ€™s absence; itâ€™s a
wonder mademoiselle reisz did not tell me; and your moving--mother told
me yesterday. i should think you would have gone to new york with him,
or to iberville with the children, rather than be bothered here with
housekeeping. and you are going abroad, too, i hear. we shanâ€™t have
you at grand isle next summer; it wonâ€™t seem--do you see much of
mademoiselle reisz? she often spoke of you in the few letters she
wrote.â€

â€œdo you remember that you promised to write to me when you went away?â€ a
flush overspread his w

â€œi couldnâ€™t believe that my letters would be of any interest to you.â€

â€œthat is an excuse; it isnâ€™t the truth.â€ edna reached for her hat on the
piano. she adjusted it, sticking the hat pin through the heavy coil of
hair with some deliberation.

â€œare you not going to wait for mademoiselle reisz?â€ asked robert.

â€œno; i have found when she is absent this long, she is liable not to
come back till late.â€ she drew on her gloves, and robert picked up his
hat.

â€œwonâ€™t you wait for her?â€ asked edna.

â€œnot if you think she will not be back till late,â€ adding, as if
suddenly aware of some discourtesy in his speech, â€œand i should miss the
pleasure of walking home with you.â€ edna locked the door and put the key
back in its hiding-place.

they went together, picking their way a

d her good night.

â€œis that one of the things you always say to women?â€

â€œi have said it before, but i donâ€™t think i ever came so near meaning
it,â€ he answered with a smile. there were no warm lights in her eyes;
only a dreamy, absent look.

â€œgood night. i adore you. sleep well,â€ he said, and he kissed her hand
and went away.

she stayed alone in a kind of reverie--a sort of stupor. step by step
she lived over every instant of the time she had been with robert after
he had entered mademoiselle reiszâ€™s door. she recalled his words,
his looks. how few and meager they had been for her hungry heart! a
vision--a transcendently seductive vision of a mexican girl arose before
her. she writhed with a jealous pang. she wondered when he would come
back. he had not said he would come back. she had been with him, had
heard his voice and touched his hand. but some way he had seemed nearer
to her off there in mexico.

in paris.

she said possibly she might, and he negotiated with her for some
parisian studies to reach him in time for the holiday trade in december.

robert did not come that day. she was keenly disappointed. he did not
come the following day, nor the next. each morning she awoke with hope,
and each night she was a prey to despondency. she was tempted to seek
him out. but far from yielding to the impulse, she avoided any occasion
which might throw her in his way. she did not go to mademoiselle reiszâ€™s
nor pass by madame lebrunâ€™s, as she might have done if he had still been
in mexico.

when arobin, one night, urged her to drive with him, she went--out to
the lake, on the shell road. his horses were full of mettle, and even a
little unmanageable. she liked the rapid gait at which they spun along,
and the quick, sharp sound of the horsesâ€™ hoofs on the hard road. they
did not stop anywhere to eat or to drink. arobin was not needlessly
imprudent. but they ate and they drank when they rega

nd on. she remembered the night she swam far out, and
recalled the terror that seized her at the fear of being unable to
regain the shore. she did not look back now, but went on and on,
thinking of the blue-grass meadow that she had traversed when a little
child, believing that it had no beginning and no end.

her arms and legs were growing tired.

she thought of leonce and the children. they were a part of her life.
but they need not have thought that they could possess her, body and
soul. how mademoiselle reisz would have laughed, perhaps sneered, if she
knew! â€œand you call yourself an artist! what pretensions, madame! the
artist must possess the courageous soul that dares and defies.â€

exhaustion was pressing upon and overpowering her.

â€œgood-by--because i love you.â€ he did not know; he did not understand.
he would never understand. perhaps doctor mandelet would have understood
if she had seen him--but it was too late; the shore was far behind her,
and her strength was gone.

she looked into
