  beyond  the  fact  that  it
worked, neither he nor anyone else could give a compelling reason for why it should be true. as the
physicist george gamow once said, it was as if nature allowed one to drink a whole pint of beer or
no beer at all, but nothing in between.5 in 1905, einstein found an explanation and for this insight he
was awarded the 1921 nobel prize in physics.

einstein came up with his explanation by puzzling over something known as the photoelectric
effect. the german physicist heinrich hertz in 1887 was the first to find that when electromagnetic
radiation—light—shines  on  certain  metals,  they  emit  electrons.  by  itself  this  is  not  particularly
remarkable.  metals  have  the  property  that  some  of  their  electrons  are  only  loosely  bound  within
atoms (which is why they are such good conductors of electricity). when light strikes the metallic
surface it relinquishes its energy, much as it does when it strikes the surface of your skin, causing you
