_ant. e._ good signior angelo, you must excuse us all;
my wife is shrewish when i keep not hours:
say that i linger’d with you at your shop
to see the making of her carcanet,
and that to-morrow you will bring it home.                           5

he met me on the mart, and that i beat him,

or i’ll attach you by this officer.

_ang._ even just the sum that i do owe to you
is growing to me by antipholus;
and in the instant that i met with you
he had of me a chain: at five o’clock                               10
i shall receive the money for the same.
pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,
i will discharge my bond, and thank you too.

among my wife and her confederates,
for locking me out of my doors by day.--
