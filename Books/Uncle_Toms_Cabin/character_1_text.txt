patch, where, every summer, strawberries,
raspberries, and a variety of fruits and vegetables, flourished under
careful tending. the whole front of it was covered by a large
scarlet bignonia and a native multiflora rose, which, entwisting and
interlacing, left scarce a vestige of the rough logs to be seen. here,
also, in summer, various brilliant annuals, such as marigolds, petunias,
four-oâ€™clocks, found an indulgent corner in which to unfold their
splendors, and were the delight and pride of aunt chloeâ€™s heart.

let us enter the dwelling. the evening meal at the house is over, and
aunt chloe, who presided over its preparation as head cook, has left
to inferior officers in the kitchen the business of clearing away and
washing dishes, and come out into her own snug territories, to â€œget her
ole manâ€™s supperâ€; therefore, doubt not that it is her you see by the
fire, presiding with anxious interest over certain frizzling items in
a stew-pan, and anon with grave consideration lifting the co

â€œsomething good.â€ a round, black, shining face is hers, so glossy as
to suggest the idea that she might have been washed over with white of
eggs, like one of her own tea rusks. her whole plump countenance beams
with satisfaction and contentment from under her well-starched checked
turban, bearing on it, however, if we must confess it, a little of
that tinge of self-consciousness which becomes the first cook of the
neighborhood, as aunt chloe was universally held and acknowledged to be.

a cook she certainly was, in the very bone and centre of her soul. not
a chicken or turkey or duck in the barn-yard but looked grave when they
saw her approaching, and seemed evidently to be reflecting on their
latter end; and certain it was that she was always meditating on
trussing, stuffing and roasting, to a degree that was calculated to
inspire terror in any reflecting fowl living. her corn-cake, in all its
varieties of hoe-cake, dodgers, muffi

she would shake her fat sides with honest pride and merriment, as she
would narrate the fruitless efforts that one and another of her compeers
had made to attain to her elevation.

the arrival of company at the house, the arranging of dinners and
suppers â€œin style,â€ awoke all the energies of her soul; and no sight
was more welcome to her than a pile of travelling trunks launched on the
verandah, for then she foresaw fresh efforts and fresh triumphs.

just at present, however, aunt chloe is looking into the bake-pan; in
which congenial operation we shall leave her till we finish our picture
of the cottage.

in one corner of it stood a bed, covered neatly with a snowy spread; and
by the side of it was a piece of carpeting, of some considerable size.
on this piece of carpeting aunt chloe took her stand, as being decidedly
in the upper walks of life; and it and the bed by which it lay, and the
whole corner, in fact, were treated with distinguished consideration,
and made, so far a

â€œnot that way, uncle tom,--not that way,â€ said he, briskly, as uncle
tom laboriously brought up the tail of his _g_ the wrong side out; â€œthat
makes a _q_, you see.â€

â€œla sakes, now, does it?â€ said uncle tom, looking with a respectful,
admiring air, as his young teacher flourishingly scrawled _q_â€™s and
_g_â€™s innumerable for his edification; and then, taking the pencil in
his big, heavy fingers, he patiently recommenced.

â€œhow easy white folks alâ€™us does things!â€ said aunt chloe, pausing
while she was greasing a griddle with a scrap of bacon on her fork, and
regarding young master george with pride. â€œthe way he can write, now!
and read, too! and then to come out here evenings and read his lessons
to us,--itâ€™s mighty interestinâ€™!â€

â€œbut, aunt chloe, iâ€™m getting mighty hungry,â€ said george. â€œisnâ€™t that
cake in the skillet almost done?â€

â€œmose done, masâ€™r george,â€ said aunt chloe, lifting the lid and peeping
in,--â€œbrowning beautiful--a real lov

now, to see good vittles spilt dat ar way! cake ris all to one side--no
shape at all; no more than my shoe; go way!â€

and with this final expression of contempt for sallyâ€™s greenness, aunt
chloe whipped the cover off the bake-kettle, and disclosed to view a
neatly-baked pound-cake, of which no city confectioner need to have been
ashamed. this being evidently the central point of the entertainment,
aunt chloe began now to bustle about earnestly in the supper department.

â€œhere you, mose and pete! get out de way, you niggers! get away,
polly, honey,--mammyâ€™ll give her baby some fin, by and by. now, masâ€™r
george, you jest take off dem books, and set down now with my old man,

for you. o, let you alone for dat! go way!â€ and, with that, aunty gave
george a nudge with her finger, designed to be immensely facetious, and
turned again to her griddle with great briskness.

â€œnow for the cake,â€ said masâ€™r george, when the activity of the
griddle department had somewhat subsided; and, with that, the youngster
flourished a large knife over the article in question.

who hoped she did know something of the world.

â€œwell, though, iâ€™ve heard you say,â€ said george, â€œthat jinny was a
pretty fair cook.â€

â€œso i did,â€ said aunt chloe,--â€œi may say dat. good, plain, common

â€œthought so!--didnâ€™t she? thar she was, showing em, as innocent--ye see,
itâ€™s jest here, jinny _donâ€™t know_. lor, the family anâ€™t nothing! she

aunt chloe sighed, and rolled up her eyes with emotion.

â€œiâ€™m sure, aunt chloe, i understand my pie and pudding privileges,â€
 said george. â€œask tom lincon if i donâ€™t crow over him, every time i meet
him.â€

aunt chloe sat back in her chair, and indulged in a hearty guffaw of
laughter, at this witticism of young masâ€™râ€™s, laughing till the tears
rolled down her black, shining cheeks, and varying the exercise with
playfully slapping and poking masâ€™r georgey, and telling him to go way,

witty fellow, and that it became him to be careful how he talked â€œas
funny as he could.â€

â€œand so ye telled tom, did ye? o, lor! what young uns will be up ter!
ye crowed over tom? o, lor! masâ€™r george, if ye wouldnâ€™t make a hornbug
laugh!â€

â€œyes,â€ said george, â€œi says to him, â€˜tom, you ought to see some of aunt
chloeâ€™s pies; theyâ€™re the right sort,â€™ says i.â€

â€œpity, now, tom couldnâ€™t,â€ said aunt chloe, on whose benevolent
heart the idea of tomâ€™s benighted condition seemed to make a strong
impression. â€œye oughter just ask him here to dinner, some oâ€™ these
times, masâ€™r george,â€ she added; â€œit would look quite pretty of ye.

â€œand what did mother say?â€ said george.

â€œsay?--why, she kinder larfed in her eyes--dem great handsome eyes oâ€™

â€œwell, you made out well with that dinner,--i remember everybody said

herself up with an air. â€œbery nice man, de gineral! he comes of one of

george; but tanâ€™t everybody knows what they is, or as orter be. but the
gineral, he knows; i knew by his â€˜marks he made. yes, he knows what de

by this time, master george had arrived at that pass to which even a
boy can come (under uncommon circumsta

nces, when he really could not eat
another morsel), and, therefore, he was at leisure to notice the pile of
woolly heads and glistening eyes which were regarding their operations
hungrily from the opposite corner.

â€œhere, you mose, pete,â€ he said, breaking off liberal bits, and throwing
it at them; â€œyou want some, donâ€™t you? come, aunt chloe, bake them some
cakes.â€

and george and tom moved to a comfortable seat in the chimney-corner,
while aunte chloe, after baking a goodly pile of cakes, took her baby
on her lap, and began alternately filling its mouth and her own, and
distributing to mose and pete, who seemed rather to prefer eating theirs
as they rolled about on the floor under the table, tickling each other,
and occasionally pulling the babyâ€™s toes.

â€œo! go long, will ye?â€ said the mother, giving now and then a kick, i

â€œyeâ€™ll all stick together, and never get clar, if ye do dat fashion.
go long to de spring and wash yerselves!â€ she said, seconding her
exhortations by a slap, which resounded very formidably, but which
seemed only to knock out so much more laugh from the young ones, as they
tumbled precipitately over each other out of doors, where they fairly
screamed with merriment.

â€œdid ye ever see such aggravating young uns?â€ said aunt chloe, rather
complacently, as, producing an old towel, kept for such emergencies,
she poured a little water out of the cracked tea-pot on it, and began
rubbing off the molasses from the babyâ€™s face and hands; and, having
polished her till she shone, she set her down in tomâ€™s lap, while she
busied herself in clearing away supper. the baby employed the intervals
in pulling tomâ€™s nose, scratching his face, and burying her fat hands
in his woolly hair, which last operation seemed to afford her spe

content.

â€œaint she a peart young un?â€ said tom, holding her from him to take a
full-length view; then, getting up, he set her on his broad shoulder,
and began capering and dancing with her, while masâ€™r george snapped at
her with his pocket-handkerchief, and mose and pete, now returned again,
roared after her like bears, till aunt chloe declared that they â€œfairly
took her head offâ€ with their noise. as, according to her own statement,
this surgical operation was a matter of daily occurrence in the cabin,
the declaration no whit abated the merriment, till every one had roared
and tumbled and danced themselves down to a state of composure.

â€œwell, now, i hopes youâ€™re done,â€ said aunt chloe, who had been busy
in pulling out a rude box of a trundle-bed; â€œand now, you mose and you
pete, get into thar; for weâ€™s goinâ€™

 to have the meetinâ€™.â€

â€œo mother, we donâ€™t wanter. we wants to sit up to meetinâ€™,--meetinâ€™s is
so curis. we likes â€˜em.â€

â€œla, aunt chloe, shove it under, and let â€˜em sit up,â€ said masâ€™r george,
decisively, giving a push to the rude machine.

aunt chloe, having thus saved appearances, seemed highly delighted to
push the thing under, saying, as she did so, â€œwell, mebbe â€˜t will do â€˜em
some good.â€

the house now resolved itself into a committee of the whole, to consider
the accommodations and arrangements for the meeting.

â€œwhat weâ€™s to do for cheers, now, _i_ declar i donâ€™t know,â€ said aunt
chloe. as the meeting had been held at uncle tomâ€™s weekly, for an
indefinite length of time, without any more â€œcheers,â€ there seemed so

encouragement to hope that a way would be discovered at present.

â€œold uncle peter sung both de legs out of dat oldest cheer, last week,â€
 suggested mose.

â€œyou go long! iâ€™ll bounâ€™ you pulled â€˜em out; some oâ€™ your shines,â€ said
aunt chloe.

â€œwell, itâ€™ll stand, if it only keeps jam up agin de wall!â€ said mose.

â€œden uncle peter musâ€™nâ€™t sit in it, cause he alâ€™ays hitches when he gets
a singing. he hitched pretty nigh across de room, tâ€™ other night,â€ said
pete.

â€œgood lor! get him in it, then,â€ said mose, â€œand den heâ€™d begin, â€˜come
saints--and sinners, hear me tell,â€™ and den down heâ€™d go,â€--and mose
imitated precisely the nasal tones of the old man, tumbling on the
floor, to illustrate the supposed

 catastrophe.

â€œcome now, be decent, canâ€™t ye?â€ said aunt chloe; â€œanâ€™t yer shamed?â€

masâ€™r george, however, joined the offender in the laugh, and declared
decidedly that mose was a â€œbuster.â€ so the maternal admonition seemed
rather to fail of effect.

â€œwell, ole man,â€ said aunt chloe, â€œyouâ€™ll have to tote in them ar
barâ€™ls.â€

â€œmotherâ€™s barâ€™ls is like dat ar widderâ€™s, masâ€™r george was reading
â€˜bout, in de good book,--dey never fails,â€ said mose, aside to peter.

â€œiâ€™m sure one on â€˜em caved in last week,â€ said pete, â€œand let â€˜em all
down in de middle of de singinâ€™; dat ar was failinâ€™, warnt it?â€

during this aside between mose and pete, two empty casks had been rolled
into the cabin, and being secured from rolling, by stones on each side

,
boards were laid across them, which arrangement, together with the
turning down of certain tubs and pails, and the disposing of the rickety
chairs, at last completed the preparation.

â€œmasâ€™r george is such a beautiful reader, now, i know heâ€™ll stay to
read for us,â€ said aunt chloe; â€œâ€˜pears like â€˜t will be so much more

george very readily consented, for your boy is always ready for anything
that makes him of importance.

the room was soon filled with a motley assemblage, from the old
gray-headed patriarch of eighty, to the young girl and lad of fifteen. a
little harmless gossip ensued on various themes, such as where old aunt
sally got her new red headkerchief, and how â€œmissis was a going to give
lizzy that spotted muslin gown, when sheâ€™d got

a few minutes brought them to the window of uncle tomâ€™s cottage, and
eliza stopping, tapped lightly on the window-pane.

the prayer-meeting at uncle tomâ€™s had, in the order of hymn-singing,
been protracted to a very late hour; and, as uncle tom had indulged
himself in a few lengthy solos afterwards, the consequence was, that,
although it was now between twelve and one oâ€™clock, he and his worthy
helpmeet were not yet asleep.

â€œgood lord! whatâ€™s that?â€ said aunt chloe, starting up and hastily
drawing the curtain. â€œmy sakes alive, if it anâ€™t lizy! get on your
clothes, old man, quick!--thereâ€™s old bruno, too, a pawin round; what on
airth! iâ€™m gwine to open the door.â€

and suiting the action to the word, the door flew open, and the light
of the tallow candle, which tom had hastily lighted, fell on the haggard
face and dark, wild eyes of the fugitive.

â€œlord bless you!--iâ€™m skeered to look at ye, lizy! are ye tuck sick, or
whatâ€™s come over ye?â€

mistressâ€™ door tonight, and i heard master tell missis that he had sold
my harry, and you, uncle tom, both, to a trader; and that he was going

today.â€

tom had stood, during this speech, with his hands raised, and his eyes
dilated, like a man i

n a dream. slowly and gradually, as its meaning
came over him, he collapsed, rather than seated himself, on his old
chair, and sunk his head down upon his knees.

â€œthe good lord have pity on us!â€ said aunt chloe. â€œo! it donâ€™t seem as
if it was true! what has he done, that masâ€™r should sell _him_?â€

â€œhe hasnâ€™t done anything,--it isnâ€™t for that. master donâ€™t want to sell,
and missis sheâ€™s always good. i heard her plead and beg for us; but he
told her â€˜t was no use; that he was in this manâ€™s debt, and that this
man had got the power over him; and that if he didnâ€™t pay him off clear,
it would end in his having to sell the place and all the people, and
move off. yes, i heard him say

her so; but, then, i canâ€™t help it. she said, herself, one soul was
worth more than the world; and this boy has a soul, and if i let him be
carried off, who knows whatâ€™ll become of it? it must be right: but, if
it anâ€™t right, the lord forgive me, for i canâ€™t help doing it!â€

â€œwell, old man!â€ said aunt chloe, â€œwhy donâ€™t you go, too? will you
wait to be toted down river, where they kill niggers with hard work and
starving? iâ€™d a heap rather die than go there, any day! thereâ€™s time for
ye,--be off with lizy,--youâ€™ve got a pass to come and go any time. come,
bustle up, and iâ€™ll get your things together.â€

tom slowly raised his head, and looked sorrowfully but quietly around,
and said,

â€œno, no--i anâ€™t going. let eliza go--itâ€™s her right! i wouldnâ€™t be the
one to say no--â€˜tanâ€™

and heâ€™ll think i connived at it, to get him out of the way. it touches

there was great running and ejaculating, and opening and shutting of
doors, and appearance of faces in all shades of color in different
places, for about a quarter of an hour. one person only, who might have
shed some light on the matter, was entirely silent, and that was the
head cook, aunt chloe. silently, and with a heavy cloud settled down
over her once joyous face, she proceeded making out her breakfast
biscuits, as if she heard and saw nothing of the excitement around her.

very soon, about a dozen young imps were roosting, like so many crows,
on the verandah railings, each one determined to be the first one to
apprize the strange masâ€™r of his ill luck.

â€œheâ€™ll be rael mad, iâ€™ll be bound,â€ said andy.

the thought of the pursuer urged
her on; and she gazed with longing eyes on the sullen, surging waters
that lay between her and liberty.

here we must take our leave of her for the present, to follow the course
of her pursuers.


though mrs. shelby had promised that the dinner should be hurried on
table, yet it was soon seen, as the thing has often been seen before,
that it required more than one to make a bargain. so, although the order
was fairly given out in haleyâ€™s hearing, and carried to aunt chloe by at
least half a dozen juvenile messengers, that dignitary only gave certain
very gruff snorts, and tosses of her head, and went on with every
operation in an unusually leisurely and circumstantial manner.

for some singular reason, an impression seemed to reign among the
servants generally that missis would not be particularly disobliged by
delay; and it was wonderful what a number of counter accidents occurred
constantly, to retard the course of things. one luckless wight contrived
to upset

due care and formality, aunt chloe watching and stirring with dogged
precision, answering shortly, to all suggestions of haste, that she

catchings.â€ one tumbled down with the water, and had to go to the spring
for more; and another precipitated the butter into the path of events;
and there was from time to time giggling news brought into the kitchen
that â€œmasâ€™r haley was mighty oneasy, and that he couldnâ€™t sit in his

â€œheâ€™ll go to torment, and no mistake,â€ said little jake.

â€œhe desarves it!â€ said aunt chloe, grimly; â€œheâ€™s broke a many, many,

in her hands; â€œitâ€™s like what masâ€™r george reads in ravelations,--souls

open mouth; and, the dinner being now fairly sent in, the whole kitchen

critturâ€™s soul â€˜s in thatâ€™ll do them ar things,--you oughter thank
god that you anâ€™t _like_ him, chloe. iâ€™m sure iâ€™d rather be sold, ten
thousand times over, than to have all that ar poor critturâ€™s got to
answer for.â€

works. iâ€™m sensible of dat ar; but a poor nigger like me â€˜s â€˜mazinâ€™
tempted to act ugly sometimes, when fellers will cut up such shines as

â€œwell, sam,â€ said mrs. shelby, â€œas you appear to have a proper sense of
your errors, you may go now and tell aunt chloe she may get you some
of that cold ham that was left of dinner today. you and andy must be
hungry.â€

â€œmissis is a heap too good for us,â€ said sam, making his bow with
alacrity, and departing.

it will be perceived, as has been before intimated, that master sam had
a native talent that might, undoubtedly, have raised him to eminence
in political life,--a talent of making capital out of everything that
turned up, to be invested for his own especial praise and glory;
and having done up his pi

ety and humility, as he trusted, to the
satisfaction of the parlor, he clapped his palm-leaf on his head, with
a sort of rakish, free-and-easy air, and proceeded to the dominions of
aunt chloe, with the intention of flourishing largely in the kitchen.

â€œiâ€™ll speechify these yer niggers,â€ said sam to himself, â€œnow iâ€™ve got a
chance. lord, iâ€™ll reel it off to make â€˜em stare!â€

it must be observed that one of samâ€™s especial delights had been to ride
in attendance on his master to all kinds of political gatherings, where,
roosted on some rail fence, or perched aloft in some tree, he would
sit watching the orators, with the greatest apparent gusto, and then,
descending a

burlesques and imitations, all delivered with the most imperturbable
earnestness and solemnity; and though the auditors immediately about him
were generally of his own color, it not infrequently happened that
they were fringed pretty deeply with those of a fairer complexion, who
listened, laughing and winking, to samâ€™s great self-congratulation.
in fact, sam considered oratory as his vocation, and never let slip an
opportunity of magnifying his office.

now, between sam and aunt chloe there had existed, from ancient times,
a sort of chronic feud, or rather a decided coolness; but, as sam was
meditating something in the provision department, as the necessary and
obvious foundation of his operations, he determined, on the present
occasion, to be eminently conciliatory; for he well knew that although
â€œmissisâ€™ ordersâ€ would undoubtedly be followed to the letter, yet
he should gain a considerable deal by enlisting the spirit also. he
therefore appeared before aunt chloe wit

expression, like one who has suffered immeasurable hardships in behalf
of a persecuted fellow-creature,--enlarged upon the fact that missis had
directed him to come to aunt chloe for whatever might be wanting to
make up the balance in his solids and fluids,--and thus unequivocally
acknowledged her right and supremacy in the cooking department, and all
thereto pertaining.

the thing took accordingly. no poor, simple, virtuous body was ever
cajoled by the attentions of an electioneering politician with more ease
than aunt chloe was won over by master samâ€™s suavities; and if he had
been the prodigal son himself, he could not have been overwhelmed with
more maternal bount

â€œitâ€™s the only thing ye ever was persistent in, lord knows!â€ muttered
aunt chloe, who was getting rather restive; the merriment of the evening
being to her somewhat after the scripture comparison,--like â€œvinegar

â€œyes, indeed!â€ said sam, rising, full of supper and glory, for a closing
effort. â€œyes, my feller-citizens and ladies of de other sex in general,

â€œniggers! all on yer,â€ said sam, waving his palm-leaf with benignity, â€œi

and, with this pathetic benediction, the assembly dispersed.

chapter x

the property is carried off


the february morning looked gray and drizzling through the window of
uncle tomâ€™s cabin. it looked on downcast faces, the images of mournful
hearts. the little table stood out before the fire, covered with an
ironing-cloth; a coarse but clean shirt or two, fresh from the iron,
hung on the back of a chair by the fire, and aunt chloe had another
spread out before her on the table. carefully she rubbed and ironed
every fold and every hem, with the most scrupulous exactness, every now
and then raising her hand to her face to wipe off the tears that were
coursing down her cheeks.

tom sat by, with his testament open on his knee, and his head leaning
upon his hand;--but neither spoke. it was yet early, and the children
lay all asleep together in their little rude trundle-bed.

tom, who had, to the full, the gentle, domestic hea

walked silently to look at his children.

â€œitâ€™s the last time,â€ he said.

aunt chloe did not answer, only rubbed away over and over on the coarse
shirt, already as smooth as hands could make it; and finally setting her
iron suddenly down with a despairing plunge, she sat down to the table,
and â€œlifted up her voice and wept.â€

â€œsâ€™pose we must be resigned; but oh lord! how ken i? if i knowâ€™d
anything whar you â€˜s goinâ€™, or how theyâ€™d sarve you! missis says sheâ€™ll

things happen, sometimes. i donâ€™t seem to get no comfort dat way.â€

â€œiâ€™m in the lordâ€™s hands,â€ said tom; â€œnothinâ€™ can go no furder than he

thatâ€™s sold and going down, and not you nur the chilâ€™en. here youâ€™re

choking in his throat,--but he spoke brave and strong.

â€œletâ€™s think on our marcies!â€ he added, tremulously, as if he was quite
sure he needed to think on them very hard indeed.

â€œmarcies!â€ said aunt chloe; â€œdonâ€™t see no marcy in â€˜t! â€˜tanâ€™t right!
tanâ€™t right it should be so! masâ€™r never ought ter left it so that ye

â€œwal, any way, tharâ€™s wrong about it _somewhar_,â€ said aunt chloe, in
whom a stubborn sense of justice was a predominant trait; â€œi canâ€™t jest
make out whar â€˜t is, but tharâ€™s wrong somewhar, iâ€™m _clar_ oâ€™ that.â€

â€œyer ought ter look up to the lord above--heâ€™s above all--thar donâ€™t a

 to brave the perils of escape,
in almost every case, by the desperate horror with which they regarded
being sold south,--a doom which was hanging either over themselves
or their husbands, their wives or children. this nerves the african,
naturally patient, timid and unenterprising, with heroic courage, and
leads him to suffer hunger, cold, pain, the perils of the wilderness,
and the more dread penalties of recapture.

the simple morning meal now smoked on the table, for mrs. shelby had
excused aunt chloeâ€™s attendance at the great house that morning.
the poor soul had expended all her little energies on this farewell
feast,--had killed and dressed her choicest chicken, and prepared her
corn-cake with scrupulous exactness, just to her husbandâ€™s taste, and
brought out certain mysterious jars on the mantel-piece, some preserves
that were never produced except on extreme occasions.

â€œlor, pete,â€ said mose, triumphantly, â€œhanâ€™t we got a buster of a
breakfast!â€ at the same time catching

at a fragment of the chicken.

aunt chloe gave him a sudden box on the ear. â€œthar now! crowing over the
last breakfast yer poor daddyâ€™s gwine to have to home!â€

â€œo, chloe!â€ said tom, gently.

â€œwal, i canâ€™t help it,â€ said aunt chloe, hiding her face in her apron;
â€œi â€˜s so tossed about it, it makes me act ugly.â€

the boys stood quite still, looking first at their father and then
at their mother, while the baby, climbing up her clothes, began an
imperious, commanding cry.

â€œthar!â€ said aunt chloe, wiping her eyes and taking up the baby; â€œnow
iâ€™s done, i hope,--now do eat something. this yerâ€™s my nicest chicken.
thar, boys, ye shall have some, poor critturs! yer mammyâ€™s been cross to
yer.â€

the boys needed

 no second invitation, and went in with great zeal for
the eatables; and it was well they did so, as otherwise there would have
been very little performed to any purpose by the party.

â€œnow,â€ said aunt chloe, bustling about after breakfast, â€œi must put

ing there was on the breakfast-table,
began now to take some thought of the case; and, seeing their mother
crying, and their father looking very sad, began to whimper and put
their hands to their eyes. uncle tom had the baby on his knee, and was
letting her enjoy herself to the utmost extent, scratching his face
and pulling his hair, and occasionally breaking out into clamorous
explosions of delight, evidently arising out of her own internal
reflections.

â€œay, crow away, poor crittur!â€ said aunt chloe; â€œyeâ€™ll have to come to
it, too! yeâ€™ll live to see yer husband sold, or mebbe be sold yerself;
and these yer boys, theyâ€™s to be sold, i sâ€™pose, too, jest like as

here one of the boys called out, â€œtharâ€™s missis a-cominâ€™ in!â€

â€œshe canâ€™t do no good; whatâ€™s she coming for?â€ said aunt chloe.

mrs. shelby entered. aunt chloe set a chair for her in a manner
decidedly gruff and crusty. s

he did not seem to notice either the action
or the manner. she looked pale and anxious.

â€œtom,â€ she said, â€œi come to--â€ and stopping suddenly, and regarding the
silent group, she sat down in the chair, and, covering her face with her
handkerchief, began to sob.

â€œlor, now, missis, donâ€™t--donâ€™t!â€ said aunt chloe, bursting out in her
turn; and for a few moments they all wept in company. and in those tears
they all shed together, the high and the lowly, melted away all
the heart-burnings and anger of the oppressed. o, ye who visit the
distressed, do ye know that everything your money can buy, given with a
cold, averted face, is not worth one honest tear shed in real sympathy?

â€œmy good fellow,â€ said mrs. shelby, â€œi canâ€™t give you anything to do
you any good. if i give you money, it will only be t

here the boys called out that masâ€™r haley was coming, and then an
unceremonious kick pushed open the door. haley stood there in very
ill humor, having ridden hard the night before, and being not at all
pacified by his ill success in recapturing his prey.

â€œcome,â€ said he, â€œye nigger, yeâ€™r ready? servant, maâ€™am!â€ said he,
taking off his hat, as he saw mrs. shelby.

aunt chloe shut and corded the box, and, getting up, looked gruffly on
the trader, her tears seeming suddenly turned to sparks of fire.

tom rose up meekly, to follow his new master, and raised up his heavy
box on his shoulder. his wife took the baby in her arms to go with him
to the wagon, and the children, still crying, trailed on behind.

mrs. shelby, walking up to the trader, detained him for a few moments,
talking with him in an earnest manner; and while she was thus talking,
the whole family party p
 
 ___________________________
 
roceeded to a wagon, that stood ready harnessed
at the door. a crowd of all the old and young hands on the place stood
gathered around it, to bid farewell to their old associate. tom had been
looked up to, both as a head servant and a christian teacher, by all
the place, and there was much honest sympathy and grief about him,
particularly among the women.

â€œwhy, chloe, you bar it better â€˜n we do!â€ said one of the women, who had
been weeping freely, noticing the gloomy calmness with which aunt chloe
stood by the wagon.

â€œiâ€™s done _my_ tears!â€ she said, looking grimly at the trader, who was
coming up. â€œi does not feel to cry â€˜fore dat ar old limb, no how!â€

â€œget in!â€ said haley to tom, as he strode through the crowd of servants,
who looked at him with lowering brows.

tom got in, and haley, drawing out from under the wagon seat a heavy
pair of shackles, made them fast around each ankle.

a smothered groan of indignation ran through the whole circle, and
mrs. shelby spoke fro

precaution is entirely unnecessary.â€

â€œdonâ€™ know, maâ€™am; iâ€™ve lost one five hundred dollars from this yer
place, and i canâ€™t afford to run no more risks.â€

â€œwhat else could she spect on him?â€ said aunt chloe, indignantly,
while the two boys, who now seemed to comprehend at once their fatherâ€™s
destiny, clung to her gown, sobbing and groaning vehemently.

â€œiâ€™m sorry,â€ said tom, â€œthat masâ€™r george happened to be away.â€

george had gone to spend two or three days with a companion on a
neighboring estate, and having departed early in the morning, before
tomâ€™s misfortune had been made public, had left without hearing of it.

â€œgive my love to masâ€™r george,â€ he said, earnestly.

turning his back to the shop, and speaking in a mysterious tone, _â€œiâ€™ve

â€œbut you _shall_ take it!â€ said george; â€œlook here--i told aunt chloe

â€œno, donâ€™t masâ€™r george, for it wonâ€™t do _me_ any good.â€

haley now came to the door, with the handcuffs in his hands.

as he got out, â€œi shall let father and mother know how you treat uncle

â€œdese yer northern ladiesâ€ from the
domestic cabinet.

old dinah, the head cook, and principal of all rule and authority in
the kitchen department, was filled with wrath at what she considered
an invasion of privilege. no feudal baron in _magna charta_ times could
have more thoroughly resented some incursion of the crown.

dinah was a character in her own way, and it would be injustice to her
memory not to give the reader a little idea of her. she was a native
and essential cook, as much as aunt chloe,--cooking being an indigenous
talent of the african race; but chloe was a trained and methodical one,
who moved in an orderly domestic harness, while dinah was a self-taught
genius, and, like geniuses in general, was positive, opinionated and
erratic, to the last degree.

like a certain class of modern philosophers, dinah perfectly scorned
logic and reason in every shape, and always took refuge in intuitive
certainty; and here she was perfectly impregnable. no possible amount of

act was,
that though her husband had stated she was a woman, she had a clear,
energetic, practical mind, and a force of character every way superior
to that of her husband; so that it would not have been so very absurd
a supposition, to have allowed her capable of managing, as mr. shelby
supposed. her heart was set on performing her promise to tom and aunt
chloe, and she sighed as discouragements thickened around her.

â€œdonâ€™t you think we might in some way contrive to raise that money? poor
aunt chloe! her heart is so set on it!â€

â€œiâ€™m sorry, if it is. i think i was premature in promising. iâ€™m not
sure, now, but itâ€™s the best way to tell chloe, and let her make up
her mind to it. tomâ€™ll have another wife, in a year or two; and she had
better take up with somebody else.â€

â€œmr. shelby, i have taught my people that their marriages are as sacred
as ours. i never could think of giving chloe such advice.â€

â€œitâ€™s a pity, wife, that you have burdened them with a morality above

â€œyou wouldnâ€™t degrade yourself that way, emily? i never could consent to

â€œdegrade! would it degrade me as much as to break my faith with the
helpless? no, indeed!â€

â€œwell, you are always heroic and transcendental,â€ said mr. shelby,
â€œbut i think you had better think before you undertake such a piece of
quixotism.â€

here the conversation was interrupted by the appearance of aunt chloe,
at the end of the verandah.

â€œif you please, missis,â€ said she.

â€œwell, chloe, what is it?â€ said her mistress, rising, and going to the
end of the balcony.

â€œif missis would come and look at dis yer lot oâ€™ poetry.â€

chloe had a particular fancy for calling poultry poetry,--an application
of language in which she always persisted, notwithstanding frequent
corrections and advisings from the young members of the family.

â€œla sakes!â€ she would say, â€œi canâ€™t see; one jis good

mrs. shelby smiled as she saw a prostrate lot of chickens and ducks,
over which chloe stood, with a very grave face of consideration.

â€œiâ€™m a thinkin whether missis would be a havin a chicken pie oâ€™ dese
yer.â€

â€œreally, aunt chloe, i donâ€™t much care;--serve them any way you like.â€

chloe stood handling them over abstractedly; it was quite evident that
the chickens were not what she was thinking of. at last, with the short
laugh with which her tribe often introduce a doubtful proposal, she
said,

â€œlaws me, missis! what should masâ€™r and missis be a troublin theirselves
â€˜bout de money, and not a usin whatâ€™s right in der hands?â€ and chloe
laughed again.

â€œi donâ€™t understand you, chloe,â€ said mrs. shelby,

missis would write my pass, and write me a commendation.â€

â€œwell, chloe, iâ€™ll attend to it, if mr. shelby has no objections. i must
speak to him.â€

mrs. shelby went up stairs, and aunt chloe, delighted, went out to her
cabin, to make her preparation.

â€œlaw sakes, masâ€™r george! ye didnâ€™t know i â€˜s a gwine to louisville
tomorrow!â€ she said to george, as entering her cabin, he found her busy
in sorting over her babyâ€™s clothes. â€œi thought iâ€™d jis look over sisâ€™s
things, and get â€˜em straightened up. but iâ€™m gwine, masâ€™r george,--gwine

â€œwhew!â€ said george, â€œhe

 was, therewith to be content.â€ it seemed to him
good and reasonable doctrine, and accorded well with the settled and
thoughtful habit which he had acquired from the reading of that same
book.

his letter homeward, as we related in the last chapter, was in due time
answered by master george, in a good, round, school-boy hand, that
tom said might be read â€œmost acrost the room.â€ it contained various
refreshing items of home intelligence, with which our reader is fully
acquainted: stated how aunt chloe had been hired out to a confectioner
in louisville, where her skill in the pastry line was gaining wonderful
sums of money, all of which, tom was informed, was to be laid up to go
to make up the sum of his redemption money; mose and pete were thriving,
and the baby was trotting all about the house, under the care of sally
and the family generally.

tomâ€™s cabin was shut up for the present; but george expatiated
brilliantly on ornaments and additions to be made to it when tom came
back.

had been paid should be preserved, to show her husband, in memorial of
