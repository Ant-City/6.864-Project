ve, and the very clock on
the chimney-piece (you know you can only see the back of it in the
looking-glass) had got the face of a little old man, and grinned at her.

‘they don’t keep this room so tidy as the other,’ alice thought to
herself, as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth among
the cinders: but in another moment, with a little ‘oh!’ of surprise, she
was down on her hands and knees watching them. the chessmen were walking
about, two and two!

‘here are the red king and the red queen,’ alice said (in a whisper, for
fear of frightening them), ‘and there are the white king and the white
queen sitting on the edge of the shovel--and here are two castles
walking arm in arm--i don’t think they can hear me,’ she went on, as she
put her head closer down, ‘and i’m nearly sure they can’t see me. i feel
somehow as if i were invisible--’

here something began squeaking on the table behind alice, and made her
turn her head just in time to see one of the

-if he didn’t eat so many as the walrus.’

‘but he ate as many as he could get,’ said tweedledum.

this was a puzzler. after a pause, alice began, ‘well! they were both
very unpleasant characters--’ here she checked herself in some alarm,
at hearing something that sounded to her like the puffing of a large
steam-engine in the wood near them, though she feared it was more likely
to be a wild beast. ‘are there any lions or tigers about here?’ she
asked timidly.

‘it’s only the red king snoring,’ said tweedledee.

‘come and look at him!’ the brothers cried, and they each took one of
alice’s hands, and led her up to where the king was sleeping.

‘isn’t he a lovely sight?’ said tweedledum.

alice couldn’t say honestly that he was. he had a tall red night-cap on,
with a tassel, and he was lying crumpled up into a sort of untidy heap,
and snoring loud--‘fit to snore his head off!’ as tweedledum remarked.

‘i’m afraid he’ll catch cold with lying on the dam

silence, and alice lifted up her head in some alarm. there was no one
to be seen, and her first thought was that she must have been dreaming
about the lion and the unicorn and those queer anglo-saxon messengers.
however, there was the great dish still lying at her feet, on which she
had tried to cut the plum-cake, ‘so i wasn’t dreaming, after all,’ she
said to herself, ‘unless--unless we’re all part of the same dream. only
i do hope it’s my dream, and not the red king’s! i don’t like belonging
to another person’s dream,’ she went on in a rather complaining tone:
‘i’ve a great mind to go and wake him, and see what happens!’

at this moment her thoughts were interrupted by a loud shouting of
‘ahoy! ahoy! check!’ and a knight dressed in crimson armour came
galloping down upon her, brandishing a great club. just as he reached
her, the horse stopped suddenly: ‘you’re my prisoner!’ the knight cried,
as he tumbled off his horse.

said to me, all about fishes! to-morrow morning you shall have a real
treat. all the time you’re eating your breakfast, i’ll repeat “the
walrus and the carpenter” to you; and then you can make believe it’s
oysters, dear!

‘now, kitty, let’s consider who it was that dreamed it all. this is a
serious question, my dear, and you should not go on licking your paw
like that--as if dinah hadn’t washed you this morning! you see, kitty,
it must have been either me or the red king. he was part of my dream,
of course--but then i was part of his dream, too! was it the red king,
kitty? you were his wife, my dear, so you ought to know--oh, kitty, do
help to settle it! i’m sure your paw can wait!’ but the provoking kitten
only began on the other paw, and pretended it hadn’t heard the question.

which do you think it was?
