nd. she would find him in attitudes of frightful dejection,
sunk into his armchair in the study that was half a gun-room. she would
notice through the open door that his face was the face of an old, dead
man, when he had no one to talk to. gradually it forced itself upon her
attention that there were profound differences between the pair that she
regarded as her uncle and her aunt. it was a conviction that came very
slowly.

it began with edward's giving an oldish horse to a young fellow called
selmes. selmes' father had been ruined by a fraudulent solicitor and the
selmes family had had to sell their hunters. it was a case that had
excited a good deal of sympathy in that part of the county. and edward,
meeting the young man one day, unmounted, and seeing him to be very
unhappy, had offered to give him an old irish cob upon which he was
riding. it was a silly sort of thing to do really. the horse was worth
from thirty to forty pounds and edward might have known that the gift
would upset his

wife. but edward just had to comfort that unhappy young
man whose father he had known all his life. and what made it all the
worse was that young selmes could not afford to keep the horse even.
edward recollected this, immediately after he had made the offer, and
said quickly:

"of course i mean that you should stable the horse at branshaw until you
have time to turn round or want to sell him and get a better."

nancy went straight home and told all this to leonora who was lying
down. she regarded it as a splendid instance of edward's quick
consideration for the feelings and the circumstances of the distressed.
she thought it would cheer leonor

erce calmness:

"no. no. you're not no good. it's i that am no good. you can't let that
man go on to ruin for want of you. you must belong to him."

the girl, she said, smiled at her with a queer, far-away smile--as if
she were a thousand years old, as if leonora were a tiny child.

"i knew you would come to that," she said, very slowly. "but we are not
worth it--edward and i."

nancy had, in fact, been thinking ever since leonora had made that
comment over the giving of the horse to young selmes. she had been
thinking and thinking, because she had had to sit for many days silent
beside her aunt's bed. (she had always thought of leonora as her aunt.)
and she had had to sit thinking during many silent meals with edward.
and then, at times, with his bloodshot eyes and creased, heavy mouth,
he would smile at her. and gradually the knowledge had come to her
that edward did not love leonora and that leonora hated edward. several
things contributed to form and to harden this conviction. she w

 keep all these people going. i
tell you about leonora and bring her up to date; then about edward, who
has fallen behind. and then the girl gets hopelessly left behind. i wish
i could put it down in diary form. thus: on the 1st of september they
returned from nauheim. leonora at once took to her bed. by the 1st
of october they were all going to meets together. nancy had already
observed very fully that edward was strange in his manner. about the 6th
of that month edward gave the horse to young selmes, and nancy had cause
to believe that her aunt did not love her uncle. on the 20th she read
the account of the divorce case, which is reported in the papers of the
18th and the two following days. on the 23rd she had the conversation
with her aunt in the hall--about marriage in general and about her own
possible marriage, her aunt's coming to her bedroom did not occur until
the 12th of november....

thus she had three weeks for introspection--for introspection beneath
gloomy skies, in that old h
