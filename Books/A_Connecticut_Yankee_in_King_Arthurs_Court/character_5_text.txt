ted me.  as he talked along, softly, pleasantly,
flowingly, he seemed to drift away imperceptibly out of this world
and time, and into some remote era and old forgotten country;
and so he gradually wove such a spell about me that i seemed
to move among the specters and shadows and dust and mold of a gray
antiquity, holding speech with a relic of it!  exactly as i would
speak of my nearest personal friends or enemies, or my most familiar
neighbors, he spoke of sir bedivere, sir bors de ganis, sir launcelot
of the lake, sir galahad, and all the other great names of the
table round--and how old, old, unspeakably old and faded and dry
and musty and ancient he came to look as he went on!  presently
he turned to me and said, just as one might speak of the weather,
or any other common matter--

“you know about transmigration of souls; do you know about
transposition of epochs--and bodies?”

i said i had not heard of it.  he was so little interested--just
as when people speak of the weather--that he

was gone.

all that evening i sat by my fire at the warwick arms, steeped
in a dream of the olden time, while the rain beat upon the windows,
and the wind roared about the eaves and corners.  from time to
time i dipped into old sir thomas malory’s enchanting book, and
fed at its rich feast of prodigies and adventures, breathed in
the fragrance of its obsolete names, and dreamed again.  midnight
being come at length, i read another tale, for a nightcap--this
which here follows, to wit:

how sir launcelot slew two giants, and made a castle free

   anon withal came there upon him two great giants,
   well armed, all save the heads, with two horrible
   clubs in their hands.  sir launcelot put his shield
   afore him, and put the stroke away of the one
   giant, and with his sword he clave his head asunder.
   when his fellow saw that, he ran away as he were
   wood [*demented], for fear of the horrible strokes,
   and sir launcelot after him with all his might,
   and smote him on the shoulder,

and clave him to
   the middle.  then sir launcelot went into the hall,
   and there came afore him three score ladies and
   damsels, and all kneeled unto him, and thanked
   god and him of their deliverance.  for, sir, said
   they, the most part of us have been here this
   seven year their prisoners, and we have worked all
   manner of silk works for our meat, and we are all
   great gentle-women born, and blessed be the time,
   knight, that ever thou wert born; for thou hast
   done the most worship that ever did knight in the
   world, th

   you to tell us your name, that we may tell our
   friends who delivered us out of prison.  fair
   damsels, he said, my name is sir launcelot du
   lake.  and so he departed from them and betaught
   them unto god.  and then he mounted upon his
   horse, and rode into many strange and wild
   countries, and through many waters and valleys,
   and evil was he lodged.  and at the last by
   fortune him happened against a night to come to
   a fair courtilage, and therein he found an old
   gentle-woman that lodged him with a good-will,
   and there he had good cheer for him and his horse.
   and when time was, his host brought him into

 a
   fair garret over the gate to his bed. there
   sir launcelot unarmed him, and set his harness
   by him, and went to bed, and anon he fell on
   sleep. so, soon after there came one on
   horseback, and knocked at the gate in great
   haste.  and when sir launcelot heard this he rose
   up, and looked out at the window, and saw by the
   moonlight three knights come riding after that
   one man, and all three lashed on him at once
   with swords, and that one knight turned on them
   knightly again and defended him. truly, said
   sir launcelot, yonder one knight shall i help,
   for it were shame for me to see three knights
   on one, and if he be slain i am partner of his
   death.  and therewith he took his harness and
   went out at a window by a shee

   knights, and then sir launcelot said on high,
   turn you knights unto me, and leave your

   three left sir kay, and turned unto sir launcelot,
   and there began great battle, for they alight
   all three, and strake many strokes at sir
   launcelot, and assailed him on every side. then
   sir kay dressed him for to have holpen sir
   launcelot.  nay, sir, said he, i will none of
   your help, therefore as ye will have my help
   let me alone with them.  sir kay for the pleasure
   of the knight suffered him for to do his will,
   and so stood aside. and then anon within six
   strokes sir launcelot had stricken them to the earth.

   and then they all three cried, sir knight, we
   yield us unto you as man of might matchless.  as
   to that, said sir launcelot, i will not take
   your yielding unto me, but so that ye yield
   you unt

   him had ye not been; therefore, to yield us unto
   him it were no reason.  well, as to that, said
   sir launcelot, advise you well, for ye may
   choose whether ye will die or live, for an ye be
   yielden, it shall be unto sir kay.  fair knight,
   then they said, in saving our lives we will do
   as thou commandest us.  then shall ye, said sir
   launcelot, on whitsunday next coming go unto the
   court of king arthur, and there shall ye yield
   you unto queen guenever, and put you all three
   in her grace and mercy, and say that sir kay
   sent you thither to be her prisoners.  on the morn

celot arose early, and left sir kay
   sleeping; and sir launcelot took sir kay’s armor
   and his shield and armed him, and so he went to
   the stable and took his horse, and took his leave
   of his host, and so he departed.  then soon after
   arose sir kay and missed sir launcelot; and
   then he espied that he had his armor and his
   horse. now by my faith i know well that he will
   grieve some of the court of king arthur; for on
   him knights will be bold, and deem that it is i,
   and that will beguile them; and because of his
   armor and shield i am sure i shall ride in peace.
   and then soon after departed sir kay, and
   thanked his host.

stranger came in.  i gave him a pipe and a chair, and made

like that, and indeed would have marred it, hindered it, spoiled
its symmetry--perhaps rendered its existence impossible.

there was a fine manliness observable in almost every face; and
in some a certain loftiness and sweetness that rebuked your
belittling criticisms and stilled them.  a most noble benignity
and purity reposed in the countenance of him they called sir galahad,
and likewise in the king’s also; and there was majesty and greatness
in the giant frame and high bearing of sir launcelot of the lake.

there was presently an incident which centered the general interest
upon this sir launcelot.  at a sign from a sort of master of
ceremonies, six or eight of the prisoners rose and came forward
in a body and knelt on the floor and lifted up their hands toward
the ladies’ gallery and begged the grace of a word with the queen.
the most conspicuously situated lady in that massed flower-bed
of feminine show and finery inclined her head by way of assent,
and then the spokesman of the

was equal to the occasion.  he got up and played his hand like
a major--and took every trick.  he said he would state the case
exactly according to the facts; he would tell the simple
straightforward tale, without comment of his own; “and then,”
 said he, “if ye find glory and honor due, ye will give it unto him
who is the mightiest man of his hands that ever bare shield or
strake with sword in the ranks of christian battle--even him that
sitteth there!” and he pointed to sir launcelot.  ah, he fetched
them; it was a rattling good stroke.  then he went on and told
how sir launcelot, seeking adventures, some brief time gone by,
killed seven giants at one sweep of his sword, and set a hundred
and forty-two captive maidens free; and then went further, still
seeking adventures, and found him (sir kay) fighting a desperate
fight against nine foreign knights, and straightway took the battle
solely into his own hands, and conquered the nine; and that night
sir launcelot rose quietly

in another; and all these and the former nine he made to swear
that about whitsuntide they would ride to arthur’s court and yield
them to queen guenever’s hands as captives of sir kay the seneschal,
spoil of his knightly prowess; and now here were these half dozen,
and the rest would be along as soon as they might be healed of
their desperate wounds.

well, it was touching to see the queen blush and smile, and look
embarrassed and happy, and fling furtive glances at sir launcelot
that would have got him shot in arkansas, to a dead certainty.

everybody praised the valor and magnanimity of sir launcelot; and
as for me, i was perfectly amazed, that one man, all by himself,
should have been able to beat down and capture such battalions
of practiced fighters.  i said as much to clarence; but this mocking
featherhead only said:

“an sir kay had had time to get another skin of sour wine into him,
ye had seen the accompt doubled.”

i looked at the boy in sorrow; and as i l

ment and see if i couldn’t invent an improvement
on it.  that reminds me to remark, in passing, that the very first
official thing i did, in my administration--and it was on the very
first day of it, too--was to start a patent office; for i knew
that a country without a patent office and good patent laws was
just a crab, and couldn’t travel any way but sideways or backways.

things ran along, a tournament nearly every week; and now and then
the boys used to want me to take a hand--i mean sir launcelot and
the rest--but i said i would by and by; no hurry yet, and too much
government machinery to oil up and set to rights and start a-going.

we had one tournament which was continued from day to day during
more than a week, and as many as five hundred knights took part
in it, from first to last.  they were weeks gathering.  they came
on horseback from everywhere; from the very ends of the country,
and even from beyond the sea; and many brought ladies, and all
brought squires and troops of servan

  four knights encountered mightily, and brake their
  spears to their hands.  then came sir pertolope from
  the castle, and there encountered with him sir lionel,
  and there sir pertolope the green knight smote down sir
  lionel, brother to sir launcelot.  all this was marked
  by noble heralds, who bare him best, and their names.
  then sir bleobaris brake his spear upon sir gareth,
  but of that stroke sir bleobaris fell to the earth.
  when sir galihodin saw that, he bad sir gareth keep him,

  gareth smote him upon the left side of the helm, that
  he reeled here and there, and he had fallen down had not
  his men recovered him.  truly, said king arthur, that
  knight with the many colors is a good knight.  wherefore
  the king called unto him sir launcelot, and prayed him
  to encounter with that knight.  sir, said launcelot, i
  may as well find in my heart for to forbear him at
  this time, for he hath had travail enough this day, and
  when a good knight doth so well upon some day, it is
  no good knight’s part to let him of his worship, and,
  namely, when he seeth a knight hath done so great
  labour; for peradventure, said sir launcelot, his
  quarrel is here this day, and peradventure he is best

there was an unpleasant little episode that day, which for reasons
of state i struck out of my priest’s report.  you will have noticed
that garry was doing some great fighting in the engagement.  when

for him; it suggests that i had a deep affection for him, and that
was the case.  but it was a private pet name only, and n

presently, and we would get their horses and harness.  i could not
deceive such trusting simplicity, so i said it was a mistake; that
when my fireworks killed at all, they killed instantly; no, the men
would not die, there was something wrong about my apparatus,
i couldn’t tell what; but we must hurry and get away, for those
people would attack us again, in a minute.  sandy laughed, and said:

“lack-a-day, sir, they be not of that breed!  sir launcelot will
give battle to dragons, and will abide by them, and will assail
them again, and yet again, and still again, until he do conquer
and destroy them; and so likewise will sir pellinore and sir aglovale
and sir carados, and mayhap others, but there be none else that
will venture it, let the idle say what the idle will.  and, la,

increasing by degrees, and the reform was steadily spreading.
my soap factory felt the strain early.  at first i had only two
hands; but before i had left home i was already employing fifteen,
and running night and day; and the atmospheric result was getting
so pronounced that the king went sort of fainting and gasping
around and said he did not believe he could stand it much longer,
and sir launcelot got so that he did hardly anything but walk up
and down the roof and swear, although i told him it was worse up
there than anywhere else, but he said he wanted plenty of air; and
he was always complaining that a palace was no place for a soap
factory anyway, and said if a man was to start one in his house
he would be damned if he wouldn’t strangle him.  there were ladies
present, too, but much these people ever cared for that; they would
swear before children, if the wind was their way when t

made dolorous moan, and by the words of it i perceived that he
was cursing and swearing; yet nevertheless was i glad of his
coming, for that i saw he bore a bulletin-board whereon in letters
all of shining gold was writ:

    “use peterson’s prophylactic tooth-brush--all the go.”

i was glad of his coming, for even by this token i knew him for
knight of mine.  it was sir madok de la montaine, a burly great
fellow whose chief distinction was that he had come within an ace
of sending sir launcelot down over his horse-tail once.  he was
never long in a stranger’s presence without finding some pretext
or other to let out that great fact.  but there was another fact
of nearly the same size, which he never pushed upon anybody unasked,
and yet never withheld when asked: that was, that the reason he
didn’t quite succeed was, that he was interrupted and sent down
over horse-tail himself.  this innocent vast lubber did not see
any particular difference between the two facts.  i liked him,

he wanted to glide out the back way and start at once;
but i showed him that that wouldn’t answer.  you see, he was billed
for the king’s-evil--to touch for it, i mean--and it wouldn’t be
right to disappoint the house and it wouldn’t make a delay worth
considering, anyway, it was only a one-night stand.  and i thought
he ought to tell the queen he was going away.  he clouded up at
that and looked sad.  i was sorry i had spoken, especially when
he said mournfully:

“thou forgettest that launcelot is here; and where launcelot is,
she noteth not the going forth of the king, nor what day he returneth.”

of course, i changed the subject.  yes, guenever was beautiful,
it is true, but take her all around she was pretty slack.  i never
meddled in these matters, they weren’t my affair, but i did hate
to see the way things were going on, and i don’t mind saying that
much.  many’s the time she had asked me, “sir boss, hast seen
sir launcelot about?” but if ever she went fretting aroun

indeed, there was too lightsome a tone of flippancy all through
the paper.  it was plain i had undergone a considerable change
without noticing it.  i found myself unpleasantly affected by
pert little irreverencies which would have seemed but proper and

his answer came straight back:

“they don’t know anything about the telegraph; they haven’t had
any experience yet, the line to london is so new.  better not
venture that.  they might hang you.  think up something else.”

might hang us!  little he knew how closely he was crowding the
facts.  i couldn’t think up anything for the moment.  then an idea
struck me, and i started it along:

“send five hundred picked knights with launcelot in the lead; and
send them on the jump.  let them enter by the southwest gate, and
look out for the man with a white cloth around his right arm.”

the answer was prompt:

“they shall start in half an hour.”

“all right, clarence; now tell this lad here that i’m a friend
of yours and a dead-head; and that he must be discreet and say
nothing about this visit of mine.”

chapter xxxviii

sir launcelot and knights to the rescue

nearing four in the afternoon.  the scene was just outside the
walls of london.  a cool, comfortable, superb day, with a brilliant
sun; the kind of day to make one want to live, not die.  the
multitude was prodigious and far-reaching; and yet we fifteen
poor devils hadn’t a friend in it.  there was something painful
in that thought, look at it how you might.  there we sat, on our
tall scaffold, the butt of the hate and mockery of all those
enemies.  we were being ma

shake off that clinging impotence.  but when i saw them put the
noose around his neck, then everything let go in me and i made
a spring to the rescue--and as i made it i shot one more glance
abroad--by george! here they came, a-tilting!--five hundred mailed
and belted knights on bicycles!

the grandest sight that ever was seen.  lord, how the plumes
streamed, how the sun flamed and flashed from the endless procession
of webby wheels!

i waved my right arm as launcelot swept in--he recognized my rag
--i tore away noose and bandage, and shouted:

“on your knees, every rascal of you, and salute the king!  who
fails shall sup in hell to-night!”

i always use that high style when i’m climaxing an effect.  well,
it was noble to see launcelot and the boys swarm up onto that
scaffold and heave sheriffs and such overboard.  and it was fine
to see that astonished multitude go down on their knees and beg
their lives of the king they had just been deriding and ins

nother.
when i had snaked five men out, things began to look serious to
the ironclads, and they stopped and consulted together.  as a
result, they decided that it was time to waive etiquette and send
their greatest and best against me.  to the astonishment of that
little world, i lassoed sir lamorak de galis, and after him
sir galahad.  so you see there was simply nothing to be done now,
but play their right bower--bring out the superbest of the superb,
the mightiest of the mighty, the great sir launcelot himself!

a proud moment for me?  i should think so.  yonder was arthur,
king of britain; yonder was guenever; yes, and whole tribes of
little provincial kings and kinglets; and in the tented camp yonder,
renowned knights from many lands; and likewise the selectest body
known to chivalry, the knights of the table round, the most
illustrious in christendom; and biggest fact of all, the very sun
of their shining system was yonder couching his lance, the focal
point of forty thousand adoring eyes;

 and all by myself, here was
i laying for him.  across my mind flitted the dear image of a
certain hello-girl of west hartford, and i wished she could see
me now.  in that moment, down came the invincible, with the rush
of a whirlwind--the courtly world rose to its feet and bent forward
--the fateful coils went circling through the air, and before you
could wink i was towing sir launcelot across the field on his
back, and kissing my hand to the storm of waving kerchiefs and
the thunder-crash of applause that greeted me!

said i to myself, as i coiled my lariat and hung it on my saddle-horn,
and sat there drunk with glory, “the victory is perfect--no other
will venture against me--knight-errantry is dead.”  now imagine my
astonishment--and everybody else’s, too--to hear the peculiar
bugle-call which announces that another competitor is about to
enter the lists!  there was a

then merlin mixed in:

“he brought but the one because there was but the one to bring.
there exists none other but that one.  it belongeth to the king
of the demons of the sea.  this man is a pretender, and ignorant,
else he had known that that weapon can be used in but eight bouts
only, and then it vanisheth away to its home under the sea.”

“then is he weaponless,” said the king.  “sir sagramore, ye will
grant him leave to borrow.”

“and i will lend!” said sir launcelot, limping up.  “he is as
brave a knight of his hands as any that be on live, and he shall
have mine.”

he put his hand on his sword to draw it, but sir sagramor said:

“stay, it may not be.  he shall fight with his own weapons; it
was his privilege to choose them and bring them.  if he has erred,
on his head be it.”

“knight!” said the king.  “thou’rt overwrought with passion; it
disorders thy mind.  wouldst kill a naked man?”

“an he do it, he shall answer it to me,” said

sir launcelot.

“i will answer it to any he that desireth!” retorted sir sagramor hotly.

merlin broke in, rubbing his hands and smiling his lowdownest
smile of malicious gratification:

“‘tis well said, right well said!  and ‘tis enough of parleying,
let my lord the king deliver the battle signal.”

the king had to yield.  the bugle made proclamation, and we turned
apart and rode to our stations.  there we stood, a hundred yards
apart, facing each other, rigid and motionless, like horsed statues

that was a comfort.  she was far from dead yet.  i sent for
preparations of sulphur, i rousted out the croup-kettle myself;
for i don’t sit down and wait for doctors when sandy or the child
is sick.  i knew how to nurse both of them, and had had experience.
this little chap had lived in my arms a good part of its small life,
and often i could soothe away its troubles and get it to laugh
through the tear-dews on its eye-lashes when even its mother couldn’t.

sir launcelot, in his richest armor, came striding along the great
hall now on his way to the stock-board; he was president of the
stock-board, and occupied the siege perilous, which he had bought
of sir galahad; for the stock-board consisted of the knights of
the round table, and they used the round table for business purposes
now.  seats at it were worth--well, you would never believe the
figure, so it is no use to state it.  sir launcelot was a bear, and
he had put up a corner in one of the new lines, and

 was just getting
ready to squeeze the shorts to-day; but what of that?  he was
the same old launcelot, and when he glanced in as he was passing
the door and found out that his pet was sick, that was enough
for him; bulls and bears might fight it out their own way for all
him, he would come right in here and stand by little hello-central
for all he was worth.  and that was what he did.  he shied his
helmet into the corner, and in half a minute he had a new wick
in the alcohol lamp and was firing up on the croup-kettle.  by this
time sandy had built a blanket canopy over the crib, and everything

was ready.

sir launcelot got up steam, he and i loaded up the kettle with
unslaked lime and carbolic acid, with a touch of lactic acid added
thereto, then filled the thing up with water and inserted the
steam-spout under the canopy.  everything was ship-shape now,
and we sat down on either side of the crib to stand our watch.
sandy was so grateful and so comforted that she charged a couple
of church-wardens with willow-bark and sumach-tobacco for us,
and told us to smoke as much as we pleased, it couldn’t get under

he canopy, and she was used to smoke, being the first lady in the
land who had ever seen a cloud blown.  well, there couldn’t be
a more contented or comfortable sight than sir launcelot in his
noble armor sitting in gracious serenity at the end of a yard
of snowy church-warden.  he was a beautiful man, a lovely man,
and was just intended to make a wife and children happy.  but, of
course guenever--however, it’s no use to cry over what’s done and
can’t be helped.

well, he stood watch-and-watch with me, right straight through,
for three days and nights, till the child was out of danger; then

he knew me as easily as if i hadn’t been disguised at all.  which
frightened me; one may easily believe that.

“quick, now, tell me the meaning of this fearful disaster,” i said.
“how did it come about?”

“well, if there hadn’t been any queen guenever, it wouldn’t have
come so early; but it would have come, anyway.  it would have
come on your own account by and by; by luck, it happened to come
on the queen’s.”

“_and_ sir launcelot’s?”

“just so.”

“give me the details.”

“i reckon you will grant that during some years there has been
only one pair of eyes in these kingdoms that has not been looking
steadily askance at the queen and sir launcelot--”

“yes, king arthur’s.”

“--and only one heart that was without suspicion--”

“yes--the king’s; a heart that isn’t capable of thinking evil

devastating tale upon him.  _tableau_.  a trap is laid for launcelot,
by the king’s command, and sir launcelot walks into it.  he made
it sufficiently uncomfortable for the ambushed witnesses--to wit,
mordred, agravaine, and twelve knights of lesser rank, for he
killed every one of them but mordred; but of course that couldn’t
straighten matters between launcelot and the king, and didn’t.”

unarmed, and were merely there to witness the queen’s punishment.

“well, the rest of the tale is just war, pure and simple.  launcelot
retreated to his town and castle of joyous gard, and gathered
there a great following of knights.  the king, with a great host,
went there, and there was desperate fighting during several days,
