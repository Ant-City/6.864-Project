The Knight - 
                    The
first pilgrim Chaucer describes in the General Prologue, and the
teller of the first tale. The Knight represents the ideal of a medieval
Christian man-at-arms. He has participated in no less than fifteen
of the great crusades of his era. Brave, experienced, and prudent,
the narrator greatly admires him.
