 you were my conqueror; and that
my sword, made weak by my affection, would
obey it on all cause.

cleopatra.
pardon, pardon!

antony.
fall not a tear, i say; one of them rates
all that is won and lost: give me a kiss;
even this repays me.--we sent our schoolmaster;
is he come back?--love, i am full of lead.--
some wine, within there, and our viands!--fortune knows
we scorn her most when most she offers blows.

caesar.
let him appear that's come from antony.--
know you him?

dolabella.
caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster:
an argument that he is pluck'd, when hither
he sends so poor a pinion of his wing,
which had superfluous kings for messengers
not many moons gone by.

[enter euphronius.]

caesar.
approach, and speak.

euphronius.
such as i am, i come from antony:
i was of late as petty to his ends
as is the morn-dew on the myrtle leaf
to his grand sea.

sir, his chests and treasure
he has not with him.

antony.
is he gone?

most certain.

antony.
go, eros, send his treasure after; do it;
detain no jot, i charge thee; write to him--
i will subscribe,--gentle adieus and greetings;
say that i wish he never find more cause
to change a master.--o, my fortunes have
corrupted honest men!--eros, despatch.

go forth, agrippa, and begin the fight:
our will is antony be took alive;
make it so known.

agrippa.
caesar, i shall.

caesar.
the time of universal peace is near:
prove this a prosperous day, the three-nook'd world
shall bear the olive freely.

upon himself.

come hither, proculeius. go and say
we purpose her no shame: give her what comforts
the quality of her passion shall require
lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
she do defeat us; for her life in rome
would be eternal in our triumph: go,
and with your speediest bring us what she says,
and how you find her.

dolabella!

let him alone, for i remember now
how he's employ'd; he shall in time be ready.
go with me to my tent; where you shall see
how hardly i was drawn into this war;
how calm and gentle i proceeded still
in all my writings: go with me, and see
what i can show in this.

nor once be chastis'd with the sober eye
of dull octavia. shall they hoist me up,
and show me to the shouting varletry
of censuring rome? rather a ditch in egypt
be gentle grave unto me! rather on nilus' mud
lay me stark-nak'd, and let the water-flies
blow me into abhorring! rather make
my country's high pyramides my gibbet,
and hang me up in chains!

proculeius.
you do extend
these thoughts of horror further than you shall
find cause in caesar.

[enter dolabella.]

dolabella.
proculeius,
what thou hast done thy master caesar knows,
and he hath sent for thee: as for the queen,
i'll take her to my guard.

proculeius.
so, dolabella,
it shall content me best: be gentle to her.--
[to cleopatra.] to caesar i will speak what you shall please,
if you'll employ me to him.

cleopatra.

most noble empress, you have heard of me?

i cannot tell.

cleopatra.
no matter, sir, what i have heard or known.
you laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;
is't not your trick?

dolabella.
i understand not, madam.

cleopatra.
i dream'd there was an emperor antony:--
o, such another sleep, that i might see
but such another man!

dolabella.
if it might please you,--

cleopatra.
his face was as the heavens; and therein stuck
a sun and moon, which kept their course, and lighted
the little o, the earth.

dolabella.
most sovereign creature,--

cleopatra.
his legs bestrid the ocean; his rear'd arm
crested the world: his voice was propertied
as all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;
but when he meant to quail and shake the orb,
he was as rattling thunder. for his bounty,
there was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
that grew the more by reaping: his delights
were dolphin-like; they show'd his back above
the element they liv'd in: in his livery
walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands we

cleopatra,--

cleopatra.
think you there was or might be such a man
as this i dream'd of?

dolabella.
gentle madam, no.

cleopatra.
you lie, up to the hearing of the gods.
but if there be, or ever were, one such,
it's past the size of dreaming: nature wants stuff
to vie strange forms with fancy: yet to imagine
an antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,
condemning shadows quite.

dolabella.
hear me, good madam.
your loss is, as yourself, great; and you bear it
as answering to the weight: would i might never
o'ertake pursu'd success, but i do feel,
by the rebound of yours, a grief that smites
my very heart at root.

cleopatra.
i thank you, sir.
know you what caesar means to do with me?

dolabella.
i am loath to tell you what i would you knew.

cleopatra.
nay, pray you, sir,--

dolabella.
though he be honourable,--

cleopatra.
he'll lead me, then, in triumph?

arise, you shall not kneel:--
i pray you, rise; rise, egypt.

cleopatra.
sir, the gods
will have it thus; my master and my lord
i must obey.

caesar.
take to you no hard thoughts;
the record of what injuries you did us,
though written in our flesh, we shall remember
as things but done by chance.

madam, as thereto sworn by your command,
which my love makes religion to obey,

you with your children will he send before:
make your best use of this: i have perform'd
your pleasure and my promise.

i shall remain your debtor.

now, iras, what think'st thou?
thou, an egyptian puppet, shall be shown
in rome as well as i: mechanic slaves,
with greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shall
uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,
rank of gross diet, shall we be enclouded,
and forc'd to drink their vapour.

iras.
the gods forbid!

cleopatra.
nay, 'tis most certain, iras:--saucy lictors
will catch at us like strumpets; and scald rhymers
ballad us out o' tune: the quick comedians
extemporally will stage
