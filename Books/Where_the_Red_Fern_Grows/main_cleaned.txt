where the red fern grows
i

when  i  left  my  office  that  beautiful  spring
day, i had no idea what was in store for me.
to begin with, everything was too perfect
for anything unusual to happen. it was one
of those days when a man feels good, feels
like  speaking  to  his  neighbor,  is  glad  to
live  in  a  country  like  ours,  and  proud  of
his  government. you  know  what  i  mean,
one of those rare days when everything is
right and nothing is wrong.

i  was  walking  along  whistling  when  i
heard  the  dogfight.  at  first  i  paid  no
attention to it. after all it wasn’t anything
to get excited about, just another dogfight
in a residential section.

as the sound of the fight grew nearer, i
could  tell  there  were  quite  a  few  dogs
mixed up in it. they boiled out of an alley,
turned,  and  headed  straight  toward  me.
not  wanting  to  get  bitten  or  run  over,  i
moved over to the edge of the sidewalk.

i  could  see  that  all  the  dogs  were
fighting  one. about  twenty-five  feet  from
me  they  caught  him  and  down  he  went.  i
felt sorry for the unfortunate one. i knew if
something  wasn’t  done  quickly
the
sanitation department would have to pick
up a dead dog.

i was trying to make up my mind to help
when  i  got  a  surprise.  up  out  of  that
snarling,  growling,  slashing  mass  reared
an old redbone hound. for a second i saw
him. i caught my breath. i couldn’t believe
what i had seen.

twisting  and  slashing,  he  fought  his
way through the pack and backed up under
the  low  branches  of  a  hedge.  growling
and  snarling,  they  formed  a  halfmoon
circle around him. a big bird dog, bolder
than the others, darted in. the hedge shook
as he tangled with the hound. he came out
so fast he fell over backwards. i saw that
his right ear was split wide open. it was
too much for him and he took off down the
street, squalling like a scalded cat.

a big ugly cur tried his luck. he didn’t
get off so easy. he came out with his left
shoulder  laid  open  to  the  bone.  he  sat
down on his rear and let the world know
that he had been hurt.

by  this  time,  my  fighting  blood  was
boiling.  it’s  hard  for  a  man  to  stand  and
watch  an  old  hound  fight  against  such

odds, especially if that man has memories
in his heart like i had in mine. i had seen
the time when an old hound like that had
given his life so that i might live.

taking  off  my  coat,  i  waded  in.  my
yelling  and  scolding  didn’t  have  much
effect, but the swinging coat did. the dogs
scattered and left.

down on my knees, i peered back under
the  hedge.  the  hound  was  still  mad.  he
growled  at  me  and  showed  his  teeth.  i
knew it wasn’t his nature to fight a man.

in a soft voice, i started talking to him.
“come on, boy,” i said. “it’s all right. i’m
your friend. come on now.”

the  fighting  fire  slowly  left  his  eyes.
he bowed his head and his long, red tail
started
i  kept
coaxing. on his stomach, an inch at a time,

the  ground.

thumping

i  almost  cried  at  what  i  saw.  his  coat
was  dirty  and  mud-caked.  his  skin  was
stretched drum-tight over his bony frame.
the knotty joints of his hips and shoulders
stood  out  a  good  three  inches  from  his
body. i could tell he was starved.

i couldn’t figure it out. he didn’t belong
in town. he was far out of place with the
boxers,  poodles,  bird  dogs,  and  other
breeds  of  town  dogs.  he  belonged  in  the
country. he was a hunting hound.

he  came  to  me  and  laid  his  head  in  my
hand.

i raised one of his paws. there i read
the story. the pads were worn down slick
as  the  rind  on  an  apple.  i  knew  he  had
come a long way, and no doubt had a long
way  to  go. around  his  neck  was  a  crude
collar. on closer inspection, i saw it had

been  made  from  a  piece  of  check-line
leather.  two  holes  had  been  punched  in
each end and the ends were laced together
with bailing wire.

as i turned the collar with my finger, i
saw  something  else.  there,  scratched
deep  in  the  tough  leather,  was  the  name
“buddie.”  i  guessed
the  crude,
scribbly letters had probably been written
by a little boy.

it’s  strange  indeed  how  memories  can
lie dormant in a man’s mind for so many
years.  yet
those  memories  can  be
awakened  and  brought  forth  fresh  and
new,  just  by  something  you’ve  seen,  or
something you’ve heard, or the sight of an
old familiar face.

gratitude,  i  took  hold  of  his  collar  and
said,  “come  on,  boy,  let’s  go  home  and
get something to eat.”

he  seemed  to  understand  that  he  had

found a friend. he came willingly.

i  gave  him  a  bath  and  rubbed  all  the
soreness  from  his  muscles.  he  drank
quarts of warm milk and ate all the meat i
had  in  the  house.  i  hurried  down  to  the
store and bought more. he ate until he was
satisfied.

he  slept  all  that  night  and  most  of  the
next  day.  late  in  the  afternoon  he  grew
restless.  i  told  him  i  understood,  and  as
soon  as  it  was  dark,  he  could  be  on  his
way. i figured he had a much better chance
if he left town at night.

that  evening,  a  little  after  sundown,  i

opened  the  back  gate.  he  walked  out,
stopped, turned around, and looked at me.
he thanked me by wagging his tail.

with  tears  in  my  eyes,  i  said,  “you’re
more  than  welcome,  old  fellow.  in  fact,
you  could’ve  stayed  here  as  long  as  you
wanted to.”

he whined and licked my hand.
i was wondering which way he would
go. with one final whimper he turned and
headed  east.  i  couldn’t  help  smiling  as  i
watched him trot down the alley. i noticed
the  way  his  hind  quarters  shifted  over  to
the right, never in line with the front, yet
always  in  perfect  rhythm.  his  long  ears
flopped  up  and  down,  keeping  time  with
the jogging motion of his body. yes, they
were all there, the unmistakable marks of
a hunting hound.

where the alley emptied into the street,
he stopped and looked back. i waved my
hand.

as  i  watched  him  disappear  in  the
twilight  shadows,  i  whispered
these
words:  “good-bye,  old  fellow.  good
luck, and good hunting!”

i didn’t have to let him go. i could have
kept him in my back yard, but to pen up a
dog like that is a sin. it would have broken
his  heart.  the  will  to  live  would  have
slowly left his body.

i had no idea where he had come from
or where he was going. perhaps it wasn’t
too far, or maybe it was a long, long way.
i  tried  to  make  myself  believe  that  his
home  was
the  ozark  mountains
somewhere  in  missouri,  or  oklahoma.  it
wasn’t  impossible  even  though  it  was  a

in

i  figured  something  drastic  must  have
happened in his life, as it is very unusual
for  a  hound  to  be  traveling  all  alone.
perhaps he had been stolen, or maybe he
had  been  sold  for  some  much-needed
money.  whatever
that  had
interrupted  his  life,  he  was  trying  to
straighten it out. he was going home to the
master he loved, and with the help of god,
he would make it.

it  was

long way from the snake river valley in
idaho.

to him it made no difference how long
the road, or how rough or rocky. his old
red feet would keep jogging along, on and
on,  mile  after  mile.  there  would  be  no
crying  or  giving  up.  when  his  feet  grew
tired  and  weary,  he  would  curl  up  in  the
weeds and rest. water from a rain puddle

or  a  mountain  stream  would  quench  his
thirst  and  cool  his  hot  dry  throat.  food
found along the highway, or the offerings
from a friendly hand would ease the pangs
of hunger. through the rains, the snows, or
the desert heat, he would jog along, never
looking back.

some  morning  he  would  be  found
curled  up  on  the  front  porch.  the  long
journey  would  be  over.  he  would  be
home.  there  would  be  a  lot  of  tail-
wagging and a few whimpering cries. his
warm moist tongue would caress the hand
of  his  master.  all  would  be  forgiven.
once  again  the  lights  would  shine  in  his
dog’s world. his heart would be happy.

after my friend had disappeared in the
darkness,  i  stood  and  stared  at  the  empty
alley. a strange feeling came over me. at

first  i  thought  i  was  lonely  or  sad,  but  i
realized  that  wasn’t  it  at  all.  the  feeling
was a wonderful one.

treasures

although  the  old  hound  had  no  way  of
knowing it, he had stirred memories, and
what  priceless
they  were.
memories of my boyhood days, an old k.
c. baking powder can, and two little red
hounds.  memories  of  a  wonderful  love,
unselfish  devotion,  and  death
its
saddest form.

as i turned to enter my yard i started to
lock the gate, and then i thought, “no, i’ll
leave it open. he might come back.”

i was about halfway to the house when
a  cool  breeze  drifted  down  from  the
rugged  tetons.  it  had  a  bite  in  it  and
goosepimples  jumped  out  on  my  skin.  i
stopped  at  the  woodshed  and  picked  up

i  didn’t  turn  on  any  lights  on  entering
the house. the dark, quiet atmosphere was
a perfect setting for the mood i was in. i
built a fire in the fireplace and pulled up
my favorite rocker.

as  i  sat  there  in  the  silence,  the  fire
grew  larger.  it  crackled  and  popped.
firelight  shadows  began  to  shimmer  and
dance  around
the  room.  the  warm,
comfortable heat felt good.

several sticks of wood.

i struck a match to light my pipe. as i
did, two beautiful cups gleamed from the
mantel. i held the match up so i could get a
better  look.  there  they  were,  sitting  side
by side. one was large with long, upright
handles  that  stood  out  like  wings  on  a
morning dove. the highly polished surface
gleamed  and  glistened  with  a  golden

sheen. the other was smaller and made of
silver. it was neat and trim, and sparkled
like a white star in the heavens.

i got up and took them down. there was
a  story  in  those  cups—a  story  that  went
back more than a half century.

as  i  caressed  the  smooth  surfaces,  my
mind drifted back through the years, back
to  my  boyhood  days.  how  wonderful  the
memories  were.  piece  by  piece  the  story
unfolded.

ii

i  suppose  there’s  a  time  in  practically  every
young boy’s life when he’s affected by that
wonderful disease of puppy love. i don’t
mean the kind a boy has for the pretty little
girl  that  lives  down  the  road.  i  mean  the
real kind, the kind that has four small feet
and a wiggly tail, and sharp little teeth that
can gnaw on a boy’s finger; the kind a boy
can  romp  and  play  with,  even  eat  and
sleep with.

i was ten years old when i first became
infected  with  this  terrible  disease.  i’m
sure no boy in the world had it worse than
i did. it’s not easy for a young boy to want
a dog and not be able to have one. it starts

gnawing  on  his  heart,  and  gets  all  mixed
up in his dreams. it gets worse and worse,
until finally it becomes almost unbearable.
if  my  dog-wanting  had  been  that  of  an
ordinary  boy,  i’m  sure  my  mother  and
father would have gotten me a puppy, but
my wants were different. i didn’t want just
one  dog.  i  wanted  two,  and  not  just  any
kind  of  a  dog.  they  had  to  be  a  special
kind and a special breed.

i had to have some dogs. i went to my
father  and  had  a  talk  with  him.  he
scratched his head and thought it over.

“well, billy,” he said, “i heard that old
man  hatfield’s  collie  is  going  to  have
pups.  i’m  sure  i  can  get  one  of  them  for
you.”

he may as well have poured cold water
on me. “papa,” i said, “i don’t want an old

collie  dog.  i  want  hounds—coon  hounds
—and i want two of them.”

i could tell by the look on his face that

he wanted to help me, but couldn’t.

he said, “billy, those kind of dogs cost
money,  and  that’s  something  we  don’t
have right now. maybe some day when we
can  afford  it,  you  can  have  them,  but  not
right now.”

i  didn’t  give  up.  after  my  talk  with
papa,  i  went  to  mama.  i  fared  no  better
there. right off she said i was too young to
be hunting with hounds. besides, a hunter
needed  a  gun,  and  that  was  one  thing  i
couldn’t have, not until i was twenty-one
anyway.

i  couldn’t  understand  it.  there  i  was
sitting  right  in  the  middle  of  the  finest
hunting  country  in  the  world  and  i  didn’t

our home was in a beautiful valley far
back  in  the  rugged  ozarks.  the  country
was  new  and  sparsely  settled.  the  land
we  lived  on  was  cherokee  land,  allotted
to  my  mother  because  of  the  cherokee
blood that flowed in her veins. it lay in a
strip from the foothills of the mountains to
the  banks  of

northeastern oklahoma.

the  land  was  rich,  black,  and  fertile.
papa  said  it  would  grow  hair  on  a
crosscut saw. he was the first man to stick
the cold steel point of a turning plow into
the virgin soil.

mama  had  picked  the  spot  for  our  log
house. it nestled at the edge of the foothills
in  the  mouth  of  a  small  canyon,  and  was
surrounded  by  a  grove  of  huge  red  oaks.

behind our house one could see miles and
miles  of  the  mighty  ozarks.  in  the  spring
the  aromatic  scent  of  wild  flowers,
redbuds, papaws, and dogwoods, drifting
on  the  wind  currents,  spread  over  the
valley and around our home.

below our fields, twisting and winding,
ran  the  clear  blue  waters  of  the  illinois
river.  the  banks  were  cool  and  shady.
the  rich  bottom  land  near  the  river  was
studded with tall sycamores, birches, and
box elders.

to a ten-year-old country boy it was the
most  beautiful  place  in  the  whole  wide
world,  and  i  took  advantage  of  it  all.  i
roamed  the  hills  and  the  river  bottoms.  i
knew  every  game

the  ones  that  fascinated  me  the  most
were the baby-like tracks of a river coon.
i’d  lie  for  hours  examining  them.  before
leaving, i’d take a switch and sweep them
all away. these i called my “trail looks.”
the  next  day  i’d  hurry  back,  and  sure
enough, nine times out of ten, there in the
clean-swept ground i would again find the
tracks of a ringtail coon.

i  knew  he  had  passed  over  the  trail
during the night. i could close my eyes and
almost see him, humped up and waddling
along,  fishing  under  the  banks  with  his
delicate  little  paws  for  crawfish,  frogs,
and minnows.

riverbanks.

i  was  a  hunter  from  the  time  i  could
walk.  i  caught  lizards  on  the  rail  fences,
rats in the corncrib, and frogs in the little

creek  that  ran  through  the  fields.  i  was  a
young daniel boone.

as  the  days  passed,  the  dog-wanting
disease  grew  worse.  i  began  to  see  dogs
in my sleep. i went back to my father and
mother.  it  was  the  same  old  story.  good
hounds  cost  money,  and  they  just  didn’t
have it.

“i know,” said papa, “and i feel just as
badly as you do, but what can i do? you
know we don’t have that kind of money.”

my dog-wanting became so bad i began
to  lose  weight  and  my  food  didn’t  taste
good any more. mama noticed this and she
had a talk with papa.
“you’re  going

to  do
something,” she said. “i never saw a boy
grieve like that. it’s not right, not right at
all.”

to  have

“i don’t care,” said mama. “you’ve got
to  do  something.  i  can’t  stand  to  see  him
cry like that. besides he’s getting to be a
problem.  i  can’t  get  my  work  done.  he
follows  me  around  all  day  long  begging
for hounds.”

“i offered to get him a dog,” said papa,
“but he doesn’t want just any kind of dog.
he wants hounds, and they cost money. do
you  know  what  the  parker  boys  paid  for
those  two  hounds  they  bought?  seventy-
five dollars! if i had that much money, i’d
buy another mule. i sure do need one.”

i had overheard this conversation from
another  room.  at  first  it  made  me  feel
pretty good. at least i was getting to be a
problem.  then  i  didn’t  feel  so  good.  i
knew my mother and father were poor and
didn’t  have  any  money.  i  began  to  feel

sorry for them and myself.

after  thinking  it  over,  i  figured  out  a
way  to  help.  even  though  it  was  a  great
sacrifice,  i  told  papa  i  had  decided  i
didn’t  want  two  hounds.  one  would  be
enough. i saw the hurt in his eyes. it made
me feel like someone was squeezing water
out of my heart.

papa  set  me  on  his  lap  and  we  had  a
good  talk.  he  told  me  how  hard  times
were,  and  that  it  looked  like  a  man
couldn’t  get  a  fair  price  for  anything  he
raised.  some  of  the  farmers  had  quit
farming  and  were  cutting  railroad  ties  so
they  could  feed  their  families.  if  things
didn’t get better, that’s what he’d have to
do. he said he’d give anything if he could
get  some  good  hounds  for  me,  but  there
didn’t seem to be any way he could right

then.

i went off to bed with my heart all torn
up  in  little  pieces,  and  cried  myself  to
sleep.

the  next  day  papa  had  to  go  to  the
store. late that evening i saw him coming
back. as fast as i could, i ran to meet him,
expecting  a  sack  of  candy.  instead  he
handed me three small steel traps.

if santa claus himself had come down
out  of  the  mountains,  reindeer  and  all,  i
would  not  have  been  more  pleased.  i
jumped  up  and  down,  and  cried  a  whole
bucketful  of  tears.  i  hugged  him  and  told
him what a wonderful papa he was.

he  showed  me  how  to  set  them  by
mashing  the  spring  down  with  my  foot,
and how to work the trigger. i took them to
bed with me that night.

the  next  morning  i  started  trapping
around  the  barn.  the  first  thing  i  caught
was  samie,  our  house  cat.  if  this  didn’t
cause  a  commotion!  i  didn’t  intend  to
catch him. i was trying to catch a rat, but
somehow he came nosing around and got
in my trap.

my  sisters  started  bawling  and  yelling
for  mama.  she  came  running,  wanting  to
know  what  in  the  world  was  going  on.
none of us had to tell her. samie told her
with his spitting and squalling.

he  was  mad.  he  couldn’t  understand
what  that  thing  was  that  was  biting  his
foot,  and  he  was  making  an  awful  fuss
about  it.  his  tail  was  as  big  as  a  wet
corncob and every hair on his small body
was  sticking  straight  up.  he  spit  and
yowled  and  dared  anyone  to  get  close  to

him.

my  sisters  yelled  their  fool  heads  off,
all  the  time  saying,  “poor  samie!  poor
samie!”

mama shushed them up and told me to
go  get  the  forked  stick  from  under  the
clothesline. i ran and got it.

mama  was  the  best  helper  a  boy  ever
had. she put the forked end over samie’s
neck and pinned him to the ground.

it  was  bad  enough  for  the  trap  to  be
biting his foot, but to have his neck pinned
down that way was too much. he threw a
fit.  i  never  heard  such  a  racket  in  all  my
life.

it  wasn’t  long  until  everything  on  the
place  was  all  spooked  up.  the  chickens
started  cackling  and  flew  way  up  on  the
hillside. daisy, our milk cow, all but tore

the  barn  lot  up  and  refused  to  give  any
milk  that  night.  sloppy  ann,  our  hog,
started  running  in  circles,  squealing  and
grunting.

samie wiggled and twisted. he yowled
and  spit,  but  it  didn’t  do  him  any  good.
mama  was  good  and  stout.  she  held  him
down, tight to the ground. i ran in and put
my  foot  on  the  trap  spring,  mashed  it
down,  and  released  his  foot.  with  one
loud squall, he scooted under the barn.

after  it  was  all  over,  mama  said,  “i
don’t  think  you’ll  have  any  more  trouble
with  that  cat.  i  think  he  has  learned  his
lesson.”

how wrong mama was. samie was one
of  those  nosy  kind  of  cats.  he  would  lie
up on the red oak limbs and watch every
move i made.

i found some slick little trails out in our
garden  down  under  some  tall  hollyhocks.
thinking  they  were  game  trails,  and  not
knowing
they  were  samie’s  favorite
hunting  trails,  i  set  my  traps.  samie
couldn’t understand what i was doing out
there, messing around his hunting territory.
he went to investigate.

it  wasn’t  long  until  i  had  him  limping
with  all  four  feet.  every  time  papa  saw
samie lying around in the warm sun with
his feet wrapped up in turpentine rags, he
would  laugh  until  big  tears  rolled  down
his cheeks.

mama had another talk with papa. she
to  say
said  he  was  going
something  to  me,  because  if  i  caught  that
cat one more time, it would drive her out
of her mind.

to  have

where i set my traps.

“papa,”  i  said,  “i  don’t  want  to  catch
samie, but he’s the craziest cat i ever saw.
he sees everything i do, and just has to go
sniffing around.”

papa  looked  over  at  samie.  he  was
lying all sprawled out in the sunshine with
all  four  paws  bandaged  and  sticking
straight up. his long tail was swishing this
way and that.

“you see, papa,” i said, “he’s watching
me right now, just waiting for me to set my
traps.”

papa told me to be a little more careful

papa  walked  off  toward  the  barn.  i

heard him laughing fit to kill.

it  finally  got  too  tough  for  samie.  he
left home. oh, he came in once in a while,
all  long  and  lean  looking,  but  he  never

was  the  same  friendly  cat  any  more.  he
was nervous and wouldn’t let anyone pet
him. he would gobble down his milk and
then scoot for the timber.

once  i  decided  to  make  friends  with
him because i felt bad about catching him
in my traps. i reached out my hand to rub
his back. he swelled up like a sitting hen.
his eyeballs got all green, and he growled
way down deep. he spat at me, and drew
back his paw like he was going to knock
my head off. i decided i’d better leave him
alone.

in no time at all i cleaned out the rats.
then  something  bad  happened.  i  caught
one  of  mama’s  prize  hens.  i  got  one  of
those  “young  man  peach  tree”  switchings
over that.

papa  told  me  to  go  down  in  the

canebrakes  back  of  our  fields  and  trap.
this opened up all kinds of new wonders.
i  caught  opossums,  skunks,  rabbits,  and
squirrels.

papa showed me how to skin my game.
in neat little rows i tacked the hides on the
smokehouse wall. i’d stand for hours and
admire my magnificent trophies.

there  was  only  one  thing  wrong.  i
didn’t  have  a  big  coonskin  to  add  to  my
collection.  i  couldn’t  trap  old  mister
ringtail.  he  was  too  smart  for  me.  he’d
steal  the  bait  from  the  traps,  spring  the
triggers,  and  sometimes  even  turn  them
over.

once  i  found  a  small  stick  standing
upright in one of my traps. i showed it to
papa. he laughed and said the stick must
have  fallen  from  a  tree.  it  made  no

the

difference  what  papa  said.  i  was  firmly
convinced  that  a  smart  old  coon  had
deliberately poked that stick in my trap.

traps  helped  my  dog-wanting
considerably,  but  like  a  new  toy,  the
newness  wore  off  and  i  was  right  back
where i started from. only this time it was
worse, much worse. i had been exposed to
the feel of wildlife.

i  started  pestering  mama  again.  she
said,  “oh,  no!  not  that  again.  i  thought
you’d  be  satisfied  with  the  traps.  no,
billy, i don’t want to hear any more about
hounds.”

i knew mama meant what she said. this
broke my heart. i decided i’d leave home.
i sneaked out a quart jar of peaches, some
cold  corn  bread,  and  a  few  onions,  and
started up the hollow back of our house. i

had  it  all  figured  out.  i’d  go  away  off  to
some  big  town,  get  a  hundred  dogs,  and
bring them all back with me.

i made it all right until i heard a timber
wolf  howl.  this  stopped  my  home-
leaving.

when  the  hunting  season  opened  that
fall,  something  happened  that  was  almost
more than i could stand. i was lying in bed
one night trying to figure out a way i could
get  some  dogs  when  i  heard  the  deep
baying  of  a  coon  hound.  i  got  up  and
opened  my  window.  it  came  again.  the
deep  voice  rang  loud  and  clear  in  the
frosty night. now and then i could hear the
hunter whooping to him.

the  hound  hunted  all  night.  he  quit
when  the  roosters  started  crowing  at
daybreak.  the  hunter  and
the  hound

weren’t  the  only  ones  awake  that  night.  i
stayed  up  and  listened  to  them  until  the
last tones of the hound’s voice died away
in the daylight hours.

that morning i was determined to have
some hounds. i went again to mama. this
time i tried bribery. i told her if she’d get
me  a  hunting  dog,  i’d  save  the  money  i
earned  from  my  furs,  and  buy  her  a  new
dress and a boxful of pretty hats.

that  time  i  saw  tears  in  her  eyes.  it
made me feel all empty inside and i cried
a little, too. by the time she was through
kissing me and talking to me, i was sure i
didn’t  need  any  dogs  at  all.  i  couldn’t
stand to see mama cry.

the next night i heard the hound again. i
tried  to  cover  my  head  with  a  pillow  to
shut  out  the  sound.  it  was  no  use.  his

voice seemed to bore its way through the
pillow and ring in my ears. i had to get up
and  again  go  to  the  window.  i’m  sure  if
that  coon  hunter  had  known  that  he  was
slowly  killing  a  ten-year-old  boy,  he
would have put a muzzle on his hound.

sleep was out of the question. even on
nights  when  i  couldn’t  hear  the  hound,  i
couldn’t  sleep.  i  was  afraid  if  i  did,  he
would  come  and  i  would  miss  hearing
him.

by the time hunting season was over, i
was a nervous wreck. my eyes were red
and bloodshot. i had lost weight and was
as thin as a bean pole. mama checked me
over. she looked at my tongue and turned
back one of my eyelids.

“if i didn’t know better,” she said, “i’d
swear  you  weren’t  sleeping  well.  are

you?”

“why,  mama,”  i  said,  “i  go  to  bed,
don’t i? what does a boy go to bed for if it
isn’t to sleep?”

by  the  little  wrinkles  that  bunched  up
on  her  forehead,  i  could  tell  that  mama
wasn’t satisfied. papa came in during one
of  these  inspections.  mama  told  him  she
was worried about my health.

“aw,”  he  said,  “there’s  nothing  wrong
with  him.  it’s  just  because  he’s  been
cooped  up  all  winter.  a  boy  needs
sunshine,  and  exercise.  he’s  almost
eleven now, and i’m going to let him help
me in the fields this summer. that will put
the muscles back on him.”

i thought this was wonderful. i’d finally
grown up to be a man. i was going to help
papa with the farm.

iii

the  dog-wanting  disease  never  did  leave  me
altogether.  with  the  new  work  i  was
doing, helping papa, it just kind of burned
itself  down  and  left  a  big  sore  on  my
heart.  every  time  i’d  see  a  coon  track
down
the
riverbanks,  the  old  sore  would  get  all
festered up and start hurting again.

fields,  or  along

in  our

just  when  i  had  given  up  all  hope  of
ever  owning  a  good  hound,  something
wonderful  happened.  the  good  lord
figured i had hurt enough, and it was time
to lend a helping hand.

it all started one day while i was hoeing
corn down in our field close to the river.

across the river, a party of fishermen had
been camped for several days. i heard the
old maxwell car as it snorted and chugged
its  way  out  of  the  bottoms.  i  knew  they
were  leaving.  throwing  down  my  hoe,  i
ran down to the river and waded across at
a place called the shannon ford. i hurried
to the campground.

it  was  always  a  pleasure  to  prowl
where  fishermen  had  camped.  i  usually
could find things: a fish line, or a forgotten
fish  pole.  on  one  occasion,  i  found  a
beautiful  knife  stuck  in  the  bark  of  a
sycamore  tree,  forgotten  by  a  careless
fisherman.  but  on  that  day,  i  found  the
greatest  of
treasures,  a  sportsman’s
magazine,  discarded  by  the  campers.  it
was  a  real  treasure  for  a  country  boy.
because  of  that  magazine,  my  entire  life

section—“dogs

i sat down on an old sycamore log, and
started  thumbing  through  the  leaves.  on
the back pages of the magazine, i came to
the  “for  sale”
for
sale”—every  kind  of  dog.  i  read  on  and
on.  they  had  dogs  i  had  never  heard  of,
names  i  couldn’t  make  out.  far  down  in
the  right-hand  corner,  i  found  an  ad  that
took  my  breath  away.  in  small  letters,  it
read:  “registered  redbone  coon  hound
pups—twenty-five dollars each.”

was changed.

the advertisement was from a kennel in
kentucky. i read it over and over. by the
time i had memorized the ad, i was seeing
dogs, hearing dogs, and even feeling them.
the magazine was forgotten. i was lost in
thought.  the  brain  of  an  eleven-year-old
boy can dream some fantastic dreams.

how  wonderful  it  would  be  if  i  could
have two of those pups. every boy in the
country but me had a good hound or two.
but  fifty  dollars—how  could  i  ever  get
fifty dollars? i knew i couldn’t expect help
from mama and papa.

i remembered a passage from the bible
my  mother  had  read  to  us:  “god  helps
those  who  help  themselves.”  i  thought  of
the words. i mulled them over in my mind.
i  decided  i’d  ask  god  to  help  me.  there
on  the  banks  of  the  illinois  river,  in  the
cool  shade  of  the  tall  white  sycamores,  i
asked god to help me get two hound pups.
it wasn’t much of a prayer, but it did come
right from the heart.

when  i  left  the  campground  of  the
fishermen, it was late. as i walked along,
i could feel the hard bulge of the magazine

jammed deep in the pocket of my overalls.
the  beautiful  silence  that  follows  the
setting  sun  had  settled  over  the  river
bottoms.  the  coolness  of  the  rich,  black
soil felt good to my bare feet.

stared  at  me,  and

it was the time of day when all furried
things  come  to  life. a  big  swamp  rabbit
hopped  out  on  the  trail,  sat  on  his
haunches,
then
scampered  away. a  mother  gray  squirrel
ran out on the limb of a burr oak tree. she
barked  a  warning  to  the  four  furry  balls
behind her. they melted from sight in the
thick green. a silent gray shadow drifted
down  from  the  top  of  a  tall  sycamore.
there  was  a  squeal  and  a  beating  of
wings.  i  heard  the  tinkle  of  a  bell  in  the
distance ahead. i knew it was daisy, our
milk cow. i’d have to start her on the way

home.

i took the magazine from my pocket and
again i read the ad. slowly a plan began to
form. i’d save the money. i could sell stuff
to the fishermen: crawfish, minnows, and
fresh vegetables. in berry season, i could
sell  all  the  berries  i  could  pick  at  my
grandfather’s  store.  i  could  trap  in  the
winter. the more i planned, the more real
it became. there was the way to get those
pups—save my money.

i  could  almost  feel  the  pups  in  my
hands.  i  planned  the  little  doghouse,  and
where  to  put  it.  collars  i  could  make
myself.  then  the  thought  came,  “what
could  i  name  them?”  i  tried  name  after
name,  voicing
loud.  none
seemed to fit. well, there would be plenty
of time for names.

them  out

right  now  there  was  something  more
important—fifty  dollars—a  fabulous  sum
—a  fortune—far  more  money  than  i  had
ever  seen.  somehow,  some  way,  i  was
determined  to  have  it.  i  had  twenty-three
cents—a  dime  i  had  earned  running
errands for my grandpa, and thirteen cents
a  fisherman  had  given  me  for  a  can  of
worms.

the  next  morning  i  went  to  the  trash
pile behind the barn. i was looking for a
can—my  bank.  i  picked  up  several,  but
they  didn’t  seem  to  be  what  i  wanted.
then i saw it, an old k. c. baking powder
can. it was perfect, long and slender, with
a good tight lid. i took it down to the creek
and  scrubbed  it  with  sand  until  it  was
bright and new-looking.

i dropped the twenty-three cents in the

can. the coins looked so small lying there
on  the  shiny  bottom,  but  to  me  it  was  a
good  start.  with  my  finger,  i  tried  to
measure  how  full  it  would  be  with  fifty
dollars in it.

next,  i  went  to  the  barn  and  up  in  the
loft.  far  back  over  the  hay  and  up  under
the  eaves,  i  hid  my  can.  i  had  a  start
toward  making  my  dreams  come  true—
twenty-three cents. i had a good bank, safe
from the rats and from the rain and snow.
all through that summer i worked like a
beaver. in the small creek that wormed its
way  down  through  our  fields,  i  caught
crawfish  with  my  bare  hands.  i  trapped
minnows  with  an  old  screen-wire  trap  i
made  myself,  baited  with  yellow  corn
bread  from  my  mother’s  kitchen.  these
were  sold  to  the  fishermen,  along  with

fresh  vegetables  and  roasting  ears.  i  tore
my  way  through  the  blackberry  patches
until  my  hands  and  feet  were  scratched
raw and red from the thorns. i tramped the
hills  seeking  out  the  huckleberry  bushes.
my grandfather paid me ten cents a bucket
for my berries.

once  grandpa  asked  me  what  i  did
with the money i earned. i told him i was
saving it to buy some hunting dogs. i asked
him if he would order them for me when i
had  saved  enough.  he  said  he  would.  i
asked him not to say anything to my father.
he  promised  me  he  wouldn’t.  i’m  sure
grandpa paid little attention to my plans.

the

that  winter  i  trapped  harder  than  ever
with
traps  i  owned.
grandpa sold my hides to fur buyers who
came  to  his  store  all  through  the  fur

three

little

season.  prices  were  cheap:  fifteen  cents
for a large opossum hide, twenty-five for
a good skunk hide.

little  by  little,  the  nickels  and  dimes
added  up.  the  old  k.  c.  baking  powder
can grew heavy. i would heft its weight in
the  palm  of  my  hand.  with  a  straw,  i’d
measure  from  the  lip  of  the  can  to  the
money. as the months went by, the straws
grew shorter and shorter.

the  next  summer  i  followed  the  same

routine.

“would you like to buy some crawfish
or minnows? maybe you’d like some fresh
vegetables or roasting ears.”

the fishermen were wonderful, as true
sportsmen  are.  they  seemed  to  sense  the
urgency  in  my  voice  and  always  bought
my  wares.  however,  many  was  the  time

a  year  passed.  i  was  twelve.  i  was
over the halfway mark. i had twenty-seven
dollars  and  forty-six  cents.  my  spirits
soared. i worked harder.

another  year  crawled  slowly  by,  and
then  the  great  day  came.  the  long  hard
grind was over. i had it—my fifty dollars!
i cried as i counted it over and over.

as  i  set  the  can  back  in  the  shadowy
eaves of the barn, it seemed to glow with
a  radiant  whiteness  i  had  never  seen
before.  perhaps  it  was  all  imagination.  i
don’t know.

lying back in the soft hay, i folded my
hands  behind  my  head,  closed  my  eyes,

and let my mind wander back over the two
long years. i thought of the fishermen, the
blackberry  patches,  and  the  huckleberry
hills.  i  thought  of  the  prayer  i  had  said
when  i  asked  god  to  help  me  get  two
hound pups. i knew he had surely helped,
for  he  had  given  me  the  heart,  courage,
and determination.

early  the  next  morning,  with  the  can
jammed deep in the pocket of my overalls,
i  flew  to  the  store.  as  i  trotted  along,  i
whistled  and  sang.  i  felt  as  big  as  the
tallest mountain in the ozarks.

arriving  at  my  destination,  i  saw  two
wagons were tied up at the hitching rack. i
knew some farmers had come to the store,
so i waited until they left. as i walked in,
i  saw  my  grandfather  behind  the  counter.
tugging and pulling, i worked the can out

of my pocket and dumped it out in front of
him and looked up.

grandpa was dumbfounded. he tried to
say  something,  but  it  wouldn’t  come  out.
he looked at me, and he looked at the pile
of coins. finally, in a voice much louder
than he ordinarily used, he asked, “where
did you get all this?”

“i  told  you,  grandpa,”  i  said,  “i  was
saving  my  money  so  i  could  buy  two
hound  pups,  and  i  did.  you  said  you
would  order  them  for  me.  i’ve  got  the
money and now i want you to order them.”
grandpa stared at me over his glasses,

and then back at the money.

“how long have you been saving this?”

he asked.

“a long time, grandpa,” i said.
“how long?” he asked.

i told him, “two years.”
his  mouth  flew  open  and  in  a  loud

voice he said, “two years!”

i nodded my head.
the  way  my  grandfather  stared  at  me
made  me  uneasy.  i  was  on  needles  and
pins. taking his eyes from me, he glanced
back  at  the  money.  he  saw  the  faded
yellow  piece  of  paper  sticking  out  from
the coins. he worked it out, asking as he
did, “what’s this?”

i told him it was the ad, telling where to

order my dogs.

at the other side.

he read it, turned it over, and glanced

the

and
come back. i felt much better.

dropping the paper back on the money,

he turned, picked up an old turkey-feather
duster,  and  started  dusting  where  there
was no dust. he kept glancing at me out of
the corner of his eye as he walked slowly
down to the other end of the store, dusting
here and there.

he  put  the  duster  down,  came  from
behind the counter, and walked up to me.
laying a friendly old work-calloused hand
on  my  head,  he  changed  the  conversation
altogether,  saying,  “son,  you  need  a
haircut.”

i told him i didn’t mind. i didn’t like my
hair  short;  flies  and  mosquitoes  bothered
me.

he  glanced  down  at  my  bare  feet  and
asked,  “how  come  your  feet  are  cut  and
scratched like that?”

i  told  him  it  was  pretty  tough  picking

blackberries barefoot.
he nodded his head.
it was too much for my grandfather. he
turned and walked away. i saw the glasses
come  off,  and  the  old  red  handkerchief
come  out.  i  heard  the  good  excuse  of
blowing  his  nose.  he  stood  for  several
seconds  with  his  back  toward  me.  when
he turned around, i noticed his eyes were
moist.

he  walked  over  and  picked  up  the  ad

in  a  quavering  voice,  he  said,  “well,
son, it’s your money. you worked for it,
and you worked hard. you got it honestly,
and you want some dogs. we’re going to
get those dogs. be damned! be damned!”

that  was  as  near  as  i  ever  came  to
hearing  my  grandfather  curse,  if  you  can
call it cursing.

again, asking, “is this two years old, too?”

i nodded.
“well,” he said, “the first thing we have
to  do  is  write  this  outfit.  there  may  not
even be a place like this in kentucky any
more. after all, a lot of things can happen
in two years.”

seeing  that  i  was  worried,  he  said,
“now you go on home. i’ll write to these
kennels  and  i’ll  let  you  know  when  i  get
an answer. if we can’t get the dogs there,
we  can  get  them  someplace  else.  and  i
don’t  think,  if  i  were  you,  i’d  let  my  pa
know  anything  about  this  right  now.  i
happen  to  know  he  wants  to  buy  that  red
mule from old man potter.”

i  told  him  i  wouldn’t,  and  turned  to

leave the store.

as  i  reached  the  door,  my  grandfather

said in a loud voice, “say, it’s been a long
time  since  you’ve  had  any  candy,  hasn’t
it?”

i nodded my head.
he asked, “how long?”
i told him, “a long time.”
“well,”  he  said,  “we’ll  have  to  do

something about that.”

walking  over  behind  the  counter,  he
reached  out  and  got  a  sack.  i  noticed  it
wasn’t one of the nickel sacks. it was one
of the quarter kind.

my  eyes  never  left  my  grandfather’s
hand. time after time, it dipped in and out
of  the  candy  counter:  peppermint  sticks,
jawbreakers,  horehound,  and  gumdrops.
the sack bulged. so did my eyes.

handing the sack to me, he said, “here.
first big coon you catch with those dogs,

you can pay me back.”
i told him i would.
on my way home, with a jawbreaker in
one  side  of  my  mouth  and  a  piece  of
horehound  in  the  other,  i  skipped  and
hopped,  making  half  an  effort  to  try  to
whistle  and  sing,  and  couldn’t  for  the
candy.  i  had  the  finest  grandpa  in  the
world  and  i  was  the  happiest  boy  in  the
world.

i wanted to share my happiness with my
sisters  but  decided  not  to  say  anything
about ordering the pups.

arriving  home,  i  dumped  the  sack  of
candy  out  on  the  bed.  six  little  hands
helped  themselves.  i  was  well  repaid  by
the love and adoration i saw in the wide
blue eyes of my three little sisters.

iv

day  after  day,  i  flew  to  the  store,  grandpa
would shake his head. then on a monday,
as i entered the store, i sensed a change in
him.  he  was  in  high  spirits,  talking  and
laughing with half a dozen farmers. every
time i caught his eye, he would smile and
wink  at  me.  i  thought  the  farmers  would
never  leave,  but  finally  the  store  was
empty.

grandpa  told  me  the  letter  had  come.
the kennels were still there, and they had
dogs  for  sale.  he  said  he  had  made  the
mail  buggy  wait  while  he  made  out  the
order. and, another thing, the dog market
had gone downhill. the price of dogs had

dropped five dollars. he handed me a ten-
dollar bill.

“now,  there’s  still  one  stump  in  the
way,”  he  said.  “the  mail  buggy  can’t
carry things like dogs, so they’ll come as
far  as  the  depot  at  tahlequah,  but  you’ll
get the notice here because i ordered them
in your name.”

i  thanked  my  grandfather  with  all  my
heart and asked him how long i’d have to
wait for the notice.

he said, “i don’t know, but it shouldn’t

take more than a couple of weeks.”

i asked how i was going to get my dogs

out from tahlequah.

“well,  there’s  always  someone  going
in,” he said, “and you could ride in with
them.”

that  evening  the  silence  of  our  supper

was  interrupted  when  i  asked  my  father
this  question:  “papa,  how  far  is  it  to
kentucky?”

i  may  as  well  have  exploded  a  bomb.
for an instant there was complete silence,
and then my oldest sister giggled. the two
little ones stared at me.

with  a  half-hearted  laugh,  my  father
said, “well, now, i don’t know, but it’s a
pretty  good  ways.  what  do  you  want  to
know  for?  thinking  of  taking  a  trip  to
kentucky?”

“no,” i said. “i just wondered.”
my  youngest  sister  giggled  and  asked,

“can i go with you?”

i glared at her.
mama  broke  into  the  conversation,  “i
declare,  what  kind  of  a  question  is  that?
how  far  is  it  to  kentucky?  i  don’t  know

what’s  gotten  into  that  mind  of  yours
lately. you go around like you were lost,
and  you’re  losing  weight.  you’re  as
skinny as a rail, and look at that hair. just
last sunday they had a haircutting over at
tom rolland’s place, but you couldn’t go.
you  had  to  go  prowling  around  the  river
and the woods.”

i  told  mama  that  i’d  get  a  haircut  next
time  they  had  a  cutting. and  i  just  heard
some fellows talking about kentucky up at
the  store,  and  wondered  how  far  away  it
was. much to my relief, the conversation
was ended.

the  days  dragged  by.  a  week  passed
and still no word about my dogs. terrible
thoughts ran through my mind. maybe my
dogs  were  lost;  the  train  had  a  wreck;
someone  stole  my  money;  or  perhaps  the

mailman lost my order. then, at the end of
the second week, the notice came.

my  grandfather  told  me  that  he  had
talked  to  jim  hodges  that  day.  he  was
going  into  town  in  about  a  week  and  i
could ride in with him to pick up my dogs.
again i thanked my grandfather.

i  started  for  home.  walking  along  in
deep thought, i decided it was time to tell
my father the whole story. i fully intended
to  tell  him  that  evening.  i  tried  several
times,  but  somehow  i  couldn’t.  i  wasn’t
scared of him, for he never whipped me.
he  was  always  kind  and  gentle,  but  for
some  reason,  i  don’t  know  why,  i  just
couldn’t tell him.

that  night,  snuggled  deep  in  the  soft
folds of a feather bed, i lay thinking. i had
waited  so  long  for  my  dogs,  and  i  so

desperately  wanted  to  see  them  and  hold
them. i didn’t want to wait a whole week.
in  a  flash  i  made  up  my  mind.  very
quietly  i  got  up  and  put  on  my  clothes.  i
sneaked  into  the  kitchen  and  got  one  of
mama’s  precious  flour  sacks.  in  it  i  put
six eggs, some leftover corn bread, a little
salt, and a few matches. next i went to the
smokehouse  and  cut  off  a  piece  of  salt
pork. i stopped at the barn and picked up a
gunny sack. i put the flour sack inside the
gunny sack. this i rolled up and crammed
lengthwise in the bib of my overalls.

i was on my way. i was going after my

dogs.

tahlequah  was  a  small  country  town
with a population of about eight hundred.
by the road it was thirty-two miles away,
but  as  the  crow  flies,  it  was  only  twenty

miles.  i  went  as  the  crow  flies,  straight
through the hills.

although  i  had  never  been  to  town  in
my  life,  i  knew  what  direction  to  take.
tahlequah  and  the  railroad  lay  on  the
other  side  of  the  river  from  our  place.  i
had  the  frisco  railroad  on  my  right,  and
the illinois river on my left. not far from
where  the  railroad  crossed  the  river  lay
the town of tahlequah. i knew if i bore to
the right i would find the railroad, and if i
bore to the left i had the river to guide me.
some time that night, i crossed the river
on  a  riffle  somewhere  in  the  dripping
springs  country.  coming  out  of  the  river
bottoms, i scatted up a long hogback ridge,
and broke out on top in the flats. in a mile-
eating trot, i moved along. i had the wind
of a deer, the muscles of a country boy, a

heart  full  of  dog  love,  and  a  strong
determination.  i  wasn’t  scared  of  the
darkness,  or  the  mountains,  for  i  was
raised in those mountains.

on  and  on,  mile  after  mile,  i  moved
along.  i  saw  faint  gray  streaks  appear  in
the  east.  i  knew  daylight  was  close.  my
bare  feet  were  getting  sore  from  the  flint
rocks and saw briers. i stopped beside a
mountain  stream,  soaked  my  feet  in  the
cool  water,  rested  for  a  spell,  and  then
started on.

after  leaving  the  mountain  stream,  my
pace  was  much  slower.  the  muscles  of
my  legs  were  getting  stiff.  feeling  the
pangs of hunger gnawing at my stomach, i
decided  i  would  stop  and  eat  at  the  next
stream i found. then i remembered i had
forgotten to include a can in which to boil

my eggs.

i stopped and built a small fire. cutting
off a nice thick slab of salt pork, i roasted
it,  and  with  a  piece  of  cold  corn  bread
made  a  sandwich.  putting  out  my  fire,  i
was  on  my  way  again.  i  ate  as  i  trotted
along. i felt much better.

i  came

into  tahlequah

the
northeast.  at  the  outskirts  of  town,  i  hid
my flour sack and provisions, keeping the
gunny sack. i walked into town.

from

i  was  scared  of  tahlequah  and  the
people. i had never seen such a big town
and so many people. there was store after
store, some of them two stories high. the
wagon yard had wagons on top of wagons;
teams, buggies, and horses.

two  young

ladies  about  my  age
stopped,  stared  at  me,  and  then  giggled.

my blood boiled, but i could understand.
after all, i had three sisters. they couldn’t
help  it  because  they  were  womenfolks.  i
went on.

i  saw  a  big  man  coming  up  the  street.
the bright shiny star on his vest looked as
big as a bucket. i saw the long, black gun
at  his  side  and  i  froze  in  my  tracks.  i’d
heard  of  sheriffs  and  marshals,  but  had
never  seen  one.  stories  repeated  about
them  in  the  mountains  told  how  fast  they
were with a gun, and how many men they
had killed.

the closer he came, the more frightened
i got. i knew it was the end for me. i could
just see him aiming his big, black gun and
shooting  me  between  the  eyes.  it  seemed
like  a  miracle  that  he  passed  by,  hardly
glancing at me. breathing a sigh, i walked

passing a large store window, i stopped
and stared. there in the window was the
most  wonderful  sight  i  had  ever  seen;
everything under the sun; overalls, jackets,
bolts  of  beautiful  cloth,  new  harnesses,
collars, bridles; and then my eyes did pop
open. there were several guns and one of
them had two barrels. i couldn’t believe it
—two  barrels.  i  had  seen  several  guns,
but never one with two barrels.

then i saw something else. the sun was
just right, and the plate glass was a perfect
mirror. i saw the full reflection of myself
for the first time in my life.

on, seeing the wonders of the world.

i could see that i did look a little odd.
my  straw-colored  hair  was  long  and
shaggy,  and  was  bushed  out  like  a  corn
tassle that had been hit by a wind. i tried

to  smooth  it  down  with  my  hands.  this
helped some but not much. what it needed
was a good combing and i had no comb.

my  overalls  were  patched  and  faded
but  they  were  clean.  my  shirt  had  pulled
out. i tucked it back in.

i  took  one  look  at  my  bare  feet  and
winced.  they  were  as  brown  as  dead
sycamore leaves. the spider-web pattern
of  raw,  red  scratches  looked  odd  in  the
saddle-brown  skin.  i  thought,  “well,  i
won’t have to pick any more blackberries
and the scratches will soon go away.”

i pumped up one of my arms and thought
surely  the  muscle  was  going  to  pop  right
through my thin blue shirt. i stuck out my
tongue.  it  was  as  red  as  pokeberry  juice
and  anything  that  color  was  supposed  to
be healthy.

after  making  a  few  faces  at  myself,  i
put my thumbs in my ears and was making
mule ears when two old women came by.
they  stopped  and  stared  at  me.  i  stared
back. as they turned to go on their way, i
heard  one  of  them  say  something  to  the
other. the words were hard to catch, but i
did  hear  one  word:  “wild.”  as  i  said
before,  they  couldn’t  help  it,  they  were
womenfolks.

as i turned to leave, my eyes again fell
on  the  overalls  and  the  bolts  of  cloth.  i
thought  of  my  mother,  father,  and  sisters.
here was an opportunity to make amends
for leaving home without telling anyone.

i  entered  the  store.  i  bought  a  pair  of
overalls  for  papa.  after
the
storekeeper  how  big  my  mother  and
sisters  were,  i  bought  several  yards  of

telling

cloth. i also bought a large sack of candy.
glancing  down  at  my  bare  feet,  the
storekeeper  said,  “i  have  some  good
shoes.”

i told him i didn’t need any shoes.
he asked if that would be all.
i nodded.
he added up the bill. i handed him my

ten dollars. he gave me my change.

after  wrapping  up  the  bundles,  he
helped me put them in my sack. lifting it
to my shoulder, i turned and left the store.
out  on  the  street,  i  picked  out  a
friendly-looking  old  man  and  asked  him
where  the  depot  was.  he  told  me  to  go
down to the last street and turn right, go as
far  as  i  could,  and  i  couldn’t  miss  it.  i
thanked him and started on my way.

leaving the main part of town, i started

up  a  long  street  through  the  residential
section.  i  had  never  seen  so  many
beautiful  houses,  and
they  were  all
different colors. the lawns were neat and
clean and looked like green carpets. i saw
a  man  pushing  some  kind  of  a  mowing
machine.  i  stopped  to  watch  the  whirling
blades. he gawked at me. i hurried on.

i  heard  a  lot  of  shouting  and  laughing
to  miss
ahead  of  me.  not  wanting
anything,  i  walked  a  little  faster.  i  saw
what  was  making  the  noise.  more  kids
than i had ever seen were playing around
a  big  red  brick  building.  i  thought  some
rich  man  lived  there  and  was  giving  a
party  for  his  children.  walking  up  to  the
edge  of  the  playground,  i  stopped  to
watch.

the boys and girls were about my age,

and  were  as  thick  as  flies  around  a
sorghum mill. they were milling, running,
and  jumping.  teeter-totters  and  swings
were  loaded  down  with  them.  everyone
was laughing and having a big time.

over against the building, a large blue
pipe ran up on an angle from the ground. a
few feet from the top there was a bend in
it.  the  pipe  seemed  to  go  into  the
building. boys were crawling into its dark
mouth.  i  counted  nine  of  them.  one  boy
stood about six feet from the opening with
a stick in his hand.

staring goggle-eyed, trying to figure out
what they were doing, i got a surprise. out
of  the  hollow  pipe  spurted  a  boy.  he
sailed  through  the  air  and  lit  on  his  feet.
the boy with the stick marked the ground
where  he  landed. all  nine  of  them  came

shooting  out,  one  behind  the  other.  as
each  boy
landed,  a  new  mark  was
scratched.

they  ganged  around  looking  at  the
lines.  there  was  a  lot  of  loud  talking,
pointing, and arguing. then all lines were
erased and a new scorekeeper was picked
out.  the  others  crawled  back  into  the
pipe.

i figured out how the game was played.
after climbing to the top of the slide, the
boys turned around and sat down. one at a
time, they came flying down and out, feet
first. the one that shot out the furthest was
the  winner.  i  thought  how  wonderful  it
would  be  if  i  could  slide  down  just  one
time.

one  boy,  spying  me  standing  on  the
corner,  came  over.  looking  me  up  and

down,  he  asked,  “do  you  go  to  school
here?”

i said, “school?”
he  said,  “sure.  school.  what  did  you

think it was?”

“oh. no, i don’t go to school here.”
“do you go to jefferson?”
“no. i don’t go there either.”
“don’t you go to school at all?”
“sure i go to school.”
“where?”
“at home.”
“you go to school at home?”
i nodded.
“what grade are you in?”
i said i wasn’t in any grade.
puzzled, he said, “you go to school at
home, and don’t know what grade you’re
in. who teaches you?”

“my mother.”
“what does she teach you?”
i

said,

“reading,  writing,

and
arithmetic, and i bet i’m just as good at it
as you are.”

he asked, “don’t you have any shoes?”
i said, “sure, i have shoes.”
“why aren’t you wearing them?”
“i don’t wear shoes until it gets cold.”
he laughed and asked where i lived.
i said, “back in the hills.”
he said, “oh, you’re a hillbilly.”
he  ran  back  to  the  mob.  i  saw  him
pointing at me and talking to several boys.
they  started  my  way,  yelling,  “hillbilly,
hillbilly.”

just  before  they  reached  me,  a  bell
started  ringing.  turning,  they  ran  to  the
front of the building, lined up in two long

lines, and marching like little tin soldiers
disappeared inside the school.

the  playground  was  silent.  i  was  all

alone, and felt lonely and sad.

i  heard  a  noise  on  my  right.  i  didn’t
have  to  turn  around  to  recognize  what  it
was. someone was using a hoe. i’d know
that sound if i heard it on a dark night. it
was  a  little  old  white-headed  woman
working in a flower bed.

looking  again  at  the  long,  blue  pipe,  i
thought, “there’s no one around. maybe i
could have one slide anyway.”

i eased over and looked up into the dark
hollow. it looked scary, but i thought of all
the  other  boys  i  had  seen  crawl  into  it.  i
could see the last mark on the ground, and
thought, “i bet i can beat that.”
laying  my  sack  down,

i  started

climbing up. the farther i went, the darker
and more scary it got. just as i reached the
top,  my  feet  slipped.  down  i  sailed. all
the  way  down  i  tried  to  grab  on  to
something, but there was nothing to grab.

as i started down, i shut my eyes tight

i’m sure some great champions had slid
out  of  that  pipe,  and  no  doubt  more  than
one world record had been broken, but if
someone had been there when i came out,
i know the record i set would stand today
in all its glory.

i came out just like i went in, feet first
and belly down. my legs were spread out
like a bean-shooter stalk. arms flailing the
air, i zoomed out and up. i seemed to hang
suspended in air at the peak of my climb. i
could  see  the  hard-packed  ground  far
below.

and  gritted  my  teeth.  this  didn’t  seem  to
help. with a splattering sound, i landed. i
felt the air whoosh out between my teeth. i
tried  to  scream,  but  had  no  wind  left  to
make a sound.

after  bouncing  a  couple  of  times,  i
finally settled down to earth. i lay spread-
eagled for a few seconds, and then slowly
got to my knees.

hearing loud laughter, i looked around.
it  was  the  little  old  lady  with  the  hoe  in
her  hand.  she  hollered  and  asked  how  i
liked it. without answering, i grabbed up
my gunny sack and left. far up the street, i
looked  back.  the  little  old  lady  was
sitting down, rocking with laughter.
these

town
people. if they weren’t staring at a fellow,
they were laughing at him.

i  couldn’t  understand

v

on arriving at the depot, my nerve failed me. i
was afraid to go in. i didn’t know what i
was scared of, but i was scared.

before  going  around  to  the  front,  i
peeked  in  a  window.  the  stationmaster
was in his office looking at some papers.
he was wearing a funny little cap that had
no top in it. he looked friendly enough but
i  still  couldn’t  muster  up  enough  courage
to go in.

i  cocked  my  ear  to  see  if  i  could  hear
puppies crying, but could hear nothing. a
bird  started  chirping.  it  was  a  yellow
canary
in  a  cage.  the  stationmaster
walked  over  and  gave  it  some  water.  i

thought,  “anyone  that  is  kind  to  birds
surely wouldn’t be mean to a boy.”

with  my  courage  built  up  i  walked
around to the front and eased myself past
the  office.  he  glanced  at  me  and  turned
back to the papers. i walked clear around
the  depot  and  again  walked  slowly  past
the office. glancing from the corner of my
eye, i saw the stationmaster looking at me
and smiling. he opened the door and came
out on the platform. i stopped and leaned
against the building.

yawning  and  stretching  his  arms,  he
said, “it sure is hot today. it doesn’t look
like it’s ever going to rain.”

i  looked  up  at  the  sky  and  said,  “yes,
sir. it is hot and we sure could do with a
good  rain.  we  need  one  bad  up  where  i
come from.”

he asked me where i lived.
i told him, “up the river a ways.”
“you  know,”  he  said,  “i  have  some
puppies in there for a boy that lives up on
the  river.  his  name  is  billy  colman.  i
know  his  dad,  but  never  have  seen  the
boy.  i  figured  he  would  be  in  after  them
today.”

on  hearing

this  remark,  my  heart
jumped  clear  up  in  my  throat.  i  thought
surely it was going to hop right out on the
depot  platform.  i  looked  up  and  tried  to
tell  him  who  i  was,  but  something  went
wrong.  when  the  words  finally  came  out
they  sounded  like  the  squeaky  old  pulley
on our well when mama drew up a bucket
of water.

i  could

stationmaster’s  eyes.  he  came  over  and

voice  he  said,  “so  you’re  billy  colman.
how is your dad?”

i  told  him  papa  was  fine  and  handed

him the slip my grandpa had given me.

“they  sure  are  fine-looking  pups,”  he
said.  “you’ll  have  to  go  around  to  the
freight door.”

i’m  sure  my  feet  never  touched  the
ground  as  i  flew  around  the  building.  he
unlocked  the  door,  and  i  stepped  in,
looking  for  my  dogs.  i  couldn’t  see
anything  but  boxes,  barrels,  old  trunks,
and some rolls of barbed wire.

the  kindly  stationmaster  walked  over

to one of the boxes.

“do you want box and all?” he asked.
i  told  him  i  didn’t  want  the  box. all  i

wanted was the dogs.

“how are you going to carry them?” he
asked. “i think they’re a little too young to
follow.”

i held out my gunny sack.
he looked at me and looked at the sack.
chuckling,  he  said,  “well,  i  guess  dogs
can be carried that way same as anything
else,  but  we’ll  have  to  cut  a  couple  of
holes  to  stick  their  heads  through  so  that
they won’t smother.”

getting  a  claw  hammer,  he  started
tearing  off  the  top  of  the  box.  as  nails
gave  way  and  boards  splintered,  i  heard
several  puppy  whimpers.  i  didn’t  walk
over. i just stood and waited.

after  what  seemed  like  hours,  the  box
was  open.  he  reached  in,  lifted  the  pups
out, and set them down on the floor.

“well,  there  they  are,”  he  said.  “what

do you think of them?”

i didn’t answer. i couldn’t. all i could

do was stare at them.

they seemed to be blinded by the light
and kept blinking their eyes. one sat down
on  his  little  rear  and  started  crying.  the
other  one  was  waddling  around  and
whimpering.

i wanted so much to step over and pick
them up. several times i tried to move my
feet,  but  they  seemed  to  be  nailed  to  the
floor.  i  knew  the  pups  were  mine,  all
mine,  yet  i  couldn’t  move.  my  heart
started  acting  like  a  drunk  grasshopper.  i
tried
to  swallow  and  couldn’t.  my
adam’s apple wouldn’t work.

one  pup  started  my  way.  i  held  my
breath. on he came until i felt a scratchy
little  foot  on  mine.  the  other  pup

followed. a warm puppy tongue caressed
my sore foot.

i  heard  the  stationmaster  say,  “they

already know you.”

i  knelt  down  and  gathered  them  in  my
arms.  i  buried  my  face  between  their

stationmaster,  sensing  something  more
than  just  two  dogs  and  a  boy,  waited  in
silence.

bodies

and

rising with the two pups held close to

my chest, i asked if i owed anything.

he said, “there is a small feed bill but
i’ll take care of it. it’s not much anyway.”
taking his knife he cut two slits in the
sack.  he  put  the  pups  in  it  and  worked
their  heads  through  the  holes.  as  he
handed  the  sack  to  me,  he  said,  “well,
there  you  are.  good-bye  and  good

hunting!”

walking down the street toward town, i
thought,  “now,  maybe  the  people  won’t
stare  at  me  when  they  see  what  i’ve  got.
after  all,  not  every  boy  owns  two  good
hounds.”

turning the corner onto the main street,

i threw out my chest.

i

i  hadn’t  gone  far  before  i  realized  that
the reception i got wasn’t what i thought it
would be. people began to stop and stare,

understand why they were staring. surely
it  couldn’t  be  at  the  two  beautiful  hound
pups sticking out of the gunny sack.

snickered.

even

thinking that maybe i had a hole in the
seat  of  my  britches,  i  looked  over  to  my
reflection
in  a  plateglass  window.  i
craned  my  neck  for  a  better  view  of  my

rear.  i  could  see  a  patch  there  all  right,
and  a  few
threadbare  spots,  but  no
whiteness was showing through. i figured
that the people were just jealous because
they didn’t have two good hounds.

i  saw  a  drunk  coming.  he  was
staggering  all  over  the  street.  just  as  he
was  passing  me  i  heard  him  stop.  as  i
looked  back  i  saw  he  was  staring  wide-
eyed  at  my  sack.  closing  his  eyes,  he
rubbed them with his hands. opening them
again  he  stared.  shaking  his  head,  he
staggered on down the street.

all  around  people  began  to  roar  with
laughter.  someone  shouted,  “what’s  the
matter, john? you seeing things today?”

i hurried on, wanting to get away from

the stares and the snickers.

it  wouldn’t  have  happened  again  in  a

hundred  years,  but  there  they  came.  the
same  two  old  women  i  had  met  before.
we stopped and had another glaring fight.

all  around  me  people  began  to  shout
questions and laugh. one wanted to know

one said, “i declare.”
the other one snorted, “well, i never.”
my  face  burned.  i  couldn’t  take  any
more. after all, a man can stand so much
and no more. in a loud voice, i said, “you
may  have  these  people  fooled  with  those
expensive-looking  feathers  in  your  hats,
but  i  know  what  they  are.  they’re  goose
feathers painted with iodine.”

one  started  to  say  something,  but  her
words  were  drowned  out  by  the  roaring
laughter  from  all  around.  gathering  up
their long skirts, they swished on down the
street.

i  had

the  mother

the  sack.
if
storekeepers  stepped  out  and  gawked.  i
could  see  the  end  of  the  street,  but  it
looked as if it were a hundred miles away.
my  face  was  as  red  as  a  fox’s  tail.  i
ducked my head, tightened my grip on the
sack, and walked on.

in

i don’t know where they came from, but
like  chickens  coming  home  to  roost,  they
flocked  around  me.  most  of  them  were
about  my  age.  some  were  a  little  bigger,
some  smaller.  they  ganged  around  me,
screaming  and  yelling.  they  started
clapping  their  hands  and  chanting,  “the
dog  boy  has  come  to  town.  the  dog  boy
has come to town.”

my heart burst. tears came rolling. the
day  i  had  waited  for  so  long  had  turned
black and ugly.

the  leader  of  the  gang  was  about  my
size. he had a dirty freckled face and his
two front teeth were missing. i suppose he
had  lost  them  in  a  back  alley  fight.  his
shock of yellow sunburnt hair bobbed up
and down as he skipped and jumped to the
rhythm of the “dog boy” song. he wore a
pair  of  cowboy  boots.  they  were  two
sizes  too  big  for  him,  no  doubt  handed
down by an older brother.

he  stomped  on  my  right  foot.  i  looked
down  and  saw  a  drop  of  blood  ooze  out
from under the broken nail. it hurt like the
dickens but i gritted my teeth and walked
on.

freckle-face pulled the ear of my little
girl pup. i heard her painful cry. that was
too much. i hadn’t worked two long hard
years  for  my  pups  to  have  some  freckle-

face punk pull their ears.

swinging the sack from my shoulder, i
walked  over  and  set
in  a
doorway. as  i  turned  around  to  face  the
mob, i doubled up my fist, and took a jack
dempsey stance.

it  down

freckle-face  said,  “so  you  want  to

fight.” he came in swinging.
i  reached  way  back

in  arkansas
somewhere.  by  the  time  my  fist  had
traveled all the way down to the cherokee
strip, there was a lot of power behind it.

smack  on  the  end  of  freck’s  nose  it
exploded.  with  a  loud  grunt  he  sat  down
in  the  dusty  street.  grabbing  his  nose  in
both  hands,  he  started
rocking  and
moaning.  i  saw  the  blood  squeeze  out
between his fingers.

another  one  sailed  in.  he  didn’t  want

to fight. he wanted to wrestle. he stuck a
finger  in  my  mouth.  i  ground  down.
shaking his hand and yelling like the hoot
owls  were  after  him,  he  ran  across  the
street.

all at once the beating stopped. i heard

another  one  bored  in.  i  aimed  for  his
eye, but my aim was a little low. it caught
him  in  the  adam’s  apple.  a  sick  look
came  over  his
face.  bending  over,
croaking  like  a  bullfrog  that  had  been
caught  by  a  water  moccasin,  he  started
going around in a circle.

but  there  were  too  many  of  them.  by
sheer weight and numbers, they pulled me
down.  i  managed  to  twist  over  on  my
stomach and buried my face in my arms. i
could  feel  them  beating  and  kicking  my
body.

loud cries from the gang. turning over on
my back, i was just in time to see the big
marshal plant a number-twelve boot in the
seat of the last kid. i just knew i was next.
i  wondered  if  he’d  kick  me  while  i  was
down.

i  lay  where  i  was.  he  started  toward
me. i closed my eyes. i felt a hand as big
as  an  anvil  clamp  on  my  shoulder.  i
thought,  “he’s  going  to  stand  me  up,  and
then knock me down.”

he raised me to a sitting position. his
deep  friendly  voice  said,  “are  you  all
right, son?”

i opened my eyes. there was a smile on
his wide rugged face. in a choking voice, i
said, “yes, sir. i’m all right.”

he helped me to my feet. his big hands
started brushing the dust from my clothes.

“those  kids  are  pretty  tough,  son,”  he
said,  “but  they’re  really  not  bad.  they’ll
grow up some day.”

“marshal,”  i  said,  “i  wouldn’t  have
fought  them,  but  they  pulled  my  pup’s
ears.”

he  looked  over  to  my  sack.  one  pup
had worked its way almost out through the
hole. the other one’s head and two little
paws  were  sticking  out.  both  of  them
were whimpering.

a  smile  spread  all  over

the  big
marshal’s face. “so that’s what started the
fight,” he said.

walking  over,  he  knelt  down  and
started  petting  the  pups.  “they’re  fine-
looking  dogs,”  he  said.  “where  did  you
get them?”

i  told  him  i  had  ordered  them  from

“what did they cost you?” he asked.
“forty dollars,” i said.
he asked if my father had bought them

“no,” i said. “i bought them myself.”
he asked me where i got the money.
“i worked and saved it,” i said.
“it  takes  a  long  time  to  save  forty

for me.

dollars,” he said.

“yes,” i said. “it took me two years.”
“two years!” he exclaimed.
i  saw  an  outraged  look  come  over  the
marshal’s  face.  reaching  up,  he  pushed
his hat back. he glanced up and down the
street. i heard him mutter, “there’s not a
one in that bunch with that kind of grit.”

picking up my sack, i said, “thanks for
helping  me  out.  i  guess  i’d  better  be

he asked where i lived.
i said, “up the river a way.”
“well,  you’ve  got  time  for  a  bottle  of

pop before you go, haven’t you?”

i started to say “no,” but looking at his
big friendly smile, i smiled back and said,
“i guess i have.”

walking

into  a  general  store,

the
marshal went over to a large red box and
pulled back the lid. he asked what kind i
wanted.  i’d  never  had  a  bottle  of  pop  in
my life, and didn’t know what to say.

seeing  my  hesitation,  he  said,  “this

heading for home.”

strawberry looks pretty good.”

i said that would be fine.
the cool pop felt wonderful to my hot
dry  throat.  my  dark  little  world  had
brightened  up  again.  i  had  my  pups,  and

had found a wonderful friend. i knew that
the  stories  i  had  heard  about  marshals
weren’t  true.  never  again  would  i  be
scared when i saw one.

back  out  on  the  street,  i  shook  hands
with  the  marshal,  saying  as  i  did,  “if
you’re  ever  up  in  my  part  of  the  country
come over and see me. you can find our
place by asking at my grandfather’s store.”
“store?” he asked. “why, the only store

upriver is about thirty miles from here.”

“yes,”  i  said,  “that’s  my  grandpa’s

place.”

he asked if i was afoot.
“yes,” i said.
“you  won’t  make  it  tonight,”  he  said.

“no,”  i  said.  “i  intend  to  camp  out

“will you?”

somewhere.”

scared of the mountains.”

he looked at me and at my pups. taking
off  his  hat,  he  scratched  his  head.
chuckling  deep  down  in  his  barrel-like
chest,  he  said,  “yes,  i  guess  you  will  be
all right. well, good-bye and good luck! if
you’re ever in town again look me up.”

from far down the street, i looked back.
the  marshal  was  still  standing  where  i
had left him. he waved his hand. i waved
back.

on the outskirts of town, i stopped and

i saw he was bothered.
“i’ll  be  all  right,”  i  said.  “i’m  not

picked up a can and my provisions.

i hadn’t gone far before i realized that i
had  undertaken  a  tough  job.  the  sack
became heavier and heavier.

for  a  while  my  pups  cried  and

whimpered.  they  had  long  since  pulled
their heads back in the sack. i would peek
in  at  them  every  once  in  a  while.  they
were  doing  all  right.  curled  up  into  two
little round balls on my bundles, they were
fast asleep.

deep in the heart of the sparrow hawk
mountains, night overtook me. there, in a
cave with a stream close by, i put up for
the night.

taking  my  pups  and  bundles  from  the
gunny  sack,  i  used  it  to  gather  leaves  to
make us a bed. my pups followed me on
every
trip,  whimpering  and  crying,
tumbling and falling over sticks and rocks.
after the bed was made i built a fire. in
a can of water from the mountain stream, i
boiled  three  eggs.  next,  i  boiled  half  of
the  remaining  salt  pork.  cutting  the  meat

up  in  small  pieces,  i  fed  it  to  my  pups.
each  of  us  had  a  piece  of  candy  for
dessert. my pups enjoyed the candy. with
their needle-sharp teeth, they gnawed and
worried with it until it was melted away.
they  were  busy  playing,

i
dragged up several large timbers and built
a  fire  which  would  last  for  hours.  in  a
short  time  the  cave  grew  warm  and
comfortable  from  the  heat.  the  leaves
were soft, and felt good to my tired body
and  sore  feet. as  i  lay  stretched  out,  my
pups  crawled  all  over  me.  i  played  with
them. they would waddle up to the front
of  the  cave,  look  at  the  fire,  and  come
scampering  back  to  roll  and  play  in  the
soft leaves.

while

i noticed the boy dog was much larger
than the girl dog. he was a deeper red in

color. his chest was broad and solid. his
puppy  muscles  knotted  and  rippled  under
the velvety skin. he was different in every
way. he would go closer to the fire. i saw
right away he was bold and aggressive.

once  he  went  around  the  fire  and
ventured out into the darkness. i waited to
see  if  he  would  come  back.  he  came
wobbling  to  the  mouth  of  the  cave,  but
hesitated there. he made several attempts
to come back, but the flames were leaping
higher  by  the  minute.  the  space  between
the fire and the wall of the cave was much
hotter  than  when  he  had  ventured  out.
whimpering  and  crying,  he  kept  trying  to
get around the fire. i said not a word; just
watched.

puppy though he was, he did something
which brought a smile to my face. getting

as  close  as  he  could  to  the  side  of  the
cave,  he  turned  his  rear  to  the  fire.
hopping sideways, yipping at every jump,
he made it through the heat and sailed into
the  pile  of  leaves.  he  had  had  enough.
curling up in a ball close to me, he went
to sleep.

the girl pup was small and timid. her
legs  and  body  were  short.  her  head  was
small and delicate. she must have been a
runt  in  the  litter.  i  didn’t  have  to  look
twice  to  see  that  what  she  lacked  in
power, she made up in brains. she was a
much smarter dog than the boy dog, more
sure  of  herself,  more  cautious.  i  knew
when the trail became tough, she would be
the one to unravel it.

i knew i had a wonderful combination.
in my dogs, i had not only the power, but

the brains along with it.

my fire had burned down, leaving only

i  was  a  tired  boy.  my  legs  were  stiff,
and  my  feet  sore  and  throbbing.  my
shoulders  were  red  and  raw  from  the
weight of the sack. i covered my pups up
in the leaves and moved my body as close
to  them  as  i  could.  i  knew  as  night  wore
on, and the fire died down, the chill would
come. tired but happy, i fell asleep.

along in the silent hours of night, i was
awakened.  i  opened  my  eyes,  but  didn’t
move.  i  lay  and  listened,  trying  to  figure
out  what  it  was  that  had  aroused  me. at
first  i  thought  one  of  my  pups  had
awakened me by moving and whimpering.
i discarded this thought for i could see that
they  were  both  fast  asleep.  i  decided  it
was my imagination working.

a  glowing  red  body  of  coals.  the  cave
was  dark  and  silent.  chill  from  the  night
had crept in. i was on the point of getting
up to rebuild my fire, when i heard what
had awakened me. at first i thought it was
a  woman  screaming.  i  listened.  my  heart
began to pound. i could feel the strain all
over my body as nerves grew tighter and
tighter.

it came again, closer this time. the high
pitch of the scream shattered the silence of
the quiet night. the sound seemed to be all
around  us.  it  screamed  its  way  into  the
cave  and  rang  like  a  blacksmith’s  anvil
against the rock walls. the blood froze in
my  veins.  i  was  terrified. although  i  had
never  heard  one,  i  knew  what  it  was.  it
was the scream of a mountain lion.

the  big  cat  screamed  again.  leaves

boiled and stirred where my pups were. in
the reflection of the glowing coals, i could
see that one was sitting up. it was the boy
dog. a  leaf  had  become  entangled  in  the
fuzzy hair of a floppy ear. the ear flicked.
the leaf dropped.

my  father  had  told  me  lions  were
scared of fire. i started throwing on more

again the hellish scream rang out over
the mountains. leaves flew as my pup left
the bed. i jumped up and tried to call him
back.

reaching  the  mouth  of  the  cave,  he
stopped.  raising  his  small  red  head  high
in the air, he bawled his challenge to the
devil cat. the bawl must have scared him
as  much  as  it  had  startled  me.  he  came
tearing  back.  the  tiny  hairs  on  his  back
were standing on end.

wood.  i  was  glad  i’d  dragged  up  a  good
supply while making camp.

hearing a noise from the bed, i looked
the
back.  the  girl  pup,  hearing
commotion,  had  gotten  up  and  joined  the
boy  dog.  they  were  sitting  side  by  side
with  their  bodies  stiff  and  rigid.  their
beady  little  eyes  bored  into  the  darkness
beyond  the  cave.  the  moist  tips  of  their
little black noses wiggled and twisted as
if trying to catch a scent.

what  i  saw  in  my  pups  gave  me
courage.  my  knees  quit  shaking  and  my
heart stopped pounding.

i figured the lion had scented my pups.
the more i thought about anything harming
them, the madder i got. i was ready to die
for my dogs.

every  time  the  big  cat  screamed,  the

boy  dog  would  run  to  the  mouth  of  the
cave  and  bawl  back  at  him.  i  started
whooping  and  throwing  rocks  down  the
mountainside,  hoping  to  scare  the  lion
away. through the long hours of the night,
i kept this up.

the lion prowled around us, screaming
and  growling;  first  on  the  right,  and  then
on  the  left,  and  above  and  below.  in  the
wee hours of morning, he gave up and left
to  stalk  other  parts  of  the  mountains.  i’m
sure  he  thought  he  didn’t  stand  a  chance
against  two  vicious  hounds  and  a  big
hunter.

vi

after the terrifying night, the bright morning
sun was a welcome sight. i fixed breakfast
and soon we were on our way. i tried to
get the pups to follow me, so as to lighten
my load. they would for a way, and then,
sitting down on their rears, they would cry
and whimper. back in the sack they would
go,  with  their  heads  sticking  out  of  the
holes  and  their  long  ears  flopping.  i
moved on.

about midday i entered country i knew.
i  wasn’t  far  from  home.  i  dropped  down
out  of  the  mountains  into  the  bottoms  far
above the place i had crossed the river on
my way to town.

its

course

staying  on  the  left  of  the  river,  i
followed
several
campgrounds, but didn’t stop until i came
to the one where i had found the magazine.
here  i  took  the  pups  out  of  the  sack  and
sat down in the warm sand.

past

as  the  afternoon  wore  on,  i  sat  there
deep in thought. i was trying to think what
i was going to tell my mother and father. i
could think of nothing. finally i decided i
would just tell them the truth, and with the
help of the new overalls, cloth, and candy,
i would weather the storm.

my  pups  were  having  a  big  time
playing. with their little front paws locked
around  each  other,  they  were  growling,
rolling, and chewing on one another. they
looked so cute, i laughed out loud.

while i was watching their romping, the

thought came, “i haven’t named them.”

i went over the list of names. for him, i
tried “red,” “bugle,” “lead,” name after
name  as  before.  for  her,  i  tried  “susie,”
“mabel,”  “queen,”  all  kinds  of  girl
names. none seemed to fit.

still mumbling names over and over, i
glanced  up.  there,  carved  in  the  white
bark of a sycamore tree, was a large heart.
in the center of the heart were two names,
“dan”  and  “ann.”  the  name  dan  was  a
little  larger  than  ann.  it  was  wide  and
bold. the scar stood out more. the name
ann  was  small,  neat,  and  even.  i  stared
unbelieving—for  there  were  my  names.
they were perfect.

i walked over and picked up my pups.
looking  at  him,  i  said,  “your  name  is
dan.  i’ll  call  you  old  dan.”  looking  at

her, i said, “your name, little girl, is ann.
i’ll call you little ann.”

i stayed at the campground until dark. i

it  was  then  i  realized  it  was  all  too
perfect.  here  in  this  fishermen’s  camp,  i
had  found  the  magazine  and  the  ad.  i
looked  over  at  the  old  sycamore  log.
there i had asked god to help me get two
hound pups. there were the pups, rolling
and playing in the warm sand. i thought of
the old k. c. baking powder can, and the
fishermen. how freely they had given their
nickels and dimes.

i  looked  up  again  to  the  names  carved
in  the  tree.  yes,  it  was  all  there  like  a
large  puzzle.  piece  by  piece,  each  fit
perfectly until the puzzle was complete. it
could not have happened without the help
of an unseen power.

knew i had to go home but i put it off as
long  as  i  could.  the  crying  of  the  pups,
telling me they were hungry, made up my
mind for me. i knew the time had come for
me to face my mother and father.

i  sacked  up  my  dogs  and  waded  the
river.  as  i  came  out  of  the  bottoms,  i
could  see  the  lamplight  glow  from  the
windows  of  our  home.  one  of  the  small
yellow  squares  darkened  for  an  instant.
someone  had  walked  across  the  floor.  i
wondered who it was. i heard daisy, our
milk cow, moo. i was thinking so hard of
what  i  would  say,  it  startled  me  for  a
second.

reaching  the  gate  to  our  house,  i
stopped.  i  had  never  thought  our  home
very  pretty,  but
looked
different.  it  looked  clean  and  neat  and

that  night

it

peaceful,  nestled  there  in  the  foothills  of
the ozarks. yes, on that night i was proud
of our home.

my  bare  feet  made  no  noise  as  i
crossed  the  porch.  with  my  free  hand,  i
reached and pulled the leather that worked
the latch. slowly the door swung inward.
i couldn’t see my father or sisters. they
were  too  far  to  the  right  of  me,  but  my
mother  was  directly  in  front  of  the  door,
sitting  in  her  old  cane-bottom  rocker,
knitting.

she looked up. i saw all the worry and
grief  leave  her  eyes.  her  head  bowed
down.  the  knitting  in  her  hands  came  up
to  cover  her  face.  i  stepped  inside  the
room. i wanted to run to her and comfort
her and tell her how sorry i was for all the
worry and grief i had caused her.

the booming voice of my father shook

me from my trance.

he  said,  “well,  what  have  you  got

there?”

laughing, he got up from his chair and
came over to me. he reached and took the
sack from my shoulder.

“when we started looking for you,” he
said, “i went to the store and your grandpa
told me all about it. it wasn’t too hard to
figure  out  what  you  had  done,  but  you
should have told us.”

i ran to my mother and, dropping to my

knees, i buried my face in her lap.

as  mama  patted  my  head,  i  heard  her
say in a quavering voice, “oh, why didn’t
you tell us? why?”

i couldn’t answer.
between  sobs,  i  heard  the  squeals  of

delight from my sisters as they fondled my
pups.

i  heard  my  father  say,  “what’s  this

other stuff you’ve got?”

without  raising  my  head  from  my
mother’s  lap,  in  a  choking  voice  i  said,
“one is for you, one is for mama, and the
other is for the girls.”

i  heard  the  snapping  of  string  and  the
rattle of paper. the oh’s and ah’s from my
sisters were wonderful to hear.

papa  came  over  to  mama.  laying  the
cloth  on  the  arm  of  her  chair,  he  said,
“well, you’ve been wanting a new dress.
here is enough cloth to make half a dozen
dresses.”

realizing that everything was forgiven,
i  stood  up  and  dried  my  eyes.  papa  was
pleased with his new overalls. my sisters

forgot  the  pups  for  the  candy.  the  light
that  was  shining  from  my  mother’s  eyes,
as she fingered the cheap cotton cloth, was
something i will never forget.

mama warmed some milk for the pups.
they drank until their little tummies were
tight and round.

as i ate, papa sat down at the table and
started  talking  man-talk  to  me.  he  asked,
“how are things in town?”

i  told  him  it  was  boiling  with  people.
the  wagon  yard  was  full  of  wagons  and
teams.

he asked if i had seen anyone i knew.
i told him i hadn’t, but the stationmaster

had asked about him.

night.

he  asked  me  where  i  had  spent  the

i told him about the cave in the sparrow

hawk mountains.

he  said  that  must  have  been  the  one

called “robber’s cave.”

my youngest sister piped up, “did you

stay all night with some robbers?”

my oldest sister said, “silly, that was a
long  time  ago.  there  aren’t  any  robbers
there now.”

the other one put her nickel’s worth in,

“weren’t you scared?”

“no,”  i  said,  “i  wasn’t  scared  of
staying in the cave, but i heard a mountain
lion  scream  and  it  scared  me  half  to
death.”

“aw,  they  won’t  bother  you,”  papa

said. “you had a fire, didn’t you?”

i said, “yes.”
he  said,  “they’ll  never  bother  you
unless they are wounded or cornered, but

if they are, you had better look out.”
papa asked me how i liked town.
i  said  i  didn’t  like  it  at  all,  and
wouldn’t live there even if they gave it to
me.

with  a  querying  look  on  his  face,  he
said,  “i’m  afraid  i  don’t  understand.  i
thought you always wanted to go to town.”
“i did,” i said, “but i don’t any more. i
don’t  like  the  people  there  and  couldn’t
understand them.”

“what  was  wrong  with  them?”  he

asked.

i  told  him  how  they  had  stared  at  me,
and had even laughed and made fun of me.
he  said,  “aw,  i  don’t  think  they  were

making fun of you, were they?”

“yes, they were,” i said, “and to beat it
all,  the  boys  jumped  on  me  and  knocked

me down in the dirt. if it hadn’t been for
the  marshal,  i  would  have
taken  a
beating.”

papa  said,  “so  you  met  the  marshal.

what did you think of him?”

i  told  him  he  was  a  nice  man.  he  had

bought me a bottle of soda pop.

at  the  mention  of  soda  pop,  the  blue
eyes  of  my  sisters  opened  wide.  they
started  firing  questions  at  me,  wanting  to
know what color it was, and what it tasted
like. i told them it was strawberry and it
bubbled and tickled when i drank it, and it
made me burp.

the  eager  questions  of  my  three  little
sisters had had an effect on my father and
mother.

papa  said,  “billy,  i  don’t  want  you  to
feel  badly  about  the  people  in  town.  i

don’t  think  they  were  poking  fun  at  you,
anyway not like you think they were.”

“maybe  they  weren’t,”  i  said,  “but  i
still don’t want to ever live in town. it’s
too crowded and you couldn’t get a breath
of fresh air.”

in a sober voice my father said, “some
day  you  may  have  to  live  in  town. your
mother and i don’t intend to live in these
hills all our lives. it’s no place to raise a
family. a  man’s  children  should  have  an
education. they should get out and see the
world and meet people.”

“i  don’t  see  why  we  have  to  move  to
town to get an education,” i said. “hasn’t
mama taught us how to read and write?”

“there’s more to an education than just
reading  and  writing,”  papa  said.  “much
more.”

moving to town.

“well, it’ll be some time yet,” he said.
“we  don’t  have  the  money  now,  but  i’m
hoping some day we will.”

i  asked  him  when  he  thought  we’d  be

from  the  stove  where  she  was  heating
salt water for my feet, mama said in a low
voice,  “i’ll  pray  every  day  and  night  for
that day to come. i don’t want you children
to grow up without an education, not even
knowing what a bottle of soda pop is, or
ever seeing the inside of a schoolhouse. i
don’t think i could stand that. i’ll just keep
praying and some day the good lord may
answer my prayer.”

i  told  my  mother  i  had  seen  the
schoolhouse  in  town.  again  i  had  to
answer  a
thousand  questions  for  my
sisters.  i  told  them  it  was  made  of  red

brick  and  was  bigger  than  grandpa’s
store, a lot bigger. there must have been
at  least  a  thousand  kids  going  to  school
there.

i  told  all  about  the  teeter-totters,  the
swings made out of log chains, the funny-
looking  pipe  that  ran  up  the  side  of  the
building,  and  how  i  had  climbed  up  in  it
and  slid  out  like  the  other  kids.  i  didn’t
tell them how i came out.

“i  think  that  was  a  fire  escape,”  papa

“fire escape!” i said. “it looked like a

slide to me.”

“did  you  notice  where  it  made  that

bend up at the top?” he asked.

i nodded my head.
“well,  inside  the  school  there’s  a
door,” he said. “if the school gets on fire,

a fire,” i said.

“well,  it’s  getting  late,”  papa  said.
“we’ll  talk  about  this  some  other  time.
we’d better get to bed as we have a lot of
work to do tomorrow.”

they open the door. the children jump in
the pipe and slide out to safety.”

“boy, that’s a keen way of getting out of

my  pups  were  put  in  the  corncrib  for
the night. i covered them with shucks and
kissed them good night.

the  next  day  was  a  busy  one  for  me.
with  the  hampering  help  of  my  sisters  i
made the little doghouse.

papa  cut  the  ends  off  his  check  lines
and  gave  them  to  me  for  collars.  with
painstaking care, deep in the tough leather
i  scratched  the  name  “old  dan”  on  one
and “little ann” on the other. with a nail

and  a  rock  two  holes  were  punched  in
each end of the straps. i put them around
their  small  necks  and  laced  the  ends
together with bailing wire.

that  evening  i  had  a  talk  with  my
mother.  i  told  her  about  praying  for  the
two  pups,  about  the  magazine  and  the
plans  i  had  made.  i  told  her  how  hard  i
had tried to find names for them and how
strange  it  was  finding  them  carved  in  the
bark of a sycamore tree.

and i’ll always be thankful.”

with  a  smile  on  her  face,  she  asked,
“do  you  believe  god  heard  your  prayer
and helped you?”

“yes,  mama,”  i  said.  “i  know  he  did

it  seems  that  the  worries  and  wants  of  a
young boy never cease. now that i had my
pups  another  obstacle  had  cropped  up.
this  one  looked  absolutely  impossible.  i
had  to  have  a  coonskin  so  i  could  train
them.

with  my

traps  and  a
bulldogged determination, i set out to trap
mister  ringtail.  for  three  solid  weeks  i
practically lived on the river. i tried every
trick i knew. it was no use. i just couldn’t
catch the wiley old coons.

in desperation i went to my grandfather.
he  smiled  as  he  listened  to  my  tale  of
woe.  “well,  we’ll  have  to  do  something

about that,” he said. “to train those dogs
right, you’ll need that coon hide, that’s for
sure. now you watch the store while i go
over to my tool shed. i’ll be right back.”

after  what  seemed  like  an  eternity  i
saw him coming. he was carrying a brace
and bit, that was all.

with  a  mischievous  little  smile  on  his
face,  he  said,  “you  wouldn’t  think  a
fellow could catch a coon with this brace
and bit, would you?”

i thought he was kidding me and it made
me feel bad. “why, grandpa,” i said, “you
couldn’t  catch  a  coon  in  a  jillion  years
with  that  thing.  you  just  don’t  have  any
idea how smart they are.”

“yes, you can,” he said. “you bet your
boots  you  can.  why,  when  i  was  a  boy  i
caught coons on top of coons with one of

these things.”

i  saw  grandpa  was  serious  and  i  got

he laid the brace down on the counter,
picked up a small paper sack, and filled it
about half-full of horseshoe nails.

“now  you  do  everything  exactly  as  i
tell  you,”  he  said,  “and  you’ll  catch  that
coon.”

“yes, sir, grandpa,” i said, “i will. i’ll

do anything to catch one of them.”

“now the first thing you’ll need is some
bright objects,” he said. “the best thing is
bright shiny tin. cut out some little round
pieces,  a  little  smaller  than  this  bit.  do
you understand?”

i nodded my head.
“now,”  he  said,  “you  go  down  along
the  river  where  there  are  a  lot  of  coon

tracks. find a good solid log close by and
bore a hole down about six inches. drop
one of the bright pieces of tin down in the
hole,  and  be  sure  it’s  laying  right  on  the
bottom.”

i was all ears. i didn’t want to miss one
word my grandfather said. now and then i
would  glance  at  him  to  see  if  he  was
kidding me.

in  a  serious  voice,  he  went  on  talking.
“now  pay  close  attention,”  he  said,
“because this is the main part of the trap.”
with  eyes  as  big  as  a  hoot  owl’s,  i

looked and listened.

“now,  we’ll  say  this  is  the  hole  you
bored in the log,” he said. “about an inch
apart,  drive  these  nails  in  on  a  slant
opposite each other.”

holding  one  of  the  nails  in  his  right

hand, he showed me the right angle.

“the  ends  of  the  nails  will  enter  the
hole  about  halfway  between  the  top  and
the piece of tin,” he continued. “leave an
opening  between  the  sharp  points  big
enough for a coon to get his paw through.”

he asked me if i understood.
again  i  nodded  my  head  and  moved  a

it won’t fail. you see a coon is a curious
little  animal.  anything  that  is  bright  and

little closer to him.

grandpa?” i asked.

“how  is  that  going  to  catch  a  coon,

shiny  attracts  him.  he  will  reach  in  and
pick  it  up.  when  his  paw  closes  on  the
bright  object  it  balls  up,  and  when  he
starts  to  pull  it  from  the  hole,  the  sharp
ends of the nails will gouge into his paw
and he’s caught.”

he looked over at me.
“well,  what  do  you  think  of  it?”  he

asked.

i closed my eyes and in my mind i could
see  the  funnel-like  entrance  of  the  hole,
and the sharp slanting points of the nails. i
could  see  the  coon  reaching  in  for  the
shiny  piece  of  metal.  naturally  his  paw
would be much larger when closed than it
was  when  he  reached  in.  it  would  be
impossible for it to pass the sharp nails.

it was all looking pretty good to me and
i was on the point of saying so, when it hit

me. why, all the coon had to do was open
his paw, drop the object, and he was free.
it all blew up then and there. i just knew
my grandfather was playing a joke on me.
i  stepped  back  and  almost  cried  as  i
said,  “grandpa,  you’re  kidding  me.  that
kind of a trap couldn’t catch a coon. why
all he’d have to do is open his paw, drop
the piece of tin, and he could pull it from
the hole.”

grandpa  started  roaring  with  laughter.
this did make me feel bad. with tears in
my eyes, i started for the door.

“wait  a  minute,”  grandpa  said.  “i’m
not kidding you. oh, i know i like to have
my  jokes,  same  as  any  man,  but  i  meant
every word i said.”

i  turned  around  and  looked  at  him.  he
had stopped laughing and there was a hurt

expression on his face.

“i  wasn’t  laughing  at  you,”  he  said.  “i
was  laughing  more  at  myself  than  you.  i
just  wanted  to  see  if  you  were  smart
enough  to  see  that  there  was  a  way  the
coon could free himself.”

“a  fellow  wouldn’t  have  to  be  very

smart to see that,” i said.

grandpa started talking seriously again.
“you  know,”  he  said,”  a  coon  has  more
than  one  peculiarity  about  him.  when  i
was a boy i had a pet coon. by watching
him, i saw and learned a lot of things.

“he had a den in an old hollow tree in
our front yard. i don’t know the number of
times  i’d  have  to  climb  that  tree  and  get
my  mother’s  scissors,  buttons,  needles,
and thimble from his den. why, he’d even
carry  out  our  knives,  forks,  and  spoons.

anything  that  was  bright  and  shiny,  he
took to his den.”

grandpa  stopped  talking  for  a  few
minutes. i could see a faraway look in his
eyes.  once  again  he  was  living  in  those
long-ago days. i waited in silence for him
to go on with his story.

“one of the most peculiar things about
that  coon,”  he  said,  “was  his  front  feet.
once he wrapped those little paws around
something he would never let go.

“my  mother  had  an  old  churn.  it  was
one of those kind with a small hole in the
lid  for  the  dasher.  when  she  would  get
through  churning,  she  would  take  the
dasher  out  to  wash  it.  that  crazy  coon
would climb up on top of the churn, poke
his  little  front  paw  through  the  hole,  and
get a fistful of butter. the hole was small,

and when he closed his paw, he couldn’t
get it back out. all he had to do was open
it, drop the butter, and he would be free,
but  do  you  think  he  would?  no,  sir.  he
would  carry  that  churn  lid  all  over  the
house,  squalling  and  growling.  why,  it
took everyone in the house to free him. i’d
have to wrap him up in a gunny sack or an
old coat and pry his claws loose from the
butter. seeing this time after time is what
gave  me  the  idea  for  this  trap.  once  he
reaches  in  and  gets  hold  of  that  tin,  he’s
caught,  because  he  will  never  open  his
paw.”

with  my  confidence  restored,  it  all
sounded  pretty  good  to  me  and  i  was
anxious  to  try  out  this  wonderful  plan.  i
thanked  him  and,  taking  the  brace  and
nails, i left the store.

by the time i reached home it was too
late  in  the  day  to  start  making  my  traps.
that  night  i  talked  the  idea  over  with
papa.

“i’ve  heard  of  coons  being  caught  that
way,”  he  said,  “but  i  never  paid  much
attention  to  it.  your  grandfather  should
know,  though,  for  he  was  quite  a  coon
hunter when he was a boy.”

“from  what  he  told  me,”  i  said,  “it

never fails.”

make my traps.

papa  asked  if  i  wanted  him  to  help

“no,”  i  said,  “i  think  i  can  do  it

myself.”

i  didn’t  sleep  too  well  that  night.  i
bored holes, drove nails, and fought coons
practically all night.

early  the  next  morning  i  went  to  the

trash pile. as i stirred around in the rusty
old  cans,  i  thought  of  another  time  i  had
searched for a can. finally i found the one
i wanted. it was bright and shiny.

everything  was  going  along  just  fine
until  mama  caught  me  cutting  out  the
circles  of  tin  with  her  scissors.  i  always
swore she could find the biggest switches
of any woman in the ozarks. that time she
overdid it. i was almost to the river before
the stinging stopped.

it  wasn’t  hard  to  find  places  for  my
traps. all  along  the  river  large  sycamore
logs lay partly submerged in the clear blue
water.  on  one  where  i  could  see  the
muddy little tracks of the ringtails, i bored
a  hole,  dropped  in  a  piece  of  tin,  and
drove my nails.

on  down  the  river  i  went,  making  my

traps.  i  stopped  when  i  ran  out  of  nails.
altogether i had fourteen traps.

that  night  papa  asked  me  how  i  was

“oh, all right,” i said. “i’ve got fourteen

making out.

of them made.”

he  laughed  and  said,  “well,  you  can’t

ever tell. you may catch one.”

the  next  morning  i  was  up  with  the
chickens. i took my pups with me as i just
knew i’d have a big ringtail trapped and i
wanted

disappointed boy when i peeked out of a
canebrake at my last trap and didn’t see a
coon. all  the  way  home  i  tried  to  figure
out what i had done wrong.

i went to papa. he put his thinking cap
on and thought the situation over. “maybe

made  those  traps,”  he  said.  “if  you  did,
it’ll take a while for it to go away. now i
wouldn’t get too impatient. i’m pretty sure
you’ll catch one sooner or later.”

one  morning  i  didn’t  get  up  to  run  my

papa’s words perked me up just like air
does a deflated inner tube. he was right. i
had simply left too much scent around my
traps.  all  i  had  to  do  was  wait  until  it
disappeared and i’d have my coon hide.

morning after morning it was the same
old  disappointment;  no  coon.  when  a
week had gone by and still no results from
my traps, i gave up. what little patience i
had  was  completely  gone.  i  was  firmly
convinced  that  coons  didn’t  walk  on
sycamore logs any more, and bright shiny
objects had about as much effect on them
as a coon hound would.

trap  line.  i  stayed  in  bed.  what  was  the
use? it was just a waste of time.

when the family sat down to breakfast,
i heard my oldest sister say, “mama, isn’t
billy going to get up for breakfast?”

“why, is he in his room?” mama asked.
“i  didn’t  know.  i  thought  he  was  down
looking at his traps.”

i  heard  papa  say,  “i’ll  go  wake  him

up.”

he came to the door and said, “you’d

better get up, billy. breakfast is ready.”

“i  don’t  want  any  breakfast,”  i  said.

“i’m not hungry.”

papa took one look at me and saw i had
a bad case of the ringtail blues. he came
over and sat down on the bed.

“what’s  the  matter?”  he  asked.  “you

having coon trouble?”

“grandpa  lied  to  me,  papa,”  i  said.  “i
should’ve  known  better.  who  ever  heard
of  anyone  catching  a  coon  with  a  brace
and bit and a few horseshoe nails.”

“i  wouldn’t  say  that,”  papa  said.  “i
don’t think your grandpa deliberately lied
to you. besides, i’ve heard of coons being
caught that way.”

“well, i don’t think i’ve done anything
wrong,”  i  said.  “i’ve  done  everything
exactly  as  he  said,  and  i  haven’t  caught
one yet.”

“i still think it’s that scent,” papa said.
“you know, someone told me, or i read it
somewhere, that it takes about a week for
scent  to  die  away.  how  long  has  it  been
since you made those traps?”

“it’s been over a week,” i said.
“well, the way i figure, it’s about time

for you to catch one. yes, sir, i wouldn’t
be surprised if you came in with one any
day now.”

after  papa  had  left  the  room  i  lay
thinking  of  what  he  had  said.  “any  day
now.” i got up and hurried into my clothes.
as  soon  as  i  was  finished  with
breakfast, i called my pups and lit out for
the river.

the  first  trap  was  empty.  so  was  the
second  one.  that  old  feeling  of  doubt
came  over  me  again.  i  thought,  “it’s  no
use. i’ll never catch one and i so need the
skin to train my pups.”

on  the  way  to  my  third  trap  i  had  to
walk through a thick stand of wild cane. it
was  tough  going  and  my  pups  started
whimpering.  i  stopped  and  picked  them
up.

“we’ll be out of this in a few minutes,”

i said, “and then you’ll be all right.”

i came plowing out of the matted mass
and was right on the trap before i realized
it.  i  was  met  by  a  loud  squall.  i  was  so
surprised  i  dropped  the  pups.  there  he
was, my first coon.

he  was  humped  up  on  the  sycamore
log,  growling  and  showing  his  teeth.  he
kept  jerking  his  front  paw,  which  was
jammed deep in the hole i had bored. he
was trapped by his own curiosity.

i couldn’t move and i felt like my wind
had been cut off. i kept hearing a noise but
couldn’t  make  out  what  it  was.  the
movement  of  the  boy  pup  shook  me  from
my trance. the unidentified sound was his
bawling. he was trying to climb up on the
log and get to the coon.

i yelled at him and darted in to get hold
of his collar. on seeing my movement, the
coon  let  out  another  squall.  it  scared  me
half  to  death.  i  froze  in  my  tracks  and
started yelling again at my pup.

the girl pup saved him. like a cat in a

the girl pup worked around behind the
coon  and  climbed  up  on  the  log.  i
screamed at her. she paid no attention to
me.

digging  his  sharp  little  claws  in  the
bark,  the  boy  pup  made  it  to  the  top.  he
didn’t  hesitate.  straight  down
that
sycamore  log  he  charged.  with  teeth
bared, the coon waited. when my pup was
about two feet from him, he made a lunge.
the  coon  just  seemed  to  pull  my  pup  up
under his stomach and went to work with
tooth and claw.

corn crib, she sneaked in from behind and
sank  her  needlesharp  teeth  in  the  coon’s
back.

it  was  too  much  for  old  ringy.  he
turned  the  boy  pup  loose,  turned  around,
and  slapped  her  clear  off  the  log.  she
came running to me, yelping her head off. i
grabbed her up in my arms and looked for
the  boy  pup.  when  the  coon  had  turned
him loose, he too had fallen off the log. he
was trying to get back to the coon. i darted
in and grabbed him by the hind leg.

with a pup under each arm and running
as  fast  as  i  could,  i  lit  out  for  the  house.
coming  out  of  the  bottoms  into  a  fresh-
plowed  field  i  set  my  pups  down  so  i
could  get  a  little  more  speed.  i  started
yelling  as  soon  as  i  came  in  sight  of  the
house.

mama  came  flying  out  with  my  sisters
right behind her. papa was out by the barn
harnessing  his
team.  mama  yelled
something  to  him  about  a  snake.  he
dropped the harness, jumped over the rail
fence, and in a long lope started for me.

mama  reached  me  first.  she  grabbed
me and shouted, “where did it bite you?”
“bite me?” i said. “why mama, i’m not

bit. i’ve got him, mama. i’ve got him.”

“got what?” mama asked.
“a big coon,” i said. “the biggest one
the  river  bottoms.  he’s
this  big,
in
mama.” i made a circle with my arms as
big as a twenty-gallon keg.

mama just groaned way down deep and
covered her face with her hands. some big
tears  squeezed  out  between  her  fingers.
almost  in  a  whisper,  i  heard  her  say,

“thank  god;  i  thought  you  were  snake-
bitten.”

my  sisters,  seeing  mama  crying,

puckered up and started bawling.

“he needs a whipping,” the oldest one
said, “that’s what he needs, scaring mama
that way.”

something busted loose inside me and i

cried a little, too.

“i  didn’t  mean  to  scare  mama,”  i
sniffed. “i just wanted everyone to know i
caught a coon.”

up  until  this  time  papa  hadn’t  said  a

word. he just stood looking on.

“here  now,”  he  said,  “let’s  have  none
of  this  crying.  he  didn’t  mean  to  scare
anyone.”

taking  his  handkerchief

from  his
pocket, he stepped over to mama, put his

mama  poked  her  head  around  him  and
glared  at  me.  “billy  colman,”  she
shouted,  “if  you  ever  scare  me  like  that
again, i’ll take a switch and wear you to a
frazzle.”

this  hurt  my  feelings  and  i  really  did
get  tuned  up.  “everyone’s  mad  at  me,”  i
said,  “and  i  haven’t  done  anything  but
catch the biggest coon on the river.”

arm  around  her,  and  started  drying  her
eyes.

mama came over. “i’m sorry,” she said.
“i  didn’t  mean  to  be  cross,  but  you  did
scare me. i thought a rattlesnake had bitten
you.”

“now that that’s all settled,” papa said,
“we had better go get that coon.” looking
at mama, he said, “why don’t you and the
girls  go  with  us.  i  don’t  think  it’ll  take

long.”

mama looked at me, smiled, and turned
to the girls. “would you like to go?” she
asked.

their  only  answer  was  a

squealing and jumping up and down.

lot  of

on the way, mama noticed some blood
on  my  shirt.  she  stopped  me  and  started
looking me over.

“where  did  that  come  from?”  she

asked. “did that coon bite you?”

“no, mama,” i said. “i didn’t get close

enough for him to bite me.”

with  a  worried  look  on  her  face,  she
jerked out my shirt. “you don’t seem to be
scratched anywhere,” she said.

“maybe  this  is  where  it  came  from,”

papa said.

he reached down and picked up my boy

pup. his little black nose was split wide
open and was bleeding.

i  saw  a  relieved  look  come  over

mama’s face.

looking  at  me,  she  started  shaking  her
head.  “i  don’t  know,”  she  said.  “i  just
don’t know.”

“did  that  coon  get  hold  of  this  pup?”

papa asked.

“he  sure  did,  papa,”  i  said,  “but  it
wasn’t  the  coon’s  fault.  if  it  hadn’t  been
for little ann, he’d have eaten him up.”

i  told  how  my  dogs  had  tied  into  the

coon.

papa  laughed  as  he  fondled  my  pup.
“this dog is going to be a coon hound,” he
said, “and i mean a good one.”

the  coon  started  squalling  as  soon  as

we came in sight.

“my  goodness,”  mama  said,  “you
wouldn’t think anything so small would be
so vicious.”

papa  picked  up  a  club.  “now
everybody stand back out of the way,” he
said. “this won’t take long.”

my  pups  were  wanting  to  get  to  the
coon so badly that they were hard to hold.
i had to squeeze them up tight to keep them
from jumping right out of my arms.

my  sisters,  with  eyes  as  big  as  blue
marbles,  got  behind  mama  and  peeked
around her.

papa  whacked  the  coon  a  good  one
across the head. he let out a loud squall,
growled,  and  showed  his  teeth.  he  tried
hard to get to papa but the trap held him.

the girls buried their faces in mama’s
dress  and  started  bawling.  mama  turned

her  back  on  the  fight.  i  heard  her  say,  “i
wish we hadn’t come. poor thing.”

papa whacked him again and it was all

over.

it was too much for mama and the girls.
they left. i heard the tall cane rattling as
they ran for the house.

after  the  coon  was  killed,  i  walked
over.  papa  was  trying  to  get  the  coon’s
paw  from  the  trap.  he  couldn’t  do  it.
taking a pair of pliers from his pocket, he
said, “it’s a good thing i had these along
or we would have had to cut his foot off.”
after  papa  had  pulled  the  nails,  he
lifted  the  coon’s  paw  from  the  hole.
there, clamped firmly in it, was the bright
piece of tin.

in a low voice papa said, “well, i’ll be
darned. all  he  had  to  do  was  open  it  up

and  he  was  free,  but  he  wouldn’t  do  it.
your grandfather was right.”

a  sorrowful  look  came  over  papa’s
face as he ran his fingers through the soft,
yellow hair. “billy,” he said, “i want you
to  take  a  hammer  and  pull  the  nails  from
every one of those traps. it’s summertime
now and their fur isn’t any good. besides,
i  don’t  think  this  is  very  sportsmanlike.
the  coon  doesn’t  have  a  chance.  it’s  all
right  this  time. you  needed  this  one,  but
from now on i want you to catch them with
your dogs. that way they have a fifty-fifty
chance.”

“i  will,  papa,”  i  said.  “that’s  what  i

intended to do.”

while we were skinning the coon, papa
asked  me  when  i  was  going  to  start
training my dogs.

“no,  i  don’t  think  so,”  he  said.  “i’ve
heard that the younger they are the better it
is.”

“well,  in  that  case,”  i  said,  “i’ll  start

tomorrow.”

“i  don’t  know,”  i  said.  “do  you  think

they’re too young?”

with  the  help  of  my  oldest  sister,  we
started giving my pups their first lessons.
she would hold their collars while i made
trails with the hide for them to follow.

i’d climb trees that leaned out over the
river, jump out into the water, swim to the
other  side,  and  make  trails  up  and  down
the  bank.  with  a  long  pole  and  wire,  i’d
drag the hide on top of rail fences, swing
it  through  the  air,  and  let  it  touch  the
ground  twenty  or  thirty  feet  away.  i  did
everything with that hide a coon would do

and  probably  a  lot  of  things  a  coon
couldn’t do.

it was a beautiful sight to see my pups
work  those  trails.  at  first  they  were
awkward and didn’t know what to do, but
they would never quit trying.

old  dan  would  get  so  eager  and
excited, he would overrun a trail. where it
twisted  or  turned,  he  would  run  straight
on, bawling up a storm. it didn’t take him
long to realize that a smart old coon didn’t
always run in a straight line.

little  ann  never  overran  a  trail.  she
would  wiggle  and  twist,  cry  and  whine,
and pretty soon she would figure it out.

at  first  they  were  afraid  of  water.  i
never  would  admit  it  even  to  myself.  i
always said that they just didn’t like to get
wet.  they  would  follow  the  trail  to  the

stream  and  stop.  sitting  down  on  their
rears,  they  would  cry  and  beg  for  help.
with a pup under each arm, i’d wade out
into  the  stream  and  set  them  down  in  the
cool water. nine times out of ten, one pup
would  swim  one  way  and  the  other  one
would  go  just  the  opposite  way.  i  had  a
time with this part of their training, but my
persistence had no bounds.

it  wasn’t  long  until  they  loved  the
water. old dan would jump as far out as
he  could  and  practically  knock  the  river
dry. little ann would ease herself in and
swim  like  a  muskrat  for  the  opposite
shore.

i taught my dogs every trick i knew and
any new ones i heard about. i taught them
how  to  split  up  on  a  riverbank  to  search
for  the  hidden  trail,  because  it  was

impossible  to  tell  where  a  coon  would
come  out  of  the  water.  sometimes  he
might  swim  downstream  and  other  times
he might swim upstream. maybe he would
come back to the bank he had just left, or
he  would  cross  over  to  the  other  side.
perhaps he would stop in the middle of the
stream on an old drift.

sometimes  he  would  come  out  of  the
water by catching the dangling limbs of a
leaning  birch  and  climbing  up,  never
touching  the  bank.  or  he  could  come  out
on  the  same  trail  he  used  to  go  in,  and
back-track. he would sometimes crawl up
under  an  undermined  bank  or  into  an  old
muskrat den.

one of the favorite tricks of a smart old
ringtail  is  the  treebarking  trick.  this  he
accomplished  by  running  far  up  on  the

side of a tree and using his stout legs for
leverage,  springing  twenty  or  thirty  feet
away  before  touching  the  ground.  dumb
hounds  trail  up  to  the  tree  and  start
bawling  treed.  i  taught  my  dogs  to  circle
for  a  good  hundred  yards  to  be  sure  he
was still in the tree before bawling.

in  order  to  learn  more  about  coon
hunting, i’d hang around my grandfather’s
store  and  listen  to  the  stories  told  by  the
coon  hunters.  some  of  the  tales  i  heard
were long and tall, but i believed them all.
i could always tell when grandpa was
kidding me by the twinkle in his eyes. he
told me how a coon could climb right up
the fog and disappear in the stars, and how
he  could  leap  on  a  horse’s  back  and  run
him  over  your  dogs.  i  didn’t  care,  for  i
loved  to  hear  the  tall  tales. anything  that

had  a  coon  hair
completely.

in

it

i  believed

all  through  that  summer  and  into  the
late  fall  the  training  went  on. although  i
was  worn  down  to  a  frazzle,  i  was  a
happy  boy.  i  figured  i  was  ready  for  the
ringtails.

late one evening, tired and exhausted, i
sat down by a big sycamore and called my
dogs  to  me.  “it’s  all  over,”  i  said.
“there’ll  be  no  more
lessons.  i’ve
worked hard and i’ve done my best. from
now on it’s all up to you. hunting season
is just a few days away and i’m going to
let  you  rest  for  i  want  you  to  be  in  good
shape the night it opens.”

it  was  wonderful  indeed  how  i  could
have heart-to-heart talks with my dogs and
they  always  seemed  to  understand.  each

question  i  asked  was  answered  in  their
own doggish way.

although they couldn’t talk in my terms,
they had a language of their own that was
easy  to  understand.  sometimes  i  would
see the answer in their eyes, and again it
would be in the friendly wagging of their
tails. other times i could hear the answer
in a low whine or feel it in the soft caress
of  a  warm  flicking  tongue.  in  some  way,
they would always answer.

viii

the  day  hunting  season  opened,  i  was  as
nervous  as  samie,  our  house  cat.  part  of
that  seemingly  endless  day  was  spent
getting things ready for the coming night.

i cleaned my lantern and filled it full of
oil. with hog lard i greased my boots until
they were as soft as a hummingbird’s nest.
i  was  grinding  my  ax  when  papa  came
around.

he  smiled  as  he  said,  “this  is  the  big

night, isn’t it?”

“it  sure  is,  papa,”  i  said,  “and  i’ve

waited a long time for it.”

“yes,  i  know,”  he  said.  “i’ve  been
thinking—there’s  not  too  much  to  do

around here during the hunting season. i’m
pretty sure i can take care of things, so you
just go ahead and hunt all you want to.”

“thanks, papa,” i said. “i guess i’ll be
out  pretty  late  at  night,  and  i’ll  probably
have  to  do  a  lot  of  sleeping  in  the
daytime.”

like

papa started frowning. “you know,” he
said,  “your  mother  doesn’t
this
hunting of yours very much. she’s worried
about you being out all by yourself.”

“i can’t see why mama has to worry,” i
said. “haven’t i been roaming the woods
ever since i was big enough to walk, and
i’m almost fourteen now.”

“i know,” said papa. “it’s all right with
me,  but  women  are  a  little  different  than
men. they worry more.

“now just to be on the safe side, i think

it would be a good idea for you to tell us
where you’ll be hunting. then if anything
happens, we’ll know where to look.”

i  told  him  i  would,  but  i  didn’t  think

anything was going to happen.

after  papa  had  left,  i  started  thinking.
“he doesn’t even talk to me like i was a
boy any more. he talks to me like i was a
man.” these wonderful thoughts made me
feel just about as big as our old red mule.
i  had  a  good  talk  with  my  dogs.  “i’ve
waited almost three years for this night,” i
said, “and it hasn’t been easy. i’ve taught
you  everything  i  know  and  i  want  you  to
do your best.”

little  ann  acted  like  she  understood.
she whined and saved me a wash job on
my face. old dan may have, but he didn’t
act  like  it.  he  just  lay  there  in  the

was going to hunt.

on the river.”

“i’m not going far,” i said, “just down

sunshine, all stretched out and limber as a
rag.

during supper mama asked me where i

i  could  tell  mama  was  worried  and  it

didn’t make me feel too good.

“billy,”  she  said,  “i  don’t  approve  of
this  hunting,  but  it  looks  like  i  can’t  say
no;  not  after  all  you’ve  been  through,
getting your dogs, and all that training.”

“aw,  he’ll  be  all  right,”  papa  said.
“besides,  he’s  getting  to  be  a  good-size
man now.”

“man!”  mama  exclaimed.  “why,  he’s

still just a little boy.”

“you  can’t  keep  him  a  little  boy
always,” papa said. “he’s got to grow up

“i know,” mama said, “but i don’t like

it, not at all, and i can’t help worrying.”

“mama, please don’t worry about me,”
i said. “i’ll be all right. why, i’ve been all
over these hills, you know that.”

“i know,” she said, “but that was in the
daytime. i never worried too much when it
was daylight, but at night, that’s different.
it’ll be dark and anything could happen.”

“there  won’t  be  anything  happen,”  i

some day.”

said. “i promise i’ll be careful.”

mama  got  up  from  the  table  saying,
“well, it’s like i said, i can’t say no and i
can’t help worrying. i’ll pray every night
you’re out.”

the way mama had me feeling, i didn’t
know  whether  to  go  hunting  or  not.  papa
must  have  sensed  how  i  felt.  “it’s  dark

now,”  he  said,  “and  i  understand  those
coons  start  stirring  pretty  early. you  had
better be going, hadn’t you?”

while mama was bundling me up, papa
lit my lantern. he handed it to me, saying,
“i’d  like  to  see  a  big  coonskin  on  the
smokehouse wall in the morning.”

the  whole  family  followed  me  out  on
the porch. there we all got a surprise. my
dogs were sitting on the steps, waiting for
me.

i  heard  papa  laugh.  “why,  they  know
you’re going hunting,” he said, “know it as
well as anything.”

“well,  i  never,”  said  mama.  “do  you
really think they do? it does look like they
do. why, just look at them.”

little  ann

stopped, turned around, and looked at me.
“sure they know billy’s going hunting,”

piped the little one, “and i know why.”

“how  do  you  know  so  much,  silly?”

asked the oldest one.

“because i told little ann, that’s why,”
she  said,  “and  she  told  old  dan.  that’s
how they know.”

we all had to laugh at her.
the last thing i heard as i left the house
was the voice of my mother. “be careful,
billy,” she said, “and don’t stay out late.”
it was a beautiful night, still and frosty.
a  big  grinning  ozark  moon  had  the
countryside bathed in a soft yellow glow.
the starlit heaven reminded me of a large
blue  umbrella,  outspread  and  with  the
handle broken off.

just  before  i  reached  the  timber,  i

called my dogs to me. “now the trail will
be a little different tonight,” i whispered.
“it won’t be a hide dragged on the ground.
it’ll  be  the  real  thing,  so  remember
everything i taught you and i’m depending
on you. just put one up a tree and i’ll do
the rest.”

i  turned  them  loose,  saying,  “go  get

’em.”

they streaked for the timber.
by  the  time  i  had  reached  the  river,
every nerve in my body was drawn up as
tight as a fiddlestring. big-eyed and with
ears open, i walked on, stopping now and
then  to  listen.  the  way  i  was  slipping
along  anyone  would  have  thought  i  was
trying to slip up on a coon myself.

i had never seen a night so peaceful and
tall  sycamores

still.  all  around  me

in

like  white  streamers

the
gleamed
moonlight.  a  prowling
skunk  came
wobbling  up  the  riverbank.  he  stopped
when he saw me. i smiled at the fox-fire
glow  of  his  small,  beady,  red  eyes.  he
turned and disappeared in the underbrush.
i heard a sharp snap and a feathery rustle
in  some  brush  close  by.  a  small  rodent
started  squealing  in  agony. a  night  hawk
had found his supper.

across  the  river  and  from  far  back  in
the rugged mountains i heard the baying of
a  hound.  i  wondered  if  it  was  the  same
one i had heard from my window on those
nights so long ago.

although  my  eyes  were  seeing  the
wonders  of  the  night,  my  ears  were  ever
alert, listening for the sound of my hounds
telling me they had found a trail.

i  was  expecting  one  of  them  to  bawl,
but when it came it startled me. the deep
tones  of  old  dan’s  voice  jarred  the
silence  around  me.  i  dropped  my  ax  and
almost  dropped  my  lantern.  a  strange
feeling came over me. i took a deep breath
and threw back my head to give the call of
the hunter, but something went wrong. my
throat felt like it had been tied in a knot. i
swallowed a couple of times and the knot
disappeared.

as loud as i could, i whooped, “who-

e-e-e. get him, dan. get him.”

little ann came in. the bell-like tones
of  her  voice  made  shivers  run  up  and
down my spine. i whooped to her. “who-
e-e-e.  tell  it  to  him,  little  girl.  tell  it  to
him.”

this was what i had prayed for, worked

and  sweated  for,  my  own  little  hounds
bawling  on  the  trail  of  a  river  coon.  i
don’t know why i cried, but i did. while
the  tears  rolled,  i  whooped  again  and
again.

they  straightened  the  trail  out  and
headed down river. i took off after them as
fast as i could run.

a mile downstream the coon pulled his
first trick. i could tell by my dogs’ voices
that they had lost the trail. when i came to
them they were out on an old drift, sniffing
around.

the coon had pulled a simple trick. he
had  run  out  on  the  drift,  leaped  into  the
water,  and  crossed  the  river.  to  an
experienced  coon  hound,  the  crude  trick
would  have  been  nothing  at  all,  but  my
dogs  were
just  big,  awkward  pups,

trailing their first live coon.

i stood and watched, wondering if they
would  remember  the  training  i  had  given
them.  now  and  then  i  would  whoop,
urging them on.

old  dan  was  having  a  fit.  he  whined
and he bawled. he whimpered and cried.
he came to me and reared up, begging for
help.

little ann came to me. i could see the
pleading  in  her  warm  gray  eyes.  “i’m
ashamed  of  you,  little  girl,”  i  said.  “i

“i’m not going to help you,” i scolded,
“and  you’re  not  going  to  find  him  out  on
that  drift.  if  you  would  just  remember
some of the training i gave you, you could
find the trail. now go find that coon.”

he ran back out on the drift and started

searching.

thought  you  had  more  sense  than  this.  if
you  let  him  fool  you  this  easily,  you’ll
never be a coon dog.”

and

she  whined,

trotted
downstream  to  search  again  for  the  lost
trail.

turned,

i  couldn’t  understand.  had  all  the
training  i  had  given  them  been  useless?  i
knew  if  i  waded  the  river  they  would
follow  me.  once  on  the  other  side,  it
would be easy for them to find the trail. i
didn’t want it that way. i wanted them to
figure  it  out  by  themselves.  the  more  i
thought  about  it,  the  more  disgusted  i
became. i sat down and buried my face in
my arms.

out  on  the  drift,  old  dan  started
whining. it made me angry and i got up to
scold him again.

i  couldn’t  understand  his  actions.  he
was  running  along  the  edge  of  the  drift,
whimpering  and  staring  downriver.  i
looked  that  way.  i  could  see  something
swimming for the opposite shore. at first i
thought it was a muskrat. in the middle of
the  stream,  where  the  moonlight  was  the
brightest, i got a good look. it was little
ann.

with  a  loud  whoop,  i  told  her  how
little  girl  had

i  was.  my

proud
remembered her training.

she came out on a gravel bar, shook the
water from her body, and disappeared in
the thick timber. minutes later, she let me
know  she  had  found  the  trail.  before  the
tones  of  her  voice  had  died  away,  old
dan  plowed  into  the  water.  he  was  so
eager to join her i could hear him whining

as  soon  as  his  feet  touched  bottom  in
the  shallows,  he  started  bawling  and
lunging.  white  sheets  of  water,  knocked
high in the moonlight by his churning feet,
gleamed like thousands of tiny white stars.
he  came  out  of  the  river  onto  a  sand
bar.  in  his  eagerness,  his  feet  slipped  in
the  loose  sand  and  down  he  went.  he
came out of his roll, running and bawling.
ahead  of  him  was  a  log  jam.  he  sailed
over
the
riverbank. seconds later i heard his deep
voice blend with the sharp cries of little
ann.

it  and  disappeared  down

as he swam.

at  that  moment  no  boy  in  the  world
could  have  been  more  proud  of  his  dogs
than  i  was.  never  again  would  i  doubt
them.

i  was  hurrying  along,  looking  for  a
shallow  riffle  so  i  could  wade  across,
when  the  voices  of  my  dogs  stopped.  i
waited and listened. they opened again on
my  side  of  the  stream.  the  coon  had
crossed back over.

i  couldn’t  help  smiling.  i  knew  that
never again would a ringtail fool them by
swimming the river.

the next trick the old fellow pulled was
dandy.  he  climbed  a  large  water  oak
standing about ten feet from the river and
simply disappeared.

i  got  there  in  time  to  see  my  dogs
swimming for the opposite shore. for half
an hour they worked that bank. not finding
the  trail,  they  swam  back.  i  stood  and
watched  them.  they  practically  tore  the
riverbank to pieces looking for the trail.

old dan knew the coon had climbed the
water oak. he went back, reared up on it,
and bawled a few times.

“there’s  no  use  in  doing  that,  boy,”  i
said.  “i  know  he  climbed  it,  but  he’s  not
there now. maybe it’s like grandpa said,
he just climbed right on out through the top
and disappeared in the stars.”

my dogs didn’t know it, but i was pretty
well  convinced  that  that  was  what  the
coon had done.

they wouldn’t give up. once again they
crossed over to the other shore. it was no
use.  the  coon  hadn’t  touched  that  bank.
they  came  back.  old  dan  went  up  the
river and little ann worked downstream.
an  hour  and  a  half  later  they  gave  up
and  came  to  me  begging  for  help.  i  knelt
down  between  their  wet  bodies.  while  i

“i’m not mad,” i said. “i know you did
your best. if that coon can fool both of us,
then we’re just beat. we’ll go someplace
else  to  hunt.  he’s  not  the  only  coon  in
these bottoms.”

just  as  i  picked  up  my  ax  and  lantern,
little  ann  let  out  a  bawl  and  tore  out
down  the  riverbank.  old  dan,  with  a
bewildered  look  on  his  face,  stood  for  a
moment  looking  after  her.  then,  raising
his  head  high  in  the  air,  he  made  my
eardrums ring with his deep voice. i could
hear  the  underbrush  popping  as  he  ran  to
join her.

scratched and petted them, i let them know
that i still loved them.

i  couldn’t  figure  out  what  had  taken
place. surely little ann had heard or seen
something. i could tell by their voices that

whatever it was they were after, they were
close enough to see it and were probably
running by sight.

the animal left the bottoms and headed
for the mountains. whatever it was, it must
have  realized  my  dogs  were  crowding  it
too closely. at the edge of the foothills it
turned and came back toward the river.

i was still trying to figure out what was
going on, when i realized that on striking
the river the animal had again turned and
was  coming  straight  toward  me.  i  set  my
lantern down and tightened my grip on the
ax.

i  was  standing  my  ground  quite  well
when visions of bears, lions, and all kinds
of other animals started flashing across my
mind. i jumped behind a big sycamore and
was trying hard to press my body into the

tree  when  a  big  coon  came  tearing  by.
twenty-five  yards  behind  him  came  my
dogs,  running  side  by  side.  i  saw  them
clearly  when  they  passed  me,  bawling
every time their feet touched the ground.

after seeing that there was nothing to be
scared  of,  once  again  i  was  the  fearless
hunter, screaming and yelling as loud as i
could, “get him, boy, get him.”

i tore out after them. the trails i knew
so well were forgotten. i took off straight
through  the  brush.  i  was  tearing  my  way
through  some  elders  when  the  voices  of
my dogs stopped.

holding  my  breath,  i  stood  still  and
waited. then it came, the long-drawn-out
bawl of the tree bark. my little hounds had
done it. they had treed their first coon.

when i came to them and saw what they

had done i was speechless. i groaned and
closed my eyes. i didn’t want to believe it.
there were a lot of big sycamores in the
bottoms but the one in which my dogs had
treed was the giant of them all.

next, i named it “the giant.” that name

while  prowling  the  woods,  i  had  seen
the  big  tree  many  times.  i  had  always
stopped and admired it. like a king in his
own  domain,  it  towered  far  above  the
smaller trees.

it had taken me quite a while to find a
name suitable for the big sycamore. for a
while i had called it “the chicken tree.” in
some  ways  it  had  reminded  me  of  a
mother  hen  hovering  over  her  young  in  a
rainstorm. its huge limbs spread out over
the small birch, ash, box elder, and water
oak as if it alone were their protector.

didn’t last long. mama told us children a
story  about  a  big  giant  that  lived  in  the
mountains and ate little children that were
lost.  right  away  i  started  looking  for
another name.

one  day,  while  lying  in  the  warm  sun
staring  at  its  magnificent  beauty,  i  found
the perfect name. from that day on, it was
called “the big tree.” i named the bottoms
around it “the big tree bottoms.”

walking around it, and using the moon
as  a  light,  i  started  looking  for  the  coon.
high up in the top i saw a hollow in the
end  of  a  broken  limb.  i  figured  that  that
was the coon’s den.

i could climb almost any tree i had ever
seen  but  i  knew  i  could  never  climb  the
big  sycamore  and  it  would  take  days  to
chop it down.

i turned to walk away. my hounds made
no move to follow. they started whining.
old dan reared up, placed his front paws
on the trunk, and started bawling.

“i know he’s there,” i said, “but there’s
nothing i can do. i can’t climb it. why it’s
sixty feet up to the first limb and it would
take me a month to cut it down.”

there had been very little hope from the
beginning, but on seeing the hollow i gave
up.  “come  on,”  i  said  to  my  dogs.
“there’s  nothing  i  can  do.  we’ll  go
someplace else and find another coon.”

again i turned and started on my way.
little ann  came  to  me.  she  reared  up
and started licking my hands. swallowing
the  knot  in  my  throat,  i  said,  “i’m  sorry,
little girl. i want him just as badly as you
do, but there’s no way i can get him.”

she  ran  back  to  the  tree  and  started
digging  in  the  soft  ground  close  to  the
roots.

“come on now,” i said in a gruff voice.
“you’re  both  acting  silly. you  know  i’d
get the coon for you if i could but i can’t.”
with  a  whipped-dog  look  on  her  face
and with her tail between her legs, little
ann came over. she wouldn’t even look at
me.  old  dan  walked  slowly  around
behind  the  tree  and  hid  himself.  he
peeped around the big trunk and looked at
me.  the  message  i  read  in  his  friendly
eyes  tore  at  my  heart.  he  seemed  to  be
saying,  “you  told  us  to  put  one  in  a  tree
and you would do the rest.”

with tears in my eyes, i looked again at
the big sycamore. a wave of anger came
over me. gritting my teeth, i said, “i don’t

care how big you are, i’m not going to let
my  dogs  down.  i  told  them  if  they  put  a
coon in a tree i would do the rest and i’m
going  to.  i’m  going  to  cut  you  down.  i
don’t care if it takes me a whole year.”

i walked over and sank my ax as deep
as  i  could  in  the  smooth  white  bark.  my
dogs threw a fit. little ann started turning
in  circles.  i  could  hear  her  pleased
whimpering  cry.  old  dan  bawled  and
started gnawing on the big tree’s trunk.

at  first  it  was  easy.  my  ax  was  sharp
and the chips flew. two hours later things
were different. my arms felt like two dead
grapevines, and my back felt like someone
had pulled a plug out of one end of it and
drained all the sap out.

while  taking  a  breather,  i  saw  i  was
making  more  progress  than  i  thought  i

would.  the  cut  i  had  started  was  a  foot
deep, but i still had a long way to go.

little ann woke me up by washing my

sitting  on  their  rears,  my  dogs  waited
and watched. i smiled at the look on their
faces. every time i stopped chopping they
would  come  over.  while  little  ann
washed the sweat from my face, old dan
would inspect my work. he seemed to be
pleased  with  what  he  saw  for  he  always
wagged his tail.

along  about  daylight  i  got  my  second
wind and i really did make the chips fly.
this  burst  of  energy  cost  me  dearly.  by
sunup i was so stiff i could hardly move.
my hands and arms were numb. my back
screamed with pain. i could go no further.
sitting down, i leaned back against the big
tree and fell asleep.

face. i groaned with the torture of getting
to  my  feet.  every  muscle  in  my  body
seemed to be tied in a knot. i was thinking
of  going  down  to  the  river  to  wash  my
face in the cool water when i heard a loud
whoop.  i  recognized  my  father’s  voice.  i
whooped to let him know where i was.

papa was riding our red mule. after he
rode  up,  he  just  sat  there  and  looked  me
over. he glanced at my dogs and at the big
sycamore. i saw the worry leave his face.
he  straightened  his  shoulders,  pursed  his
lips,  and  blew  out  a
little  air.  he
reminded  me  of  someone  who  had  just
dropped a heavy load.

in  a  slow,  calm  voice,  he  asked,  “are

you all right, billy?”

“yes,  papa,”  i  said.  “oh,  i’m  a  little

tired and sleepy, otherwise i’m fine.”

he slid from the mule’s back and came
over.  “your  mother’s  worried,”  he  said.
“when  you  didn’t  come  in,  we  didn’t
know what had happened. you should’ve
come home.”

i didn’t know what to say. i bowed my
head  and  looked  at  the  ground.  i  was
trying hard to choke back the tears when i
felt his hand on my shoulder.

i nodded my head.
“is there a coon in it?” he asked.
“there sure is, papa,” i said. “he’s in

“i’m  not  scolding,”  he  said.  “we  just
thought  maybe  you  had  an  accident  or
something.”

i looked up and saw a smile on his face.
he turned and looked again at the tree.
“say,” he said, “this is the sycamore you
call ‘the big tree,’ isn’t it?”

that  hollow  limb.  see—that  one  way  up
there. that’s why i couldn’t come home. i
was afraid he’d get away.”

“maybe you just think he’s there,” papa
said.  “i  believe  i’d  make  sure  before  i’d
cut down a tree that big.”

“oh,  he’s  there  all  right,”  i  said.  “my
dogs weren’t ten feet behind him when he
went up it.”

“why are you so determined to get this
coon?”  papa  asked.  “couldn’t  you  go
somewhere else and tree one? maybe the
tree would be a smaller one.”

“i thought about that, papa,” i said, “but
i made a bargain with my dogs. i told them
that if they would put one in a tree, i’d do
the  rest.  well,  they  fulfilled  their  part  of
the  bargain.  now  it’s  up  to  me  to  do  my
part, and i’m going to, papa. i’m going to

cut  it  down.  i  don’t  care  if  it  takes  me  a
year.”

papa  laughed  and  said,  “oh,  i  don’t
think it’ll take that long, but it will take a
while. i tell you what i‘ll do. you take the
mule and go get some breakfast. i’ll chop
on it until you get back.”

“no,  papa,”  i  said.  “i  don’t  want  any
help. i want to cut it down all by myself.
you see, if someone helps me, i wouldn’t
feel like i kept my part of the agreement.”
an  astonished  look  came  over  my
father’s face. “why, billy,” he said, “you
can’t  stay  down  here  without  anything  to
eat  and  no  sleep.  besides,  it’ll  take  at
least  two  days  to  cut  that  tree  down  and
that’s hard work.”

“please,  papa,”  i  begged,  “don’t  make
me  quit.  i  just  have  to  get  that  coon.  if  i

don’t, my dogs won’t ever believe in me
again.”

papa  didn’t  know  what  to  tell  me.  he
scratched  his  head,  looked  over  to  my
dogs  and  back  at  me.  he  started  walking
around.  i  waited  for  him  to  make  up  his
mind. he finally reached a decision.

“well, all right,” he said.” if that’s the
way  you  want  it,  i’m  for  it  even  if  it  is
only  an  agreement  between  you  and  your
dogs. if a man’s word isn’t any good, he’s
no good himself.

“now  i  have  to  get  back  and  tell  your
mother  that  you’re  all  right.  it’s  a  cinch
that you can’t do that kind of work on an
empty  stomach,  so  i’ll  send  your  oldest
sister down with a lunch bucket.”

with  tears  in  my  eyes,  i  said,  “tell
mama i’m sorry for not coming home last

night.”

“don’t  you  worry  about  your  mother,”
he said, as he climbed on the mule’s back.
“i’ll take care of her. another thing, i have
to  make  a  trip  to  the  store  today  and  i’ll
talk  this  over  with  your  grandfather.  he
may be able to help some way.”

after  papa  left,  things  were  a  little
different. the tree didn’t look as big, and
my ax wasn’t as heavy. i even managed to
sing a little as i chopped away.

when  my  sister  came  with  the  lunch
bucket,  i  could  have  kissed  her,  but  i
didn’t.  she  took  one  look  at  the  big  tree
and her blue eyes got as big as a guinea’s
egg.

crazy,”

“you’re

gasped,
“absolutely crazy. why, it’ll take a month
to  cut  that  tree  down,  and  all  for  an  old

coon.”

i was so busy with the fresh side pork,
fried  eggs,  and  hot  biscuits,  i  didn’t  pay
much attention to her. after all, she was a
girl, and girls don’t think like boys do.

she raved on. “you can’t possibly cut it
down today, and what are you going to do
when it gets dark?”

“i’m going to keep right on chopping,” i
said. “i stayed with it last night, didn’t i?
well,  i’ll  stay  till  it’s  cut  down.  i  don’t
care how long it takes.”

my sister got upset. she looked at me,
threw back her small head, and looked up
to the top of the big sycamore. “you’re as
crazy  as  a  bedbug,”  she  said.  “why,  i
never heard of such a thing.”

she  stepped  over  in  front  of  me  and
very seriously asked if she could look in

my eyes.

“look  in  my  eyes?”  i  said.  “what  do

you want to do that for? i’m not sick.”

“yes,  you  are,  billy,”  she  said,  “very
sick.  mama  said  when  old  man  johnson
went crazy, his eyes turned green. i want
to see if yours have.”

this was too much. “if you don’t get out
of  here,”  i  shouted,  “you’re  going  to  be
red instead of green, and i mean that.”

i grabbed up a stick and started toward
her. of course, i wouldn’t have hit her for
anything.

this scared her and she started for the
house. i heard her saying something about
an  old  coon  as  she  disappeared  in  the
underbrush.

down in the bottom of my lunch bucket
i found a neat little package of scraps for

my dogs. while they were eating i walked
down  to  a  spring  and  filled  the  bucket
with cool water.

the  food  did  wonders  for  me.  my
strength  came  back.  i  spit  on  my  hands
and,  whistling  a  coon  hunter’s  tune,  i
started making the chips fly.

the  cut  grew  so  big  i  could  have  laid
down in it. i moved over to another side
and started a new one. once while i was
taking  a  rest,  old  dan  came  over  to
inspect my work. he hopped up in the cut
and sniffed around.

“you had better get out of there,” i said.
“if  that  tree  takes  a  notion  to  fall,  it’ll
mash you flatter than a tadpole’s tail.”

with  a  “no  care”  look  on  his  friendly
face, he gave me a hurry-up signal with a
wag of his tail.

little  ann  had  dug  a  bed  in  a  pile  of
dead  leaves.  she  looked  as  if  she  were
asleep but i knew she wasn’t. every time i
stopped swinging the ax, she would raise
her head and look at me.

ix

by  late  evening  the  happy  tune  i  had  been
whistling was forgotten. my back throbbed
like  a  stone  bruise.  the  muscles  in  my
legs  and  arms  started  quivering  and
jerking. i couldn’t gulp enough air to cool
the burning heat in my lungs. my strength
was gone. i could go no further.

i  sat  down  and  called  my  dogs  to  me.
with  tears  in  my  eyes,  i  told  them  that  i
just couldn’t cut the big tree down.

i’m  sure  no  one  in  the  world  can
like  his

it was grandpa in his buggy.

to  make

grandfather  can.  he  drove  up  with  a
twinkle  in  his  eyes  and  a  smile  on  his
whiskery old face.

“hello! how are you gettin’ along?” he

boomed.

“not  so  good,  grandpa,”  i  said.  “i
don’t think i can cut it down. it’s just too
big. i guess i’ll have to give up.”

“give  up!”  grandpa  barked.  “now  i
don’t  want  to  hear  you  say  that.  no,  sir,
that’s  the  last  thing  i  want  to  hear.  don’t
ever start anything you can’t finish.”

“i  don’t  want  to  give  up,  grandpa,”  i
said,  “but  it’s  just  too  big  and  my
strength’s gone. i’m give out.”

“course  you  are,”  he  said.  “you’ve
been  going  at  it  wrong.  to  do  work  like
that a fellow needs plenty of rest and food
in his stomach.”

“how am i going to get that, grandpa?”
i asked. “i can’t leave the tree. if i do, the
coon will get away.”

“no, he won’t,” grandpa said. “that’s
what i came down here for. i’ll show you
how to keep that coon in the tree.”

he  walked  around  the  big  sycamore,
looking  up.  he  whistled  and  said,  “boy,
this is a big one all right.”

“yes,  it  is,  grandpa,”  i  said.  “it’s  the

biggest one in the river bottoms.”

grandpa  started  chuckling.  “that’s  all
right,”  he  said.  “the  bigger  they  are  the
harder they fall.”

“how  are  you  going  to  make  the  coon

stay in the tree, grandpa?” i asked.

with a proud look on his face, he said,
“that’s  another  one  of  my  coon-hunting
tricks; learned it when i was a boy. we’ll

keep him there all right. oh, i don’t mean
we  can  keep  him  there  for  always,  but
he’ll  stay  for  four  or  five  days.  that  is,
until he gets so hungry he just has to come
down.”

“i  don’t  need  that  much  time,”  i  said.
“i’m  pretty  sure  i  can  have  it  down  by
tomorrow night.”

grandpa laughed. “speaking of meals,”
he  said,  “your  ma  is  having  chicken  and

grandpa  looked  at  the  cut.  “i  don’t
know,” he said. “even though it is halfway
down,  you  must  remember  you’ve  been
cutting on it half of one night and one day.
you might make it, but it’s going to take a
lot of chopping.”

“if  i  get  a  good  night’s  sleep,”  i  said,
“and  a  couple  of  meals  under  my  belt,  i
can do a lot of chopping.”

dumplings for supper. now we don’t want
to miss that, so let’s get busy.”

“what  do  you  want  me

to  do,

grandpa?” i asked.

“well,  let’s  see,”  he  said.  “first  thing
we’ll  need  is  some  sticks  about  five  feet
long.  take  your  ax,  go  over  in  that
canebrake, and get us six of them.”

i  hurried  to  do  what  grandpa  wanted,
all the time wondering what in the world
he  was  going  to  do.  how  could  he  keep
the coon in the tree?

when i came back, he was taking some
old  clothes  from  the  buggy.  “take  this
stocking cap,” he said. “fill it about half-
full of grass and leaves.”
while  i  was  doing

this,  grandpa
walked over and started looking up in the
tree.  “you’re  pretty  sure  he’s  in  that

hollow limb, are you?” he asked.

“he’s there all right, grandpa,” i said.
“there’s no other place he could be. i’ve
looked  all  over  it  and  there’s  no  other
hollow anywhere.”

“well,  in  that  case,”  grandpa  said,
“we’d  better  put  our  man  along  about
here.”

“what  man,  grandpa?”  i  asked  in

surprise.

“the  one  we’re  going  to  make,”  he
said.  “to  us  it’ll  be  a  scarecrow,  but  to
that coon it’ll be a man.”

right  away

knowing  too  well  how  smart  coons
were,
lose
confidence. “i don’t see how anything like
that can keep a coon in a tree,” i said.

i  began

“it’ll keep him there all right,” grandpa
said.  “like  i  told  you  before,  they’re

to

curious  little  devils.  he’ll  poke  his  head
out  of  that  hole,  see  this  man  standing
here, and he won’t dare come down. it’ll
take him four or five days to figure out that
it isn’t a real honest-to-goodness man. by
that time it’ll be too late. you’ll have his
hide tacked on the smokehouse wall.”

the more i thought about it, the more i
believed it, and then there was that serious
look  on  grandpa’s  face.  that  was  all  it
took. i was firmly convinced.

i  started  laughing.  the  more  i  thought
about  it,  the  funnier  it  got.  great  big
laughing tears rolled down my cheek.

“what’s  so  funny?”  grandpa  asked.

“don’t you believe it’ll work?”

“sure  it’ll  work,  grandpa,”  i  said.  “i
know  it  will.  i  was  just  thinking—those
coons  aren’t  half  as  smart  as  they  think

they are, are they?”

we both had a good laugh at this.
with the sticks and some bailing wire,
grandpa made a frame that looked almost
like a gingerbread man. on this he put an
old  pair  of  pants  and  a  red  sweater.  we
stuffed the loose flabby clothes with grass
and  leaves.  he  wired  the  stocking-cap
head in place and stepped back to inspect
his work.

“well,  what  do  you  think  of  it?”  he

asked.

“if it had a face,” i said, “you couldn’t

tell it from a real man.”

“we can fix that,” grandpa chuckled.
he  took  a  stick  and  dug  some  black
grease  from  one  of  the  hub  caps  on  the
buggy.  i  stood  and  watched  while  he
applied his artistic touch. in the stocking-

cap head he made two mean-looking eyes,
a  crooked  nose,  and  the  ugliest  mouth  i
had ever seen.

“well,  what  do  you  think  of  that?”  he

asked. “looks pretty good, huh?”

laughing fit to kill, and talking all at the
same  time,  i  told  him  that  i  wouldn’t
blame  the  coon  if  he  stayed  in  the  tree
until gabriel blew his horn.

“he  won’t  stay  that  long,”  grandpa
chuckled,  “but  he’ll  stay  long  enough  for
you to cut that tree down.”

“that’s all i want,” i said.
“we’d better be going,” grandpa said.
“it’s  getting  late  and  we  don’t  want  to
miss that supper.”

i  was  so  stiff  and  sore  he  had  to  help

me to the buggy seat.

i  called  to  my  dogs.  little  ann  came,

but  not  willingly.  old  dan  refused  to
leave the tree.

“come  on,  boy,”  i  coaxed.  “let’s  go
home  and  get  something  to  eat.  we’ll
come back tomorrow.”

he  bowed  his  head  and  looked  the

“come  on,”  i  scolded,  “we  can’t  sit

other way.

here all night.”

this  hurt  his  feelings.  he  walked

around behind the big sycamore and hid.

“well, i’ll be darned,” grandpa said as
he  jumped  down  from  the  buggy.  “he
knows  that  coon’s  there  and  he  doesn’t
want to leave it. you’ve got a coon hound
there and i mean a good one.”

he picked old dan up in his arms and

set him in the buggy.

all the way home i had to hold on to his

as our buggy wound its way up through
the bottoms, grandpa started talking. “you
know,  billy,”  he  said,  “about  this  tree-
chopping of yours, i think it’s all right. in
fact, i think it would be a good thing if all
young boys had to cut down a big tree like
that  once  in  their  life.  it  does  something
for them. it gives them determination and
will power. that’s a good thing for a man
to have. it goes a long way in his life. the
american  people  have  a  lot  of  it.  they
have  proved
through
history, but they could do with a lot more
of it.”

that,  all  down

collar  to  keep  him  from  jumping  out  and
going back to the tree.

i  couldn’t  see  this  determination  and
will  power  that  grandpa  was  talking
about very clearly. all i could see was a

big sycamore tree, a lot of chopping, and
the  hide  of  a  ringtail  coon  that  i  was
determined to have.

as we reached the house, mama came
out.  right  away  she  started  checking  me
over. “are you all right?” she asked.

“sure, mama,” i said. “what makes you

think something’s wrong with me?”

“well,  i  didn’t  know,”  she  said.  “the
way  you  acted  when  you  got  down  from
the buggy, i thought maybe you were hurt.”
“aw,  he’s  just  a  little  sore  and  stiff
from  all  that  chopping,”  grandpa  said,
“but  he’ll  be  all  right.  that’ll  soon  go
away.”

after  mama  saw  that  there  were  no
broken  bones,  or  legs  chopped  off,  she
smiled and said, “i never know any more.
i guess i’ll just have to get used to it.”

papa  hollered  from  the  porch,  “come
on  in.  we’ve  been  waiting  supper  on
you.”

“we’re having chicken and dumplings,”
them

mama  beamed,  “and  i  cooked
especially for you.”

during the meal i told grandpa i didn’t
think that the coon in the big tree was the
same  one  my  dogs  had  been  trailing  at
first.

“what makes you think that?” he asked.
i told how the coon had fooled us and
how  little  ann  had  seen  or  heard  this
other coon. i figured he had just walked up
on my dogs before he realized it.

a  smile  spread  all  over  grandpa’s
face. chuckling, he said, “it does look that
way,  but  it  wasn’t.  no,  billy,  it  was  the
same  coon.  they’re  much  too  smart  to

ever  walk  up  on  a  hound  like  that.  he
pulled  a  trick  and  it  was  a  good  one.  in
fact, it’ll fool nine out of ten dogs.”

“well,  what  did  he  do,  grandpa?”  i
asked. “i’m pretty sure he didn’t cross the
river, so how did he work it?”

grandpa  pushed  the  dishes  back  and,
using  his  fork  as  a  pencil,  he  drew  an
imaginary  line  on  the  tablecloth.  “it’s
called  the  backtracking  trick,”  he  said.
“here’s  how  he  worked  it.  he  climbed
that water oak but he only went up about
fifteen  or  twenty  feet.  he  then  turned
around and came down in his same tracks.
he backtracked on his original trail for a
way. when he heard your dogs coming he
leaped  far  up  on  the  side  of  the  nearest
tree  and  climbed  up.  he  was  in  that  tree
all the time your dogs were searching for

the lost trail. after everything had quieted
down,  he  figured  that  they  had  given  up.
that’s  when  he  came  down  and  that’s
when little ann either heard or saw him.”
pointing  the  fork  at  me,  grandpa  said
very  seriously,  “you  mark  my  word,
billy, in no time at all that little ann will
know every trick a coon can pull.”

“you  know,  grandpa,”  i  said,  “she
wouldn’t bark treed at the water oak like
old dan did.”

“course  she  wouldn’t,”  he  said.  “she

knew he wasn’t there.”

“why,  i  never  heard  of  such  a  thing,”
mama said. “i’d no idea coons were that
smart. why, for all anyone knows he may
not  be  in  the  big  tree  at  all.  maybe  he
pulled  another  trick.  it’d  be  a  shame  if
billy cut it down and found there was no

coon in it.”

“oh,  he’s

there,  mama,”  i  hastily
replied. “i know he is. they were right on
his  tail  when  he  went  up.  besides,  little
ann  was  bawling  her  head  off  when  i
came to them.”

“of  course  he’s  there,”  grandpa  said.
“they were crowding him too closely. he
didn’t have time to pull another trick.”

grandpa  left  soon  after  supper,  saying
to  me,  “i’ll  be  back  down  in  a  few  days
and i want to see that coon hide.”

i  thanked  him  for  helping  me  and

walked out to the buggy with him.

“oh, i almost forgot,” he said. “i heard
there was a fad back in the new england
states. seems like everyone is going crazy
over coonskin coats. now if this is true, i
look for the price of coon hides to take a

i  was  happy  to  hear  this  and  told  my
father  what  grandpa  had  said.  papa
laughed and said, “well, if you can keep
the coons out of those big sycamores, you
might make a little money.”

before  i  went  to  bed,  mama  made  me
take  a  hot  bath.  then  she  rubbed  me  all
over  with  some  liniment  that  burned  like
fire and smelled like a civet cat.

eyes when mama woke me up. “breakfast

putting my clothes on. mama helped me.

“maybe you’d better let that coon go,”
she  said.  “i  don’t  think  he’s  worth  all  of
this.”

“i  can’t  do  that,  mama,”  i  said.  “i’ve

the matter?” he asked. “you a little stiff?”
“a little stiff!” mama exclaimed. “why

he could hardly put his clothes on.”

“aw, he’ll be all right,” papa said. “if i
know  anything  about  swinging  an  ax,  it
won’t be long before he’s as limber as a
rag.”

mama  just  shook  her  head  and  started

putting our breakfast on the table.

while we were eating, papa said, “you
know  i  woke  up  several  times  last  night
and each time i was sure i heard a hound
bawling. it sounded like old dan.”

i  quit  the  table  on  the  run  and  headed
for  my  doghouse.  i  didn’t  have  to  go  all
the way. little ann met me on the porch. i
asked her where old dan was and called

his name. he was nowhere around.

little ann started acting strangely. she
whined  and  stared

back, and reared up on me.

i ran and looked. he wasn’t there.
“everybody be quiet and listen,” i said.
i  walked  out  beyond  the  gate  a  little
ways and whooped as loud as i could. my
voice  rang  like  a  bell  in  the  still,  frosty
morning.  before  the  echo  had  died  away
the deep “ou-u-u-u” of old dan rolled out

“he’s  there,”  i  said.  “he  wanted  to
make sure the coon stayed in the tree. you
see, mama, why i have to get that coon. i
can’t let him down.”

“well, i never in all my life,” she said.
“i  had  no  idea  a  dog  loved  to  hunt  that
much.  yes,  billy,  i  can  see  now,  and  i
want  you  to  get  him.  i  don’t  care  if  you
have  to  cut  down  every  tree  in  those
bottoms.  i  want  you  to  get  that  coon  for
those dogs.”

of the river bottoms.

“i’m  going  to  get  him,  mama,”  i  said,
“and  i’m  going  to  get  him  today  if  i
possibly can.”

papa  laughed  and  said,  “looks  like
there  wasn’t  any  use  in  building  that
scarecrow. all you had to do was tell old
dan to stay and watch the tree.”

i left the house in a run. now and then i
would  stop  and  whoop.  each  time  i  was
answered by the deep voice of old dan.

little ann ran ahead of me. by the time
i  reached  the  big  tree,  their  voices  were
making the bottoms ring.

when  i  came

tearing  out  of

the
underbrush, old dan threw a fit. he tried
to  climb  the  sycamore.  he  would  back
way off, then, bawling and running as fast
as he could, he would claw his way far up
on its side.

little ann, not to be outdone, reared up
and  placed  her  small  front  paws  on  the
smooth  white  bark.  she  told  the  ringtail
coon that she knew he was there.

after  they  had  quieted  down,  i  called
old dan to me. “i’m proud of you, boy,” i
said.  “it  takes  a  good  dog  to  stay  with  a

tree all night, but there wasn’t any need in
you coming back. the coon wouldn’t have
gotten  away.  that’s  why  we  built  the
scarecrow.”

little ann came over and started rolling
in  the  leaves.  the  way  i  was  feeling
toward  her,  i  couldn’t  even  smile  at  her
playful mood. “of course you feel good,”
i  said  in  an  irritated  voice,  “and  it’s  no
wonder, you had a good night’s sleep in a
nice warm doghouse, but old dan didn’t.
he  was  down  here  in  the  cold  all  by
himself, watching the tree. the way you’re
acting, i don’t believe you care if the coon
gets away or not.”

i would have said more but just then i
noticed  something.  i  walked  over  for  a
better  look.  there,  scratched  deep  in  the
soft leaves were two little beds. one was

old dan hadn’t been alone when he had
gone  back  to  the  tree.  she  too  had  gone
along. there was no doubt that in the early
morning she had come home to get me.

there was a lump in my throat as i said,
“i’m sorry, little girl, i should’ve known.”
the first half-hour was torture. at each
swing  of  the  ax  my  arms  felt  like  they
were  being  torn  from  their  sockets.  i
gritted  my  teeth  and  kept  hacking  away.
my body felt like it did the time my sister
rolled me down the hill in a barrel.

smaller  than  the  other.  looking  at  little
ann, i read the answer in her warm gray
eyes.

as papa had said, in a little while the
warm  heat  from  the  hard  work  limbered
me  up.  i  remembered  what  my  father  did
when  he  was  swinging  an  ax.  at  the

completion of each swing, he always said,
“ha!”  i  tried  it.  ker-wham.  “ha!”  ker-
wham. “ha!” i don’t know if it helped or
not, but i was willing to try anything if it
would hurry the job.

several times before noon i had to stop
and  rake  my  chips  out  of  the  way.  i
noticed  that  they  weren’t  the  big,  even,
solid  chips  like  my  father  made  when  he
was  chopping.  they  were  small  and
seemed  to  crumble  up  and  come  all  to
pieces.  neither  were  the  cuts  neat  and
even. they were ragged and looked more
like  the  work  of  beavers.  but  i  wasn’t
interested  in  any  beautiful  tree-chopping.
all i wanted was to hear the big sycamore
start popping.

along  in  the  middle  of  the  afternoon  i
felt a stinging in one of my hands. when i

saw it was a blister i almost cried. at first
there  was  only  one.  then  two.  one  after
another  they  rose  up  on  my  hands  like
small  white  marbles.  they  filled  up  and
turned  a  pale  pinkish  color.  when  one
would burst, it was all i could do to keep
from screaming. i tore my handkerchief in
half  and  wrapped  my  hands.  this  helped
for  a  while,  but  when  the  cloth  began  to
stick  to  the  raw  flesh  i  knew  it  was  the
end.

crying my heart out, i called my dogs to
me and showed them my hands. “i can’t do
it,” i said. “i’ve tried, but i just can’t cut it
down. i can’t hold the ax any longer.”

little  ann  whined  and  started  licking
my  sore  hands.  old  dan  seemed  to
understand.  he  showed  his  sympathy  by
nuzzling me with his head.

brokenhearted, i started for home. as i
turned,  from  the  corner  of  my  eye  i  saw
grandpa’s  scarecrow.  it  seemed  to  be
laughing  at  me.  i  looked  over  to  the  big
sycamore.  it  lacked  so  little  being  cut
down. a small wedge of solid wood was
all  that  was  holding  it  up.  i  let  my  eyes
follow  the  smooth  white  trunk  up  to  the
huge spreading limbs.

sobbing,  i  said,  “you  think  you  have
won, but you haven’t. although i can’t get
the  coon,  neither  can  you  live,  because  i
have cut off your breath of life.” and then
i  thought.  “why  kill  the  big  tree  and  not
accomplish anything?” i began to feel bad.
kneeling  down  between  my  dogs,  i
cried  and  prayed.  “please  god,  give  me
the strength to finish the job. i don’t want
to leave the big tree like that. please help

me finish the job.”

i  was  trying  to  rewrap  my  hands  so  i
could go back to work when i heard a low
droning  sound.  i  stood  up  and  looked
around.  i  could  still  hear  the  noise  but
couldn’t locate it. i looked up. high in the
top  of  the  big  sycamore  a  breeze  had
started  the  limbs  to  swaying.  a  shudder
ran through the huge trunk.

another  gust  of  wind  caught  in  the  top
of  the  big  tree.  it  started  popping  and

i looked over to my right at a big black
gum  tree.  not  one  limb  was  moving.  on
its branches a few dead leaves hung silent
and  still.  one  dropped  and  floated  lazily
toward the ground.

large
hackberry. i looked up to its top. it was as
still as a fence post.

left  stood  a

snapping.  i  knew  it  was  going  to  fall.
grabbing  my  dogs  by  their  collars,  i
backed off to safety.

i  held  my  breath.  the  top  of  the  big
sycamore rocked and swayed. there was
a  loud  crack  that  seemed  to  come  from
deep inside the heavy trunk. fascinated, i
stood  and  watched
the
bottoms.  it  seemed  to  be  fighting  so  hard
to keep standing. several times i thought it
would  fall,  but  in  a  miraculous  way  it
would  pull
into  perfect
balance.

the  giant  of

itself  back

the  wind  itself  seemed  to  be  angry  at
the  big
tree’s  stubborn  resistance.  it
growled  and  moaned  as  it  pushed  harder
against  the  wavering  top.  with  one  final
grinding,  creaking  sigh,  the  big  sycamore
started  down.  it  picked  up  momentum  as

the heavy weight of the overbalanced top
dove  for  the  ground.  a  small  ash  was
smothered  by  its  huge  bulk.  there  was  a
lighting-like crack as its trunk snapped.

in its downward plunge, the huge limbs
stripped  the  branches  from  the  smaller
trees. a  log-sized  one  knifed  through  the
top of a water oak. splintered limbs flew
skyward and rained out over the bottoms.
with a cyclone roar, the big tree crashed
to the ground, and then silence settled over
the bottoms.

out of the broken, twisted, tangled mass
streaked  a  brown  furry  ball.  i  turned  my
dogs  loose  and  started  screaming  at  the
top of my voice, “get him, dan, get him.”
in  his  eagerness,  old  dan  ran  head  on
into a bur oak tree. he sat down and with
his deep voice told the river bottoms that

it was little ann who caught the coon. i
heard the ringtail squall when she grabbed
him. scared half to death, i snatched up a
club and ran to help her.

the coon was all over her. he climbed
up  on  her  head,  growling,  slashing,
ripping,  and  tearing.  yelping  with  pain,
she shook him off and he streaked for the
river. i thought surely he was going to get
away. at the very edge of the river’s bank,
she caught him again.

he had been hurt.

i  was  trying  hard  to  get  in  a  lick  with
my  club  but  couldn’t  for  fear  of  hitting
little ann. through the tears in my eyes i
saw  the  red  blurry  form  of  old  dan  sail
into  the  fight.  he  was  a  mad  hound.  his
anger at the bur oak tree was taken out on
the coon.

they  stretched  old  ringy  out  between
them and pinned him to the ground. it was
savage  and  brutal.  i  could  hear  the  dying
squalls of the coon and the deep growls of
old dan. in a short time it was all over.

with  sorrow  in  my  heart,  i  stood  and
watched  while  my  dogs  worried  the
lifeless  body.  little  ann  was  satisfied
first. i had to scold old dan to make him
stop.

carrying  the  coon  by  a  hind  leg,  i
walked  back  to  the  big  tree  for  my  ax.
before  leaving  for  home,  i  stood  and
looked  at  the  fallen  sycamore.  i  should
have  felt  proud  over  the  job  i  had  done,
but  for  some  reason  i  couldn’t.  i  knew  i
would miss the giant of the bottoms, for it
had played a wonderful part in my life. i
thought  of  the  hours  i  had  whiled  away

staring  at  its  beauty  and  how  hard  it  had
been finding the right name for it.

“i’m sorry,” i said. “i didn’t want to cut
you  down,  but  i  had  to.  i  hope  you  can
understand.”

i was a proud boy as i walked along in
the twilight of the evening. i felt so good
even  my  sore  hands  had  stopped  hurting.
what  boy  wouldn’t  have  been  proud?
hadn’t  my  little  hounds  treed  and  killed
their  first  coon?  along  about  then  i
decided i was a full-fledged coon hunter.
nearing  our  house,  i  saw  the  whole
family  had  come  out  on  the  porch.  my
sisters came running, staring wide-eyed at
the dead coon.

got him.”

laughing,  papa  said,  “well,  i  see  you

“i  sure  did,  papa,”  i  said.  i  held  the

coon  up  for  all  to  see.  mama  took  one
look at the lifeless body and winced.

“billy,” she said, “when i heard that big
tree  fall,  it  scared  me  half  to  death.  i
didn’t  know  but  what  it  had  fallen  on
you.”

“aw, mama,” i said, “i was safe. why,
i  backed  way  off  to  one  side.  it  couldn’t
have fallen on me.”

mama  just  shook  her  head.  “i  don’t
know,” she said. “some times i wonder if
all mothers have to go through this.”

“come  on,”  papa  said,  “i’ll  help  you

skin it.”

while we were tacking the hide on the
smokehouse wall, i asked papa if he had
noticed any wind blowing that evening.

he thought a bit and said, “no, i don’t
believe  i  did.  i’ve  been  out  all  day  and

i’m pretty sure i haven’t noticed any wind.
why did you ask?”

“oh, i don’t know, papa,” i said, “but i
thought something strange happened down
in the bottoms this afternoon.”

“i’m  afraid  i  don’t  understand,”  said
papa.  “what  do  you  mean,  ‘something
strange happened?”

i  told  him  about  how  my  hands  had
gotten  so  sore  i  couldn’t  chop  any  more,
and how i had asked for strength to finish
the job.

“well,  what’s  so  strange  about  that?”

he asked.

“i  don’t  know,”  i  said,  “but  i  didn’t
chop the big tree down. the wind blew it
over.”

“why  that’s  nothing,”  papa  said.  “i’ve

seen that happen a lot of times.”

“it wasn’t just the wind,” i said. “it was
the  way  it  blew.  it  didn’t  touch  another
tree  in  the  bottoms.  i  know  because  i
looked around. the big tree was the only
one  touched  by  the  wind.  do  you  think
god  heard  my  prayer?  do  you  think  he
helped me?”

papa

looked  at

the  ground  and
scratched  his  head.  in  a  sober  voice,  he
said,  “i  don’t  know,  billy.  i’m  afraid  i
can’t answer that. you must remember the
big  sycamore  was  the  tallest  tree  in  the
bottoms.  maybe  it  was  up  there  high
enough to catch the wind where the others
couldn’t.  no,  i’m  afraid  i  can’t  help  you
there. you’ll have to decide for yourself.”
it wasn’t hard for me to decide. i was

firmly convinced that i had been helped.

x

mama made me a cap out of my first coon hide.
i  was  as  proud  of  it  as  papa  would’ve
been  if  someone  had  given  him  a  dozen
missouri  mules.  mama  said  afterwards
that she wished she hadn’t made it for me
because,  in  some  way,  wearing  that  cap
must’ve  affected  my  mind.  i  went  coon
crazy.

i was out after the ringtails every night.
about  the  only  time  i  didn’t  go  hunting
was when the weather was bad, and even
then mama all but had to hog-tie me.

what  wonderful  nights

they  were,
running  like  a  deer  through  the  thick
timber  of  the  bottoms,  tearing  my  way

and

jumping

through stands of wild cane, climbing over
drifts,
running,
screaming,  and  yelling,  “who-e-e-e,  get
him,  boy,  get  him,”  following  the  voices
of my little hounds.

logs,

it wasn’t too hard for a smart old coon
to fool old dan, but there were none that
prowled the riverbanks that could fool my
little ann.

as grandpa had predicted, the price of
coonskins  jumped  sky-high.  a  good-size
hide  was  worth  from  four  to  ten  dollars,
depending on the grade and quality.

i  kept  the  side  of  our  smokehouse
plastered  with  hides.  of  course  i  would
spread  them  out  a  little  to  cover  more
space. i always stretched them on the side
facing the road, never on the back side. i
wanted  everyone  in  the  country  to  see

the  money  earned  from  my  furs  was
turned  over  to  my  father.  i  didn’t  care
about it. i had what i wanted—my dogs. i
supposed  that  papa  was  saving  it  for
something  because  i  never  saw  anything
new turn up around our home, but, like any
young  boy,  i  wasn’t  bothered  by  it  and  i
asked no questions.

my  whole  life  was  wrapped  up  in  my
dogs. everywhere i went they went along.
there  was  only  one  place  i  didn’t  want
them  to  go  with  me  and  that  was  to
grandpa’s store. other dogs were always
there, and it seemed as if they all wanted
to jump on old dan.

them.

it  got  so  about  the  only  time  i  went  to
see  my  grandfather  was  when  i  had  a
bundle of fur to take to the store. this was

always a problem. in every way i could, i
would  try  to  slip  away  from  my  dogs.
sometimes  i  swore  that  they  could  read
my  mind.  it  made  no  difference  what  i
tried; i couldn’t fool them.

taking my furs, i sneaked out through a
back  door  and,  walking  like  a  tomcat,  i
made  it  to  the  timber.  i  climbed  a  small
dogwood  tree  and  looked  back.  they

one  time  i  was  sure  i  had  outsmarted
them. the day before i was to make one of
my trips i took my furs out to the barn and
hid them. the next morning i hung around
the  house
then
nonchalantly  whistled  my  way  out  to  the
barn. i climbed up in the loft and peeked
through a crack. i could see them lying in
front of their doghouse. they weren’t even
looking my way.

for  a  while,  and

were  still  there  and  didn’t  seem  to  know
what i’d done.

feeling just about as smart as sherlock
holmes,  i  headed  for  the  store.  i  was
walking along singing my lungs out when
they  came  tearing  out  of  the  underbrush,
wiggling and twisting, and tickled to death
to be with me. at first i was mad but one
look  at  dancing  little  ann  and  all  was
forgiven. i sat down on my bundle of fur
and  laughed  till  i  hurt  all  over.  i  could
scold  them  a  little  but  i  could  no  more
have  whipped  one  of  them  than  i  could
have  kissed  a  girl.  after  all  a  boy  just
doesn’t whip his dogs.

grandpa  always  counted  my

furs
carefully  and  marked  something  down  on
a  piece  of  paper.  i’d  never  seen  him  do
this with other hunters and it got the best

of  my  curiosity.  one  day  while  he  was
writing i asked him, “why do you do that,
grandpa?”  he  looked  at  me  over  his
glasses  and  said  kind  of  sharp,  “never
mind. i have my reasons.”

i  didn’t  have  to  tell  any  whoppers  for
some  of  the  things  my  dogs  did  were

when  grandpa  talked  to  me  like  that  i
didn’t push things any farther. besides, it
didn’t  make  any  difference  to  me  if  he
marked  on  every  piece  of  paper  in  the
store.

i always managed to make my trips on
saturdays  as  that  was  “coon  hunters’  ”
day.  i  didn’t  have  to  stand  around  on  the
outside of the circle any more and listen to
the  coon  hunters.  i’d  get  right  up  in  the
middle and say my piece with the rest of
them.

almost unbelievable anyhow. oh, i guess i
did  make  things  a  little  bigger  than  they
actually were but i never did figure a coon
hunter  told  honest-to-goodness  lies.  he
just kind of stretched things a little.

the coon hunters were always kidding
me about my dogs. some of the remarks i
heard made me fighting mad. “i never saw

i  could  hold

those  coon  hunters
spellbound with some of my hunting tales.
grandpa would never say anything while i
was  telling  my  stories.  he  just  puttered
around the store with a silly little grin on
his  face.  once  in  a  while  when  i  got  too
far  off  the  beaten  path,  he  would  come
around  and  cram  a  bar  of  soap  in  my
pocket. my face would get all red, i’d cut
my story short, fly out the door, and head
for home.

hounds  so  small,  but  i  guess  they  are
hounds, at least they look like it.” “i don’t
believe  little ann  is  half  as  smart  as  he
says she is. she’s so little those old coons
think she’s a rabbit. i bet she sneaks right
up  on  them  before  they  realize  she’s  a
dog.” “some of these nights a big old coon
is  going  to  carry  her  off  to  his  den  and
raise some little coon puppies.”

i always took their kidding with a smile
on my face, but it made my blood boil like
the  water  in  mama’s  teakettle.  i  had  one
way  of  shutting  them  up.  “let’s  all  go  in
the store,” i’d say, “and see who has the
most hides in there.”

it  was  true  that  my  dogs  were  small,
especially  little  ann.  she  could  walk
under an ordinary hound; in fact, she was
a regular midget. if it had not been for her

long ears, no one could have told that she
was a hound. her actions weren’t those of
a  hunting  hound.  she  was  constantly
playing. she would play with our chickens
and young calves, with a piece of paper or
a  corncob.  what  my  little  girl  lacked  in
size, she made up in sweetness. she could
make friends with a tomcat.

old  dan  was  just  the  opposite.  he
strutted  around  with  a  belligerent  and
tough  attitude.  although  he  wasn’t  a  tall
dog, he was heavy. his body was long and
his  chest  broad  and  thick.  his  legs  were
short,  big,  and  solid.  the  muscles  in  his
body  were  hard  and  knotty.  when  he
walked,  they  would  twist  and  jerk  under
the skin.

he was a friendly dog. there were no
strangers to him. he loved everyone. yet

he was a strange dog. he would not hunt
with another hound, other than little ann,
or another hunter, not even my father. the
strangest thing about old dan was that he
would  not  hunt,  even  with  me,  unless
little ann was with him. i found this out
the first night i tried it.

little ann  had  cut  the  pad  of  her  right
foot on a sharp jagged flint rock. it was a
nasty  cut.  i  made  a  little  boot  of  leather
and  put  it  on  her  wounded  foot.  to  keep
her from following me, i locked her in the
corncrib.

two nights later i decided to take old
dan hunting for a while. he followed me
down
and
disappeared  in  the  thick  timber.  i  waited
and  waited  for  him  to  strike  a  trail.
nothing happened. after about two hours,

understood. i walked over and opened the
door.  he  jumped  up  in  the  crib,  smelled
little  ann’s  foot,  twisted  around  in  the
shucks,  and  lay  down  by  her  side. as  he
looked  at  me,  i  read  this  message  in  his
friendly  gray  eyes,  “you  could’ve  done
this a long time ago.”

little  ann  was  my  sisters’  pet.  they

i  never  did  know  if  little  ann  would
hunt by herself or not. i am sure she would
have,
smart  and
understanding dog, but i never tried to find
out.

she  was  a

would take her down to the creek and give
her baths. she loved it all.

if  mama  wanted  a  chicken  caught,  she
would call little ann. she would run the
chicken  down  and  hold  it  with  her  paws
until mama came. not one feather would
be  harmed.  mama  tried  old  dan  once.
before  she  got  the  chicken,  there  wasn’t
much left but the feathers.

the

by  some  strange  twist  of  nature,  little
ann  was  destined  to  go  through  life
without  being  a  mother.  perhaps  it  was
because  she  was  stunted  in  growth,  or
maybe because she was the runt in a large
litter. that may have had something to do
with it.

during

fur  season,  november
through  february,  i  was  given  complete

freedom  from  work.  many  times  when  i
came  home,  the  sun  was  high  in  the  sky.
after each hunt, i always took care of my
dogs. the flint rocks and saw briers were
hard  on  their  feet.  with  a  bottle  of
peroxide  and  a  can  of  salve  i  would
doctor their wounds.

i  never  knew  what  to  expect  from  old
dan.  i  never  saw  a  coon  hound  so
determined  or  one  that  could  get  into  so
many predicaments. more than one time, it
would  have  been  the  death  of  him  if  it
hadn’t been for smart little ann.

one  night,  not  long  after  i  had  entered
the bottoms, my dogs struck the trail of an
old boar coon. he was a smart old fellow
and had a sackful of tricks. he crossed the
river time after time. finally, swimming to
the middle and staying in the swift current,

he swam downstream.

knowing  he  would  have  to  come  out
somewhere,  my  dogs  split  up.  old  dan
took the right side. little ann worked the
other side. i came out of the bottoms onto
a gravel bar and stood and watched them
in the moonlight.

little ann worked downriver, and then
she came up. i saw her when she passed
me  going  up
the  bank,  sniffing  and
searching  for  the  trail.  she  came  back  to
me. i patted her head, scratched her ears,
and talked to her. she kept staring across
the river to where old dan was searching
for the trail.

she waded in and swam across to help
him. i knew that the coon had not come out
of  the  river  on  her  side.  if  he  had,  she
would have found the trail. i walked up to

a  riffle,  pulled  off  my  shoes,  and  waded
across.

my dogs worked the riverbank, up and
down.  they  circled  far  out  into  the
bottoms. i could hear the loud snuffing of
old dan. he was bewildered and mad. i
was  getting  a  thrill  from  it  all,  as  i  had
never seen them fooled like this.

there  was  a  loud  splash.  i  saw  old

old dan gave up on his side, piled into
the  river,  and  swam  across  to  the  side
little ann had worked. i knew that it was
useless for him to do that.

i was on the point of giving up, calling
them to me, and going elsewhere to hunt,
when  i  heard  the  bawl  of  little  ann.  i
couldn’t believe what i heard. she wasn’t
bawling on a trail. she was sounding the
tree bark. i hurried down the bank.

dan  swimming  back.  by  this  time,  little
ann  was  really  singing  a  song.  in  the
bright  moonlight,  i  could  see  old  dan
clearly.  his  powerful  front  legs  were
churning the water.

then i saw a sight that makes a hunter’s
heart  swell  with  pride.  still  swimming,
old  dan  raised  his  head  high  out  of  the
water and bawled. he couldn’t wait until
he  reached  the  bank  to  tell  little ann  he
was coming. from far out in the river he
told her.

reaching  the  shallows,  he  plowed  out
of  the  river  onto  a  sand  bar.  not  even
taking  time  to  shake  the  water  from  his
body,  again  he  raised  his  head  and
bawled, and tore out down the bank.

in  a  trot,  i  followed,  whooping  to  let
them  know  i  was  coming.  before  i

reached  the  tree,  old  dan’s  deep  voice
was making the timber shake.

the  tree  was  a  large  birch,  standing
right  on  the  bank  of  the  river.  the  swift
current  had  eaten  away  at  the  footing,
causing it to lean. the lower branches of
the tree dangled in the water.

i  saw  how  the  smart  old  coon  had
pulled  his  trick.  coming  in  toward  the
bank  from  midstream,  he  had  caught  the
dangling limbs and climbed up. exhausted
from the long swim, he stayed there in the
birch thinking he had outsmarted my dogs.
i couldn’t understand how little ann had
found him.

it was impossible to fall the tree toward
the bottoms. it was too much off balance. i
did the next best thing. i cut a long elder
switch. unbuckling one of my suspenders,

i tied it to the end and climbed the tree.

the coon was sitting in a fork of a limb.
taking my switch, i whopped him a good
one  and  out  he  came.  he  sailed  out  over
the  river.  with  a  loud  splash,  he  hit  the
water  and  swam  for  the  other  side.  my
dogs jumped off the bank after him. they
were  no  match  against  his  expert
swimming. on reaching the other bank, he
ran downriver.

climbing down out of the tree, i picked
up my ax and lantern, and trotted down to
another  riffle  and  waded  across.  i  could
tell by the bawling of my dogs, they were
close to the coon. he would have to climb
a tree, or be caught on the ground.

all at once their voices stopped. i stood
still  and  waited  for  them  to  bawl  treed.
nothing happened. thinking the coon had

taken  to  the  river  again,  i  waited  to  give
them  time  to  reach  the  opposite  bank.  i
waited  and  waited.  i  could  hear  nothing.
by then i knew he had not crossed over. i
thought perhaps they had caught him on the
ground. i hurried on.

i  came  to  a  point  where  a  slough  of
crystal-clear  water  ran  into  the  river.  on
the other side was a bluff. i could hear one
of my dogs over there. as i watched and
waited, i heard a dog jump in the water. it
was  little  ann.  she  swam  across  and
came up to me. staying with me for just a
second,  she  jumped  in  the  slough  and
swam back to the other side.

i could hear her sniffing and whining. i
couldn’t  figure  out  where  old  dan  was.
by squatting down and holding the lantern
high over my head, i could dimly see the

opposite bank. little ann was running up
and down. i noticed she always stayed in
one  place  of  about  twenty-five  yards,
never leaving that small area.

she  ran  down  to  the  water’s  edge  and
stared  out  into  the  slough.  the  horrible
thought came that old dan had drowned. i
knew a big coon was capable of drowning
a  dog  in  water  by  climbing  on  his  head
and forcing him under.

as  fast  as  i  could  run,  i  circled  the
slough,  climbed  up  over  the  bluff,  and
came down to where little ann was. she
was  hysterical,  running  up  and  down  the
bank and whining.

i tied my lantern on a long pole, held it
out  over  the  water,  and  looked  for  old
dan’s  body.  i  could  see  clearly  in  the
clear spring waters, but i couldn’t see my

dog  anywhere.  i  sat  down  on  the  bank,
buried  my  face  in  my  hands,  and  cried.  i
was sure he was gone.

several  minutes  passed,  and  all  that
time  little  ann  had  never  stopped.
running here and there along the bank, she
kept sniffing and whining.

i  heard  when  she  started  digging.  i
looked around. she was ten feet from the
water’s  edge.  i  got  up  and  went  over  to
her. she was digging in a small hole about
the size of a big apple. it was the air hole
for a muskrat den.

i pulled little ann away from the hole,
knelt  down,  and  put  my  ear  to  it.  i  could
hear something, and feel a vibration in the
ground. it was an eerie sound and seemed
to  be  coming  from  far  away.  i  listened.
finally i understood what the noise was.

it was the voice of old dan. little ann
had  opened  the  hole  up  enough  with  her
digging  so  his  voice  could  be  heard
faintly. in some way he had gotten into that
old muskrat den.

i knew that down under the bank, in the
water,  the  entrance  to  the  den  could  be
found. rolling up my sleeve, i tried to find
it with my hand. i had no luck. it was too
far down.

there was only one thing to do. leaving
my ax and lantern, i ran for home. picking
up a long-handled shovel, i hurried back.
the sun was high in the sky before i had
dug  old  dan  out.  he  was  a  sight  to  see,
nothing but mud from the tip of his nose to
the end of his tail. i held on to his collar
and led him down to the river to wash him
off.  the  water  there  was  much  warmer

than the cold spring water of the slough.

after washing him, i turned him loose.
right  back  to  the  hole  he  ran.  little ann
was already digging. i knew the coon was
still there. working together, we dug him
out.

after  the  coon  was  killed,  i  saw  what
had  made  him  so  smart.  his  right  front
foot  was  twisted  and  shriveled.  at  one
time  he  must  have  been  caught  in  a  trap
and  had  pulled  himself  free.  he  was  an
old coon. his face was almost white. he
was big and heavy and had beautiful fur.

tired, muddy, wet, and hungry, i started

for home.

i’ve  often  wondered  how  old  dan  got
into  that  old  muskrat  den.  perhaps  there
was  another  entrance  i  had  overlooked.
i’ll never know.

one night, far back in the mountains, in
a  place  called  “the  cyclone  timber,”
old dan really pulled a good one.

many  years  before  my  time,  a  terrible
cyclone  had  ripped  its  way  through  the
mountains, leaving its scar in the form of
fallen  timber,  twisted  and  snarled.  the
path  of  the  cyclone  was  several  miles
wide  and  several  miles  long.  it  was
wonderful  place  to  hunt  as  it  abounded
with game.

my dogs had struck the trail of a coon
about  an  hour  before.  they  had  really
been warming him up. i knew it was about
time  for  him  to  take  up  a  tree,  and  sure
enough, i heard the deep voice of old dan
telling the world he had a coon up a tree.

i  was  trotting  along,  going  to  them,
when  his  voice  stopped.  i  could  hear

little ann,  but  not  old  dan.  i  wondered
why,  and  was  a  little  scared,  for  i  just
knew  something  had  happened.  then  i
heard  his  voice.  it  seemed  louder  than  it
had been before. i felt much better.

when  i  came  up  to  the  tree  i  thought
little  ann  had  treed  old  dan.  she  was
sitting  on  her  haunches  staring  up  and
bawling  the  tree  bark.  there,  a  good
fifteen feet from the ground, with his hind
legs  planted  firmly  in  the  center  of  a  big
limb, and his front feet against the trunk of
the tree, stood old dan, bawling for all he
was worth.

above him some eight or nine feet was
a  baby  coon.  i  was  glad  it  was  a  young
one,  for  if  it  had  been  an  old  one,  he
would  have  jumped  out.  old  dan  would
have followed, and he surely would have

broken all of his legs.

from where i was standing, i could see
it  was  impossible  for  old  dan  to  have
climbed the tree. it was dead and more of
an  old  snag  than  a  tree,  with  limbs  that
were  crooked  and  twisted.  the  bark  had
rotted  away  and  fallen  off,  leaving  the
trunk  bare  and  slick  as  glass.  it  was  a
good  ten  feet  up  to  the  first  limb.  i
couldn’t  figure  out  how  old  dan  had
climbed  that  tree.  there  had  to  be  a
solution somewhere.

walking around to the other side, i saw
how he had accomplished his feat. there
in  the  bottom  was  a  large  hole.  the  old
tree was hollow. stepping back, i looked
up and could see another hole, which had
been  hidden  from  me  because  of  old
dan’s body.

he had simply crawled into the hole at
the  bottom,  climbed  up  the  hollow  of  the
tree, and worked his way out on the limb.
in  some  way  he  had  turned  around  and
reared up, placing his front feet against the
trunk.

there he was. i didn’t know what to do.
i  couldn’t  cut  the  tree  down  and  i  was
afraid  to  climb  it  for  fear  i  would  scare
the  coon  into  jumping  out.  if  he  did,  old
dan would jump, too, and break his legs.
i ran plan after plan around in my mind.
none  would  work.  i  finally  came  to  the
conclusion that i had to climb the tree and
get ahold of that crazy dog. i blew out my
lantern,  pulled  off  my  shoes  and  socks,
and started shinnying up the tree. i prayed
that the coon wouldn’t jump out.

inching along, being as quiet as i could,

i made it up to old dan and grabbed his
collar.  i  sat  down  on  the  limb,  and  held
him  tight.  he  would  bawl  now  and  then,
and all but burst my eardrums. i couldn’t
drop  him  to  the  ground,  and  i  couldn’t
climb down with him. i couldn’t sit there
on  that  limb  and  hold  him  all  night.  i
would  be  no  better  off  when  daylight
came.

glancing  at  the  hole  by  my  side  gave
me the solution to my problem. i thought,
“if  he  came  out  of  this  hole,  he  can  go
back in it.”

that  was  the  way  i  got  my  dog  down
from the tree. this had its problems, too.
in the first place, old dan didn’t want to
be put in the hole head first. by scolding,
pushing,  shoving,  and  squeezing,  i  finally
got him started on his way.

like  a  fool,  i  sat  there  on  the  limb,
waiting to see him come out at the bottom,
and  come  out  he  did.  turning  around,
bawling  as  he  did,  right  back  in  the  hole
he went. there was nothing i could do but
sit  and  wait.  i  understood  why  his  voice
had stopped for a while. he just took time
out to climb a tree.

putting my ear to the hole, i could hear
him coming. grunting and clawing, up he
came. i helped him out of the hole, turned
him  around,  and  crammed  him  back  in.
that  time  i  wasn’t  too  gentle  with  my
work.  i  was  tired  of  sitting  on  the  limb,
and my bare feet were getting cold.

i started down the same time he did. he
beat me down. looking over my shoulder,
i saw him turn around and head back for
the hole. i wasn’t far from the ground so i

let go. the flint rocks didn’t feel too good
to my feet when i landed.

i jumped to the hole just in time to see
the tip end of his long tail disappearing. i
grabbed  it.  holding  on  with  one  hand,  i
worked his legs down with my other, and
pulled him out. i stopped his tree-climbing
by  cramming  rocks  and  chunks  into  the
hole.

how  the  coon  stayed  in  the  tree,  i’ll
never know, but stay he did. with a well-
aimed  rock,  i  scared  him  out.  old  dan
satisfied his lust to kill.

i  started  for  home.  i’d  had  all  the

hunting i wanted for that night.

xi

i had often wondered what old dan would do
if  little  ann  got  into  some  kind  of  a
predicament. one night i got my answer.

for  several  days  a  northern  blizzard
had been blowing. it was a bad one. the
temperature  dropped  down  to  ten  below.
the storm started with a slow cold drizzle
and  then  sleet.  when  the  wind  started
blowing,  everything  froze,  leaving  the
ground as slick as glass.

trapped indoors, i was as nervous as a
fish out of water. i told mama i guessed it
was just going to storm all winter.

she  laughed  and  said,  “i  don’t  think  it
will, but it does look like it will last for a

while.”

she  ruffled  up  my  hair  and  kissed  me
between  the  eyes.  this  did  rile  me  up.  i
didn’t like to be kissed like that. it seemed
that i could practically rub my skin off and
still feel it, all wet and sticky, and kind of
burning.

sometime  on  the  fifth  night,  the  storm
blew itself out and it snowed about three
inches. the next morning i went out to my
doghouse.  scraping  the  snow  away  from
the  two-way  door,  i  stuck  my  head  in.  it
was  as  warm  as  an  oven.  i  got  my  face
washed all over by little ann. old dan’s
tail thumped out a tune on the wall.

i  told  them  to  be  ready  because  we
were  going  hunting  that  night.  i  knew  the
old ringtails would be hungry and stirring
for  they  had  been  denned  up  during  the

that  evening  as  i  was  leaving  the
house,  papa  said,  “billy,  be  careful
tonight.  it’s  slick  down  under  the  snow,
and it would be easy to twist an ankle or
break a leg.”

i  told  him  i  would  and  that  i  wasn’t
going far, just down back of our fields in
the bottoms.

storm.

“well,  anyway,”  he  said,  “be  careful.
there’ll  be  no  moon  tonight  and  you’re
going to see some fog next to the river.”

walking  through  our  fields  i  saw  my
father  was  right  about  it  being  slick  and
dark.  several  times  i  slipped  and  sat
down. i couldn’t see anything beyond the
glow of my lantern, but i wasn’t worried.
my light was a good one, and mama had
insisted  that  i  make  two  little  leather

pouches to cover the blades of my ax.

the

rolled  around  under

just  before  i  reached  the  timber,  old
dan  shook  the  snow  from  the  underbrush
with  his  deep  voice.  i  stopped  and
listened. he bawled again. the deep bass
tones
tall
sycamores, tore their way out of the thick
timber,  traveled  out  over  the  fields,  and
slammed  up  against  the  foothills.  there
they seemed to break up and die away in
the mountains.

old  dan  was  working  the  trail  slowly
and i knew why. he would never line out
until little ann was running by his side. i
thought  she  would  never  get  there.  when
she  did,  her  beautiful  voice  made  the
blood  pound  in  my  temples.  i  felt  the
excitement of the hunt as it ate its way into
my  body.  taking  a  deep  breath,  i  reared

the  coon  ran  upriver  for  a  way  and
then, cutting out of the bottoms, he headed
for  the  mountains.  i  stood  and  listened
until  their  voices  went  out  of  hearing.
slipping  and  sliding,  i  started  in  the
direction  i  had  last  heard  them.  about
halfway  to  the  foothills  i  heard  them
coming back.

somewhere in the rugged mountains, the
coon  had  turned  and  headed  toward  the
river. it was about time for him to play out
a few tricks and i was wondering what he
would do. i knew it would be hard for him
to hide his trail with snow on the ground,
and i realized later that the smart old coon
knew this, too.

back and whooped as loud as i could.

as the voices of my dogs grew louder, i
could  tell  that  they  were  coming  straight

toward me. once i started to blow out my
lantern,  thinking  that  maybe  i  could  see
them  when  they  crossed  our  field,  but  i
realized i didn’t stand a chance of seeing
the race in the skunk-black night.

down out of the mountains they brought
him,  singing  a  hound-dog  song  on  his
heels. the coon must have scented me, or
seen my lantern. he cut to my right and ran
between  our  house  and  me.  i  heard
screaming and yelling from my sisters. my
father started whooping.

i knew my whole family was out on the
porch  listening  to  the  beautiful  voices  of
my  little  red  hounds.  i  felt  as  tall  as  the
tallest sycamore on the riverbank. i yelled
as  loud  as  i  could.  again  i  heard  the
squealing  of  my  sisters  and  the  shouts  of
my father.

the deep “ou-ou-ou’s” of old dan and
the sharp “aw-aw-aw-aw’s” of little ann
bored  a  hole  in  the  inky-black  night.  the
vibrations  rolled  and  quivered  in  the  icy
silence.

the  coon  was  heading  for  the  river.  i
could  tell  my  dogs  were  crowding  him,
and wondered if he’d make it to the water.
i  was  hoping  he  wouldn’t,  for  i  didn’t
want to wade the cold water unless i had
to do it.

i

i  figured  the  smart  old  coon  had  a
reason for turning and coming back to the
river  and  wondered  what  trick  he  had  in
mind.
something  my
grandfather had told me. he said, “never
underestimate the cunning of an old river
coon.  when  the  nights  are  dark  and  the
ground  is  frozen  and  slick,  they  can  pull

remembered

some mean tricks on a hound. sometimes
the tricks can be fatal.”

i  was  halfway  through  the  fog-covered
bottoms  when  the  voices  of  my  dogs
stopped. i stood still, waited, and listened.
a cold silence settled over the bottoms. i
could  hear  the  snap  and  crack  of  sap-
frozen  limbs.  from  far  back  in  the  flinty
hills, the long, lonesome howl of a timber
wolf  floated  down  in  the  silent  night.
across  the  river  i  heard  a  cow  moo.  i
knew  the  sound  was  coming  from  the
lowery place.

not being able to hear the voices of my
dogs gave me an uncomfortable feeling. i
whooped  and  waited  for  one  of  them  to
bawl.  as  i  stood  waiting  i  realized
something  was  different  in  the  bottoms.
something was missing.

i  wasn’t  worried  about  my  dogs.  i
figured that the coon had pulled some trick
and sooner or later they would unravel the
trail.  but  the  feeling  that  something  was
just not right had me worried.

i whooped several times but still could
get  no  answer.  stumbling,  slipping,  and
sliding, i started on. reaching the river, i
saw it was frozen over. i realized what my
strange uneasy feeling was. i had not been
able to hear the sound of the water.

as  i  stood  listening  i  heard  a  gurgling
out in the middle of the stream. the river
wasn’t frozen all the way across. the still
eddy waters next to the banks had frozen,
but  out  in  the  middle,  where  the  current
was swift, the water was running, leaving
a  trough  in  the  ice  pack.  the  gurgling
sound i had heard was the swift current as

it sucked its way through the channel.

the last time i had heard my dogs they
were  downstream  from  me.  i  walked  on,
listening.

i hadn’t gone far when i heard old dan.
what i heard froze the blood in my veins.
he wasn’t bawling on a trail or giving the
tree bark. it was one, long, continuous cry.
in  his  deep  voice  there  seemed  to  be  a
pleading  cry  for  help.  scared,  worried,
and  with  my  heart  beating  like  a  churn
dasher, i started toward the sound.

i  almost  passed  him  but  with  another
cry he let me know where he was. he was
out on the ice pack. i couldn’t see him for
the  fog.  i  called  to  him  and  he  answered
with  a  low  whine.  again  i  called  his
name. this time he came to me.

he  wasn’t  the  same  dog.  his  tail  was

between his legs and his head was bowed
down.  he  stopped  about  seven  feet  from
me. sitting down on the ice, he raised his
head and howled the most mournful cry i
had ever heard. turning around, he trotted
back out on the ice and disappeared in the
fog.

i  knew  something  had  happened  to
little  ann.  i  called  her  name.  she
answered with a pleading cry. although i
couldn’t  see  her,  i  guessed  what  had
happened.  the  coon  had  led  them  to  the
river.  running  out  on  the  ice,  he  had
leaped across the trough. my dogs, hot on
the  trail,  had  followed.  old  dan,  a  more
powerful  dog  than  little  ann,  had  made
his leap. little ann had not made it. her
small  feet  had  probably  slipped  on  the
slick  ice  and  she  had  fallen  into  the  icy

waters.  old  dan,  seeing  the  fate  of  his
little friend, had quit the chase and come
back to help her. the smart old coon had
pulled his trick, and a deadly one it was.

i had to do something. she would never
be able to get out by herself. it was only a
matter  of  time  until  her  body  would  be
paralyzed by the freezing water.

laying  my  ax  down,  i  held  my  lantern
out in front of me and stepped out on the
ice.  it  started  cracking  and  popping.  i
jumped back to the bank. although it was
thick enough to hold the light weight of my
dogs, it would never hold me.

little ann started whining and begging
for  help.  i  went  all  to  pieces  and  started
crying.  something  had  to  be  done  and
done  quickly  or  my  little  dog  was  lost.  i
thought of running home for a rope or for

my  father,  but  i  knew  she  couldn’t  last
until  i  got  back.  i  was  desperate.  it  was
impossible for me to swim in the freezing
water.  i  wouldn’t  last  for  a  minute.  she
cried  again,  begging  for  the  one  thing  i
couldn’t give her, help.

i thought, “if only i could see her maybe
i could figure out some way i could help.”
looking at my lantern gave me an idea.
i ran up the bank about thirty feet, turned,
and looked back. i could see the light, not
well, but enough for what i had in mind. i
grabbed my lantern and ax and ran for the
bottoms.

i was looking for a stand of wild cane.
after  what  seemed  like  ages,  i  found  it.
with the longest one i could find, i hurried
back. after it was trimmed and the limber
end cut off, i hung the lantern by the handle

on the end of it and started easing it out on
the ice.

i  saw  old  dan  first.  he  was  sitting
close  to  the  edge  of  the  trough,  looking
down.  then  i  saw  her.  i  groaned  at  her
plight. all  i  could  see  was  her  head  and
her  small  front  paws.  her  claws  were
spread  out  and  digging  into  the  ice.  she
knew  if  she  ever  lost  that  hold  she  was
gone.

old  dan  raised  his  head  and  howled.
hound though he was, he knew it was the
end of the trail for his little pal.

i  wanted  to  get  my  light  as  close  to
little ann as i could, but my pole was a
good  eight  feet  short.  setting  the  lantern
down,  i  eased  the  pole  from  under  the
handle, i thought, “i’m no better off than i
was before. in fact i’m worse off. now i

little ann cried again. i saw her claws
slip on the ice. her body settled lower in
the  water.  old  dan  howled  and  started
fidgeting. he knew the end was close.

i didn’t exactly know when i started out
toward my dog. i had taken only two steps
when the ice broke. i twisted my body and
fell  toward  the  bank.  just  as  my  hand
closed on a root i thought my feet touched
bottom,  but  i  wasn’t  sure.  as  i  pulled
myself  out  i  felt  the  numbing  cold  creep
over my legs.

it  looked  so  hopeless.  there  didn’t

can see when the end comes.”

seem to be any way i could save her.

at  the  edge  of  the  water  stood  a  large
sycamore. i got behind it, anything to blot
out  that  heartbreaking  scene.  little  ann,
thinking i had deserted her, started crying.

i couldn’t stand it.

i  opened  my  mouth  to  call  old  dan.  i
wanted to tell him to come on and we’d go
home  as  there  was  nothing  we  could  do.
the  words  just  wouldn’t  come  out.  i
couldn’t  utter  a  sound.  i  lay  my  face
against the icy cold bark of the sycamore.
i  thought  of  the  prayer  i  had  said  when  i
had asked god to help me get two hound
pups.  i  knelt  down  and  sobbed  out  a
prayer. i asked for a miracle which would
save the life of my little dog. i promised
all  the  things  that  a  young  boy  could  if
only he would help me.

still  saying  my  prayer  and  making
promises, i heard a sharp metallic sound. i
jumped  up  and  stepped  away  from  the
tree.  i  was  sure  the  noise  i  heard  was
made by a rattling chain on the front end of

i  shouted  as  loud  as  i  could.  “over

here. i need help. my dog is drowning.”

i waited for an answer. all i could hear

a boat.

were the cries of little ann.

again i hollered. “over here. over on
the  bank.  can  you  see  my  light?  i  need
help. please hurry.”

i  held  my  breath  waiting  for  an
answering  shout.  i  shivered  from  the
freezing  cold  of  my  wet  shoes  and
overalls. a  straining  silence  settled  over
the river. a feathery rustle swished by in
the blackness. a flock of low-flying ducks
had  been  disturbed  by  my  loud  shouts.  i
strained my ears for some sound. now and
then  i  could  hear  the  lapping  slap  of  the
ice-cold  water  as  it  swirled  its  way
through the trough.

i  glanced  to  little  ann.  she  was  still
holding  on  but  i  saw  her  paws  were
almost  at  the  edge.  i  knew  her  time  was
short.

i  couldn’t  figure  out  what  i  had  heard.
the  sound  was  made  by  metal  striking
metal, but what was it? what could have
caused it?

i looked at my ax. it couldn’t have made
the sound as it was too close to me. the
noise had come from out in the river.

when i looked at my lantern i knew that
it  had  made  the  strange  sound.  i  had  left
the handle standing straight up when i had
taken  the  pole  away.  now  it  was  down.
for  some  unknown  reason  the  stiff  wire
handle  had  twisted  in  the  sockets  and
dropped. as it had fallen it had struck the
metal  frame,  making  the  sharp  metallic

sound i had heard.

as  i  stared  at  the  yellow  glow  of  my
light,  the  last  bit  of  hope  faded  away.  i
closed  my  eyes,  intending  to  pray  again
for the help i so desperately needed. then
like a blinding red flash the message of the
lantern bored its way into my brain. there
was  my  miracle.  there  was  the  way  to
save my little dog. in the metallic sound i
had  heard  were  my  instructions.  they
were  so  plain
i  couldn’t  help  but
understand them. the bright yellow flame
started  flickering  and  dancing.  it  seemed
to  be  saying,  “hurry. you  know  what  to
do.”

faster than i had ever moved in my life
i  went  to  work.  with  a  stick  i  measured
the  water  in  the  hole  where  my  feet  had
broken  through  the  ice.  i  was  right.  my

foot  had  touched  bottom.  eighteen  inches
down i felt the soft mud.

took

with my pole i fished the lantern back
the  bank.  i
the  handle  off,

straightened it out, and bent a hook in one
end.  with  one  of  my  shoelaces  i  tied  the
wire to the end of the cane pole. i left the
hook sticking out about six inches beyond
the end of it.

i  started  shouting  encouragement  to
little ann. i told her to hang on and not to
give  up  for  i  was  going  to  save  her.  she
answered with a low cry.

with  the  hook  stuck  in  one  of  the
ventilating  holes  in  the  top  of  my  light,  i
lifted  it  back  out  on  the  ice  and  set  it
down. after a little wiggling and pushing,
i worked the hook loose and laid the pole
down.

i took off my clothes, picked up my ax,
and stepped down into the hole in the icy
water. it came to my knees. step by step,
breaking the ice with my ax, i waded out.
the water came up to my hips, and then
to  my  waist.  the  cold  bite  of  it  took  my
breath away. i felt my body grow numb. i
couldn’t feel my feet at all but i knew they
were moving. when the water reached my
armpits  i  stopped  and  worked  my  pole
toward little ann. stretching my arms as
far out as i could, i saw i was still a foot
short.  closing  my  eyes  and  gritting  my
teeth, i moved on. the water reached my
chin.

i was close enough. i started hooking at
the collar of little ann. time after time i
felt  the  hook  almost  catch.  i  saw  i  was
fishing on a wrong angle. she had settled

so  low  in  the  water  i  couldn’t  reach  her
collar. raising my arms above my head so
the  pole  would  be  on  a  slant  i  kept
hooking  and  praying.  the  seconds  ticked
by.  i  strained  for  one  more  inch.  the
muscles  in  my  arms  grew  numb  from  the
weight of the pole.

little  ann’s  claws  slipped  again.  i
thought she was gone. at the very edge of
the ice, she caught again. all i could see
now  were  her  small  red  paws  and  her
nose and eyes.

by  old  dan’s  actions  i  could  tell  he
understood  and  wanted  to  help.  he  ran
over close to my pole and started digging
at  the  ice.  i  whopped  him  with  the  cane.
that was the only time in my life i ever hit
my dog. i had to get him out of the way so
i could see what i was doing.

just  when  i

task  was
impossible, i felt the hook slide under the
tough leather. it was none too soon.

thought  my

as gently as i could i dragged her over
the  rim  of  the  ice.  at  first  i  thought  she
was  dead.  she  didn’t  move.  old  dan
started  whining  and  licking  her  face  and
ears. she moved her head. i started talking
to  her.  she  made  an  effort  to  stand  but
couldn’t. her muscles were paralyzed and
the blood had long since ceased to flow.

at the movement of little ann, old dan
threw  a  fit.  he  started  barking  and
jumping. his long red tail fanned the air.

still  holding  onto  my  pole,  i  tried  to
take  a  step  backward.  my  feet  wouldn’t
move. a cold gripping fear came over me.
i  thought  my  legs  were  frozen.  i  made
another  effort  to  lift  my  leg.  it  moved.  i

realized that my feet were stuck in the soft
muddy bottom.

i started backing out, dragging the body
of my little dog. i couldn’t feel the pole in
my  hands.  when  my  feet  touched  the  icy
bank,  i  couldn’t  feel  that  either.  all  the
feeling in my body was gone.

i  wrapped  little  ann  in  my  coat  and
hurried  into  my  clothes.  with  the  pole  i
fished my light back.

close by was a large drift. i climbed up
on top of it and dug a hole down through
the  ice  and  snow  until  i  reached  the  dry
limbs.  i  poured  half  of  the  oil  in  my
lantern down into the hole and dropped in
a match. in no time i had a roaring fire.

i laid little ann close to the warm heat
and  went  to  work.  old  dan  washed  her
head  with  his  warm  red  tongue  while  i

i could tell by her cries when the blood
started  circulating.  little  by  little  her
strength came back. i stood her on her feet
and  started  walking  her.  she  was  weak
and wobbly but i knew she would live. i
felt  much  better  and  breathed  a  sigh  of
relief.

after drying myself out the best i could,
i  took  the  lantern  handle  from  the  pole,
bent  it  back  to  its  original  position,  and
put it back on the lantern. holding the light
out in front of me, i looked at it. the bright
metal gleamed in the firelight glow.

massaged and rubbed her body.

i  started  talking  to  it.  i  said,  “thanks,
old  lantern,  more  than  you’ll  ever  know.
i’ll  always  take  care  of  you. your  globe
will always be clean and there’ll never be
any rust or dirt on your frame.”

i knew if it had not been for the miracle
of  the  lantern,  my  little  dog  would  have
met  her  death  on  that  night.  her  grave
would  have  been  the  cold  icy  waters  of
the illinois river.

out  in  the  river  i  could  hear  the  cold
water gurgling in the icy trough. it seemed
to  be  angry.  it  hissed  and  growled  as  it
tore
the  channel.  i
shuddered  to  think  of  what  could  have
happened.

its  way

through

before i left for home, i walked back to
the  sycamore  tree.  once  again  i  said  a
prayer,  but  this  time  the  words  were
different.  i  didn’t  ask  for  a  miracle.  in
every  way  a  young  boy  could,  i  said
“thanks.”  my  second  prayer  wasn’t  said
with just words. all of my heart and soul
was in it.

on  my  way  home  i  decided  not  to  say
anything  to  my  mother  and  father  about
little  ann’s  accident.  i  knew  it  would
scare  mama  and  she  might  stop  my
hunting.

reaching  our  house,  i  didn’t  hang  the
lantern  in  its  usual  place.  i  took  it  to  my
room and set it in a corner with the handle
standing up.

the next morning i started sneezing and
came  down  with  a  terrible  cold.  i  told
mama  i  had  gotten  my  feet  wet.  she
scolded  me  a  little  and  started  doctoring
me.

for three days and nights i stayed home.
all this time i kept checking the handle of
the  lantern.  my  sisters  shook  the  house
from  the  roof  to  the  floor  with  their
playing and romping, but the handle never

did fall.

i  went  to  my  mother  and  asked  her  if
god  answered  prayers  every  time  one
was said. she smiled and said, “no, billy,
not every time. he only answers the ones
that  are  said  from  the  heart. you  have  to
be sincere and believe in him.”

she wanted to know why i had asked.
i  said,  “oh,  i  just  wondered,  and

wanted to know.”

she  came  over  and  straightened  my
suspenders, saying, “that was a very nice
question  for  my  little  daniel  boone  to
ask.”

bending over, she started kissing me. i
finally squirmed away from her, feeling as
wet  as  a  dirt  dauber’s  nest.  my  mother
never could kiss me like a fellow should
be  kissed.  before  she  was  done  i  was

kissed  all  over.  it  always  made  me  feel
silly and baby-like. i tried to tell her that a
coon hunter wasn’t supposed to be kissed
that  way,  but  mama  never  could
understand things like that.

i  stomped  out  of  the  house  to  see  how

my dogs were.

xii

the fame of my dogs spread all over our part
of  the  ozarks.  they  were  the  best  in  the
country.  no  coon  hunter  came  into  my
grandfather’s store with as many pelts as i
did.  grandpa  never  overlooked  an
opportunity to brag. he told everyone the
story  of  my  dogs,  and  the  part  he  had
played in getting them.

the

many  was

time  some  farmer,
coming  to  our  home,  would  say,  “your
grandpa was telling me you got three big
coons over in pea vine hollow the other
night.” i would listen, knowing i only got
one, or maybe none, but grandpa was my
pal. if he said i caught ten in one tree, it

was just that way.

because  of  my  grandfather’s  bragging,
and his firm belief in my dogs and me, a
terrible thing happened.

one  morning,  while  having  breakfast,
mama  said  to  papa,  “i’m  almost  out  of
corn meal. do you think you can go to the
mill today?”

papa said, “i intended to butcher a hog.
we’re about out of meat.” looking at me,
he said, “shell a sack of corn. take one of
the  mules  and  go  to  the  mill  for  your
mother.”

with the help of my sisters, we shelled
the  corn.  throwing  it  over  our  mule’s
back, i started for the store.

on arriving at the millhouse, i tied my
mule  to  the  hitching  post,  took  my  corn,
and set it by the door. i walked over to the

store  and  told  grandpa  i  wanted  to  get
some corn ground.

he  said,  “i’ll  be  with  you  in  just  a

minute.”

as  i  was  waiting,  i  heard  a  horse
coming.  looking  out,  i  saw  who  it  was
and didn’t like what i saw. it was the two
youngest  pritchard  boys.  i  had  run  into
them  on  several  occasions  during  pie
suppers and dances.

the pritchards were a large family that
lived upriver about five miles. as in most
small  country  communities,  there  is  one
family  that  no  one  likes.  the  pritchards
were  it.  tales  were  told  that  they  were
bootleggers,  thieves,  and  just  all-round
“no-accounts.”  the  story  had  gone  round
that  old  man  pritchard  had  killed  a  man
somewhere in missouri before moving to

rubin  was  two  years  older  than  i,  big
and husky for his age. he never had much
to  say.  he  had  mean-looking  eyes  that
were set far back in his rugged face. they
were smoky-hued and unblinking, as if the
eyelids  were  paralyzed.  i  had  heard  that
once  he  had  cut  a  boy  with  a  knife  in  a
fight over at the sawmill.

rainie was the youngest, about my age.
he had the meanest disposition of any boy
i had ever known. because of this he was
disliked  by  young  and  old.  wherever
rainie went, trouble seemed to follow. he
was always wanting to bet, and would bet
on  anything.  he  was  nervous,  and  could
never seem to stand still.

our part of the country.

once  at  my  grandfather’s  store,  i  had
given  him  a  piece  of  candy.  snatching  it

out of my hand, he ate it and then sneered
at me and said it wasn’t any good. during
a pie supper one night, he wanted to bet a
dime that he could whip me.

my mother told me always to be kind of
rainie, that he couldn’t help being the way
he was. i asked, “why?” she said it was
because his brothers were always picking
on him and beating him.

on entering the store, they stopped and
glared  at  me.  rubin  walked  over  to  the
counter. rainie came over to me.

leering at me, he said, “i’d like to make

a bet with you.”

i told him i didn’t want to bet.
he asked if i was scared.
“no. i just don’t want to bet,” i said.
his neck and ears looked as though they
hadn’t been washed in months. his ferret-

like  eyes  kept  darting  here  and  there.
glancing  down  to  his  hands,  i  saw  the
back  of  his  right  sleeve  was  stiff  and
starchy  from  the  constant  wiping  of  his
nose.

he  saw  i  was  looking  him  over,  and

asked if i liked what i saw.

i  started  to  say,  “no,”  but  didn’t,

turned, and walked away a few steps.

rubin ordered some chewing tobacco.

grandpa  handed  two  plugs  to  him.  he
paid for it, turned around, and handed one
plug  to  rainie.  holding  the  other  up  in
front of him, he looked it over. looking at
grandpa, he gnawed at one corner of it.

chewing?” grandpa asked.

“ain’t  for  me.  it’s  for  my  dad,”  rubin

growled.

grandpa mumbled something about how
kids were brought up these days. he came
from  behind  the  counter,  saying  to  me,
“let’s go grind that corn.”

the  pritchard  boys  made  no  move  to

follow us out of the store.

“come  on,”  grandpa  said.  “i’m  going

to lock up till i get this corn ground.”

“we’ll just stay here. i want to look at

some of the shirts,” said rubin.

“no, you won’t,” said grandpa. “come

on, i’m going to lock up.”

begrudgingly, they walked out.
i helped grandpa start the mill and we
proceeded to grind the corn. the pritchard
boys  had  followed  us  and  were  standing
looking on.

rainie walked over to me. “i hear you

have some good hounds,” he said.

i told him i had the best in the country.
if he didn’t believe me, he could just ask
my grandfather.

he  just  leered  at  me.  “i  don’t  think
they’re half as good as you say they are,”
he said. “bet our old blue tick hound can
out-hunt both of them.”

i laughed, “ask grandpa who brings in

the most hides.”
“i  wouldn’t

i  let  him  know  right  quick  that  my

grandfather wasn’t crooked.

“he’s a storekeeper, ain’t he?” he said.
i  glanced  over  at  grandpa.  he  had
heard  the  remark  made  by  rainie.  his
friendly  old  face  was  as  red  as  a  turkey
gobbler’s wattle.

the  last  of  my  corn  was  just  going

pushed a lever to one side, shutting off the
power. he came over and said to rainie,
“what do you do? just go around looking

grandpa glared at rubin. “any bet you
would make sure would be a good one all

rubin spat a mouthful of tobacco juice
on the clean floor. he said, “well, we’ve
heard  so  much  about  them  hounds  of  his,
we  just  think  it’s  a  lot  of  talk  and  lies.
we’d  like  to  make  a  little  bet;  say  about

was  a  sickly,  paste-gray  color.  the  kind
old eyes behind the glasses burned with a
fire i had never seen.

in  a  loud  voice,  he  asked,  “bet  on

what?”

rubin  spat  again.  grandpa’s  eyes
followed the brown stain in its arch until
it landed on the clean floor and splattered.
with  a  leering  grin  on  his  ugly,  dirty
face,  rubin  said,  “well,  we  got  an  old
coon  up  in  our  part  of  the  country  that’s
been  there  a  long  time. ain’t  no  dog  yet

rainie broke into the conversation, “he

rubin told rainie to shut up and let him
do  the  talking.  looking  over  at  me,  he
said, “what do you say? want to bet two
dollars your hounds can tree him?”

i looked at my grandfather, but he didn’t

help me.

i told rubin i didn’t want to bet, but i
was  pretty  sure  my  dogs  could  tree  the
ghost coon.

rainie  butted  in  again,  “what’s  the

matter? you ‘yellow’?”

i  felt  the  hot  blood  rush  into  my  face.
my stomach felt like something alive was
crawling  in  it.  i  doubled  up  my  right  fist
and  was  on  the  point  of  hitting  rainie  in

one  of  his  eyes  when

i  looked  up.  his  eyes  flashed  as  he
looked  at  me. a  strange  little  smile  was
tugging at the corner of his mouth. the big
artery in his neck was pounding out and in.
it  reminded  me  of  a  young  bird  that  had
fallen  out  of  a  nest  and  lay  dying  on  the
ground.

still looking at me, he reached back and
took  his  billfold  from  his  pocket,  saying,
“let’s call that bet.” turning to rubin, he
said,  “i’m  going  to  let  him  call  your  bet,
but now you listen. if you boys take him up
there to hunt the ghost coon, and jump on
him and beat him up, you’re sure going to
hear  from  me.  i  don’t  mean  maybe.  i’ll
have  both  of  you  taken  to  tahlequah  and
put in jail. you had better believe that.”

rubin

saw  he  had  pushed  my
grandfather  far  enough.  backing  up  a
couple of steps, he said, “we’re not going
to jump on him. all we want to do is make
a bet.”

grandpa  handed  me  two  one-dollar
bills,  saying  to  rubin,  “you  hold  your
money  and  he  can  hold  his.  if  you  lose,
you  had  better  pay  off.”  looking  back  to
me, he said, “son, if you lose, pay off.”

i nodded my head.
i  asked  rubin  when  he  wanted  me  to

come up for the hunt.

he thought a minute. “you know where
that old log slide comes out from the hills
onto the road?” he asked.

i nodded.
“we’ll  meet  you  there  tomorrow  night

it  was  fine  with  me,  i  said,  but  i  told
him not to bring his hounds because mine
wouldn’t hunt with other dogs.

he said he wouldn’t.
i agreed to bring my ax and lantern.
as they turned to leave, rainie smirked.

“sucker!” he said.
i made no reply.
after  the  pritchard  boys  had  gone,  my
grandfather looked at me and said, “son, i
have  never  asked  another  man  for  much,
but  i  sure  want  you  to  catch  the  ghost
coon.”

i  told  him  if  the  ghost  coon  made  one
track in the river bottoms, my dogs would
get him.

grandpa laughed.
“you’d  better  be  getting  home.  it’s
getting late and your mother is waiting for

i could hear him chuckling as he walked
toward  his  store.  i  thought  to  myself,
“there  goes  the  best  grandpa  a  boy  ever
had.”

lifting  the  sack  of  meal  to  the  back  of
my  old  mule,  i  started  for  home. all  the
way,  i  kept  thinking  of  old  dan,  little
ann, ghost coons, and the two ugly, dirty
pritchard  boys.  i  decided  not  to  tell  my
mother  and  father  anything  about  the  hunt
for  i  knew  mama  wouldn’t  approve  of
anything i had to do with the pritchards.

the corn meal,” he said.

the  following  evening  i  arrived  at  the
designated spot early. i sat down by a red
oak tree to wait. i called little ann over
to me and had a good talk with her. i told
her  how  much  i  loved  her,  scratched  her
back, and looked at the pads of her feet.

seemed

and
answered by washing my face and hands.
i tried to talk to old dan, but i may as
well  have  talked  to  a  stump  for  all  the
attention  he  paid  to  me.  he  kept  walking
around  sniffing  here  and
there.  he
couldn’t understand why we were waiting.
he was wanting to hunt.

rubin  and  rainie  showed  up  just  at

dark. both had sneers on their faces.

“are you ready?” rubin asked.
“yes,” i said, and asked him which way

was the best to go.

“let’s  go  downriver  a  way  and  work
up,”  he  said.  “we’re  sure  to  strike  him

coming  upriver,  and  that  way  we’ve  got
the wind in our favor.”

“are these the hounds that we’ve been

hearing so much about?” rainie asked.

i nodded.
“they  look  too  little  to  be  any  good,”

he said.

packages.

i  told  him  dynamite  came  in  little

he asked me if i had my two dollars.
“yes,” i said.
he wanted to see my money. i showed
it  to  him.  rubin,  not  to  be  outdone,
showed me his.

we crossed an old field and entered the
river  bottoms.  by  this  time  it  was  quite
dark. i lit my lantern and asked which one
wanted to carry my ax.

“it’s  yours,”  rainie  said.  “you  carry

it.”

not wanting to argue, i carried both the

lantern and the ax.

rainie started telling me how stingy and
crooked my grandfather was. i told him i
hadn’t  come  to  have  any  trouble  or  to
fight. all  i  wanted  to  do  was  to  hunt  the
ghost  coon.  if  there  was  going  to  be  any
trouble, i would just call my dogs and go
home.

rubin had a nickel’s worth of sense, but
rainie had none at all. rubin told him if
he didn’t shut up, he was going to bloody
his nose. that shut rainie up.

old  dan  opened  up  first.  it  was  a
beautiful thing to hear. the deep tones of
his voice rolled in the silent night.

a  bird  in  a  canebrake  on  our  right
started chirping. a big swamp rabbit came

running  down  the  riverbank  as  if  all  hell
was  close  to  his  heels.  a  bunch  of
mallards,  feeding  in  the  shallows  across
the  river,
took  flight  with  frightened
quacks. a feeling that only a hunter knows
slowly crept over my body. i whooped to
my dogs, urging them on.

little ann came in. her bell-like tones
blended  with  old  dan’s,
in  perfect
rhythm.  we  stood  and  listened  to  the
beautiful music, the deep-throated notes of
hunting hounds on the hot-scented trail of a
river coon.

rubin said, “if he crosses the river up
at  the  buck  ford,  it’s  the  ghost  coon,  as
that’s the way he always runs.”

we stood and listened. sure enough, the
voices  of  my  dogs  were  silent  for  a  few
minutes.  old  dan,  a  more  powerful

swimmer than little ann, was the first to
open  up  after  crossing  over.  she  was
close behind him.

rubin  said,  “that’s  him,  all  right.

that’s the ghost coon.”

they crossed the river again.
we waited.
rainie said, “you may as well get your

money out now.”

i told him just to wait a while, and i’d

show him the ghost coon’s hide.

this brought a loud laugh from rainie,
which sounded like someone had dropped
an empty bucket on a gravel bar and then
had kicked it.

the  wily  old  coon  crossed  the  river
several times, but couldn’t shake my dogs
from his trail. he cut out from the bottoms,
walked  a  rail  fence,  and  jumped  from  it

into  a  thick  canebrake.  he  piled  into  an
old  slough.  where  it  emptied  into  the
river,  he  swam  to  the  middle.  doing
opposite to what most coons do, which is
swim downstream, he swam upstream. he
stopped at an old drift in the middle of it.
little ann found him. when she jumped
him  from  the  drift,  old  dan  was  far
downriver  searching  for  the  trail.  if  he
could  have  gotten  there  in  time,  it  would
have  been  the  last  of  the  ghost  coon,  but
little ann couldn’t do much by herself in
the  water.  he  fought  his  way  free  from
her, swam to our side, and ran upstream.

i  could  hear  old  dan  coming  through
the  bottoms  on  the  other  side,  bawling  at
every jump. i could feel the driving power
in his voice. we heard him when he hit the
water to cross over. it sounded like a cow

had jumped in.

little  ann  was  warming  up  the  ghost
coon.  i  could  tell  by  her  voice  that  she
was close to him.

reaching  our  side,  old  dan  tore  out
after her. he was a mad hound. his deep
voice was telling her he was coming.

we  were  trotting  along,  following  my
dogs,  when  i  heard  little ann’s  bawling
stop.

“wait a minute,” i said. “i think she has
treed him. let’s give her time to circle the
tree to make sure he’s there.”

old  dan  opened  up  bawling  treed.

rubin started on.

coon ate her up.”

“something’s  wrong,”  i  said.  “i  can’t

rainie  spoke  up,  “maybe  the  ghost

i glared at him.
hurrying on, we came to my dogs. old
dan  was  bawling  at  a  hole  in  a  large
sycamore that had fallen into the river.

at  that  spot,  the  bank  was  a  good  ten
feet above the water level. as the big tree
had  fallen,  the  roots  had  been  torn  and
twisted from the ground. the jagged roots,
acting  as  a  drag,  had  stopped  it  from
falling  all  the  way  into  the  stream.  the
trunk lay on a steep slant from the top of
the  bank  to  the  water.  looking  down,  i
could  see  the  broken  tangled  mass  of  the
top. debris from floods had caught in the
limbs, forming a drift.

old dan was trying to dig and gnaw his
way  into  the  log.  pulling  him  from  the
hole,  i  held  my  lantern  up  and  looked
down  into  the  dark  hollow.  i  knew  that

somewhere down below the surface there
had  to  be  another  hole  in  the  trunk,  as
water  had  filled  the  hollow  to  the  river
level.

rubin, looking over my shoulder, said,
“that coon couldn’t be in there. if he was,
he’d be drowned.”

i agreed.
rainie  spoke  up.  “you  ready  to  pay
off?”  he  asked.  “i  told  you  them  hounds
couldn’t tree the ghost coon.”

i told him the show wasn’t over.
little ann had never bawled treed, and
i  knew  she  wouldn’t  until  she  knew
exactly where the coon was. working the
bank  up  and  down,  and  not  finding  the
trail,  she  swam  across  the  river  and
worked  the  other  side.  for  a  good  half-
hour  she  searched  that  side  before  she

came back across to where old dan was.
she sniffed around the hollow log.

“we  might  as  well  get  away  from
here,”  rainie  said.  “they  ain’t  going  to
find the ghost coon.”

“it sure looks that way,” rubin said.
i told them i wasn’t giving up until my

dogs did.

“you just want to be stubborn,” rubin

said. “i’m ready for my money now.”
i asked him to wait a few minutes.
“ain’t no use,” he said. “no hound yet

ever treed that ghost coon.”

hearing a whine, i turned around. little
ann  had  crawled  up  on  the  log  and  was
inching  her  way  down  the  slick  trunk
toward the water. i held my lantern up so i
could  see  better.  spraddle-legged,  claws
digging into the bark, she was easing her

“you’d  better  get  her  out  of  there,”
rubin said. “if she gets down in that old
tree top, she’ll drown.”

rubin didn’t know my little ann.
once  her  feet  slipped.  i  saw  her  hind
quarters fall off to one side. she didn’t get
scared. slowly she eased her legs back up
on the log.

i  made  no  reply.  i  just  watched  and

way down.

waited.

little ann eased herself into the water.
swimming to the drift, she started sniffing
around. in places it was thin and her legs
would  break  through.  climbing,  clawing,
and  swimming,  she  searched  the  drift
over, looking for the lost trail.

i saw when she stopped searching. with
her  body  half  in  the  water,  and  her  front

feet curved over a piece of driftwood, she
turned  her  head  and  looked  toward  the
shore. i could see her head twisting from
side to side. i could tell by her actions that
she  had  gotten  the  scent.  with  a  low
whine, she started back.
told  rubin,  “i

think  she  smells

i

something.”

slowly  and  carefully  she  worked  her
way through the tangled mass. i lost sight
of  her  when  she  came  close  to  the
undermined  bank.  she  wormed  her  way
under  the  overhang.  i  could  hear  her
clawing  and  wallowing  around,  and  then
all  hell  broke  loose.  out  from  under  the
bank  came  the  biggest  coon  i  had  ever
seen, the ghost coon.

he came out right over little ann. she
caught him in the old treetop. i knew she

was no match for him in that tangled mass
of limbs and logs. he fought his way free
and swam for the opposite bank. she was
right behind him.

off

the

bank

ten-foot

old dan didn’t wait, look, or listen. he
piled
and
disappeared from sight. i looked for him. i
knew  he  was  tangled  in  the  debris  under
the  surface.  i  started  to  take  off  my
overalls, but stopped when i saw his red
head  shoot  up  out  of  the  water.  bawling
and clawing his way free of the limbs and
logs, he was on his way.

on reaching midstream, the ghost coon
headed downriver with little ann still on
his tail.

we ran down the riverbank. i could see
my  dogs  clearly  in  the  moonlight.  the
ghost coon was about fifteen feet ahead of

twenty-five  yards
little  ann.  about
behind them came old dan, trying so hard
to catch up. i whooped to them.

rubin grabbed a pole, saying, “he may

come out on this side.”

knowing the ghost coon was desperate,
i wondered what he would do. reaching a
gravel  bar  below  the  high  bank,  we  ran
out  on  it  to  the  water’s  edge.  then  the
ghost  coon  did  something  that  i  never
expected. coming even with us, he turned
from midstream and came straight for us.
i heard rubin yell, “here he comes!”
he  churned  his  way

the
shallows and ran right between us. rubin
swung  his  pole,  missed  the  coon,  and
almost hit little ann. the coon headed for
the  river  bottoms  with  her  right  on  his
heels.

through

the  bawling  of  little  ann  and  our
screaming  and  hollering  made  so  much
noise,  i  didn’t  hear  old  dan  coming.  he
tore out of the river, plowed into me, and
knocked me down.

we  ran  through  the  bottoms,  following
my  dogs.  i  thought  the  ghost  coon  was
going  back  to  the  sycamore  log  but  he
didn’t. he ran upriver.

while  hurrying  after  them,  i  looked
over at rainie. for once in his life, i think
he  was  excited.  he  was  whooping  and
screaming,  and  falling  over  logs  and
limbs.

i felt good all over.
glancing  over  at  me,  rainie  said,

“they ain’t got him yet.”

the  ghost  coon  crossed  the  river  time
after  time.  seeing  that  he  couldn’t  shake

old dan and little ann from his trail, he
cut  through  the  river  bottoms  and  ran  out
into an old field.

at this maneuver, rubin said to rainie,

“he’s heading for that tree.”

“what tree?” i asked.
“you’ll  see,”  rainie  said.  “when  he
gets  tired,  he  always  heads  for  that  tree.
that’s  where  he  gets  his  name,  the  ghost
coon. he just disappears.”

“if  he  disappears,  my  dogs  will

disappear with him,” i said.

rainie laughed.
i had to admit one thing. the pritchard
boys knew the habits of the ghost coon. i
knew  he  couldn’t  run  all  night.  he  had
already far surpassed any coon i had ever
chased.

“they’re just about there,” rubin said.

just then i heard old dan bark treed. i
waited  for  little  ann’s  voice.  i  didn’t
hear her. i wondered what it could be this
time.

“he’s  there  all  right,”  rubin  said.

“he’s in that tree.”

“well, come on,” i said. “i want to see

that tree.”

“you  might  as  well  get  your  money

out,” rainie said.

i told him he had said that once before,

back on the riverbank.

xiii

coming up to the tree, i could see it was a huge
bur  oak.  it  wasn’t  tall.  it  was  just  the
opposite, rather low and squatty. the top
was  a  thick  mass  of  large  limbs,  and  it
hadn’t shed all of its leaves yet.

it stood by itself in an old field. there
were no other trees within fifty yards of it.
about  fifteen  feet  to  the  left  were  the
remains  of  a  barbed-wire  fence.  an  old
gate hung by one rusty hinge from a large
corner post. i could tell that at one time a
house had stood close by.

rubin saw me looking around. “a long
time  ago  some  indians  lived  here  and
farmed these fields,” he said.

i walked around the tree looking for the
coon, but could see very little in the dark
shadows.

“ain’t no use to look,” rubin said. “he

won’t be there.”

rainie  spoke  up.  “this  ain’t  the  first

time we’ve been to this tree,” he said.

rubin told rainie to shut up. “you talk

too much,” he said.

in  a  whining  voice,  rainie  said,
“rubin,  you  know  the  coon  ain’t  in  that
tree. make him pay off and let’s go home.
i’m getting tired.”

i  told  rubin  i  was  going  to  climb  the

tree.

any good.”

“go  ahead,”  he  said.  “it  won’t  do  you

the tree was easy to climb. i looked all
over  it,  on  each  limb,  and  in  every  dark

place.  i  looked  for  a  hollow.  the  ghost
coon wasn’t there. i climbed back down,
scolded old dan to stop his loud bawling,
and looked for little ann.

i  saw  her  far  up  the  old  fence  row,
sniffing and running here and there. i knew
the ghost coon had pulled a real trick, but i
couldn’t figure out what it was. little ann
had never yet barked treed. i knew if the
coon was in the tree she wouldn’t still be
searching for a trail.

old dan started working again.
my  dogs  covered

the  field.  they
circled and circled. they ran up and down
the barbed-wire fence on both sides.

i  knew  the  coon  hadn’t  walked  the
barbed  wire.  ghost  or  no  ghost,  he
couldn’t do that. i walked over to the old
gate  and  looked  around.  i  sat  down  and

stared up into the tree. little ann came to
me.

old  dan,  giving  up  his  search,  came
back  to  the  tree  and  bawled  a  couple  of
times. i scolded him again.

rubin  came  over.  leering  at  me,  he

said, “you give up?”

i didn’t answer.
little ann once again started searching
for  the  lost  trail.  old  dan  went  to  help
her.

rainie  said,  “i

that  you
couldn’t  tree  the  ghost  coon.  why  don’t
you pay off so we can go home?”

told  you

i  told  him  i  hadn’t  given  up.  my  dogs
were  still  hunting.  when  they  gave  up,  i
would, too.

rubin  said,  “well,  we’re  not  going  to

stay here all night.”

looking  back  to  the  tree,  i  thought
perhaps  i  had  overlooked  something.  i
told rubin i was going to climb it again.

he  laughed,  “go  ahead.  won’t  do  any
good.  you  climbed  it  once.  ain’t  you
satisfied?”

“no,  i’m  not  satisfied,”  i  said.  “i  just

don’t believe in ghost coons.”

rubin  said,  “i  don’t  believe  in  ghosts
either, but facts are facts. to tell you the
truth, i’ve climbed that tree a dozen times
and  there  just  ain’t  no  place  in  it  for  a
coon to hide.”

rainie  spoke  up.  “our  old  blue  hound
has treed the ghost coon in this tree more
times  than  one.  maybe  you  two  don’t
believe in ghosts, but i do. why don’t you
pay off so we can get away from here?”

“i’ll climb it one more time,” i said. “if

i can’t find him, i’ll pay off.”

climbing  up  again,  i  searched  and
searched. when i got through, i knew the
ghost  coon  wasn’t  in  that  tree.  when  i
came down, i saw my dogs had given up.
that  took  the  last  resistance  out  of  me.  i
knew if they couldn’t find the ghost coon, i
couldn’t.

digging the two one-dollar bills out of
my pocket, i walked over to rubin. little
ann was by my side. i handed my money
over,  saying,  “well,  you  won  it  fair  and
square.”

with a grin on his face, rubin took my
money. he said, “i bet this will break your
old grandpa’s heart.”

i didn’t reply.
reaching  down,  i  caught  little  ann’s
head in my hands. looking into her warm

friendly  eyes,  i  said,  “it’s  all  right,  little
girl, we haven’t given up yet. we’ll come
back. we may never catch the ghost coon,
but  we’ll  run  him  until  he  leaves  the
country.

she licked my hands and whined.
a small breeze began to stir. glancing
up  into  the  tree,  i  saw  some  leaves
shaking.  i  said  to  rubin,  “looks  like  the
wind  is  coming  up.  it  may  blow  up  a
storm. we’d better be heading for home.”
just as i turned, i saw little ann throw
up  her  head  and  whine.  her  body  grew
stiff  and  taut.  i  watched  her.  she  was
testing  the  wind.  i  knew  she  had  scented
something in the breeze. stiff-legged, head
high in the air, she started walking toward
the tree. almost there, she turned back and
stopped.  i  knew  she  had  caught  the  scent

but  could  only  catch  it  when  a  breeze
came.

looking at rubin, i said, “i haven’t lost

that two dollars yet.”

another  breeze  drifted  out  of  the  river
bottoms. little ann caught the scent again.
slowly  she  walked  straight  to  the  large
gatepost,  reared  up  on  it  with  her  front
feet,  and  bawled  the  most  beautiful  tree
bark i ever heard in my life.

old  dan,  not  understanding  why  little
ann  was  bawling,  stood  and  looked.  he
walked  over  to  the  post,  reared  up  on  it,
and  sniffed.  then,  raising  his  head,  he
shook the dead leaves in the bur oak tree
with his deep voice.

i  looked  at  rainie.  laughing,  i  said,
“there’s  your  ghost  coon.  now  what  do
you think of my dogs?”

for once he made no reply.
going over to the post, i saw it was a
large  black  locust  put  there  many  years
ago  to  hang  the  gate.  looking  up  at  the
tree, i saw how the ghost coon had pulled
his trick. one large long limb ran out and
hung directly over the gate. it was a drop
of  a  good  twelve  feet  from  the  branch  to
the  top  of  the  gatepost,  but  i  knew  we
weren’t after an ordinary coon. this was
the ghost coon.

i said to rubin, “boost me up and i’ll

see if the post is hollow.”

after breaking off a long jimson weed
to  use  as  a  prod,  i  got  up  on  rubin’s
shoulder,  and  he  raised  me  up.  the  post
was  hollow.  not  knowing  how  far  down
the  hole  went,  i  started  the  switch  down.
about  halfway,  i  felt  something  soft.  i

i heard him coming. he boiled out right
in my face. i let go of everything. hitting
the ground, i rolled over on my back and
looked up.

for  a  split  second,  the  ghost  coon
stayed  on  top  of  the  post,  and  then  he
jumped. my dogs were on him the instant
he hit the ground. the fight was on.

gave it a hard jab.

i knew the coon didn’t have a chance as
he  wasn’t  in  the  waters  of  the  river.  he
didn’t give up easily even though he was
on  dry  land.  he  was  fighting  for  his  life
and a good account he gave. he fought his
way  to  freedom,  and  made  it  back  to  the
bur oak tree. he was a good six feet up the
side  when  old  dan,  leaping  high  in  the
air, caught him and pulled him back down.
at the foot of the tree, the fight went on.

again the ghost coon fought his way free.
this  time  he  made  it  and  disappeared  in
the dark shadows of the tree. old dan was
furious.  never  before  had  i  seen  a  coon
get away from him.

i told rubin i would climb up and run
him out. as i started climbing, i saw little
ann  go  to  one  side  and  old  dan  to  the
other. my dogs would never stay together
when  they  had  treed  a  coon,  so  that  any
way he left a tree, he was met by one of
them.

about halfway up, far out on a limb, i
found the ghost coon. as i started toward
him,  my  dogs  stopped  bawling.  i  heard
something  i  had  heard  many  times.  the
sound was like the cry of a small baby. it
was  the  cry  of  a  ringtail  coon  when  he
knows  it  is  the  end  of  the  trail.  i  never

liked to hear this cry, but it was all in the
game, the hunter and the hunted.

as i sat there on the limb, looking at the
old  fellow,  he  cried  again.  something
came over me. i didn’t want to kill him.

i hollered down and told rubin i didn’t

want to kill the ghost coon.

he hollered back, “are you crazy?”
i  told  him  i  wasn’t  crazy.  i  just  didn’t

want to kill him.

i climbed down.
rubin  was  mad.  he  said,  “what’s  the

matter with you?”

“nothing,” i told him. “i just don’t have

the heart to kill the coon.”

i told him there were plenty more; why
kill  him?  he  had  lived  here  a  long  time,
and  more  than  one  hunter  had  listened  to
the  voices  of  his  hounds  bawling  on  his

trail.

out.”

that’s what it is.”

i  didn’t  like  that  but,  not  wanting  to

argue, i didn’t say anything.

rubin  said,  “i’ll  go  up  and  run  him

rainie  said,  “he’s  chicken-livered,

“i won’t let my dogs kill him,” i said.
rubin glared at me. “i’m going up and
run  that  coon  out,”  he  said.  “if  you  stop
your  dogs,  i’m  going  to  beat  you  half  to
death.”

“do it anyway, rubin,” rainie said.
“i’ve a good mind to,” said rubin.
just as rubin started to climb the tree,
old dan growled. he was staring into the
darkness. something was coming.

“what’s that?” i asked.
“i  don’t  know,”  rubin  said.  “don’t

sound like anything i ever heard.”

“it’s  ghosts,”  rainie  said.  “let’s  get

away from here.”

an  animal  was  coming  out  of  the
darkness. it was walking slowly in an odd
way, as if it were walking sideways. the
hair on the back of my neck stood straight
out.

as the animal came closer, rainie said,
“why,  it’s  old  blue.  how  did  he  get
loose?”

it was a big blue tick hound. around his
neck was a piece of rope about three feet
long. one could see that the rope had been
gnawed  in  two.  the  frayed  end  had
become  entangled  in  a  fair-sized  dead
limb.  dragging  the  limb  was  what  made
the  dog  look  so  odd.  i  felt  much  better
when i found out what it was.

the  blue  tick  hound  was  like  the
pritchards,  mean  and  ugly.  he  was  a  big
dog,  tall  and  heavy.  his  chest  was  thick
and solid. he came up growling. the hair
on  his  back  was  standing  straight  up.  he
walked  stiff-legged  around  old  dan,
showing his teeth.

i  told  rainie  he  had  better  get  hold  of

his dog, or there was sure to be a fight.

“you  better  get  hold  of  your  dog,”  he
said. “i’m not worried about old blue. he
can take care of himself.”

i said no more.
“don’t make no difference now whether
you  kill  the  ghost  coon  or  not,”  rubin
said. “old blue will take care of him.”

i knew the killing of the coon was out of
my  control,  but  i  didn’t  want  to  see  him
die.  i  said  to  rubin,  “just  give  back  my

two dollars and i’ll go home. i can’t keep
you  from  killing  him,  but  i  don’t  have  to
stay and see it.”

“rubin,  don’t  give  him  the  money,”
rainie  said.  “he  ain’t  killed  the  ghost
coon.”

“that’s  right,”  rubin  said.  “you  ain’t,
and  i  wouldn’t  let  you  now,  even  if  you
wanted to.”

i told them my dogs had treed the ghost
coon and that was the bet, to tree the ghost
coon.

“no, it wasn’t,” rubin said. “you said

you would kill him.”

“it  was  no  such  thing,”  i  said.  “i’ve

done all i said i would.”

rubin  walked  up  in  front  of  me.  he
said, “i ain’t going to give you the money.
you didn’t win it fair. now what are you

going to do about it?”

i looked into his mean eyes. i started to

make some reply, but decided against it.

he  saw  my  hesitation,  and  said,  “you
better  get  your  dogs  and  get  out  of  here
before you get whipped.”

in  a  loud  voice,  rainie  said,  “bloody

his nose, rubin.”

i

i was scared. i couldn’t whip rubin. he
was  too  big  for  me.  i  started  to  turn  and
leave  when
thought  of  what  my
grandfather had told them.

“you  had  better  remember  what  my
grandpa said,” i reminded them. “he’ll do
just what he said he would.”

rubin didn’t hit me. he just grabbed me
and with his brute strength threw me down
on the ground. he had me on my back with
my arms outspread. he had a knee on each

arm. i made no effort to fight back. i was
scared.

“if  you  say  one  word  to  your  grandpa
about  this,”  rubin  said,  “i’ll  catch  you
hunting  some  night  and  take  my  knife  to
you.”

looking up into his ugly face, i knew he
would do just what he said. i told him to
let  me  up  and  i  would  go  and  not  say
anything to anyone.

“don’t let him up, rubin,” rainie said.
“beat the hell out of him, or hold him and
let me do it.”

just  then  i  heard  growling,  and  a
commotion off to one side. the blue hound
had finally gotten a fight out of old dan.
turning  my  head  sideways,  i  could  see
them  standing  on  their  hind  legs,  tearing
and slashing at each other. the weight of

the big hound pushed old dan over.

i  told  rubin  to  let  me  up  so  we  could

stop the fight.

he laughed, “while my dog is whipping
yours,  i  think  i’ll  just  work  you  over  a
little.”  so  saying,  he  jerked  my  cap  off,
and started whipping me in the face with
it.

i  heard  rainie  yell,  “rubin,  they’re

killing old blue.”

rubin jumped up off me.
i clambered up and looked over to the
fight.  what  i  saw  thrilled  me.  faithful
little ann, bitch though she was, had gone
to the assistance of old dan.

i knew my dogs were very close to each
other. everything they did was done as a
combination,  but  i  never  expected  this.  it
is a very rare occasion for a bitch dog to

fight another dog, but fight she did.

i could see that little ann’s jaws were
glued  to  the  throat  of  the  big  hound.  she
would never loosen that deadly hold until
the last breath of life was gone.

old dan was tearing and slashing at the
soft belly. i knew the destruction his long
sharp teeth were causing.

again  rainie  yelled,  “rubin,  they’re
killing him. they’re killing old blue. do
something quick.”

rubin darted over to one side, grabbed
my ax from the ground, and said in a loud
voice, “i’ll kill them damn hounds.”

at the thought of what he was going to
do with the ax, i screamed and ran for my
dogs.  rubin  was  about  ten  feet  ahead  of
me, bent over, running with the ax held out
in front of him. i knew i could never get to

them in time.

i was screaming, “no, rubin, no!”
i  saw  the  small  stick  when  it  whipped
up from the ground. as if it were alive, it
caught  between  rubin’s  legs.  i  saw  him
fall. i ran on by.

reaching  the  dogfight,  i  saw  the  big
hound was almost gone. he had long since
ceased  fighting.  his  body  lay  stretched
full-length  on  the  ground.  i  grabbed  old
dan’s collar and pulled him back. it was
different with little ann. pull as i might,
she wouldn’t let go of the hound’s throat.
her jaws were locked.

i  turned  old  dan  loose  and,  getting
astraddle  of  little ann,  i  pried  her  jaws
apart with my hands. old dan had darted
back  in.  grabbing  his  collar  again,  i
pulled them off to one side.

the  blue  hound  lay  where  he  was.  i
thought perhaps he was already dead, and
then i saw him move a little.

still holding my dogs by their collars, i
looked back. i couldn’t understand what i
saw.  rubin  was  laying  where  he  had
fallen.  his  back  was  toward  me,  and  his
body was bent in a “u” shape. rainie was
standing  on  the  other  side  of  him,  staring
down.

i  hollered  and  asked  rainie,  “what’s

the matter?”

he  didn’t  answer.  he  just  stood  as
though in a trance, staring down at rubin.
i hollered again. he still didn’t answer.
i  didn’t  know  what  to  do.  i  couldn’t  turn
my  dogs  loose.  they  would  go  for  the
hound again.

again  i  hollered  at  rainie,  asking  him

to  come  and  help  me.  he  neither  moved
nor answered. i had to do something.

looking  around,  my  glance  fell  on  the
old barbed-wire fence. i led my dogs to it.
holding onto their collars with one hand, i
worked  a  rusty  barbed  wire  backwards
and  forwards  against  a  staple  until  it
broke.  running  the  end  of  it  under  their
collars, i tied them up. they made two or
three  lunges  toward  the  hound,  but  the
wire held.

i walked over and stopped at rainie’s

side. i again asked, “what’s the matter?”

he said not a word.
i  could  see  that  rainie  was  paralyzed
with  fright.  his  mouth  and  eyes  were
opened wide, and his face was as white as
chalk. i laid my hand on his shoulder. at
the  touch  of  my  hand,  he  jumped  and

screamed.  still  screaming,  he  turned  and
started  running.  i  watched  him  until  he
disappeared in the darkness.

looking down at rubin, i saw what had
paralyzed  rainie.  when  rubin  had
tripped,  he  had  fallen  on  the  ax.  as  it
entered  his  stomach,  the  sharp  blade  had
sunk to the eye of the double-bitted ax.

turning my back to the horrible sight, i
closed  my  eyes.  the  muscles  in  my
stomach knotted and jerked. a nauseating
sickness spread over my body. i couldn’t
look at him.

i heard rubin whisper. turning around,
i knelt down by his side with my back to
the ax. i couldn’t understand what he was
whispering.  kneeling  down  closer,  i
heard and understood. in a faint voice, he
said, “take it out of me.”

of me.”

turning  around,  i  saw  his  hands  were
curled around the protruding blade as if he
himself  had  tried  to  pull  it  from  his
stomach.

i hesitated.
again  he  pleaded,  “please,  take  it  out

how  i  did  it,  i’ll  never  know.  putting
my  hands  over  his  and  pressing  down,  i
pulled the ax from the wound. the blood
gushed.  i  felt  the  warm  heat  as  it  spread
over  my  hands. again  the  sickness  came
over  me.  i  stumbled  to  my  feet  and
stepped back a few paces.

seeing  a  movement  from  rubin,  i
thought  he  was  going  to  get  up.  with  his
hands, he pushed himself halfway up. his
eyes  were  wide  open,  staring  straight  at
me.  stopping  in  his  effort  of  getting  up,

still staring at me, his mouth opened as if
to  say  something.  words  never  came.
instead, a large red bubble slowly worked
its way out of his mouth and burst. he fell
back to the ground. i knew he was dead.

scared,  not  knowing  what  to  do,  i
called for rainie. i got no answer. i called
his  name  again  and  again.  i  could  get  no
reply. my voice echoed in the darkness of
the silent night. a cold chill ran over my
body.

i suppose it is natural at a time like that
for a boy to think of his mother. i thought
of mine. i wanted to get home.

going  over  to  my  dogs,  i  glanced  to
where the blue hound was. he was trying
to get up. i was glad he wasn’t dead.

picking  up  my  lantern,  i  thought  of  my
ax. i left it. i didn’t care if i never saw it

knowing i couldn’t turn my dogs loose,
i  broke  off  enough  of  the  wire  to  lead
them. as  i  passed  under  the  branches  of
the bur oak tree, i looked up into the dark
foliage. i could see the bright eyes of the
ghost coon. everything that had happened
on  this  terrible  night  was  because  of  his
very existence, but it wasn’t his fault.

i also knew he was a silent witness to
the horrible scene. behind me lay the still
body  of  a  young  boy.  on  my  left  a  blue
tick  hound  lay  torn  and  bleeding.  even
after all that had happened, i could feel no
hatred  for  the  ghost  coon  and  was  not
sorry i had let him live.

again.

arriving  home,  i  awakened  my  mother
and  father.  starting  at  my  grandfather’s
mill, i told everything that had happened. i

left  nothing  out.  my  mother  had  started
crying  long  before  i  had  completed  my
story.  papa  said  nothing,  just  sat  and
listened.  when  i  had  finished,  he  kept
staring down at the floor in deep thought. i
could hear the sobbing of my mother in the
silence. i walked over to her. she put her
arms around me and said, “my poor little
boy.”

looking at me, he said, “you go across
the  river  and  get  old  man  lowery,  and
you  may  as  well  go  on  up  and  tell  the

getting to his feet, papa reached for his
coat  and  hat.  mama  asked  him  where  he
was going.

“well,  i’ll  have  to  go  up  there,”  he
said. “i’m going to get grandpa, for he is
the  only  man  in  the  country  that  has
authority to move the body.”

bufords, too. tell them to meet us at your
grandfather’s place.”

i hurried to carry the sad message.
the  following  day  was  a  nasty  one. a
slow,  cold  drizzle  had  set  in.  feeling
trapped indoors, i prowled from room to
room. i couldn’t understand why my father
hadn’t  come  back  from  the  pritchards’.  i
sat by the window and watched the road.

understanding my feelings, mama said,
“billy,  i  wouldn’t  worry.  he’ll  be  back
before  long.  it  takes  time  for  things  like
that.”

“i know,” i said, “but you would think

he would’ve been back by now.”

time  dragged  slowly  by.  late  in  the
afternoon,  i  saw  papa  coming.  our  old
mule  was
jogging  along.  water  was
shooting  out  from  under  his  feet  in  small

squirts at every step.

papa had tied the halter rope around the
mule’s neck. he was sitting humped over,
with his hands jammed deep in the pockets
of his patched and worn mackinaw. i felt
sorry for him. he was soaking wet, tired,
sleepy, and hungry.

telling mama, “here he is,” i grabbed
my jumper and cap, and ran out to the gate
and waited.

i  was  going  to  ask  him  what  had
happened at the pritchards’ but on seeing
his  tired  face  and  wet  clothes,  i  said,
“papa, you had better go in to the fire. i’ll
take care of the mule, and do the feeding
and milking.”

“that would be fine,” he said.
after doing the chores, i hurried to the
house. i couldn’t wait any longer. i had to

find out what had happened.

walking  into  the  front  room,  i  saw  my
father  had  changed  clothes.  he  was
standing in front of the fireplace, drinking
coffee.

“boy,  that’s  bad  weather,  isn’t  it?”  he

said.

rubin.

i  said  it  was,  and  asked  him  about

“we  went  to  the  old  tree  and  got
rubin’s  body,”  papa  said.  “we  were  on
our way back to the pritchards’ when we
met them. they were just this side of their
place.  they  had  started  to  look  for  him.
rainie  had  been  so  dazed  when  he  got
home, they couldn’t make out what he was
trying  to  tell  them,  but  they  knew  it  must
have been something bad. they wanted to
know what had happened. i did my best to

taking it.

papa  said  he  didn’t  know  as  he  never
did get to see any of the womenfolks. he
said  they  were  the  funniest  bunch  he  had
ever  seen.  he  couldn’t  understand  them.
there  wasn’t  one  tear  shed  that  he  could
see. all  of  the  men  had  stayed  out  at  the
barn. they never had been invited in for a
cup of coffee or anything.

mama  asked  when  they  were  to  have

explain  the  accident.  it  hit  old  man
pritchard pretty hard. i felt sorry for him.”
mama  asked  how  mrs.  pritchard  was

the funeral.

“they  have  their  own  graveyard  right
there on the place,” papa said. “old man
pritchard  said  they  would  take  care  of
everything,  and  didn’t  want  to  bother
people. he said it was too far for anyone

to come, and it was bad weather, too.”

mama  said  she  couldn’t  help  feeling
sorry for mrs. pritchard, and wished they
were more friendly.

i asked papa about rainie.
papa  said,  “according  to  what  old
man  pritchard  said,  rainie  just  couldn’t
seem  to  get  over  the  shock.  they  were
figuring on taking him into town to see the
doctor.”

in  a  stern  voice,  papa  said,  “billy,  i
don’t  want  you  fooling  around  with  the
pritchards  any  more. you  have  plenty  of
country around here so you don’t have to
go there to hunt.”

i said i wouldn’t.
i  felt  bad  about  the  death  of  rubin.  i
didn’t  feel  like  hunting  and  kept  having
bad  dreams.  i  couldn’t  forget  the  way  he

had  looked  at  me  just  before  he  died.  i
moped and wandered around in a daze. i
wanted  to  do  something  but  didn’t  know
what it was.

i  explained  my  feelings  to  my  mother.
she said, “billy, i feel the same way and
would like to do something to help, but i
guess there’s nothing we can do. there are
people  like  the  pritchards  all  through  the
hills.  they  live  in  little  worlds  of  their
own and are all alone. they don’t like to
have outsiders interfere.”

i  told  my  mother  i  had  been  thinking
about how dangerous it was to carry an ax
while hunting, and i had decided i’d save
a few coon hides and get a good gun. boy,
i  just  shouldn’t  have  mentioned  getting  a
gun. my mother got “sitting-hen” mad.

“you’re not getting a gun,” she said. “i

won’t  have  that  at  all.  i  told  you  a  long
time ago you could have one when you are
twenty-one years old, and i mean just that.
i  worry  enough  with  you  out  there  in  the
hills  all  hours  of  the  night,  running  and
jumping,  but  i  couldn’t  stand  it  if  i  knew
you had a gun with you. no, sir. you can
just forget about a gun.”

“yes, mama,” i said, and sulked off to

my room.

lying  on  my  bed,  still  trying  to  figure
out what i could do to help, i glanced over
to the wall. there, tied in a small bundle,
was just what i needed.

some  time  back  my  sisters  had  made
some  flowers  for  decoration  day.  they
had  given  me  a  small  bouquet  for  my
room. taking them down, i could see they
had  faded  a  little,  and  looked  rather  old,

but they were still pretty. i blew the dust
off  and  straightened  the  crinkled  petals.
putting  them  inside  my  shirt,  i  left  the
house.

far  when

i  hadn’t  gone

i  heard
something  behind  me.  it  was  my  dogs.  i
tried to tell them i wasn’t going hunting. i
just had a little business to attend to, and if
they would go back, i’d take them out that
night.  it  was  no  use.  they  couldn’t
understand.

circling around through the flats, i came
to the hollow above the pritchards’ place.
down  below  me,
the
graveyard, and the fresh mound of dirt. as
quietly as i could, i started easing myself
down the mountainside.

i  could  see

old dan loosened a rock. the further it
bounced, the louder it got. it slammed up

against a post oak tree and sounded like a
gunshot. i held my breath and watched the
house. no one came out.

just as we reached the mountaintop, my

i glared at old dan. he wagged his tail,
and  just  to  show  off,  he  sat  down  on  his
rear and started digging at a flea with his
hind leg. the way his leg was thumping in
the leaves, anyone could have heard it for
a  mile.  i  waited  until  he  quit  thumping
before starting on.

reaching the bottom, i had about twenty
yards  of  clearing  to  cross,  but  the  grass
and bushes were pretty thick. laying down
on my stomach, with my heart beating like
a  trip  hammer,  i  wiggled  my  way  to
rubin’s  grave.  i  laid  the  flowers  on  the
fresh  mound  of  earth,  and  then  turned
around and scooted for the timber.

foot  slipped  and  i  kicked  loose  a  large
rock.  down  the  side  of  the  mountain  it
rolled. this time the blue tick hound heard
the  noise.  he  came  out  from  under  the
house  bawling.  i  heard  a  door  slam  and
mrs.  pritchard  came  out.  she  stood
looking this way and that way.

followed  him.  seeing

the hound ran up to the graveyard and
and  bawling.  mrs.
started
the
pritchard
flowers  on  rubin’s  grave,  she  picked
them up and looked at them. she scolded
the  hound,  and  then  looked  up  at  the
hillside.  i  knew  she  couldn’t  see  me
because the timber was too thick, but i felt
uncomfortable anyway.

scolding  the  hound  again,  she  knelt
down  and  arranged  the  flowers  on  the
grave.  taking  one  more  look  at  the

feeling any more.

to  rubin.  everything

hillside, she started back. halfway to the
house,  i  saw  her  reach  down  and  gather
the long cotton skirt in her hand and dab at
her eyes.

all the way home my dogs kept running
out in front of me. they would stop, turn
around, and look at me. i had to smile, for
i  knew  what  they  wanted.  i  stopped  and
petted  them  a  little  and  told  them  that  as
soon as i got home and had my supper, we
would go hunting.

xiv

a  few  days  later,  on  his  way  back  from  the
mill,  one  of  the  hatfield  boys  stopped  at
our  place.  he  told  me  my  grandfather
wanted  to  see  me.  it  was  unusual  for
grandpa  to  send  for  me  and  it  had  me
worried. i figured that he wanted to talk to
me  about  the  death  of  rubin  pritchard.  i
always enjoyed talking to my grandpa but
i didn’t want to talk about rubin’s death.
every  time  i  thought  of  him,  i  lived  the
horrible tragedy all over again.

after  a  practically  sleepless  night,  the
next morning i started for the store. i was
walking along deep in thought when little
ann zipped by me. she was as happy as a

young  gray  squirrel.  she  wiggled  and
twisted  and  once  she  barked  at  me.  i
looked  behind  me.  there  was  old  dan
trotting  along.  he  stopped  when  i  turned
around.  little  ann  came  up  to  me.  i
scolded  them  and  tried  to  explain  that  i
wasn’t going hunting. i was just going up
to  the  store  to  see  what  my  grandpa
wanted. they couldn’t, or didn’t, want to
understand.

i  picked  up  a  small  stick  and  slapped
my  leg  with  it.  in  a  deep  voice  i  said,
“now you go home, or i’m going to wear
you out.”

this hurt their feelings. with their tails
between  their  legs  and  trotting  side  by
side,  they  started  back.  every  little  way
they  would  stop  and  look  back  at  me.  it
was too much. i couldn’t stand it. i began

to feel bad all over.

“well, all right,” i said. “come on, you
can  go,  but,  dan,  if  there  are  any  dogs
around the store, and you get in a fight, i
won’t  take  you  hunting  for  a  whole  year,
and i mean that,” although i knew i didn’t.
they  came  running,  tickled  to  death.
little ann took one of her silly spells. she
started nipping at the long red tail of old
dan.  not  getting  any  reaction  from  him,
she jumped over him. she barked at him.
he  wouldn’t  even  look  at  her.  she  ran
around  in  front  of  him  and  laid  down  in
the trail, acting like a cat ready to spring.
stiff-legged,  he  walked  up  close  to  her,
stopped,  and  showed  his  teeth.  i  laughed
out loud. i knew he wouldn’t bite her any
more than he would bite me. he was just
acting tough because he was a boy dog.

after  several  attempts  to  get  him  to
play,  little  ann  gave  up.  together  they
started sniffing around in the underbrush.

as  i  walked  up  in  front  of  the  store,
grandpa  hollered  at  me  from  the  barn.  i
went  over  to  him.  right  away  he  wanted
to  know  all  about  rubin’s  accident.  he
listened while i told the story over again.
after i had had my say, grandpa stood
looking down at the ground. there was a
deep frown on his face, and a hurt look in
his  eyes.  his  quietness  made  me  feel
uneasy.  he  finally  raised  his  head  and
looked  at  me.  what  i  could  see  in  his
friendly  old  face  tore  at  my  heart.  it
seemed  that  there  were  more  wrinkles
than
i  had  ever  seen  before.  his
uncombed,  iron-gray  hair  looked  almost
white. i noticed that his wrinkled old hand

trembled  as  he  rubbed  the  wire-stiff
stubble on his chin.

in  a  low  voice  that  quivered  as  he
talked, he said, “billy, i’m sorry about all
this. truly sorry. i can’t help but feel that
in a way it was my fault.”

“no, grandpa,” i said, “it wasn’t your
fault.  it  wasn’t  anyone’s  fault.  it  just
happened and no one could help it.”

“i  know,”  he  said,  “but  if  i  hadn’t
called  rubin’s  bet,  nothing  would  have
happened. i guess when a man gets old he
doesn’t think straight. i shouldn’t have let
those boys get under my skin.”

“grandpa,”  i  said,  “rubin  and  rainie
could  get  under  anybody’s  skin.  you
couldn’t  help  that.  why,  they  get  under
everyone’s skin that gets close to them.”

“yes, i know,” he said, “but still i acted

like  a  fool.  billy,  i  had  no  idea  things
were  going  to  turn  out  like  they  did,  or  i
wouldn’t have called that bet.”

wanting  to  change  the  conversation,  i
said, “grandpa, we won that bet fair and
square, but they took my money anyway.”
i  saw  the  fire  come  back  to  his  eyes.
this  made  me  feel  better.  he  was  more
like the grandpa i loved.

“that’s  all  right,”  he  said.  “we’ll  just

forget the whole thing.”

he  stepped  over  and  laid  his  hand  on
my  shoulder.  in  a  solemn  voice,  he  said,
“we  won’t  talk  about  this  again.  now,  i
want  you  to  forget  it  ever  happened
because  it  wasn’t  your  fault.  oh,  i  know
it’s  hard  for  a  boy  to  ever  completely
forget  something  like  that.  all  through
your  life  you’ll  think  of  it  now  and  then,

but  try  not  to  let  it  bother  you,  and  don’t
ever feel guilty about it. it’s not good for a
young boy to feel that way.”

i  nodded  my  head,  thinking  if  people
would  just  stop  questioning  me  about
rubin’s death, maybe i could forget.

grandpa  said,  “well,

the  accident
wasn’t  the  only  thing  i  wanted  to  talk  to
you  about.  i’ve  got  something  else—
something i think will help us both forget a
lot of things.”

the

twinkle

in  grandpa’s

eyes
reminded me of what my father had said:
“seems  like  that  old  man  can  cook  up
more deals than anyone in the country.”

i didn’t care how many deals grandpa
cooked up. he was still the best grandpa
in the whole wide world.

“what have you got?” i asked.

“come over to the store,” he said, “and

i’ll show you.”

on our way over, i heard him mutter, “i
hope  this  doesn’t  turn  out  like  the  ghost-
coon hunt.”

on entering the store, grandpa walked
to  the  post  office  department,  and  came
back  with  a  newspaper  in  his  hand.  he
spread it out on the counter.

pointing  with  his  finger,  he  said  in  a

loud voice, “look, there!”

i  looked.  the  large  black  letters  read:
championship  coon  hunt  to  be  held. my eyes
popped open. again i read the words.

grandpa was chuckling.
i  said,  “boy,  if  that  isn’t  something. a
championship  coon  hunt.”  wide-eyed,  i
asked,  “where  are  they  having  this  hunt,
and what does it have to do with us?”

grandpa was getting excited. off came
his  glasses  and  out  came  the  old  red
handkerchief.  he  blew  his  breath  on  the
lens and polished them. he snorted a time
or  two,  reared  back,  and  almost  shouted,
“do with us? why it has everything to do
with us. all my life i’ve wanted to go to
one  of  these  big  coon  hunts.  why  i’ve
even  dreamed  about  it.  and  now  the
opportunity has come. yes, sir, now i can
go.”  he  paused.  “that  is,  if  it’s  all  right
with you.”

i  was  dumbfounded.  i  said,  “all  right
with me? why, grandpa, you know it’s all
right  with  me,  but  what  have  i  got  to  do
with it?”

grandpa  was  so  excited  i  thought  he

was going to burst a blood vessel.

talking  excitedly,  he  said,  “i’ve  got  it

all fixed, billy. we can enter old dan and
little ann in this championship hunt.”

almost

as

i was so surprised at what grandpa had
said i couldn’t utter a word. at first i was
scared and then a wonderful feeling came
over  me.  i  felt  the  excitement  of  the  big
hunt as it burned its way into my body. i
started  breathing  like  i  had  been  running
for  a  hundred  miles.  after  several
attempts, i croaked, “can just any dog be
in this hunt?”
grandpa

he
answered, “no, sir, not just any hound can
be entered. they have to be the best, and
they have to be registered, too.”

jumped

he  started  talking  with  his  hands.
pointing to a chair, he said, “sit down and
i’ll tell you all about it.”

grandpa  calmed  down  a  little  and

started talking in a serious voice. “billy,”
he said, “it takes some doing to have a set
of  dogs  entered  in  this  hunt.  i’ve  been
working  on  this  for  months.  i’ve  written
letters  on  top  of  letters.  i’ve  even  had
several good friends in town helping me.
you  see,  i’ve  kept  a  record  of  all  the
coons your dogs have caught, and believe
me, their catch is up there with the best of
them. now, i have already paid the entry
fee and everything is fixed. all we have to
do is go.”

“entry  fee?  how  much  did  it  cost?”  i

asked.

“you let me worry about that,” he said.
“now what do you say? want to give it a
whirl? i understand the winner receives a
gold cup, and you never can tell, we might
come  home  with  it.  we  have  as  good  a

chance as anyone else.”

grandpa  had  me  so  worked  up  by  this
time,  i  didn’t  think  anyone  else  had  any
good hounds but me.

i reared back and blurted, “it’s all right
with  me,  grandpa.  just  tell  me  what  to
do.”

grandpa flew out of gear like a model-
t  ford.  he  slapped  the  counter  with  his
hand. in a pent-up voice, he said, “that’s
the  boy!  that’s  the  way  i  like  to  hear  a
coon hunter talk.”

with a questioning look on his face, he
asked,  “didn’t  i  see  your  dogs  with  you
when you came up?”

“yes,

they  followed  me,”  i  said.

“they’re outside.”

something for them.”

“well, call them in,” he said. “i’ve got

i called to them. little ann came in the
store,  walking  like  she  was  scared.  old
dan came to the door and stopped. i tried
to  coax  him  in.  it  was  no  use.  my  dogs,
never  being  allowed  in  the  house,  were
scared to come in.

grandpa  came  back  and  set  little ann
up  on  the  counter.  he  chuckled  as  he
broke  the  cheese  up  in  small  pieces  and
fed her.

grandpa  walked  over  to  a  hoop  of
cheese  and  cut  off  two  chunks  about  the
size  of  my  fist.  he  walked  to  the  door,
talking  to  old  dan.  “what’s  the  matter,
boy?”  he  said.  “you  scared  to  come  in?
well, that shows you’re a good dog.”

he handed him a piece of the cheese. i
heard it rattle in his throat as he gulped it
down.

grandpa  didn’t  have  to  say  that.  the
way i was feeling, i already had the cup.
all i had to do was go and get it.

finished with his feeding of little ann,
grandpa  said,  “now,  let’s  see.  the  hunt
starts  on  the  twenty-third.  that’s  about—
well,  let’s  see—this  is  the  seventeenth.”
counting on his fingers he finally figured
it out. “that’s six days from now,” he said
in a jubilant voice.

“yes, sir,” he said, “i think we have the
best  darn  coon  hounds  in  these  ozark
mountains,  and  just  as  sure  as  shootin’,
we’re going to win that gold cup.”

i nodded my head.
“we  can  leave  here  early  on  the
morning  of  the  twenty-second,”  he  said,
“and  barring  accidents,  we  should  make
the  campground  in  plenty  of  time  for  the

grand opening.”

i asked how we were going.
“we’ll  go  in  my  buggy,”  he  said.  “i’ll
load  the  tent  and  everything  the  night
before.”

i  asked  him  what  he  wanted  me  to

bring.

“nothing,” he said, “but these two little
hounds,  and  you  be  here  early;  and  i
believe i’d let these dogs rest, ‘cause we
want  them  in  tiptop  shape  when  we  get
there.”

i saw the thinking wrinkles bunch up on

grandpa’s forehead.

“you reckon your daddy would like to
go?” he asked. “as late in the fall as it is,
i don’t think he’s too busy, is he?”

“no, our crops are all gathered,” i said.
“we’ve been clearing some of the bottom

land, but that’s almost done now.”

“well, ask him,” he said. “tell him i’d

like to have him go.”

“i’ll  ask  him,”  i  said,  “but  you  know
how  papa  is.  the  farm  comes  first  with
him.”

“i  know,”  grandpa  said,  “but  you  ask
him  anyway,  and  tell  him  what  i  said.
now it’s getting late and you had better be
heading for home.”

i was almost to the door when grandpa

said, “wait a minute.”

he  walked  over  behind  the  candy
counter  and  shook  out  one  of  the  quarter
sacks. he filled it up to the brim, bounced
it on the counter a few times, and dropped
in a few more gumdrops.

with a twinkle in his eye, and a smile
on  his  face,  he  handed  it  to  me  saying,

“save some for your sisters.”

i  was  so  choked  up  i  couldn’t  say
anything.  i  took  it  and  flew  out  the  door,
calling to my dogs.

on  my  way  home  i  didn’t  walk  on  the
ground.  i  was  way  up  in  the  clouds  just
skipping  along.  with  a  song,  i  told  the
sycamore  trees  and  the  popeyed  gray
squirrels how happy i was.

little  ann  sensed  my  happiness.  she
pranced along on the trail. with a doggish
grin on her face, she begged for a piece of
candy, which i so gladly gave.

even  old  dan

the  pleasant
atmosphere.  his  long  red  tail  fanned  the
air. once he raised his head and bawled. i
stood  still  and  listened  to  the  droning
tones  of  his  deep  voice.  the  sound
seemed to be trapped for an instant in the

felt

thick timber. it rolled around under the tall
white sycamores, beat its way through the
wild cane, and found freedom out over the
clear blue waters of the river. the sound,
following  the  river’s  course,  rolled  like
the beat of a jungle drum.

as the echo died away in the distance,
silence settled over the bottoms. the gray
squirrels  stopped  their  chattering.  the
wild birds quit their singing. i stood still.
no  sound  could  be  heard.  it  seemed  that
all the creatures of the wild were holding
their  breath.  i  gazed  up  to  the  towering
heights  of  the  tall  trees.  no  leaf  was
stirring.  the  silence  seemed  strained  and
expectant, like a young boy waiting for a
firecracker to explode.

i  looked  at  old  dan.  he  was  standing
perfectly  still,  with  his  right  front  foot

the silence was broken by the “whee-
e-e-e” of a red-tailed hawk. this seemed
to  be  a  signal. all  around  me  the  happy
atmosphere resumed its natural state.

i  heard  the  “bam,  bam,  bam”  of  a
woodpecker high in the top of a box elder
snag.  the  cry  of  a  kingfisher  and  the
scream  of  a  bluejay  blended  perfectly
with  the  drumlike  beat.  a  barking  red
squirrel, glued to the side of a hackberry
tree, kept time to the music with the beat
of his tail.

raised and his long ears fanned open. he
seemed  to  be  listening,  and  challenging
any living creature to make a noise.

each noise i heard and each sight i saw
was very familiar to me but i never grew
tired of listening and watching. they were
a god-sent gift and i enjoyed them all.

as i skipped along, it was hard for me
to realize all the wonderful things that had
happened to me in such a few short years.
i  had  two  of  the  finest  little  hounds  that
ever bawled on the trail of a ringtail coon.
i  had  a  wonderful  mother  and  father  and
three little sisters. i had the best grandpa a
boy ever had, and to top it all, i was going
on  a  championship  coon  hunt.  it  was  no
wonder  that  my  heart  was  bursting  with
happiness. wasn’t i the luckiest boy in the
world?

everyone  was  just  sitting  down  to
supper  when  i  got  home.  my  sisters  quit
the  table  for  the  candy.  i  told  them  to
divide it equally. the oldest one asked if i
wanted any of it.

“no,” i said. “i brought it all for you.”
of course, i didn’t tell them about the four

pieces i had in my pocket.

they  thanked  me  with  their  clear  blue

eyes.

i guess it’s pretty hard for a young boy
to fool his mama. she took one look at me
and  called  me  over.  she  ruffled  up  my
hair,  kissed  me,  and  said,  “if  my  little
boy’s eyes get any bigger they’re going to
pop  right  out  of  his  head.  now  tell  me,
what are you so happy about?”

before  i  could  say  anything,  papa
chuckled  and  asked,  “what’s  going  on
between you and your grandpa? what are
you and that old man cooking up now?”

as  fast  as  i  could  talk  i  started  telling
about  the  big  coon  hunt.  i  told  how  hard
grandpa  had  been  working  to  have  my
dogs  entered,  and  how  he  had  already
paid my entry fee.

catching my breath and looking at papa,
i said, “we’re going in his buggy and he
wants you to go.”

i  waited  in  silence  for  his  reply.  papa
sat there staring off into space, sipping his
coffee and saying nothing. i knew he was
thinking.

in  the  silence  i  was  sure  i  could  hear

my heart thumping.

i said, “papa, please go. we’ll have a
lot of fun and besides the winner receives
a big golden cup.”

he scratched his head and said, “billy,
i’d sure like to go, but i don’t see how i
can with all this work around here.”

i  was  beginning  to  think  that  papa
wasn’t  going  to  go.  then  mama  started
talking.

“work?”  she  said.  “why,  all  the  work

is  practically  done.  i  don’t  know  of  one
thing you couldn’t put off for a few days.
why  don’t  you  go?  you  haven’t  been
anywhere since i don’t know when.”

“it’s not only the work i’m thinking of,”

papa said. “it’s you and the girls.”

“why,  don’t  worry  about  the  girls  and
me,”  mama  said.  “we’ll  be  all  right.
besides, it’ll be several months yet before
i need any help.”

when mama said this, it dawned on me.
i had been so busy with my coon hunting i
hadn’t  noticed  anything  unusual.  mama’s
tummy was all swelled up. she was going
to have a baby. i felt guilty for not having
noticed.  i  went  over  and  put  my  arms
around her and kissed her.

papa spoke up. “it’s sure going to be a
big  hunt,”  he  said.  “i  heard  something

about it up at the store one day.”

“grandpa  said  there  would  be  hunters
there from everywhere,” i said, “and some
of the best coon hounds in the country.”

“do you think you have a chance to win

the cup?” papa asked.

i  started  to  answer  him  when  the  little
one  piped  up.  “they  can’t  beat  old  dan
and little ann,” she said. “i just bet they
can’t.”

everyone

laughed  at  her

serious
remark.  i  would  have  kissed  her  but  she
had  candy,  corn  bread,  and  molasses  all
over her face.

i  told  papa  i  didn’t  know  how  good
those dogs were, but there was one thing i
did  know.  if  they  beat  mine,  they  would
have  to  hunt  harder  than  they  ever  had
before.

after i had had my say about the dogs, a
silence  settled  over  the  dining  room.
everyone was looking at papa and waiting
for his answer.

i  saw  a  pleased  smile  spread  over  his
face. he stood up. “all right, i’ll go,” he
said, “and, by golly, we’ll bring that gold
cup back, too.”

my sisters started clapping their hands
and  squealing  with  delight.  a  satisfied
smile spread over my mother’s face.

at  that  moment  i’m  sure  no  boy  in  the
world  could  have  been  happier  than  i.
tears  of  happiness  rolled  down  my
cheeks. mama wiped them away with her
apron.

in  the  midst  of  all  the  excitement,  my
little  sister,  saying  not  a  word,  climbed
down  from  her  chair.  no  one  said

anything. we just watched her.

still  clutching  a  spoon  in  her  small
hand,  she  came  around  the  table  and
walked  up  to  me.  looking  down  at  the
floor, in a bashful voice, she asked, “can i
have the gold cup?”

putting my finger under her sticky little
chin,  i  tilted  her  head  up.  i  smiled  as  i
looked  into  her  clear  blue  eyes.  i  said,
“honey, if i win it, i’ll give it to no one
but you.”

i had to cross my heart and hope to die

several times before she was satisfied.

back  in  her  chair  she  gloated  over  the
others. “you just wait and see,” she said.
“it’ll be all mine, nobody’s but mine, and
i’ll put my banty eggs in it.”

“silly,  you  don’t  put  banty  eggs  in  a
gold  cup,”  the  oldest  one  said.  “they’re

just made to look at.”

that  night  i  dreamed  about  gold  cups,
little red hounds, and coons as big as rain
barrels. once i woke myself up whooping
to my dogs.

to  make

the  next  few  days  were  busy  ones  for
me.  knowing  that  papa  and  i  would  be
gone  for  several  days,  i  did  everything  i
could
things  convenient  for
mama. i chopped a large pile of wood and
stacked  it  close  to  the  kitchen  door.  to
make it easy for her to feed our stock, i cut
some poles from the hillside and boxed up
one of the stalls in the barn. i filled it full
of hay so she wouldn’t have to climb the
ladder to the loft.

papa  laid  down  the  law  to  my  sisters
about being good and helping mama while
we were gone.

the day before we were to leave, i was
as  nervous  as  a  june  bug  in  a  henhouse.
the  day  seemed  endless.  a  few  of  the
miserable hours were spent talking to my
dogs. i told them all about the big hunt and
how important it was.

“now if you don’t win the golden cup,”
i  said,  “i  won’t  be  mad  because  i  know
you will do your best.”

old dan wouldn’t even look at me, and
paid  no  attention  to  what  i  said.  he  was
sulking  because  i  hadn’t  been  taking  him
hunting.  when  i  talked  to  little  ann,  it
was different. she listened and seemed to
understand everything i said.

i  dreaded  to  go  to  bed  that  night.  i
thought sleep would be impossible. i must
have been more tired than i thought i was.
i fell asleep almost immediately. old red,

rooster,  woke  me  at  daybreak,

our
crowing his fool head off.

it  was  a  beautiful  morning,  clear  and

frosty.

after  a  good  breakfast,  we  kissed

mama goodbye and started for the store.

i’m  sure  there  were  a  lot  of  coon
hunters in the ozarks, but on that morning
none could have felt as big and important
as  i.  walking  along  by  the  side  of  my
father, i threw out my chest and tried hard
to  keep  pace  with  his  long  strides.  he
noticed and laughed.

“you’ll  have  to  grow  a  little  bit,”  he
said, “before you can take steps that long.”

i didn’t say anything. i just smiled.
hearing a noise overhead, i looked up.
the  gray  ones  were  winging  their  way
southward.  i  listened  to  their  talking  and

wondered what they were saying.

looking  to  the  mountains  around  us,  i
saw that the mysterious artist who comes
at  night  had  paid  us  a  visit.  i  wondered
how  he  could  paint  so  many  different
colors in one night; red, wine, yellow, and
rust.

my dogs were trotting along in front of
us. i smiled at the way their hind quarters
shifted to the right. little ann would jump
and bounce and try to get old dan to play,
but the solemn old boy just jogged along,
heedless of everything.

“you  know,”  papa  said,  “she  doesn’t
even act like a hound. she is bouncing and
playing  all  the  time.  why,  she  acts  more
like a little pup than a hound.”

“yes, i know,” i said. “i’ve noticed that
myself,  but  you  know  one  thing,  papa,

she’s  the  smartest  dog  i’ve  ever  seen.
why,  some  of  the  things  she  does  are
almost unbelievable.”

“yes, i know,” said papa, “but still it’s

strange, very strange.”

“there’s only one thing wrong with her,

papa,” i said.

“yea, what’s that?” he asked.
“you  won’t  believe  it,”  i  said,  “but

she’s gun-shy.”

“gun-shy?  how  do  you  know  she’s

gun-shy?” papa asked.

“i didn’t know for a long time,” i said,
“until  one  day  when  i  was  hoeing  corn
down  in  the  field  by  the  old  slough.  she
and old dan were digging in a bank after
a  ground  hog.  across  the  river  some
fishermen started shooting a gun. it scared
little  ann,  and  she  came  running  to  me,

shaking all over.”

“aw,”  papa  said,  “maybe  you  just

thought she was scared.”

“no,  i  didn’t,  papa,”  i  said.  “it
happened  again  up  at  the  store  one  day.
grandpa  shot  a  chicken  hawk.  when  the
gun  went  off,  it  scared  her  half  to  death.
no, she’s gun-shy all right.”

“aw,  well,”  papa  said,  “that  doesn’t
mean anything. a lot of dogs are afraid of
guns.”

“i  know,”  i  said,  “but  you  wouldn’t
think she would be that way. i believe if i
had a gun of my own i could break her of
being gun-shy.”

papa  looked  at  me.  he  said,  “from
what  your  mother  says,  you  won’t  be
getting a gun for some time yet.”

“yes, i know,” i said.

i  had  never  seen  him  in  such  high
spirits.  he  slapped  papa  on  the  back,
saying, “i’m sure glad you could go with
us. it’ll do you good to get out once in a
while.”

papa laughed and said, “it looked like i
had to go or have everyone in the family
mad at me.”

when we reached the store we saw the
team was already hitched to the buggy and
was standing in front of the store. grandpa
had  loaded  the  tent  and  several  boxes  of
groceries.

looking  in  the  buggy  i  saw  my  ax.  i
didn’t think i ever wanted to see it again,
but  for  some  reason  it  didn’t  look  like  i
thought it would. there was no blood on it
and it looked harmless enough laying there
all clean and bright.

grandpa saw me looking at it. he came

over.

“i kept it a few days,” he said, “just in
case  the  marshal  wanted  to  ask  some
questions. everything seems to be all right
now, and we may need a good ax on this
hunt.”

grandpa sensed how i felt about the ax.

he waited in silence for my answer.

the  excitement  of  the  hunt  was  so
strong  in  me,  even  the  sight  of  the  ax
brought back only a fleeting remembrance
of rubin’s accident.

i  said,  “yes,  we  will  need  one.
besides,  it’s  a  good  one  and  there’s  no
use in throwing it away.”

grandpa  laughed,  reached  over,  and
screwed  my  cap  around  on  my  head,
saying, “that the boy, that’s what i wanted

you to say. now, you better go to the barn
and  get  some  hay  and  make  a  bed  in  the
buggy box for your dogs.”

“aw, grandpa,” i said, “they can walk.
they don’t ever get tired; besides, they’re
used to walking.”

“walk!”  grandpa  almost

shouted.
“they’re not going to walk. no, sir, not if
i can help it. you want them to be footsore
when we get there?”

papa chuckled and said, “we can’t win
a  gold  cup  with  two  sore-footed  hounds,
can we?”

“of  course  not,”  grandpa  said.  “now,

you go and get that hay like i said.”

as i turned to go to the barn i couldn’t
help  but  smile.  it  made  me  feel  good  to
have  my  papa  and  grandpa  so  concerned
about my dogs.

i  had  taken  only  a  few  steps  when

grandpa said, “oh, wait a minute.”

i stopped and turned around.
walking up to me and glancing toward
the house as he did, he whispered, “in that
empty  kraut  barrel  in  the  harness  room,
there’s a jug of corn liquor. cover it up in
the hay so your grandma won’t see it, and
bring it back with you.”

with a twinkle in his eye, he said, “you
never  can  tell  when  we’ll  need  some
medicine.”

i knew my father wouldn’t drink any of
the liquor, but if grandpa wanted to take
along a whole barrel, it was all right with
me.

just  when  i  thought  we  were  ready  to

leave, grandma came bustling out.

grandpa  got  nervous.  he  whispered

and asked, “did you hide the jug good?”

i nodded my head.
grandma  handed  grandpa  a  pair  of
long-handle  underwear  and  a  scarf,
saying, “i knew you’d forget something.”

grandpa snorted but knew there was no

use arguing with her.

in

she  started  picking  around

the
groceries,  asking  about  salt,  pepper,  and
matches.

“nannie,  we’ve  got  everything,”  he
said.  “you  must  think  i’m  a  baby  and
don’t know how to pack a grub box.”

“a  baby,”  grandma  snorted.  “why,
you’re  worse  than  a  baby.  at  least  they
have a little sense. you don’t have any at
all. an old codger like you out chasing a
coon all over the hills.”

at her biting remark, i thought grandpa

was  going  to  blow  up.  he  snorted  like
daisy, our milk cow, when she had seen a
booger.

i crawled up in the buggy box with my

on our way.

dogs and hung my feet out.

grandma  came  over  and  asked  me
about  warm  clothes.  i  told  her  i  had
plenty.

she  kissed  me  good-bye  and  we  were

xv

over  a  dim  rocky  road,  in  a  northeasterly
direction, our buggy moved on.

i noticed that the road stayed at the edge
of the foothills, but always in sight of the
river.

about  the  middle  of  the  afternoon  we
stopped  at  a  small  stream  to  water  the
team. papa asked grandpa if he intended
to go all the way to the campground before
stopping.

“no,” he said, “i figure to put up for the
night  when  we  reach  bluebird  creek.
with a good early start in the morning we
can  make  the  campgrounds  in  plenty  of
time to pitch our tent and set up camp.”

late that evening we reached bluebird
creek.  we  didn’t  set  up  our  tent.  with  a
tarp we made a lean- to and built a large
fire out in front of it.

while  grandpa  fed  and  watered  the
team,  papa  and  i  carried  our  bedding  to
the shelter and made down our beds.

grandpa  said,  “while  we’re  cooking
supper,  you  see  to  your  dogs.  feed  them
and fix them a warm bed.”

“i figure to cook them some corn-meal
mush,” i said. “that’s what they’re used to
eating.”

“mush!”  grandpa  growled.  “they’re
not  going  to  have  mush,  not  if  i  can  help
it.”

he  walked  over  to  a  grocery  box,
mumbling as he did, “mush! a hound can’t
hunt on a bellyful of that stuff.”

he came back and handed me two large
cans  of  corned-beef  hash,  saying,  “here.
reckon they’ll eat this.”

i wanted to hug my old grandpa’s neck.
“sure,  grandpa,”  i  said,  “they’ll  love
that.”

opening one of the cans, i dumped it out
on a piece of bark in front of old dan. he
sniffed at it and refused to eat. i laughed,
for i knew why. while i was opening the
other can, grandpa came over.

“what’s  the  matter,”  he  asked.  “won’t

he eat it?”

“sure, grandpa,” i said, “he’ll eat, but

not before little ann gets her share.”

with  the  second  can  opened,  i  fed  her
on  another  piece  of  bark.  both  of  them
started eating at the same time.

with  an  astonished  look  on  his  face,

grandpa exclaimed, “well, i’ll be darned.
i  never  saw  anything  like  that.  why,  i
never saw a hound that wouldn’t eat. did
you train them to do that?”

“no,  grandpa,”

i  said.  “they’ve
always  been  that  way.  they  won’t  take
anything  away  from  each  other,  and
everything they do, they do it as one.”

papa  had  overheard  our  conversation.
he  said,  “you  think  that’s  strange.  you
should have seen what i saw one day.

“one  of  the  girls  threw  two  cold
biscuits out in the back yard to old dan.
he  stood  and  looked  at  them  for  a  bit,
then, picking both of them up in his mouth,
he  trotted  around  the  house.  i  followed
just  to  see  what  he  was  going  to  do.  he
walked  up  in  front  of  the  doghouse,  laid
them down, and growled; not like he was

mad.  it  was  a  strange  kind  of  a  growl.
little ann  came  out  of  the  doghouse  and
each of them ate a biscuit. now, i saw this
with my own eyes. believe me, those dogs
are close to each other—real close.”

after papa had stopped talking, silence

settled over the camp.

grandpa stood staring at my dogs. in a
slow  voice,  as  if  he  were  picking  his
words,  he  said,  “you  know,  i’ve  always
felt like there was something strange about
those  dogs.  i  don’t  know  just  what  it  is,
and i can’t exactly put my finger on it, yet i
can feel it. maybe it’s just my imagination.
i don’t rightly know.”

turning to my father, he said, “did you
ever notice the way they watch this boy?
they see every move he makes.”

papa  said,  “yes,  i’ve  noticed  a  lot  of

things they have done. in fact, i could tell
you  of  a  few  that  you  would  never
believe,  but  right  now  here’s  something
you had better believe. supper is ready.”

while  i  was  helping  myself  to  hot
dutch-oven corn bread, fried potatoes, and
fresh  side  meat,  grandpa  poured  the
coffee. instead of the two cups i expected
to see, he set out three and filled them to
the brim with the strong black liquid.

i  had  never  been  allowed  to  drink
coffee  at  home  and  didn’t  exactly  know
what to do. i glanced at papa. he seemed
too  busy  with  his  eating  to  pay  any
attention  to  me.  taking  the  bull  by  the
horns,  i  reached  over  and  ran  my  finger
through the cup’s handle. i held my breath
as i walked over and sat down by a post
oak  stump.  nothing  was  said.  grandpa

and papa paid no attention to what i did.
my head swelled up as big as a number-
four washtub. i thought, “i’m not only big
enough  to  help  papa  with  the  farm.  now
i’m big enough to drink coffee.”

with  supper  over  and

the  dishes
washed,  grandpa  said,  “well,  we  had
better turn in as i want to get an early start
in the morning.”

long after grandpa and papa had fallen
asleep,  i  lay  thinking  of  the  big  hunt.  my
thoughts  were
the
wonders  of  night  life  began  to  stir  in  the
silence around us.

interrupted  when

from  a  ridge  on  our  right  a  red  fox
started barking. he was curious and, in his
small  way,  challenging  the  intruders  that
had  dared  to  stop  in  his  wild  domain.
from  far  back  in  the  flinty  hills,  the

monotonous  call  of  a  hoot  owl  floated
down in the silent night. it was the mating
call  and  was  answered  from  a  distant
mountain.

i  could  hear  the  stamping  feet  of  our
horses,  and  the  grinding,  crunching  noise
made by their strong teeth as they ate the
hard, yellow kernels of corn in their feed
boxes.  a  night  hawk  screamed  as  he
winged  his  way  through  the  starlit  night.
an  eerie  screech  from  a  tree  close  by
made shivers run up and down my spine. it
was a screech owl.

i didn’t like to hear the small owl, for
there  was  a  superstition  in  the  mountains
concerning  them.  it  was  said  that  if  you
heard one owl it meant nothing at all, but
if  you  heard  more  than  one,  it  meant  bad
luck.

i lay and listened to the eerie twittering
sound. it was coming from the left of our
camp.  the  creepy  noise  stopped,  and  for
several moments there was silence. when
next  i  heard  the  cry,  it  was  coming  from
the  right.  i  sat  up  in  alarm.  had  i  heard
two owls?

my movement had awakened grandpa.
in  a  sleepy  voice,  he  asked,  “what’s  the
matter?  can’t  you  sleep?  what  are  you
sitting up like that for?”

“grandpa, i heard two screech owls,” i

said.

grunting  and  mumbling,  he  sat  up.
rubbing the sleep from his eyes, he said,
“you heard two screech owls. why, that’s
nothing. i’ve heard two—oh, i see. you’re
thinking  of
the  bad-luck  superstition.
there’s  nothing  to  that;  nothing  at  all.

now  you  lie  down  and  go  to  sleep.
tomorrow is going to be a big day.”

i tried hard to fall asleep, but couldn’t. i
couldn’t get the owls out of my mind. had
i  really  heard  two?  were  we  going  to
have  bad  luck?  surely  nothing  bad  could
happen. not on such a wonderful hunt.

i  found  peace  in  my  mind  by  telling
myself  that  the  owl  had  changed  trees.
yes, that was it. he had simply flown out
of one tree to another.

the  next  morning,  while  having
breakfast,  grandpa  started  kidding  me
about the screech owls.

“i  wish  you  could  have  caught  one  of
those owls last night,” he said. “we could
have  boiled  him  in  our  coffee  pot.  i’ve
heard there is nothing like strong hoot-owl
coffee.”

“it wasn’t a hoot owl, grandpa,” i said.
“it  was  a  screech  owl.  i  don’t  know  for
sure  if  i  heard  one  or  two.  it  could  have
been  just  one.”  pointing  to  a  small  red
oak, i said, “i think the first time i heard
him, he was over there. the next time, it
was  over  in  that  direction.  maybe  he
changed trees. i sure hope so.”

grandpa  saw  i  was  bothered.  “you
don’t  believe  that  hogwash  superstition,
do you? bad luck! baw, there’s nothing to
it.”

the encouraging words from papa and
grandpa helped some, but there was still
some  doubt.  it’s  hard  for  a  young  boy  to
completely forget things like that.

papa

laughed,  and

said,  “these
mountains  are  full  of  that  jinx  stuff.  if  a
man believed it all, he’d go crazy.”

breakfast  over,  and  our  gear  stowed
back in the buggy, we left bluebird creek.
on  that  day  grandpa  drove  a  little
faster  than  he  had  on  the  previous  one.  i
was  glad  of  this,  for  i  was  anxious  to
reach the campground.

about noon he stopped the team. i heard
this  black  fox

him  ask  papa,  “is
hollow?”

“no,”  papa  said.  “this  is  waterfall.

black fox is the next one over. why?”

said,

“well,”  grandpa

“there’s
supposed to be a white flag in the mouth
of black fox. that’s where we leave the
road. the camp is in the river bottoms.”

by this time i was so excited, i stood up
in  the  buggy  box  so  i  could  get  a  better
view.

“maybe  you  ought  to  step  them  up  a

little, grandpa,” i said. “it’s getting pretty
late.”

papa  joined  in  with  his  loud  laughter.
“you just take it easy,” he said. “we’ll get
there  in  plenty  of  time.  besides,  these
mares can’t fly.”

i  saw  the  flag  first.  “there  it  is,

grandpa,” i shouted.

“where?” he asked.
“over

there.  see,

grapevine.”

tied  on

that

as we left the main road, i heard papa
say,  “boy,  look  at  all  those  tracks.  sure
has been a lot of traveling on this road.”

“that smoke over there must be coming

from the camps,” grandpa said.

when  we  came  in  sight  of  the  camp,  i
couldn’t  believe  what  i  saw.  i  stared  in
amazement.  i  had  never  seen  so  many

people  at  one  gathering.  tents  were
spread  out  over  an  acre  and  a  half  of
ground;  all  colors,  shapes,  and  sizes.
there  were  odd-looking  cars,  buggies,
wagons, and saddle horses.

i  heard  grandpa  say  almost

in  a
whisper, “i knew there would be a lot of
people  here  but  i  never  expected  so
many.”

i saw the astonished look on my father’s

face.

off  to  one  side  of  the  camp,  under  a
large black gum tree, we set up our tent. i
tied my dogs to the buggy, and fixed a nice
bed  for  them  under  it.  after  everything
was taken care of, i asked if i could look
around the camp.

“sure,”  grandpa  said.  “go  any  place
you want to go, only don’t get in anyone’s

know it would have burst.

i walked on, as straight as a canebrake

cane.

way.”

i  started  walking  through  the  large
camp.  everyone  was  friendly.  once  i
heard  a  voice  say,  “that’s  the  boy  who
owns the two little red hounds. i’ve heard
they’re pretty good.”

if  my  head  had  gotten  any  bigger,  i

i looked at the hounds. they were tied
in  pairs  here  and  there.  i  had  seen  many
coon  hounds  but  none  that  could  equal
these.  there  were  redbones,  blue  ticks,
walkers, and blood hounds. i marveled at
their  beauty.  all  were  spotlessly  clean
with  slick  and  glossy  coats.  i  saw  the
beautiful
leashes  and  brass-
studded collars.

leather

i  thought  of  my  dogs.  they  were  tied
with  small  cotton  ropes,  and  had  collars
made from old checkline leather.

as  i  passed  from  one  set  of  dogs  to
another,  i  couldn’t  help  but  wonder  if  i
had  a  chance  to  win.  i  knew  that  in  the
veins of these hounds flowed the purest of
breeded  blood.  no  finer  coon  hounds
could be found anywhere. they came from
the  smoky  mountains  of  tennessee,  the
bayou country of louisiana, the red river
bottoms of texas, and the flinty hills of the
ozarks.

walking back through the camp, i could
feel  the  cold  fingers  of  doubt  squeezing
my  heart.  one  look  at  my  dogs  drove  all
doubt  away.  in  the  eyes  of  little  ann  it
seemed i could read this message: “don’t
worry. just wait. we’ll show them.”

that  night,  grandpa  said,  “tomorrow
they’ll have a contest for the best-looking
hound. which one are you going to enter?”
i told him i didn’t think i’d enter either
one  of  my  dogs.  they  were  so  little.  i
didn’t think they had a chance.

grandpa got all huffed up. he said, “it
doesn’t  make  any  difference  how  little
they  are.  they’re  coon  hounds,  aren’t
they?”

i  asked  him  if  he  had  seen  any  of  the

other hounds.

he said, “yes, i’ve seen them all. sure
they’re  big  and  good  dogs,  too,  but  it
makes  no  difference.  i  don’t  care  if  your
dogs are no bigger than a snuff can. they
still  have  a  chance.  now,  which  one  are
you going to enter?”

i  couldn’t  decide.  i  said,  “i’ll  think  it

over tonight and let you know tomorrow.”
the  next  morning  when  i  stepped
outside  the  tent  i  saw  men  everywhere.
they  were  combing  and  brushing  their
dogs,  and  getting  them  pruned  for  the
beauty  contest.  beautiful  combs  and
brushes were used to brush expensive oils
into their glossy hair.

going  over  to  my  dogs,  i  stood  and
looked at them. i started to untie old dan
but,  taking  a  closer  look  at  him,  i  could
see  he  could  never  win  a  beauty  contest.
his  face  and  ears  were  a  mass  of  old
scars,  caused  from  the  many  fights  with
tough  old  coons  and  bobcats.  i  held  his
head  in  my  hands  and  felt  sorry  for  him,
but loved him that much more.

i  looked  little  ann  over  and  couldn’t
see  any  scars.  i  laughed  because  i  knew

why. she was too smart to walk right up in
the  face  of  a  fight.  she  would  wait  until
old dan took hold and then dart in.

i  untied  her  rope  and  walked  her  over

to our tent.

my  father  and  grandfather  were  gone.
no  doubt  they  were  over  in  some  tent
visiting old friends and making new ones.
looking  around  to  find  something  i
could  use  to  groom  my  dog,  i  saw
grandpa’s  open  suitcase.  there,  right  on
top,  was  the  very  thing  i  needed,  his
beautiful  bone-handled  hairbrush  and  his
ivory  comb.  picking  them  up,  i  turned
them over and over in my hand.

little  ann  stood

looking  at  me.
impulsively i reached down and raked her
from  shoulder  to  hip  with  the  brush.  she
seemed to like it. i knew i shouldn’t do it,

but i decided to use them.

knowing i had no oils, i got some butter
from our grocery box. with the homemade
butter  and  grandpa’s  hair  set,  i  brushed
her  until  she  shone.  all  the  time  i  was
grooming  her,  she  tried  to  lick  the  butter
from my hands.

the job completed, i stepped back and
inspected  her.  i  was  surprised  at  the
change.  her  short  red  hair  glistened  and
every one was in perfect place.

shaking my finger at her, i said, “if you
lay  down  and  roll,  i’ll  wear  you  out,”
although i knew i wouldn’t.

hearing  a  lot  of  movement  outside,  i
looked out. men were setting their dogs on
a  long  table  which  had  been  built  in  the
center  of  the  campground.  leading  little
ann  to  it,  i  picked  her  up  and  set  her  on

the table, too.

i told her to act like a lady. she wagged
her tail as though she understood. i untied
the rope and stepped back.

i couldn’t speak. i just nodded my head.

after  the  dogs  were  all  lined  up,  the
judging  started.  four
judges  walked
around  and  around  the  table,  looking  at
them  from  all  angles.  when  one  of  them
would  point  at  a  hound,  he  was  taken
down  and  eliminated  from  the  contest.
dog after dog was disqualified. little ann
was still on the table.

my eyes were wide, my throat dry, and
my  heart  thumping.  one  judge  stopped  in
front of little ann. my heart stopped, too.
reaching over, he patted her on the head.
turning  to  me,  he  asked,  “is  this  your

dog?”

he said, “she’s a beautiful hound.”
he walked on down the line. my heart

started beating again.

there  were  eight  dogs  left.  little ann
was  still  holding  her  own.  then  there
were four. i was ready to cry. two more
were  taken  down.  little  ann  and  a  big
walker hound owned by a mr. kyle were
the  only  ones  left.  the  judges  couldn’t
seem to make up their minds.

everyone started shouting, “walk them!

walk them!”

i didn’t know what they meant.
mr. kyle and i were told to go to one
end of the table. our dogs were placed at
the  other  end.  mr.  kyle  snapped  his
fingers and called to his dog.

the  big  hound  started  walking  toward
his master. what a beautiful sight it was.

he walked like a king. his body was stiff
and  straight,  his  head  high  in  the  air,  his
large  muscles  quivered  and  jerked  under
his  glossy  coat,  but  something  went
wrong. just before he reached the end, he
broke his stride, turned, and jumped down
from the table.

a low murmur ran through the crowd.
it  was  my  turn.  three  times  i  tried  to
call  to  little  ann.  words  just  wouldn’t
come  out.  my  throat  was  too  dry.  the
vocal  cords  refused  to  work,  but  i  could
snap  my  fingers.  that  was  all  i  needed.
she  started  toward  me.  i  held  my  breath.
there was silence all around me.

as graceful as any queen, with her head
high in the air, and her long red tail arched
in a perfect rainbow, my little dog walked
down the table. with her warm gray eyes

during  the  commotion  i  felt  hands
slapping  me  on  the  back,  and  heard  the
word  “congratulations”  time  after  time.
the  head  judge  came  over  and  made  a
speech. handing me a small silver cup, he
said,  “congratulations,  son.  it  was  justly
won.”

the  tears  came  rolling.  i  gathered  my
dog up in my arms and walked to our tent.
grandpa  followed,  proudly  carrying  the
cup.

staring  straight  at  me,  on  she  came.
walking up to me, she laid her head on my
shoulder. as i put my arms around her, the
crowd exploded.

that evening the head judge stepped up
on  the  table.  he  had  a  small  box  in  his
hand. he shouted, “over here, men! i have
some announcements to make.”

we all gathered around.
in  a  loud  voice,  he  said,  “gentlemen,
the contest will start tonight. i’m sure most
of  you  men  have  been  in  these  hunts
before.  for  those  of  you  who  haven’t,  i
will explain the rules. each night five sets
of dogs will be taken out to hunt. a judge
will  go  along  with  each  pair  of  hounds.
every morning, the judges will turn in that
night’s catch. the two hounds that tree the
most
the
championship  runoff.  the  other  four  sets
will  be  eliminated  from  the  hunt.  of
course,  if  there  is  a  tie,  both  sets  will
qualify.  on  the  following  nights,  only
those  hounds  tying  the  first  night’s  score,
or getting more, will be in the runoff.

coons  will  qualify

for

“now,  gentlemen,  this  hunt  must  be
carried out in a sportsmanlike way. if the

“you  are  allowed  to  take  an  ax,  a
lantern,  and  a  gun  with  bird  shot,  which
you can use to get a coon out of a tree.

“twenty-five sets of hounds have been
entered  in  the  hunt.  in  this  box,  i  have
twenty-five cards. everyone in the contest
will  now  line  up  for  the  drawing.  the
card  you  draw  will  tell  you  what  night
your hounds are to hunt.”

coon  is  treed  where  he  can’t  be  caught,
such as in a bluff, it will not be counted.
you must catch the coon, skin it, and turn
the hide over to your judge.

walking along in the line, i noticed the
beautiful red coats, the caps, and the soft
leather boots worn by the other hunters. i
felt out of place in my faded blue overalls,
old sheepskin coat, and scuffed and worn
shoes, but to the wonderful men it made no

difference.  they  treated  me  like  a  man,
and even talked to me like a man.

when it came my time to draw, my hand
was shaking so hard i could hardly get it
in  the  box.  pulling  the  card  out,  i  saw  i
had drawn the fourth night.

after  the  hunters  had  left,  we  stood
around our campfires sipping strong black
coffee  and  listening  to  the  baying  of  the
hounds. time after time, we heard the tree
bark.

once  two  hounds  came  close  to  the
camp, hot on a trail. we listened to their
steady bawling. all at once they stopped.
after  several  minutes  of  waiting,  a
hunter  said,  “you  know  what?  that  old
coon  took  to  the  river  and  in  some  way
has fooled those dogs.”

another  one  said,  “yes,  sir,  he  sure

has.”

a  friendly  hunter  looked  at  me  and
asked, “do you think he could have fooled
your dogs?”

thinking his question over, i said, “you
know, sometimes when i am hunting, away
back  in  the  mountains  or  down  on  the
river, i sing a little song i made up myself.
one of the verses goes like this:

you  can  swim  the  river,
old mister ringtail,
and  play  your  tricks  out
one by one.
it  won’t  do  any  good,  old
mister ringtail,
my little ann knows every
one.

the hunters roared with laughter. some

slapped me on the back.

that’s all.”

tired  and  sleepy,  but  with  a  smile  on

my face, i went off to bed.

the next morning two blue tick hounds,
from  the  smoky  mountains  of  tennessee,
came out in the lead with three big coons
to  their  credit.  the  other  four  sets  were
eliminated.

the  following  morning  all  five  sets  of
dogs were eliminated. none had even tied
the blue ticks, although two sets had gotten
two  coons,  and  one  of  these  had  treed  a
third one in a bluff.

that  day,  while  eating  dinner,  my
grandfather asked me if my dogs had ever
treed three coons in one night.

i  said,  “yes,  four  different  times,  but

our night?” papa asked.

i told him if we could get our judge to
go  with  us  in  the  buggy,  we  would  be
better  off  if  we  could  go  far  downriver
and get out of the range where other dogs
had hunted.

he said, “that’s a good idea. i’ll go to

see the judges about it.”

“where do you think we should hunt on

while  i  was  washing

the  dishes,

grandpa said, “i think i’ll shave.”

i  should’ve  left  the  tent  then,  but  i

wasn’t done with my dish-washing.

with  a  pin,  grandpa  hung  a  small
mirror  on  the  tent  wall.  after  much
snorting,  mumbling,  and  screwing  of  his
face  this  way  and  that,  the  job  was
completed.  dabbing  a  little  water  on  his
iron-gray  hair,  he  reached  for  his  brush

and comb.

from  the  corner  of  my  eye  i  watched
him.  i  had  tried  to  clean  the  beautiful
brush  but  hadn’t  been  able  to  get  all  the
short red hair from it.

with two fingers, grandpa pulled some
of the hair from the bristles. holding it in
front  of  him,  he  looked  it  over  carefully.
then,  bending  over  close  to  the  mirror,
peeking over his glasses, he inspected his
head.  straightening  up,  he  looked  at  the
brush  again.  turning  around  quickly,  he
looked  straight  at  me  and  said,  “say,
young—”

not  waiting  for  anything  more,  i
scooted  for  the  door.  crawling  under  the
buggy,  i  lay  down  between  my  dogs.  i
knew  he  wouldn’t  be  mad  at  me,  but  it
would be best to stay away for a while.

all  that  day  i  was  restless.  i  prowled
through  the  camp.  every  little  while  i
would go and see how old dan and little
ann were. once i took two weenies from
our groceries. i heated them and gave them
to  my  dogs
treat.  old  dan
swallowed  his  down  in  one  gulp,  and
looked  at  me  as  if  to  say,  “is  that  all?”
little  ann  ate  hers  in  a  ladylike  way.  i
could  have  sworn  i  saw  a  small  grin  on
her face.

for  a

the third night, the blue ticks were tied
by  two  black  and  tan  hounds  from  the
bayou country of louisiana.

grandpa  was  hopping  around  like  a
grasshopper,  going  here  and  there.  once,
passing a tent, i heard his voice. i knew he
was  bragging  about  my  dogs.  i  smiled  to
myself.

another  hunter  stopped  me  and  asked,
“is it true that your hounds have treed six
coons in one night, three up in one tree, or
is that old man just blowing off steam?”

i  told  him  my  grandfather  had  a  little
steam, but he was the best grandpa a boy
ever had.

he  patted  me  on  the  head,  turned,  and

walked away laughing.

xvi

in  the  afternoon  our  judge  came  over  and
introduced  himself.  he  told  us  he’d  be
going with us that night.

about  sundown  we  piled  in  our  buggy
and  drove  a  few  miles  downriver.  i
noticed other hunters doing the same thing.
everyone was trying to get away from the
already-hunted territory.

it  was  dark  by  the  time  grandpa
stopped. i untied the ropes from my dogs.
little ann  reared  up  on  me  and  whined.
old dan walked off a few yards, stretched
his  body,  and  dragged  his  claws  through
the soft bottom soil. opening his mouth, he
let  out  one
then

loud  bawl,  and

disappeared in the thick timber. little ann
was right on his heels.

we took off after them.
grandpa  got  nervous.  he  said  to  me,
“don’t  you  think  you  ought  to  whoop  to
them?”

i told him to wait a little while. there

would be plenty of time for whooping.

he snorted and said he thought a hunter

always whooped to his dogs.

“i do, grandpa,” i said, “but not before

they strike a trail.”

we walked on. every now and then we
would  stop  and  listen.  i  could  hear  the
loud snuffing of old dan. once we caught
a  glimpse  of  little  ann  as  she  darted
across  an  opening  that  was  bathed  in
moonlight.  she  was  as  silent  as  a  ghost
and as quick as a flitting shadow.

papa  said,  “it  sure  is  a  beautiful  night

for hunting.”

the  judge  said,  “you  can’t  beat  these
ozark mountain nights for beauty. i don’t
care where you go.”

grandpa  started  to  say  something.  his
voice  was  drowned  out  by  the  bell-like
cry of little ann.

in  a  whisper,  i  said,  “come  on,  dan.

hurry and help her.”

as if in answer to my words, his deep
voice  hammered  its  way  up  through  the
river  bottoms.  i  felt  the  blood  tingling  in
my veins. that wonderful feeling that only
a hunter knows crept over my body.

looking over at grandpa, i said, “now

you can whoop.”

jerking  off  his  hat  and  throwing  back
his  head,  he  let  out  a  yell.  it  wasn’t  a

whoop, or a screech, it was about halfway
in between. everyone laughed.

the  coon  was  running  upriver  toward
our campground. we turned and followed.
i  could  tell  by  the  dogs’  voices  that  they
were  running  side  by  side,  and  were  hot
on  the  trail.  closing  my  eyes,  i  could
almost see them running, bodies stretched
to  their  fullest  length,  legs  pounding  up
and down, white steam rolling from their
hot breath in the frosty night.

tangled  up

lost  his  hat

grandpa  got
and

in  some
and
underbrush,
spectacles.  it  took  us  a  while  to  find  the
glasses. papa said something about getting
them wired on with bailing wire. grandpa
snorted. the judge laughed.

the  coon  crossed  the  river  and  ran  on
upstream.  soon  my  dogs  were  out  of

hearing distance. i told papa we had better
stay  on  our  side  of  the  river  and  keep
going until we could hear them again.

twenty  minutes  later  we  heard  them

coming back. we stopped.

“i  think  they  have  crossed  back  to  our

side,” i said.

all at once the voices of my dogs were

drowned out by a loud roar.

“what in the world was that?” grandpa

said.

“i don’t know,” the judge said. “reckon

it was wind or thunder?”

about that time we heard it again.
the  judge  started  laughing.  “i  know
now  what  it  is,”  he  said.  “those  hounds
have run that coon right back by our camp.
the noise we heard was the other hunters
whooping to them.”

everyone laughed.
a  few  minutes  later  i  heard  my  dogs
bawling treed. on reaching the tree, papa
ran  his  hand  back  under  his  coat.  he
pulled out grandpa’s gun.

“that’s a funny-looking gun,” the judge

said. “it’s a 410-gauge pistol, isn’t it?”

“it’s  the  very  thing  for  this  kind  of
work,”  papa  said.  “you  couldn’t  kill  a
coon  with  it  if  you  tried,  especially  if
you’re  using  bird  shot.  all  it  will  do  is
sting his hide a little.”

at the crack of the gun, the coon gave a
loud squall and jumped. my dogs lost no
time in killing him.

we skinned the coon, and soon were on

our way again.

the next time my dogs treed, they were
across the river from us. finding a riffle,

we  pulled  off  our  shoes  and  started
across.

grandpa  very  gingerly  started  picking
his  way.  his  tender  old  feet  moved  from
one  smooth  rock  to  another.  everything
was  fine  until  we  reached  midstream,
where  the  current  was  much  swifter.  he
stepped  on  a  loose  round  rock.  it  rolled
and down he went.

as  the  cold  river  water  touched  his
body, he let out a yell that could have been
heard  for  miles.  he  looked  so  funny  we
couldn’t keep from laughing.

papa  and  the  judge  helped  him  to  his
feet.  laughing  every  step  of  the  way,  we
finally  reached  the  other  side.  grandpa
kept  going  in  his  wet  clothes  until  we
reached the tree where the dogs were.

after killing the coon, we built a large

fire  so  grandpa  could  dry  his  clothes.
he’d  get  up  as  close  to  the  fire  as  he
could,  and  turn  this  way  and  that.  he
looked  so  funny  standing  there  with  his
long underwear steaming. i started rolling
with laughter.

he  looked  over  at  me  and  snapped,

“what’s so funny?”
i said, “nothing.”
“well, why are you laughing?” he said.
at  this  remark,  papa  and  the  judge

laughed until their eyes watered.

mumbling  and  grumbling,  grandpa
said, “if you fellows were as cold as i am,
you wouldn’t be laughing.”

we knew we shouldn’t be laughing, but

we couldn’t help ourselves.

the  judge  looked  at  his  watch.  “it’s
after  three  o’clock,”  he  said.  “do  you

think they’ll tree another one?”

as  if  to  throw  the  words  back  in  the
judge’s face, old dan opened up. i stood
up  and  whooped.  “whoo-e-e!  get  him,
dan! get him! put him up a little tree.”

there  was  a  mad  scramble.  grandpa
tried  to  put  his  britches  on  backwards.
the judge and papa ran over to help him
with  his  shoes.  each  one  tried  to  put  a
shoe on the wrong foot. i was laughing so
hard i could do nothing.

a  hundred  yards  from

the  fire,  i
realized we had forgotten the coonskins. i
ran back for them.

my  dogs  had  jumped  the  coon  in
swampland.  he  tore  out  for  the  river
bottoms.  i  could  tell  they  were  close  to
him by their fast bawling. all at once their
baying  stopped.  we  stood  still  and

listened.  old  dan  bawled  treed  a  few
more times and then stopped.

grandpa asked, “what’s happened?”
i told him the coon had probably pulled

some kind of trick.

coming  up  to  my  dogs,  we  saw  they
were  working  up  and  down  an  old  rail
fence. we stood and watched. every now
and  then,  old  dan  would  rear  up  on  a
large  hackberry  tree  that  was  standing
about seven feet from the fence and bawl
treed.

as  yet  little  ann  had  not  bawled  the
tree  bark.  we  watched  her.  she  was
working  everywhere.  she  climbed  up  on
the  rail  fence  and  followed  its  zigzag
course  until  she  disappeared
the
darkness.

in

i  told  papa  i  was  sure  the  coon  had

walked the rail fence and in some way had
fooled my dogs.

old dan would keep coming back to the
hackberry tree. he would rear up on it and
bawl
to  him.
looking  the  tree  over,  we  could  see  that
the coon wasn’t in it.

treed.  we  walked  up

the  judge  said,  “it  looks  like  he  has

them fooled.”

“maybe  you  had  better  call  them  off,”
grandpa said. “we can go someplace else
and hunt. we’ve got to get one more coon,
even if i have to tree it myself.”

for some reason, no one laughed at his

remark.

“it’s almost daylight,” papa said.
“yes,  that’s  what  has  me  worried,”  i
said. “we don’t have time to do any more
hunting. if we lose this one, we’re beat.”

“i  don’t  know  for  sure,”  i  said.  “he
walked that rail fence. the hackberry tree
has  something  to  do  with  his  trick,  but  i
don’t know what.”

“son,” the judge said, “i wouldn’t feel
too badly if i were you. i’ve seen some of
the very best hounds fooled by a smart old
coon.”

hearing the word beat, grandpa began
to  fidget.  he  asked  me,  “what  do  you
think  happened?  how  did  that  coon  fool
them?”

regardless of all the discouraging talk,
the  love  and  belief  i  had  in  my  little  red
hounds  never  faltered.  i  could  see  them
now  and  then,  leaping  over  old  logs,
tearing  through  the  underbrush,  sniffing
and  searching  for  the  lost  trail.  my  heart
swelled  with  pride.  i  whooped,  urging

them on.

in a low voice, the judge said, “i’ll say

one thing. they don’t give up easily.”

birds began to chirp all around us. the
sky  took  on  a  light  gray  color.  tiny  dim
stars were blinking the night away.

“it  looks  like  we’re  beat,”  papa  said.

“it’s getting daylight.”

at that moment, the loud clear voice of
a  redbone  hound,  bawling  treed,  rang
through the river bottoms. it was the voice
of little ann.

sucking in a mouthful of air, i held it. i
could  feel  my  heart  pounding  against  my
ribs. i closed my eyes tight and gritted my
teeth to keep the tears from coming.
“let’s go to them,” grandpa said.
“no, wait a minute,” i said.
“why?” he asked.

“wait  till  old  dan  gets  there,”  i  said.
“it’s  daylight  now,  and  if  we  walk  up  to
the tree, the coon will jump out. it’s hard
to  keep  a  coon  in  a  tree  after  daylight.
let’s wait until old dan gets there. then
if he jumps, he won’t have a chance to get
away.”

“the boy’s right,” the judge said. “it’s
hard  to  keep  a  coon  in  a  tree  after
daybreak.”

just  then  we  heard  old  dan.  his  deep
voice  shattered
the  morning  silence.
searching for the lost trail, he had crossed
the fence and worked his way out into an
old  field.  turning  around,  we  saw  him
coming.  he  was  a  red  blur  in  the  gray
morning  shadows.  coming  to  the  rail
fence, and without breaking his stride, he
raised  his  body
the  air.  about

into

halfway over and while still in the air he
bawled.

hitting the ground with a loud grunt, he
ran  past  us.  everyone  whooped  to  him.
ahead was a deep washout about ten feet
wide. on the other side was a canebrake.
his long red body, stretched to its fullest
length,  seemed  to  float  in  the  air  as  he
sailed  over  it.  we  could  hear  the  tall
stalks  rattling  as  he  plowed  his  way
through  them.  a  bunch  of  sleepy  snow
birds  rose  from  the  thick  cane,  flitted
over, and settled in a row on the old rail
fence.

nearing the tree, we could see it was a
tall  sycamore,  and  there  high  in  the  top
was the coon.

grandpa threw a fit. he hopped around
whooping and hollering. he threw his old

hat down on the ground and jumped up and
down  on  it.  then  he  ran  over  and  kissed
little ann right on the head.

after  we  killed  and  skinned  the  coon,
the  judge  said,  “let’s  walk  back  to  that
old  fence.  i  think  i  know  how  the  old
fellow pulled his trick.”

back  at  the  fence,  the  judge  stood  and
looked around for a few minutes. smiling,
he said, “yes, that’s how he did it.”

“how?” grandpa asked.
still smiling, the judge said, “that old
coon walked this rail fence. coming even
with  the  hackberry  tree,  he  leaped  up  on
its side, and climbed up. notice how thick
the  timber  is  around  here.  see  that  limb
way up there in the top, the one that runs
over and almost touches the sycamore?”

we saw what he meant.

“the coon walked out on that limb,” he
said,  “leaped  over,  and  caught
the
sycamore  limb.  repeating  this  over  and
over, from tree to tree, he worked his way
far out into the river bottoms. what i can’t
figure out is how that hound found him.”

gazing at little ann, he shook his head
and  said,  “i’ve  been  hunting  coons  and
judging coon hunts for forty years, but i’ve
never seen anything like that.”

he looked at me. “well, son,” he said,
“you have tied the leading teams. there’s
only one more night of eliminations. even
if some of them get more than three coons,
you  will  still  be  in  the  runoff,  and  from
what  i’ve  seen  here  tonight,  you  have  a
good chance of winning the cup.”

i  knew  that  little ann  had  scented  the
coon  in  the  air,  the  same  as  she  had  the

ghost coon. i walked over and knelt down
by her side. the things i wanted to say to
her  i  couldn’t,  for  the  knot  in  my  throat,
but i’m sure she understood.

as  we  came  into  the  campground,  the
hunters  came  out  of
tents  and
gathered around us. the judge held up the
three  big  coon  hides.  there  was  a  roar
from the crowd.

their

one  man  said,  “that  was  the  most

beautiful sight i’ve ever seen.”

“what was a beautiful sight?” grandpa

asked.

“last  night  those  little  red  hounds

brought that coon right through camp.”

the  judge  said,  “we  figured  they  did

when we heard the noise.”

laughing, the man said, “we heard them
when  they  ran  up  the  other  side  of  the

river.  way  up  above  here  they  crossed
over.  we  could  tell  they  were  coming
back so we doused all the fires and, sure
enough,  they  came  right  through  camp.
those two little hounds weren’t fifty yards
behind  the  coon,  running  side  by  side.
boy, they were picking them up and laying
them down, and bawling every time their
feet  touched  the  ground.  i’ll  tell  you,  it
was the prettiest sight i ever saw.”

when the judge started telling about the
last  coon  little ann  had  treed  i  took  my
dogs over to our tent and fed and watered
them. after they had had their fill, i gave
them  a  good  rubdown  with  a  piece  of
gunny sack. taking them out to the buggy, i
tied  them  up.  i  stood  and  watched  while
they twisted around in the hay making their
bed.

that day i tried to get some sleep in our
tent, but the soaking grandpa had taken in
the  river  had  given  him  a  cold,  causing
him to snore. i never heard such a racket
in  all  my  life.  i’d  have  sworn  he  rattled
the  paper  sacks  in  our  grocery  boxes.
taking  a  blanket,  i  went  out  to  my  dogs.
little ann had wiggled up as close to old
dan as she could. prying them apart, i lay
down between them and fell asleep.

the last night of the eliminations turned
out  like  the  second  night.  none  of  the
judges turned in more than two hides.

that day, about noon, the owners of the
other winning teams and i were called for
a conference with the head judge. he said,
“gentlemen,  the  eliminations  are  over.
only  three  sets  of  hounds  are  left  for  the
runoff.  the  winner  of  tonight’s  hunt  will

receive  the  gold  cup.  if  there  is  a  tie  for
the  championship,  naturally  there  will  be
another runoff.”

he  shook  hands  with  each  of  us  and

wished us good luck.

tension began to build up in the camp.
here  and  there  hunters  were  standing  in
small  groups,  talking.  others  could  be
seen going in and out of tents with rolls of
money  in  their  hands.  grandpa  was  the
busiest  one  of  all.  his  voice  could  be
heard  all  over  the  camp.  men  were
looking at me, and talking in low tones. i
strutted like a turkey gobbler.

that  evening,  while  we  were  having
supper,  a  hunter  dropped  by.  he  had  a
small  box  in  his  hand.  smiling,  he  said,
“everyone has agreed that we should have
a jackpot for the winner. i’ve been picked

to do the collecting.”

grandpa said, “you may as well leave

it here now.”

looking at me, the hunter said, “son, i
think  almost  every  man  in  this  camp  is
hoping you win it, but it’s not going to be
easy. you’re going up against four of the
finest  hounds  there  are.”  turning  to  my
father, he said, “did you know the two big
walker hounds have won four gold cups?”
very seriously, papa said, “you know i
have two mules down on my place. one is
almost  as  big  as  a  barn.  the  other  one
isn’t  much  bigger  than  a  jack  rabbit,  but
that  little  mule  can  outpull  the  big  one
every time.”

smiling, the hunter turned to leave. he

said, “you could be right.”

papa  asked  me  again  where  i  thought

we should start hunting.

i had been thinking about this all day. i
said,  “you  remember  where  we  jumped
the last coon in the swamp?”

papa said, “yes.”
“well, the way i figure, more than one
coon lives in that swamp,” i said. “it’s a
good  place  for  them  as  there  are  lots  of
crawfish  and  minnows  in  those  potholes.
if a hound jumps one there, he has a good
chance to tree him.”

papa asked, “why?”
“it’s a long way back to the river, and
about the same distance to the mountains,”
i said. “either way he runs, a dog can get
pretty close to him, and so he would have
to take to a tree.”

that

into
grandpa’s  buggy  and  headed  for  the

evening  we

climbed

swamp.  it  was  dark  by  the  time  we
reached it.

grandpa  handed  papa  his  gun,  saying.
“you’re  getting  to  be  a  pretty  good  shot
with this thing.”

“i  hope  i  get  to  shoot  it  a  lot  tonight,”

papa said.

under my breath, i said, “i do, too.”
after untying the ropes from my dogs, i
held  onto  their  collars  for  a  minute.
pulling  them  up  close,  i  knelt  down  and
whispered, “this is the last night. i know
you’ll do your best.”

they  seemed  to  understand  and  tugged
at their collars. when i turned them loose,
they  started  for  the  timber.  just  as  they
reached  the  dark  shadows,  they  stopped,
turned  around,  and  stared  straight  at  me
for an instant.

the  judge  saw  their  strange  actions.
laying  a  hand  on  my  shoulder,  he  asked,
“what did they say, son?”

i  said,  “nothing  that  anyone  could
understand,  but  i  can  feel  that  they  know
this hunt is important. they know it just as
well as you or i.”

it  was  little  ann  who  found  the  trail.
before the echo of her sharp cry had died
away, old dan’s deep voice floated out of
the swamp.

“well, let’s go,” papa said eagerly.
“no, let’s wait a minute,” i said.
“wait? why?” grandpa asked.
“to see which way he’s going to run,” i

said.

the  coon  broke  out  of  the  swamp  and
headed for the river. listening to my dogs,
i could tell they were close to him. i said

to papa, “i don’t think he’ll ever make it
to  the  river.  they’re  right  on  his  heels
now.”

by the time we had circled the swamp,

they were bawling treed.

the judge said, “boy, that was fast.”
i felt my father’s hand on my shoulder.
looking at me, he smiled and nodded his
head.  papa  and  i  knew  i  had  judged  the
coon  perfectly.  he  didn’t  have  time  to
reach the river or the mountains.

my dogs had treed the coon in a tall ash
which  stood  about  fifty  yards  from  the
river. i knew the fifty yards had saved us a
good hour, because he could have pulled
trick  after  trick  if  he  had  gotten  in  the
water.

we  spied  the  coon  in  the  topmost
branches. at  the  crack  of  the  gun,  he  ran

far out on a limb and jumped. he landed
in  an  old  fallen  treetop.  he  scooted
through  it.  coming  out  on  the  other  side,
he  ran  for  the  river.  the  tangled  mass  of
limbs  slowed  my  dogs  and  they  all  but
tore the treetop apart getting out of it. the
coon  was  just  one  step  ahead  of  them  as
they reached the river. we heard them hit
the water.

running  over,  we  stood  and  watched
the  fight.  the  coon  was  at  home  in  the
river. he crawled up on old dan’s head,
trying to force him under. before he could
do  it,  little  ann  reached  up  and  pulled
him off.

in  a  scared  voice,  papa  said,  “that

water looks deep to me.”

“maybe  you  had  better  call  them  off,”
said the judge. “that’s a big coon and he

could  drown  one  of  them  easily  in  that
deep water.”

“call  them  off?”  i  said.  “why,  you
couldn’t  whip  them  off  with  a  stick.
there’s  no  use  for  anyone  to  get  scared.
they  know  exactly  what  they’re  doing.
i’ve seen this more times than one.”

grandpa  was  scared  and  excited.  he
was jumping up and down, whooping and
hollering.

papa raised the gun to aim.
i  jumped  and  grabbed  his  arm.  “don’t
do that,” i yelled. “you’re sure to hit one
of my dogs.”

round and round in the deep water the
fight  went  on.  the  coon  climbed  on  old
dan’s head and sank his teeth in one of his
long  tender  ears.  old  dan  bawled  with
pain. little ann swam in and caught one of

the  coon’s  hind  legs  in  her  mouth.  she
tried  hard  to  pull  him  off.  all  three
disappeared under the water.

the  judge  said,  “well,  have  you  ever

i held my breath.
the water churned and boiled. all three
came to the top about the same time. the
coon  was  between  the  bank  we  were
standing  on  and  my  dogs.  he  swam
toward  us.  they  caught  him  again  just  as
he reached shore. he fought his way free
and  ran  for  a  large  sycamore.  old  dan
caught  him  just  as  he  started  up.  i  knew
that was the end of the fight.

after it was all over and the coon had
been  skinned,  grandpa  said,  “i  hope  we
don’t have to go through that again tonight.
for a while i sure thought your dogs were
goners.”

seen that? look over there!”

old  dan  was  standing  perfectly  still,
with eyes closed and head hanging down.
little  ann  was  licking  at  his  cut  and
bleeding ears.

then to listen.

“she  always  does  that,”  i  said.  “if
you’ll  watch,  when  she  gets  done  with
him, he’ll do the same for her.”

we  stood  and  watched  until  they  had
finished  doctoring  each  other.  then,
trotting  side  by  side,  they  disappeared  in
the darkness.

we  followed  along,  stopping  now  and

xvii

looking  up  the  sky,  papa  said,  “that  doesn’t
look good up there. i think we are in for a
storm.”

the  sky  had  turned  a  dark  gray.  fast-
moving  clouds  were  rolling  through  the
heavens.

grandpa said, “looks like we’re going

to get some wind, too.”

scared  and  thinking  everyone  might
want  to  stop  hunting  because  of  a  few
clouds, i said, “if a storm is brewing, it’s
a  good  night  to  hunt.  all  game  stirs  just
before a storm.”

thirty  minutes

later,  papa

said,

“listen.”

we’re going to get some wind.”

we  heard  a  rattling  in  the  leaves  and
underbrush. it was beginning to sleet. the
air turned cold and chilly.

we  stood  still.  a  low  moaning  sound
could  be  heard  in  the  tops  of  the  tall
sycamores.

grandpa  said,  “i  was  afraid  of  that.

from far downriver, we heard the deep
baying  of  a  hound  on  a  trail.  it  was  old
dan. seconds later, the rhythmic crying of
little ann could be heard. swallowing the
lump  that  had  jumped  up  in  my  throat,  i
whooped as loud as i could.

the  ground  was  turning  white  with
sleet.  the  storm  had  really  set  in.  we
hurried along.

i said to papa, “if this keeps up that old
coon  won’t  run  long.  he’ll  head  for  his

“if it gets much worse,” grandpa said,
“i know some coon hunters that won’t be
running  very  long.  they’ll  be  frozen  too
stiff to run.”

the judge asked if there was any danger

of getting lost.

“i  don’t  know,”  papa  said.  “it’s  all

den.”

strange country to me.”

my  dogs’  voices  sounded  far  away.  i
knew  they  were  much  closer  than  they
sounded as they were downwind from us.
finding  three  large  sycamores  growing
close together, we stopped on the leeward
side.

papa shouted above the wind, “i don’t

know if we can take much more of this.”

“it  is  bad,”  grandpa  replied,  “and  it

looks like it’s going to get worse.”

i could no longer hear the voices of my
dogs. this had me worried. i didn’t want
to leave them out in the storm.

anyone  hear

the  hounds?”

“can

grandpa asked.

“you  can’t  see  over  fifteen  feet  now,”
the judge said. “do you think we can find
the buggy?”

“i think we can find the buggy all right,”

papa said.

“i can’t,” papa said.
the  judge  spoke  up.  “fellows,  i  think
we’d  better  go  in,”  he  said.  “there’s  no
telling  where  they  are.  they  may  have
crossed the river.”

scared  and  knowing  i  had

to  do
something,  i  said,  “they’re  closer  than
you  think,  probably  treed  by  now.  you
can’t  hear  them  for  this  wind.”  i  begged,

“let’s go a little further.”

there was no reply and no one made a

move to leave the shelter of the trees.

taking a few steps, i said, “i’ll take the

lead. just follow me.”

“billy,  we  couldn’t  find  them,”  papa
said.  “you  can’t  see  or  hear  a  thing.  we
had better start back for camp.”

“i think so, too,” the judge said.
at this remark, i cried, “i’ve been out in
storms like this before, all by myself. i’ve
never left my dogs in the woods, and i’m
not going to now, even if i have to look for
them by myself.”

no one answered.
“please  go  just  a  little  further,”  i

begged. “i just know we’ll hear them.”

still  no  one  spoke  or  made  a  move  to

go on.

stepping over to my father, i buried my
face in his old mackinaw coat. sobbing, i
pleaded with him not to turn back.

he patted my head. “billy,” he said, “a
man  could  freeze  to  death  in  this  storm,
and  besides,  your  dogs  will  give  up  and
come in.”

“that’s what has me worried,” i cried.
“they  won’t  come  in.  they  won’t,  papa.
little ann  might,  but  not  old  dan.  he’d
die before he’d leave a coon in a tree.”

papa  was  undecided.  making  up  his
mind,  he  stepped  away  from  the  tree  and
said to the others, “i’m going on with him.
you fellows coming, or going back?”

he  turned  and  followed  me.  grandpa

and the judge fell in behind him.

by  this  time  the  ground  was  covered
with  a  thin  white  layer  of  sleet.  we  kept

slipping and falling. i could hear grandpa
mumbling  and  grumbling.  the  wind-
driven sleet stung our skin like thousands
of pricking needles. strong gusts of wind
growled  and  moaned  through  the  tops  of
the tall timber.

once  during  a  momentary  lull  of  the
storm,  i  thought  i  heard  the  baying  of  a
hound.  i  told  my  father  i  thought  i  had
heard old dan.

“from which direction?” he asked.
“from that way,” i said, pointing to our

left.

we  started  on.  a  few  minutes  later
to  my

papa
grandfather, “did you hear anything?”

stopped.  he

shouted

“no,”  grandpa  shouted  back.  “i  can’t

hear anything in this storm.”

“i  thought  i  did,  but  i’m  not  sure,”  the

judge said.

asked.

“where  was  it  coming  from?”  papa

“over

that  way,”

the

judge  said,

pointing to our right.

“that’s  the  way  it  sounded  to  me,”

papa said.

voice of old dan.

said.

at that moment, all of us heard the deep

“it sounds as if they’re close,” grandpa

“let’s split up,” said the judge. “maybe

one of us can find them.”

“no,”  papa  said,  “it’d  be  easy  to  get

lost in this storm.”

“i think they’re more to the right of us,”

i said.

“i do, too,” papa said.
we trudged on. old dan bawled again.

the  sound  of  his  voice  seemed  to  be  all
around us.

“the  way  that  wind  is  whipping  the
sound through this timber,” the judge said,
“we’d be lucky if we ever found them.”

papa shouted over the roar of the wind,
“we  can’t  take  much  more  of  this.  we’ll
freeze to death.”

the men were giving up. i felt the knot
again  as  it  crawled  up  in  my  throat.  salt
water  froze  on  my  eyelashes.  kneeling
down, i put my ear close to the icy ground
in  hopes  i  could  hear  my  dogs,  but  i
couldn’t  hear  anything  above  the  roar  of
the blizzard.

standing up, i peered this way and that.
all  i  could  see  was  a  white  wall  of
whirling sleet. i closed my eyes and said a
silent prayer and hoped for a miracle.

we  heard  a  sharp  crack  and  a  loud
crashing noise. a large limb, torn from a
tree by the strong wind, fell to the ground.
the  sharp  crack  of  the  limb  gave  me  the
idea. shouting to my father, i said, “shoot
the  gun.  if  my  dogs  are  close  enough  to
hear it, maybe little ann will come to us.”
papa  didn’t  hesitate.  pointing  the  gun
high  over  his  head,  he  pulled  the  trigger.
the sharp crack rang out into the teeth of
the storm.

we waited.
just  when  i  had  given  up  all  hope  and
had  sunk  to  the  lowest  depth  of  despair,
out of the white wall of driving sleet, my
little  dog  came  to  me.  i  knelt  down  and
gathered her in my arms.

taking  one  of  the  lead  ropes  from  my
pocket, i tied it to her collar. i said, “find

him, little girl. please find old dan.”

right  then  i  didn’t  care  about  coons,
gold cups, or anything. all i wanted was
my dogs.

i  don’t  know  how  she  did  it.  straight
into the face of the storm she led us. time
after  time  she  would  stop  and  turn  her
head  this  way  and  that.  i  knew  she
couldn’t  scent  or  see  anything.  instinct
alone  was  guiding  her.  over  a  winding
and twisting trail, we followed.

coming  out  of  the  bottoms,  she  led  us
into  a  thick  canebrake.  the  tall  stalks
sheltered us from the storm. the roaring of
the wind didn’t seem as loud. like ghostly
figures,  large  trees  loomed  out  of  the
almost solid mass. falling and stumbling,
we kept pushing on.

grandpa  shouted,  “hold  up  a  minute.

i’m just about all in.”

we stopped.
“do  you  think  that  hound  knows  what
she’s  doing?”  the  judge  asked.  “maybe
we’re just running around in circles.”

looking  at  me,  papa  said,  “i  hope  she
does.  some  of  these  canebrakes  cover
miles.  if  we  get  lost  in  here,  we’ll  be  in
bad shape.”

the  judge  spoke  up,  “fellows,  no  dog
is worth the lives of three men. now let’s
do  the  smart  thing  and  get  out  of  here
while we can. our clothes are wet. if we
keep  on  wandering  around  in  this  jungle,

grandpa said, “i think we’ve gone too
far.  the  last  time  i  heard  old  dan,  he
sounded quite close.”

“that was because the wind carried the

sound,” i said.

we’ll freeze to death. it doesn’t look like
this blizzard is ever going to let up.”

i  could  hear  the  roar  of  the  blizzard
back  in  the  thick  timber  of  the  bottoms.
two large limbs being rubbed together by
the strong wind made a grinding creaking
sound.  the  tall  slender  cane  around  us
rattled and swayed.

i  could  feel  the  silence  closing  in.  i
knew  the  judge’s  cold  logic  had  had  its
effect  on  my  father  and  grandfather.  the
men had given up. there was no hope left
for me.

kneeling  down,  i  put  my  arms  around
little ann.  i  felt  the  warm  heat  from  her
moist tongue caressing my ear. closing my
eyes, i said, “please, dan, bawl one more
time, just one more time.”

i waited for my plea to be answered.

with  its  loud  roaring,  the  north  wind
seemed  to  be  laughing  at  us. all  around,
tall  stalks  of  cane  were  weaving  and
dancing  to  the  rattling  rhythm  of  their
knife-edged blades.

my father tried to talk above the wind,
but his words were lost in the storm. just
before another blast, clear as a foghorn on
a  stormy  sea,  old  dan’s  voice  rang  loud
and  clear.  it  seemed  louder  than  the  roar
of the wind or the skeleton-like rustling of
the tall swaying cane.

i  jumped  to  my  feet.  my  heart  did  a
complete  flip-flop.  the  knot  in  my  throat
felt as big as an apple. i tried to whoop,
but it was no use. little ann bawled and
tugged on the rope.

there  was  no  mistaking  the  direction.
we knew that little ann had been right all

along. straight as an arrow, she had led us
to him.

old  dan  was  treed  down  in  a  deep
gully.  i  slid  off  the  bank  and  ran  to  him.
his  back  was  covered  with  a  layer  of
frozen  sleet.  his  frost-covered  whiskers
stood out straight as porcupine quills.

i  worked  the  wedges  of  ice  from
between  his  toes,  and  scraped  the  sleet
from  his  body  with  my  hands.  little ann
came over and tried to wash his face. he
didn’t  like  it.  jerking  loose  from  me,  he
ran  over  to  the  tree,  reared  up  on  it,  and
started bawling.

hearing  shouting  from  the  bank  above
me,  i  looked  up.  i  could  dimly  see  papa
and the judge through the driving sleet. at
first  i  thought  they  were  shouting  to  me,
but on peering closer i could see that they

had  their  backs  to  me.  catching  hold  of
some long stalks of cane that were hanging
down from the steep bank, i pulled myself
up.

papa shouted in my ear, “something has

happened to your grandfather.”

turning to the judge, he said, “he was
behind  you.  when  was  the  last  time  you
saw him?”

“i don’t know for sure,” the judge said.
“i guess it was back there when we heard
the hound bawl.”

“didn’t  you  hear  anything?”  papa

asked.

“hear  anything?”  the  judge  exclaimed.
“how  could  i  hear  anything  in  all  that
noise? i thought he was behind me all the
time,  and  didn’t  miss  him  until  we  got
here.”

that.”

i  tried  to  tear  away  from  him  but  his

grip on my arm was firm.

i  couldn’t  hold  back  the  tears.  my
grandfather was lost and wandering in that
white jungle of cane. screaming for him, i
started back.

papa caught me. he shouted, “don’t do

“shoot the gun,” the judge said.
papa  shot  time  after  time.  it  was

useless. we got no answer.

little ann came up out of the washout.
she  stood  and  stared  at  me.  turning,  she
disappeared  quickly  in  the  thick  cane.
minutes later we heard her. it was a long,
mournful cry.

the  only  times  i  had  ever  heard  my
little  dog  bawl  like  that  were  when  she
was  baying  at  a  bright  ozark  moon,  or

when someone played a french harp or a
fiddle  close  to  her  ear.  she  didn’t  stop
until we reached her.

grandpa  lay  as  he  had  fallen,  face
down  in  the  icy  sleet.  his  right  foot  was
wedged in the fork of a broken box elder
limb.  when  the  ankle  had  twisted,  the
searing  pain  must  have  made  him
unconscious.

“i think he’s gone,” the judge said.
“i don’t think so,” papa said. “he took

papa  worked  grandpa’s  foot  free  and
turned him over. i sat down and placed his
head in my lap. while papa and the judge
massaged  his  arms  and  legs,  i  wiped  the
frozen sleet from his eyes and face.

burying my face in the iron-gray hair, i
cried  and  begged  god  not  to  let  my
grandfather die.

a bad fall when that limb tripped him, but
he  hasn’t  been  lying  here  long  enough  to
be frozen. i think he’s just unconscious.”

papa lifted him to a sitting position and
told  the  judge  to  start  slapping  his  face.
grandpa moaned and moved his head.
“he’s coming around,” papa said.
i asked papa if we could get him back
to  the  gully  where  old  dan  was.  i  had
noticed  there  was  very  little  wind  there
and we could build a fire.

“that’s the very place,” he said. “we’ll
build a good fire and one of us can go for
help.”

papa  and  the  judge  made  a  seat  by
catching  each  other’s  wrists.  they  eased
grandpa between them.

by  the  time  we  reached  the  washout,
grandpa  was  fully  conscious  again,  and

was mumbling and grumbling. he couldn’t
see why they had to carry him like a baby.
after  easing  him  over  the  bank  and
down into the gully, we built a large fire.
papa took his knife and cut the boot from
grandpa’s swollen foot. grandpa grunted
and groaned from the pain. i felt sorry for
him  but  there  was  nothing  i  could  do  but
look on.

“what time is it?” he asked.
the  judge  looked  at  his  watch.  “it’s

papa  examined  the  foot.  shaking  his
head, he said, “boy, that’s a bad one. it’s
either broken or badly sprained. i’ll go for
some help.”

grandpa said, “now wait just a minute.
i’m  not  going  to  let  you  go  out  in  that
blizzard  by  yourself.  what  if  something
happens to you? no one would know.”

almost five o’clock,” he said.

“it’s  not  long  till  daylight,”  grandpa
said. “then if you want to go, you can see
where  you’re  going.  now  help  me  get
propped  up  against  this  bank.  i’ll  be  all
right.  it  doesn’t  hurt  any  more.  it’s  numb
now.”

“he’s right,” the judge said.
“think you can stand it?” papa asked.
grandpa roared like a bear. “sure i can
stand it. it’s nothing but a sprained ankle.
i’m  not  going  to  die.  build  that  fire  up  a
little more.”

the

while  papa  and

judge  made
grandpa comfortable, i carried wood for
the fire.

“there’s  no  use

standing  around
gawking  at  me,”  grandpa  said.  “i’m  all
right. get the coon out of that tree. that’s

the tree was about thirty feet from our
fire.  we  walked  over  and  took  a  good
look  at  it  for  the  first  time.  my  dogs,
seeing we were finally going to pay some
attention  to  them,  started  bawling  and
running around the tree.

papa said, “it’s not much of a tree, just
an old box elder snag. there’s not a limb
on it.”

“i  can’t  see  any  coon,”  said  the  judge.

“it must be hollow.”

what we came for, isn’t it?”

up  until  then,  the  coon-hunting  had

practically been forgotten.

papa  beat  on  its  side  with  the  ax.  it
gave forth a loud booming sound. he said,
“it’s hollow all right.”

he  stepped  back  a  few  steps,  scraped
his  feet  on  the  slick  ground  for  a  good

footing,  and  said,  “stand  back,  and  hold
those hounds. i’m going to cut it down. we
need some wood for our fire anyway.”

squatting  down  between  my  dogs,  i

held onto their collars.

papa  notched  the  old  snag  so  it  would
fall  away  from  our  fire. as  the  heavy  ax
chewed  its  way  into  the  tree,  it  began  to
lean  and  crack.  papa  stopped  chopping.
he said to the judge, “come on and help
me. i think we can push it over now.”

after  much  grunting  and  pushing,

snapping and popping, it fell.

i turned my dogs loose.
on hitting the ground, the snag split and
broke  up.  goggle-eyed,  i  stood  rooted  in
my  tracks  and  watched  three  big  coons
roll out of the busted old trunk.

one  started  up  the  washout,  running

between  us  and  the  fire.  old  dan  caught
him and the fight was on. the second coon
headed  down  the  washout.  little  ann
caught him.

hearing  a  loud  yell  from  grandpa,  i
looked  that  way.  old  dan  and  the  coon
were  fighting  close  to  his  feet.  he  was
yelling  and  beating  at  them  with  his  hat.
the judge and papa ran to help.

the  third  coon  started  climbing  up  the
steep  bank  close  to  me.  just  before
reaching the top, his claws slipped in the
icy mud. tumbling end over end, down he
came. i grabbed up a stick and threw it at
him.  growling  and  showing  his  teeth,  he
started for me. i threw the fight to him then
and there. some ten yards away i looked
back. he was climbing the bank. that time
he  made  it  and  disappeared  in  the  thick

hearing  a  squall  of  pain  from  little
ann,  i  turned.  the  coon  was  really
working her over. he had climbed up on
her  back  and  was  tearing  and  slashing.
she  couldn’t  shake  him  off.  grabbing  a
club from the ground, i ran to help her.

before  we  had  killed  our  coon,  old
dan  came  tearing  in.  we  stood  and
watched  the  fight.  when  the  coon  was
dead,  papa  picked  it  up  and  we  walked
back to the fire.

“how  many  coons  were  in  that  old

cane.

snag?” papa asked.

“i saw three,” i said. “the one that got
away climbed out over there.” i pointed in
the direction the coon had taken.

i  never  should  have  pointed.  my  dogs
turned  as  one,  and  started  bawling  and

clawing  their  way  up  the  steep  bank.  i
shouted and scolded, but to no avail. they
disappeared in the rattling cane.

we stood still, listening to their voices.
the sound died away in the roaring storm.
sitting down close to the fire, i buried my
face in my arms and cried.

i heard the judge say to my father, “this
beats  anything  i  have  ever  seen.  why,
those  dogs  can  read  that  boy’s  mind.  he
just  pointed  at  that  bank  and  away  they
went. i never saw anything like it. i can’t
understand  some  of  the  things  they  have
done  tonight.  hounds  usually  aren’t  that
smart. if they were collies, or some other
breed  of  dog,  it  would  be  different,  but
they’re
redbone  hounds,  hunting
dogs.”

just

papa  said,  “yes,  i  know  what  you

mean.  i’ve  seen  them  do  things  that  i
couldn’t  understand.  i’d  never  heard  of
hounds  that  ever  had  any  affection  for
anyone,  but  these  dogs  are  different.  did
you know they won’t hunt with anyone but
him, not even me?”

hearing my grandfather call my name, i
went  over  and  sat  down  by  his  side.
putting his arm around me, he said, “now,
i  wouldn’t  worry  about
those  dogs.
they’ll  be  all  right.  it’s  not  long  till
daylight. then you can go to them.”

i  said,  “yes,  but  what  if  the  coon
crosses  the  river?  my  dogs  will  follow
him.  if  they  get  wet  they  could  freeze  to
death.”

“we’ll  just  have  to  wait  and  hope  for
the best,” he said. “now straighten up and
quit that sniffling. act like a coon hunter.

you  don’t  see  me  bawling,  and  this  old
foot is paining me something awful.”

i felt better after my talk with grandpa.
“come on, let’s skin these coons,” papa

said.

i got up to help him.
after  the  skins  were  peeled  from  the
carcasses,  i  had  an  idea.  holding  one  up
close to the fire until it was warm, i took
it over and wrapped it around grandpa’s
foot.  chuckling,  he  said,  “boy,  that  feels
good. heat another skin the same way.”

i kept it up for the rest of the night.

just  before  dawn,  the  storm  blew  itself  out
with one last angry roar. it started snowing.
a
the

canebrake.

settled  over

silence

back  in  the  thick  timber  of  the  river
bottoms,  the  sharp  snapping  of  frozen
limbs  could  be  heard.  the  tall  stalks  of
wild  cane  looked  exhausted  from  the
hellish  night.  they  were  drooping  and
bending  from  the  weight  of  the  frozen
sleet.

i  climbed  out  of  the  deep  gully  and
listened for my dogs. i couldn’t hear them.
just  as  i  started  back  down  the  bank,  i
heard something. i listened. again i heard

the sound.

papa was watching me. “can you hear

the dogs?” he asked.

“no,  not  the  dogs,”  i  said,  “but  i  can

hear something else.”

“what does it sound like?” he asked.
“like someone whooping,” i said.
papa and the judge hurried up the bank.
we heard the sound again. it was coming
from a different direction.

“the  first  time  i  heard  it,”  i  said,  “it

was over that way.”

“it’s  the  men  from  camp,”  the  judge

said. “they’re searching for us.”

we  started  whooping.  the  searchers
answered.  their  voices  came  from  all
directions.  the  first  one  to  reach  us  was
mr.  kyle.  he  looked  haggard  and  tired.
he asked if everything was all right.

“yes, we’re all right,” papa said, “but
the old man has a bad ankle. it looks like
we’ll have to carry him out.”

“your team broke loose and came back
to  camp  about  midnight,”  mr.  kyle  said.
“this  really  spooked  us.  we  were  sure
something bad had happened. twenty-five
of us have been searching since then.”

“yes,”  another  said,  “and  if  i  know
charley,  he’s  probably  got  a  small

several  men  climbed  down  the  bank
and went over to grandpa. they looked at
his  ankle.  one  said,  “i  don’t  think  it’s
broken, but it sure is a bad sprain.”

“you’re  in  luck,”  another  one  said.
“we  have  one  of  the  best  doctors  in  the
state  of  texas  in  our  camp,  dr.  charley
lathman.  he’ll  have  you  fixed  up  in  no
time.”

hospital with him.”

back in the crowd, i heard another man
say, “you mean that lathman fellow, who
owns  those  black  and  tan  hounds,  is  a
doctor?”

“sure  is,”  another  said.  “one  of  the

best.”

mr. kyle asked where my dogs were. i
told him that they were treed somewhere.
treed

you  mean,

“what

do

somewhere?” he asked.

papa explained what had happened.
with a wide-eyed look on his face, he
said,  “do  you  mean  to  tell  me  those
hounds  stayed  with
that
blizzard?”
i nodded.
looking  at  me,  he  said,  “son,  i  hope
they  have  that  coon  treed,  because  you

need  that  one  to  win  the  cup.  those  two
walker  hounds  caught  three  before  the
storm  came  up.  when  it  got  bad,  all  the
hunters came in.”

the

judge  spoke  up.  “i’ll  always
believe  that  those  hounds  knew  that  boy
needed another coon to win,” he said. “if
you  fellows  had  seen  some  of  the  things
those  dogs  have  done,  you’d  believe  it,
too.”

one  hunter  walked  over  to  the  broken
snag. “three out of one tree,” he said. “no
wonder,  look  here!  that  old  snag  was
half-full of leaves and grass. why, it was
a regular old den tree.”

several of the men walked over. i heard
one  say,  “i’ve  seen  this  happen  before.
remember that big hunt in the red river
bottoms, when the two little beagle hounds

treed  four  coons  in  an  old  hollow  snag?
they won the championship, too.”

“i wasn’t there but i remember reading

about it,” one said.

“say,  i  don’t  see  benson,”  mr.  kyle

said.

the men started looking at each other.
“he  was  searching  farther  downriver
than  the  rest  of  us,”  one  fellow  said.
“maybe he didn’t hear us shouting.”

some  of  the  men  climbed  out  of  the
gully.  they  started  whooping.  from  a
distance we heard an answering shout.

“he  hears  us,”  someone  said.  “he’s

coming.”

everyone looked relieved.
mr.  benson  struck  the  washout  a  little
way above us. he was breathing hard, as
if he’d been running. he started talking as

soon as he was within hearing distance.

“it scared me when i first saw them,” he
said. “i didn’t know what they were. they
looked  like  white  ghosts.  i’d  never  seen
anything like it.”

a  hunter  grabbed  mr.  benson  by  the
shoulder,  shaking  him.  “get  ahold  of
yourself,  man,”  he  said.  “what  are  you
talking about?”

mr.  benson  took  a  deep  breath  to
control  himself,  and  started  again  in  a
much calmer voice. “those two hounds,”
he  said.  “i  found  them.  they’re  frozen
solid. they’re nothing but white ice from
the tips of their noses to the ends of their
tails.”

hearing  mr.  benson’s  words,

i
screamed and ran to my father. everything
started whirling around and around. i felt

light  as  a  feather.  my  knees  buckled.  i
knew no more.

regaining  consciousness,  i  opened  my
eyes  and  could  dimly  see  the  blurry
images of the men around me. a hand was
shaking me. i could hear my father’s voice
but i couldn’t understand his words. little
by  little  the  blackness  faded  away.  my
throat was dry and i was terribly thirsty. i
asked for some water.

mr. benson came over. he said, “son,
i’m sorry, truly sorry. i didn’t mean it that
way. your  dogs  are  alive.  i  guess  i  was
excited. i’m very sorry.”

i heard a deep voice say, “that’s a hell
of  a  thing  to  do.  come  running  in  here
saying the dogs are frozen solid.”

mr.  benson  said,  “i  didn’t  mean  it  to
sound  that  way.  i  said  i’m  sorry.  what

the deep voice growled again. “i still
think it was a hell of a thing for a man to
do.”

mr.  kyle  took  over.  “now  let’s  not
have any more of this,” he said. “we have
work  to  do.  we’ve  been  standing  here
acting like a bunch of schoolkids. all this
time  that  old  man  has  been  lying  there
suffering.  a  couple  of  you  men  cut  two
poles and make a stretcher to carry him.”

while  the  men  were  getting  the  poles,
papa  heated  the  coonskins  again  and
rewrapped grandpa’s foot.

more do you want me to do?”

with  belts  and  long  leather  laces  from
their  boots,  the  hunters  made  a  stretcher.
very gently they put grandpa on it.

again mr. kyle took command. “part of
us will start for camp with him,” he said.

looking  at  me,  mr.  kyle  said,  “come

on, son. i want to see your hounds.”

mr.  benson  led  the  way.  “as  soon  as
we get out of this cane,” he said, “we may
be able to hear them. they have the coon
treed  in  a  big  black  gum  tree.  you’re
going to see a sight. now i mean a sight.
they’ve  walked  a  ring  around  that  tree
clear down through the ice and snow. you
can see the bare ground.”

“wonder  why  they  did  that?”  someone

asked.

“the others will go after the dogs.”

“here,  take  this  gun,”  papa  said.  “i’ll

go with him.”

“i  don’t  know,”  mr.  benson  replied,
“unless they ran in that circle to keep from
freezing  to  death,  or  to  keep  the  coon  in
the tree.”

nearing

the

stared.

i  figured  i  knew  why  my  dogs  were
covered with ice. the coon had probably
crossed  the  river,  maybe  several  times.
old  dan  and  little  ann  would  have
followed  him.  they  had  come  out  of  the
river  with  their  coats  dripping  wet,  and
the freezing blast of the blizzard had done
the rest.

tree,  we  stopped  and

“did  you  ever  see  anything  like  that?”
mr.  benson  asked.  “when  i  first  saw
them, i thought they were white wolves.”

my dogs hadn’t seen us when we came
up.  they  were  trotting  round  and  round.
just as mr. benson had said, we could see
the  path  they  had  worn  down  through  the
ice and snow till the bare black earth was
visible.  like  ghostly  white  shadows,

around and around they trotted.

in  a  low  voice,  someone  said,  “they
know  that  if  they  stop  they’ll  freeze  to
death.”

“it’s  unbelievable,”  said  mr.  kyle.
“come on. we must do something quick.”
with a choking sob, i ran for my dogs.
on hearing our approach, they sat down
and  started  bawling  treed.  i  noticed  their
voices  didn’t  have  that  solid  ring.  their
ice-covered tails made a rattling sound as
they switched this way and that on the icy
ground.

a  large  fire  was  built.  standing  my
dogs  close  to  the  warm  heat,  the  gentle
hands  of  the  hunters  went  to  work.  with
handkerchiefs
heated
steaming  hot,  little  by  little  the  ice  was
thawed from their bodies.

scarves

and

“if they had ever lain down,” someone

said, “they would’ve frozen to death.”

“they  knew  it,”  another  said.  “that’s

why they kept running in that circle.”

“what  i  can’t  understand  is  why  they
stayed  with  the  tree,”  mr.  benson  said.
“i’ve  seen  hounds  stay  with  a  tree  for  a
while, but not in a northern blizzard.”

“men,”  said  mr.  kyle,  “people  have
been trying to understand dogs ever since
the  beginning  of  time.  one  never  knows
what  they’ll  do. you  can  read  every  day
where a dog saved the life of a drowning
child, or lay down his life for his master.
some  people  call  this  loyalty.  i  don’t.  i
may  be  wrong,  but  i  call  it  love—the
deepest kind of love.”

after  these  words  were  spoken,  a
thoughtful  silence  settled  over  the  men.

the  deep
the  mood  was  broken  by
growling  voice  i  had  heard  back  in  the
washout.

“it’s  a  shame  that  people  all  over  the
world can’t have that kind of love in their
hearts,”  he  said.  “there  would  be  no
wars,  slaughter,  or  murder;  no  greed  or
selfishness. it would be the kind of world
that  god  wants  us  to  have—a  wonderful
world.”

said.

after  all  the  ice  was  thawed  from  my
dogs  and  their  coats  were  dried  out,  i
could see they were all right. i was happy
again and felt good all over.

one of the hunters said, “do you think
those  hounds  are  thawed  out  enough  to
fight a coon?”

“sure,  just  run  him  out  of  that  tree,”  i

at the crack of the gun, the coon ran far
out on a big limb and stopped. again the
hunter sprinkled him with bird shot. this
time  he  jumped.  hitting  the  ground,  he
crouched down.

old  dan  made  a  lunge.  just  as  he
reached  him,  the  coon  sprang  straight  up
and  came  down  on  his  head.  holding  on
with his claws, the coon sank his teeth in a
long tender ear. old dan was furious. he
started  turning  in  a  circle,  bawling  with
pain.

little ann was trying hard to get ahold
of  the  coon  but  she  couldn’t.  because  of
his  fast  circling,  old  dan’s  feet  flew  out
from  under  him  and  he  fell.  this  gave
little ann a chance. darting in, her jaws
closed  on  the  back  of  the  coon’s  neck.  i
knew the fight was over.

arriving back at camp, i saw that all the
tents  had  been  taken  down  but  ours.  a
hunter  said,  “everyone  was  in  a  hurry  to
get out before another blizzard sets in.”

papa  told  me  to  take  my  dogs  into  the

tent as grandpa wanted to see them.

i saw tears in my grandfather’s eyes as
he talked to them. his ankle was wrapped
in  bandages.  his  foot  and  toes  were
swollen  to  twice  their  normal  size.  they
had
turned  a  greenish-yellow  color.
placing my hand on his foot, i could feel
the feverish heat.

dr. lathman came over. “are you ready

to go now?” he asked.

snorting and growling, grandpa said, “i
told you i wasn’t going anywhere till i see
the gold cup handed to this boy.”

turning to face the crowd, dr. lathman

said,  “men,  let’s  get  this  over.  i  want  to
get  this  man  to  town.  that’s  one  of  the
meanest  sprains  i’ve  ever  seen  and  it
should  be  in  a  cast,  but  i  don’t  have  any
plaster of paris with me.”

the  hunter  who  had  come  by  our  tent
collecting  the  jackpot  money  came  up  to
me.  handing  me  the  box,  he  said,  “here
you  are,  son.  there’s  over  three  hundred
dollars in this box. it’s all yours.”

turning

the  crowd,  he

said,
“fellows,  i  can  always  say  this.  on  this
hunt i’ve seen two of the finest little coon
hounds i ever hope to see.”

to

there was a roar of approval from the

crowd.

looking  down,  i  saw  the  box  was
almost  full  of  money.  i  was  shaking  all
over.  i  tried  to  say  “thanks,”  but  it  was

only a whisper. turning, i handed the box
to  my  father.  as  his  rough  old  hands
closed  around  it,  i  saw  a  strange  look
come over his face. he turned and looked
at my dogs.

some of the men started shouting, “here

it is!”

the crowd parted and the judge walked
through.  i  saw  the  gleaming  metal  of  the
gold cup in his hand. after a short speech,
he  handed  it  to  me,  saying,  “son,  this
makes me very proud. it’s a great honor to
present you with this championship cup.”
the  crowd  exploded.  the  hunters’

shouts were deafening.

i don’t know from where the two silly
old  tears  came.  they  just  squeezed  their
way  out.  i  felt  them  as  they  rolled  down
my  cheeks.  one  dropped  on  the  smooth

surface of the cup and splattered. i wiped
it away with my sleeve.

turning  to  my  dogs,  i  knelt  down  and
showed the cup to them. little ann licked
it.  old  dan  sniffed  one  time,  and  then
turned his head away.

the judge said, “son, there’s a place on
the cup to engrave the names of your dogs.
i can take it into oklahoma city and have
it done, or you can have it done yourself.
the  engraving  charge  has  already  been
paid by the association.”

looking  at  the  cup,  it  seemed  that  far
down in the gleaming shadows i could see
two  wide  blue  eyes  glued
to  a
windowpane.  i  knew  that  my  little  sister
was watching the road and waiting for our
return.  looking  back  at  the  judge,  i  said,
“if you don’t mind, i’ll take it with me. my

grandfather can send it in for me.”

i went over and kissed grandpa good-

laughing,  he  said,  “that’s  all  right.”
handing me a slip of paper, he said, “this
is the address where you should send it.”
grandpa said, “now that that’s settled,
i’m ready to go to town.” turning to papa,
he said, “you’ll have to bring the buggy,
and  i  wish  you’d  look  after  my  stock.  i
know grandma will want to go in with us
and there’ll be no one there to feed them.
tell bill lowery to come up and take care
of  the  store.  you’ll  find  the  keys  in  the
usual place.”

“well  take  care  of  everything,”  papa
said.  “don’t  worry  about  a  thing.  i  don’t
intend to stop until we get back, because it
looks  like  we’re  in  for  some  more  bad
weather.”

and
cheek,
bye.  he  pinched  my
whispered,  “we’ll
these  city
teach
slickers that they can’t come up here and
beat our dogs.”

i smiled.
grandpa  was  carried  out  and  made
comfortable  in  the  back  seat  of  dr.
lathman’s  car.  i  stood  and  watched  as  it
wheezed and bounced its way out of sight.
“while i’m harnessing the team,” papa
said, “you take the tent down and pack our
gear.”

on the back seat of the buggy, i made a
bed  out  of  our  bed-clothes.  down  on  the
floor  boards,  i  fixed  a  nice  place  for  my
dogs.

all  through  the  night,  the  creaking
wheels  of  our  buggy  moved  on.  several
times i woke up. my father had wrapped a

tarp  around  himself.  reaching  down,  i
could feel my dogs. they were warm and
comfortable.

early the next morning, we stopped for
breakfast. while papa tended to the team,
i  turned  my  dogs  loose  and  let  them
stretch.

“we  made  good  time  last  night,”  papa
said.  “if  everything  goes  right,  we’ll  be
home long before dark.”

reaching grandpa’s store in the middle
of  the  afternoon,  papa  said,  “i’ll  put  the
team in the barn and feed the stock while
you unload the buggy.”

coming back from the barn, he said, “in
the  morning,  i’ll  go  over  and  tell  bill
lowery to come up and open the store.”

looking  around,  he  said,  “it  snowed
more  here  than  it  did  where  we  were

hunting.”

feeling  big  and  important,  i  said,  “i
don’t like the looks of this weather. we’d
better be scooting for home.”

papa  laughed.  “sure  you’re  not  in  a
hurry  to  get  home  to  show  off  the  gold
cup?” he asked.

a smile was my only answer.
two  hundred  yards  this  side  of  our
home, the road made a turn around a low
foothill shutting our house off from view.
papa  said,  “you’re  going  to  see  a
scramble as soon as we round that bend.”
it  was  more  of  a  stampede  than  a
scramble.  the  little  one  came  out  first,
and  all  but  tore  the  screen  door  from  its
hinges.  the  older  girls  passed  her  just
beyond the gate. in her hurry, she slipped
and  fell  face  down  in  the  snow.  she

started crying.

the  older  girls  ran  up  asking  for  the

holding  it  high  over  my  head,  i  said,
“now wait a minute. i’ve got another one
for  you  two.”  i  held  the  small  silver  cup
out to them.

while  they  were  fighting  over  it,  i  ran
to the little one. picking her up, i brushed
the snow from her long, braided hair and
her tear-stained face. i told her there was
no use to cry. i had brought the gold cup to
her, and no one else was going to get it.

reaching for the cup, she wrapped her
small arms around it. squeezing it up tight,
she ran for the house to show it to mama.
mama came out on the porch. she was
just as excited as the girls were. she held
out her arms. i ran to her. she hugged me

“it’s good to have you home again,” she

“look  what  i  have,  mama,”  the  little

one cried, “and it’s all mine.”

she held the golden cup out in her two

small hands.

and kissed me.

said.

as  mama  took  the  beautiful  cup,  she
looked at me. she started to say something
but  was  interrupted  by  the  cries  from  the
other girls.

“we have one, too, mama,” they cried,

“and it’s just as pretty as that one.”

“it’s not either,” the little one piped in a
defiant  voice.  “it’s  not  even  as  big  as
mine.”

“two  cups!”  mama  exclaimed.  “did

you win two?”

“yes,  mama,”  i  said.  “little ann  won

that one all by herself.”

the  awed  expression  on  my  mother’s
face was wonderful to see. holding a cup
in each hand, she held them out in front of
her.

“two,”  she  said.  “a  gold  one  and  a
silver  one.  who  would  have  thought
anything
could  have
happened  to  us.  i’m  so  proud;  so  very
proud.”

so  wonderful

handing the cups back to the girls, she
walked  over  to  papa.  after  kissing  him,
she  said,  “i  just  can’t  believe  everything
that  has  happened.  i’m  so  glad  you  went
along. did you enjoy yourself?”

with  a  smile  on  his  face,  papa  almost
shouted, “enjoy myself? why, i never had
such a time in my life.”

his  voice  trailed  off  to  a  low  calm,

“that  is,  except  for  one  thing.  grandpa
had a bad accident.”

“yes,  i  know,”  mama  said.  “one  of
tom logan’s boys was at the store when
they  arrived.  he  came  by  and  told  us  all
about it. the doctor said it wasn’t as bad
as  it  looked,  and  he  was  pretty  sure
grandpa would be home in a few days.”

i  was  happy  to  hear  this  news,  and
could  tell  by  the  pleased  look  on  my
father’s face, he was glad to hear it, too.

on entering the house, papa said, “oh, i
almost  forgot.”  he  handed  the  box  of
money to mama.

“what’s this?” she asked.
“oh, it’s just a little gift from old dan

and little ann,” papa said.

mama opened the box. i saw the color
drain  from  her  face.  her  hands  started

trembling.  turning  her  back  to  us,  she
walked  over  and  set  it  on  the  mantel. a
peaceful  silence  settled  over  the  room.  i
could  hear  the  clock  ticking  away.  the
fire in the fireplace crackled and popped.
turning from the mantel, mama looked
straight  at  us.  her  lips  were  tightly
pressed
them  from
quivering.  walking  slowly  to  papa,  she
buried  her  face  in  his  chest.  i  heard  her
say,  “thank  god,  my  prayers  have  been
answered.”

to  keep

together

there  was  a  celebration  in  our  home
that  night.  to  me  it  was  like  a  second
christmas.

mama  opened  a  jar  of  huckleberries
and  made  a  large  cobbler.  papa  went  to
the  smokehouse  and  came  back  with  a
hickory-cured ham. we sat down to a feast

of the ham, huge plates of fried potatoes,
ham  gravy,  hot  corn  bread,  fresh  butter,
and wild bee honey.

during the course of the meal, the entire
story  of  the  championship  hunt  was  told,
some by papa but mostly by me.

just  when  everything  was  so  perfect
and  peaceful,  an  argument  sprang  up
between  the  two  oldest  girls.  it  seemed
that  each  wanted  to  claim  the  silver  cup.
just  when  they  were  on  the  verge  of
sawing it in two, so each would have her
allotted  share,  papa  settled  the  squabble
by  giving  the  oldest  one  a  silver  dollar.
once  again  peace  and  harmony  was
restored.

that night as i was preparing for bed, a
light  flashed  by  my  window.  puzzled,  i
tiptoed over and peeked through the pane.

it was mama. carrying my lantern and two
large  plates  heaped  high  with  food,  she
was heading for the doghouse. setting the
light down on the ground in front of it, she
called to my dogs. while they were eating,
mama
couldn’t
understand.  she  knelt  down  on  her  knees
in prayer.

i

after  they  had  eaten  their  food,  mama
started petting them. i could hear her voice
but  couldn’t  make  out  her  words.
whatever  she  was  saying  must  have
pleased  them.  little  ann  wiggled  and
twisted.  even  old  dan  wagged  his  long
red tail, which was very unusual.

papa  came  out.  i  saw  him  put  his  arm
around mama. side by side they stood for
several minutes looking at my dogs. when
they turned to enter the house, i saw mama

lying in bed, staring into the darkness, i
tried hard to figure out the strange actions
of  my  parents.  why  had  mama  knelt  in
prayer in front of my dogs? why had she
wept?

i  was  running  all  the  why’s  around  in

my mind when i heard them talking.

dab at her eyes with her apron.

“i know,” papa said, “but i think there’s
a  way.  i’m  going  to  have  a  talk  with
grandpa. i don’t think that old foot of his
is  ever  going  to  be  the  same  again.  he’s
going to need some help around the store.”
i knew they were talking about me, but i
couldn’t understand what they meant. then
i thought, “why, that’s it. they want me to
help  grandpa.”  that  would  be  all  right
with me. i could still hunt every night.

conversation,  i

although  the  winning  of  the  cups  and  the
money was a big event in my life, it didn’t
change my hunting any. i was out after the
ringtails every night.

i  had  been  hunting  the  river  bottoms
hard for about three weeks. on that night, i
decided to go back to the cyclone timber
country.  i  had  barely  reached  the  hunting
ground  when  my  dogs  struck  a  trail.  old
dan opened up first.

they struck the trail on a ridge and then
dropped down into a deep canyon, up the
other side, and broke out into some flats. i
could tell that the scent was hot from their
steady bawling. three times they treed the

animal.

every time i came close to the tree, the
animal would jump, and the race would be
on. after a while, i knew it wasn’t a coon.
i decided it was a bobcat.

i  didn’t  like  to  have  my  dogs  tree  the
big cats, for their fur wasn’t any good, and
all i could expect was two cut-up hounds.
they could kill the largest bobcat in the
hills, and had on several occasions, but to
me it was useless. the only good i could
see  in  killing  one  was  getting  rid  of  a
vicious predatory animal.

the fourth time they treed, they were on
top of a mountain. after the long chase, i
figured the animal was winded and would
stay in the tree. in a trot i started to them.

as i neared the tree, little ann came to
me,  reared  up,  and  whined.  by  her

actions,  i  knew  something  was  wrong.  i
stopped. in the moonlight, i could see old
dan sitting on his haunches, staring up at
the tree and bawling.

the tree had lots of dead leaves on it. i
knew it was a large white oak because it
is one of the last trees in the mountains to
lose its leaves.

old  dan  kept  bawling.  then  he  did
something he had never done before. for
seconds  his  deep  voice  was  still,  and
silence  settled  over  the  mountains.  my
eyes  wandered  from  the  tree  to  him.  his
lips were curled back and he snarled as he
stared into the dark foliage of the tree. his
teeth gleamed white in the moonlight. the
hair on his neck and along his back stood
on  end.  a  low,  deep,  rumbling  growl
rolled from his throat.

i  was  scared  and  i  called  to  him.  i
wanted  to  get  away  from  there.  again  i
called,  but  it  was  no  use.  he  wouldn’t
leave the tree, for in his veins flowed the
breeded  blood  of  a  hunting  hound.  in  his
fighting heart, there was no fear.

i set the lantern down and tightened my
grip  on  the  handle  of  the  ax.  slowly  i
started walking toward him. i thought, “if i
can get close enough to him, i can grab his
collar.”  i  kept  my  eyes  on  the  tree  as  i
edged  forward.  little  ann  stayed  by  my
side. she, too, was watching the tree.

then i saw them—two burning, yellow
eyes—staring  at  me  from  the  shadowy
foliage  of  the  tree.  i  stopped,  petrified
with fear.

the  deep  baying  of  old  dan  stopped

and again the silence closed in.

i stared back at the unblinking eyes.
i  could  make  out  the  bulk  of  a  large
animal, crouched on a huge branch, close
to the trunk of the big tree. then it moved.
i  heard  the  scratch  of  razor-sharp  claws
on the bark. it stood up and moved out of
the  shadows  on  to  the  limb.  i  saw  it
clearly as it passed between the moon and
me. i knew what it was. it was the devil
cat of the ozarks, the mountain lion.

the silence was shattered by one long,
loud bawl from old dan. i’d never heard
my  dog  bawl  like  that.  it  was  different.
his  voice  rang  out  over  the  mountains,
loud and clear. the vibration of the deep
tones  rolled  in  the  silence  of  the  frosty
night, on and on, out over the flats, down
in  the  canyons,  and  died  away  in  the
rimrocks,  like  the  cry  of  a  lost  soul.  old

dan had voiced his challenge to the devil
cat.

there  was  a  low  cough  and  a  deep
growl  from  the  lion.  i  saw  him  crouch.  i
knew what was coming. my hands felt hot
and  sweaty  on  the  smooth  ash  handle  of
the  ax.  with  a  blood-curdling  scream  he
sprang from the tree with claws outspread
and long, yellow fangs bared.

old dan didn’t wait. rearing up on his
hind  legs,  he  met  the  lion  in  the  air.  the
heavy weight bowled him over and over.
he wound up in a fallen treetop.

the impact of the two bodies threw the
lion off balance. little ann darted in. her
aim was true. i heard the snap of her steel-
trap jaws as they closed on his throat.

with a squall of pain and rage, the big
cat rolled over on his side, dragging little

ann with him. his right paw reached out
and  curved  over  her  shoulder.  sinews
tightened  and  razor-sharp  claws  dug
inward. with a cry of pain, she loosened
her  hold.  i  saw  the  blood  squirting  from
the  deep  wound  in  her  shoulder.  she
ignored it and bored back into the fight.

old dan, stunned for an instant from the
impact of the lion’s body, fought his way
from  the  treetop.  bawling  the  cry  of  the
damned, he charged back in.

i  went  berserk,  and  charged  into  the

fight.

there in the flinty hills of the ozarks, i
fought  for  the  lives  of  my  dogs.  i  fought
with  the  only  weapon  i  had,  the  sharp
cutting blade of a double-bitted ax.

screaming  like  a  madman,  with  tears
running  down  my  face,  i  hacked  and

chopped at the big snarling mountain cat.

once,  feeling  the  bite  of  the  sharp
blade,  the  devil  cat  turned  on  me.  his
yellow slitted eyes burned with hate. the
long, lithe body dipped low to the ground.
the shoulder muscles knotted and bulged.
i  tried  to  jump  back  but  my  foot  slipped
and i dropped to my knees. i knew i was
trapped.  with  a  terrifying  scream  he
sprang.

i  never  saw  my  dogs  when  they  got
between  the  lion  and  me,  but  they  were
there. side by side, they rose up from the
ground  as  one.  they  sailed  straight  into
those  jaws  of  death,  their  small,  red
bodies  taking  the  ripping,  slashing  claws
meant for me.

i  screamed  and  charged  back  into  the
fight,  swinging  my  ax,  but  i  was  careful

not to hit one of my dogs.

the  battle  raged  on  and  on,  down  the
side  of  the  mountain,  over  huckleberry
bushes,  fallen  logs,  and  rocks.  it  was  a
rolling,  tumbling  mass  of  fighting  fury.  i
was  in  the  middle  of  it  all,  falling,
screaming,  crying  and  hacking  away  at
every opportunity.

i  had  cut  the  big  cat  several  times.
blood showed red on the bit of the ax, but
as  yet  i  had  not  gotten  in  the  fatal  lick.  i
knew it had to be soon for my dogs were
no  match  against  the  razor-sharp  claws
and the long, yellow fangs.

the screams of the big cat and the deep
bellowing  voices  of  my  dogs  echoed
through the mountains as if the demons of
hell had been turned loose. down the side
of the mountain, the terrible fight went on,

down to the very bottom of the canyon.

the big cat had old dan by the throat. i
knew  he  was  seeking  to  cut  the  all-
important  vein,  the  jugular. at  the  pitiful
bawl  of  old  dan,  little  ann,  throwing
caution  to  the  wind,  ran  in  and  sank  her
teeth in the lion’s tough neck.

with  her  claws  digging

the
mountain  soil,  she  braced  herself,  and
started  pulling.  the  muscles  in  her  small
legs knotted and quivered. she was trying
hard to pull the devil cat’s fangs from the
throat of old dan.

into

in  the  rays  of  a  bright  ozark  moon,  i
could see clearly. for an instant i saw the
broad back of the big cat. i saw the knotty
bulge  of  steel-bound  muscle,  the  piston-
like jerk of the deadly hind claws, trying
for
that  could

the  downward  stroke

raising  the  ax  high  over  my  head,  i
brought it down with all the strength in my
body.  my  aim  was  true.  behind  the
shoulders, in the broad muscular back, the
heavy blade sank with a sickening sound.
the  keen  edge  cleaved  through  the  tough
skin. it seemed to hiss as it sliced its way
through bone and gristle.

i  left  the  ax  where  it  was,  sunk  to  the

eye in the back of the devil cat.

disembowel a dog.

he  loosened  his  hold  on  the  throat  of
old dan. with a scream of pain, he reared
up on his hind legs and started pawing the
air. little ann dangled from his neck, still
holding  on.  her  eyes  were  shut  tight  and
her small feet were digging and clawing at
the body.

old dan, spewing blood from a dozen

wounds, leaped high in the air. his long,
red body sailed in between the outspread
paws  of  the  lion.  i  heard  the  snap  of  his
powerful  jaws  as  they  closed  on  the
throat.

the  big  cat  screamed  again.  blood
gurgled and sprayed. in a bright red mist,
it  rained  out  over  the  underbrush  and
rattled like sleet on the white oak leaves.
in a boxer’s stance, he stood and clawed
the air. his slitted eyes turned green with
hate. he seemed to be unaware of the two
hounds  hanging  from  his  body,  and  kept
staring  at  me.  i  stood  in  a  trance  and
stared back at the ghastly scene.

the  breath  of  life  was  slowly  leaving
him. he was dying on his feet but refusing
to  go  down.  my  ax  handle  stuck  straight
out from his back. blood, gushing from the

mortal wound, glistened in the moonlight.
a shudder ran through his body. he tried
once again to scream. blood gurgled in his
throat.

it  was  the  end  of  the  trail  for  the
scourge of the mountains. no more would
he scream his challenge from the rimrocks
to  the  valley  below.  the  small,  harmless
calves and the young colts would be safe
from his silent stalk.

he fell toward me. it seemed that with
his last effort he was still trying to get at
me.

as  his  heavy  body  struck  the  ground,
something exploded in my head. i knew no
more.

when i came to, i was sitting down. it
was silent and still. a bird, disturbed by
the  fight,  started  chirping  far  up  on  the

side  of  the  mountain.  a  small  winter
breeze  rustled  some  dead  leaves  in  the
deep canyon. a cold, crawling chill crept
over my body.

i looked over at the lion. my dogs were
still glued to his lifeless body. in his dying
convulsions the ax had become dislodged
from  the  wound.  it  lay  there  in  the
moonlight, covered with blood.

my  numb  brain  started  working.  i
thought  of  another  time  the  ax  had  been
covered  with  blood.  i  don’t  know  why  i
thought of rubin pritchard at that time, or
why  i  thought  of  these  words  i  had  often
heard: “there is a little good in all evil.”
i  got  to  my  feet  and  went  over  to  my
dogs. i knew i had to inspect them to see
how  badly  they  were  hurt.  it  wasn’t  too
hard to get little ann to loosen her hold. i

examined her body. she was cut in several
places,  but  nothing  fatal.  the  only  bad

it was different with old dan. try as i
might,  he  wouldn’t  turn  loose.  maybe  he
could remember the night in the cave when
he  was  a  pup.  how  the  big  cat  had
screamed and how he had bawled back at
him.

i took hold of his hind legs and tried to
pull  him  loose.  it  was  no  use.  he  knew
that the hold he had was a deadly one and
he wasn’t going to let go. i tried to tell him
it was all over, that the lion was dead, to
turn loose as i wanted to see how badly he
was  hurt.  he  couldn’t  understand  and

wouldn’t  even  open  his  eyes.  he  was
determined  to  hold  on  until  the  body
turned cold and stiff.

with  my  ax  handle,  i  pried  apart  his
locked jaws. holding onto his collar, i led
him  off  to  one  side.  i  couldn’t  turn  him
loose as i knew if i did, he would go back
to the lion.

with one hand i started examining him.
i ran my fingers through the short, red hair.
i could feel the quivering muscles and the
hot, sweaty skin. he was a bloody mess.
his long, velvety ears were shredded. his
entire body was a mass of deep, raw, red
wounds. on both sides of his rib carriage,
the sharp claws had laid the flesh open to
the bone.

his friendly old face was pitiful to see.
a  razor-sharp  claw  had  ripped  down  on

an  angle  across  his  right  eye.  it  was
swollen shut. i wondered if he would ever
see from that eye again.

blood  dripped  from  his  wounds  and
fell on the white oak leaves. i saw he was
bleeding  to  death.  with  tears  running
down  my  cheeks,  i  did  the  only  thing  a
hunter  could  do.  i  raked  the  leaves  away
and  let  his  blood  drip  on  the  black
mountain  soil.  mixing  it  into  a  mud,  i
worked it into his wounds to stop the flow
of blood.

with  my  ax  in  one  hand  and  holding
onto his collar with the other, we climbed
out of the canyon. i knew if i could get him
far enough away from the lion he wouldn’t
go back.

on  reaching  the  top,  i  saw  the  yellow
glow  of  my  lantern.  i  turned  old  dan

loose and walked over and picked it up.

not  knowing  exactly  where  i  was,  i
looked  down  out  of  the  mountains  to  get
my  bearings.  beyond  the  foothills  and
fields i could see the long, white, crooked
line of steam, marking the river’s course.
following  the  snakelike  pattern  with  my
eyes,  in  no  time  i  knew  exactly  where  i
was, for i knew every bend in the river.

as  i  stood  and  watched  him  in  the
moonlight,  my  heart  swelled  with  pride.
wounded  though  he  was,  he  wanted  to

anxious  to  get  home  so  i  could  take
care of my dogs, i turned to call to them.
little ann  was  close  by.  she  was  sitting
down,
in  her
shoulder. i saw the shadowy form of old
dan sniffing around the tree where the lion
had been treed.

make  sure  there  were  no  more  lions
around.

i called to him. in a stiff-legged trot he
came to me. i caught hold of his collar and
gave him another inspection. in the lantern
light  i  could  see  the  mud-caked  wounds
clearly. the bleeding had almost stopped.
i felt much better.

little ann came over. i knelt down and
put my arms around them. i knew that if it
hadn’t been for their loyalty and unselfish
courage  i  would  have  probably  been
killed  by  the  slashing  claws  of  the  devil
cat.

“i  don’t  know  how  i’ll  ever  pay  you
back  for  what  you’ve  done,”  i  said,  “but
i’ll never forget it.”

getting  up,  i  said,  “come  on,  let’s  go
home so i can take care of those wounds.”

i hadn’t gone far when i heard a cry. at
first  i  thought  it  was  a  bird,  or  a  night
hawk. i stood still and listened. i glanced
at little ann. she was looking behind me.
i  turned  around  and  looked  for  old  dan.
he was nowhere in sight.

the  cry  came  again,  low  and  pitiful.
instantly  little ann  started  back  the  way
we had come. i followed as fast as i could
run.

i  found  old  dan  lying  on  his  side,
pleading for help. what i saw was almost
more than i could stand. there, tangled in
the  low  branches  of  a  huckleberry  bush,
were  the  entrails  of  my  dog.  with  a
gasping cry i knelt down by his side.

i knew what had happened. far back in
the  soft  belly,  the  slashing,  razor-sharp
claws of the lion had cut into the hollow.

in  my  inspections  i  had  overlooked  the
wound.  his  entrails  had  worked  out  and
had  become  entangled  in  the  bush.  the
forward motion of his body had done the
rest.

he whimpered as i laid my hand on his
head. a warm, red tongue flicked out at it.
with tears in my eyes, i started talking to
him.  “hang  on,  boy,”  i  said.  “everything
will be all right. i’ll take care of you.”

from

with  trembling  hands,  i  unwound  the
entrails
the  bush.  with  my
handkerchief  i  wiped  away  the  gravel,
leaves, and pine needles. with fingers that
shook, i worked the entrails back into the
wound.

knowing  that  i  couldn’t  carry  him  and
the  ax  and  lantern,  i  stuck  the  ax  deep  in
the side of a white oak tree. i blew out the

lantern and hung the handle over the other
blade.  i  wrapped  my  dog  in  my  old
sheepskin coat and hurried for home.

arriving  home,  i  awakened  my  mother
and  father.  together  we  doctored  my
dogs.  old  dan  was  taken  care  of  first.
very gently mama worked the entrails out
and  in  a  pan  of  warm  soapy  water,
washed  them  clean  of  the  pine  needles,
leaves, and grit.

“if  i  only  knew  what  i  was  doing,”
mama  said,  as  she  worked,  “i’d  feel
better.”

with  gentle  hands,  she  worked  the
entrails  back  through  the  opening.  the
wound was sewn up and bandaged with a
clean white cloth.

little ann wasn’t hard to doctor. i held
her head while mama cleaned her wounds

with  peroxide.  feeling  the  bite  of  the
strong liquid, she whined and licked at my
hands.

“it’s all right, little girl,” i said. “you’ll

be well in no time.”

i  opened  the  door  and  watched  her  as

she limped off to the doghouse.

hearing  a  whimper,  i  turned  around.
there  in  the  doorway  to  the  room  stood
my  sisters.  i  could  tell  by  the  looks  on
their faces that they had been watching for
some  time.  they  looked  pitiful  standing
there  in  their  long  white  gowns.  i  felt
sorry for them.

“will  little  ann  be  all  right?”  my

oldest sister asked.

“yes,”  i  said,  “she’ll  be  all  right.  she
only had one bad wound and we’ve taken
care of that.”

“old  dan’s  hurt  bad,  isn’t  he?”  she

i nodded my head.
“how bad is it?” she asked.
“it’s  bad,”  i  said.  “he  was  cut  wide

“the way your dogs are cut up,” papa

said, “it must have been a terrible fight.”

they all started crying.
“now  here,”  mama  said,  going  over,
“you  girls  get  back  in  bed. you’ll  take  a
death  of  cold  being  up  like  this  in  your
bare feet.”

“mommie,”  the  little  one  said.  “god

won’t let old dan die, will he?”

“i  don’t  think  so,  honey,”  mama  said.

“now off to bed.”

their room.

they turned and walked slowly back to

“it  was,  papa,”  i  said.  “i  never  saw
anything like it. little ann wouldn’t have
fought  the  lion  if  it  hadn’t  been  for  old
dan. all she was doing was helping him.
he  wouldn’t  quit.  he  just  stayed  right  in
there  till  the  end.  i  even  had  to  pry  his
jaws loose from the lion’s throat after the
lion was dead.”

glancing at old dan, papa said, “it’s in
his  blood,  billy.  he’s  a  hunting  hound,
and the best one i ever saw. he only has
two loves—you and hunting. that’s all he
knows.”

i told them how the lion had leaped at
me and how my dogs had gotten between

“if  it  hadn’t  been  for  them,  papa,”  i
said, “i probably wouldn’t be here now.”
“what do you mean,” mama said, “you

wouldn’t be here now?”

him and me.

“they  were  so  close  together,”  i  said,
“when  they  came  up  off  the  ground  they
looked just like one.”

there was a moaning sigh from mama.
she covered her face with her hands and
started crying.

“i  don’t  know,”  she  sobbed,  “i  just
don’t know. to think how close you came
to  being  killed.  i  don’t  think  i  can  stand
any more.”

“now, now,” papa said, as he walked
over and put his arms around her. “don’t
go  all  to  pieces.  it’s  all  over.  let’s  be
thankful and do our best for old dan.”

“do you think he’ll die, papa?” i asked.
“i  don’t  know,  billy,”  papa  said,
shaking his head. “he’s lost an awful lot
of blood and he’s a mighty sick dog. all

our  wait  wasn’t

long.  my  dog’s
breathing grew faster and faster, and there
was a terrible rattling in his throat. i knelt
down and laid his head in my lap.

old  dan  must  have  known  he  was
dying.  just  before  he  drew  one  last  sigh,
and a feeble thump of his tail, his friendly
gray eyes closed forever.

at first i couldn’t believe my dog was
dead.  i  started  talking  to  him.  “please
don’t  die,  dan,”  i  said.  “don’t  leave  me
now.”

we can do now is wait and see.”

i  looked  to  mama  for  help.  her  face
was  as  white  as  the  bark  on  a  sycamore
tree  and  the  hurt  in  her  eyes  tore  at  my
heart.  she  opened  her  mouth  to  say
something but words wouldn’t come out.

feeling as cold as an arctic wind, i got

up  and  stumbled  to  a  chair.  mama  came
over and said something. her words were
only a murmur in my ears.

very gently papa picked old dan up in
his arms and carried him out on the porch.
when he came back in the house, he said,
“well, we did all we could do, but i guess
it wasn’t enough.”

at that moment. i knew she was all right.

i  had  never  seen  my  father  and  mother
look so tired and weary as they did on that
night. i knew they wanted to comfort me,
but didn’t know what to say.

papa tried. “billy,” he said, “i wouldn’t
think  too  much  about  this  if  i  were  you.
it’s not good to hurt like that. i believe i’d
just try to forget it. besides, you still have
little ann.”

i wasn’t even thinking about little ann

“i’m  thankful  that  i  still  have  her,”  i
said, “but how can i forget old dan? he
gave his life for me, that’s what he did—
just laid down his life for me. how can i
ever forget something like that?”

mama  said,  “it’s  been  a  terrible  night
for all of us. let’s go to bed and try to get
some  rest.  maybe  we’ll  all  feel  better
tomorrow.”

“no, mama,” i said. “you and papa go
on to bed. i think i’ll stay up for a while. i
couldn’t sleep anyway.”

mama started to protest, but papa shook
his head. arm in arm they walked from the
room.

long  after  my  mother  and  father  had
retired, i sat by the fire trying to think and
couldn’t. i felt numb all over. i knew my
dog was dead, but i couldn’t believe it. i

didn’t  want  to.  one  day  they  were  both
alive and happy. then that night, just like
that, one of them was dead.

i  didn’t  know  how  long  i  had  been
sitting  there  when  i  heard  a  noise  out  on
the  porch.  i  got  up,  walked  over  to  the
door,  and  listened.  it  came  again,  a  low
whimper and a scratchy sound.

i could think of only one thing that could
have made the noise. it had to be my dog.
he wasn’t dead. he had come back to life.
with a pounding heart, i opened the door
and stepped out on the porch.

what  i  saw  was  more  than  i  could
stand.  the  noise  i  had  heard  had  been
made  by  little ann. all  her  life  she  had
slept by old dan’s side. and although he
was dead, she had left the doghouse, had
come  back  to  the  porch,  and  snuggled  up

close to his side.

she looked up at me and whimpered. i
couldn’t  stand  it.  i  didn’t  know  i  was
running until i tripped and fell. i got to my
feet and ran on and on, down through our
fields  of  shocked  corn,  until  i  fell  face
down  on  the  river’s  bank.  there  in  the
gray shadows of a breaking dawn, i cried
until i could cry no more.

the  churring  of  gray  squirrels  in  the
bright morning sun told me it was daylight.
i  got  to  my  feet  and  walked  back  to  the
house.

coming  up  through  our  barn  lot,  i  saw
my father feeding our stock. he came over
and said, “breakfast is about ready.”

“i  don’t  want  any  breakfast,  papa,”  i
said. “i’m not hungry and i have a job to
do. i’ll have to bury my dog.”

“i  tell  you  what,”  he  said,  “i’m  not
going to be very busy today, so let’s have
a good breakfast and then i’ll help you.”

“no, papa,” i said. “i’ll take care of it.
you go and eat breakfast. tell mama i’m
not hungry.”

i  saw  a  hurt  look  in  my  father’s  eyes.
shaking  his  head,  he  turned  and  walked
away.

from rough pine slabs, i made a box for
my dog. it was a crude box but it was the
best i could do. with strips of burlap and
corn shucks, i padded the inside.

up  on  the  hillside,  at  the  foot  of  a
beautiful  red  oak  tree,  i  dug  his  grave.
there  where  the  wild  mountain  flowers
would grow in the spring, i laid him away.
i  had  a  purpose  in  burying  my  dog  up
there  on  the  hillside.  it  was  a  beautiful

spot. from there one could see the country
for  miles,  the  long  white  crooked  line  of
the  river,  the  tall  thick  timber  of  the
bottoms,  the  sycamore,  birch,  and  box
elder. i thought perhaps that on moonlight
nights old dan would be able to hear the
deep  voices  of  the  hounds  as  they  rolled
out of the river bottoms on the frosty air.

the

after the last shovel of dirt was patted
in place, i sat down and let my mind drift
back through the years. i thought of the old
k.  c.  baking  powder  can,  and  the  first
time i saw my pups in the box at the depot.
i  thought  of  the  fifty  dollars,  the  nickels
and  dimes,  and
fishermen  and
blackberry patches.

i looked at his grave and, with tears in
my eyes, i voiced these words: “you were
worth it, old friend, and a thousand times

over.”

in  my  heart  i  knew  that  there  in  the

grave lay a man’s best friend.

two  days  later,  when  i  came  in  from
the  bottoms  where  my  father  and  i  were
clearing land, my mother said, “billy, you
had better look after your dog. she won’t
eat.”

i  started  looking  for  her.  i  went  to  the
barn,  the  corncrib,  and  looked  under  the
porch. i called her name. it was no use.

i  rounded  up  my  sisters  and  asked  if
they had seen little ann. the youngest one
said  she  had  seen  her  go  down  into  the
garden. i went there, calling her name. she
wouldn’t answer my call.

i was about to give up, and then i saw
her.  she  had  wiggled  her  way  far  back
under  the  thorny  limbs  of  a  blackberry

bush in the corner of the garden. i talked to
her and tried to coax her out. she wouldn’t
budge.  i  got  down  on  my  knees  and
crawled back to her. as i did, she raised
her head and looked at me.

her  eyes  told  the  story.  they  weren’t
the  soft  gray  eyes  i  had  looked  into  so
many  times.  they  were  dull  and  cloudy.
there  was  no  fire,  no  life.  i  couldn’t
understand.

i carried her back to the house. i offered
her food and water. she wouldn’t touch it.
i  noticed  how  lifeless  she  was.  i  thought
perhaps
i  had
overlooked.  i  felt  and  probed  with  my
fingers. i could find nothing.

she  had  a  wound

my  father  came  and  looked  at  her.  he
shook  his  head  and  said,  “billy,  it’s  no
use. the life has gone out of her. she has

he turned and walked away.
i couldn’t believe it. i couldn’t.
with  eggs  and  rich  cream,  i  made  a
liquid. i pried her mouth open and poured
it down. she responded to nothing i did. i
carried  her  to  the  porch,  and  laid  her  in
the same place i had laid the body of old
dan. i covered her with gunny sacks.

all through the night i would get up and
check  on  her.  next  morning  i  took  warm
fresh  milk  and  again  i  opened  her  mouth
and  fed  her.  it  was  a  miserable  day  for
me. at noon it was the same. my dog had
just given up. there was no will to live.

no will to live.”

that  evening  when  i  came  in  from  the
fields,  she  was  gone.  i  hurried  to  my
mother. mama told me she had seen her go
up the hollow from the house, so weak she

could  hardly  stand.  mama  had  watched
her  until  she  had  disappeared  in  the
timber.

i  hurried  up  the  hollow,  calling  her
name. i called and called. i went up to the
head  of  it,  still  calling  her  name  and
praying she would come to me. i climbed
out onto the flats; looking, searching, and
calling. it was no use. my dog was gone.

i  had  a  thought,  a  ray  of  hope.  i  just
knew i’d find her at the grave of old dan.
i hurried there.

i  found  her  lying  on  her  stomach,  her
hind  legs  stretched  out  straight,  and  her
front feet folded back under her chest. she
had laid her head on his grave. i saw the
trail  where  she  had  dragged  herself
through the leaves. the way she lay there,
i thought she was alive. i called her name.

she  made  no  movement.  with  the  last
ounce  of  strength  in  her  body,  she  had
dragged herself to the grave of old dan.

kneeling  down  by  her  side,  i  reached
out  and
touched  her.  there  was  no
response,  no  whimpering  cry  or  friendly
wag of her tail. my little dog was dead.

i laid her head in my lap and with tear-
filled eyes gazed up into the heavens. in a
choking  voice,  i  asked,  “why  did  they
have  to  die?  why  must  i  hurt  so?  what
have i done wrong?”

i  heard  a  noise  behind  me.  it  was  my
mother.  she  sat  down  and  put  her  arm
around me.

“you’ve  done  no  wrong,  billy,”  she
said.  “i  know  this  seems  terrible  and  i
know  how  it  hurts,  but  at  one  time  or
another, everyone suffers. even the good

lord  suffered  while  he  was  here  on
earth.”

“i  know,  mama,”  i  said,  “but  i  can’t
understand.  it  was  bad  enough  when  old
dan died. now little ann is gone. both of
them gone, just like that.”

“billy,  you  haven’t  lost  your  dogs
altogether,”  mama  said.  “you’ll  always
have their memory. besides, you can have
some more dogs.”

i  rebelled  at  this.  “i  don’t  want  any
more  dogs,”  i  said.  “i  won’t  ever  want
another  dog.  they  wouldn’t  be  like  old
dan and little ann.”

“we all feel that way, billy,” she said.
“i  do  especially.  they’ve  fulfilled  a
prayer  that  i  thought  would  never  be
answered.”

“i don’t believe in prayers any more,” i

said.  “i  prayed  for  my  dogs,  and  now
look, both of them are dead.”

mama was silent for a moment; then, in
a gentle voice, she said, “billy, sometimes
it’s hard to believe that things like this can
happen,  but  there’s  always  an  answer.
when  you’re  older,  you’ll  understand
better.”

“no,  i  won’t,”  i  said.  “i  don’t  care  if
i’m  a  hundred  years  old,  i’ll  never
understand why my dogs had to die.”

as  if  she  were  talking  to  someone  far
away,  i  heard  her  say  in  a  low  voice,  “i
don’t  know  what  to  say.  i  can’t  seem  to
find the right words.”

looking  up  to  her  face,  i  saw  that  her

eyes were flooded with tears.

“mama,  please  don’t  cry,”  i  said.  “i

didn’t mean what i said.”

“i  know  you  didn’t,”  she  said,  as  she
squeezed me up tight. “it’s just your way
of fighting back.”

i heard the voice of my father calling to

us from the house.

“come  now,”  mama  said.  “i  have
supper ready and your father wants to talk
to you. i think when you’ve heard what he
has to say, you’ll feel better.”

“i  can’t  leave  little  ann  like  this,
mama,”  i  said.  “it’ll  be  cold  tonight.  i
think i’ll carry her back to the house.”

“no, i don’t think you should do that,”
mama said. “your sisters would go all to
pieces. let’s make her comfortable here.”
raking  some  dead  leaves  into  a  pile,
she  picked  little ann  up  and  laid  her  in
them. taking off my coat, i spread it over
her body. i dreaded to think of what i had

to do on the morrow.

my father and sisters were waiting for
us on the porch. mama told them the sad
story. my sisters broke down and started
crying. they ran to mama and buried their
faces in her long cotton dress.

papa  came  over  and  laid  his  hand  on
my  shoulder.  “billy,”  he  said,  “there  are
times in a boy’s life when he has to stand
up like a man. this is one of those times. i
know what you’re going through and how
it hurts, but there’s always an answer. the
good lord has a reason for everything he
does.”

“there  couldn’t  be  any  reason  for  my
dogs  to  die,  papa,”  i  said.  “there  just
couldn’t.  they  hadn’t  done  anything
wrong.”

papa glanced at mama. getting no help

from  her,  he  said,  “it’s  getting  cold  out
here.  let’s  go  in  the  house.  i  have
something to show you.”

“guess what we’re having for supper,”
mama  said,  as  we  turned  to  enter  the
house. “your favorite, billy, sweet potato
pie. you’ll like that, won’t you?”

i nodded my head, but my heart wasn’t

in it.

papa  didn’t  follow  us  into  the  kitchen.

he turned and entered his bedroom.

when he came into the room, he had a
small  shoe  box  in  his  hand.  i  recognized
the  box  by  the  bright  blue  ribbon  tied
around it. mama kept her valuables in it.

a  silence  settled  over

the  room.
walking to the head of the table, papa set
the  box  down  and  started  untying  the
ribbon.  his  hands  were  trembling  as  he

fumbled with the knot. with the lid off, he
reached  in  and  started  lifting  out  bundles
of money.

after  stacking  them  in  a  neat  pile,  he
raised his head and looked straight at me.
“billy,”  he  said,  “you  know  how  your
mother  has  prayed  that  some  day  we’d
have  enough  money  to  move  out  of  these
hills  and  into  town  so  that  you  children
could get an education.”

i nodded my head.
“well,”  he  said,  in  a  low  voice,
“because  of  your  dogs,  her  prayers  have
been answered. this is the money earned
by old dan and little ann. i’ve managed
to make the farm feed us and clothe us and
i’ve saved every cent your furs brought in.
we now have enough.”

“isn’t  it  wonderful,”  mama  said.  “it’s

just like a miracle.”

“i  think  it  is  a  miracle,”  papa  said.
“remember, billy said a prayer when he
asked  for  his  pups  and  then  there  were
your prayers. billy got his pups. through
those  dogs  your  prayers  were  answered.
yes, i’m sure it is a miracle.”

“if he gave them to me, then why did he

take them away?” i asked.

“i think there’s an answer for that, too,”
papa  said.  “you  see,  billy,  your  mother
and i had decided not to separate you from
your dogs. we knew how much you loved
them. we decided that when we moved to
town  we’d  leave  you  here  with  your
grandpa  for  a  while.  he  needs  help
anyway. but i guess the good lord didn’t
want that to happen. he doesn’t like to see
families  split  up.  that’s  why  they  were

taken away.”

i knew my father was a firm believer in
fate. to him everything that happened was
the will of god, and in his bible he could
always find the answers.

papa  could  see  that  his  talk  had  had
very little effect on me. with a sorrowful
look  on  his  face,  he  sat  down  and  said,
“now let us give thanks for our food and
for all the wonderful things god has done
for  us.  i’ll  say  a  special  prayer  and  ask
him to help billy.”

i barely heard what papa had to say.
during the meal, i could tell that no one
was enjoying the food. as soon as it was
over, i went to my room and lay down on
the bed.

mama  came  in.  “why  don’t  you  go  to
bed,”  she  said,  “and  get  a  good  night’s

sleep. you’ll feel better tomorrow.”

“no, i won’t, mama,” i said. “i’ll have

to bury little ann tomorrow.”

“i  know,”  she  said,  as  she  turned  my
covers  down.  “i’ll  help  if  you  want  me
to.”

“no,  mama,”  i  said,  “i  don’t  want
anyone  to  help.  i’d  rather  do  it  all  by
myself.”

“billy,  you’re  always  doing  things  by
yourself,”  mama  said.  “that’s  not  right.
everyone  needs  help  some  time  in  his
life.”

“i  know,  mama,”  i  said,”  but,  please,
not  this  time.  ever  since  my  dogs  were
puppies,  we’ve  always  been  together—
just  us  three.  we  hunted  together  and
played together. we even went swimming
together.

“did you know, mama, that little ann
used to come every night and peek in my
window  just  to  see  if  i  was  all  right?  i
guess  that’s  why  i  want  to  be  by  myself
when i bury her.”

“now say your prayers and go to sleep.
i’m sure you’ll feel better in the morning.”
i didn’t feel like saying any prayers that
night.  i  was  hurting  too  much.  long  after
the rest of the family had gone to bed, i lay
staring  into  the  darkness,  trying  to  think
and not able to.

some time in the night i got up, tiptoed
to  my  window,  and  looked  out  at  my
doghouse.  it  looked  so  lonely  and  empty
sitting there in the moonlight. i could see
that the door was slightly ajar. i thought of
the  many  times  i  had  lain  in  my  bed  and
listened to the squeaking of the door as my

dogs went in and out. i didn’t know i was
crying  until  i  felt  the  tears  roll  down  my
cheeks.

mama must have heard me get up. she
came  in  and  put  her  arms  around  me.
“billy,”  she  said,  in  a  quavering  voice,
“you’ll just have to stop this. you’re going
to  make  yourself  sick  and  i  don’t  think  i
can stand any more of it.”

after she had tucked me in, she sat on
the bed for a while. as if she were talking
to  the  darkness,  i  heard  her  say,  “if  only
there  were  some  way  i  could  help—

“i  can’t,  mama,”  i  said.  “it  hurts  so
much, i just can’t. i don’t want you to feel
bad just because i do.”

“i can’t help it, billy,” she said. “come
now and get back in bed. i’m afraid you’ll
catch cold.”

something i could do.”

“no one can help, mama,” i said. “no

one can bring my dogs back.”

“i  know,”  she  said,  as  she  got  up  to
there  must  be

something—there just has to be.”

the  room,  “but

after mama had left the room, i buried
my face in my pillow and cried myself to
sleep.

the next morning i made another box. it
was smaller than the first one. each nail i
drove in the rough pine boards caused the
knot in my throat to get bigger and bigger.
my sisters came to help. they stood it
for a while, then with tears streaming, they
ran for the house.

i  buried  little ann  by  the  side  of  old
dan. i knew that was where she wanted to
be.  i  also  buried  a  part  of  my  life  along

with my dog.

to

remembering  a  sandstone  ledge  i  had
seen  while  prowling  the  woods,  i  went
there. i picked out a nice stone and carried
it  back
the  graves.  then,  with
painstaking  care,  i  carved  their  names
deep in its red surface.

as i stood looking at the two graves, i
tried hard to understand some of the things
my  father  had  told  me,  but  i  couldn’t—i
was  still  hurting  and  still  had  that  empty
feeling.

i went to mama and had a talk with her.
“mama,”  i  asked,  “do  you  think  god

made a heaven for all good dogs?”

“yes,” she said, “i’m sure he did.”
“do you think he made a place for dogs
to  hunt?  you  know—just  like  we  have
here  on  our  place—with  mountains  and

sycamore trees, rivers and cornfields, and
old rail fences? do you think he did?”

“from  what  i’ve  read  in  the  good
book,  billy,”  she  said,  “he  put  far  more
things  up  there  than  we  have  here.  yes,
i’m sure he did.”

“i’m  glad,”  she  said,  as  she  patted  my
head. “i don’t like to see my little boy hurt
like this.”

i  was  thinking  this  over  when  mama
came up to me and started tucking my shirt
in. “do you feel better now?” she asked.

“it still hurts, mama,” i said, as i buried
my face in her dress, “but i do feel a little
better.”

the  following  spring  we  left  the  ozarks.  the
day we moved i thought everyone would be
sad,  but  it  was  just  the  opposite.  mama
seemed  to  be  the  happiest  one  of  all.  i
could  hear  her  laughing  and  joking  with
my sisters as they packed things. she had a
glow in her eyes i had never seen before
and it made me feel good.

i  even  noticed  a  change  in  papa.  he
didn’t have that whipped look on his face
any  more.  he  was  in  high  spirits  as  we
carried the furniture out to our wagon.

after  the  last  item  was  stored  in  the
wagon,  papa  helped  mama  to  the  spring
seat and we were ready to go.

“papa,  would  you  mind  waiting  a  few
minutes?”  i  asked.  “i’d  like  to  say  good-
bye to my dogs.”

“sure,”  he  said,  smiling.  “we  have

plenty of time. go right ahead.”

nearing  the  graves,  i  saw  something
different.  it  looked  like  a  wild  bush  had
grown up and practically covered the two
little  mounds.  it  made  me  angry  to  think
that an old bush would dare grow so close
to  the  graves.  i  took  out  my  knife,
intending to cut it down.

when i walked up close enough to see
what it was, i sucked in a mouthful of air
and stopped. i couldn’t believe what i was
seeing.  there  between
the  graves,  a
beautiful red fern had sprung up from the
rich  mountain  soil.  it  was  fully  two  feet
tall  and  its  long  red  leaves  had  reached

out  in  rainbow  arches  curved  over  the
graves of my dogs.

i had heard the old indian legend about
the red fern. how a little indian boy and
girl were lost in a blizzard and had frozen
to  death.  in  the  spring,  when  they  were
found,  a  beautiful  red  fern  had  grown  up
between their two bodies. the story went
on to say that only an angel could plant the
seeds  of  a  red  fern,  and  that  they  never
died;  where  one  grew,  that  spot  was
sacred.

remembering

the
legend,  i  turned  and  started  hollering  for
mama.

the  meaning  of

“what is it, billy? are you all right?”

“mama!  mama!”  i  shouted.  “come

here! and hurry! you won’t believe it.”

in a frightened voice, she shouted back,

“i’m  all  right,  mama,”  i  shouted,  “but

hurry. you just won’t believe it.”

holding  her  long  skirt  in  her  hand  and
with a frightened look on her face, mama
came puffing up the hillside. close behind
her came papa and my sisters.

“what  is  it,  billy?”  mama  asked,  in  a

scared voice. “are you all right?”

“look!” i said, pointing at the red fern.
staring  wide-eyed,  mama  gasped  and
covered her mouth with her hand. i heard
her  say,  almost  in  a  whisper,  “oh-h-h-h,
it’s a red fern—a sacred red fern.”

she  walked  over  and  very  tenderly
started fingering the long red leaves. in an
awed  voice,  she  said,  “all  my  life  i’ve
wanted to see one. now i have. it’s almost
unbelievable.”

“don’t  touch  it,  mama,”  my  oldest

sister  whispered.  “it  was  planted  by  an
angel.”

mama  smiled  and  asked,  “have  you

heard the legend?”

“yes,  mama,”  my

said.
“grandma told me the story, and i believe
it, too.”

sister

with  a  serious  look  on  his  face,  papa
said, “these hills are full of legends. up
until  now  i’ve  never  paid  much  attention
to  them,  but  now  i  don’t  know.  perhaps
there is something to the legend of the red
fern. maybe this is god’s way of helping
billy understand why his dogs died.”

“i’m sure it is, papa,” i said, “and i do
understand.  i  feel  different  now,  and  i
don’t hurt any more.”

“come,” mama said, “let’s go back to
the  wagon.  billy  wants  to  be  alone  with

his dogs for a while.”

just  as  they  turned  to  leave,  i  heard
papa murmur in a low voice, “wonderful
indeed is the work of our lord.”

as i stood looking at the two graves, i
noticed  things  i  hadn’t  seen  before.  wild
violets,  rooster  heads,  and  mountain
daisies  had  completely  covered  the  two
little  mounds.  a  summer  breeze  gushed
down from the rugged hills. i felt its warm
caress as it fanned my face. it hummed a
tune  in  the  underbrush  and  rustled  the
leaves  on  the  huge  red  oak.  the  red  fern
wavered  and  danced  to  the  music  of  the
hills.

taking off my cap, i bowed my head. in
a  choking  voice,  i  said,  “good-bye,  old
dan and little ann. i’ll never forget you;
and  this  i  know—if  god  made  room  in

heaven for all good dogs, i know he made
a special place for you.”

with a heavy heart, i turned and walked
away.  i  knew  that  as  long  as  i  lived  i’d
never  forget  the  two  little  graves  and  the
sacred red fern.

i saw i had left the door to the barn loft

not far from our home, the road wound
its way up and over a hill. at the top papa
stopped  the  team.  we  all  stood  up  and
looked back. it was a beautiful sight, one
i’ll never forget.

as i stood and looked at the home of my
birth, it looked sad and lonely. there was
no spiral of lazy blue smoke twisting from
the  rock  chimney,  no  white  leghorn  hen
chasing  a  june  bug,  no  horse  or  cow
standing  with  head  down  and
tail
switching.

open. a  tuft  of  hay  hung  out.  it  wavered
gently in the warm summer breeze.

something  scurried  across  the  vacant
yard  and  disappeared  under  the  barn.  it
was samie, our house cat. i heard my little
sister  say  in  a  choking  voice,  “mommie,
we forgot samie.”

“see what, mama?” i asked.
“the red fern,” she said.
my  oldest  sister  spoke  up.  “i  can  see

there was no answer.
to  the  left,  i  could  see  our  fields  and
the  zigzag  lines  of  rail  fences.  farther
down,
the  shimmering
whiteness of the tall sycamores. my vision
blurred as tears came to my eyes.

i  could  see

the  sorrowful  silence  was  broken  by
my mother’s voice. she asked, “billy, can
you see it?”

it,” she said.

rubbing  my  eyes,  i  looked  to  the
hillside above our home. there it stood in
all its wild beauty, a waving red banner in
a carpet of green. it seemed to be saying,
“good-bye,  and  don’t  worry,  for  i’ll  be
here always.”

hearing a sniffling, i turned around. my
three  little  sisters  had  started  crying.
mama said something to papa. i heard the
jingle of the trace chains as they tightened
in the singletrees.

our wagon moved on.

i  have  never  been  back  to  the  ozarks.
all  i  have  left  are  my  dreams  and
memories, but if god is willing, some day
i’d

caress the cool white bark of a sycamore.
i’d  like  to  take  a  walk  far  back  in  the
flinty  hills  and  search  for  a  souvenir,  an
old double-bitted ax stuck deep in the side
of a white oak tree. i know the handle has

trails i walked in my boyhood days.

i’d like to see the old home place, the
barn and the rail fences. i’d like to pause
under  the  beautiful  red  oaks  where  my
sisters and i played in our childhood. i’d
like to walk up the hillside to the graves

of my dogs.

i’m sure the red fern has grown and has
completely covered the two little mounds.
i  know  it  is  still  there,  hiding  its  secret
beneath  those  long,  red  leaves,  but  it
wouldn’t be hidden from me for part of my
life is buried there, too.

yes,  i  know  it  is  still  there,  for  in  my
heart i believe the legend of the sacred red
fern.

wilson  rawls  was  born  on  a  small  farm  in  the
oklahoma ozarks. he spent his youth in the heart of the
cherokee nation, prowling the hills and river bottoms with
his only companion, an old bluetick hound. rawls’s first
writing  was  done  with  his  fingers  in  the  dust  of  the
country  roads  and  in  the  sands  along  the  river,  and  his
earliest  stories  were  told  to  his  dog.  not  until  rawls’s
family  moved  to  muskogee  and  he  could  attend  high
school  did  he  encounter  books. where  the  red  fern
grows has become a modern classic and has been made
into a widely acclaimed motion picture.
