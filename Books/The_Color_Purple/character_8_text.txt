reverend mr. 's place. and what was my surprise when a little girl opened the door and she had your eyes set in

your face.

love, nettie


next one said,


dear celie,


i keep thinking it's too soon to look for a letter from you. and i know how busy you is with all mr. ' s children. but i

miss you so much. please write to me, soon as you have a chance. every day i think about you. every minute.

the lady you met in town is name corrine. the little girl's name is olivia. the husband's name is samuel. the little boy's
name is adam. they are sanctified religious and very good to me. they live in a nice house next to the church where
samuel preaches, and we spend a lot of time on church business. i say "we" because they always try to include me in
everything they do, so i don't feel so left out and alone.

but god, i miss you, celie. i think about the time you laid yourself down for me. i love you with all my heart.

your sister, nettie

dear celie,

i asked samuel if he would visit you and mr. , just to see how you are. but he says he can't risk putting himself

between man and wife, especially when he don't know them. and i felt bad for having to ask him, he and corrine have
been so nice to me. but my heart is breaking. it is breaking because i can not find any work in this town, and i will have to
leave. after i leave, what will happen to us? how will we ever know what is going on?

 ashamed you couldn't even talk about it to god, you had to
write it, bad as you thought your writing was. well, now i know what you meant. and whether god will read letters or no,
i know you will go on writing them; which is guidance enough for me. anyway, when i don't write to you i feel as bad as i
do when i don't pray, locked up in myself and choking on my own heart. i am so lonely, celie.

the reason i am in africa is because one of the missionaries that was supposed to go with corrine and samuel to help
with the children and with setting up a school suddenly married a man who was afraid to let her go, and refused to come
to africa with her. so there they were, all set to go, with a ticket suddenly available and no missionary to give it to. at the
same time, i wasn't able to find a job anywhere around town. but i never dreamed of going to africa! i never even
thought about it as a real place, though samuel and corrine and even the children talked about it all the time.

like this at times. but they know a lot more about it than miss beasley or any of our other teachers, and besides, they
spoke of all the good things they could do for the downtrodden people from whom they sprang. people who need christ
and good medical advice.

one day i was in town with corrine and we saw the mayor's wife and her maid. the mayor's wife was shopping— going in
and out of stores— and her maid was waiting for her on the street and taking the packages. i don't know if y

 the mayor's wife. she looks like a wet cat. and there was her maid looking like the very last person in the world
you'd expect to see waiting on anybody, and in particular not on anybody that looked like that.

i spoke. but just speaking to me seemed to make her embarrassed and she suddenly sort of erased herself. it was the
strangest thing, celie! one minute i was saying howdy to a living woman. the next minute nothing living was there. only
its shape.

all that night i thought about it. then samuel and corrine told me what they'd heard about how she got to be the mayor's
maid. that she attacked the mayor, and then the mayor and his wife took her from the prison to work in their home.

in the morning i started asking questions about africa and started reading all the books samuel and corrine have on the
subject.

did you know there were great cities in africa, greater than milledgeville or even atlanta, thousands of years ago? that

more than their own sisters and brothers. how we came to america in ships. how we were made to work.

i hadn't realized i was so ignorant, celie. the little i knew about my own self wouldn't have filled a thimble! and to think
miss beasley always said i was the smartest child she ever taught! but one thing i do thank her for, for teaching me to
learn for myself, by reading and studying and writing a clear hand. and for keeping alive in me somehow the desire to
know. so when corrine and samuel asked me if i would come with them and help them build a school in the middle of
africa, i said yes. but only if they would teach me everything they knew to make me useful as a missionary and someone
they would not be ashamed to call a friend. they agreed to this condition, and my real education began at that time.

they have been as good as their word. and i study everything night and day.

oh, celie, there are colored people in the world who want us to know! want us to grow and see the light!

dear celie,


while we were in town corrine bought cloth to make me two sets of traveling outfits. one olive green and the other gray.
long gored skirts and suit jackets to be worn with white cotton blouses and lace-up boots. she also bought me a woman's
boater with a checkered band.

although i work for corrine and samuel and look after the children, i don't feel like a maid. i guess this is because they
teach me, and i teach the children and there's no beginning or end to teaching and learning and working— it all runs
together.

saying good-bye to our church group was hard. but happy, too. everyone has such high hopes for what can be done in
africa. over the pulpit there is a saying: ethiopia shall stretch forth her hands to god. think what it means that ethiopia
is africa! all the ethiopians in the bible wer

when we got to new york we were tired and dirty. but so excited! listen, celie, new york is a beautiful city. and colored

living in houses that are finer than any white person's house down home. there are more than a hundred churches! and
we went to every one of them. and i stood before each congregation with samuel and corrine and the children and
sometimes our mouths just dropped open from the generosity and goodness of those harlem people's hearts. they live in
such beauty and dignity, celie. and they give and give and then reach down and give some more, when the name "africa"
is mentioned.

they love africa. they defend it at the drop of a hat. and speaking of hats, if we had passed our hats alone they would not
have been enough to hold all the donations to our enterprise. even the children dredged up

is successful because she doesn't "coddle" her charges. she also speaks their language. he is a white man who looks at us
as if we cannot possibly be as good with the africans as this woman is.

my spirits sort of drooped after being at the society. on every wall there was a picture of a white man. somebody called
speke, somebody called livingstone. somebody called daly. or was it stanley? i looked for a picture of the white woman
but didn't see one. samuel looked a little sad too, but then he perked up and reminded us that there is one big advantage
we have. we are not white. we are not europeans. we are black like the africans themselves. and that we and the
africans will be working for a common goal: the uplift of black people everywhere.

of them very nice and with their own anti-slavery & missionary society. the churches in england were also very eager to

homes for tea, and to talk about our work. "tea" to the english is really a picnic indoors. plenty of sandwiches and cookies
and of course hot tea. we all used the same cups and plates.

everyone said i seemed very young to be a missionary, but samuel said that i was very willing, and that, anyway, my
primary duties would be helping with the children and teaching a kindergarten class or two.

our work began to seem somewhat clearer in england because the english have been sending missionaries to africa and

three of them, and a fourth one carried our medical and teaching supplies.

once in the boat we were entertained by the songs of our boatmen as they tried to outpaddle each other to the shore.
they paid very little attention to us or our cargo. when we reached the shore they didn't bother to help us alight from the
boat and actually set some of our supplies right down in the water. as soon as they had browbeat poor samuel out of a
tip that joseph said was too big, they were off hallooing another group of people who were waiting at the edge of the
water to be taken to the ship.

the port is pretty, but too shallow for large ships to use. so there is a good business for the boatmen, during the season
the ships come by. these boatmen were all considerably larger and more muscular than joseph, though all of them,
including joseph, are a deep chocolate brown. not black, like the senegalese. and celie, they all have t

ey moved up a little
bit— nobody saying a word yet— and touched our hair. then looked down at our shoes. we looked at joseph. then he
told us they were acting this way because the missionaries before us were white people, and vice versa. the men had
been to the port, some of them, and had seen the white merchant, so they knew white men could be something else too.
but the women had never been to the port and the only white person they'd seen was the missionary they had buried a


year ago.

samuel asked if they'd ever seen the white woman missionary twenty miles farther on, and he said no. twenty miles
through the jungle is a very long trip. the men might hunt up to ten miles around the village, but the women stayed close
to their huts and fields.

then one of the women asked a question. we looked at joseph. he said the woman wanted to know if the children
belonged to me or to corrine or to both of us. joseph said they belonged to corrine. the woman looked us both over, and

then another woman had a question. she wanted to know if i was also samuel's wife.

joseph said no, that i was a missionary just like samuel and corrine. then someone said they never suspected
missionaries could have children. then another said he never dreamed missionaries could be black.

then someone said. that the new missionaries would be black and two of them women was exactly what he had
dreamed, and just last night, too.

by now there was a lot of commotion. little heads began to pop from behind mothers' skirts and over big sisters'
shoulders. and we were sort of swept along among the villagers, about three hundred of them,

but with a leaf roof, where we all sat down on the ground, men in front, women and children behind. then there was
loud whispering among some very old men who looked like the church elders back home— with their baggy trousers and
shiny, ill-fitting coats— did black missionaries drink palm wine?

corrine looked at samuel and samuel looked at corrine. but me and the children were already drinking it, because
someone had already put the little brown clay glasses in our hands and we were too nervous not to start sipping.

we got there around four o'clock, and sat under the leaf canopy until nine. we had our first meal there, a chicken and
groundnut (peanut) stew which we ate with our fingers. but mostly we listened to songs and watched dances that raised
lots of dust.

the insects, for instance. for some reason, all of her bites turn into deep, runny sores, and she has a lot of trouble
sleeping at night because the noises from the forest frighten her. it is taking a long time for her to become used to the
food, which is nourishing but, for the most part, indifferently prepared. the women of the village take turns cooking for
us, and some are cleaner and more conscientious than others. olivia gets sick from the food prepared by any of the
chief's wives. samuel thinks it may be the water they use, which comes from a separate spring that runs clear even in the
dry season. but the rest of us have no ill effects. it is as if olivia fears the food from these wives because they all look so
unhappy and work so hard. whenever they see her they talk about the day when she will become their littlest sister/wife.
it is just a joke, and they like her, but i wish they wouldn't say it. even though they are unhappy and work like donkeys

one another brother and sister, all the time. some of them can't seem to get it through their thick skulls that you are not
samuel's other wife. i don't like it, she said.

almost since the day we arrived i've noticed a change in corrine. she isn't sick. she works as hard as ever. she is still
sweet and good-natured. but sometimes i sense her spirit is being tested and that something in her is not at rest.

that's fine, i said. i'm glad you brought it up.

tashi's mother and father were just here. they are upset because she spends so much time with olivia. she is changing,
becoming quiet and too thoughtful, they say. she is becoming someone else; her face is beginning to show the spirit of

chosen for her. refused to bow

are from a different tribe some distance to the north and nearer the coast, and their
language is somewhat different. i don't understand it, anyway, though the people of olinka seem to. but they are clever
people about most things, and understand new things very quickly.

it is hard to believe we've been here five years. time moves slowly, but passes quickly. adam and olivia are nearly as tall
as me and doing very well in all their studies. adam has a special aptitude for figures and it worries samuel that soon he
will have nothing more to teach him in this field, having exhausted his own knowledge.

when we were in england we met missionaries who sent their children back home when it was no longer possible to
teach them in the bush. but it is hard to imagine life here without the children. they love the open feeling of the village,
and love living in huts. they are excited by the hunting expertise of the men and the self-sufficiency of the women in
raising their crops. no matter how down i

may be, and sometimes i get very down indeed, a hug from olivia or adam
completely restores me to the level of functioning, if nothing else. their mother and i are not as close as we once were,
but i feel more like their aunt than ever. and the three of us look more and more alike every day.

about a month ago, corrine asked me not to invite samuel to my hut unless she were present. she said it gave the
villagers the wrong idea. this was a real blow to me because i treasure his company. since corrine almost never visits me
herself i will have hardly anybody to talk to, just in friendship. but the children still come and sometimes spend the night
when their parents want to be alone. i love those times. we roast groundnuts on my stove, sit on the floor and study
maps of all the countries in the world. sometimes tashi comes over and tells st

 how tashi's
people's stories got to america, which fascinated tashi. she cried when olivia told how her grandmother had been
treated as a slave.

no one else in this village wants to hear about slavery, however. they acknowledge no responsibility whatsoever. this is
one thing about them that i definitely do not like.

we lost tashi's father during the last rainy season. he fell ill with malaria and nothing the healer concocted saved him. he
refused to take the medicine we use for it, or to let samuel visit him at all. it was my first olinka funeral. the women paint
their faces white and wear white shroudlike garments and cry in a high keening voice. they wrapped the body in
barkcloth and buried it under a big tree in the forest. tashi was heartbroken. all her young life she has tried to please her
father, never quite realizing that, as a girl, she never could. but the death brought her and her mother closer together,
and now catherine feels like one of us. by one of us i mean me and the chi

ldren and sometimes samuel. she is still in
mourning and sticking close to her hut, but she says she will not marry again (since she already has five boy children she
can now do whatever she wants. she has become an honorary man) and when i went to visit her she made it very clear
that tashi must continue to learn. she is the most industrious of all tashi's father's widows, and her fields are praised for
their cleanliness, productivity and general attractiveness. perhaps i can help her with her work. it is in work that t

women get to know and care about each other. it was through work that catherine became friends with her husband's
other wives.

this friendship among women is something samuel often talks about. because the women share a husband but the
husband does not share their friendships, it makes samuel uneasy. it is confusing, i suppose. and it is samuel's duty as a
christian minister to preach the bible's directive of one husband and one wife. samuel is confused because to him, since
the women are friends and will do anything for one another— not always, but more often than anyone from america
would expect— and since they giggle and gossip and nurse each other's children, then they must be happy with things as
they are. but many of the women rarely spend time with their husbands. some of them were promised to old or middle-
aged men at birth. their lives always center around work and their children and other women (since a woman cannot

iend without the worst kind of ostracism and gossip). they indulge their husbands, if anything.
you should just see how they make admiration over them. praise their smallest accomplishments. stuff them with palm
wine and sweets. no wonder the men are often childish. and a grown child is a dangerous thing, especially since, among
the olinka, the husband has life and death power over the wife. if he accuses one of his wives of witchcraft or infidelity,
she can be killed.

thank god (and sometimes samuel's intervention) this has not happened since we've been here. but the stories tashi
tells are often about such gruesome events that happened in the recent past. and god forbid that the child of a favorite
wife should fall ill! that is the point at which even the women's friendships break down, as each woman fears the
accusation of sorcery from the other, or from the husband.

and that's worried you all this time? i tried to laugh it off
but she just looked at me.

when did you first meet my husband? she wanted to know.

and that was when i knew what she thought. she thinks adam and olivia are my children, and that samuel is their father!
oh, celie, this thing has been gnawing away at her all these years!

i met samuel the same day i met you, corrine, i said. (i still haven't got the hang of saying "sister" all the time.) as god is
my witness, that's the truth.

bring the bible, she said.

i brought the bible, and placed my hand on it, and swore.

them near her, which they don't understand. how could they? they don't even know they were adopted.

dear celie,


guess what? samuel thought the children were mine too! that is why he urged me to come to africa with them. when i
showed up at their house he thought i was following my children, and, soft-hearted as he is, didn't have the heart to turn
me away.

if they are not yours, he said, whose are they?

but i had some questions for him, first.

where did you get them? i asked. and celie, he told me a story that made my hair stand on end. i hope you, poor thing,
are ready for it.

and her children; in a short while, they were married. almost at once she was pregnant a third time, though her mental
health was no better. every year thereafter, she was pregnant, every year she became weaker and more mentally
unstable, until, many years after she married the stranger, she died.

two years before she died she had a baby girl that she was too sick to keep. then a baby boy. these children were named
olivia and adam.

this is samuel's story, almost word for word.

the stranger who married the widow was someone samuel had run with long before he found christ. when the man
showed up at samuel's house with first olivia and then adam, samuel felt not only unable to refuse the children, but as if
god had answered his and corrine's prayers.

he never told corrine about the man or about the children's "mother" because he hadn't wanted any sadness to cloud
her happiness.

my family back home very large and poor, and it was time for me to get out and earn my own living.

tears had soaked my blouse when samuel finished telling me all this. i couldn't begin, then, to tell him the truth. but

i woke up this morning bound to tell corrine and samuel everything. i went over to their hut and pulled up a stool next to
corrine's bed. she's so weak by now that all she can do is look unfriendly— and i could tell i wasn't welcome.

i said, corrine, i'm here to tell you and samuel the truth.

she said, samuel already told me. if the children yours, why didn't you just say so?

samuel said. now, honey.

that it keeps a little pot, like all the women have here.

you and samuel telling so many lies, who can believe anything you say? she asked.

you've got to believe nettie, said samuel. though the part about you and pa was a real shock to him.

then i remembered what you told me about seeing corrine and samuel and olivia in town, when she was buying cloth to
make her and olivia dresses, and how you sent me to her because she was the only woman you'd ever seen with money. i
tried to make corrine remember that day, but she couldn't.

she gets weaker and weaker, and unless she can believe us and start to feel something for her children, i fear we will lose

think about was how the clerk treated me! i was acting like somebody because i was samuel's wife, and a spelman
seminary graduate, and he treated me like any ordinary nigger. oh, my feelings were hurt! and i was mad! and that's
what i thought about, even told samuel about, on the way home. not about your sister— what was her name?— celie?
nothing about her.

she began to cry in earnest. me and samuel holding her hands.

don't cry. don't cry, i said. my sister was glad to see olivia with you. glad to see her alive. she thought both her children
were dead.

poor thing! said samuel

your sister in sorrow, nettie


dearest celie,


just when i think i've learned to live with the heat, the constant dampness, even steaminess of my clothes, the
swampiness under my arms and between my legs, my friend comes. and cramps and aches and pains— but i must still
keep going as if nothing is happening, or be an embarrassment to samuel, the children and myself. not to mention the
villagers, who think women who have their friends should not even be

 right.

we buried corrine in the olinka way, wrapped in barkcloth under a large tree. all of her sweet ways went with her. all of
her education and a heart intent on doing good. she taught me so much! i know i will miss her always. the children were
stunned by their mother's death. they knew she was very sick, but death is not something they think about in relation to
their parents or themselves. it was a strange little procession. all of us in our white robes and with our faces painted
white. samuel is like someone lost. i don't believe they've spent a night apart since their marriage.

and how are you? dear sister. the years have come and gone without a single word from you. only the sky above us do
we hold in common. i look at it often as if, somehow, reflected from its immensities, i will one day find myself gazing into
your eyes. your dear, large, clean and beautiful eyes. oh, celie! my life here is nothing but work, work, work, and worry.
what girlhood i might have had passed me by. a

family— this village, which has fallen on such hard times.

now the engineers have come to inspect the territory. two white men came yesterday and spent a couple of hours
strolling about the village, mainly looking at the wells. such is the innate politeness of the olinka that they rushed about
preparing food for them, though precious little is left, since many of the gardens that flourish at t

been destroyed. and the white men sat eating as if the food was beneath notice.

it is understood by the olinka that nothing good is likely to come from the same persons who destroyed their houses, but
custom dies hard. i did not speak to the men myself, but samuel did. he said their talk was all of workers, kilometers of
land, rainfall, seedlings, machinery, and whatnot. one seemed totally indifferent to the people around him— simply
eating and then smoking and staring off into the distance— and the other, somewhat younger, appeared to be
enthusiastic about learning the language. before, he says, it dies out.

i did not enjoy watching samuel speaking to either of them. the one who hung on every word, or the one who looked
through samuel's head.

her saying we should stop wearing each other's clothes. and the memory pained me.

are you sure sister corrine would want this? i asked samuel.

yes, sister nettie, he said. try not to hold her fears against her. at the end she understood, and believed. and
forgave— whatever there was to forgive.

i should have said something sooner, i said.

dearest celie,


by now i expected to be home. looking into your face and saying celie, is it really you? i try to picture what the years have
brought you in the way of weight and wrinkles— or how you fix your hair. from a skinny, hard little something i've
become quite plump. and some of my hair is gray!

but samuel tells me he loves me plump and graying.

does this surprise you?

we were married last fall in england where we tried to get relief for the olinka from the churches and the missionary
society.

as long as they could, the olinka ignored the road and the white builders who came. but eventually they had to notice
them because one of the first things the builders did was tell the people they must be moved elsewhere. the builders
wanted the village site as headquarters for the rubber plantation. it

ered by their god, roofleaf, the builders left these barracks uncovered. then they proceeded to plow
under the olinka village and everything else for miles around. including every last stalk of roofleaf.

after nearly unbearable weeks in the hot sun, we were awakened one morning by the sound of a large truck pulling into
the compound. it was loaded with sheets of corrugated tin.

celie, we had to pay for the tin. which exhausted what meager savings the olinka had, and nearly wiped out the money
samuel and i had managed to put by for the education of the children once we return home. which we have planned to
do each year since corrine died, only to find ourselves more and more involved in the olinka's problems. nothing could
be uglier than corrugated tin, celie. and as they struggled to put up roofs of this cold, hard, glittery, ugly metal the
women raised a deafening ululation of sorrow that echoed off the cavern walls for miles around. it was on this day that
the olinka acknowledged at leas

t temporary defeat.

though the olinka no longer ask anything of us, beyond teaching their children— because they can see how powerless we
and our god are— samuel and i decided we must do something about this latest outrage, even as many of the people to
whom we felt close ran away to join the mbeles or forest people, who live deep in the jungle, refusing to work for whites
or be ruled by them.

so off we went, with the children, to england.

it was an incredible voyage, celie, not only because we had almost forgot about the rest of the world, and such things as
ships and coal fires and streetlights and oatmeal, but because on the ship with us was the wh

tropics most of my life. but, she said, a big war is coming. bigger than the one they were starting when i left. it'll go hard
on england, but i expect we'll survive. i missed the other war, she said. i mean to be present for this one.

samuel and i had never really thought about war.

why, she said, the signs are all over africa. india too, i expect. first there's a road built to where you keep your goods.
then your trees are hauled off to make ships and captain's furniture. then your land is planted with something you can't
eat. then you're forced to work it. that's happening all over africa, she said. burma too, i expect.

een unusually glum during this trip. interested and excited, but not really
sunny, except when he's with young harold.

i will have to ask olivia what's wrong. she is thrilled at the thought of going back to england. her mother used to tell her
about the thatched cottages of the english and how they reminded her of the roofleaf huts of the olinka. they are square,
though, she'd say. more like our church and school than like our homes, which olivia thought very strange.

when we reached england, samuel and i presented the olinka's grievances to the bishop of the english branch of our
church, a youngish man wearing spectacles who sat thumbing through a stack of samuel's yearly reports. instead of even
mentioning the olinka the bishop wanted to know how long it had been since corrine's death, and why, as soon as she
died, i had not returned to america.

i really did not understand what he was driving at.

appearances, miss , he said. appearances. what must the natives think?

about what? i aske

d.

come, come, he said.


we behave as brother and sister to each other, said samuel.

the bishop smirked. yes, he did.

i felt my face go hot.

well, there was more of this, but why burden you with it? you know what some people are, and the bishop was one of
them. samuel and i left without even a word about the olinka's problems.

samuel was so angry, i was frightened. he said the only thing for us to do, if we wanted to remain in africa, was join the
mbeles and encourage all the olinka to do the same.

but suppose they do not want to go? i asked. many of them are too old to move back into the forest. many are sick. the
women have small babies. and then there are the youngsters who want bicycles and british clothes. mirrors and shiny
cooking pots. they want to work for the white people in order to have these things.

to be a poor man's month in
england. but it was a very good time for us. we began to feel ourselves a family, without corrine. and people meeting us
on the street never failed (if they spoke to us at all) to express the sentiment that the children looked just like the two of
us. the children began to accept this as natural, and began going out to view the sights that interested them, alone.
leaving their father and me to our quieter, more sedate pleasures, one of which was simple conversation.

samuel, of course, was born in the north, in new york, and grew up and was educated there. he met corrine through his
aunt who had been a missionary, along with corrine's aunt, in the belgian congo. samuel frequently accompanied his
aunt althea to atlanta, where corrine's aunt theodosia lived.

these two ladies had been through marvelous things together, said samuel, laughing. they'd been attacked by lions,
stampeded by elephants, flooded out by rains, made war on by "natives." the tales they told wer
 
 ___________________________
 
t most did not. if they thought about it at all (and
it became harder to think about indians because there were none around) they thought they were yellow or reddish
brown and wavy haired because of white ancestors, not indian.

even corrine thought this, he said. and yet, i always felt her indianness. she was so quiet. so reflective. and she could
erase herself, her spirit, with a swiftness that truly startled, when she knew the people around her could not respect it.

it did not seem hard for samuel to talk about corrine while we were in england. it wasn't hard for me to listen.

it all seems so improbable, he said. here i am, an aging man whose dreams of helping people have been just that, dreams.


how corrine and i as children would have laughed at ourselves, twenty years a fool of the west, or mouth and roofleaf disease:
a treatise on the futility of the tropics. etc. etc. we failed so utterly, he said. we became as comical as althea and theodosia.
i think her awareness of this fueled 
 
 ___________________________
 
corrine's sickness. she was far more intuitive than i. her gift for understanding people
much greater. she used to say the olinka resented us, but i wouldn't see it. but they do, you know.

no, i said, it isn't resentment, exactly. it really is indifference. sometimes i feel our position is like that of flies on an
elephant's hide.

i remember once, before corrine and i were married, samuel continued. aunt theodosia had one of her at-homes. she
had them every thursday. she'd invited a lot of "serious young people" as she called them, and one of them was a young
harvard scholar named edward. duboyce was his last name, i think. anyhow, aunt theodosia was going on about her
african adventures, leading up to the time king leopold of belgium presented her with a medal. well edward, or perhaps
his name was bill, was a very impatient sort. you saw it in his eyes, you could see it in the 
 
 ___________________________
 
e it a second time.

madame, he said, when aunt theodosia finished her story and flashed her famous medal around the room, do you realize
king leopold cut the hands off workers who, in the opinion of his plantation overseers, did not fulfill their rubber quota?
rather than cherish that medal, madame, you should regard it as a symbol of your unwitting complicity with this despot
who worked to death and brutalized and eventually exterminated thousands and thousands of african peoples.

well, said samuel, silence struck the gathering like a blight. poor aunt theodosia! there's something in all of us that
wants a medal for what we have done. that wants to be appreciated. and africans certainly don't deal in medals. they
hardly seem to care whether missionaries exist.

don't be bitter, i said.

how can i not? he said.

the africans never asked us to come, you know. there's no use blaming them if we feel unwelcome.

it's worse than unwelcome, said samuel. the africans don't even see us. they don't

 even recognize us as the brothers
and sisters they sold.

oh, samuel, i said. don't.

but you know, he had started to cry. oh nettie, he said. that's the heart of it, don't you see. we love them. we try every
way we can to show that love. but they reject us. they never even listen to how we've suffered. and if they listen they say
stupid things. why don't you speak our language? they ask. why can't you remember the old ways? why aren't you
happy in america, if everyone there drives motorcars?

celie, it seemed as good a time as any to put my arms around him. whi

ch i did. and words long buried in my heart crept
to my lips. i stroked his dear head and face and i called him darling and dear. and i'm afraid, dear, dear celie, that concern
and passion soon ran away with us.

i hope when you receive this news of your sister's forward behavior you will not be shocked or inclined to judge me
harshly. especially when i tell you what a total joy it was. i was transported by ecstasy in samuel's arms.

you may have guessed that i loved him all along; but i did not know it. oh, i loved him as a brother and respected him as a
friend, but celie, i love him bodily, as a man\ i love his walk, his size, his shape, his smell, the kinkiness of his hair. i love
the very texture of his palms. the pink of his inner lip. i love his big nose. i love his brows. i love his feet. and i love his
dear eyes in which the vulnerability and beauty of his soul can be plainly read.

nge in us immediately. i'm afraid, my dear, we were radiant.

we love each other dearly, samuel told them, with his arm around me. we intend to marry.

but before we do, i said, i must tell you something about my life and about corrine and about someone else. and it was
then i told them about you, celie. and about their mother corrine's love of them. and about being their aunt.

but where is this other woman, your sister? asked olivia.

i explained your marriage to mr. as best i could.

adam was instantly alarmed. he is a very sensitive soul who hears what isn't said as clearly as what is

.

we will go back to america soon, said samuel to reassure him, and see about her.

the children stood up with us in a simple church ceremony in london. and it was that night, after the wedding dinner,
when we were all getting ready for bed, that olivia told me what has been troubling her brother. he is missing tashi.

but he's also very angry with her, she said, because when we left, she was planning to scar her face.

i didn't know this. one of the things we thought we'd helped stop was the scarring or cutting of tribal marks on the faces

ck home, said olivia. adam isn't the only one who misses tashi.

she kissed me and her father good night. adam soon came in to do the same.

mama nettie, he said, sitting on the bed next to me, how do you know when you really love someone?

sometimes you don't know, i said.

he is a beautiful young man, celie. tall and broad-shouldered, with a deep, thoughtful voice. did i tell you he writes
verses? and loves to sing? he's a son to make you proud.

your loving sister, nettie


p.s. your brother samuel sends his love as well.


dearest celie,


when we returned home everyone seemed happy to see us. when we told them our appeal to the church and the
missionary society failed, they were disappointed. they literally wiped the smiles off their faces along with the sweat, and
returned, dejected, to their barracks. we went on to our building, a combination church, house and school, and began to
unpack our things.

the children... i realize i shouldn't call them children, they're grown, went in sear

e most appalling conditions. we provide antiseptics
and cotton and a place for the children to cry and nurse their wounds.

each day adam presses us to leave for home. he can no longer bear living as we do. there aren't even any trees near us,
just giant boulders and smaller rocks. and more and more of his companions are running away. the real reason, of
course, is he can no longer bear his conflicting feelings about tashi, who is beginning, i think, to appreciate the magnitude
of her mistake.

samuel and i are truly happy, celie. and so grateful to god that we are! we still keep a school for the littlest children;
those eight and over are already workers in the fields. in order to pay rent for the barracks, taxes on the land, and to buy
water and wood and food, everyone must work. so, we teach the young ones, babysit the babies, look after the old and
sick, and attend birthing mothers. our days are fuller than ever, our sojourn in england already a dream. but all things
look brighter becaus

dearest celie,


tashi and her mother have run away. they have gone to join the mbeles. samuel and the children and i were discussing it
just yesterday, and we realized we do not even know for sure the mbeles exist. all we know is that they are said to live
deep in the forest, that they welcome runaways, and that they harass the white man's plantations and plan his
destruction— or at least for his removal from their continent.

adam and olivia are heartbroken because they love tashi and miss her, and because no one who has gone to join the
mbeles ever returned. we try to keep them busy

powdered goods, the planters destroyed what makes them resistant to malaria. of course they did not know this, they
only wanted to take the land for rubber, but the olinka have been eating yams to prevent malaria and to control chronic
blood disease for thousands and thousands of years. left without a sufficient supply of yams, the people— what's left of
them— are sickening and dying at an alarming rate.

to tell you the truth, i fear for our own health, and especially for the children. but samuel feels we will probably be all
right, having had bouts with malaria during the first years we were here.

and how are you, dearest sister? nearly thirty years have passed without a word between us. for all i know you may be
dead. as the time nears for us to come home, adam and olivia ask endless questions about you, few of which i can
answer. sometimes i tell them tashi reminds me of you. and, because there is no one finer to them than tashi, they glow
with delight. but will you still have tashi

's honest and open spirit, i wonder, when we see you again? or will years of

childbearing and abuse from mr. have destroyed it? these are thoughts i don't pursue with the children, only with

my beloved companion, samuel, who advises me not to worry, to trust in god, and to have faith in the sturdiness of my
sister's soul.

god is different to us now, after all these years in africa. more spirit than ever before, and more internal. most people
think he has to look like something or someone— a roofleaf or christ— but we don't. and not being tied to what god looks
like, frees us.

when we return to america we must have long talks about this, celie. and perhaps samuel and i will found a new church

d response to the scarification. and to forgive the repugnance
he'd felt about the female initiation ceremony. he assured tashi that it was she he loved and that in america she would
have country, people, parents, sister, husband, brother and lover, and that whatever befell her in america would also be
his own choice and his own lot.

oh, celie.

so, the next day, our boy came to us with scars identical to tashi's on his cheeks.

and they are so happy. so happy, celie. tashi and adam omatangu.

samuel married them, of course, and all the people left in the compound came to wish them happiness and an
abundance of roofleaf forever. olivia stood up with the bride and a friend of adam's— a man too old to have joined the
mbeles — stood up with him. immediately after the wedding we left the compound, riding in a lorry that took us to a boat
at the coast inlet that flows out to sea.

in a few weeks, we will all be home.

dear nettie,


mr. talk to shug a lot lately

 by the drive look up at us. they look at the house. the yard. shug and albert's cars. they look round
at the fields. then they commence to walk real slow up the walk to the house.

i'm so scared i don't know what to do. feel like my mind stuck. i try to speak, nothing come. try to git up, almost fall.
shug reach down and give me a helping hand. albert press me on the arm.

when nettie's foot come down on the porch i almost die. i stand swaying, tween albert and shug. nettie stand swaying

to do when us was babies. then us feel so weak when us touch, us knock each other down. but what us care? us sit and
lay there on the porch inside each other's arms.

after while, she say celie.
