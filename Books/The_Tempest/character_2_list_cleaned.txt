[CHARACTER] - 
                prospero's
spirit helper. [CHARACTER] is referred to throughout this sparknote and
in most criticism as "he," but his gender and physical form are
ambiguous. rescued by prospero from a long imprisonment at the hands
of the witch sycorax, [CHARACTER] is prospero's servant until prospero
decides to release him. he is mischievous and ubiquitous, able to
traverse the length of the island in an instant and to change shapes
at will. he carries out virtually every task that prospero needs
accomplished in the play.
