  lucentio. tranio, since for the great desire i had
    to see fair padua, nursery of arts,
    i am arriv'd for fruitful lombardy,
    the pleasant garden of great italy,
    and by my father's love and leave am arm'd
    with his good will and thy good company,
    my trusty servant well approv'd in all,
    here let us breathe, and haply institute
    a course of learning and ingenious studies.

    to deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds.
    and therefore, tranio, for the time i study,
    virtue and that part of philosophy
    will i apply that treats of happiness
    by virtue specially to be achiev'd.
    tell me thy mind; for i have pisa left

    a shallow plash to plunge him in the deep,
    and with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.

    or so devote to aristotle's checks
    as ovid be an outcast quite abjur'd.
    balk logic with acquaintance that you have,
    and practise rhetoric in your common talk;
    music and poesy use to quicken you;
    the mathematics and the metaphysics,
    fall to them as you find your stomach serves you.
    no profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en;
    in brief, sir, study what you most affect.
  lucentio. gramercies, tranio, well dost thou advise.
    if, biondello, thou wert come ashore,
    we could at once put us in readiness,
    and take a lodging fit to entertain
    such friends as time in padua shall beget.

  hortensio. mates, maid! how mean you that? no mates for you,
    unless you were of gentler, milder mould.
  katherina. i' faith, sir, you shall never need to fear;
    iwis it is not halfway to her heart;
    but if it were, doubt not her care should be
    to comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool,
    and paint your face, and use you like a fool.
  hortensio. from all such devils, good lord deliver us!
  gremio. and me, too, good lord!
  tranio. husht, master! here's some good pastime toward;
    that wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.

    maid's mild behaviour and sobriety.

  baptista. gentlemen, that i may soon make good
    what i have said- bianca, get you in;

    baptista's eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest
free
    for a husband, and then have to't afresh. sweet bianca! happy
man
    be his dole! he that runs fastest gets the ring. how say you,
    signior gremio?
  gremio. i am agreed; and would i had given him the best horse
in
    padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her, wed
her,
    and bed her, and rid the house of her! come on.
                                     exeunt gremio and hortensio
  tranio. i pray, sir, tell me, is it possible
    that love should of a sudden take such hold?
  lucentio. o tranio, till i found it to be true,
    i never thought it possible or likely.
    but see! while idly i stood looking on,
    i found the effect of love in idleness;
    and now in plainness do confess to thee,
    that art to me as secret and as dear
    as anna to the queen of carthage was-
    tranio, i burn, i pine, i perish, tranio,
    if i achieve not this young modest girl.

   counsel me, tranio, for i know thou canst;
    assist me, tranio, for i know thou wilt.
  tranio. master, it is no time to chide you now;
    affection is not rated from the heart;
    if love have touch'd you, nought remains but so:
    'redime te captum quam queas minimo.'
  lucentio. gramercies, lad. go forward; this contents;
    the rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.
  tranio. master, you look'd so longly on the maid.
    perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.
  lucentio. o, yes, i saw sweet beauty in her face,
    such as the daughter of agenor had,
    that made great jove to humble him to her hand,
    when with his knees he kiss'd the cretan strand.
  tranio. saw you no more? mark'd you not how her sister
    began to scold and raise up such a storm
    that mortal ears might hardly endure the din?
  lucentio. tranio, i saw her coral lips to mov

    and with her breath she did perfume the air;
    sacred and sweet was all i saw in her.
  tranio. nay, then 'tis time to stir him from his trance.
    i pray, awake, sir. if you love the maid,
    bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. thus it stands:
    her elder sister is so curst and shrewd
    that, till the father rid his hands of her,
    master, your love must live a maid at home;
    and therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
    because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.
  lucentio. ah, tranio, what a cruel father's he!
    but art thou not advis'd he took some care

    to get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?
  tranio. ay, marry, am i, sir, and now 'tis plotted.
  lucentio. i have it, tranio.
  tranio. master, for my hand,
    both our inventions meet and jump in one.
  lucentio. tell me thine first.
  tranio. you will be schoolmaster,
    and undertake the teaching of the maid-
    that's your device.
  lucentio. it is. may it be done?
  tranio. not possible; for who shall bear your part
    and be in padua here vincentio's son;
    keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
    visit his countrymen, and banquet them?
  lucentio. basta, content thee, for i have it full.
    we have not yet been seen in any house,
    nor can we be distinguish'd by our faces
    for man or master. then it follows thus:
    thou shalt be master, tranio, in my stead,
    keep house and port and servants, as i should;

    for so your father charg'd me at our parting:

  biondello. where have i been! nay, how now! where are you?
    master, has my fellow tranio stol'n your clothes?
    or you stol'n his? or both? pray, what's the news?
  lucentio. sirrah, come hither; 'tis no time to jest,
    and therefore frame your manners to the time.
    your fellow tranio here, to save my life,
    puts my apparel and my count'nance on,
    and i for my escape have put on his;
    for in a quarrel since i came ashore
    i kill'd a man, and fear i was descried.
    wait you on him, i charge you, as becomes,
    while i make way from hence to save my life.
    you understand me?
  biondello. i, sir? ne'er a whit.
  lucentio. and not a jot of tranio in your mouth:
    tranio is chang'd into lucentio.

    you use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies.
    when i am alone, why, then i am tranio;
    but in all places else your master lucentio.
  lucentio. tranio, let's go.

    this gentleman is happily arriv'd,

  hortensio. sir, a word ere you go.
    are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?
  tranio. and if i be, sir, is it any offence?
  gremio. no; if without more words you will get you hence.
  tranio. why, sir, i pray, are not the streets as free
    for me as for you?
  gremio. but so is not she.

  tranio. for what reason, i beseech you?
  gremio. for this reason, if you'll know,
    that she's the choice love of signior gremio.
  hortensio. that she's the chosen of signior hortensio.
  tranio. softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen,
    do me this right- hear me with patience.
    baptista is a noble gentleman,
    to whom my father is not all unknown,
    and, were his daughter fairer than she is,
    she may more suitors have, and me for one.

  lucentio. sir, give him head; i know he'll prove a jade.
  petruchio. hortensio, to what end are all these words?
  hortensio. sir, let me be so bold as ask you,
    did you yet ever see baptista's daughter?
  tranio. no, sir, but hear i do that he hath two:
    the one as famous for a scolding tongue
    as is the other for beauteous modesty.
  petruchio. sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.
  gremio. yea, leave that labour to great hercules,
    and let it be more than alcides' twelve.
  petruchio. sir, understand you this of me, in sooth:

    achieve the elder, set the younger free
    for our access- whose hap shall be to have her
    will not so graceless be to be ingrate.

hear so well.
  baptista. sir, pardon me in what i have to say.
    your plainness and your shortness please me well.
    right true it is your son lucentio here
    doth love my daughter, and she loveth him,
    or both dissemble deeply their affections;
    and therefore, if you say no more than this,
    that like a father you will deal with him,
    and pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
    the match is made, and all is done-
    your son shall have my daughter with consent.
  tranio. i thank you, sir. where then do you know best
    we be affied, and such assurance ta'en
    as shall with either part's agreement stand?
  baptista. not in my house, lucentio, for you know
    pitchers have ears, and i have many servants;
    besides, old gremio is heark'ning still,
    and happily we might be interrupted.
  tranio. then at my lodging, an it like you.
    there doth my father lie; and there this night
    we'll pass the business privately and well.

    and bid bianca make her ready straight;
    and, if you will, tell what hath happened-
    lucentio's father is arriv'd in padua,
