mannie! was ‘ou frightened, love?... there now, love! there now!... lambabaun! mamma’s little lamb of the world!... there now!”
little chandler felt his cheeks suffused with shame and he stood back out of the lamplight. he listened while the paroxysm of the child’s sobbing grew less and less; and tears of remorse started to his eyes.

the bell rang furiously and, when miss parker went to the tube, a furious voice called out in a piercing north of ireland accent:
“send farrington here!”
miss parker returned to her machine, saying to a man who was writing at a desk:
“mr alleyne wants you upstairs.”
the man muttered “blast him!” under his breath and pushed back his chair to stand up. when he stood up he was tall and of great bulk. he had a hanging face, dark wine-coloured, with fair eyebrows and moustache: his eyes bulged forward slightly and the whites of them were dirty. he lifted up the counter and, passing by the clients, went out of the office with a heavy

 he came to the second landing, where a door bore a brass plate with the inscription mr alleyne. here he halted, puffing with labour and vexation, and knocked. the shrill voice cried:
“come in!”
the man entered mr alleyne’s room. simultaneously mr alleyne, a little man wearing gold-rimmed glasses on a clean-shaven face, shot his head up over a pile of documents. the head itself was so pink and hairless it seemed like a large egg reposing on the papers. mr alleyne did not lose a moment:
“farrington? what is the meaning of this? why have i always to complain of you? may i ask you why you haven’t made a copy of that contract between bodley and kirwan? i told you it must be ready by four o’clock.”
“but mr shelley said, sir——”
“mr shelley said, sir.... kindly attend to what i say and not to what mr shelley says, sir. you have always some excuse or another for shirking work. let me tell you that if the contract is not copied before this evening i’ll lay the matter before mr c

ion and felt that he must have a good night’s drinking. the middle of the month was passed and, if he could get the copy done in time, mr alleyne might give him an order on the cashier. he stood still, gazing fixedly at the head upon the pile of papers. suddenly mr alleyne began to upset all the papers, searching for something. then, as if he had been unaware of the man’s presence till that moment, he shot up his head again, saying:
“eh? are you going to stand there all day? upon my word, farrington, you take things easy!”
“i was waiting to see....”
“very good, you needn’t wait to see. go downstairs and do your work.”
the man walked heavily towards the door and, as he went out of the room, he heard mr alleyne cry after him that if the contract was not copied by evening mr crosbie would hear of the matter.
he returned to his desk in the lower office and counted the sheets which remained to be copied. he took up his pen and dipped it in the ink but he continued to stare stupidly

ses of tram-gongs and swishing trolleys and his nose already sniffed the curling fumes of punch. as he walked on he preconsidered the terms in which he would narrate the incident to the boys:
“so, i just looked at him—coolly, you know, and looked at her. then i looked back at him again—taking my time, you know. ‘i don’t think that that’s a fair question to put to me,’ says i.”
nosey flynn was sitting up in his usual corner of davy byrne’s and, when he heard the story, he stood farrington a half-one, saying it was as smart a thing as ever he heard. farrington stood a drink in his turn. after a while o’halloran and paddy leonard came in and the story was repeated to them. o’halloran stood tailors of malt, hot, all round and told the story of the retort he had made to the chief clerk when he was in callan’s of fownes’s street; but, as the retort was after the manner of the liberal shepherds in the eclogues, he had to admit that it was not as clever as farrington’s retort

. at this farrington told the boys to polish off that and have another.
just as they were naming their poisons who should come in but higgins! of course he had to join in with the others. the men asked him to give his version of it, and he did so with great vivacity for the sight of five small hot whiskies was very exhilarating. everyone roared laughing when he showed the way in which mr alleyne shook his fist in farrington’s face. then he imitated farrington, saying, “and here was my nabs, as cool as you please,” while farrington looked at the company out of his heavy dirty eyes, smiling and at times drawing forth stray drops of liquor from his moustache with the aid of his lower lip.
when that round was over there was a pause. o’halloran had money but neither of the other two seemed to have any; so the whole party left the shop somewhat regretfully. at the corner of duke street higgins and nosey flynn bevelled off to the left while the other

 three turned back towards the city. rain was drizzling down on the cold streets and, when they reached the ballast office, farrington suggested the scotch house. the bar was full of men and loud with the noise of tongues and glasses. the three men pushed past the whining match-sellers at the door and formed a little party at the corner of the counter. they began to exchange stories. leonard introduced them to a young fellow named weathers who was performing at the tivoli as an acrobat and knockabout artiste. farrington stood a drink all round. weathers said he would take a small irish and apollinaris. farrington, who had defi

nite notions of what was what, asked the boys would they have an apollinaris too; but the boys told tim to make theirs hot. the talk became theatrical. o’halloran stood a round and then farrington stood another round, weathers protesting that the hospitality was too irish. he promised to get them in behind the scenes and introduce them to some nice girls. o’halloran said that he and leonard would go, but that farrington wouldn’t go because he was a married man; and farrington’s heavy dirty eyes leered at the company in token that he understood he was being chaffed. weathers made them all have just one little tincture at his expense and promised to meet them later on at mulligan’s in poolbeg street.
when the scotch house closed they went round to mulligan’s. they went into the parlour at the back and o’halloran ordered small hot specials all round. they were all beginning to feel mellow. farrington was just standing another round when weathers came back. much

 to farrington’s relief he drank a glass of bitter this time. funds were getting low but they had enough to keep them going. presently two young women with big hats and a young man in a check suit came in and sat at a table close by. weathers saluted them and told the company that they were out of the tivoli. farrington’s eyes wandered at every moment in the direction of one of the young women. there was something striking in her appearance. an immense scarf of peacock-blue muslin was wound round her hat and knotted in a great bow under her chin; and she wore bright yellow gloves, reaching to the elbow. farrington gazed admiringly at the plump arm which she moved very often and with much grace; and when, after a little time, she answered his gaze he admired still more her large dark brown eyes. the oblique s

 at him, but he was disappointed. he cursed his want of money and cursed all the rounds he had stood, particularly all the whiskies and apollinaris which he had stood to weathers. if there was one thing that he hated it was a sponge. he was so angry that he lost count of the conversation of his friends.
when paddy leonard called him he found that they were talking about feats of strength. weathers was showing his biceps muscle to the company and boasting so much that the other two had called on farrington to uphold the national honour. farrington pulled up his sleeve accordingly and showed his biceps muscle to the company. the two arms were examined and compared and finally it was agreed to have a trial of strength. the table was cleared and the two men rested their elbows on it, clasping hands. when paddy leonard said “go!” each was to try to bring down the other’s hand on to the table. farrington looked very serious and determined.
the trial began. after about thirty seconds weathers bro

ught his opponent’s hand slowly down on to the table. farrington’s dark wine-coloured face flushed darker still with anger and humiliation at having been defeated by such a stripling.
“you’re not to put the weight of your body behind it. play fair,” he said.
“who’s not playing fair?” said the other.
“come on again. the two best out of three.”
the trial began again. the veins stood out on farrington’s forehead, and the pallor of weathers’ complexion changed to peony. their hands and arms trembled under the stress. after a long struggle weathers again brought his opponent’s hand slowly on to the table. there was a murmur of applause from the spectators. the curate, who was standing beside the table, nodded his red head towards the victor and said with stupid familiarity:
“ah! that’s the knack!”
“what the hell do you know about it?” said farrington fiercely, turning on the ma

n. “what do you put in your gab for?”
“sh, sh!” said o’halloran, observing the violent expression of farrington’s face. “pony up, boys. we’ll have just one little smahan more and then we’ll be off.”

a very sullen-faced man stood at the corner of o’connell bridge waiting for the little sandymount tram to take him home. he was full of smouldering anger and revengefulness. he felt humiliated and discontented; he did not even feel drunk; and he had only twopence in his pocket. he cursed everything. he had done for himself in the office, pawned his watch, spent all his money; and he had not even
