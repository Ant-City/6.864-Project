was only that he made people feel as if they did not exist. he just stood looking. he would not 
answer.

"but what i say," she continued, "is that if one suffers in this world, it's on account of error. of 
course, you'll have to give up the architect profession now, won't you? but then a young man 
can always earn a decent living clerking or selling or something."

he turned to go.

"oh, mr. roark!" she called.

"yes?"

"the dean phoned for you while you were out."

for once, she expected some emotion from him; and an emotion would be the equivalent of 
seeing him broken. she did not know what it was about him that had always made her want to 
see him broken.

"yes?" he asked.

"the dean," she repeated uncertainly, trying to recapture her effect. "the dean himself 
through his secretary."

"well?"

"she said to tell you that the dean wanted to see you immediately the moment you got back."

"thank you."

"what do you su

lord for any small success that comes his way. but if that boy isn't the greatest architect of 
this u.s.a., his mother will want to know the reason why!"

he moved to go.

"but what am i doing, gabbing with you like that!" she said brightly. "you've got to hurry and 
change and run along. the dean's waiting for you."

she stood looking after him through the screen door, watching his gaunt figure move across 
the rigid neatness of her parlor. he always made her uncomfortable in the house, with a 
vague feeling of apprehension, as if she were waiting to see him swing out suddenly and 
smash her coffee tables, her chinese vases, her framed photographs. he had never shown 
any inclination to do so. she kept expecting it, without knowing why.

roark went up the stairs to his room. it was a la

raight through his 
neat drawing. he stopped once in a while and stood looking at it, his fingertips pressed to the 
paper; as if his hands held the building. his hands had long fingers, hard veins, prominent 
joints and wristbones.

an hour later he heard a knock at his door.

"come in!" he snapped, without stopping.

"mr. roark!" gasped mrs. keating, staring at him from the threshold. "what on earth are you 
doing?"

he turned and looked at her, trying to remember who she was.

"how about the dean?" she moaned. "the dean that's waiting for you?"

"oh," said roark. "oh, yes. i forgot."

"you...forgot?"

"yes." there was a note of wonder in his voice, astonished by her astonishment.

"well, all i can say," she choked, "is that it serves you right! it just serves you right. and with 
the commencement beginning at four-thirty, how do you expect him to have time to see you?"

"i'll go at once, mrs. keating."

it was not her curiosity alone that prompted her to action; it was a secret fear tha

sentence of the board might be revoked. he went to the bathroom at the end of the hall; she 
watched him washing his hands, throwing his loose, straight hair back into a semblance of 
order. he came out again, he was on his way to the stairs before she realized that he was 
leaving.

"mr. roark!" she gasped, pointing at his clothes. "you're not going like this?"

"why not?"

"but it's your dean!"

"not any more, mrs. keating."

she thought, aghast, that he said it as if he were actually happy.

the stanton institute of technology stood on a hill, its crenelated walls raised as a crown over 
the city stretched below. it looked like a medieval fortress, with a gothic cathedral grafted to 
its belly. the fortress was eminently suited to its purpose, with stout, brick walls, a few slits 
wide enough for sentries, ramparts behind which defending archers could hide, and corner

om which boiling oil could be poured upon the attacker--should such an emergency 
arise in an institute of learning. the cathedral rose over it in lace splendor, a fragile defense 
against two great enemies: light and air.

the dean's office looked like a chapel, a pool of dreamy twilight fed by one tall window of 
stained glass. the twilight flowed in through the garments of stiff saints, their arms contorted 
at the elbows. a red spot of light and a purple one rested respectively upon two genuine 
gargoyles squatting at the corners of a fireplace that had never been used. a green spot stood 
in the center of a picture of the parthenon, suspended over the fireplace.

when roark entered the office, the outlines of the dean

's figure swam dimly behind his desk, 
which was carved like a confessional. he was a short, plumpish gentleman whose spreading 
flesh was held in check by an indomitable dignity.

"ah, yes, roark," he smiled. "do sit down, please."

roark sat down. the dean entwined his fingers on his stomach and waited for the plea he 
expected. no plea came. the dean cleared his throat.

"it will be unnecessary for me to express my regret at the unfortunate event of this morning," 
he began, "since i take it for granted that you have always known my sincere interest in your 
welfare."

"quite unnecessary," said roark.

the dean looked at him dubiously, but continued:

"needless to say, i did not vote against you. i abstained entirely. but you may be glad to know 
that you had quite a determined little group of defenders at the meeting. small, but 
determine

extremes? why neglect what may be 
termed the artistic and inspirational side of your profession and concentrate on all those dry, 
technical, mathematical subjects? you intended to become an architect, not a civil engineer."

"isn't this superfluous?" roark asked. "it's past. there's no point in discussing my choice of 
subjects now."

"i am endeavoring to be helpful, roark. you must be fair about this. you cannot say that you 
were not given many warnings before this happened."

"i was."

the dean moved in his chair. roark made him uncomfortable. roark's eyes were fixed on 
him politely. the dean thought, there's nothing wrong with the way he's looking at me, in fact 
it's quite correct, most properly attentive; only, it's as if i were not here.

"every problem you were given," the dean went on, "every project you had to design--what did 
you do with it? every one of them done in that--well, i cannot call it a style--in that incredible 
manner of yours. it is contrary to every principle

ecause they did not know what to 
make of it. but, when you were given an exercise in the historical styles, a tudor chapel or a 
french opera house to design--and you turned in something that looked like a lot of boxes 
piled together without rhyme or reason--would you say it was an answer to an assignment or 
plain insubordination?"

"it was insubordination," said roark.

"we wanted to give you a chance--in view of your brilliant record in all other subjects. but 
when you turn in this--" the dean slammed his fist down on a sheet spread before him--"this 
as a renaissance villa for your final project of the year--really, my boy, it was too much!"

the sheet bore a drawing--a house of glass and concrete. in the comer there was a sharp, 
angular signature: howard roark.

"how do you expect us to pass you after this?"

"i don't."

"you left us no choice in the matter. naturally, you would feel bitterness toward us at this 
moment, but..."

"i feel nothing of the kind," said roark quietly. "

i owe you an apology. i don't usually let things

should have left long ago."

"now, now, don't get discouraged. this is not the right attitude to take. particularly in view of 
what i am going to tell you."

the dean smiled and leaned forward confidentially, enjoying the overture to a good deed.

"here is the real purpose of our interview. i was anxious to let you know as soon as possible. i 
did not wish to leave you disheartened. oh, i did, personally, take a chance with the 
president's temper when i mentioned this to him, but...mind you, he did not commit himself, 
but...here is how things stand: now that you realize how serious it is, if you take a year off, to 
rest, to think it over--shall we say to

 i cannot promise anything--this is strictly unofficial--it would be most unusual, 
but in view of the circumstances and of your brilliant record, there might be a very good

roark smiled. it was not a happy smile, it was not a grateful one. it was a simple, easy smile 
and it was amused.

"i don't think you understood me," said roark. "what made you suppose that i want to come 
back?"

"eh?"

"i won't be back. i have nothing further to learn here."

"i don't understand you," said the dean stiffly.

"is there any point in explaining? it's of no interest to you any longer."

"you will kindly explain yourself."

"if you wish. i want to be an architect, not an archeologist. i see no purpose in doing 
renaissance villas. why learn to design them, when i'll never build them?"

"my dear boy, the great style of the renaissance is far from dead. houses of that style are 
being erected every day."

"they are. and they will be. but not by me."

"come, come, now, this is childish."

"i cam

'

an hour ago the dean had wished that this interview would proceed as calmly as possible. 
now he wished that roark would display some emotion; it seemed unnatural for him to be so 
quietly natural in the circumstances.

"do you mean to tell me that you're thinking seriously of building that way, when and if you are 
an architect?"

"yes."

"my dear fellow, who will let you?"

"that's not the point. the point is, who will stop me?"

"look here, this is serious. i am sorry that i haven't had a long, earnest talk with

 a modernistic building or two, 
and it gave you ideas. but do you realize what a passing fancy that whole so-called modern 
movement is? you must learn to understand--and it has been proved by all authorities--that 
everything beautiful in architecture has been done already. there is a treasure mine in every 
style of the past. we can only choose from the great masters. who are we to improve upon 
them? we can only attempt, respectfully, to repeat."

"why?" asked howard roark.

no, thought the dean, no, he hasn't said anything else; it's a perfectly innocent word; he's not 
threatening me.

"but it's self-evident!" said the dean.

"look," said roark evenly, and pointed at the window. "can you see the campus and the 
town? do you see how many men are walking and living down there? well, i don't give a 
damn what any or all of them think about architecture--or about anything else, for that matter. 
why should i consider what their grandfathers thought of it?"

"that is our sacred tradition.
 
 ___________________________
 
"

"why?"

"for heaven's sake, can't you stop being so naive about it?"

"but i don't understand. why do you want me to think that this is great architecture?" he 
pointed to the picture of the parthenon.

"that," said the dean, "is the parthenon."

"so it is."

"i haven't the time to waste on silly questions."

"all right, then." roark got up, he took a long ruler from the desk, he walked to the picture. 
"shall i tell you what's rotten about it?"

"it's the parthenon!" said the dean.

"yes, god damn it, the parthenon!"

the ruler struck the glass over the picture.

"look," said roark. "the famous flutings on the famous columns--what are they there for? to 
hide the joints in wood--when columns were made of wood, only these aren't, they're marble. 
the triglyphs, what are they? wood. wooden beams, the way they had to be laid when people 
began to build wooden shacks. your greeks took marble and they made copies of their 
wooden structures out of it, because others had done

 it that way. then your masters of the 
renaissance came along and made copies in plaster of copies in marble of copies in wood. 
now here we are, making copies in steel and concrete of copies in plaster of copies in marble 
of copies in wood. why?"

the dean sat watching him curiously. something puzzled him, not in the words, but in roark's 
manner of saying them.

"rules?" said roark. "here are my rules: what can be done with one substance must never be 
done with another. no two materials are alike. no two sites on earth are alike. no two 
buildings have the same purpose. the purpose, the site, the material determine the shape. 
nothing can be reasonable or beautiful unless it's made by one central idea, and the idea sets 
every detail. a buildin

important--what others have done? why does it become sacred by the mere fact of not being 
your own? why is anyone and everyone right--so long as it's not yourself? why does the 
number of those others take the place of truth? why is truth made a mere matter of 
arithmetic--and only of addition at that? why is everything twisted out of all sense to fit 
everything else? there must be some reason. i don't know. i've never known it. i'd like to 
understand."

"for heaven's sake," said the dean. "sit down....that's better....would you mind very much 
putting that ruler down?...thank you....now listen to me. no one has ever denied the 
importance of modern technique to an architect. we must learn to adapt the beauty of the 
past to the needs of the present. the voice of the past is the voice of the people. nothing has 
ever been invented by one man in architecture. the proper creative process is a slow, 
gradual, anonymous, collective one, in which each man collaborates with all the ot

said roark quietly, "i have, let's say, sixty years to live. most of that time will be 
spent working. i've chosen the work i want to do. if i find no joy in it, then i'm only condemning 
myself to sixty years of torture. and i can find the joy only if i do my work in the best way 
possible to me. but the best is a matter of standards--and i set my own standards. i inherit 
nothing. i stand at the end of no tradition. i may, perhaps, stand at the beginning of one."

"how old are you?" asked the dean.

"twenty-two," said roark.

"quite excusable," said the dean; he seemed relieved. "you'll outgrow all that." he smiled. 
"the old standards have lived for thousands of years and nobody has been able to improve 
upon them. what are your modernists? a transient mode, exhibitionists trying to attract 
attention. have you observed the course of their careers? can you name one who has 
achieved any permanent distinction? look at henry cameron. a great man, a leading 
architect twenty years ago. wha

a friend of yours?"

"no. but i've seen his buildings."

"and you found them..."

"i said we won't discuss henry cameron."

"very well. you must realize that i am allowing you a great deal of...shall we say, latitude? i am
not accustomed to hold a discussion with a student who behaves in your manner. however, i 
am anxious to forestall, if possible, what appears to be a tragedy, the spectacle of a young 
man of your obvious mental gifts setting out deliberately to make a mess of his life."

the dean wondered why he had promised the professor of mathematics to do all he could for 
this boy. merely because the professor had said: "this," and pointed to roark's project, "is a 
great man." a great man, thought the dean, or a criminal. the dean winced. he did not 
approve of either.

he thought of what he had heard about roark's past. roark's father had been a steel puddler 
somewhere in ohio and had died long ago. the boy's entrance papers showed no record of 
nearest relatives. when asked abo

eemed astonished that he should be expected to 
have any interest in the matter. he had not made or sought a single friend on the campus. he 
had refused to join a fraternity. he had worked his way through high school and through the 
three years here at the institute. he had worked as a common laborer in the building trades 
since childhood. he had done plastering, plumbing, steel work, anything he could get, going 
from one small town to another, working his way east, to the great cities. the dean had seen 
him, last summer, on his vacation, catching rivets on a skyscraper in construction in boston; 
his long body relaxed under greasy overalls, only his eyes intent, and his right arm swinging 
forward, once in a while, expertly, without effort, to catch the flying ball of fire at the last 
moment, when it seemed that the hot rivet would miss the bucket and strike him in the face.

"look here, roark," said the dean gently. "you have worked hard for your education. you had

eft to go. there is something important to consider, particularly for a boy in your 
position. there's the practical side of an architect's career to think about. an architect is not an 
end in himself. he is only a small part of a great social whole. co-operation is the key word to 
our modern world and to the profession of architecture in particular. have you thought of your 
potential clients?"

"yes," said roark.

"the client," said the dean. "the client. think of that above all. he's the one to live in the 
house you build. your only purpose is to serve him. you must aspire to give the proper artistic 
expression to his wishes. isn't that all one can say on the subject?"

"well, i could say that i must aspire to build for my client the most comfortable, the most 
logical, the most beautiful house that can be built. i could say that i must try to sell him the 
best i have and also teach him to know the best. i could say it, but i w

on't. because i don't

intend to have clients in order to build."

"how do you propose to force your ideas on them?"

"i don't propose to force or be forced. those who want me will come to me."

then the dean understood what had puzzled him in roark's manner.

"you know," he said, "you would sound much more convincing if you spoke as if you cared 
whether i agreed with you or not."

"that's true," said roark. "i don't care whether you agree with me or not." he said it so simply 

that it did not sound offensive, it sounded like the statement of a fact which he noticed, 
puzzled, for the first time.

"you don't care what others think--which might be understandable. but you don't care even to 
make t

hem think as you do?"

"no."

"but that's...that's monstrous."

"is it? probably. i couldn't say."

"i'm glad of this interview," said the dean, suddenly, too loudly. "it has relieved my conscience. 
i believe, as others stated at the meeting, that the profession of architecture is not for you. i 
have tried to help you. now i agree with the board. you are a man not to be encouraged. you 
are dangerous."

"to whom?" asked roark.

but the dean rose, indicating that the interview was over.

roark left the room. he walked slowly through the long halls, down the stairs, out to the lawn 
below. he had met many men such as the dean; he had never understood them. he knew 
only that there was some important difference between his actions and theirs. it had ceased to 
disturb him long ago. but he always looked for a central theme in buildings and he looked for 
a central impulse in men. he knew the source of his actions; he could not discove

r theirs. he 
did not care. he had never learned the process of thinking about other people. but he 
wondered, at times, what made them such as they were. he wondered again, thinking of the 
dean. there was an important secret involved somewhere in that question, he thought. there 
was a principle which he must discover.

but he stopped. he saw the sunlight of late afternoon, held still in the moment before it was to 
fade, on the gray limestone of a stringcourse running along the brick wall of the institute 
building. he forgot men, the dean and the principle behind the dean, which he wanted to 
discover. he thought only of how lovely the stone looked in the fragile light and of what h

then he was shaking hands, scratching the perspiration off his face with the end of a rolled 
parchment, nodding, smiling, suffocating in his black gown and hoping that people would not 
notice his mother sobbing with her arms about him. the president of the institute shook his 
hand, booming: "stanton will be proud of you, my boy." the dean shook his hand, repeating: 
"...a glorious future...a glorious future...a glorious future..." professor peterkin shook his hand, 
and patted his shoulder, saying: "...and you'll find it absolutely essential; for example, i had the 
experience when i built the peabody post office..." keating did not listen to the rest, because 
he had heard the story of the peabody post office many times. it was the only structure 
anyone had ever known professor peterkin to have erected, before he sacrificed hi

ut my business, when you've just been...?"

"i said forget about that. what is it?"

"you know," said keating honestly and unexpectedly even to himself, "i've often thought that 
you're crazy. but i know that you know many things about it--architecture, i mean--which those 
fools never knew. and i know that you love it as they never will."

"well?"

"well, i don't know why i should come to you, but--howard, i've never said it before, but you 
see, i'd rather have your opinion on things than the dean's--i'd probably follow the dean's, but 
it's just that yours means more to me myself, i don't know why. i don't know why i'm saying 
this, either."

roark turned over on his side, looked at him, and laughed. it was a young, kind, friendly 
laughter, a thing so rare to hear from roark that keating felt as if someone had taken his hand
in reassurance; and he forgot that he had a party in boston waiting for him.

"come on," said roark, "you're not being afraid of me, are you? what do you want to a

a coward, but i'm afraid of it. and that's all i know--only that it exists. i don't know its purpose, i 
don't know its nature."

"the principle behind the dean," said roark.

"what?"

"it's something i wonder about once in a while....mallory, why did you try to shoot ellsworth 
toohey?" he saw the boy's eyes, and he added: "you don't have to tell me if you don't like to 
talk about it."

"i don't like to talk about it," said mallory, his voice tight. "but it was the right question to ask."

"sit down," said roark. "we'll talk about your commission."

then mallory listened attentively while roark spoke of the building and of what he wanted

roark turned away. when he looked back at wynand, he said only:

"i hope so, gail."

"what have you been thinking about these past weeks?"

"the principle behind the dean who fired me from stanton."

"what principle?"

"the thing that is destroying the world. the thing you were talking about. actual selflessness."

"the ideal which they say does not exist?"

"they're wrong. it does exist--though not in the way they imagine. it's what i couldn't 
understand about people for a long time. they have no self. they live within others. they live 
second-hand. look at peter keating."

"you look at him. i hate his guts."

"i've looked at him--at what's left of him--and i
