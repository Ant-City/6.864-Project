top until everybody in
there was dead.
 so the americans put their weapons down, and they came out of the woods with their
hands on top of their heads, because they wanted to go on living, if they possibly could.
 billy traveled in time back to the veterans' hospital again. the blanket was over his
head. it was quiet outside the blanket. "is my mother gone?' said billy.
 'yes.'
 billy peeked out from under his blanket. his fianc√©e was out there now, sitting on the
visitor's chair. her name was valencia merble. valencia was the daughter of the owner of
the ilium school of optometry. she was rich. she was as big as a house because she
couldn't stop eating. she was eating now. she was eating a three musketeers candy bar.
she was wearing trifocal lenses in harlequin frames, and the frames were trimmed with
rhinestones. the glitter of the rhinestones was answered by the glitter of the diamond in
her engagement ring. the diamond was insured for eighteen hundred dollars. billy had
found that diamond in ger

 he changed the subject now, congratulated valencia on her engagement ring.
 'thank you,' she said, and held it out so rosewater could get a close look. 'billy got
that diamond in the war.'
 'that's the attractive thing about war,' said rosewater. absolutely everybody gets a
little something.'
 with regard to the whereabouts of kilgore trout: he actually lived in ilium, billy's
hometown, friendless and despised. billy would meet him by and by.
 'billy' said valencia merble.
 'hm?'
 'you want to talk about our silver pattern? '
 'sure.'
 'i've got it narrowed down pretty much to either royal danish or rambler rose.'
 'rambler rose,' said billy.
 'it isn't something we should rush into,' she said. 'i mean whatever we decide on, that's
what we're going to have to live with the rest of our lives.'
 billy studied the pictures. 'royal danish.' he said at last.
 'colonial moonlight is nice, too.'
 'yes, it is,' said billy pilgrim.
 and billy traveled in time to the zoo

 there isn't anything we can do about them, so we simply don't look at them. we
ignore them. we spend eternity looking at pleasant moments-like today at the zoo. isn't
this a nice moment?'
 'yes.'
 'that's one thing earthlings might learn to do, if they tried hard enough: ignore the
awful times, and concentrate on the good ones.'
 'um,' said billy pilgrim.
 shortly after he went to sleep that night, billy traveled in time to another moment
which was quite nice, his wedding night with the former valencia merble. he had been
out of the veterans' hospital for six months. he was all well. he had graduated from the
ilium school of optometry-third in his class of forty-seven.
 now he was in bed with valencia in a delightful studio apartment which was built on
the end of a wharf on cape ann, massachusetts. across the water were the lights of
gloucester. billy was on top of valencia, making love to her. one result of this act
would be the birth of robert pilgrim, who would become a problem in high school, bu

didn't want to make a fool of himself by saying so. it was
supposed to carry billy and twenty-eight other optometrists to a convention in montreal.
 his wife, valencia, was outside, and his father-in-law, lionel merble, was strapped to
the seat beside him.
 lionel merble was a machine. tralfamadorians, of course, say that every creature and
plant in the universe is a machine. it amuses them that so many earthlings are offended
by the idea of being machines.
 outside the plane, the machine named valencia merble pilgrim was eating a peter paul
mound bar and waving bye-bye.
 the plane took off without incident. the moment was structured that way. there was a
barbershop quartet on board. they were optometrists, too. they called themselves 'the
febs,' which was an acronym for 'four-eyed bastards.'
 when the plane was safely aloft, the machine that was bill's father-in-law asked the
quartet to sing his favorite song. they knew what song he meant, and they sang it, and it
went like this:
