 wrath of the chief evaporated, and in a few moments he
was as placid as ever. laying his hand upon his breast, he gave me to
understand that his name was ‘mehevi’, and that, in return, he wished me
to communicate my appellation. i hesitated for an instant, thinking that
it might be difficult for him to pronounce my real name, and then with
the most praiseworthy intentions intimated that i was known as ‘tom’.
but i could not have made a worse selection; the chief could not master
it. ‘tommo,’ ‘tomma’, ‘tommee’, everything but plain ‘tom’. as he
persisted in garnishing the word with an additional syllable, i
compromised the matter with him at the word ‘tommo’; and by that name
i went during the entire period of my stay in the valley. the same
proceeding was gone through with toby, whose mellifluous appellation was
more easily caught.

an exchange of names is equivalent to a ratification of good will and
amity among these simple people; and as we were aware of this

iselessly, nay stealthily, and glided along through the
gloom that surrounded us as if about to spring upon some object they
were fearful of disturbing before they should make sure of it.--gracious
heaven! the horrible reflections which crowded upon me that moment.--a
cold sweat stood upon my brow, and spell-bound with terror i awaited my
fate!

suddenly the silence was broken by the well-remembered tones of mehevi,
and at the kindly accents of his voice my fears were immediately
dissipated. ‘tommo, toby, ki ki!’ (eat). he had waited to address us,
until he had assured himself that we were both awake, at which he seemed
somewhat surprised.

‘ki ki! is it?’ said toby in his gruff tones; ‘well, cook us first, will
you--but what’s this?’ he added, as another savage appeared, bearing
before him a large trencher of wood containing some kind of steaming
meat, as appeared from the odours it diffused, and which he deposited at
the feet of mehevi. ‘a baked baby, i dare say i but i wi

indeed, waked up here in the middle of the night, stuffing and guzzling,
and all to make a fat meal for a parcel of booby-minded cannibals one
of these mornings!--no, i see what they are at very plainly, so i am
resolved to starve myself into a bunch of bones and gristle, and then,
if they serve me up, they are welcome! but i say, tommo, you are not
going to eat any of that mess there, in the dark, are you? why, how can
you tell what it is?’

‘by tasting it, to be sure,’ said i, masticating a morsel that kory-kory
had just put in my mouth, ‘and excellently good it is, too, very much
like veal.’

‘a baked baby, by the soul of captain cook!’ burst forth toby, with
amazing vehemence; ‘veal? why there never was a calf on the island
till you landed. i tell you you are bolting down mouthfuls from a dead

 of my
companion and myself. in addressing me--especially when i lay reclining
upon the mats suffering from pain--there was a tenderness in her manner
which it was impossible to misunderstand or resist. whenever she entered
the house, the expression of her face indicated the liveliest sympathy
for me; and moving towards the place where i lay, with one arm slightly
elevated in a gesture of pity, and her large glistening eyes gazing
intently into mine, she would murmur plaintively, ‘awha! awha! tommo,’
and seat herself mournfully beside me.

her manner convinced me that she deeply compassionated my situation, as
being removed from my country and friends, and placed beyond the reach
of all relief. indeed, at times i was almost led to believe that her
mind was swayed by gentle impulses hardly to be anticipated from one in
her condition; that she appeared to be conscious there were ties rudely
severed, which had once bound us to our homes; that there were sisters
and brothers anxiously looki

tinor placed before him a calabash of poee-poee, from which the stranger
regaled himself, alternating every mouthful with some rapid exclamation,
which was eagerly caught up and echoed by the crowd that completely
filled the house. when i observed the striking devotion of the natives
to him, and their temporary withdrawal of all attention from myself, i
felt not a little piqued. the glory of tommo is departed, thought i, and
the sooner he removes from the valley the better. these were my feelings
at the moment, and they were prompted by that glorious principle
inherent in all heroic natures--the strong-rooted determination to have
the biggest share of the pudding or to go without any of it.

inhaled a few whiffs from a pipe which was handed to him, launched

e after me, and trusting that the
indolence of the savages would prevent them from repairing my neglect,
would return to my mat, and waiting patiently until all were again
asleep, i would then steal forth, and at once take the route to
pueearka.

the very night which followed marnoo’s departure, i proceeded to put
this project into execution. about midnight, as i imagined, i arose and
drew the slide. the natives, just as i had expected, started up, while
some of them asked, ‘arware poo awa, tommo?’ (where are you going,
tommo?) ‘wai’ (water) i laconically answered, grasping the calabash. on
hearing my reply they sank back again, and in a minute or two i returned
to my mat, anxiously awaiting the result of the experiment.

one after another the savages, turning restlessly, appeared to resume
their slumbers, and rejoicing at the stillness which prevailed, i was
about to rise again from my couch, when i heard a slight rustling--a
dark form was intercepted between me and the doorway--

nd was now with three chiefs, her
sons, on a visit to her kinsmen.

as the old king’s wife left him, jimmy again came up to toby, and told
him that he had just talked the whole matter over with the natives, and
there was only one course for him to follow. they would not allow him to
go back into the valley, and harm would certainly come to both him and
me, if he remained much longer on the beach. ‘so,’ said he, ‘you and i
had better go to nukuheva now overland, and tomorrow i will bring tommo,
as they call him, by water; they have promised to carry him down to the
sea for me early in the morning, so that there will be no delay.’

‘no, no,’ said toby desperately, ‘i will not leave him that way; we must
escape together.’

‘then there is no hope for you,’ exclaimed the sailor, ‘for if i leave
you here on the beach, as soon as i am gone you will be carried back
into the valley, and then neither of you will ever look upon the
sea again.’ and with many oaths he swore tha

guaranty for the other’s return.
this is only my own supposition, however, for as to all their strange
conduct, it is still a mystery.

‘you see what sort of a taboo man i am,’ said the sailor, after for some
time silently following the path which led up the mountain. ‘mow-mow
made me a present of this pig here, and the man who carries it will
go right through happar, and down into nukuheva with us. so long as he
stays by me he is safe, and just so it will be with you, and tomorrow
with tommo. cheer up, then, and rely upon me, you will see him in the
morning.’

the ascent of the mountain was not very difficult, owing to its being
near to the sea, where the island ridges are comparatively low; the
path, too, was a fine one, so that in a short time all three were
standing on the summit with the two valleys at their feet. the white
cascade marking the green head of the typee valley first caught toby’s
eye; marheyo’s house could easily be traced by them.

, which were manned by tabooed natives. toby, of course, was
all eagerness to go along, but the sailor told him that if he did, it
would spoil all; so, hard as it was, he was obliged to remain.

towards evening he was on the watch, and descried the boats turning the
headland and entering the bay. he strained his eyes, and thought he saw
me; but i was not there. descending from the mast almost distracted, he
grappled jimmy as he struck the deck, shouting in a voice that startled
him, ‘where is tommo?’ the old fellow faltered, but soon recovering,
did all he could to soothe him, assuring him that it had proved to be
impossible to get me down to the shore that morning; assigning many
plausible reasons, and adding that early on the morrow he was going to
visit the bay again in a french boat, when, if he did not find me on the
beach--as this time he certainly expected to--he would march right back
into the valley, and carry me away at all hazards. he, however, again
refused to allow toby to

accompany him. now, situated as toby was, his
sole dependence for the present was upon this jimmy, and therefore he
was fain to comfort himself as well as he could with what the old sailor
told him. the next morning, however, he had the satisfaction of seeing
the french boat start with jimmy in it. tonight, then, i will see him,
thought toby; but many a long day passed before he ever saw tommo again.
hardly was the boat out of sight, when the captain came forward and
ordered the anchor weighed; he was going to sea.

vain were all toby’s ravings--they were disregarded; and when he came to
himself, the sails were set, and the ship fast leaving the land.

... ‘oh!’ said he to me at our meeting, ‘what sleepless nights were
mine. often i started from my hammock, dreaming you were before me, and
upbraiding me for leaving you on the island.’
